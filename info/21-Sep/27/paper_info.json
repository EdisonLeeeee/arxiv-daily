    "abstract": "Advanced metamorphic malware and ransomware, by using obfuscation, could\nalter their internal structure with every attack. If such malware could intrude\neven into any of the IoT networks, then even if the original malware instance\ngets detected, by that time it can still infect the entire network. It is\nchallenging to obtain training data for such evasive malware. Therefore, in\nthis paper, we present ADVERSARIALuscator, a novel system that uses specialized\nAdversarial-DRL to obfuscate malware at the opcode level and create multiple\nmetamorphic instances of the same. To the best of our knowledge,\nADVERSARIALuscator is the first-ever system that adopts the Markov Decision\nProcess-based approach to convert and find a solution to the problem of\ncreating individual obfuscations at the opcode level. This is important as the\nmachine language level is the least at which functionality could be preserved\nso as to mimic an actual attack effectively. ADVERSARIALuscator is also the\nfirst-ever system to use efficient continuous action control capable of deep\nreinforcement learning agents like the Proximal Policy Optimization in the area\nof cyber security. Experimental results indicate that ADVERSARIALuscator could\nraise the metamorphic probability of a corpus of malware by >0.45.\nAdditionally, more than 33% of metamorphic instances generated by\nADVERSARIALuscator were able to evade the most potent IDS. If such malware\ncould intrude even into any of the IoT networks, then even if the original\nmalware instance gets detected, by that time it can still infect the entire\nnetwork. Hence ADVERSARIALuscator could be used to generate data representative\nof a swarm of very potent and coordinated AI-based metamorphic malware attacks.\nThe so generated data and simulations could be used to bolster the defenses of\nan IDS against an actual AI-based metamorphic attack from advanced malware and\nransomware.",

    "abstract": "Humans learn to recognize and manipulate new objects in lifelong settings\nwithout forgetting the previously gained knowledge under non-stationary and\nsequential conditions. In autonomous systems, the agents also need to mitigate\nsimilar behavior to continually learn the new object categories and adapt to\nnew environments. In most conventional deep neural networks, this is not\npossible due to the problem of catastrophic forgetting, where the newly gained\nknowledge overwrites existing representations. Furthermore, most\nstate-of-the-art models excel either in recognizing the objects or in grasp\nprediction, while both tasks use visual input. The combined architecture to\ntackle both tasks is very limited. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid model\narchitecture consists of a dynamically growing dual-memory recurrent neural\nnetwork (GDM) and an autoencoder to tackle object recognition and grasping\nsimultaneously. The autoencoder network is responsible to extract a compact\nrepresentation for a given object, which serves as input for the GDM learning,\nand is responsible to predict pixel-wise antipodal grasp configurations. The\nGDM part is designed to recognize the object in both instances and categories\nlevels. We address the problem of catastrophic forgetting using the intrinsic\nmemory replay, where the episodic memory periodically replays the neural\nactivation trajectories in the absence of external sensory information. To\nextensively evaluate the proposed model in a lifelong setting, we generate a\nsynthetic dataset due to lack of sequential 3D objects dataset. Experiment\nresults demonstrated that the proposed model can learn both object\nrepresentation and grasping simultaneously in continual learning scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Depth estimation from a single image is an active research topic in computer\nvision. The most accurate approaches are based on fully supervised learning\nmodels, which rely on a large amount of dense and high-resolution (HR)\nground-truth depth maps. However, in practice, color images are usually\ncaptured with much higher resolution than depth maps, leading to the\nresolution-mismatched effect. In this paper, we propose a novel\nweakly-supervised framework to train a monocular depth estimation network to\ngenerate HR depth maps with resolution-mismatched supervision, i.e., the inputs\nare HR color images and the ground-truth are low-resolution (LR) depth maps.\nThe proposed weakly supervised framework is composed of a sharing weight\nmonocular depth estimation network and a depth reconstruction network for\ndistillation. Specifically, for the monocular depth estimation network the\ninput color image is first downsampled to obtain its LR version with the same\nresolution as the ground-truth depth. Then, both HR and LR color images are fed\ninto the proposed monocular depth estimation network to obtain the\ncorresponding estimated depth maps. We introduce three losses to train the\nnetwork: 1) reconstruction loss between the estimated LR depth and the\nground-truth LR depth; 2) reconstruction loss between the downsampled estimated\nHR depth and the ground-truth LR depth; 3) consistency loss between the\nestimated LR depth and the downsampled estimated HR depth. In addition, we\ndesign a depth reconstruction network from depth to depth. Through distillation\nloss, features between two networks maintain the structural consistency in\naffinity space, and finally improving the estimation network performance.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance\nthan unsupervised and semi-supervised learning based schemes, and is\ncompetitive or even better compared to supervised ones.",

While\nmost current work examines the emergence of small-scale OSS projects, our\napproach draws on a large-scale historical dataset of 1.8 million GitHub users\nand their repository contributions. OSS collaborations are characterized by\nsmall groups of users that work closely together, leading to the presence of\ncommunities defined by short cycles in the underlying network structure. To\nunderstand the impact of this phenomenon, we apply a pre-processing step that\naccounts for the cyclic network structure by using Renewal-Nonbacktracking\nRandom Walks (RNBRW) and the strength of pairwise collaborations before\nimplementing the Louvain method to identify communities within the network.\nEquipping Louvain with RNBRW and the contribution strength provides a more\nassertive approach for detecting small-scale teams and reveals nontrivial\ndifferences in community detection such as users tendencies toward preferential\nattachment to more established collaboration communities. Using this method, we\nalso identify key factors that affect community formation, including the effect\nof users location and primary programming language, which was determined using\na comparative method of contribution activities.

Using an\nevaluation framework which uses real, parametrizable malware, we develop a game\nthat is played by a defender against attackers with a suite of malware that is\nparameterized to be more aggressive and more stealthy. These results are\nevaluated under a framework of exponential utility according to their\nwillingness to accept risk. We find that against a defender who must choose a\nsingle strategy up front, risk-seeking attackers gain more actual utility than\nrisk-averse attackers, particularly in cases where the defender is better\nequipped than the two attackers anticipate. Additionally, we empirically\nconfirm that high-risk, high-reward scenarios are more beneficial to\nrisk-seeking attackers like cybercriminals, while low-risk, low-reward\nscenarios are more beneficial to risk-averse attackers like advanced persistent\nthreats.",

However, the role of\nstationary versus non-stationary attributes is less explored: Stationary\nfeatures, which remain similar throughout the video, enable the prediction of\nvideo-level action classes. Non-stationary features, which represent temporally\nvarying attributes, are more beneficial for downstream tasks involving more\nfine-grained temporal understanding, such as action segmentation. We argue that\na single representation to capture both types of features is sub-optimal, and\npropose to decompose the representation space into stationary and\nnon-stationary features via contrastive learning from long and short views,\ni.e. long video sequences and their shorter sub-sequences. Stationary features\nare shared between the short and long views, while non-stationary features\naggregate the short views to match the corresponding long view. To empirically\nverify our approach, we demonstrate that our stationary features work\nparticularly well on an action recognition downstream task, while our\nnon-stationary features perform better on action segmentation.

    "abstract": "We investigate improving Monte Carlo Tree Search based solvers for Partially\nObservable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), when applied to adaptive\nsampling problems. We propose improvements in rollout allocation, the action\nexploration algorithm, and plan commitment. The first allocates a different\nnumber of rollouts depending on how many actions the agent has taken in an\nepisode. We find that rollouts are more valuable after some initial information\nis gained about the environment. Thus, a linear increase in the number of\nrollouts, i.e. allocating a fixed number at each step, is not appropriate for\nadaptive sampling tasks. The second alters which actions the agent chooses to\nexplore when building the planning tree. We find that by using knowledge of the\nnumber of rollouts allocated, the agent can more effectively choose actions to\nexplore. The third improvement is in determining how many actions the agent\nshould take from one plan. Typically, an agent will plan to take the first\naction from the planning tree and then call the planner again from the new\nstate. Using statistical techniques, we show that it is possible to greatly\nreduce the number of rollouts by increasing the number of actions taken from a\nsingle planning tree without affecting the agent's final reward. Finally, we\ndemonstrate experimentally, on simulated and real aquatic data from an\nunderwater robot, that these improvements can be combined, leading to better\nadaptive sampling.

In this paper, we\npropose a novel point convolution operator named Shell Point Convolution\n(SPConv) for shape encoding and local context learning. Specifically, SPConv\nsplits 3D neighborhood space into shells, aggregates local features on manually\ndesigned kernel points, and performs convolution on the shells. Moreover,\nSPConv incorporates a simple yet effective attention module that enhances local\nfeature aggregation. Based upon SPConv, a deep neural network named SPNet is\nconstructed to process large-scale point clouds. Poisson disk sampling and\nfeature propagation are incorporated in SPNet for better efficiency and\naccuracy. We provided details of the shell design and conducted extensive\nexperiments on challenging large-scale point cloud datasets. Experimental\nresults show that SPConv is effective in local shape encoding, and our SPNet is\nable to achieve top-ranking performances in semantic segmentation tasks.",

This new lower bound unifies existing regret\nbound results that have different dependencies on T due to the use of different\nvalues of margin parameter $\\alpha$ explicitly implied by their assumptions.\nSecond, we propose a simple and computationally efficient algorithm inspired by\nthe general Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) strategy that achieves a regret upper\nbound matching the lower bound. The proposed algorithm uses a properly centered\n$\\ell_1$-ball as the confidence set in contrast to the commonly used ellipsoid\nconfidence set. In addition, the algorithm does not require any forced sampling\nstep and is thereby adaptive to the practically unknown margin parameter.\nSimulations and a real data analysis are conducted to compare the proposed\nmethod with existing ones in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Sharing collective perception messages (CPM) between vehicles is investigated\nto decrease occlusions, so as to improve perception accuracy and safety of\nautonomous driving. However, highly accurate data sharing and low communication\noverhead is a big challenge for collective perception, especially when\nreal-time communication is required among connected and automated vehicles. In\nthis paper, we propose an efficient and effective keypoints-based deep feature\nfusion framework, called FPV-RCNN, for collective perception, which is built on\ntop of the 3D object detector PV-RCNN. We introduce a bounding box proposal\nmatching module and a keypoints selection strategy to compress the CPM size and\nsolve the multi-vehicle data fusion problem. Compared to a bird's-eye view\n(BEV) keypoints feature fusion, FPV-RCNN achieves improved detection accuracy\nby about 14% at a high evaluation criterion (IoU 0.7) on a synthetic dataset\nCOMAP dedicated to collective perception. Also, its performance is comparable\nto two raw data fusion baselines that have no data loss in sharing. Moreover,\nour method also significantly decreases the CPM size to less than 0.3KB, which\nis about 50 times smaller than the BEV feature map sharing used in previous\nworks. Even with a further decreased number of CPM feature channels, i.e., from\n128 to 32, the detection performance only drops about 1%.

    "abstract": "Provably stable flux reconstruction (FR) schemes are derived for partial\ndifferential equations cast in curvilinear coordinates. Specifically, energy\nstable flux reconstruction (ESFR) schemes are considered as they allow for\ndesign flexibility as well as stability proofs for the linear advection problem\non affine elements. Additionally, split forms are examined as they enable the\ndevelopment of energy stability proofs. The first critical step proves, that in\ncurvilinear coordinates, the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) conservative and\nnon-conservative forms are inherently different--even under exact integration\nand analytically exact metric terms. This analysis demonstrates that the split\nform is essential to developing provably stable DG schemes on curvilinear\ncoordinates and motivates the construction of metric dependent ESFR correction\nfunctions in each element. Furthermore, the provably stable FR schemes differ\nfrom schemes in the literature that only apply the ESFR correction functions to\nsurface terms or on the conservative form, and instead incorporate the ESFR\ncorrection functions on the full split form of the equations. It is\ndemonstrated that the scheme is divergent when the correction functions are\nonly used for surface reconstruction in curvilinear coordinates. We numerically\nverify the stability claims for our proposed FR split forms and compare them to\nESFR schemes in the literature. Lastly, the newly proposed provably stable FR\nschemes are shown to obtain optimal orders of convergence.

    "abstract": "In the last decade, online social media has become the primary platform for\nprotesters to organize and express their agenda in various parts of the world.\nNevertheless, scholars still debate whether online tools induce offline\nprotests or facilitate them. Unfortunately, studies of protests often lack\npanel data and cannot address how particular users change their behaviour over\ntime in line with the protest agenda. To this end, we analyze a new dataset of\nthe Facebook page EuroMaydan that was explicitly created to facilitate the\nprotest in Ukraine from November 2013 to February 2014. Moreover, our analysis\nfollows this page even after the end of the protest till June 2014. In total,\nthe dataset includes 26,631 posts and 1,470,593 comments that were generated by\n124,790 users during and after the protests. We use this panel data to test how\nparticular users switch between the two most popular languages of this page:\nUkrainian and Russian. Previous studies have puzzled with language behaviour\nduring the Ukrainian protest. Although researchers expected to see more\nUkrainian language due to national mobilization, studies discovered that\nUkrainian protesters frequently used Russian, especially after the end of the\nprotest. A hypothesis was suggested that protesters use language strategically\ndepending on circumstances (e.g., to maximize outreach). However, previous\nstudies relied on aggregated data and did not explore the within-subject\nvariation of language behaviour. Our study adds to this scholarship by adding a\nlongitudinal analysis of language behaviour. Considering the broader\ncontribution of this paper, we add to the literature on protests by validating\nprevious findings derived from surveys that activists change their behaviour to\nreflect prior preferences and situational goals rather than modify their\npreferences.",

While its implications on language production have\nbeen well explored, the hypothesis potentially makes predictions about language\ncomprehension and linguistic acceptability as well. Further, it is unclear how\nuniformity in a linguistic signal -- or lack thereof -- should be measured, and\nover which linguistic unit, e.g., the sentence or language level, this\nuniformity should hold. Here we investigate these facets of the UID hypothesis\nusing reading time and acceptability data. While our reading time results are\ngenerally consistent with previous work, they are also consistent with a weakly\nsuper-linear effect of surprisal, which would be compatible with UID's\npredictions. For acceptability judgments, we find clearer evidence that\nnon-uniformity in information density is predictive of lower acceptability. We\nthen explore multiple operationalizations of UID, motivated by different\ninterpretations of the original hypothesis, and analyze the scope over which\nthe pressure towards uniformity is exerted. The explanatory power of a subset\nof the proposed operationalizations suggests that the strongest trend may be a\nregression towards a mean surprisal across the language, rather than the\nphrase, sentence, or document -- a finding that supports a typical\ninterpretation of UID, namely that it is the byproduct of language users\nmaximizing the use of a (hypothetical) communication channel.",

We\nconsider this an important issue since such inferred graph cannot be used as\ninput for applications that require a reliable estimate of the true graph. On\nthe other hand, a graph having trace feasibility guarantees can help us better\nunderstand the true (hidden) interactions that may have taken place between\nnodes of interest. The inference of such graph is the goal of this paper.\nFirstly, given an activity log from a social network, we introduce a set of\nconstraints that take into consideration all the hidden paths that are possible\nbetween the nodes of the trace, given their timestamps of interaction.

To effectively supervise the training of this model, we combine\nreal data labelled using off-the-shelf depth sensors, as well as a number of\ndifferent rendered, simulated labeled datasets. We demonstrate the efficacy of\nour system by presenting a large number of qualitative results in the form of\ndepth maps and point-clouds, experiments validating the metric accuracy of our\nsystem and comparisons to other sensors on challenging objects and scenes.

    "abstract": "Traditional approaches to next item and next basket recommendation typically\nextract users' interests based on their past interactions and associated static\ncontextual information (e.g. a user id or item category). However, extracted\ninterests can be inaccurate and become obsolete. Dynamic attributes, such as\nuser income changes, item price changes (etc.), change over time. Such dynamics\ncan intrinsically reflect the evolution of users' interests. We argue that\nmodeling such dynamic attributes can boost recommendation performance. However,\nproperly integrating them into user interest models is challenging since\nattribute dynamics can be diverse such as time-interval aware, periodic\npatterns (etc.), and they represent users' behaviors from different\nperspectives, which can happen asynchronously with interactions. Besides\ndynamic attributes, items in each basket contain complex interdependencies\nwhich might be beneficial but nontrivial to effectively capture. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a novel Attentive network to model Dynamic\nattributes (named AnDa). AnDa separately encodes dynamic attributes and basket\nitem sequences. We design a periodic aware encoder to allow the model to\ncapture various temporal patterns from dynamic attributes. To effectively learn\nuseful item relationships, intra-basket attention module is proposed.\nExperimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our method\nconsistently outperforms the state-of-the-art.",

To investigate its computational hardness, we consider three types of\ncomputational frameworks: projection-based algorithms, bispectrum inversion,\nand convex relaxations. We show that a state-of-the-art projection-based\nalgorithm achieves the optimal estimation rate, but its computational\ncomplexity is exponential in the sparsity level. The bispectrum framework\nprovides a statistical-computational trade-off: it requires more observations\n(so its estimation rate is suboptimal), but its computational load is provably\npolynomial in the signal's length.

To meet SLO requirements, the state of\nthe art relies on hardware QoS support (e.g., Intel RDT) to allocate shared\nresources such as last-level caches and memory bandwidth for co-located\nlatency-critical applications. As a result, the number of latency-critical\napplications that can be deployed on a physical machine is bounded by the\nhardware allocation capability. Unfortunately, such hardware capability is very\nlimited.

    "title": "Updating the Theory of Buffer Sizing",
    "abstract": "Routers have packet buffers to reduce packet drops during times of\ncongestion. It is important to correctly size the buffer: make it too small,\nand packets are dropped unnecessarily and the link may be underutilized; make\nit too big, and packets may wait for a long time, and the router itself may be\nmore expensive to build. Despite its importance, there are few guidelines for\npicking the buffer size. The two most well-known rules only apply to long-lived\nTCP Reno flows; either for a network carrying a single TCP Reno flow (the\nbuffer size should equal the bandwidth-delay product, or $BDP$) or for a\nnetwork carrying $n$ TCP Reno flows (the buffer size should equal\n$BDP/\\sqrt{n}$). Since these rules were introduced, TCP Reno has been replaced\nby newer algorithms as the default congestion control algorithm in all major\noperating systems, yet little has been written about how the rules need to\nchange. This paper revisits both rules. For the single flow case, we generalize\nthe $BDP$ rule to account for changes to TCP, such as Proportional Rate\nReduction (PRR), and the introduction of new algorithms including Cubic and\nBBR. We find that buffers can be made 60-75% smaller for newer algorithms. For\nthe multiple flow case, we show that the square root of $n$ rule holds under a\nbroader set of assumptions than previously known, including for these new\ncongestion control algorithms. We also demonstrate situations where the square\nroot of $n$ rule does not hold, including for unfair flows and certain settings\nwith ECN. We validate our results by precisely measuring the time series of\nbuffer occupancy in a real network, and comparing it to the per-packet window\nsize.",

Traditionally, verification\nstrategies are fixed at the beginning of the system's development and\nverification activities are executed as the development progresses. Such an\napproach appears to give inferior results as the selection of the verification\nactivities does not leverage information gained through the system's\ndevelopment process. In contrast, a set-based design approach to verification,\nwhere verification activities are dynamically selected as the system's\ndevelopment progresses, has been shown to provide superior results. However,\nits application under realistic engineering scenarios remains unproven due to\nthe large size of the verification tradespace. In this work, we propose a\nparallel tempering approach (PTA) to efficiently explore the verification\ntradespace.

Second, we design a parallel tempering (PT) algorithm by\nsimulating several replicas of the verification process at different\ntemperatures to obtain a near-optimal result.

    "abstract": "Human pose transfer has typically been modeled as a 2D image-to-image\ntranslation problem. This formulation ignores the human body shape prior in 3D\nspace and inevitably causes implausible artifacts, especially when facing\nocclusion. To address this issue, we propose a lifting-and-projection framework\nto perform pose transfer in the 3D mesh space. The core of our framework is a\nforeground generation module, that consists of two novel networks: a\nlifting-and-projection network (LPNet) and an appearance detail compensating\nnetwork (ADCNet). To leverage the human body shape prior, LPNet exploits the\ntopological information of the body mesh to learn an expressive visual\nrepresentation for the target person in the 3D mesh space. To preserve texture\ndetails, ADCNet is further introduced to enhance the feature produced by LPNet\nwith the source foreground image. Such design of the foreground generation\nmodule enables the model to better handle difficult cases such as those with\nocclusions. Experiments on the iPER and Fashion datasets empirically\ndemonstrate that the proposed lifting-and-projection framework is effective and\noutperforms the existing image-to-image-based and mesh-based methods on human\npose transfer task in both self-transfer and cross-transfer settings.",

However,\nmost methods for measuring human driving styles require thresholds or labels to\nclassify the driving styles, and some require additional questionnaires for\ndrivers about their driving attitude. These limitations are not suitable for\ncreating a large virtual testing environment. Driving models (DMs) simulate\nhuman driving styles. Calibrating a DM makes the simulated driving behavior\ncloser to human-driving behavior, and enable the simulation of human-driving\ncars. Conventional DM-calibrating methods do not take into account that the\nparameters in a DM vary while driving.

This is established by\nstarting with the full-length $[q,k]_q$ Reed-Solomon code over a field $\\mathbb\nF_q$ that is polynomially larger than the desired dimension $k$, and\n\"puncturing\" it by including $k/R$ randomly chosen codeword positions.\nOur puncturing result is more general and applies to any code with large\nminimum distance: we show that a random rate $R$ puncturing of an $\\mathbb\nF_q$-linear \"mother\" code whose relative distance is close enough to $1-1/q$ is\nlist-decodable up to a radius approaching the $q$-ary list-decoding capacity\nbound $h_q^{-1}(1-R)$.

One of major obstacles to hinder the\nsuccessful prediction of molecule property by GNNs is the scarcity of labeled\ndata. Though graph contrastive learning (GCL) methods have achieved\nextraordinary performance with insufficient labeled data, most focused on\ndesigning data augmentation schemes for general graphs. However, the\nfundamental property of a molecule could be altered with the augmentation\nmethod (like random perturbation) on molecular graphs. Whereas, the critical\ngeometric information of molecules remains rarely explored under the current\nGNN and GCL architectures. To this end, we propose a novel graph contrastive\nlearning method utilizing the geometry of the molecule across 2D and 3D views,\nwhich is named GeomGCL. Specifically, we first devise a dual-view geometric\nmessage passing network (GeomMPNN) to adaptively leverage the rich information\nof both 2D and 3D graphs of a molecule. The incorporation of geometric\nproperties at different levels can greatly facilitate the molecular\nrepresentation learning. Then a novel geometric graph contrastive scheme is\ndesigned to make both geometric views collaboratively supervise each other to\nimprove the generalization ability of GeomMPNN. We evaluate GeomGCL on various\ndownstream property prediction tasks via a finetune process. Experimental\nresults on seven real-life molecular datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour proposed GeomGCL against state-of-the-art baselines.",

    "abstract": "Recently, supervised methods, which often require substantial amounts of\nclass labels, have achieved promising results for EEG representation learning.\nHowever, labeling EEG data is a challenging task. More recently, holistic\nsemi-supervised learning approaches, which only require few output labels, have\nshown promising results in the field of computer vision. These methods,\nhowever, have not yet been adapted for EEG learning. In this paper, we adapt\nthree state-of-the-art holistic semi-supervised approaches, namely MixMatch,\nFixMatch, and AdaMatch, as well as five classical semi-supervised methods for\nEEG learning. We perform rigorous experiments with all 8 methods on two public\nEEG-based emotion recognition datasets, namely SEED and SEED-IV. The\nexperiments with different amounts of limited labeled samples show that the\nholistic approaches achieve strong results even when only 1 labeled sample is\nused per class. Further experiments show that in most cases, AdaMatch is the\nmost effective method, followed by MixMatch and FixMatch.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised image-to-image translation aims at learning the mapping from the\nsource to target domain without using paired images for training. An essential\nyet restrictive assumption for unsupervised image translation is that the two\ndomains are aligned, e.g., for the selfie2anime task, the anime (selfie) domain\nmust contain only anime (selfie) face images that can be translated to some\nimages in the other domain.

To solve this problem, we propose to select images based on importance\nreweighting and develop a method to learn the weights and perform translation\nsimultaneously and automatically.

    "abstract": "Conventional information-theoretic quantities assume access to probability\ndistributions. Estimating such distributions is not trivial. Here, we consider\nfunction-based formulations of cross entropy that sidesteps this a priori\nestimation requirement. We propose three measures of R\\'enyi's\n$\\alpha$-cross-entropies in the setting of reproducing-kernel Hilbert spaces.\nEach measure has its appeals. We prove that we can estimate these measures in\nan unbiased, non-parametric, and minimax-optimal way. We do this via\nsample-constructed Gram matrices. This yields matrix-based estimators of\nR\\'enyi's $\\alpha$-cross-entropies. These estimators satisfy all of the axioms\nthat R\\'enyi established for divergences. Our cross-entropies can thus be used\nfor assessing distributional differences. They are also appropriate for\nhandling high-dimensional distributions, since the convergence rate of our\nestimator is independent of the sample dimensionality.\nPython code for implementing these measures can be found at\nhttps://github.com/isledge/MBRCE",

While several strategies for protecting against\nside-channel attacks exist, these often fail in practice due to unintended\ninteractions between values deep within the CPU. To detect and protect from\nside-channel attacks, several automated tools have recently been proposed; one\nof their common limitations is that they only support first-order leakage.\nIn this work, we present the first automated tool for detecting and\neliminating higher-order leakage from cryptographic implementations. Rosita++\nproposes statistical and software-based tools to allow high-performance\nhigher-order leakage detection. It then uses the code rewrite engine of Rosita\n(Shelton et al. NDSS 2021) to eliminate detected leakage. For the sake of\npracticality we evaluate Rosita++ against second and third order leakage, but\nour framework is not restricted to only these orders.\nWe evaluate Rosita++ against second-order leakage with three-share\nimplementations of two ciphers, PRESENT and Xoodoo, and with the second-order\nBoolean-to-arithmetic masking, a core building block of masked implementations\nof many cryptographic primitives, including SHA-2, ChaCha and Blake. We show\neffective second-order leakage elimination at a performance cost of 36% for\nXoodoo, 189% for PRESENT, and 29% for the Boolean-to-arithmetic masking. For\nthird-order analysis, we evaluate Rosita++ against the third-order leakage\nusing a four-share synthetic example that corresponds to typical four-share\nprocessing.

Unraveling the function\nof such architectures is highly challenging; they contain massive diversity and\nheterogeneity in components and cryptic internal feedback pathways (IFPs). We\nintroduce the key concepts of speed-accuracy tradeoffs (SATs),\ndiversity-enabled sweet spots (DESS), and controller architecture which aim to\nhelp decipher complex neural architecture. As a case study in diversity and\ncomplex architectures, we consider nervous system control of movement. In this\nsystem, diversity in sensors corresponds to diverse morphology, physiology, and\nbiochemistry of neurons. which can be interpreted as SATs in component\nspecification. While such tradeoffs are often implicit in controller design, we\naim here to make them explicit in the canonical LQR setting. We consider an LQR\nproblem with two types of sensors, one fast but sparse and one dense but slow.\nThe sensors achieved substantially lower performance costs when combined than\nwhen separate, demonstrating a DESS. The DeSS is also observed for the dual\nproblem in actuation, corresponding to diverse muscle fibers.\nController-internal dynamics, sometimes called internal feedback pathways\n(IFPs) in biology, were necessary to achieve these combinations.

    "abstract": "Judging the quality of samples synthesized by generative models can be\ntedious and time consuming, especially for complex data structures, such as\npoint clouds. This paper presents a novel approach to quantify the realism of\nlocal regions in LiDAR point clouds. Relevant features are learned from\nreal-world and synthetic point clouds by training on a proxy classification\ntask. Inspired by fair networks, we use an adversarial technique to discourage\nthe encoding of dataset-specific information. The resulting metric can assign a\nquality score to samples without requiring any task specific annotations.\nIn a series of experiments, we confirm the soundness of our metric by\napplying it in controllable task setups and on unseen data. Additional\nexperiments show reliable interpolation capabilities of the metric between data\nwith varying degree of realism. As one important application, we demonstrate\nhow the local realism score can be used for anomaly detection in point clouds.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of efficiently charging a set of rechargeable nodes\nusing a set of wireless chargers, under safety constraints on the\nelectromagnetic radiation incurred. In particular, we define a new charging\nmodel that greatly differs from existing models in that it takes into account\nreal technology restrictions of the chargers and nodes of the network, mainly\nregarding energy limitations. Our model also introduces non-linear constraints\n(in the time domain), that radically change the nature of the computational\nproblems we consider. In this charging model, we present and study the Low\nRadiation Efficient Charging Problem (LREC), in which we wish to optimize the\namount of \"useful\" energy transferred from chargers to nodes (under constraints\non the maximum level of imposed radiation). We present several fundamental\nproperties of this problem and provide indications of its hardness. Finally, we\npropose an iterative local improvement heuristic for LREC, which runs in\npolynomial time and we evaluate its performance via simulation. Our algorithm\ndecouples the computation of the objective function from the computation of the\nmaximum radiation and also does not depend on the exact formula used for the\ncomputation of the electromagnetic radiation in each point of the network,\nachieving good trade-offs between charging efficiency and radiation control; it\nalso exhibits good energy balance properties.

    "abstract": "Inspired by the success of BERT, several multimodal representation learning\napproaches have been proposed that jointly represent image and text. These\napproaches achieve superior performance by capturing high-level semantic\ninformation from large-scale multimodal pretraining. In particular, LXMERT and\nUNITER adopt visual region feature regression and label classification as\npretext tasks. However, they tend to suffer from the problems of noisy labels\nand sparse semantic annotations, based on the visual features having been\npretrained on a crowdsourced dataset with limited and inconsistent semantic\nlabeling. To overcome these issues, we propose unbiased Dense Contrastive\nVisual-Linguistic Pretraining (DCVLP), which replaces the region regression and\nclassification with cross-modality region contrastive learning that requires no\nannotations. Two data augmentation strategies (Mask Perturbation and\nIntra-/Inter-Adversarial Perturbation) are developed to improve the quality of\nnegative samples used in contrastive learning. Overall, DCVLP allows\ncross-modality dense region contrastive learning in a self-supervised setting\nindependent of any object annotations. We compare our method against prior\nvisual-linguistic pretraining frameworks to validate the superiority of dense\ncontrastive learning on multimodal representation learning.",

In this work, we study generalization in Bayesian RL\nunder the probably approximately correct (PAC) framework, using the method of\nalgorithmic stability. Our main contribution is showing that by adding\nregularization, the optimal policy becomes stable in an appropriate sense. Most\nstability results in the literature build on strong convexity of the\nregularized loss -- an approach that is not suitable for RL as Markov decision\nprocesses (MDPs) are not convex. Instead, building on recent results of fast\nconvergence rates for mirror descent in regularized MDPs, we show that\nregularized MDPs satisfy a certain quadratic growth criterion, which is\nsufficient to establish stability.

Specifically, given an unseen triple (h, r, t), a\ntrained model can still correctly predict t from (h, r, ?), or h from (?, r,\nt), such extrapolation ability is impressive. However, most existing KGE works\nfocus on the design of delicate triple modeling function, which mainly tell us\nhow to measure the plausibility of observed triples, but we have limited\nunderstanding of why the methods can extrapolate to unseen data, and what are\nthe important factors to help KGE extrapolate. Therefore in this work, we\nattempt to, from a data relevant view, study KGE extrapolation of two problems:\n1. How does KGE extrapolate to unseen data? 2. How to design the KGE model with\nbetter extrapolation ability? For the problem 1, we first discuss the impact\nfactors for extrapolation and from relation, entity and triple level\nrespectively, propose three Semantic Evidences (SEs), which can be observed\nfrom training set and provide important semantic information for extrapolation\nto unseen data. Then we verify the effectiveness of SEs through extensive\nexperiments on several typical KGE methods, and demonstrate that SEs serve as\nan important role for understanding the extrapolation ability of KGE. For the\nproblem 2, to make better use of the SE information for more extrapolative\nknowledge representation, we propose a novel GNN-based KGE model, called\nSemantic Evidence aware Graph Neural Network (SE-GNN).

They provide a concise way\nto express protocol specifications and a lightweight approach for checking\ntheir implementation. Current solutions are based on only implicit\nsynchronization, and are based on the less precise types rather than logical\nformulae. In this paper, we propose a more expressive session logic to capture\nmultiparty protocols. By using two kinds of ordering constraints, namely\n\"happens-before\" <HB and \"communicates-before\" <CB, we show how to ensure from\nfirst principle race-freedom over common channels. Our approach refines each\nspecification with both assumptions and proof obligations to ensure compliance\nto some global protocol. Each specification is then projected for each party\nand then each channel, to allow cooperative proving through localized automated\nverification. Our primary goal in automated verification is to ensure\nrace-freedom and communication-safety, but the approach is extensible for\ndeadlock-freedom as well.

    "abstract": "The vulnerability of machine learning models to adversarial perturbations has\nmotivated a significant amount of research under the broad umbrella of\nadversarial machine learning. Sophisticated attacks may cause learning\nalgorithms to learn decision functions or make decisions with poor predictive\nperformance. In this context, there is a growing body of literature that uses\nlocal intrinsic dimensionality (LID), a local metric that describes the minimum\nnumber of latent variables required to describe each data point, for detecting\nadversarial samples and subsequently mitigating their effects. The research to\ndate has tended to focus on using LID as a practical defence method often\nwithout fully explaining why LID can detect adversarial samples. In this paper,\nwe derive a lower-bound and an upper-bound for the LID value of a perturbed\ndata point and demonstrate that the bounds, in particular the lower-bound, has\na positive correlation with the magnitude of the perturbation. Hence, we\ndemonstrate that data points that are perturbed by a large amount would have\nlarge LID values compared to unperturbed samples, thus justifying its use in\nthe prior literature. Furthermore, our empirical validation demonstrates the\nvalidity of the bounds on benchmark datasets.",

We give a first-principles derivation of a\ngeneral-purpose dynamic programming algorithm that returns a sequence of\ninformative measurements by sequentially maximizing the entropy of possible\nmeasurement outcomes. This algorithm can be used by an autonomous agent or\nrobot to decide where best to measure next, planning a path corresponding to an\noptimal sequence of informative measurements. This algorithm is applicable to\nstates and controls that are continuous or discrete, and agent dynamics that is\neither stochastic or deterministic; including Markov decision processes. Recent\nresults from approximate dynamic programming and reinforcement learning,\nincluding on-line approximations such as rollout and Monte Carlo tree search,\nallow an agent or robot to solve the measurement task in real-time. The\nresulting near-optimal solutions include non-myopic paths and measurement\nsequences that can generally outperform, sometimes substantially, commonly-used\ngreedy heuristics such as maximizing the entropy of each measurement outcome.\nThis is demonstrated for a global search problem, where on-line planning with\nan extended local search is found to reduce the number of measurements in the\nsearch by half.",

A common way to organize such a collaboration is\nthe use of technology roadmaps, which act as an industry-wide long-term\nplanning tool. Technology roadmaps are used to identify industry needs,\nestimate the availability of technological solutions, and identify the need for\ninnovation in the future. Roadmaps are inherently both time-dependent and based\non uncertain values, i.e., properties and structural components can change over\ntime. Furthermore, roadmaps have to reason about alternative solutions as well\nas their key performance indicators. Current approaches for model-based\nengineering do not inherently support these aspects.\nWe present a novel model-based approach treating those aspects as first-class\ncitizens.

To address this issue, we propose a new pooling method that is\nshift-equivalent and anti-aliasing, named frequency pooling. Frequency pooling\nfirst transforms the features into the frequency domain, and then removes the\nfrequency components beyond the Nyquist frequency.

The $k$-center problem with\noutliers is defined similarly, except that $z$ of the points in $P$ do need not\nto be covered, for a given parameter $z$. We study the $k$-center problem with\noutliers in data streams in the sliding-window model. In this model we are\ngiven a possibly infinite stream $P=\\langle p_1,p_2,p_3,\\ldots\\rangle$ of\npoints and a time window of length $W$, and we want to maintain a small sketch\nof the set $P(t)$ of points currently in the window such that using the sketch\nwe can approximately solve the problem on $P(t)$.\nWe present the first algorithm for the $k$-center problem with outliers in\nthe sliding-window model. The algorithm works for the case where the points\ncome from a space of bounded doubling dimension and it maintains a set $S(t)$\nsuch that an optimal solution on $S(t)$ gives a $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximate\nsolution on $P(t)$. The algorithm is deterministic and uses\n$O((kz/\\varepsilon^d)\\log \\sigma)$ storage, where $d$ is the doubling dimension\nof the underlying space and $\\sigma$ is the spread of the points in the stream.\nAlgorithms providing a $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximation were not even known in\nthe setting without outliers or in the insertion-only setting with outliers. We\nalso present a lower bound showing that any algorithm that provides a\n$(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximation must use $\\Omega((kz/\\varepsilon)\\log \\sigma)$\nstorage.",

    "title": "Dynamic Data Structures for $k$-Nearest Neighbor Queries",
    "abstract": "Our aim is to develop dynamic data structures that support $k$-nearest\nneighbors ($k$-NN) queries for a set of $n$ point sites in $O(f(n) + k)$ time,\nwhere $f(n)$ is some polylogarithmic function of $n$. The key component is a\ngeneral query algorithm that allows us to find the $k$-NN spread over $t$\nsubstructures simultaneously, thus reducing a $O(tk)$ term in the query time to\n$O(k)$. Combining this technique with the logarithmic method allows us to turn\nany static $k$-NN data structure into a data structure supporting both\nefficient insertions and queries. For the fully dynamic case, this technique\nallows us to recover the deterministic, worst-case, $O(\\log^2n/\\log\\log n +k)$\nquery time for the Euclidean distance claimed before, while preserving the\npolylogarithmic update times. We adapt this data structure to also support\nfully dynamic \\emph{geodesic} $k$-NN queries among a set of sites in a simple\npolygon. For this purpose, we design a shallow cutting based, deletion-only\n$k$-NN data structure. More generally, we obtain a dynamic $k$-NN data\nstructure for any type of distance functions for which we can build vertical\nshallow cuttings. We apply all of our methods in the plane for the Euclidean\ndistance, the geodesic distance, and general, constant-complexity, algebraic\ndistance functions.",

    "title": "The Max-Line-Formation Problem",
    "abstract": "We consider n robots with limited visibility: each robot can observe other\nrobots only up to a constant distance denoted as the viewing range. The robots\noperate in discrete rounds that are either fully synchronous (FSync) or\nsemi-synchronized (SSync). Most previously studied formation problems in this\nsetting seek to bring the robots closer together (e.g., Gathering or\nChain-Formation). In this work, we introduce the Max-Line-Formation problem,\nwhich has a contrary goal: to arrange the robots on a straight line of maximal\nlength. First, we prove that the problem is impossible to solve by robots with\na constant sized circular viewing range. The impossibility holds under\ncomparably strong assumptions: robots that agree on both axes of their local\ncoordinate systems in FSync. On the positive side, we show that the problem is\nsolvable by robots with a constant square viewing range, i.e., the robots can\nobserve other robots that lie within a constant-sized square centered at their\nposition. In this case, the robots need to agree on only one axis of their\nlocal coordinate systems. We derive two algorithms: the first algorithm\nconsiders oblivious robots and converges to the optimal configuration in time\n$\\mathcal{O}(n^2 \\cdot \\log (n/\\varepsilon))$ under the SSync scheduler. The\nother algorithm makes use of locally visible lights (LUMI). It is designed for\nthe FSync scheduler and can solve the problem exactly in optimal time\n$\\Theta(n)$. Afterward, we show that both the algorithmic and the analysis\ntechniques can also be applied to the Gathering and Chain-Formation problem: we\nintroduce an algorithm with a reduced viewing range for Gathering and give new\nand improved runtime bounds for the Chain-Formation problem.",

In\nthis paper, we start from studying the f-divergence between learning policy and\nsampling policy and derive a novel DRL framework, termed f-Divergence\nReinforcement Learning (FRL). We highlight that the policy evaluation and\npolicy improvement phases are induced by minimizing f-divergence between\nlearning policy and sampling policy, which is distinct from the conventional\nDRL algorithm objective that maximizes the expected cumulative rewards.\nBesides, we convert this framework to a saddle-point optimization problem with\na specific f function through Fenchel conjugate, which consists of policy\nevaluation and policy improvement. Then we derive new policy evaluation and\npolicy improvement methods in FRL. Our framework may give new insights for\nanalyzing DRL algorithms. The FRL framework achieves two advantages: (1) policy\nevaluation and policy improvement processes are derived simultaneously by\nf-divergence; (2) overestimation issue of value function are alleviated. To\nevaluate the effectiveness of the FRL framework, we conduct experiments on\nAtari 2600 video games, which show that our framework matches or surpasses the\nDRL algorithms we tested.",

    "abstract": "The micro-segmentation of customers in the finance sector is a non-trivial\ntask and has been an atypical omission from recent scientific literature. Where\ntraditional segmentation classifies customers based on coarse features such as\ndemographics, micro-segmentation depicts more nuanced differences between\nindividuals, bringing forth several advantages including the potential for\nimproved personalization in financial services. AI and representation learning\noffer a unique opportunity to solve the problem of micro-segmentation. Although\nubiquitous in many industries, the proliferation of AI in sensitive industries\nsuch as finance has become contingent on the imperatives of responsible AI. We\nhad previously solved the micro-segmentation problem by extracting temporal\nfeatures from the state space of a recurrent neural network (RNN). However, due\nto the inherent opacity of RNNs our solution lacked an explanation - one of the\nimperatives of responsible AI. In this study, we address this issue by\nextracting an explanation for and providing an interpretation of our temporal\nfeatures. We investigate the state space of our RNN and through a linear\nregression model reconstruct the trajectories in the state space with high\nfidelity. We show that our linear regression coefficients have not only learned\nthe rules used to create the RNN's output data but have also learned the\nrelationships that were not directly evident in the raw data.",

    "abstract": "In light of a reliable and resilient power system under extreme weather and\nnatural disasters, networked microgrids integrating local renewable resources\nhave been adopted extensively to supply demands when the main utility\nexperiences blackouts. However, the stochastic nature of renewables and\nunpredictable contingencies are difficult to address with the deterministic\nenergy management framework. The paper proposes a comprehensive\ndistributionally robust joint chance-constrained (DR-JCC) framework that\nincorporates microgrid island, power flow, distributed batteries and voltage\ncontrol constraints. All chance constraints are solved jointly and each one is\nassigned to an optimized violation rate. To highlight, the JCC problem with the\noptimized violation rates has been recognized to be NP-hard and challenging to\nbe solved. This paper proposes a novel evolutionary algorithm that successfully\ntackles the problem and reduces the solution conservativeness (i.e. operation\ncost) by around 50% comparing with the baseline Bonferroni Approximation.\nConsidering the imperfect solar power forecast, we construct three data-driven\nambiguity sets to model uncertain forecast error distributions. The solution is\nthus robust for any distribution in sets with the shared moment and shape\nassumptions. The proposed method is validated by robustness tests based on\nthose sets and firmly secures the solution robustness.",

    "abstract": "Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has recently emerged as an\neffective waveform to tackle the linear time-varying channels. In OTFS\nliterature, approximately constant channel gains for every group of samples\nwithin each OTFS block are assumed. This leads to limitations for OTFS on the\nmaximum Doppler frequency that it can tolerate. Additionally, presence of\ncyclic prefix (CP) in OTFS signal limits the flexibility in adjusting its\nparameters to improve its robustness against channel time variations.\nTherefore, in this paper, we study the possibility of removing the CP overhead\nfrom OTFS and breaking its Doppler limitations through multiple antenna\nprocessing in the large antenna regime. We asymptotically analyze the\nperformance of time-reversal maximum ratio combining (TR-MRC) for OTFS without\nCP. We show that doubly dispersive channel effects average out in the large\nantenna regime when the maximum Doppler shift is within OTFS limitations.\nHowever, for considerably large Doppler shifts exceeding OTFS limitations, a\nresidual Doppler effect remains. Our asymptotic derivations reveal that this\neffect converges to scaling of the received symbols in delay dimension with the\nsamples of a Bessel function that depends on the maximum Doppler shift. Hence,\nwe propose a novel residual Doppler correction (RDC) windowing technique that\ncan break the Doppler limitations of OTFS and lead to a performance close to\nthat of the linear time-invariant channels. Finally, we confirm the validity of\nour claims through simulations.",

In this paper, we introduce anew bug\nlocalization approach, called Broccoli, which uses techniques from previous\napproaches and extends them with a search engine to improve the localization.\nPrimarily, we utilize a search engine to find similar source code locations and\nprior bug reports that are comparable to the new bug report. We combine these\nsearch engine techniques with information retrieval techniques used by previous\napproaches.

    "abstract": "Predicting the next interaction of a short-term sequence is a challenging\ntask in session-based recommendation (SBR).Multi-behavior session\nrecommendation considers session sequence with multiple interaction types, such\nas click and purchase, to capture more effective user intention representation\nsufficiently.Despite the superior performance of existing multi-behavior based\nmethods for SBR, there are still several severe limitations:(i) Almost all\nexisting works concentrate on single target type of next behavior and fail to\nmodel multiplex behavior sessions uniformly.(ii) Previous methods also ignore\nthe semantic relations between various next behavior and historical behavior\nsequence, which are significant signals to obtain current latent intention for\nSBR.(iii) The global cross-session item-item graph established by some existing\nmodels may incorporate semantics and context level noise for multi-behavior\nsession-based recommendation. To overcome the limitations (i) and (ii), we\npropose two novel tasks for SBR, which require the incorporation of both\nhistorical behaviors and next behaviors into unified multi-behavior\nrecommendation modeling. To this end, we design a Multi-behavior Graph\nContextual Aware Network (MGCNet) for multi-behavior session-based\nrecommendation for the two proposed tasks. Specifically, we build a\nmulti-behavior global item transition graph based on all sessions involving all\ninteraction types. Based on the global graph, MGCNet attaches the global\ninterest representation to final item representation based on local contextual\nintention to address the limitation (iii). In the end, we utilize the next\nbehavior information explicitly to guide the learning of general interest and\ncurrent intention for SBR. Experiments on three public benchmark datasets show\nthat MGCNet can outperform state-of-the-art models for multi-behavior\nsession-based recommendation.",

This is\ndemonstrated by the growing number of new iterations proposed for increasingly\ncomplex problems, ranging from multi-layer inference to low-rank matrix\nestimation with elaborate priors. In this paper, we address the following\nquestions: is there a structure underlying all AMP iterations that unifies them\nin a common framework? Can we use such a structure to give a modular proof of\nstate evolution equations, adaptable to new AMP iterations without reproducing\neach time the full argument ? We propose an answer to both questions, showing\nthat AMP instances can be generically indexed by an oriented graph. This\nenables to give a unified interpretation of these iterations, independent from\nthe problem they solve, and a way of composing them arbitrarily. We then show\nthat all AMP iterations indexed by such a graph admit rigorous SE equations,\nextending the reach of previous proofs, and proving a number of recent\nheuristic derivations of those equations.

We introduce a novel modulated rotation\nloss to alleviate the problem and propose a rotation sensitivity detection\nnetwork (RSDet) which is consists of an eight-param single-stage rotated object\ndetector and the modulated rotation loss.

    "abstract": "Developers are increasingly using services such as Dependabot to automate\ndependency updates. However, recent research has shown that developers perceive\nsuch services as unreliable, as they heavily rely on test coverage to detect\nconflicts in updates. To understand the prevalence of tests exercising\ndependencies, we calculate the test coverage of direct and indirect uses of\ndependencies in 521 well-tested Java projects. We find that tests only cover\n58% of direct and 20% of transitive dependency calls. By creating 1,122,420\nartificial updates with simple faults covering all dependency usages in 262\nprojects, we measure the effectiveness of test suites in detecting semantic\nfaults in dependencies; we find that tests can only detect 47% of direct and\n35% of indirect artificial faults on average. To increase reliability, we\ninvestigate the use of change impact analysis as a means of reducing false\nnegatives; on average, our tool can uncover 74% of injected faults in direct\ndependencies and 64% for transitive dependencies, nearly two times more than\ntest suites. We then apply our tool in 22 real-world dependency updates, where\nit identifies three semantically conflicting cases and five cases of unused\ndependencies.

    "abstract": "Accurately segmenting teeth and identifying the corresponding anatomical\nlandmarks on dental mesh models are essential in computer-aided orthodontic\ntreatment. Manually performing these two tasks is time-consuming, tedious, and,\nmore importantly, highly dependent on orthodontists' experiences due to the\nabnormality and large-scale variance of patients' teeth. Some machine\nlearning-based methods have been designed and applied in the orthodontic field\nto automatically segment dental meshes (e.g., intraoral scans). In contrast,\nthe number of studies on tooth landmark localization is still limited. This\npaper proposes a two-stage framework based on mesh deep learning (called\nTS-MDL) for joint tooth labeling and landmark identification on raw intraoral\nscans. Our TS-MDL first adopts an end-to-end \\emph{i}MeshSegNet method (i.e., a\nvariant of the existing MeshSegNet with both improved accuracy and efficiency)\nto label each tooth on the downsampled scan. Guided by the segmentation\noutputs, our TS-MDL further selects each tooth's region of interest (ROI) on\nthe original mesh to construct a light-weight variant of the pioneering\nPointNet (i.e., PointNet-Reg) for regressing the corresponding landmark\nheatmaps. Our TS-MDL was evaluated on a real-clinical dataset, showing\npromising segmentation and localization performance. Specifically,\n\\emph{i}MeshSegNet in the first stage of TS-MDL reached an averaged Dice\nsimilarity coefficient (DSC) at $0.953\\pm0.076$, significantly outperforming\nthe original MeshSegNet. In the second stage, PointNet-Reg achieved a mean\nabsolute error (MAE) of $0.623\\pm0.718 \\, mm$ in distances between the\nprediction and ground truth for $44$ landmarks, which is superior compared with\nother networks for landmark detection. All these results suggest the potential\nusage of our TS-MDL in clinical practices.",

    "abstract": "In future IoT environments it is expected that the role of personal devices\nof mobile users in the physical area where IoT devices are deployed will become\nmore and more important. In particular, due to the push towards\ndecentralisation of services towards the edge, it is likely that a significant\nshare of data generated by IoT devices will be needed by other (mobile) nodes\nnearby, while global Internet access will be limited only to a small fraction\nof data. In this context, opportunistic networking schemes can be adopted to\nbuild efficient content-centric protocols, through which data generated by IoT\ndevices (or by mobile nodes themselves) can be accessed by the other nodes\nnearby. In this paper, we propose MobCCN, which is an ICN-compliant protocol\nfor this heterogeneous environment. MobCCN is designed to implement the routing\nand forwarding mechanisms of the main ICN realisations, such as CCN. The\noriginal aspect of MobCCN is to implement an efficient opportunistic networking\nrouting scheme to populate the Forwarding Interest Base (FIB) tables of the\nnodes, in order to guide the propagation of Interest packets towards nodes that\nstore the required data. Specifically, MobCCN defines the utility of each node\nas a forwarder of Interest packets for a certain type of content, such that\nInterest packets can be propagated along a positive utility gradient, until\nreaching some node storing the data. We evaluate MobCCN against protocols\nrepresenting two possible endpoints of the spectrum, respectively in terms of\nminimising the data delivery delay and the resource consumption. Performance\nresults show that MobCCN is very effective and efficient, as it guarantees very\nhigh delivery rates and low delays, while keeping the total generated traffic\nat a reasonable level and also saving local resources.",

    "abstract": "The quest for a brain-inspired learning algorithm for robots has culminated\nin the free energy principle from neuroscience that models the brain's\nperception and action as an optimization over its free energy objectives. Based\non this idea, we propose an estimation algorithm for accurate output prediction\nof a quadrotor flying under unmodelled wind conditions. The key idea behind\nthis work is the handling of unmodelled wind dynamics and the model's\nnon-linearity errors as coloured noise in the system, and leveraging it for\naccurate output predictions. This paper provides the first experimental\nvalidation for the usefulness of generalized coordinates for robot perception\nusing Dynamic Expectation Maximization (DEM). Through real flight experiments,\nwe show that the estimator outperforms classical estimators with the least\nerror in output predictions. Based on the experimental results, we extend the\nDEM algorithm for model order selection for complete black box identification.\nWith this paper, we provide the first experimental validation of DEM applied to\nrobot learning.",

    "abstract": "Past research has proposed numerous hardware prefetching techniques, most of\nwhich rely on exploiting one specific type of program context information\n(e.g., program counter, cacheline address) to predict future memory accesses.\nThese techniques either completely neglect a prefetcher's undesirable effects\n(e.g., memory bandwidth usage) on the overall system, or incorporate\nsystem-level feedback as an afterthought to a system-unaware prefetch\nalgorithm. We show that prior prefetchers often lose their performance benefit\nover a wide range of workloads and system configurations due to their inherent\ninability to take multiple different types of program context and system-level\nfeedback information into account while prefetching. In this paper, we make a\ncase for designing a holistic prefetch algorithm that learns to prefetch using\nmultiple different types of program context and system-level feedback\ninformation inherent to its design.\nTo this end, we propose Pythia, which formulates the prefetcher as a\nreinforcement learning agent. For every demand request, Pythia observes\nmultiple different types of program context information to make a prefetch\ndecision. For every prefetch decision, Pythia receives a numerical reward that\nevaluates prefetch quality under the current memory bandwidth usage. Pythia\nuses this reward to reinforce the correlation between program context\ninformation and prefetch decision to generate highly accurate, timely, and\nsystem-aware prefetch requests in the future. Our extensive evaluations using\nsimulation and hardware synthesis show that Pythia outperforms multiple\nstate-of-the-art prefetchers over a wide range of workloads and system\nconfigurations, while incurring only 1.03% area overhead over a desktop-class\nprocessor and no software changes in workloads.

    "title": "Toward Efficient and Robust Multiple Camera Visual-inertial Odometry",
    "abstract": "Efficiency and robustness are the essential criteria for the visual-inertial\nodometry (VIO) system. To process massive visual data, the high cost on CPU\nresources and computation latency limits VIO's possibility in integration with\nother applications. Recently, the powerful embedded GPUs have great potentials\nto improve the front-end image processing capability. Meanwhile, multi-camera\nsystems can increase the visual constraints for back-end optimization. Inspired\nby these insights, we incorporate the GPU-enhanced algorithms in the field of\nVIO and thus propose a new front-end with NVIDIA Vision Programming Interface\n(VPI). This new front-end then enables multi-camera VIO feature association and\nprovides more stable back-end pose optimization. Experiments with our new\nfront-end on monocular datasets show the CPU resource occupation rate and\ncomputational latency are reduced by 40.4% and 50.6% without losing accuracy\ncompared with the original VIO. The multi-camera system shows a higher VIO\ninitialization success rate and better robustness overall state estimation.",

    "abstract": "This letter presents the design and development of a robotic system to give\nphysical assistance to the elderly or people with neurological disorders such\nas Ataxia or Parkinson's. In particular, we propose using a mobile\ncollaborative robot with an interaction-assistive whole-body interface to help\npeople unable to maintain balance. The robotic system consists of an\nOmni-directional mobile base, a high-payload robotic arm, and an\nadmittance-type interface acting as a support handle while measuring\nhuman-sourced interaction forces. The postural balance of the human body is\nestimated through the projection of the body Center of Mass (CoM) to the\nsupport polygon (SP) representing the quasi-static Center of Pressure (CoP). In\nresponse to the interaction forces and the tracking of the human posture, the\nrobot can create assistive forces to restore balance in case of its loss.\nOtherwise, during normal stance or walking, it will follow the user with\nminimum/no opposing forces through the generation of coupled arm and base\nmovements. As the balance-restoring strategy, we propose two strategies and\nevaluate them in a laboratory setting on healthy human participants.\nQuantitative and qualitative results of a 12-subjects experiment are then\nillustrated and discussed, comparing the performances of the two strategies and\nthe overall system.",

    "title": "Simultaneous Matrix Orderings for Graph Collections",
    "abstract": "Undirected graphs are frequently used to model networks. The topology of an\nundirected graph G can be captured by an adjacency matrix; this matrix in turn\ncan be visualized directly to give insight into the graph structure. Which\nvisual patterns appear in such a matrix visualization depends on the ordering\nof its rows and columns. Formally defining the quality of an ordering and then\nautomatically computing a high-quality ordering are both challenging problems;\nhowever, effective heuristics exist and are used in practice.\nOften, graphs exist as part of a collection of graphs on the same set of\nvertices. To visualize such graph collections, we need a single ordering that\nworks well for all matrices simultaneously. The current state-of-the-art solves\nthis problem by taking a (weighted) union over all graphs and applying existing\nheuristics. However, this union leads to a loss of information, specifically in\nthose parts of the graphs which are different. We propose a collection-aware\napproach to avoid this loss of information and apply it to two popular\nheuristic methods: leaf order and barycenter.\nThe de-facto standard computational quality metrics for matrix ordering\ncapture only block-diagonal patterns (cliques). Instead, we propose to use\nMoran's I, a spatial auto-correlation metric, which captures the full range of\nestablished patterns. The popular leaf order method heuristically optimizes a\nsimilar measure which supports the use of Moran's I in this context.\nWe evaluated our methods for simultaneous orderings on real-world datasets\nusing Moran's I as the quality metric. Our results show that our\ncollection-aware approach matches or improves performance compared to the union\napproach, depending on the similarity of the graphs in the collection.\nSpecifically, our Moran's I-based collection-aware leaf order implementation\nconsistently outperforms other implementations.",

    "abstract": "Human-swarm interaction has recently gained attention due to its plethora of\nnew applications in disaster relief, surveillance, rescue, and exploration.\nHowever, if the task difficulty increases, the performance of the human\noperator decreases, thereby decreasing the overall efficacy of the human-swarm\nteam. Thus, it is critical to identify the task difficulty and adaptively\nallocate the task to the human operator to maintain optimal performance. In\nthis direction, we study the classification of task difficulty in a human-swarm\ninteraction experiment performing a target search mission. The human may\ncontrol platoons of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground\nvehicles (UGVs) to search a partially observable environment during the target\nsearch mission. The mission complexity is increased by introducing adversarial\nteams that humans may only see when the environment is explored. While the\nhuman is completing the mission, their brain activity is recorded using an\nelectroencephalogram (EEG), which is used to classify the task difficulty. We\nhave used two different approaches for classification: A feature-based approach\nusing coherence values as input and a deep learning-based approach using raw\nEEG as input. Both approaches can classify the task difficulty well above the\nchance. The results showed the importance of the occipital lobe (O1 and O2)\ncoherence feature with the other brain regions. Moreover, we also study\nindividual differences (expert vs. novice) in the classification results.

    "abstract": "In an emergency room (ER) setting, the diagnosis of stroke is a common\nchallenge. Due to excessive execution time and cost, an MRI scan is usually not\navailable in the ER. Clinical tests are commonly referred to in stroke\nscreening, but neurologists may not be immediately available. We propose a\nnovel multimodal deep learning framework, DeepStroke, to achieve computer-aided\nstroke presence assessment by recognizing the patterns of facial motion\nincoordination and speech inability for patients with suspicion of stroke in an\nacute setting. Our proposed DeepStroke takes video data for local facial\nparalysis detection and audio data for global speech disorder analysis. It\nfurther leverages a multi-modal lateral fusion to combine the low- and\nhigh-level features and provides mutual regularization for joint training. A\nnovel adversarial training loss is also introduced to obtain\nidentity-independent and stroke-discriminative features. Experiments on our\nvideo-audio dataset with actual ER patients show that the proposed approach\noutperforms state-of-the-art models and achieves better performance than ER\ndoctors, attaining a 6.60% higher sensitivity and maintaining 4.62% higher\naccuracy when specificity is aligned. Meanwhile, each assessment can be\ncompleted in less than 6 minutes, demonstrating the framework's great potential\nfor clinical implementation.",

    "abstract": "To build increasingly general-purpose artificial intelligence systems that\ncan deal with unknown variables across unknown domains, we need benchmarks that\nmeasure precisely how well these systems perform on tasks they have never seen\nbefore. A prerequisite for this is a measure of a task's generalization\ndifficulty, or how dissimilar it is from the system's prior knowledge and\nexperience. If the skill of an intelligence system in a particular domain is\ndefined as it's ability to consistently generate a set of instructions (or\nprograms) to solve tasks in that domain, current benchmarks do not\nquantitatively measure the efficiency of acquiring new skills, making it\npossible to brute-force skill acquisition by training with unlimited amounts of\ndata and compute power. With this in mind, we first propose a common language\nof instruction, i.e. a programming language that allows the expression of\nprograms in the form of directed acyclic graphs across a wide variety of\nreal-world domains and computing platforms. Using programs generated in this\nlanguage, we demonstrate a match-based method to both score performance and\ncalculate the generalization difficulty of any given set of tasks. We use these\nto define a numeric benchmark called the g-index to measure and compare the\nskill-acquisition efficiency of any intelligence system on a set of real-world\ntasks. Finally, we evaluate the suitability of some well-known models as\ngeneral intelligence systems by calculating their g-index scores.",

    "abstract": "Background: Type-4 clones refer to a pair of code snippets with similar\nfunctionality but written in different syntax, which challenges the existing\ncode clone detection techniques. Previous studies, however, highly rely on\nsyntactic structures and textual tokens, which cannot precisely represent the\nsemantic information of code and might introduce nonnegligible noise into the\ndetection models. Aims: To overcome these limitations, we explore an effective\nsemantic-based solution for Type-4 clone detection. Additionally, we conducted\nan empirical study on the characteristics of Type-4 clone pairs. We found that\nNOT all tokens contain semantics that the Type-4 clone detection required.\nOperators and API calls emerge as distinct candidates for Type-4 code semantic\nrepresentation. Method: To bridge this gap, we design a novel semantic graph\nbased deep detection approach, called SEED. For a pair of code snippets, SEED\nconstructs a semantic graph of each code snippet based on intermediate\nrepresentation to represent the code functionality more precisely compared to\nthe representations based on lexical and syntactic analysis. To accommodate the\ncharacteristics of Type-4 clones, a semantic graph is constructed focusing on\nthe operators and API calls instead of all tokens. Then, SEED generates the\nfeature vectors by using the graph deep neural network and performs code clone\ndetection based on the similarity among the vectors. Results: Extensive\nexperiments show that our approach significantly outperforms two baseline\napproaches over two public datasets and one customized dataset. Specially, SEED\noutperforms other baseline methods by an average of 25.2% in the form of\nF1-Score. Conclusions: Our experiments demonstrate that SEED can reach\nstate-of-the-art and be useful for Type-4 clone detection in practice.",

Recent works in\nmanipulation have shown that end-to-end networks can learn dexterous skills\nthat require precise spatial reasoning, but these methods often fail to\ngeneralize to new goals or quickly learn transferable concepts across tasks. In\nparallel, there has been great progress in learning generalizable semantic\nrepresentations for vision and language by training on large-scale internet\ndata, however these representations lack the spatial understanding necessary\nfor fine-grained manipulation. To this end, we propose a framework that\ncombines the best of both worlds: a two-stream architecture with semantic and\nspatial pathways for vision-based manipulation.

    "abstract": "The current state of adoption of well-structured electronic health records\nand integration of digital methods for storing medical patient data in\nstructured formats can often considered as inferior compared to the use of\ntraditional, unstructured text based patient data documentation. Data mining in\nthe field of medical data analysis often needs to rely solely on processing of\nunstructured data to retrieve relevant data. In natural language processing\n(NLP), statistical models have been shown successful in various tasks like\npart-of-speech tagging, relation extraction (RE) and named entity recognition\n(NER). In this work, we present GERNERMED, the first open, neural NLP model for\nNER tasks dedicated to detect medical entity types in German text data. Here,\nwe avoid the conflicting goals of protection of sensitive patient data from\ntraining data extraction and the publication of the statistical model weights\nby training our model on a custom dataset that was translated from publicly\navailable datasets in foreign language by a pretrained neural machine\ntranslation model.

Since such\nequipment generally operates under challenging working conditions, which can\nlead to untimely failures, accurate remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is\nessential for maintenance planning and to prevent catastrophic failures. In\nthis work, we address current challenges in data-driven RUL prediction for\nrotating machinery. The challenges revolve around the accuracy and uncertainty\nquantification of the prediction, and the non-stationarity of the system\ndegradation and RUL estimation given sensor data. We devise a novel\narchitecture and RUL prediction model with uncertainty quantification, termed\nVisPro, which integrates time-frequency analysis, deep learning image\nrecognition, and nonstationary Gaussian process regression. We analyze and\nbenchmark the results obtained with our model against those of other advanced\ndata-driven RUL prediction models for rotating machinery using the PHM12\nbearing vibration dataset. The computational experiments show that (1) the\nVisPro predictions are highly accurate and provide significant improvements\nover existing prediction models (three times more accurate than the second-best\nmodel), and (2) the RUL uncertainty bounds are valid and informative. We\nidentify and discuss the architectural and modeling choices made that explain\nthis excellent predictive performance of VisPro.",

    "abstract": "The Opportunistic Spectrum Access (OSA) model has been developed for the\nsecondary users (SUs) to exploit the stochastic dynamics of licensed channels\nfor file transfer in an opportunistic manner. Common approaches to design\nchannel sensing strategies for throughput-oriented applications tend to\nmaximize the long-term throughput, with the hope that it provides reduced file\ntransfer time as well. In this paper, we show that this is not correct in\ngeneral, especially for small files.

We formulate\na mathematical framework for the static policy, and extend to dynamic policy by\nmapping our file transfer problem to the stochastic shortest path problem. We\nanalyze the performance of our proposed static optimal and dynamic optimal\npolicies over the policy that maximizes long-term throughput.

    "abstract": "The prospect of achieving quantum advantage with Quantum Neural Networks\n(QNNs) is exciting. Understanding how QNN properties (e.g., the number of\nparameters $M$) affect the loss landscape is crucial to the design of scalable\nQNN architectures. Here, we rigorously analyze the overparametrization\nphenomenon in QNNs with periodic structure. We define overparametrization as\nthe regime where the QNN has more than a critical number of parameters $M_c$\nthat allows it to explore all relevant directions in state space. Our main\nresults show that the dimension of the Lie algebra obtained from the generators\nof the QNN is an upper bound for $M_c$, and for the maximal rank that the\nquantum Fisher information and Hessian matrices can reach. Underparametrized\nQNNs have spurious local minima in the loss landscape that start disappearing\nwhen $M\\geq M_c$. Thus, the overparametrization onset corresponds to a\ncomputational phase transition where the QNN trainability is greatly improved\nby a more favorable landscape. We then connect the notion of\noverparametrization to the QNN capacity, so that when a QNN is\noverparametrized, its capacity achieves its maximum possible value. We run\nnumerical simulations for eigensolver, compilation, and autoencoding\napplications to showcase the overparametrization computational phase\ntransition.

Many of these and other data-driven policies are based on known,\ndeterministic rules to ensure their transparency and interpretability. This is\nespecially true when such policies are used for public policy decision-making.\nFor example, algorithmic pre-trial risk assessments, which serve as our\nmotivating application, provide relatively simple, deterministic classification\nscores and recommendations to help judges make release decisions.\nUnfortunately, existing methods for policy learning are not applicable because\nthey require existing policies to be stochastic rather than deterministic. We\ndevelop a robust optimization approach that partially identifies the expected\nutility of a policy, and then finds an optimal policy by minimizing the\nworst-case regret. The resulting policy is conservative but has a statistical\nsafety guarantee, allowing the policy-maker to limit the probability of\nproducing a worse outcome than the existing policy. We extend this approach to\ncommon and important settings where humans make decisions with the aid of\nalgorithmic recommendations.

    "abstract": "Effective selection of the potential candidates that meet certain conditions\nin a tremendously large search space has been one of the major concerns in many\nreal-world applications. In addition to the nearly infinitely large search\nspace, rigorous evaluation of a sample based on the reliable experimental or\ncomputational platform is often prohibitively expensive, making the screening\nproblem more challenging. In such a case, constructing a high-throughput\nscreening (HTS) pipeline that pre-sifts the samples expected to be potential\ncandidates through the efficient earlier stages, results in a significant\namount of savings in resources. However, to the best of our knowledge, despite\nmany successful applications, no one has studied optimal pipeline design or\noptimal pipeline operations. In this study, we propose two optimization\nframeworks, applying to most (if not all) screening campaigns involving\nexperimental or/and computational evaluations, for optimally determining the\nscreening thresholds of an HTS pipeline. We validate the proposed frameworks on\nboth analytic and practical scenarios. In particular, we consider the optimal\ncomputational campaign for the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) classification as a\npractical example. To accomplish this, we built the high-throughput virtual\nscreening (HTVS) pipeline for classifying the lncRNA. The simulation results\ndemonstrate that the proposed frameworks significantly reduce the effective\nselection cost per potential candidate and make the HTS pipelines less\nsensitive to their structural variations.

    "abstract": "View planning for the acquisition of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR)\nrequires acquaintance with the cardiac anatomy and remains a challenging task\nin clinical practice. Existing approaches to its automation relied either on an\nadditional volumetric image not typically acquired in clinic routine, or on\nlaborious manual annotations of cardiac structural landmarks. This work\npresents a clinic-compatible and annotation-free system for automatic CMR view\nplanning. The system mines the spatial relationship -- more specifically,\nlocates and exploits the intersecting lines -- between the source and target\nviews, and trains deep networks to regress heatmaps defined by these\nintersecting lines. As the spatial relationship is self-contained in properly\nstored data, e.g., in the DICOM format, the need for manual annotation is\neliminated. Then, a multi-view planning strategy is proposed to aggregate\ninformation from the predicted heatmaps for all the source views of a target\nview, for a globally optimal prescription. The multi-view aggregation mimics\nthe similar strategy practiced by skilled human prescribers. Experimental\nresults on 181 clinical CMR exams show that our system achieves superior\naccuracy to existing approaches including conventional atlas-based and newer\ndeep learning based ones, in prescribing four standard CMR views.

The results of our\nexperiments show that the proposed method improves the network's performance on\nreal images by a considerable margin and can be employed in 3D reconstruction\npipelines.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the major blindness-causing diseases\ncurrent-ly known. Automatic grading of DR using deep learning methods not only\nspeeds up the diagnosis of the disease but also reduces the rate of\nmisdiagnosis. However, problems such as insufficient samples and imbalanced\nclass distribu-tion in DR datasets have constrained the improvement of grading\nperformance. In this paper, we introduce the idea of multi-stage transfer into\nthe grading task of DR. The new transfer learning technique leverages multiple\ndatasets with differ-ent scales to enable the model to learn more feature\nrepresentation information. Meanwhile, to cope with imbalanced DR datasets, we\npresent a class-balanced loss function that performs well in natural image\nclassification tasks, and adopt a simple and easy-to-implement training method\nfor it. The experimental results show that the application of multi-stage\ntransfer and class-balanced loss function can effectively improve the grading\nperformance metrics such as accuracy and quadratic weighted kappa. In fact, our\nmethod has outperformed two state-of-the-art methods and achieved the best\nresult on the DR grading task of IDRiD Sub-Challenge 2.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an innovative machine learning methodology that leverages\non long-term vibroacoustic measurements to perform automated predictions of the\nneeded pigging operations in crude oil trunklines. Historical pressure signals\nhave been collected by Eni (e-vpms monitoring system) for two years on discrete\npoints at a relative distance of 30-35 km along an oil pipeline (100 km length,\n16 inch diameter pipes) located in Northern Italy. In order to speed up the\nactivity and to check the operation logs, a tool has been implemented to\nautomatically highlight the historical pig operations performed on the line.\nSuch a tool is capable of detecting, in the observed pressure measurements, the\nacoustic noise generated by the travelling pig. All the data sets have been\nreanalyzed and exploited by using field data validations to guide a decision\ntree regressor (DTR). Several statistical indicators, computed from pressure\nhead loss between line segments, are fed to the DTR, which automatically\noutputs probability values indicating the possible need for pigging the\npipeline. The procedure is applied to the vibroacoustic signals of each pair of\nconsecutive monitoring stations, such that the proposed predictive maintenance\nstrategy is capable of tracking the conditions of individual pipeline sections,\nthus determining which portion of the conduit is subject to the highest\nocclusion levels in order to optimize the clean-up operations. Prediction\naccuracy is assessed by evaluating the typical metrics used in statistical\nanalysis of regression problems, such as the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).",

The\nPortuguese health authorities are currently using some decision analysis-like\ntechniques to assess the impact of this pandemic and implementing measures for\neach county, region, or the whole country. Such decision tools led to some\ncriticism and many stakeholders asked for novel approaches, in particular those\nhaving in consideration dynamical changes in the pandemic behavior arising,\ne.g., from new virus variants or vaccines. A multidisciplinary team formed by\nresearchers of the Covid-19 Committee of Instituto Superior T\\'ecnico at\nUniversidade de Lisboa (CCIST analysts team) and medical doctors from the\nCrisis Office of the Portuguese Medical Association (GCOM experts team)\ngathered efforts and worked together in order to propose a new tool to help\npoliticians and decision-makers in the combat of the pandemic.

We study a regularized form of the kernel least-squares temporal\ndifference (LSTD) estimate; in the population limit of infinite data, it\ncorresponds to the fixed point of a projected Bellman operator defined by the\nassociated reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The estimator itself is obtained\nby computing the projected fixed point induced by a regularized version of the\nempirical operator; due to the underlying kernel structure, this reduces to\nsolving a linear system involving kernel matrices. We analyze the error of this\nestimate in the $L^2(\\mu)$-norm, where $\\mu$ denotes the stationary\ndistribution of the underlying Markov chain. Our analysis imposes no\nassumptions on the transition operator of the Markov chain, but rather only\nconditions on the reward function and population-level kernel LSTD solutions.\nWe use empirical process theory techniques to derive a non-asymptotic upper\nbound on the error with explicit dependence on the eigenvalues of the\nassociated kernel operator, as well as the instance-dependent variance of the\nBellman residual error. In addition, we prove minimax lower bounds over\nsub-classes of MRPs, which shows that our rate is optimal in terms of the\nsample size $n$ and the effective horizon $H = (1 - \\gamma)^{-1}$. Whereas\nexisting worst-case theory predicts cubic scaling ($H^3$) in the effective\nhorizon, our theory reveals that there is in fact a much wider range of\nscalings, depending on the kernel, the stationary distribution, and the\nvariance of the Bellman residual error. Notably, it is only parametric and\nnear-parametric problems that can ever achieve the worst-case cubic scaling.",

    "abstract": "Localizing moving targets in unknown harsh environments has always been a\nsevere challenge. This letter investigates a novel localization system based on\nmulti-agent networks, where multiple agents serve as mobile anchors\nbroadcasting their time-space information to the targets. We study how the\nmoving target can localize itself using the sequential time of arrival (TOA) of\nthe one-way broadcast signals. An extended two-step weighted least squares\n(TSWLS) method is proposed to jointly estimate the position and velocity of the\ntarget in the presence of agent information uncertainties. We also address the\nlarge target clock offset (LTCO) problem for numerical stability. Analytical\nresults reveal that our method reaches the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) under\nsmall noises. Numerical results show that the proposed method performs better\nthan the existing algorithms.",

    "title": "Combining Discrete Choice Models and Neural Networks through Embeddings:  Formulation, Interpretability and Performance",
    "abstract": "This study proposes a novel approach that combines theory and data-driven\nchoice models using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). In particular, we use\ncontinuous vector representations, called embeddings, for encoding categorical\nor discrete explanatory variables with a special focus on interpretability and\nmodel transparency. Although embedding representations within the logit\nframework have been conceptualized by Camara (2019), their dimensions do not\nhave an absolute definitive meaning, hence offering limited behavioral\ninsights. The novelty of our work lies in enforcing interpretability to the\nembedding vectors by formally associating each of their dimensions to a choice\nalternative. Thus, our approach brings benefits much beyond a simple\nparsimonious representation improvement over dummy encoding, as it provides\nbehaviorally meaningful outputs that can be used in travel demand analysis and\npolicy decisions. Additionally, in contrast to previously suggested ANN-based\nDiscrete Choice Models (DCMs) that either sacrifice interpretability for\nperformance or are only partially interpretable, our models preserve\ninterpretability of the utility coefficients for all the input variables\ndespite being based on ANN principles. The proposed models were tested on two\nreal world datasets and evaluated against benchmark and baseline models that\nuse dummy-encoding. The results of the experiments indicate that our models\ndeliver state-of-the-art predictive performance, outperforming existing\nANN-based models while drastically reducing the number of required network\nparameters.",

Here we investigate the axiomatic\nrequirements that guarantee the in-principle feasibility of process tomography\nin general physical theories. Specifically, we explore the requirement that\nprocess tomography should be achievable with a finite number of auxiliary\nsystems. We show that this requirement is satisfied in every theory equipped\nwith universal extensions, that is, correlated states from which all other\ncorrelations can be generated with non-zero probability. We show that universal\nextensions exist in two cases: (1) theories permitting conclusive state\nteleportation, and (2) theories satisfying three properties of Causality, Pure\nProduct States, and Purification. In the second case, the existence of\nuniversal extensions follows from a symmetry property of Purification, whereby\nall pure bipartite states with the same marginal on one system are\ninterconvertible. Crucially, our results hold even in theories that do not\nsatisfy Local Tomography, the property that the state of any composite system\ncan be identified from the correlations of local measurements. Summarizing, the\nexistence of universal extensions, without any additional requirement of Local\nTomography, is a sufficient guarantee for the characterizability of physical\nprocesses using a finite number of auxiliary systems.",

    "abstract": "With COVID-19 affecting every country globally and changing everyday life,\nthe ability to forecast the spread of the disease is more important than any\nprevious epidemic. The conventional methods of disease-spread modeling,\ncompartmental models, are based on the assumption of spatiotemporal homogeneity\nof the spread of the virus, which may cause forecasting to underperform,\nespecially at high spatial resolutions. In this paper we approach the\nforecasting task with an alternative technique -- spatiotemporal machine\nlearning. We present COVID-LSTM, a data-driven model based on a Long Short-term\nMemory deep learning architecture for forecasting COVID-19 incidence at the\ncounty-level in the US. We use the weekly number of new positive cases as\ntemporal input, and hand-engineered spatial features from Facebook movement and\nconnectedness datasets to capture the spread of the disease in time and space.\nCOVID-LSTM outperforms the COVID-19 Forecast Hub's Ensemble model\n(COVIDhub-ensemble) on our 17-week evaluation period, making it the first model\nto be more accurate than the COVIDhub-ensemble over one or more forecast\nperiods. Over the 4-week forecast horizon, our model is on average 50 cases per\ncounty more accurate than the COVIDhub-ensemble. We highlight that the\nunderutilization of data-driven forecasting of disease spread prior to COVID-19\nis likely due to the lack of sufficient data available for previous diseases,\nin addition to the recent advances in machine learning methods for\nspatiotemporal forecasting. We discuss the impediments to the wider uptake of\ndata-driven forecasting, and whether it is likely that more deep learning-based\nmodels will be used in the future.",

When solvent effects are explicitly\nconsidered, MC methods become very expensive due to the large degree of freedom\nassociated with the water molecules and mobile ions. Alternatively\nimplicit-solvent MC can largely reduce the computational cost by applying a\nmean field approximation to solvent effects and meanwhile maintains the atomic\ndetail of the target molecule. The two most popular implicit-solvent models are\nthe Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) model and the Generalized Born (GB) model in a way\nsuch that the GB model is an approximation to the PB model but is much faster\nin simulation time. In this work, we develop a machine learning-based\nimplicit-solvent Monte Carlo (MLIMC) method by combining the advantages of both\nimplicit solvent models in accuracy and efficiency.

Phenomenological clipping also occurs in\nturbulence models to correct for over dissipation caused by the action of eddy\nviscosity terms in regions of small scales. Herein we analyze eddy viscosity\nmodel energy dissipation rates with 2 phenomenological clipping strategies.\nSince the true Reynolds stresses are O(d^2) (d= wall normal distance) in the\nnear wall region, the first is to force this near wall behavior in the eddy\nviscosity by clipping the turbulent viscosity. The second is Escudier's early\nproposal to clip the turbulence length scale, reducing too large values in the\ninterior of the flow.

Our\nproposed model, termed as ImplicitVol, takes a set of 2D scans and their\nestimated locations in 3D as input, jointly re?fing the estimated 3D locations\nand learning a full reconstruction of the 3D volume. When testing on real 2D\nultrasound images, novel cross-sectional views that are sampled from\nImplicitVol show significantly better visual quality than those sampled from\nexisting reconstruction approaches, outperforming them by over 30% (NCC and\nSSIM), between the output and ground-truth on the 3D volume testing data.
