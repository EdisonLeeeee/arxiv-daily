    "abstract": "This white paper demonstrates how the assurance, reliability, and security of\nan existing professional-grade, open-source embedded TCP/IP stack\nimplementation written in the C programming language is significantly enhanced\nby adopting the SPARK technology. A multifaceted approach achieves this.\nFirstly, the TCP layer's C code is being replaced with formally verified SPARK,\na subset of the Ada programming language supported by formal verification\ntools. Then the lower layers, still written in C and on which the TCP layer\ndepends, are modeled using SPARK contracts and validated using symbolic\nexecution with KLEE. Finally, formal contracts for the upper layers are defined\nto call the TCP layer. The work allowed the detection and correction of two\nbugs in the TCP layer. In an increasingly connected world, where Cyber Security\nis of paramount importance, the powerful approach detailed in this work can be\napplied to any existing critical C library to harden their reliability and\nsecurity significantly.",

    "abstract": "Computing latent representations for graph-structured data is an ubiquitous\nlearning task in many industrial and academic applications ranging from\nmolecule synthetization to social network analysis and recommender systems.\nKnowledge graphs are among the most popular and widely used data\nrepresentations related to the Semantic Web. Next to structuring factual\nknowledge in a machine-readable format, knowledge graphs serve as the backbone\nof many artificial intelligence applications and allow the ingestion of context\ninformation into various learning algorithms. Graph neural networks attempt to\nencode graph structures in low-dimensional vector spaces via a message passing\nheuristic between neighboring nodes. Over the recent years, a multitude of\ndifferent graph neural network architectures demonstrated ground-breaking\nperformances in many learning tasks. In this work, we propose a strategy to map\ndeep graph learning architectures for knowledge graph reasoning to neuromorphic\narchitectures. Based on the insight that randomly initialized and untrained\n(i.e., frozen) graph neural networks are able to preserve local graph\nstructures, we compose a frozen neural network with shallow knowledge graph\nembedding models. We experimentally show that already on conventional computing\nhardware, this leads to a significant speedup and memory reduction while\nmaintaining a competitive performance level. Moreover, we extend the frozen\narchitecture to spiking neural networks, introducing a novel, event-based and\nhighly sparse knowledge graph embedding algorithm that is suitable for\nimplementation in neuromorphic hardware.",

    "abstract": "Since 2011, significant and atypical arrival of two species of surface\ndwelling algae, Sargassum natans and Sargassum Fluitans, have been detected in\nthe Mexican Caribbean. This massive accumulation of algae has had a great\nenvironmental and economic impact. Therefore, for the government, ecologists,\nand local businesses, it is important to keep track of the amount of sargassum\nthat arrives on the Caribbean coast. High-resolution satellite imagery is\nexpensive or may be time delayed. Therefore, we propose to estimate the amount\nof sargassum based on ground-level smartphone photographs. From the computer\nvision perspective, the problem is quite difficult since no information about\nthe 3D world is provided, in consequence, we have to model it as a\nclassification problem, where a set of five labels define the amount. For this\npurpose, we have built a dataset with more than one thousand examples from\npublic forums such as Facebook or Instagram and we have tested several\nstate-of-the-art convolutional networks. As a result, the VGG network trained\nunder fine-tuning showed the best performance.

    "abstract": "Standard Model Predictive Control (MPC) or trajectory optimization approaches\nperform only a local search to solve a complex non-convex optimization problem.\nAs a result, they cannot capture the multi-modal characteristic of human\ndriving. A global optimizer can be a potential solution but is computationally\nintractable in a real-time setting. In this paper, we present a real-time MPC\ncapable of searching over different driving modalities. Our basic idea is\nsimple: we run several goal-directed parallel trajectory optimizations and\nscore the resulting trajectories based on user-defined meta cost functions.\nThis allows us to perform a global search over several locally optimal motion\nplans. Although conceptually straightforward, realizing this idea in real-time\nwith existing optimizers is highly challenging from technical and computational\nstandpoints. With this motivation, we present a novel batch non-holonomic\ntrajectory optimization whose underlying matrix algebra is easily\nparallelizable across problem instances and reduces to computing large batch\nmatrix-vector products. This structure, in turn, is achieved by deriving a\nlinearization-free multi-convex reformulation of the non-holonomic kinematics\nand collision avoidance constraints. We extensively validate our approach using\nboth synthetic and real data sets (NGSIM) of traffic scenarios. We highlight\nhow our algorithm automatically takes lane-change and overtaking decisions\nbased on the defined meta cost function.

To address realizability and scalability of BT applied to highly\nstiff and lightly-damped systems, a non-intrusive data-driven method is\ndeveloped for balancing discrete-time systems via the eigensystem realization\nalgorithm (ERA). The advantage of ERA for balancing transformation makes\nfull-state outputs tractable. Further, ERA enables balancing despite stiffness,\nby eliminating computation of balancing modes and adjoint simulations. As a\ndemonstrative example, we create balanced ROMs for a one-dimensional reactive\nflow with pressure forcing, where the stiffness introduced by the chemical\nsource term is extreme (condition number $10^{13}$), preventing analytical\nimplementation of BT. We investigate the performance of ROMs in prediction of\ndynamics with unseen forcing inputs and demonstrate stability and accuracy of\nbalanced ROMs in truly predictive scenarios whereas without ERA, POD-Galerkin\nand Least-squares Petrov-Galerkin projections fail to represent the true\ndynamics. We show that after the initial transients under unit impulse forcing,\nthe system undergoes lightly-damped oscillations, which magnifies the influence\nof sampling properties on predictive performance of the balanced ROMs. The\nimportance of proper sampling is established via sensitivity analysis in a\npredictive setting.",

By converting binary code into images, researchers have shown\nsatisfactory results in applying machine learning to extract features that are\ndifficult to discover manually. Such visualization-based malware detection\nmethods can capture malware patterns from many different malware families and\nimprove malware detection speed. On the other hand, recent research has also\nshown adversarial attacks against such visualization-based malware detection.\nAttackers can generate adversarial examples by perturbing the malware binary in\nnon-reachable regions, such as padding at the end of the binary. Alternatively,\nattackers can perturb the malware image embedding and then verify the\nexecutability of the malware post-transformation. One major limitation of the\nfirst attack scenario is that a simple pre-processing step can remove the\nperturbations before classification. For the second attack scenario, it is hard\nto maintain the original malware's executability and functionality. In this\nwork, we provide literature review on existing malware visualization techniques\nand attacks against them.

    "title": "Fairness without Imputation: A Decision Tree Approach for Fair  Prediction with Missing Values",
    "abstract": "We investigate the fairness concerns of training a machine learning model\nusing data with missing values. Even though there are a number of fairness\nintervention methods in the literature, most of them require a complete\ntraining set as input. In practice, data can have missing values, and data\nmissing patterns can depend on group attributes (e.g. gender or race). Simply\napplying off-the-shelf fair learning algorithms to an imputed dataset may lead\nto an unfair model. In this paper, we first theoretically analyze different\nsources of discrimination risks when training with an imputed dataset. Then, we\npropose an integrated approach based on decision trees that does not require a\nseparate process of imputation and learning. Instead, we train a tree with\nmissing incorporated as attribute (MIA), which does not require explicit\nimputation, and we optimize a fairness-regularized objective function. We\ndemonstrate that our approach outperforms existing fairness intervention\nmethods applied to an imputed dataset, through several experiments on\nreal-world datasets.",

    "title": "Beyond Discriminant Patterns: On the Robustness of Decision Rule  Ensembles",
    "abstract": "Local decision rules are commonly understood to be more explainable, due to\nthe local nature of the patterns involved. With numerical optimization methods\nsuch as gradient boosting, ensembles of local decision rules can gain good\npredictive performance on data involving global structure. Meanwhile, machine\nlearning models are being increasingly used to solve problems in high-stake\ndomains including healthcare and finance. Here, there is an emerging consensus\nregarding the need for practitioners to understand whether and how those models\ncould perform robustly in the deployment environments, in the presence of\ndistributional shifts. Past research on local decision rules has focused mainly\non maximizing discriminant patterns, without due consideration of robustness\nagainst distributional shifts. In order to fill this gap, we propose a new\nmethod to learn and ensemble local decision rules, that are robust both in the\ntraining and deployment environments. Specifically, we propose to leverage\ncausal knowledge by regarding the distributional shifts in subpopulations and\ndeployment environments as the results of interventions on the underlying\nsystem. We propose two regularization terms based on causal knowledge to search\nfor optimal and stable rules. Experiments on both synthetic and benchmark\ndatasets show that our method is effective and robust against distributional\nshifts in multiple environments.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a Visual Teach and Repeat (VTR) algorithm using\nsemantic landmarks extracted from environmental objects for ground robots with\nfixed mount monocular cameras. The proposed algorithm is robust to changes in\nthe starting pose of the camera/robot, where a pose is defined as the planar\nposition plus the orientation around the vertical axis. VTR consists of a teach\nphase in which a robot moves in a prescribed path, and a repeat phase in which\nthe robot tries to repeat the same path starting from the same or a different\npose. Most available VTR algorithms are pose dependent and cannot perform well\nin the repeat phase when starting from an initial pose far from that of the\nteach phase. To achieve more robust pose independency, during the teach phase,\nwe collect the camera poses and the 3D point clouds of the environment using\nORB-SLAM. We also detect objects in the environment using YOLOv3. We then\ncombine the two outputs to build a 3D semantic map of the environment\nconsisting of the 3D position of the objects and the robot path. In the repeat\nphase, we relocalize the robot based on the detected objects and the stored\nsemantic map. The robot is then able to move toward the teach path, and repeat\nit in both forward and backward directions. The results show that our algorithm\nis highly robust with respect to pose variations as well as environmental\nalterations.

Accurate vehicle localization is\noften achieved via expensive inertial navigation systems or by employing\ncompute-intensive vision processing (LiDAR/camera) to augment the low-cost and\nnoisy inertial sensors. Here we have developed a framework for fusing the\ninformation obtained from a smart infrastructure node (ix-node) with the\nautonomous vehicles on-board localization engine to estimate the robust and\naccurate pose of the ego-vehicle even with cheap inertial sensors. A smart\nix-node is typically used to augment the perception capability of an autonomous\nvehicle, especially when the onboard perception sensors of AVs are blocked by\nthe dynamic and static objects in the environment thereby making them\nineffectual. In this work, we utilize this perception output from an ix-node to\nincrease the localization accuracy of the AV. The fusion of ix-node perception\noutput with the vehicle's low-cost inertial sensors allows us to perform\nreliable vehicle localization without the need for relying on expensive\ninertial navigation systems or compute-intensive vision processing onboard the\nAVs.

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel method to teach a robotic agent to interactively explore\ncluttered yet structured scenes, such as kitchen pantries and grocery shelves,\nby leveraging the physical plausibility of the scene. We propose a novel\nlearning framework to train an effective scene exploration policy to discover\nhidden objects with minimal interactions. First, we define a novel scene\ngrammar to represent structured clutter. Then we train a Graph Neural Network\n(GNN) based Scene Generation agent using deep reinforcement learning (deep RL),\nto manipulate this Scene Grammar to create a diverse set of stable scenes, each\ncontaining multiple hidden objects. Given such cluttered scenes, we then train\na Scene Exploration agent, using deep RL, to uncover hidden objects by\ninteractively rearranging the scene. We show that our learned agents hide and\ndiscover significantly more objects than the baselines. We present quantitative\nresults that prove the generalization capabilities of our agents. We also\ndemonstrate sim-to-real transfer by successfully deploying the learned policy\non a real UR10 robot to explore real-world cluttered scenes.

    "abstract": "WhatsApp emerged as a major communication platform in many countries in the\nrecent years. Despite offering only one-to-one and small group conversations,\nWhatsApp has been shown to enable the formation of a rich underlying network,\ncrossing the boundaries of existing groups, and with structural properties that\nfavor information dissemination at large. Indeed, WhatsApp has reportedly been\nused as a forum of misinformation campaigns with significant social, political\nand economic consequences in several countries. In this article, we aim at\ncomplementing recent studies on misinformation spread on WhatsApp, mostly\nfocused on content properties and propagation dynamics, by looking into the\nnetwork that connects users sharing the same piece of content. Specifically, we\npresent a hierarchical network-oriented characterization of the users engaged\nin misinformation spread by focusing on three perspectives: individuals,\nWhatsApp groups and user communities, i.e., groupings of users who,\nintentionally or not, share the same content disproportionately often. By\nanalyzing sharing and network topological properties, our study offers valuable\ninsights into how WhatsApp users leverage the underlying network connecting\ndifferent groups to gain large reach in the spread of misinformation on the\nplatform.",

    "abstract": "The Mixture of Experts (MoE) models are an emerging class of sparsely\nactivated deep learning models that have sublinear compute costs with respect\nto their parameters. In contrast with dense models, the sparse architecture of\nMoE offers opportunities for drastically growing model size with significant\naccuracy gain while consuming much lower compute budget. However, supporting\nlarge scale MoE training also has its own set of system and modeling\nchallenges. To overcome the challenges and embrace the opportunities of MoE, we\nfirst develop a system capable of scaling MoE models efficiently to trillions\nof parameters. It combines multi-dimensional parallelism and heterogeneous\nmemory technologies harmoniously with MoE to empower 8x larger models on the\nsame hardware compared with existing work. Besides boosting system efficiency,\nwe also present new training methods to improve MoE sample efficiency and\nleverage expert pruning strategy to improve inference time efficiency. By\ncombining the efficient system and training methods, we are able to\nsignificantly scale up large multitask multilingual models for language\ngeneration which results in a great improvement in model accuracy. A model\ntrained with 10 billion parameters on 50 languages can achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance in Machine Translation (MT) and multilingual natural language\ngeneration tasks.

Rewinding this\nprocess seems trivial if we have access to all intermediate log-likelihood\nratios (LLRs) and partial sums. However, as the block length increases,\nretaining all of the intermediate information becomes inefficient and\nimpractical. Rewinding the SC process in a memory-efficient way is a problem\nthat we address in this paper. We first explore the properties of the SC\nprocess based on the binary representation of the bit indices by introducing a\nnew operator used for grouping the bit indices. This special grouping helps us\nin finding the closest bit index to the target index for rewinding. We also\nanalytically prove that this approach gives access to the untouched\nintermediate information stored in the memory which is essential in resuming\nthe SC process. Then, we adapt the proposed approach to multiple rewinds and\napply it on SC-flip decoding and shifted-pruning based list decoding. The\nnumerical evaluation of the proposed solution shows a significant reduction of\n>=50% in the complexity of the additional decoding attempts at medium and high\nSNR regimes for SC-flip decoding and less for shifted-pruning based list\ndecoding.",

The challenge comes from the discrete and\nnon-differentiable nature of molecule structures. To address this, we propose\ndifferentiable scaffolding tree (DST) that utilizes a learned knowledge network\nto convert discrete chemical structures to locally differentiable ones.

Multi-view object detection effectively\nsolves this problem by combining data from different perspectives.

In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view\n3D object detection method named MVM3Det which simultaneously estimates the 3D\nposition and orientation of the object according to the multi-view monocular\ninformation. The method consists of two parts: 1) Position proposal network,\nwhich integrates the features from different perspectives into consistent\nglobal features through feature orthogonal transformation to estimate the\nposition. 2) Multi-branch orientation estimation network, which introduces\nfeature perspective pooling to overcome the two confusion problems during the\norientation estimation.

    "abstract": "Major bottlenecks of large-scale Federated Learning(FL) networks are the high\ncosts for communication and computation. This is due to the fact that most of\ncurrent FL frameworks only consider a star network topology where all local\ntrained models are aggregated at a single server (e.g., a cloud server). This\ncauses significant overhead at the server when the number of users are huge and\nlocal models' sizes are large. This paper proposes a novel edge network\narchitecture which decentralizes the model aggregation process at the server,\nthereby significantly reducing the aggregation latency of the whole network. In\nthis architecture, we propose a highly-effective in-network computation\nprotocol consisting of two components. First, an in-network aggregation process\nis designed so that the majority of aggregation computations can be offloaded\nfrom cloud server to edge nodes. Second, a joint routing and resource\nallocation optimization problem is formulated to minimize the aggregation\nlatency for the whole system at every learning round. The problem turns out to\nbe NP-hard, and thus we propose a polynomial time routing algorithm which can\nachieve near optimal performance with a theoretical bound. Numerical results\nshow that our proposed framework can dramatically reduce the network latency,\nup to 4.6 times. Furthermore, this framework can significantly decrease cloud's\ntraffic and computing overhead by a factor of K/M, where K is the number of\nusers and M is the number of edge nodes, in comparison with conventional\nbaselines.",

    "title": "Single Image Dehazing with An Independent Detail-Recovery Network",
    "abstract": "Single image dehazing is a prerequisite which affects the performance of many\ncomputer vision tasks and has attracted increasing attention in recent years.\nHowever, most existing dehazing methods emphasize more on haze removal but less\non the detail recovery of the dehazed images. In this paper, we propose a\nsingle image dehazing method with an independent Detail Recovery Network (DRN),\nwhich considers capturing the details from the input image over a separate\nnetwork and then integrates them into a coarse dehazed image. The overall\nnetwork consists of two independent networks, named DRN and the dehazing\nnetwork respectively. Specifically, the DRN aims to recover the dehazed image\ndetails through local and global branches respectively. The local branch can\nobtain local detail information through the convolution layer and the global\nbranch can capture more global information by the Smooth Dilated Convolution\n(SDC). The detail feature map is fused into the coarse dehazed image to obtain\nthe dehazed image with rich image details. Besides, we integrate the DRN, the\nphysical-model-based dehazing network and the reconstruction loss into an\nend-to-end joint learning framework. Extensive experiments on the public image\ndehazing datasets (RESIDE-Indoor, RESIDE-Outdoor and the TrainA-TestA)\nillustrate the effectiveness of the modules in the proposed method and show\nthat our method outperforms the state-of-the-art dehazing methods both\nquantitatively and qualitatively.

    "abstract": "This paper presents an approach for improving navigation in dynamic and\ninteractive environments, which won the 1st place in the iGibson Interactive\nNavigation Challenge 2021. While the last few years have produced impressive\nprogress on PointGoal Navigation in static environments, relatively little\neffort has been made on more realistic dynamic environments. The iGibson\nChallenge proposed two new navigation tasks, Interactive Navigation and Social\nNavigation, which add displaceable obstacles and moving pedestrians into the\nsimulator environment. Our approach to study these problems uses two key ideas.\nFirst, we employ large-scale reinforcement learning by leveraging the Habitat\nsimulator, which supports high performance parallel computing for both\nsimulation and synchronized learning. Second, we employ a new data augmentation\ntechnique that adds more dynamic objects into the environment, which can also\nbe combined with traditional image-based augmentation techniques to boost the\nperformance further. Lastly, we achieve sim-to-sim transfer from Habitat to the\niGibson simulator, and demonstrate that our proposed methods allow us to train\nrobust agents in dynamic environments with interactive objects or moving\nhumans.

    "abstract": "In the open question answering (OBQA) task, how to select the relevant\ninformation from a large corpus is a crucial problem for reasoning and\ninference. Some datasets (e.g, HotpotQA) mainly focus on testing the model's\nreasoning ability at the sentence level. To overcome this challenge, many\nexisting frameworks use a deep learning model to select relevant passages and\nthen answer each question by matching a sentence in the corresponding passage.\nHowever, such frameworks require long inference time and fail to take advantage\nof the relationship between passages and sentences. In this work, we present a\nsimple yet effective framework to address these problems by jointly ranking\npassages and selecting sentences. We propose consistency and similarity\nconstraints to promote the correlation and interaction between passage ranking\nand sentence selection.

Previous mainstream VLP approaches typically adopt a two-step\nstrategy relying on external object detectors to encode images in a multi-modal\nTransformer framework, which suffer from restrictive object concept space,\nlimited image context and inefficient computation. In this paper, we propose an\nobject-aware end-to-end VLP framework, which directly feeds image grid features\nfrom CNNs into the Transformer and learns the multi-modal representations\njointly. More importantly, we propose to perform object knowledge distillation\nto facilitate learning cross-modal alignment at different semantic levels. To\nachieve that, we design two novel pretext tasks by taking object features and\ntheir semantic labels from external detectors as supervision: 1.) Object-guided\nmasked vision modeling task focuses on enforcing object-aware representation\nlearning in the multi-modal Transformer; 2.) Phrase-region alignment task aims\nto improve cross-modal alignment by utilizing the similarities between noun\nphrases and object labels in the linguistic space. Extensive experiments on a\nwide range of vision-language tasks demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed\nframework, and we achieve competitive or superior performances over the\nexisting pretraining strategies.

    "abstract": "Despite the success of neural dialogue systems in achieving high performance\non the leader-board, they cannot meet users' requirements in practice, due to\ntheir poor reasoning skills. The underlying reason is that most neural dialogue\nmodels only capture the syntactic and semantic information, but fail to model\nthe logical consistency between the dialogue history and the generated\nresponse. Recently, a new multi-turn dialogue reasoning task has been proposed,\nto facilitate dialogue reasoning research. However, this task is challenging,\nbecause there are only slight differences between the illogical response and\nthe dialogue history. How to effectively solve this challenge is still worth\nexploring. This paper proposes a Fine-grained Comparison Model (FCM) to tackle\nthis problem. Inspired by human's behavior in reading comprehension, a\ncomparison mechanism is proposed to focus on the fine-grained differences in\nthe representation of each response candidate. Specifically, each candidate\nrepresentation is compared with the whole history to obtain a history\nconsistency representation. Furthermore, the consistency signals between each\ncandidate and the speaker's own history are considered to drive a model to\nprefer a candidate that is logically consistent with the speaker's history\nlogic. Finally, the above consistency representations are employed to output a\nranking list of the candidate responses for multi-turn dialogue reasoning.\nExperimental results on two public dialogue datasets show that our method\nobtains higher ranking scores than the baseline models.",

    "abstract": "When dynamic objects are captured by a camera, motion blur inevitably occurs.\nSuch a blur is sometimes considered as just a noise, however, it sometimes\ngives an important effect to add dynamism in the scene for photographs or\nvideos. Unlike the similar effects, such as defocus blur, which is now easily\ncontrolled even by smartphones, motion blur is still uncontrollable and makes\nundesired effects on photographs. In this paper, an unified framework to add\nmotion blur on per-object basis is proposed. In the method, multiple frames are\ncaptured without motion blur and they are accumulated to create motion blur on\ntarget objects. To capture images without motion blur, shutter speed must be\nshort, however, it makes captured images dark, and thus, a sensor gain should\nbe increased to compensate it. Since a sensor gain causes a severe noise on\nimage, we propose a color compensation algorithm based on non-linear filtering\ntechnique for solution. Another contribution is that our technique can be used\nto make HDR images for fast moving objects by using multi-exposure images. In\nthe experiments, effectiveness of the method is confirmed by ablation study\nusing several data sets.",

We hypothesize\nand validate that multilingual fine-tuning of pre-trained language models can\nyield better performance on downstream NLP applications, compared to models\nfine-tuned on individual languages. A first of its kind detailed study is\npresented to track performance change as languages are added to a base language\nin a graded and greedy (in the sense of best boost of performance) manner;\nwhich reveals that careful selection of subset of related languages can\nsignificantly improve performance than utilizing all related languages. The\nIndo-Aryan (IA) language family is chosen for the study, the exact languages\nbeing Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Marathi, Oriya, Punjabi and Urdu. The script\nbarrier is crossed by simple rule-based transliteration of the text of all\nlanguages to Devanagari. Experiments are performed on mBERT, IndicBERT, MuRIL\nand two RoBERTa-based LMs, the last two being pre-trained by us. Low resource\nlanguages, such as Oriya and Punjabi, are found to be the largest beneficiaries\nof multilingual fine-tuning. Textual Entailment, Entity Classification, Section\nTitle Prediction, tasks of IndicGLUE and POS tagging form our test bed.\nCompared to monolingual fine tuning we get relative performance improvement of\nup to 150% in the downstream tasks.

These two characteristics produce a meaningful\nrepresentation, where the cluster area is proportional to its size in number,\nand relationships between clusters are materialized by closeness on the\nembedding.\nThis algorithm is non-parametric, therefore two initializations of the\nalgorithm would lead to two different embedding. In a forensic approach,\nanalysts would like to compare two or more datasets using their embedding. An\napproach would be to learn a parametric model over an embedding built with a\nsubset of data. While this approach is highly scalable, points could be mapped\nat the same exact position, making them indistinguishable. This type of model\nwould be unable to adapt to new outliers nor concept drift.\nThis paper presents a methodology to reuse an embedding to create a new one,\nwhere cluster positions are preserved. The optimization process minimizes two\ncosts, one relative to the embedding shape and the second relative to the\nsupport embedding' match. The proposed algorithm has the same complexity than\nthe original $t$-SNE to embed new items, and a lower one when considering the\nembedding of a dataset sliced into sub-pieces. The method showed promising\nresults on a real-world dataset, allowing to observe the birth, evolution and\ndeath of clusters.

    "abstract": "Web search heavily relies on click-through behavior as an essential feedback\nsignal for performance improvement and evaluation. Traditionally, click is\nusually treated as a positive implicit feedback signal of relevance or\nusefulness, while non-click (especially non-click after examination) is\nregarded as a signal of irrelevance or uselessness. However, there are many\ncases where users do not click on any search results but still satisfy their\ninformation need with the contents of the results shown on the Search Engine\nResult Page (SERP). This raises the problem of measuring result usefulness and\nmodeling user satisfaction in \"Zero-click\" search scenarios.\nPrevious works have solved this issue by (1) detecting user satisfaction for\nabandoned SERP with context information and (2) considering result-level click\nnecessity with external assessors' annotations. However, few works have\ninvestigated the reason behind non-click behavior and estimated the usefulness\nof non-click results. A challenge for this research question is how to collect\nvaluable feedback for non-click results. With neuroimaging technologies, we\ndesign a lab-based user study and reveal differences in brain signals while\nexamining non-click search results with different usefulness levels. The\nfindings in significant brain regions and electroencephalogram~(EEG) spectrum\nalso suggest that the process of usefulness judgment might involve similar\ncognitive functions of relevance perception and satisfaction decoding. Inspired\nby these findings, we conduct supervised learning tasks to estimate the\nusefulness of non-click results with brain signals and conventional information\n(i.e., content and context factors). Results show that it is feasible to\nutilize brain signals to improve usefulness estimation performance and\nenhancing human-computer interactions in \"Zero-click\" search scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Due to difficulties in acquiring ground truth depth of equirectangular (360)\nimages, the quality and quantity of equirectangular depth data today is\ninsufficient to represent the various scenes in the world. Therefore, 360 depth\nestimation studies, which relied solely on supervised learning, are destined to\nproduce unsatisfactory results. Although self-supervised learning methods\nfocusing on equirectangular images (EIs) are introduced, they often have\nincorrect or non-unique solutions, causing unstable performance. In this paper,\nwe propose 360 monocular depth estimation methods which improve on the areas\nthat limited previous studies. First, we introduce a self-supervised 360 depth\nlearning method that only utilizes gravity-aligned videos, which has the\npotential to eliminate the needs for depth data during the training procedure.\nSecond, we propose a joint learning scheme realized by combining supervised and\nself-supervised learning. The weakness of each learning is compensated, thus\nleading to more accurate depth estimation. Third, we propose a non-local fusion\nblock, which retains global information encoded by vision transformer when\nreconstructing the depths. With the proposed methods, we successfully apply the\ntransformer to 360 depth estimations, to the best of our knowledge, which has\nnot been tried before.

Yet, it is no secret that under the effect of noise, these\ndistances-and thus the models based upon them-may lose their usefulness in high\ndimensions. Indeed, the small marginal effects of the noise may then accumulate\nquickly, shifting empirical closest and furthest neighbors away from the ground\ntruth. In this paper, we characterize such effects in high-dimensional data\nusing an asymptotic probabilistic expression. Furthermore, while it has been\npreviously argued that neighborhood queries become meaningless and unstable\nwhen there is a poor relative discrimination between the furthest and closest\npoint, we conclude that this is not necessarily the case when explicitly\nseparating the ground truth data from the noise. More specifically, we derive\nthat under particular conditions, empirical neighborhood relations affected by\nnoise are still likely to be true even when we observe this discrimination to\nbe poor. We include thorough empirical verification of our results, as well as\nexperiments that interestingly show our derived phase shift where neighbors\nbecome random or not is identical to the phase shift where common\ndimensionality reduction methods perform poorly or well for finding\nlow-dimensional representations of high-dimensional data with dense noise.",

In this paper, we develop a novel task of\naudio-visual grounding referring expression for robotic manipulation. The robot\nleverages both the audio and visual information to understand the referring\nexpression in the given manipulation instruction and the corresponding\nmanipulations are implemented. To solve the proposed task, an audio-visual\nframework is proposed for visual localization and sound recognition. We have\nalso established a dataset which contains visual data, auditory data and\nmanipulation instructions for evaluation. Finally, extensive experiments are\nconducted both offline and online to verify the effectiveness of the proposed\naudio-visual framework. And it is demonstrated that the robot performs better\nwith the audio-visual data than with only the visual data.",

    "abstract": "For games used in educational contexts, realism, i.e., the degree of\ncongruence between the simulation models used in the games and the real-world\nsystems represented, is an important characteristic for achieving learning\ngoals well. However, in the past, the realism of especially entertainment games\nhas often been identified as insufficient. Thus, this study is investigating\nthe degree of realism provided by current games. To this purpose, two games in\nthe domain urban water management, a subdomain of environmental engineering\n(EE), are examined. One is ANAWAK, a web-based serious game on water management\nand climate change. For ANAWAK, an analysis of the simulation model is\nconducted. Second, the simulation model of the entertainment game Cities:\nSkylines (CS) is analyzed. In addition, a survey among CS players (N=61) is\nconducted. Thereby, different degrees of realism in various EE subdomains are\nrevealed. All in all, there are still considerable deficits regarding the\ndegree of realism in the CS simulation model. However, modding as a means of\nachieving more realistic simulation models is more widely supported than in the\npast.",

We investigated the\ncooperative transportation of an unknown payload larger than that of whole\ncarrier robots through numerical simulations. Furthermore, we performed\ncooperative transportation of an unknown payload (with a weight of about 3.2 kg\nand maximum length of 1.76 m) using eight robots.

    "abstract": "Pruning has been widely used to slim convolutional neural network (CNN)\nmodels to achieve a good trade-off between accuracy and model size so that the\npruned models become feasible for power-constrained devices such as mobile\nphones. This process can be automated to avoid the expensive hand-crafted\nefforts and to explore a large pruning space automatically so that the\nhigh-performance pruning policy can be achieved efficiently. Nowadays,\nreinforcement learning (RL) and Bayesian optimization (BO)-based auto pruners\nare widely used due to their solid theoretical foundation, universality, and\nhigh compressing quality. However, the RL agent suffers from long training\ntimes and high variance of results, while the BO agent is time-consuming for\nhigh-dimensional design spaces. In this work, we propose an enhanced BO agent\nto obtain significant acceleration for auto pruning in high-dimensional design\nspaces. To achieve this, a novel clustering algorithm is proposed to reduce the\ndimension of the design space to speedup the searching process. Then, a\nroll-back algorithm is proposed to recover the high-dimensional design space so\nthat higher pruning accuracy can be obtained. We validate our proposed method\non ResNet, MobileNet, and VGG models, and our experiments show that the\nproposed method significantly improves the accuracy of BO when pruning very\ndeep CNN models.

The resulting decision-making problem for choosing the optimal\nconditional target filtering distribution under incomplete modelling is solved\nvia fully probabilistic design (FPD), i.e. via appropriate minimization of\nKullback-Leibler divergence (KLD). The resulting FPD-optimal target learner is\nrobust, in the sense that it can reject poor-quality source knowledge. In\naddition, the fact that this Bayesian transfer learning (BTL) scheme does not\ndepend on a model of interaction between the source and target tasks ensures\nrobustness to the misspecification of such a model. The latter is a problem\nthat affects conventional transfer learning methods.

In tree-based methods, a tree structure T is adopted as\nindex and each item in corpus is attached to a leaf node on T . Then the\nrecommendation problem is converted into a hierarchical retrieval problem\nsolved by a beam search process efficiently. In this paper, we argue that the\ntree index used to support efficient retrieval in tree-based methods also has\nrich hierarchical information about the corpus. Furthermore, we propose a novel\ncontext-aware tree-based deep model (ConTDM) for recommender systems. In\nConTDM, a context-aware user preference prediction model M is designed to\nutilize both horizontal and vertical contexts on T . Horizontally, a graph\nconvolutional layer is used to enrich the representation of both users and\nnodes on T with their neighbors. Vertically, a parent fusion layer is designed\nin M to transmit the user preference representation in higher levels of T to\nthe current level, grasping the essence that tree-based methods are generating\nthe candidate set from coarse to detail during the beam search retrieval.\nBesides, we argue that the proposed user preference model in ConTDM can be\nconveniently extended to other tree-based methods for recommender systems.

Recently, it has been shown in both the pole-placement control and the\n$d$-step ahead control settings that if, as part of the adaptive controller, a\nparameter estimator based on the original projection algorithm is used and the\nparameter estimates are restricted to a convex set, then the closed-loop system\nexperiences linear-like behavior: exponential stability, a bounded gain on the\nnoise in every $p$-norm, and a convolution bound on the exogenous inputs; this\ncan be leveraged to provide tolerance to unmodelled dynamics and plant\nparameter time-variation. In this paper, we extend the approach to the more\ngeneral Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) problem and demonstrate that we\nachieve the same desirable linear-like closed-loop properties.",

COVR focuses on questions that require complex\nreasoning, including higher-order operations such as quantification and\naggregation. Due to the automatic generation process, COVR facilitates the\ncreation of compositional splits, where models at test time need to generalize\nto new concepts and compositions in a zero- or few-shot setting.

The bat costs $1 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?), with\nprior, we can identify fast/slow thinking ($.10/$.05). But what if we do not\nhave prior? A very clever method, surprisingly popular, additionally asks what\npercentage of other people answer $.10/$.05 and selects the answer that is more\npopular than people predict. However, the distribution report is non-minimal\nfor many people especially for non-binary choices, the choices design requires\nprior and only the best answer is selected. Here we propose a simple minimal\nparadigm that elicits the full hierarchy of the collected answers: we ask a\nsingle open response question and elicit each respondent's answer (e.g. $.05)\nand guess(es) for other people's answers (e.g. $.10). We record the number of\npeople who report a specific answer-guess pair (e.g. 10 people answer $.05 and\nguess $.10) by an answer-guess matrix. By ranking the answers to maximize the\nsum of the upper triangular area of the matrix, we obtain and visualize the\nhierarchy of the answers without any prior.

However, it is always a challenge to achieve the consistency\nbetween the learned latent distribution and the prior latent distribution when\noptimizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO), and finally leads to an\nunsatisfactory performance in data generation. In this paper, we propose a\nlatent distribution consistency approach to avoid such substantial\ninconsistency between the posterior and prior latent distributions in ELBO\noptimizing. We name our method as latent distribution consistency VAE\n(LDC-VAE). We achieve this purpose by assuming the real posterior distribution\nin latent space as a Gibbs form, and approximating it by using our encoder.\nHowever, there is no analytical solution for such Gibbs posterior in\napproximation, and traditional approximation ways are time consuming, such as\nusing the iterative sampling-based MCMC. To address this problem, we use the\nStein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) to approximate the Gibbs posterior.\nMeanwhile, we use the SVGD to train a sampler net which can obtain efficient\nsamples from the Gibbs posterior.

Existing debiasing methods for classification models, such as\nadversarial training, are often expensive to train and difficult to optimise.\nIn this paper, we propose a method for mitigating bias in classifier training\nby incorporating contrastive learning, in which instances sharing the same\nclass label are encouraged to have similar representations, while instances\nsharing a protected attribute are forced further apart. In such a way our\nmethod learns representations which capture the task label in focused regions,\nwhile ensuring the protected attribute has diverse spread, and thus has limited\nimpact on prediction and thereby results in fairer models. Extensive\nexperimental results across four tasks in NLP and computer vision show (a) that\nour proposed method can achieve fairer representations and realises bias\nreductions compared with competitive baselines; and (b) that it can do so\nwithout sacrificing main task performance; (c) that it sets a new\nstate-of-the-art performance in one task despite reducing the bias.

    "abstract": "The use of learning-based methods for vehicle behavior prediction is a\npromising research topic. However, many publicly available data sets suffer\nfrom class distribution skews which limits learning performance if not\naddressed. This paper proposes an interaction-aware prediction model consisting\nof an LSTM autoencoder and SVM classifier. Additionally, an imbalanced learning\ntechnique, the multiclass balancing ensemble is proposed. Evaluations show that\nthe method enhances model performance, resulting in improved classification\naccuracy. Good generalization properties of learned models are important and\ntherefore a generalization study is done where models are evaluated on unseen\ntraffic data with dissimilar traffic behavior stemming from different road\nconfigurations. This is realized by using two distinct highway traffic\nrecordings, the publicly available NGSIM US-101 and I80 data sets. Moreover,\nmethods for encoding structural and static features into the learning process\nfor improved generalization are evaluated. The resulting methods show\nsubstantial improvements in classification as well as generalization\nperformance.",

    "abstract": "As a low-cost and low-power-consumption passive reflector, intelligent\nreflecting surface (IRS) can make a significant rate improvement by building a\nprogrammable wireless environment. To improve the rate performance and coverage\nrange of wireless networks, an IRS-aided decode-and-forward (DF) relay network\nis proposed with multiple antennas at relay station (RS). To achieve a high\nrate, an alternately iterative structure (AIS) of maximizing receive power\n(Max-RP) at RS is proposed to jointly optimize the beamforming vectors at RS\nand phase shifts at IRS. Considering its high-complexity, two low-complexity\nMax-RP schemes of null-space projection (NSP) plus maximum ratio combining\n(MRC) and IRS element selection (IRSES) plus MRC are presented to reduce this\ncomplexity, respectively. For the former, NSP is used to separate the reflected\nsignal from IRS and the direct transmitted signal from source and MRC is\nadopted to combine the two signals at RS. For the latter, the basic concept of\nIRSES is as follows: IRS is partitioned into M subsets of elements and\nadjusting the phases of all elements per subset make all reflected signals and\nthe direct signal from source phase alignment (PA) at the corresponding antenna\nof relay. Simulation results show that the proposed three methods perform much\nbetter than the existing network with single-antenna relay in terms of rate\nperformance. In particular, a 85% rate gain over existing scheme is achieved in\nthe high signal-to-noise ratio region.",

Hutch++ combines randomized low-rank approximation in a\nfirst phase with stochastic trace estimation in a second phase.

In\nHutch++, the number of matrix-vector products is fixed a priori and distributed\nin a prescribed fashion among the two phases. In this work, we derive an\nadaptive variant of Hutch++, which outputs an estimate of the trace that is\nwithin some prescribed error tolerance with a controllable failure probability,\nwhile splitting the matrix-vector products in a near-optimal way among the two\nphases. For the special case of symmetric positive semi-definite matrix, we\npresent another variant of Hutch++, called Nystr\\\"om++, which utilizes the so\ncalled Nystr\\\"om approximation and requires only one pass over the matrix, as\ncompared to two passes with Hutch++.

VIA improves upon existing approaches for the automated\nanalysis of device interfaces in the following aspects: (i) support for\nvirtualization relevant buses, (ii) efficient Direct Memory Access (DMA)\nsupport and (iii) performance. VIA builds upon the Linux Kernel Library and\nclang's libfuzzer to fuzz the communication between the driver and the device\nvia MMIO, PIO, and DMA.

However how to\nextract such data into high value information without a time-consuming entire\ndataset reading by an operator is still a challenge. Moreover the analysis of\nacoustic imaging, due to its low signal-to-noise ratio, is a perfect training\nground for experimenting with new approaches, especially concerning Deep\nLearning techniques. We present hereby a novel approach that takes advantage of\nboth CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and classical CV (Computer Vision)\ntechniques, able to detect a generic class ''fish'' in acoustic video streams.\nThe pipeline pre-treats the acoustic images to extract 2 features, in order to\nlocalise the signals and improve the detection performances. To ensure the\nperformances from an ecological point of view, we propose also a two-step\nvalidation, one to validate the results of the trainings and one to test the\nmethod on a real-world scenario. The YOLOv3-based model was trained with data\nof fish from multiple species recorded by the two common acoustic cameras,\nDIDSON and ARIS, including species of high ecological interest, as Atlantic\nsalmon or European eels. The model we developed provides satisfying results\ndetecting almost 80% of fish and minimizing the false positive rate, however\nthe model is much less efficient for eel detections on ARIS videos. The first\nCNN pipeline for fish monitoring exploiting video data from two models of\nacoustic cameras satisfies most of the required features.

They model, however, only pairwise\nrelations between nodes and are not designed for encoding the higher-order\nrelations. This drawback is mitigated by hypergraphs, in which an edge can\nconnect an arbitrary number of nodes. Most hypergraph learning approaches\nconvert the hypergraph structure to that of a graph and then deploy existing\ngeometric deep learning methods. This transformation leads to information loss,\nand sub-optimal exploitation of the hypergraph's expressive power. We present\nHyperMSG, a novel hypergraph learning framework that uses a modular two-level\nneural message passing strategy to accurately and efficiently propagate\ninformation within each hyperedge and across the hyperedges. HyperMSG adapts to\nthe data and task by learning an attention weight associated with each node's\ndegree centrality. Such a mechanism quantifies both local and global importance\nof a node, capturing the structural properties of a hypergraph. HyperMSG is\ninductive, allowing inference on previously unseen nodes.

This ubiquitous representation is essentially a hybrid one that\ndecouples continuous vertex locations from the discrete topological\ntriangulation. Unfortunately, the combinatorial nature of the triangulation\nprevents taking derivatives over the space of possible meshings of any given\nsurface. As a result, to date, mesh processing and optimization techniques have\nbeen unable to truly take advantage of modular gradient descent components of\nmodern optimization frameworks. In this work, we present a differentiable\nsurface triangulation that enables optimization for any per-vertex or per-face\ndifferentiable objective function over the space of underlying surface\ntriangulations. Our method builds on the result that any 2D triangulation can\nbe achieved by a suitably perturbed weighted Delaunay triangulation. We\ntranslate this result into a computational algorithm by proposing a soft\nrelaxation of the classical weighted Delaunay triangulation and optimizing over\nvertex weights and vertex locations. We extend the algorithm to 3D by\ndecomposing shapes into developable sets and differentiably meshing each set\nwith suitable boundary constraints.

Besides rigorously studied $\\ell_p$-bounded additive\nperturbations, recently proposed semantic perturbations (e.g. rotation,\ntranslation) raise a serious concern on deploying ML systems in real-world.\nTherefore, it is important to provide provable guarantees for deep learning\nmodels against semantically meaningful input transformations. In this paper, we\npropose a new universal probabilistic certification approach based on\nChernoff-Cramer bounds that can be used in general attack settings. We estimate\nthe probability of a model to fail if the attack is sampled from a certain\ndistribution. Our theoretical findings are supported by experimental results on\ndifferent datasets.",

    "abstract": "With the recent surge in social applications relying on knowledge graphs, the\nneed for techniques to ensure fairness in KG based methods is becoming\nincreasingly evident. Previous works have demonstrated that KGs are prone to\nvarious social biases, and have proposed multiple methods for debiasing them.\nHowever, in such studies, the focus has been on debiasing techniques, while the\nrelations to be debiased are specified manually by the user. As manual\nspecification is itself susceptible to human cognitive bias, there is a need\nfor a system capable of quantifying and exposing biases, that can support more\ninformed decisions on what to debias. To address this gap in the literature, we\ndescribe a framework for identifying biases present in knowledge graph\nembeddings, based on numerical bias metrics. We illustrate the framework with\nthree different bias measures on the task of profession prediction, and it can\nbe flexibly extended to further bias definitions and applications. The\nrelations flagged as biased can then be handed to decision makers for judgement\nupon subsequent debiasing.",

    "abstract": "This document focuses on modeling a complex situations to achieve an\nadvantage within a competitive context. Our goal is to devise the\ncharacteristics of games to teach and exercise non-easily quantifiable tasks\ncrucial to the math-modeling process. A computerized game to exercise the\nmath-modeling process and optimization problem formulation is introduced. The\ngame is named The Formula 1 Championship, and models of the game were developed\nin the computerized simulation platform MoNet. It resembles some situations in\nwhich team managers must make crucial decisions to enhance their racing cars up\nto the feasible, most advantageous conditions. This paper describes the game's\nrules, limitations, and five Formula 1 circuit simulators used for the\nchampionship development. We present several formulations of this situation in\nthe form of optimization problems. Administering the budget to reach the best\ncar adjustment to a set of circuits to win the respective races can be an\napproach. Focusing on the best distribution of each Grand Prix's budget and\nthen deciding how to use the assigned money to improve the car is also the\nright approach. In general, there may be a degree of conflict among these\napproaches because they are different aspects of the same multi-scale\noptimization problem. Therefore, we evaluate the impact of assigning the\nhighest priority to an element, or another, when formulating the optimization\nproblem. Studying the effectiveness of solving such optimization problems turns\nout to be an exciting way of evaluating the advantages of focusing on one scale\nor another. Another thread of this research directs to the meaning of the game\nin the teaching-learning process. We believe applying the Formula 1 Game is an\neffective way to discover opportunities in a complex-system situation and\nformulate them to finally extract and concrete the related benefit to the\ncontext described.",

    "title": "A Quantitative Comparison of Epistemic Uncertainty Maps Applied to  Multi-Class Segmentation",
    "abstract": "Uncertainty assessment has gained rapid interest in medical image analysis. A\npopular technique to compute epistemic uncertainty is the Monte-Carlo (MC)\ndropout technique. From a network with MC dropout and a single input, multiple\noutputs can be sampled. Various methods can be used to obtain epistemic\nuncertainty maps from those multiple outputs. In the case of multi-class\nsegmentation, the number of methods is even larger as epistemic uncertainty can\nbe computed voxelwise per class or voxelwise per image. This paper highlights a\nsystematic approach to define and quantitatively compare those methods in two\ndifferent contexts: class-specific epistemic uncertainty maps (one value per\nimage, voxel and class) and combined epistemic uncertainty maps (one value per\nimage and voxel). We applied this quantitative analysis to a multi-class\nsegmentation of the carotid artery lumen and vessel wall, on a multi-center,\nmulti-scanner, multi-sequence dataset of (MR) images. We validated our analysis\nover 144 sets of hyperparameters of a model. Our main analysis considers the\nrelationship between the order of the voxels sorted according to their\nepistemic uncertainty values and the misclassification of the prediction. Under\nthis consideration, the comparison of combined uncertainty maps reveals that\nthe multi-class entropy and the multi-class mutual information statistically\nout-perform the other combined uncertainty maps under study. In a\nclass-specific scenario, the one-versus-all entropy statistically out-performs\nthe class-wise entropy, the class-wise variance and the one versus all mutual\ninformation. The class-wise entropy statistically out-performs the other\nclass-specific uncertainty maps in terms of calibration. We made a python\npackage available to reproduce our analysis on different data and tasks.",

Together with the continuously\nrising amount of available data, graphs therefore open up a wide range of\nmodeling capabilities for theoretical and real-world problems. However, the\nmodeling possibilities of graphs have not been fully exploited. One reason for\nthis is that there is neither an easily comprehensible overview of graph types\nnor an analysis of their modeling capacities available. As a result, neither\nthe potential of modeling with certain graph types is exhausted nor higher\nmodeling freedom and more efficient computing of graphs after transformation to\nanother graph type is in scope of view of many users. In order to clarify the\nmodeling possibilities of graphs, we order the different graph types, collate\ntheir memory complexity and provide an expressivity measure on them.\nFurthermore, we introduce transformation algorithms between the graph types\nfrom which equal expressivity of all graph types can be inferred, i.e., they\nare able to represent the same information or properties respectively.

Among the various types of aerial robots, blimps are very well suited to\nperform long-duration tasks while being energy efficient, relatively silent and\nsafe. To address the blimp navigation and control task, in our recent work, we\nhave developed a software-in-the-loop simulation and a PID-based controller for\nlarge blimps in the presence of wind disturbance. However, blimps have a\ndeformable structure and their dynamics are inherently non-linear and\ntime-delayed, often resulting in large trajectory tracking errors. Moreover,\nthe buoyancy of a blimp is constantly changing due to changes in the ambient\ntemperature and pressure. In the present paper, we explore a deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL) approach to address these issues. We train only in simulation,\nwhile keeping conditions as close as possible to the real-world scenario. We\nderive a compact state representation to reduce the training time and a\ndiscrete action space to enforce control smoothness.

While these dense retrievers enjoy substantial\nretrieval effectiveness improvements compared to sparse retrievers, they are\ncomputationally intensive, requiring substantial GPU resources, and dense\nretrievers are known to be more expensive from both time and resource\nperspectives. In addition, sparse retrievers have been shown to retrieve\ncomplementary information with respect to dense retrievers, leading to\nproposals for hybrid retrievers. These hybrid retrievers leverage low-cost,\nexact-matching based sparse retrievers along with dense retrievers to bridge\nthe semantic gaps between query and documents. In this work, we address this\ntrade-off between the cost and utility of sparse vs dense retrievers by\nproposing a classifier to select a suitable retrieval strategy (i.e., sparse\nvs. dense vs. hybrid) for individual queries. Leveraging sparse retrievers for\nqueries which can be answered with sparse retrievers decreases the number of\ncalls to GPUs. Consequently, while utility is maintained, query latency\ndecreases. Although we use less computational resources and spend less time, we\nstill achieve improved performance. Our classifier can select between sparse\nand dense retrieval strategies based on the query alone. We conduct experiments\non the MS MARCO passage dataset demonstrating an improved range of\nefficiency/effectiveness trade-offs between purely sparse, purely dense or\nhybrid retrieval strategies, allowing an appropriate strategy to be selected\nbased on a target latency and resource budget.",

    "abstract": "Lane change (LC) is one of the safety-critical manoeuvres in highway driving\naccording to various road accident records. Thus, reliably predicting such\nmanoeuvre in advance is critical for the safe and comfortable operation of\nautomated driving systems. The majority of previous studies rely on detecting a\nmanoeuvre that has been already started, rather than predicting the manoeuvre\nin advance. Furthermore, most of the previous works do not estimate the key\ntimings of the manoeuvre (e.g., crossing time), which can actually yield more\nuseful information for the decision making in the ego vehicle. To address these\nshortcomings, this paper proposes a novel multi-task model to simultaneously\nestimate the likelihood of LC manoeuvres and the time-to-lane-change (TTLC). In\nboth tasks, an attention-based convolutional neural network (CNN) is used as a\nshared feature extractor from a bird's eye view representation of the driving\nenvironment. The spatial attention used in the CNN model improves the feature\nextraction process by focusing on the most relevant areas of the surrounding\nenvironment. In addition, two novel curriculum learning schemes are employed to\ntrain the proposed approach. The extensive evaluation and comparative analysis\nof the proposed method in existing benchmark datasets show that the proposed\nmethod outperforms state-of-the-art LC prediction models, particularly\nconsidering long-term prediction performance.",

In this paper, we investigate an optimal operation problem of\nan HMES with the consideration of building thermal dynamics.

Due to the existence of uncertain parameters, inexplicit building thermal\ndynamics models, temporally coupled operational constraints related to three\nkinds of energy storage systems and indoor temperatures, as well as the\ncoupling between electric energy subsystems and thermal energy subsystems, it\nis challenging to solve the formulated problem.

    "abstract": "In recent years, the usage of indoor positioning systems for manufacturing\nprocesses became increasingly popular. Typically, the production hall is\nequipped with satellites which receive position data of sensors that can be\npinned on components, load carriers or industrial trucks. This enables a\ncompany e.g. to reduce search efforts and to optimize individual system\nprocesses. In our research context, a sensor only sends position information\nwhen it is moved. However, various circumstances frequently affect that data is\nundesirably sent, e.g. due to disrupting factors nearby. This has a negative\nimpact on the data quality, the energy consumption, and the reliability of the\nwhole system. Motivated by this, we aim to distinguish between actual movements\nand signals that were undesirably sent which is in particular challenging due\nto the susceptibility of indoor systems in terms of noise and measuring errors.\nTherefore, we propose two novel unsupervised classification algorithms suitable\nfor this task. Depending on the question of interest, they rely either on a\ndistance-based or on a time-based criterion, which allows to make use of all\nessential information. Furthermore, we propose an approach to combine both\nclassifications and to aggregate them on spatial production areas.

The magnitudes of these repulsive forces can be tuned to control\nthe relative importance assigned to collision avoidance with respect to the\nother phenomena affecting the agent's dynamics. We carried out numerical\nexperiments on a self-organising swarm of drones aimed at fighting wildfires\nautonomously. As expected, it has been found that the collision rate can be\nreduced either by decreasing the cruise speed of the agents and/or by\nincreasing the sampling frequency of the global signal strength field. A\nconvenient by-product of the proposed collision-avoidance algorithm is that it\nhelps maintain diversity in the swarm, thus enhancing exploration.",

However, generating exhaustive and\naccurate annotations is labor-intensive, challenging, and costly. Drawing only\ncoarse and approximate annotations is a much easier task, less costly, and it\nalleviates pathologists' workload. In this paper, we study the problem of\nrefining these approximate annotations in digital pathology to obtain more\naccurate ones. Some previous works have explored obtaining machine learning\nmodels from these inaccurate annotations, but few of them tackle the refinement\nproblem where the mislabeled regions should be explicitly identified and\ncorrected, and all of them require a - often very large - number of training\nsamples. We present a method, named Label Cleaning Multiple Instance Learning\n(LC-MIL), to refine coarse annotations on a single WSI without the need of\nexternal training data. Patches cropped from a WSI with inaccurate labels are\nprocessed jointly with a MIL framework, and a deep-attention mechanism is\nleveraged to discriminate mislabeled instances, mitigating their impact on the\npredictive model and refining the segmentation. Our experiments on a\nheterogeneous WSI set with breast cancer lymph node metastasis, liver cancer,\nand colorectal cancer samples show that LC-MIL significantly refines the coarse\nannotations, outperforming the state-of-the-art alternatives, even while\nlearning from a single slide.

    "abstract": "Several distributed system paradigms utilize Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs)\nto realize structured peer-to-peer (P2P) overlays. DHT structures arise as the\nmost commonly used organizations for peers that can efficiently perform crucial\nservices such as data storage, replication, query resolution, and load\nbalancing. With the advances in various distributed system technologies, novel\nand efficient solutions based on DHTs emerge and play critical roles in system\ndesign. DHT-based methods and communications have been proposed to address\nchallenges such as scalability, availability, reliability and performance, by\nconsidering unique characteristics of these technologies. In this article, we\npropose a classification of the state-of-the-art DHT-based methods focusing on\ntheir system architecture, communication, routing and technological aspects\nacross various system domains. To the best of our knowledge, there is no\ncomprehensive survey on DHT-based applications from system architecture and\ncommunication perspectives that spans various domains of recent distributed\nsystem technologies. We investigate the recently emerged DHT-based solutions in\nthe seven key domains of edge and fog computing, cloud computing, blockchain,\nthe Internet of Things (IoT), Online Social Networks (OSNs), Mobile Ad Hoc\nNetworks (MANETs), and Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs). In contrast to the\nexisting surveys, our study goes beyond the commonly known DHT methods such as\nstorage, routing, and lookup, and identifies diverse DHT-based solutions\nincluding but not limited to aggregation, task scheduling, resource management\nand discovery, clustering and group management, federation, data dependency\nmanagement, and data transmission. Furthermore, we identify open problems and\ndiscuss future research guidelines for each domain.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 virus has altered people's lives around the world, not only\nthrough the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) it causes, but also through\nunprecedented non-pharmaceutical interventions such as full-scale national\nlockdowns. Here we document population-wide shifts in dietary interests in 12\ncountries in 2020, as revealed through timeseries of Google search volumes. We\nfind that during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic there was an overall\nsurge in food interest, larger and longer-lasting than the surge during typical\nend-of-year holidays. The changes were strongly associated with population-wide\nmobility patterns. Using a quasi-experimental regression discontinuity design,\nwe estimate that the shock of decreased mobility manifested as a drastic\nincrease in interest in consuming food at home, with interest in recipes and\nrelated entities increasing by 90% on average across countries, and a\ncorresponding decrease in consuming food outside of home, with the interest in\nrestaurants decreasing by 54% on average. We find that, in addition to the\nvolume of searched foods, the nature of searched foods also changed. The most\ndrastic (up to threefold) increases occurred for calorie-dense\ncarbohydrate-based foods such as pastries, bakery products, bread, pies, and\ndesserts. In terms of the relative share (rather than absolute volume) of\nsearch interest, the most prominent increases occurred for carbohydrate-based\nfoods, whereas the share of interest in other food categories on average\nremained robust. The observed shifts in dietary interests have the potential to\naffect food consumption and health outcomes of people worldwide. These findings\ncan inform governmental and organizational decisions regarding measures to\nmitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on diet and nutrition, and thus\non population health.",

    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables learning control policies by\nutilizing only prior experience, without any online interaction. This can allow\nrobots to acquire generalizable skills from large and diverse datasets, without\nany costly or unsafe online data collection. Despite recent algorithmic\nadvances in offline RL, applying these methods to real-world problems has\nproven challenging. Although offline RL methods can learn from prior data,\nthere is no clear and well-understood process for making various design\nchoices, from model architecture to algorithm hyperparameters, without actually\nevaluating the learned policies online. In this paper, our aim is to develop a\npractical workflow for using offline RL analogous to the relatively\nwell-understood workflows for supervised learning problems. To this end, we\ndevise a set of metrics and conditions that can be tracked over the course of\noffline training, and can inform the practitioner about how the algorithm and\nmodel architecture should be adjusted to improve final performance. Our\nworkflow is derived from a conceptual understanding of the behavior of\nconservative offline RL algorithms and cross-validation in supervised learning.\nWe demonstrate the efficacy of this workflow in producing effective policies\nwithout any online tuning, both in several simulated robotic learning scenarios\nand for three tasks on two distinct real robots, focusing on learning\nmanipulation skills with raw image observations with sparse binary rewards.\nExplanatory video and additional results can be found at\nsites.google.com/view/offline-rl-workflow",

Knockoff\nsamples are independent of their output given the observed variables and\nexchangeable with their counterpart variables without changing the underlying\ndistribution of the data.

It remains an open question what strength\nof evidence positive reports of such studies actually yield. We focus on the\nextent to which positive reports indicate relation true in reality, that is, a\nprobabilistic assessment.\nAim. This study aims at establishing the overall strength of evidence in\ncyber security user studies, with the dimensions -- Positive Predictive Value\n(PPV) and its complement False Positive Risk (FPR), -- Likelihood Ratio (LR),\nand -- Reverse-Bayesian Prior (RBP) for a fixed tolerated False Positive Risk.\nMethod. Based on $431$ coded statistical inferences in $146$ cyber security\nuser studies from a published SLR covering the years 2006-2016, we first\ncompute a simulation of the a posteriori false positive risk based on assumed\nprior and bias thresholds. Second, we establish the observed likelihood ratios\nfor positive reports. Third, we compute the reverse Bayesian argument on the\nobserved positive reports by computing the prior required for a fixed a\nposteriori false positive rate.\nResults. We obtain a comprehensive analysis of the strength of evidence\nincluding an account of appropriate multiple comparison corrections. The\nsimulations show that even in face of well-controlled conditions and high prior\nlikelihoods, only few studies achieve good a posteriori probabilities.\nConclusions. Our work shows that the strength of evidence of the field is\nweak and that most positive reports are likely false. From this, we learn what\nto watch out for in studies to advance the knowledge of the field.",

    "abstract": "Backdoor attack introduces artificial vulnerabilities into the model by\npoisoning a subset of the training data via injecting triggers and modifying\nlabels. Various trigger design strategies have been explored to attack text\nclassifiers, however, defending such attacks remains an open problem. In this\nwork, we propose BFClass, a novel efficient backdoor-free training framework\nfor text classification. The backbone of BFClass is a pre-trained discriminator\nthat predicts whether each token in the corrupted input was replaced by a\nmasked language model. To identify triggers, we utilize this discriminator to\nlocate the most suspicious token from each training sample and then distill a\nconcise set by considering their association strengths with particular labels.\nTo recognize the poisoned subset, we examine the training samples with these\nidentified triggers as the most suspicious token, and check if removing the\ntrigger will change the poisoned model's prediction. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that BFClass can identify all the triggers, remove 95% poisoned\ntraining samples with very limited false alarms, and achieve almost the same\nperformance as the models trained on the benign training data.",

    "abstract": "Existing text classification methods mainly focus on a fixed label set,\nwhereas many real-world applications require extending to new fine-grained\nclasses as the number of samples per label increases. To accommodate such\nrequirements, we introduce a new problem called coarse-to-fine grained\nclassification, which aims to perform fine-grained classification on coarsely\nannotated data. Instead of asking for new fine-grained human annotations, we\nopt to leverage label surface names as the only human guidance and weave in\nrich pre-trained generative language models into the iterative weak supervision\nstrategy. Specifically, we first propose a label-conditioned finetuning\nformulation to attune these generators for our task. Furthermore, we devise a\nregularization objective based on the coarse-fine label constraints derived\nfrom our problem setting, giving us even further improvements over the prior\nformulation. Our framework uses the fine-tuned generative models to sample\npseudo-training data for training the classifier, and bootstraps on real\nunlabeled data for model refinement. Extensive experiments and case studies on\ntwo real-world datasets demonstrate superior performance over SOTA zero-shot\nclassification baselines.",

    "abstract": "Current Machine Translation (MT) systems achieve very good results on a\ngrowing variety of language pairs and datasets. However, they are known to\nproduce fluent translation outputs that can contain important meaning errors,\nthus undermining their reliability in practice. Quality Estimation (QE) is the\ntask of automatically assessing the performance of MT systems at test time.\nThus, in order to be useful, QE systems should be able to detect such errors.\nHowever, this ability is yet to be tested in the current evaluation practices,\nwhere QE systems are assessed only in terms of their correlation with human\njudgements. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing a general methodology\nfor adversarial testing of QE for MT. First, we show that despite a high\ncorrelation with human judgements achieved by the recent SOTA, certain types of\nmeaning errors are still problematic for QE to detect. Second, we show that on\naverage, the ability of a given model to discriminate between\nmeaning-preserving and meaning-altering perturbations is predictive of its\noverall performance, thus potentially allowing for comparing QE systems without\nrelying on manual quality annotation.",

We collect a\nlarge volume of demonstrations and comparisons from human labelers, and\nfine-tune GPT-3 using behavioral cloning and reward modeling to do\nsummarization recursively.

Our human labelers are able to supervise and\nevaluate the models quickly, despite not having read the entire books\nthemselves. Our resulting model generates sensible summaries of entire books,\neven matching the quality of human-written summaries in a few cases ($\\sim5\\%$\nof books).

A\nfundamental component of such networks, and a pivotal factor to the fulfillment\nof the target KPIs, is the virtual radio access network (vRAN), which allows\nhigh flexibility on the control of the radio link. However, to fully exploit\nthe potentiality of vRANs, an efficient mapping of the rapidly varying context\nto radio control decisions is not only essential, but also challenging owing to\nthe interdependence of user traffic demand, channel conditions, and resource\nallocation. Here, we propose CAREM, a reinforcement learning framework for\ndynamic radio resource allocation in heterogeneous vRANs, which selects the\nbest available link and transmission parameters for packet transfer, so as to\nmeet the KPI requirements. To show its effectiveness, we develop a testbed for\nproof-of-concept.

There are substantial challenges, however, in evaluating the\nquality of a solution provided by such inference techniques. One approach to\nsolution evaluation is to solve the non-Gaussian posteriors with a more\ncomputationally expensive but generally accurate approach to create a reference\nsolution for side-by-side comparison. Our work takes this direction. This paper\npresents nested sampling for factor graphs (NSFG), a nested-sampling-based\napproach for posterior estimation in non-Gaussian factor graph inference.\nAlthough NSFG applies to any problem modeled as inference over a factor graph,\nwe focus on providing reference solutions for evaluation of approximate\ninference approaches to SLAM problems. The sparsity structure of SLAM factor\ngraphs is exploited for improved computational performance without sacrificing\nsolution quality. We compare NSFG to two other sampling-based approaches, the\nNo-U-Turn sampler (NUTS) and sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), as well as GTSAM, a\nstate-of-the-art Gaussian SLAM solver. We evaluate across several synthetic\nexamples of interest to the non-Gaussian SLAM community, including multi-robot\nrange-only SLAM and range-only SLAM with ambiguous data associations.\nQuantitative and qualitative analyses show NSFG is capable of producing\nhigh-fidelity solutions to a wide range of non-Gaussian SLAM problems, with\nnotably superior solutions than NUTS and SMC.

To enable the deployment of\nemergent network applications (e.g., Vehicular networks, Internet of Things),\nexisting Traffic Engineering (TE) solutions must be able to achieve high\nperformance real-time network operation. In addition, TE solutions must be able\nto adapt to dynamic scenarios (e.g., changes in the traffic matrix or topology\nlink failures). However, current TE technologies rely on hand-crafted\nheuristics or computationally expensive solvers, which are not suitable for\nhighly dynamic TE scenarios.\nIn this paper we propose Enero, an efficient real-time TE engine. Enero is\nbased on a two-stage optimization process. In the first one, it leverages Deep\nReinforcement Learning (DRL) to optimize the routing configuration by\ngenerating a long-term TE strategy. We integrated a Graph Neural Network (GNN)\ninto the DRL agent to enable efficient TE on dynamic networks.

Ergo, informativeness is the prime attribute of document summary\ngenerated by an algorithm, and selecting sentences that capture the essence of\na document is the primary goal of extractive document summarization. In this\npaper, we employ Shannon entropy to capture informativeness of sentences. We\nemploy Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to reveal probability\ndistributions for computing entropy of terms, topics, and sentences in latent\nspace. We present an information theoretic interpretation of the computed\nentropy, which is the bedrock of the proposed E-Summ algorithm, an unsupervised\nmethod for extractive document summarization. The algorithm systematically\napplies information theoretic principle for selecting informative sentences\nfrom important topics in the document. The proposed algorithm is generic and\nfast, and hence amenable to use for summarization of documents in real time.\nFurthermore, it is domain-, collection-independent and agnostic to the language\nof the document. Benefiting from strictly positive NMF factor matrices, E-Summ\nalgorithm is transparent and explainable too. We use standard ROUGE toolkit for\nperformance evaluation of the proposed method on four well known public\ndata-sets. We also perform quantitative assessment of E-Summ summary quality by\ncomputing its semantic similarity w.r.t the original document.

Previous work\nhas developed data structures that trade off space usage for answering time and\nhas proved conditional space lower bounds for queries of practical interest\nsuch as the path and triangle query. However, most of these results cater to\nonly those queries, lack a comprehensive framework, and are not generalizable.\nThe isolated treatment of these queries also fails to utilize the connections\nwith extensive research on related problems within the database community. The\nkey insight in this work is to exploit the formalism of relational algebra by\ncasting the problems as answering join queries over a relational database.\nUsing the notion of boolean {\\em adorned queries} and {\\em access patterns}, we\npropose a unified framework that captures several widely studied algorithmic\nproblems. Our main contribution is three-fold. First, we present an algorithm\nthat recovers existing space-time tradeoffs for several problems.

We combine our data structure with {\\em query\ndecomposition} techniques to further improve the tradeoffs and show that it is\nreadily extensible to queries with negation. Second, we falsify two conjectures\nproposed in the existing literature that relates to the space-time lower bound\nfor path queries and triangle detection by proposing an unexpectedly better\nalgorithm. This result opens a new avenue for improving several algorithmic\nresults that have so far been assumed to be (conditionally) optimal.

    "abstract": "Mobile manipulators for indoor human environments can serve as versatile\ndevices that perform a variety of tasks, yet adoption of this technology has\nbeen limited. Reducing size, weight, and cost could facilitate adoption, but\nrisks restricting capabilities. We present a novel design that reduces size,\nweight, and cost, while still performing a variety of tasks. The core design\nconsists of a two-wheeled differential-drive mobile base, a lift, and a\ntelescoping arm configured to achieve Cartesian motion at the end of the arm.\nDesign extensions include a 1 degree-of-freedom (DOF) wrist to stow a tool, a\n2-DOF dexterous wrist to pitch and roll a tool, and a compliant gripper. We\njustify our design with mathematical models of static stability that relate the\nrobot's size and weight to its workspace, payload, and applied forces. We also\nprovide empirical support by teleoperating and autonomously controlling a\ncommercial robot based on our design (the Stretch RE1 from Hello Robot Inc.) to\nperform tasks in real homes.",

    "abstract": "State change comparison of multiple data items is often necessary in multiple\napplication domains, such as medical science, financial engineering, sociology,\nbiological science, etc. Slope graphs and grouped bar charts have been widely\nused to show a \"before-and-after\" story of different data states and indicate\ntheir changes. However, they visualize state changes as either slope or\ndifference of bars, which has been proved less effective for quantitative\ncomparison. Also, both visual designs suffer from visual clutter issues with an\nincreasing number of data items. In this paper, we propose Intercept Graph, a\nnovel visual design to facilitate effective interactive comparison of state\nchanges. Specifically, a radial design is proposed to visualize the starting\nand ending states of each data item and the line segment length explicitly\nencodes the \"state change\". By interactively adjusting the radius of the inner\ncircular axis, Intercept Graph can smoothly filter the large state changes and\nmagnify the difference between similar state changes, mitigating the visual\nclutter issues and enhancing the effective comparison of state changes. We\nconducted a case study through comparing Intercept Graph with slope graphs and\ngrouped bar charts on real datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of\nIntercept Graph.",

    "abstract": "A graph is an abstract model that represents relations among entities, for\nexample, the interactions between characters in a novel. A background story\nendows entities and relations with real-world meanings and describes the\nsemantics and context of the abstract model, for example, the actual story that\nthe novel presents. Considering practical experience and prior research, human\nviewers who are familiar with the background story of a graph and those who do\nnot know the background story may perceive the same graph differently. However,\nno previous research has adequately addressed this problem. This research paper\nthus presents an evaluation that investigated the effects of background stories\non graph perception. Three hypotheses that focused on the role of visual focus\nareas, graph structure identification, and mental model formation on graph\nperception were formulated and guided three controlled experiments that\nevaluated the hypotheses using real-world graphs with background stories. An\nanalysis of the resulting experimental data, which compared the performance of\nparticipants who read and did not read the background stories, obtained a set\nof instructive findings. First, having knowledge about a graph's background\nstory influences participants' focus areas during interactive graph\nexplorations. Second, such knowledge significantly affects one's ability to\nidentify community structures but not high degree and bridge structures. Third,\nthis knowledge influences graph recognition under blurred visual conditions.\nThese findings can bring new considerations to the design of storytelling\nvisualizations and interactive graph explorations.",

    "abstract": "Data in Knowledge Graphs often represents part of the current state of the\nreal world. Thus, to stay up-to-date the graph data needs to be updated\nfrequently. To utilize information from Knowledge Graphs, many state-of-the-art\nmachine learning approaches use embedding techniques. These techniques\ntypically compute an embedding, i.e., vector representations of the nodes as\ninput for the main machine learning algorithm. If a graph update occurs later\non -- specifically when nodes are added or removed -- the training has to be\ndone all over again. This is undesirable, because of the time it takes and also\nbecause downstream models which were trained with these embeddings have to be\nretrained if they change significantly. In this paper, we investigate embedding\nupdates that do not require full retraining and evaluate them in combination\nwith various embedding models on real dynamic Knowledge Graphs covering\nmultiple use cases. We study approaches that place newly appearing nodes\noptimally according to local information, but notice that this does not work\nwell. However, we find that if we continue the training of the old embedding,\ninterleaved with epochs during which we only optimize for the added and removed\nparts, we obtain good results in terms of typical metrics used in link\nprediction. This performance is obtained much faster than with a complete\nretraining and hence makes it possible to maintain embeddings for dynamic\nKnowledge Graphs.",

However, this algorithm was restricted to\nsingle-agent and small 2x2 multi-agent grid domains. In this work, we propose\nan extension to the original concept in order to solve more challenging\nproblems. Similar to classic DQNs, we add an experience replay buffer and use\ndifferent networks for approximating the target and policy values. The\nexperimental results show that learning becomes more stable and enables agents\nto find optimal policies in grid-domains with higher complexity. Additionally,\nwe assess how parameter sharing influences the agents behavior in multi-agent\ndomains.

As an online algorithm, POSL learns in real-time.\nPOSL can leverage a diversity of candidate algorithms, including online\nalgorithms with different training and update times, fixed algorithms that are\nnever updated during the procedure, pooled algorithms that learn from many\nindividuals' time-series, and individualized algorithms that learn from within\na single time-series. POSL's ensembling of this hybrid of base learning\nstrategies depends on the amount of data collected, the stationarity of the\ntime-series, and the mutual characteristics of a group of time-series. In\nessence, POSL decides whether to learn across samples, through time, or both,\nbased on the underlying (unknown) structure in the data. For a wide range of\nsimulations that reflect realistic forecasting scenarios, and in a medical data\napplication, we examine the performance of POSL relative to other current\nensembling and online learning methods.

    "abstract": "The analysis of electrical impulse phenomena in cardiac muscle tissue is\nimportant for the diagnosis of heart rhythm disorders and other cardiac\npathophysiology. Cardiac mapping techniques acquire numerous local temporal\nmeasurements and combine them to visualize the spread of electrophysiological\nwave phenomena across the heart surface. However, low spatial resolutions,\nsparse measurement locations, noise and other artifacts make it challenging to\naccurately visualize spatio-temporal activity. For instance, electro-anatomical\ncatheter mapping is severely limited by the sparsity of the measurements and\noptical mapping is prone to noise and motion artifacts. In the past, several\napproaches have been proposed to obtain more reliable maps from noisy or sparse\nmapping data. Here, we demonstrate that deep learning can be used to compute\nphase maps and detect phase singularities from both noisy and sparse electrical\nmapping data with high precision and efficiency. The self-supervised deep\nlearning approach is fundamentally different from classical phase mapping\ntechniques. Rather than encoding a phase signal from time-series data, the\nnetwork instead learns to directly associate short spatio-temporal sequences of\nelectrical data with phase maps and the positions of phase singularities. Using\nthis method, we were able to accurately compute phase maps and locate rotor\ncores even from extremely sparse and noisy data, generated from both optical\nmapping experiments and computer simulations. Neural networks are a promising\nalternative to conventional phase mapping and rotor core localization methods,\nthat could be used in optical mapping studies in basic cardiovascular research\nas well as in the clinical setting for the analysis of atrial fibrillation.",

    "title": "Sparse Uniformity Testing",
    "abstract": "In this paper we consider the uniformity testing problem for high-dimensional\ndiscrete distributions (multinomials) under sparse alternatives. More\nprecisely, we derive sharp detection thresholds for testing, based on $n$\nsamples, whether a discrete distribution supported on $d$ elements differs from\nthe uniform distribution only in $s$ (out of the $d$) coordinates and is\n$\\varepsilon$-far (in total variation distance) from uniformity. Our results\nreveal various interesting phase transitions which depend on the interplay of\nthe sample size $n$ and the signal strength $\\varepsilon$ with the dimension\n$d$ and the sparsity level $s$. For instance, if the sample size is less than a\nthreshold (which depends on $d$ and $s$), then all tests are asymptotically\npowerless, irrespective of the magnitude of the signal strength. On the other\nhand, if the sample size is above the threshold, then the detection boundary\nundergoes a further phase transition depending on the signal strength. Here, a\n$\\chi^2$-type test attains the detection boundary in the dense regime, whereas\nin the sparse regime a Bonferroni correction of two maximum-type tests and a\nversion of the Higher Criticism test is optimal up to sharp constants. These\nresults combined provide a complete description of the phase diagram for the\nsparse uniformity testing problem across all regimes of the parameters $n$,\n$d$, and $s$. One of the challenges in dealing with multinomials is that the\nparameters are always constrained to lie in the simplex. This results in the\naforementioned two-layered phase transition, a new phenomenon which does not\narise in classical high-dimensional sparse testing problems.",

    "abstract": "Granular jamming is a popular soft robotics technology that has seen recent\nwidespread applications including industrial gripping, surgical robotics and\nhaptics. However, to date the field has not fully exploited the fundamental\nscience of the jamming phase transition, which has been rigorously studied in\nthe field of statistical and condensed matter physics. This work introduces\nvibration as a means to improve the properties of granular jamming grippers\nthrough vibratory fluidisation and the exploitation of resonant modes within\nthe granular material. We show that vibration in soft jamming grippers can\nimprove holding strength, reduce the downwards force needed for the gripping\naction, and lead to a simplified setup where the second air pump, generally\nused for unjamming, could be removed. In a series of studies, we show that\nfrequency and amplitude of the waveforms are key determinants to performance,\nand that jamming performance is also dependent on temporal properties of the\ninduced waveform. We hope to encourage further study in transitioning\nfundamental jamming mechanisms into a soft robotics context to improve\nperformance and increase diversity of applications for granular jamming\ngrippers.",

    "abstract": "Optical neuroimaging is a vital tool for understanding the brain structure\nand the connection between regions and nuclei. However, the image noise\nintroduced in the sample preparation and the imaging system hinders the\nextraction of the possible knowlege from the dataset, thus denoising for the\noptical neuroimaging is usually necessary. The supervised denoisng methods\noften outperform the unsupervised ones, but the training of the supervised\ndenoising models needs the corresponding clean labels, which is not always\navaiable due to the high labeling cost. On the other hand, those semantic\nlabels, such as the located soma positions, the reconstructed neuronal fibers,\nand the nuclei segmentation result, are generally available and accumulated\nfrom everyday neuroscience research. This work connects a supervised denoising\nand a semantic segmentation model together to form a end-to-end model, which\ncan make use of the semantic labels while still provides a denoised image as an\nintermediate product. We use both the supervised and the self-supervised models\nfor the denoising and introduce a new cost term for the joint denoising and the\nsegmentation setup. We test the proposed approach on both the synthetic data\nand the real-world data, including the optical neuroimaing dataset and the\nelectron microscope dataset. The result shows that the joint denoising result\noutperforms the one using the denoising method alone and the joint model\nbenefits the segmentation and other downstream task as well.",

As such,\ntime-domain surveys such as Kepler, K2 and TESS will continue to play a\ncritical role as the first step in identifying candidate exomoon systems, which\nmay then be followed-up with premier ground- or space-based telescopes. In this\nwork, we train an ensemble of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify\ncandidate exomoon signals in single-transit events observed by Kepler. Our\ntraining set consists of ${\\sim}$27,000 examples of synthetic, planet-only and\nplanet+moon single transits, injected into Kepler light curves. We achieve up\nto 88\\% classification accuracy with individual CNN architectures and 97\\%\nprecision in identifying the moons in the validation set when the CNN ensemble\nis in total agreement. We then apply the CNN ensemble to light curves from 1880\nKepler Objects of Interest with periods $>10$ days ($\\sim$57,000 individual\ntransits), and further test the accuracy of the CNN classifier by injecting\nplanet transits into each light curve, thus quantifying the extent to which\nresidual stellar activity may result in false positive classifications. We find\na small fraction of these transits contain moon-like signals, though we caution\nagainst strong inferences of the exomoon occurrence rate from this result.

    "abstract": "Heat Equation Driven Area Coverage (HEDAC) is a state-of-the-art multi-agent\nergodic motion control guided by a gradient of a potential field. A finite\nelement method is hereby implemented to obtain a solution of Helmholtz partial\ndifferential equation, which models the potential field for surveying motion\ncontrol. This allows us to survey arbitrarily shaped domains and to include\nobstacles in an elegant and robust manner intrinsic to HEDAC's fundamental\nidea. For a simple kinematic motion, the obstacles and boundary avoidance\nconstraints are successfully handled by directing the agent motion with the\ngradient of the potential. However, including additional constraints, such as\nthe minimal clearance dsitance from stationary and moving obstacles and the\nminimal path curvature radius, requires further alternations of the control\nalgorithm. We introduce a relatively simple yet robust approach for handling\nthese constraints by formulating a straightforward optimization problem based\non collision-free escapes route maneuvers. This approach provides a guaranteed\ncollision avoidance mechanism, while being computationally inexpensive as a\nresult of the optimization problem partitioning. The proposed motion control is\nevaluated in three realistic surveying scenarios simulations, showing the\neffectiveness of the surveying and the robustness of the control algorithm.\nFurthermore, potential maneuvering difficulties due to improperly defined\nsurveying scenarios are highlighted and we provide guidelines on how to\noverpass them. The results are promising and indiacate real-world applicability\nof proposed constrained multi-agent motion control for autonomous surveying and\npotentially other HEDAC utilizations.",

In this work we provide a novel perspective on this\nphenomenon, decomposing the average likelihood into a KL divergence term and an\nentropy term. We argue that the latter can explain the curious OOD behaviour\nmentioned above, suppressing likelihood values on datasets with higher entropy.\nAlthough our idea is simple, we have not seen it explored yet in the\nliterature. This analysis provides further explanation for the success of OOD\ndetection methods based on likelihood ratios, as the problematic entropy term\ncancels out in expectation.

Furthermore, nearest-neighbor\ninterpolation is used to eliminate checkerboard artifacts which can appear in\nsequences encoded with DVC frameworks. Thanks to these two improvements, the\nperceptual quality of decoded sequences is improved.

This paper introduces a digital twin approach for adaptive\ntraffic signal control (ATSC) to improve a traveler's driving experience by\nreducing and redistributing waiting time at an intersection. While an ATSC\ncombined with a connected vehicle concept can reduce waiting time at an\nintersection and improve travel time in a signalized corridor, it is nearly\nimpossible to reduce traffic delay for congested traffic conditions. To remedy\nthis defect of the traditional ATCS with connected vehicle data, we have\ndeveloped a digital twin-based ATSC (DT-based ATSC) that considers the waiting\ntime of approaching vehicles towards a subject intersection along with the\nwaiting time of those vehicles at the immediate upstream intersection. We\nconducted a case study using a microscopic traffic simulation, Simulation of\nUrban Mobility (SUMO), by developing a digital replica of a roadway network\nwith signalized intersections in an urban setting where vehicle and traffic\nsignal data were collected in real-time. Our analyses reveal that the DT-based\nATSC outperforms the connected vehicle-based baseline ATSC in terms of average\ncumulative waiting time, distribution of drivers' waiting time, and level of\nservices for each approach for different traffic demands and therefore\ndemonstrates our method's superior efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Some response surface functions in complex engineering systems are usually\nhighly nonlinear, unformed, and expensive-to-evaluate. To tackle this\nchallenge, Bayesian optimization, which conducts sequential design via a\nposterior distribution over the objective function, is a critical method used\nto find the global optimum of black-box functions. Kernel functions play an\nimportant role in shaping the posterior distribution of the estimated function.\nThe widely used kernel function, e.g., radial basis function (RBF), is very\nvulnerable and susceptible to outliers; the existence of outliers is causing\nits Gaussian process surrogate model to be sporadic. In this paper, we propose\na robust kernel function, Asymmetric Elastic Net Radial Basis Function\n(AEN-RBF). Its validity as a kernel function and computational complexity are\nevaluated. When compared to the baseline RBF kernel, we prove theoretically\nthat AEN-RBF can realize smaller mean squared prediction error under mild\nconditions. The proposed AEN-RBF kernel function can also realize faster\nconvergence to the global optimum. We also show that the AEN-RBF kernel\nfunction is less sensitive to outliers, and hence improves the robustness of\nthe corresponding Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes. Through\nextensive evaluations carried out on synthetic and real-world optimization\nproblems, we show that AEN-RBF outperforms existing benchmark kernel functions.",
