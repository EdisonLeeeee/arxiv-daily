    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and lossless compression constitute two\nproblems that can be solved by the training of probabilistic models on a first\ndataset with subsequent likelihood evaluation on a second dataset, where data\ndistributions differ. By defining the generalization of probabilistic models in\nterms of likelihood we show that, in the case of image models, the OOD\ngeneralization ability is dominated by local features. This motivates our\nproposal of a Local Autoregressive model that exclusively models local image\nfeatures towards improving OOD performance. We apply the proposed model to OOD\ndetection tasks and achieve state-of-the-art unsupervised OOD detection\nperformance without the introduction of additional data. Additionally, we\nemploy our model to build a new lossless image compressor: NeLLoC (Neural Local\nLossless Compressor) and report state-of-the-art compression rates and model\nsize.",

    "abstract": "As developers program and debug, they continuously edit and run their code, a\nbehavior known as edit-run cycles. While techniques such as live programming\nare intended to support this behavior, little is known about the\ncharacteristics of edit-run cycles themselves. To bridge this gap, we analyzed\n28 hours of programming and debugging work from 11 professional developers\nwhich encompassed over three thousand development activities. We mapped\nactivities to edit or run steps, constructing 581 debugging and 207 programming\nedit-run cycles. We found that edit-run cycles are frequent. Developers edit\nand run the program, on average, 7 times before fixing a defect and twice\nbefore introducing a defect. Developers waited longer before again running the\nprogram when programming than debugging, with a mean cycle length of 3 minutes\nfor programming and 1 minute for debugging. Most cycles involved an edit to a\nsingle file after which a developer ran the program to observe the impact on\nthe final output. Edit-run cycles which included activities beyond edit and\nrun, such as navigating between files, consulting resources, or interacting\nwith other IDE features, were much longer, with a mean length of 5 minutes,\nrather than 1.5 minutes. We conclude with a discussion of design\nrecommendations for tools to enable more fluidity in edit-run cycles.",

    "abstract": "Annotated images are required for both supervised model training and\nevaluation in image classification. Manually annotating images is arduous and\nexpensive, especially for multi-labeled images. A recent trend for conducting\nsuch laboursome annotation tasks is through crowdsourcing, where images are\nannotated by volunteers or paid workers online (e.g., workers of Amazon\nMechanical Turk) from scratch. However, the quality of crowdsourcing image\nannotations cannot be guaranteed, and incompleteness and incorrectness are two\nmajor concerns for crowdsourcing annotations. To address such concerns, we have\na rethinking of crowdsourcing annotations: Our simple hypothesis is that if the\nannotators only partially annotate multi-label images with salient labels they\nare confident in, there will be fewer annotation errors and annotators will\nspend less time on uncertain labels. As a pleasant surprise, with the same\nannotation budget, we show a multi-label image classifier supervised by images\nwith salient annotations can outperform models supervised by fully annotated\nimages. Our method contributions are 2-fold: An active learning way is proposed\nto acquire salient labels for multi-label images; and a novel Adaptive\nTemperature Associated Model (ATAM) specifically using partial annotations is\nproposed for multi-label image classification. We conduct experiments on\npractical crowdsourcing data, the Open Street Map (OSM) dataset and benchmark\ndataset COCO 2014. When compared with state-of-the-art classification methods\ntrained on fully annotated images, the proposed ATAM can achieve higher\naccuracy. The proposed idea is promising for crowdsourcing data annotation. Our\ncode will be publicly available.",

    "abstract": "Surrogate models have several uses in engineering design, including speeding\nup design optimization, noise reduction, test measurement interpolation,\ngradient estimation, portability, and protection of intellectual property.\nTraditionally, surrogate models require that all training data conform to the\nsame parametrization (e.g. design variables), limiting design freedom and\nprohibiting the reuse of historical data. In response, this paper proposes\nGraph-based Surrogate Models (GSMs) for trusses. The GSM can accurately predict\ndisplacement fields from static loads given the structure's geometry as input,\nenabling training across multiple parametrizations. GSMs build upon recent\nadvancements in geometric deep learning which have led to the ability to learn\non undirected graphs: a natural representation for trusses. To further promote\nflexible surrogate models, the paper explores transfer learning within the\ncontext of engineering design, and demonstrates positive knowledge transfer\nacross data sets of different topologies, complexities, loads and applications,\nresulting in more flexible and data-efficient surrogate models for trusses.",

    "abstract": "Toxic comment classification models are often found biased toward identity\nterms which are terms characterizing a specific group of people such as\n\"Muslim\" and \"black\". Such bias is commonly reflected in false-positive\npredictions, i.e. non-toxic comments with identity terms. In this work, we\npropose a novel approach to tackle such bias in toxic comment classification,\nleveraging the notion of subjectivity level of a comment and the presence of\nidentity terms. We hypothesize that when a comment is made about a group of\npeople that is characterized by an identity term, the likelihood of that\ncomment being toxic is associated with the subjectivity level of the comment,\ni.e. the extent to which the comment conveys personal feelings and opinions.\nBuilding upon the BERT model, we propose a new structure that is able to\nleverage these features, and thoroughly evaluate our model on 4 datasets of\nvarying sizes and representing different social media platforms. The results\nshow that our model can consistently outperform BERT and a SOTA model devised\nto address identity term bias in a different way, with a maximum improvement in\nF1 of 2.43% and 1.91% respectively.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) has been the primary approach used in various computer\nvision tasks due to its relevant results achieved on many tasks. However, on\nreal-world scenarios with partially or no labeled data, DL methods are also\nprone to the well-known domain shift problem. Multi-source unsupervised domain\nadaptation (MSDA) aims at learning a predictor for an unlabeled domain by\nassigning weak knowledge from a bag of source models. However, most works\nconduct domain adaptation leveraging only the extracted features and reducing\ntheir domain shift from the perspective of loss function designs. In this\npaper, we argue that it is not sufficient to handle domain shift only based on\ndomain-level features, but it is also essential to align such information on\nthe feature space. Unlike previous works, we focus on the network design and\npropose to embed Multi-Source version of DomaIn Alignment Layers (MS-DIAL) at\ndifferent levels of the predictor. These layers are designed to match the\nfeature distributions between different domains and can be easily applied to\nvarious MSDA methods. To show the robustness of our approach, we conducted an\nextensive experimental evaluation considering two challenging scenarios: digit\nrecognition and object classification. The experimental results indicated that\nour approach can improve state-of-the-art MSDA methods, yielding relative gains\nof up to +30.64% on their classification accuracies.",

    "abstract": "In a cloud of m-dimensional data points, how would we spot, as well as rank,\nboth single-point- as well as group- anomalies? We are the first to generalize\nanomaly detection in two dimensions: The first dimension is that we handle both\npoint-anomalies, as well as group-anomalies, under a unified view -- we shall\nrefer to them as generalized anomalies. The second dimension is that gen2Out\nnot only detects, but also ranks, anomalies in suspiciousness order. Detection,\nand ranking, of anomalies has numerous applications: For example, in EEG\nrecordings of an epileptic patient, an anomaly may indicate a seizure; in\ncomputer network traffic data, it may signify a power failure, or a DoS/DDoS\nattack. We start by setting some reasonable axioms; surprisingly, none of the\nearlier methods pass all the axioms. Our main contribution is the gen2Out\nalgorithm, that has the following desirable properties: (a) Principled and\nSound anomaly scoring that obeys the axioms for detectors, (b) Doubly-general\nin that it detects, as well as ranks generalized anomaly -- both point- and\ngroup-anomalies, (c) Scalable, it is fast and scalable, linear on input size.\n(d) Effective, experiments on real-world epileptic recordings (200GB)\ndemonstrate effectiveness of gen2Out as confirmed by clinicians. Experiments on\n27 real-world benchmark datasets show that gen2Out detects ground truth groups,\nmatches or outperforms point-anomaly baseline algorithms on accuracy, with no\ncompetition for group-anomalies and requires about 2 minutes for 1 million data\npoints on a stock machine.",

In this paper, we\npropose an evaluation-focused framework to contextualize and compare a broad\nrange of visualization recommendation algorithms. We present the structure of\nour framework, where algorithms are specified using three components: (1) a\ngraph representing the full space of possible visualization designs, (2) the\nmethod used to traverse the graph for potential candidates for recommendation,\nand (3) an oracle used to rank candidate designs. To demonstrate how our\nframework guides the formal comparison of algorithmic performance, we not only\ntheoretically compare five existing representative recommendation algorithms,\nbut also empirically compare four new algorithms generated based on our\nfindings from the theoretical comparison. Our results show that these\nalgorithms behave similarly in terms of user performance, highlighting the need\nfor more rigorous formal comparisons of recommendation algorithms to further\nclarify their benefits in various analysis scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Existing road pothole detection approaches can be classified as computer\nvision-based or machine learning-based. The former approaches typically employ\n2-D image analysis/understanding or 3-D point cloud modeling and segmentation\nalgorithms to detect road potholes from vision sensor data. The latter\napproaches generally address road pothole detection using convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) in an end-to-end manner. However, road potholes are not\nnecessarily ubiquitous and it is challenging to prepare a large well-annotated\ndataset for CNN training. In this regard, while computer vision-based methods\nwere the mainstream research trend in the past decade, machine learning-based\nmethods were merely discussed. Recently, we published the first stereo\nvision-based road pothole detection dataset and a novel disparity\ntransformation algorithm, whereby the damaged and undamaged road areas can be\nhighly distinguished. However, there are no benchmarks currently available for\nstate-of-the-art (SoTA) CNNs trained using either disparity images or\ntransformed disparity images. Therefore, in this paper, we first discuss the\nSoTA CNNs designed for semantic segmentation and evaluate their performance for\nroad pothole detection with extensive experiments. Additionally, inspired by\ngraph neural network (GNN), we propose a novel CNN layer, referred to as graph\nattention layer (GAL), which can be easily deployed in any existing CNN to\noptimize image feature representations for semantic segmentation. Our\nexperiments compare GAL-DeepLabv3+, our best-performing implementation, with\nnine SoTA CNNs on three modalities of training data: RGB images, disparity\nimages, and transformed disparity images.

Advances in deep learning models relying\non Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) have achieved high performances in image\nclassification in the agricultural domain. Despite the success of this\narchitecture, CNN still faces many challenges such as high computation cost,\nthe need of large labelled datasets, ... Natural language processing's\ntransformer architecture can be an alternative approach to deal with CNN's\nlimitations. Making use of the self-attention paradigm, Vision Transformer\n(ViT) models can achieve competitive or better results without applying any\nconvolution operations. In this paper, we adopt the self-attention mechanism\nvia the ViT models for plant classification of weeds and crops: red beet,\noff-type beet (green leaves), parsley and spinach. Our experiments show that\nwith small set of labelled training data, ViT models perform better compared to\nstate-of-the-art CNN-based models EfficientNet and ResNet, with a top accuracy\nof 99.8\\% achieved by the ViT model.",

    "abstract": "Training deep neural networks is challenging when large and annotated\ndatasets are unavailable. Extensive manual annotation of data samples is\ntime-consuming, expensive, and error-prone, notably when it needs to be done by\nexperts. To address this issue, increased attention has been devoted to\ntechniques that propagate uncertain labels (also called pseudo labels) to large\namounts of unsupervised samples and use them for training the model. However,\nthese techniques still need hundreds of supervised samples per class in the\ntraining set and a validation set with extra supervised samples to tune the\nmodel. We improve a recent iterative pseudo-labeling technique, Deep Feature\nAnnotation (DeepFA), by selecting the most confident unsupervised samples to\niteratively train a deep neural network. Our confidence-based sampling strategy\nrelies on only dozens of annotated training samples per class with no\nvalidation set, considerably reducing user effort in data annotation. We first\nascertain the best configuration for the baseline -- a self-trained deep neural\nnetwork -- and then evaluate our confidence DeepFA for different confidence\nthresholds. Experiments on six datasets show that DeepFA already outperforms\nthe self-trained baseline, but confidence DeepFA can considerably outperform\nthe original DeepFA and the baseline.",

    "abstract": "Computation on ciphertexts of all known fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)\nschemes induces some noise, which, if too large, will destroy the plaintext.\nTherefore, the bootstrapping technique that re-encrypts a ciphertext and\nreduces the noise level remains the only known way of building FHE schemes for\narbitrary unbounded computations. The bootstrapping step is also the major\nefficiency bottleneck in current FHE schemes. A promising direction towards\nimproving concrete efficiency is to exploit the bootstrapping process to\nperform useful computation while reducing the noise at the same time.\nWe show a bootstrapping algorithm, which embeds a lookup table and evaluates\narbitrary functions of the plaintext while reducing the noise. Depending on the\nchoice of parameters, the resulting homomorphic encryption scheme may be either\nan exact FHE or homomorphic encryption for approximate arithmetic. Since we can\nevaluate arbitrary functions over the plaintext space, we can use the natural\nhomomorphism of Regev encryption to compute affine functions without\nbootstrapping almost for free. Consequently, our algorithms are particularly\nsuitable for circuits with many additions and scalar multiplication gates. We\nachieve record speeds for such circuits. For example, in the exact FHE setting,\nwe achieve a speedup of a factor of over 3000x over state-of-the-art methods.\nEffectively, we bring the evaluation time from weeks or days down to a few\nhours or minutes. Furthermore, we note that the speedup gets more significant\nwith the size of the affine function.\nWe provide a tight error analysis and show several parameter sets for our\nbootstrapping. Finally, we implement our algorithm and provide extensive tests.\nWe demonstrate our algorithms by evaluating different neural networks in\nseveral parameter and accuracy settings.",

Furthermore,\nour system performs significantly better than other baselines for both mention\nextraction and fine-grained IS classification in the end-to-end setting.\nFinally, we apply our system on BASHI (Roesiger, 2018) and SciCorp (Roesiger,\n2016) to recognize referential bridging anaphora.

Jitter\nreduction is required by some real-time applications; beyond this, dampers have\nthe potential to solve the burstiness cascade problem of deterministic networks\nin a scalable way, as they can be stateless. Dampers exist in several variants:\nsome apply only to earliest-deadline-first schedulers, whereas others can be\nassociated with any packet schedulers; some enforce FIFO ordering whereas some\nothers do not. Existing analyses of dampers are specific to some\nimplementations and some network configurations; also, they assume ideal,\nnon-realistic clocks. In this paper, we provide a taxonomy of all existing\ndampers in general network settings and analyze their timing properties in\npresence of non-ideal clocks. In particular, we give formulas for computing\nresidual jitter bounds of networks with dampers of any kind. We show that\nnon-FIFO dampers may cause reordering due to clock non-idealities and that the\ncombination of FIFO dampers with non-FIFO network elements may very negatively\naffect the performance bounds. Our results can be used to analyze timing\nproperties and burstiness increase in any time-sensitive network, as we\nillustrate on an industrial case-study.",

    "abstract": "Network traffic generators are invaluable tools that allow for applied\nexperimentation to evaluate the performance of networks, infrastructure, and\nsecurity controls, by modelling and simulating the communication packets and\npayloads that would be produced by machines and devices on the network.\nSpecifically for security applications, these tools can be used to consistently\nsimulate malicious activity on the network and test the components designed to\ndetect and mitigate malicious activities, in a highly reliable and customisable\nway. However, despite the promising features, most of these tools have some\nproblems that can undermine the correctness of experiments. The accuracy of the\nsimulation results depends strongly on the performance and reliability of the\nused generator. Thus, in this paper, we investigate the performance and\naccuracy of three of the most reviewed network traffic generators in\nliterature, namely Cisco TRex, Ostinato and Genesids. Mainly, the comparative\nexperiments examine the strengths and limitations of these tools, which can\nhelp the research community to choose the most suitable one to assess the\nperformance of their networks and security controls",

We parse the problem into three steps.\nFirst, the text in all frames is normalized to a frontal pose using a\nspatio-temporal trans-former network. Second, the text is replaced in a single\nreference frame using a state-of-art still-image text replacement method.\nFinally, the new text is transferred from the reference to remaining frames\nusing a novel learned image transformation network that captures lighting and\nblur effects in a temporally consistent manner. Results on synthetic and\nchallenging real videos show realistic text trans-fer, competitive quantitative\nand qualitative performance,and superior inference speed relative to\nalternatives.

    "abstract": "Humans can robustly recognize and localize objects by using visual and/or\nauditory cues. While machines are able to do the same with visual data already,\nless work has been done with sounds. This work develops an approach for scene\nunderstanding purely based on binaural sounds. The considered tasks include\npredicting the semantic masks of sound-making objects, the motion of\nsound-making objects, and the depth map of the scene. To this aim, we propose a\nnovel sensor setup and record a new audio-visual dataset of street scenes with\neight professional binaural microphones and a 360-degree camera. The\nco-existence of visual and audio cues is leveraged for supervision transfer. In\nparticular, we employ a cross-modal distillation framework that consists of\nmultiple vision teacher methods and a sound student method -- the student\nmethod is trained to generate the same results as the teacher methods do. This\nway, the auditory system can be trained without using human annotations. To\nfurther boost the performance, we propose another novel auxiliary task, coined\nSpatial Sound Super-Resolution, to increase the directional resolution of\nsounds. We then formulate the four tasks into one end-to-end trainable\nmulti-tasking network aiming to boost the overall performance. Experimental\nresults show that 1) our method achieves good results for all four tasks, 2)\nthe four tasks are mutually beneficial -- training them together achieves the\nbest performance, 3) the number and orientation of microphones are both\nimportant, and 4) features learned from the standard spectrogram and features\nobtained by the classic signal processing pipeline are complementary for\nauditory perception tasks.

    "abstract": "While deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in various\ncomputer vision tasks, they often fail to generalize to new domains and subtle\nvariations of input images. Several defenses have been proposed to improve the\nrobustness against these variations. However, current defenses can only\nwithstand the specific attack used in training, and the models often remain\nvulnerable to other input variations. Moreover, these methods often degrade\nperformance of the model on clean images and do not generalize to out-of-domain\nsamples. In this paper we present Generative Adversarial Training, an approach\nto simultaneously improve the model's generalization to the test set and\nout-of-domain samples as well as its robustness to unseen adversarial attacks.\nInstead of altering a low-level pre-defined aspect of images, we generate a\nspectrum of low-level, mid-level and high-level changes using generative models\nwith a disentangled latent space. Adversarial training with these examples\nenable the model to withstand a wide range of attacks by observing a variety of\ninput alterations during training.

    "abstract": "When sharing sensitive databases with other parties, a database owner aims to\n(i) have privacy guarantees for its shared database, (ii) have liability\nguarantees in case of unauthorized sharing of its database by the recipients,\nand (iii) provide a high quality (utility) database to the recipients. We\nobserve that sharing a database under differential privacy and database\nfingerprinting are orthogonal objectives. The former aims to inject noise into\na database to prevent inference of the original data values, whereas, the\nlatter aims to hide unique marks inside a database to trace malicious parties\nwho leak the data without the authorization. In this paper, we achieve these\ntwo objectives simultaneously by proposing a novel differentially-private\nfingerprinting mechanism for databases.\nSpecifically, we first devise a bit-level random response scheme to achieve\ndifferential privacy for sharing entire databases, and then, based on this, we\ndevelop an {\\epsilon}-differentially private fingerprinting mechanism. Next, we\ntheoretically analyze the relationships among differential privacy guarantee,\nfingerprint robustness, and database utility by deriving closed form\nexpressions to characterize the privacy-utility coupling and\nprivacy-fingerprint robustness coupling. Furthermore, we propose a sparse\nvector technique (SVT)-based solution to control the cumulative privacy loss\nwhen fingerprinted copies of a database are shared with multiple recipients. We\nexperimentally show that our mechanism achieves stronger fingerprint robustness\nthan the state-of-the-art fingerprinting mechanisms, and higher database\nutility than the simple composition of database perturbation under differential\nprivacy followed by fingerprinting (e.g., statistical utility of the shared\ndatabase by the proposed scheme is more than 10x higher than perturbation\nfollowed by fingerprinting).",

In particular, the service industry needs to allocate more\nmanpower, and it will be important for robots to support people. This study\nfocuses on using a humanoid robot as a social service robot to convey\ninformation in a shopping mall, and the robot's behavioral concepts were\nanalyzed. In order to convey the information, two processes must occur.\nPedestrians must stop in front of the robot, and the robot must continue the\nengagement with them. For the purpose of this study, three types of autonomous\nbehavioral concepts of the robot for the general use were analyzed and compared\nin these processes in the experiment: active, passive-negative, and\npassive-positive concepts. After interactions were attempted with 65,000+\npedestrians, this study revealed that the passive-negative concept can make\npedestrians stop more and stay longer. In order to evaluate the effectiveness\nof the robot in a real environment, the comparative results between three\nbehaviors and human advertisers revealed that (1) the results of the active and\npassive-positive concepts of the robot are comparable to those of the humans,\nand (2) the performance of the passive-negative concept is higher than that of\nall participants.

    "abstract": "An emerging trend in audio processing is capturing low-level speech\nrepresentations from raw waveforms. These representations have shown promising\nresults on a variety of tasks, such as speech recognition and speech\nseparation. Compared to handcrafted features, learning speech features via\nbackpropagation provides the model greater flexibility in how it represents\ndata for different tasks theoretically. However, results from empirical study\nshows that, in some tasks, such as voice spoof detection, handcrafted features\nare more competitive than learned features. Instead of evaluating handcrafted\nfeatures and raw waveforms independently, this paper proposes an Auxiliary\nRawnet model to complement handcrafted features with features learned from raw\nwaveforms. A key benefit of the approach is that it can improve accuracy at a\nrelatively low computational cost. The proposed Auxiliary Rawnet model is\ntested using the ASVspoof 2019 dataset and the results from this dataset\nindicate that a light-weight waveform encoder can potentially boost the\nperformance of handcrafted-features-based encoders in exchange for a small\namount of additional computational work.",

    "abstract": "Voice assistants, such as smart speakers, have exploded in popularity. It is\ncurrently estimated that the smart speaker adoption rate has exceeded 35% in\nthe US adult population. Manufacturers have integrated speaker identification\ntechnology, which attempts to determine the identity of the person speaking, to\nprovide personalized services to different members of the same family. Speaker\nidentification can also play an important role in controlling how the smart\nspeaker is used. For example, it is not critical to correctly identify the user\nwhen playing music. However, when reading the user's email out loud, it is\ncritical to correctly verify the speaker that making the request is the\nauthorized user. Speaker verification systems, which authenticate the speaker\nidentity, are therefore needed as a gatekeeper to protect against various\nspoofing attacks that aim to impersonate the enrolled user. This paper compares\npopular learnable front-ends which learn the representations of audio by joint\ntraining with downstream tasks (End-to-End). We categorize the front-ends by\ndefining two generic architectures and then analyze the filtering stages of\nboth types in terms of learning constraints. We propose replacing fixed\nfilterbanks with a learnable layer that can better adapt to anti-spoofing\ntasks. The proposed FastAudio front-end is then tested with two popular\nback-ends to measure the performance on the LA track of the ASVspoof 2019\ndataset.

    "abstract": "Pretrained contextualized representations offer great success for many\ndownstream tasks, including document ranking. The multilingual versions of such\npretrained representations provide a possibility of jointly learning many\nlanguages with the same model. Although it is expected to gain big with such\njoint training, in the case of cross lingual information retrieval (CLIR), the\nmodels under a multilingual setting are not achieving the same level of\nperformance as those under a monolingual setting. We hypothesize that the\nperformance drop is due to the translation gap between query and documents. In\nthe monolingual retrieval task, because of the same lexical inputs, it is\neasier for model to identify the query terms that occurred in documents.\nHowever, in the multilingual pretrained models that the words in different\nlanguages are projected into the same hyperspace, the model tends to translate\nquery terms into related terms, i.e., terms that appear in a similar context,\nin addition to or sometimes rather than synonyms in the target language. This\nproperty is creating difficulties for the model to connect terms that cooccur\nin both query and document. To address this issue, we propose a novel Mixed\nAttention Transformer (MAT) that incorporates external word level knowledge,\nsuch as a dictionary or translation table. We design a sandwich like\narchitecture to embed MAT into the recent transformer based deep neural models.\nBy encoding the translation knowledge into an attention matrix, the model with\nMAT is able to focus on the mutually translated words in the input sequence.\nExperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the external knowledge\nand the significant improvement of MAT embedded neural reranking model on CLIR\ntask.",

    "abstract": "A second-order accurate in time, positivity-preserving, and unconditionally\nenergy stable operator splitting numerical scheme is proposed and analyzed for\nthe system of reaction-diffusion equations with detailed balance. The scheme is\ndesigned based on an energetic variational formulation, in which the reaction\npart is reformulated in terms of the reaction trajectory, and both the reaction\nand diffusion parts dissipate the same free energy. At the reaction stage, the\nreaction trajectory equation is approximated by a second-order Crank-Nicolson\ntype method. The unique solvability, positivity-preserving, and\nenergy-stability are established based on a convexity analysis. In the\ndiffusion stage, an exact integrator is applied if the diffusion coefficients\nare constant, and a Crank-Nicolson type scheme is applied if the diffusion\nprocess becomes nonlinear. In either case, both the positivity-preserving\nproperty and energy stability could be theoretically established. Moreover, a\ncombination of the numerical algorithms at both stages by the Strang splitting\napproach leads to a second-order accurate, structure-preserving scheme for the\noriginal reaction-diffusion system. Numerical experiments are presented, which\ndemonstrate the accuracy of the proposed scheme.",

    "abstract": "Kinship verification is a long-standing research challenge in computer\nvision. The visual differences presented to the face have a significant effect\non the recognition capabilities of the kinship systems. We argue that\naggregating multiple visual knowledge can better describe the characteristics\nof the subject for precise kinship identification. Typically, the age-invariant\nfeatures can represent more natural facial details. Such age-related\ntransformations are essential for face recognition due to the biological\neffects of aging. However, the existing methods mainly focus on employing the\nsingle-view image features for kinship identification, while more meaningful\nvisual properties such as race and age are directly ignored in the feature\nlearning step. To this end, we propose a novel deep collaborative multi-modal\nlearning (DCML) to integrate the underlying information presented in facial\nproperties in an adaptive manner to strengthen the facial details for effective\nunsupervised kinship verification. Specifically, we construct a well-designed\nadaptive feature fusion mechanism, which can jointly leverage the complementary\nproperties from different visual perspectives to produce composite features and\ndraw greater attention to the most informative components of spatial feature\nmaps. Particularly, an adaptive weighting strategy is developed based on a\nnovel attention mechanism, which can enhance the dependencies between different\nproperties by decreasing the information redundancy in channels in a\nself-adaptive manner. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method,\nextensive experimental evaluations conducted on four widely-used datasets show\nthat our DCML method is always superior to some state-of-the-art kinship\nverification methods.",

Specifically, we take parents and children as\na whole to extract the expressive local and non-local features. Different from\nthe traditional works measuring similarity by distance, we interpolate the\nsimilarity calculations as the interior auxiliary weights into the deep CNN\narchitecture to learn the whole and natural features. These similarity weights\nnot only involve corresponding single points but also excavate the multiple\nrelationships cross points, where local and non-local features are calculated\nby using these two kinds of distance measurements. Importantly, instead of\nseparately conducting similarity computation and feature extraction, we\nintegrate similarity learning and feature extraction into one unified learning\nprocess. The integrated representations deduced from local and non-local\nfeatures can comprehensively express the informative semantics embedded in\nimages and preserve abundant correlation knowledge from image pairs.

Guruswami in 1997-1998.\nThere are general result about the Johnson radius and the list-decoding\ncapacity theorem for random codes. However few results about general\nconstraints on rates, list-decodable radius and list sizes for list-decodable\ncodes have been obtained. In this paper we show that rates, list-decodable\nradius and list sizes are closely related to the classical topic of covering\ncodes. We prove new simple but strong upper bounds for list-decodable codes\nbased on various covering codes. Then any good upper bound on the covering\nradius imply a good upper bound on the size of list-decodable codes. Hence the\nlist-decodablity of codes is a strong constraint from the view of covering\ncodes. Our covering code upper bounds for $(d,1)$ list decodable codes give\nhighly non-trivial upper bounds on the sizes of codes with the given minimum\nHamming distances. Our results give exponential improvements on the recent\ngeneralized Singleton upper bound of Shangguan and Tamo in STOC 2020, when the\ncode lengths are very large. The asymptotic forms of covering code bounds can\npartially recover the list-decoding capacity theorem, the Blinovsky bound and\nthe combinatorial bound of Guruswami-H{\\aa}stad-Sudan-Zuckerman.

Firstly, we propose a Dependency Maximization method based on the\nHilbert-Schmidt norm of the cross-covariance operator, which maximizes the\nstatistical dependency between the embedded feature of those unlabeled data and\ntheir label predictions, together with the supervised loss over the support\nset. We then use the obtained model to infer the pseudo-labels for those\nunlabeled data.

We iterate the above process until the pseudo-labels for the\nunlabeled data becomes stable.

    "abstract": "Multicast is an efficient way to realize one-to-many group communications in\nlarge-scale networks such as the Internet. However, the deployment of IP\nmulticast services over the Internet has not been as rapid as expected and\nneeded. Excepting the fatal defects in designing IPv4 address structure.\nAnother main reason that contributes to this slow deployment is the lack of\ncarrier-grade multicast-enabled switches and routers that can be as to scale as\ntheir unicast counterparts. Implementing a high-performance switch/router\nrelies on a polynomial-time group membership query algorithm within the Packet\nForwarding Engines (PFEs) to determine whether or not a packet is forwarded\nthrough an egress. Among these, Bloom filter (BF)-based and Residue Number\nSystem (RNS)-based are being considered as two representations of the\nmembership query algorithms. However, both approaches suffer from some fatal\nweaknesses such as space and time inefficiencies, especially for a\ncarrier-grade PFE with high port-density features. According to similar\nproperties of the prime theorem, we propose a simplified forwarding scheme in\nthis paper, named Per-Port Prime Filter Array (P3FA). The simulation results\nindicate that the P3FA can significantly improve space efficiencies under\nspecific lower egress-diversities conditions. Under the same space constraints,\ncompared with the SVRF, the multicast time efficiencies, the unicast time\nefficiency of the P3FA are respectively increased by 12x-17234x and 19x-2038x\nat a range of port-densities 16-1024, but at the expense of hardware cost,\nwhich increased by \\r{ho}/2x. A PFE designer that attempts to adopt P3FA should\ntrade-off between required performance and cost.",

    "abstract": "Few-shot classification (FSC) is one of the most concerned hot issues in\nrecent years. The general setting consists of two phases: (1) Pre-train a\nfeature extraction model (FEM) with base data (has large amounts of labeled\nsamples). (2) Use the FEM to extract the features of novel data (with few\nlabeled samples and totally different categories from base data), then classify\nthem with the to-be-designed classifier. The adaptability of pre-trained FEM to\nnovel data determines the accuracy of novel features, thereby affecting the\nfinal classification performances. To this end, how to appraise the pre-trained\nFEM is the most crucial focus in the FSC community. It sounds like traditional\nClass Activate Mapping (CAM) based methods can achieve this by overlaying\nweighted feature maps. However, due to the particularity of FSC (e.g., there is\nno backpropagation when using the pre-trained FEM to extract novel features),\nwe cannot activate the feature map with the novel classes. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a simple, flexible method, dubbed as Class-Irrelevant\nMapping (CIM). Specifically, first, we introduce dictionary learning theory and\nview the channels of the feature map as the bases in a dictionary. Then we\nutilize the feature map to fit the feature vector of an image to achieve the\ncorresponding channel weights. Finally, we overlap the weighted feature map for\nvisualization to appraise the ability of pre-trained FEM on novel data. For\nfair use of CIM in evaluating different models, we propose a new measurement\nindex, called Feature Localization Accuracy (FLA). In experiments, we first\ncompare our CIM with CAM in regular tasks and achieve outstanding performances.\nNext, we use our CIM to appraise several classical FSC frameworks without\nconsidering the classification results and discuss them.",

In doing so, the framework provides a simple tool for\ngoing beyond the \"What?\" and the \"Why?\" of medical AI ethics education, to\nanswer the \"How?\", giving universities, course directors, and/or professors a\nbroad road-map for equipping their students with the necessary clinical\nproficiency in medical AI.",

    "title": "Refining BERT Embeddings for Document Hashing via Mutual Information  Maximization",
    "abstract": "Existing unsupervised document hashing methods are mostly established on\ngenerative models. Due to the difficulties of capturing long dependency\nstructures, these methods rarely model the raw documents directly, but instead\nto model the features extracted from them (e.g. bag-of-words (BOW), TFIDF). In\nthis paper, we propose to learn hash codes from BERT embeddings after observing\ntheir tremendous successes on downstream tasks. As a first try, we modify\nexisting generative hashing models to accommodate the BERT embeddings. However,\nlittle improvement is observed over the codes learned from the old BOW or TFIDF\nfeatures. We attribute this to the reconstruction requirement in the generative\nhashing, which will enforce irrelevant information that is abundant in the BERT\nembeddings also compressed into the codes. To remedy this issue, a new\nunsupervised hashing paradigm is further proposed based on the mutual\ninformation (MI) maximization principle. Specifically, the method first\nconstructs appropriate global and local codes from the documents and then seeks\nto maximize their mutual information. Experimental results on three benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that the proposed method is able to generate hash codes\nthat outperform existing ones learned from BOW features by a substantial\nmargin.",

    "abstract": "Many real-world data can be represented as heterogeneous graphs with\ndifferent types of nodes and connections. Heterogeneous graph neural network\nmodel aims to embed nodes or subgraphs into low-dimensional vector space for\nvarious downstream tasks such as node classification, link prediction, etc.\nAlthough several models were proposed recently, they either only aggregate\ninformation from the same type of neighbors, or just indiscriminately treat\nhomogeneous and heterogeneous neighbors in the same way. Based on these\nobservations, we propose a new heterogeneous graph neural network model named\nHMSG to comprehensively capture structural, semantic and attribute information\nfrom both homogeneous and heterogeneous neighbors. Specifically, we first\ndecompose the heterogeneous graph into multiple metapath-based homogeneous and\nheterogeneous subgraphs, and each subgraph associates specific semantic and\nstructural information. Then message aggregation methods are applied to each\nsubgraph independently, so that information can be learned in a more targeted\nand efficient manner. Through a type-specific attribute transformation, node\nattributes can also be transferred among different types of nodes. Finally, we\nfuse information from subgraphs together to get the complete representation.\nExtensive experiments on several datasets for node classification, node\nclustering and link prediction tasks show that HMSG achieves the best\nperformance in all evaluation metrics than state-of-the-art baselines.",

    "abstract": "In complex systems, we often observe complex global behavior emerge from a\ncollection of agents interacting with each other in their environment, with\neach individual agent acting only on locally available information, without\nknowing the full picture. Such systems have inspired development of artificial\nintelligence algorithms in areas such as swarm optimization and cellular\nautomata. Motivated by the emergence of collective behavior from complex\ncellular systems, we build systems that feed each sensory input from the\nenvironment into distinct, but identical neural networks, each with no fixed\nrelationship with one another. We show that these sensory networks can be\ntrained to integrate information received locally, and through communication\nvia an attention mechanism, can collectively produce a globally coherent\npolicy. Moreover, the system can still perform its task even if the ordering of\nits inputs is randomly permuted several times during an episode. These\npermutation invariant systems also display useful robustness and generalization\nproperties that are broadly applicable.

We focus on Kyber (now in the Round-3 finalist of NIST PQC\nstandardization) and Aigis (a variant of Kyber proposed at PKC 2020).\nBy careful analysis, we first observe that the algorithmic design of Kyber\nand Aigis can be optimized by the mechanism of asymmetric key consensus with\nnoise (AKCN) proposed in \\cite{JZ16,JZ19}. Specifically, the decryption process\ncan be simplified with AKCN, leading to a both faster and less error-prone\ndecryption process. Moreover, the AKCN-based optimized version has perfect\ncompatibility with the deployment of Kyber/Aigis in reality, as they can run on\nthe same parameters, the same public key, and the same encryption process.\nWe make a systematic study of the variants of NTT proposed in recent years\nfor extending its applicability scope, make concrete analysis of their exact\ncomputational complexity, and in particular show their equivalence.

    "abstract": "Prescriptive process monitoring is a family of techniques to optimize the\nperformance of a business process by triggering interventions at runtime.\nExisting prescriptive process monitoring techniques assume that the number of\ninterventions that may be triggered is unbounded. In practice, though, specific\ninterventions consume resources with finite capacity. For example, in a loan\norigination process, an intervention may consist of preparing an alternative\nloan offer to increase the applicant's chances of taking a loan. This\nintervention requires a certain amount of time from a credit officer, and thus,\nit is not possible to trigger this intervention in all cases. This paper\nproposes a prescriptive process monitoring technique that triggers\ninterventions to optimize a cost function under fixed resource constraints. The\nproposed technique relies on predictive modeling to identify cases that are\nlikely to lead to a negative outcome, in combination with causal inference to\nestimate the effect of an intervention on the outcome of the case.

    "abstract": "Recent research into analog computing has introduced new notions of computing\nreal numbers. Huang, Klinge, Lathrop, Li, and Lutz defined a notion of\ncomputing real numbers in real-time with chemical reaction networks (CRNs),\nintroducing the classes $\\mathbb{R}_\\text{LCRN}$ (the class of all Lyapunov\nCRN-computable real numbers) and $\\mathbb{R}_\\text{RTCRN}$ (the class of all\nreal-time CRN-computable numbers).

However, their definition of real-time computation is\nfragile in the sense that it is sensitive to perturbations in initial\nconditions. To resolve this flaw, we further require a CRN to withstand these\nperturbations. In doing so, we arrive at a discrete model of memory. This\napproach has several benefits. First, a bounded CRN may compute values\napproximately in finite time. Second, a CRN can tolerate small perturbations of\nits species' concentrations. Third, taking a measurement of a CRN's state only\nrequires precision proportional to the exactness of these approximations.\nLastly, if a CRN requires only finite memory, this model and Turing machines\nare equivalent under real-time simulations.",

The general topology is further extended to a hierarchical recursive\ntopology with more medium links or short links to balance the reliability\nrequirements and the costs of physical network. We prove that the hypercube\ntopology has better partition tolerance than the regular rooted tree topology\nand the ring lattice topology, and effectively fits the upper-layer protocols.\nAs a result, blockchains constructed by the proposed topology can reach the CAP\nguarantee bound through adopting the proper transmission and the consensus\nprotocols protocols that have strong consistency and availability.",

In particular, by\nexploiting the simultaneously sparse and low-rank structure of mmW/THz channels\nwith spreads in the delay-angular domain, we propose two multi-rank aware JADCE\nalgorithms via applying the quotient geometry of product of complex rank-$L$\nmatrices with the number of clusters $L$.

    "abstract": "Speech-based machine learning (ML) has been heralded as a promising solution\nfor tracking prosodic and spectrotemporal patterns in real-life that are\nindicative of emotional changes, providing a valuable window into one's\ncognitive and mental state. Yet, the scarcity of labelled data in ambulatory\nstudies prevents the reliable training of ML models, which usually rely on\n\"data-hungry\" distribution-based learning. Leveraging the abundance of labelled\nspeech data from acted emotions, this paper proposes a few-shot learning\napproach for automatically recognizing emotion in spontaneous speech from a\nsmall number of labelled samples. Few-shot learning is implemented via a metric\nlearning approach through a siamese neural network, which models the relative\ndistance between samples rather than relying on learning absolute patterns of\nthe corresponding distributions of each emotion. Results indicate the\nfeasibility of the proposed metric learning in recognizing emotions from\nspontaneous speech in four datasets, even with a small amount of labelled\nsamples. They further demonstrate superior performance of the proposed metric\nlearning compared to commonly used adaptation methods, including network\nfine-tuning and adversarial learning. Findings from this work provide a\nfoundation for the ambulatory tracking of human emotion in spontaneous speech\ncontributing to the real-life assessment of mental health degradation.",

We propose a method\nfor effectively utilizing the sensor data in combination with the video data on\nthe basis of an attention mechanism that dynamically determines the modality\nthat requires more attention, taking the contextual information into account.\nWe compared the proposed sensor-fusion method with strong baselines on the MMAC\nCaptions dataset and found that using sensor data as supplementary information\nto the egocentric-video data was beneficial, and that our proposed method\noutperformed the strong baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of the\nproposed method.",

    "abstract": "Driving is an intuitive task that requires skills, constant alertness and\nvigilance for unexpected events. The driving task also requires long\nconcentration spans focusing on the entire task for prolonged periods, and\nsophisticated negotiation skills with other road users, including wild animals.\nThese requirements are particularly important when approaching intersections,\novertaking, giving way, merging, turning and while adhering to the vast body of\nroad rules. Modern motor vehicles now include an array of smart assistive and\nautonomous driving systems capable of subsuming some, most, or in limited\ncases, all of the driving task. The UK Department of Transport's response to\nthe Safe Use of Automated Lane Keeping System consultation proposes that these\nsystems are tested for compliance with relevant traffic rules. Building these\nsmart automotive systems requires software developers with highly technical\nsoftware engineering skills, and now a lawyer's in-depth knowledge of traffic\nlegislation as well. These skills are required to ensure the systems are able\nto safely perform their tasks while being observant of the law. This paper\npresents an approach for deconstructing the complicated legalese of traffic law\nand representing its requirements and flow. The approach (de)constructs road\nrules in legal terminology and specifies them in structured English logic that\nis expressed as Boolean logic for automation and Lawmaps for visualisation. We\ndemonstrate an example using these tools leading to the construction and\nvalidation of a Bayesian Network model. We strongly believe these tools to be\napproachable by programmers and the general public, and capable of use in\ndeveloping Artificial Intelligence to underpin motor vehicle smart systems, and\nin validation to ensure these systems are considerate of the law when making\ndecisions.",

    "abstract": "Modern cloud orchestrators like Kubernetes provide a versatile and robust way\nto host applications at scale. One of their key features is autoscaling, which\nautomatically adjusts cloud resources (compute, memory, storage) in order to\nadapt to the demands of applications. However, the scope of cloud autoscaling\nis limited to the datacenter hosting the cloud and it doesn't apply uniformly\nto the allocation of network resources. In I/O-constrained or data-in-motion\nuse cases this can lead to severe performance degradation for the application.\nFor example, when the load on a cloud service increases and the Wide Area\nNetwork (WAN) connecting the datacenter to the Internet becomes saturated, the\napplication flows experience an increase in delay and loss. In many cases this\nis dealt with overprovisioning network capacity, which introduces additional\ncosts and inefficiencies.\nOn the other hand, thanks to the concept of \"Network as Code\", the WAN\nexposes a set of APIs that can be used to dynamically allocate and de-allocate\ncapacity on-demand. In this paper we propose extending the concept of cloud\nautoscaling into the network to address this limitation. This way, applications\nrunning in the cloud can communicate their networking requirements, like\nbandwidth or traffic profile, to a Software-Defined Networking (SDN) controller\nor Network as a Service (NaaS) platform. Moreover, we aim to define the\nconcepts of vertical and horizontal autoscaling applied to networking. We\npresent a prototype that automatically allocates bandwidth to the underlay\nnetwork, according to the requirements of the applications hosted in\nKubernetes. Finally, we discuss open research challenges.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based single image deraining (SID) with unpaired information is\nof immense importance, as relying on paired synthetic data often limits their\ngenerality and scalability in real-world applications. However, we noticed that\ndirect employ of unpaired adversarial learning and cycle-consistency\nconstraints in the SID task is insufficient to learn the underlying\nrelationship from rainy input to clean outputs, since the domain knowledge\nbetween rainy and rain-free images is asymmetrical. To address such limitation,\nwe develop an effective unpaired SID method which explores mutual properties of\nthe unpaired exemplars by a contrastive learning manner in a GAN framework,\nnamed as CDR-GAN. The proposed method mainly consists of two cooperative\nbranches: Bidirectional Translation Branch (BTB) and Contrastive Guidance\nBranch (CGB). Specifically, BTB takes full advantage of the circulatory\narchitecture of adversarial consistency to exploit latent feature distributions\nand guide transfer ability between two domains by equipping it with\nbidirectional mapping. Simultaneously, CGB implicitly constrains the embeddings\nof different exemplars in rain space by encouraging the similar feature\ndistributions closer while pushing the dissimilar further away, in order to\nbetter help rain removal and image restoration. During training, we explore\nseveral loss functions to further constrain the proposed CDR-GAN.

However, when used in\nvideo inpainting that requires fine-grained representation, existed method\nstill suffers from yielding blurry edges in detail due to the hard patch\nsplitting. Here we aim to tackle this problem by proposing FuseFormer, a\nTransformer model designed for video inpainting via fine-grained feature fusion\nbased on novel Soft Split and Soft Composition operations. The soft split\ndivides feature map into many patches with given overlapping interval. On the\ncontrary, the soft composition operates by stitching different patches into a\nwhole feature map where pixels in overlapping regions are summed up. These two\nmodules are first used in tokenization before Transformer layers and\nde-tokenization after Transformer layers, for effective mapping between tokens\nand features. Therefore, sub-patch level information interaction is enabled for\nmore effective feature propagation between neighboring patches, resulting in\nsynthesizing vivid content for hole regions in videos. Moreover, in FuseFormer,\nwe elaborately insert the soft composition and soft split into the feed-forward\nnetwork, enabling the 1D linear layers to have the capability of modelling 2D\nstructure. And, the sub-patch level feature fusion ability is further enhanced.\nIn both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, our proposed FuseFormer\nsurpasses state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "The role of social media in opinion formation has far-reaching implications\nin all spheres of society. Though social media provide platforms for expressing\nnews and views, it is hard to control the quality of posts due to the sheer\nvolumes of posts on platforms like Twitter and Facebook. Misinformation and\nrumours have lasting effects on society, as they tend to influence people's\nopinions and also may motivate people to act irrationally. It is therefore very\nimportant to detect and remove rumours from these platforms. The only way to\nprevent the spread of rumours is through automatic detection and classification\nof social media posts. Our focus in this paper is the Twitter social medium, as\nit is relatively easy to collect data from Twitter. The majority of previous\nstudies used supervised learning approaches to classify rumours on Twitter.\nThese approaches rely on feature extraction to obtain both content and context\nfeatures from the text of tweets to distinguish rumours and non-rumours.\nManually extracting features however is time-consuming considering the volume\nof tweets. We propose a novel approach to deal with this problem by utilising\nsentence embedding using BERT to identify rumours on Twitter, rather than the\nusual feature extraction techniques. We use sentence embedding using BERT to\nrepresent each tweet's sentences into a vector according to the contextual\nmeaning of the tweet. We classify those vectors into rumours or non-rumours by\nusing various supervised learning techniques. Our BERT based models improved\nthe accuracy by approximately 10% as compared to previous methods.",

A fundamental part of such systems is\nthe sandbox that provides an instrumented and isolated environment (virtualized\nor emulated) for any user to upload and run unknown artifacts and identify\npotentially malicious behaviors. The provided API and the wealth of information\ninthe reports produced by these services have also helped attackers test the\nefficacy of numerous techniques to make malware hard to detect.The most common\ntechnique used by malware for evading the analysis system is to monitor the\nexecution environment, detect the presence of any debugging artifacts, and hide\nits malicious behavior if needed. This is usually achieved by looking for\nsignals suggesting that the execution environment does not belong to a the\nnative machine, such as specific memory patterns or behavioral traits of\ncertain CPU instructions.\nIn this paper, we show how an attacker can evade detection on such online\nservices by incorporating a Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm into a malware\nsample. Specifically, we leverage the asymptotic behavior of the computational\ncost of PoW algorithms when they run on some classes of hardware platforms to\neffectively detect a non bare-metal environment of the malware sandbox\nanalyzer. To prove the validity of this intuition, we design and implement the\nPOW-HOW framework, a tool to automatically implement sandbox detection\nstrategies and embed a test evasion program into an arbitrary malware sample.\nOur empirical evaluation shows that the proposed evasion technique is durable,\nhard to fingerprint, and reduces existing malware detection rate by a factor of\n10.

We show that multi-source\ntransformer models improve MT over standard transformer-base models even with\nempty lines provided as context, but the translation quality improves\nsignificantly (1.51 - 2.65 BLEU) when a sufficient amount of correct context is\nprovided.

The original\nidea is to change the velocity test functions in the discretization of\ntrilinear and right hand side terms by using an H(div)-conforming velocity\nreconstruction operator. In order to match the rotation form and error\nanalysis, a novel skew-symmetric discrete trilinear form containing the\nreconstruction operator is proposed, in which not only the velocity test\nfunction is changed. The corresponding well-posed discrete weak formulation\nstems straight from the classical inf-sup stable mixed conforming high-order\nfinite elements, and it is proven to achieve the pressure-independent velocity\nerrors. Optimal convergence rates of H1, L2-error for the velocity and L2-error\nfor the Bernoulli pressure are completely established.

Finally, we conduct extensive\nexperiments to demonstrate the advantages and properties of our proposed SAM.\nWe first show how SAM plays a primary role in the champion solution of two\nsubtasks of SemEval'21 Task 7.

In this study, we construct a refined IMU preintegration\nmodel that incorporates the Earth's rotation, and analytically compute the\ncovariance and Jacobian matrix. To mitigate the impact caused by sensors other\nthan IMU in the evaluation system, FGO-based GNSS/INS integration is adopted to\nquantitatively evaluate the accuracy of the refined preintegration. Compared to\na classic filtering-based GNSS/INS integration baseline, the employed FGO-based\nintegration using the refined preintegration yields the same accuracy. In\ncontrast, the existing rough preintegration yields significant accuracy\ndegradation. The performance difference between the refined and rough\npreintegration models can exceed 200% for an industrial-grade MEMS module and\n10% for a consumer-grade MEMS chip.

    "title": "Understanding Model Drift in a Large Cellular Network",
    "abstract": "Operational networks are increasingly using machine learning models for a\nvariety of tasks, including detecting anomalies, inferring application\nperformance, and forecasting demand. Accurate models are important, yet\naccuracy can degrade over time due to concept drift, whereby either the\ncharacteristics of the data change over time (data drift) or the relationship\nbetween the features and the target predictor change over time (model drift).\nDrift is important to detect because changes in properties of the underlying\ndata or relationships to the target prediction can require model retraining,\nwhich can be time-consuming and expensive. Concept drift occurs in operational\nnetworks for a variety of reasons, ranging from software upgrades to\nseasonality to changes in user behavior. Yet, despite the prevalence of drift\nin networks, its extent and effects on prediction accuracy have not been\nextensively studied. This paper presents an initial exploration into concept\ndrift in a large cellular network in the United States for a major metropolitan\narea in the context of demand forecasting. We find that concept drift arises\nlargely due to data drift, and it appears across different key performance\nindicators (KPIs), models, training set sizes, and time intervals. We identify\nthe sources of concept drift for the particular problem of forecasting downlink\nvolume. Weekly and seasonal patterns introduce both high and low-frequency\nmodel drift, while disasters and upgrades result in sudden drift due to\nexogenous shocks. Regions with high population density, lower traffic volumes,\nand higher speeds also tend to correlate with more concept drift. The features\nthat contribute most significantly to concept drift are User Equipment (UE)\ndownlink packets, UE uplink packets, and Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)\ntotal received packets.",

To solve\nthis issue, we propose a telework support system using spatial augmented\nreality technology. This system calibrates the space in which videos are\nprojected with real space and adjusts the spatial distance between users by\nchanging the position of projections. Users can switch the projection position\nof the video using hand-wave gestures. We also synchronize audio according to\ndistance to further emphasize the sense of space within the remote interaction:\nthe distance between projection position and user is inversely proportional to\nthe audio volume.

Our proposal aims at\ndynamically increasing the on-chip memory storage capacity of SRAM arrays\non-demand. The proposed scheme called - Augmented Memory Computing allows an\nSRAM cell to operate in two different modes 1) the Normal mode and 2) the\nAugmented mode. In the Normal mode of operation, the SRAM cell functions like a\nstandard 6 transistor (6T) SRAM cell, storing one bit of data in static format.\nWhile in the Augmented mode, each SRAM cell can store >1 bit of data (in a\ndynamic fashion). Specifically, we propose two novel SRAM cells - an 8\ntransistor (8T) dual bit storage augmented cell and a 7 transistor (7T) ternary\nbit storage augmented cell. The proposed 8T dual bit SRAM cell when operated in\nthe Augmented mode, can store a static bit of data while also, simultaneously,\nstoring another bit in a dynamic form. Thus, when operated in Augmented mode,\nthe 8T SRAM cell can store two bits of data - one SRAM-like data and one\nDRAM-like data, thereby increasing or augmenting the memory storage capacity.\nOn the other hand, the proposed 7T ternary bit storage augmented cell can\neither store a single SRAM data in Normal mode or can be configured to operate\nin Augmented mode, wherein it can store ternary data (3 levels (0,0), (0,1),\n(1,0)) in a dynamic manner.

The WCD is implemented via modular code on an off-the-shelf\nfield-programmable gate-array (FPGA, Intel/Altera Cyclone V), and incorporates\nboth time-to-digital converter (TDC) and digital storage oscilloscope (DSO)\nfunctionality. The device captures a waveform by taking snapshots of a signal\nas it propagates down an ultra-fast transmission line known as a carry chain\n(CC). It is calibrated via a novel dynamic phase-shifting (DPS) method that\nrequires substantially less data and resources than the state-of-the-art. Using\nDPS, we find the measurement resolution - or mean propagation delay from one CC\nelement to the next - to be 4.91 +/- 0.04 ps (4.54 +/- 0.02 ps) for a pulse of\nlogic high (low). Similarly, we find the single-shot precision - or mean error\non the timing of the waveform - to be 29.52 ps (27.14 ps) for pulses of logic\nhigh (low). We verify these findings by reproducing commercial oscilloscope\nmeasurements of asynchronous ring-oscillators on FPGAs, finding the mean pulse\nwidth to be 0.240 +/- 0.002 ns per inverter gate. Finally, we present a careful\nanalysis of design constraints, introduce a novel error correction algorithm,\nand sketch a simple extension to the analog domain.

    "abstract": "This paper puts forth a networking paradigm, referred to as just-in-time\n(JIT) communication, to support client-server applications with stringent\nrequest-response latency requirement. Of interest is not just the round-trip\ndelay of the network, but the actual request-response latency experienced by\nthe application. The JIT framework contains two salient features. At the client\nside, the communication layer will 'pull' a request from the client just when\nthere is an upcoming transmission opportunity from the network. This ensures\nthat the request contains information that is as fresh as possible (e.g., a\nsensor reading obtained just before the transmission opportunity). At the\nserver side, the network ascertains that the server, after receiving and\nprocessing the request to generate a response (e.g., a control command to be\nsent to the client), will have a transmission opportunity at just this time. We\nrealize the JIT system, including the protocol stack, over a\nTime-Division-Multiple-Access (TDMA) network implemented on a System-on-Chip\n(SoC) platform. We prove that a TDMA network with a power-of-2 time slots per\nsuperframe is optimal for realizing the server-side JIT function. Our\nexperimental results validate that JIT networks can yield significantly lower\nrequest-response latency than networks without JIT support can.",

    "abstract": "Math word problem (MWP) is a challenging and critical task in natural\nlanguage processing. Many recent studies formalize MWP as a generation task and\nhave adopted sequence-to-sequence models to transform problem descriptions to\nmathematical expressions. However, mathematical expressions are prone to minor\nmistakes while the generation objective does not explicitly handle such\nmistakes. To address this limitation, we devise a new ranking task for MWP and\npropose Generate & Rank, a multi-task framework based on a generative\npre-trained language model. By joint training with generation and ranking, the\nmodel learns from its own mistakes and is able to distinguish between correct\nand incorrect expressions. Meanwhile, we perform tree-based disturbance\nspecially designed for MWP and an online update to boost the ranker. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on the benchmark and the\nresults show that our method consistently outperforms baselines in all\ndatasets.

EHR data,\nsequential records of a patient's interactions with healthcare systems, has\nnumerous inherent characteristics of temporality, irregularity and data\ninsufficiency. Some recent works train healthcare predictive models by making\nuse of sequential information in EHR data, but they are vulnerable to\nirregular, temporal EHR data with the states of admission/discharge from\nhospital, and insufficient data.

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective framework that aims to transfer\nmeaningful information from a large teacher to a smaller student. Generally, KD\noften involves how to define and transfer knowledge. Previous KD methods often\nfocus on mining various forms of knowledge, for example, feature maps and\nrefined information. However, the knowledge is derived from the primary\nsupervised task and thus is highly task-specific. Motivated by the recent\nsuccess of self-supervised representation learning, we propose an auxiliary\nself-supervision augmented task to guide networks to learn more meaningful\nfeatures. Therefore, we can derive soft self-supervision augmented\ndistributions as richer dark knowledge from this task for KD. Unlike previous\nknowledge, this distribution encodes joint knowledge from supervised and\nself-supervised feature learning. Beyond knowledge exploration, another crucial\naspect is how to learn and distill our proposed knowledge effectively. To fully\ntake advantage of hierarchical feature maps, we propose to append several\nauxiliary branches at various hidden layers. Each auxiliary branch is guided to\nlearn self-supervision augmented task and distill this distribution from\nteacher to student. Thus we call our KD method as Hierarchical Self-Supervision\nAugmented Knowledge Distillation (HSSAKD). Experiments on standard image\nclassification show that both offline and online HSSAKD achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in the field of KD. Further transfer experiments\non object detection further verify that HSSAKD can guide the network to learn\nbetter features, which can be attributed to learn and distill an auxiliary\nself-supervision augmented task effectively.",

    "abstract": "Odometer has been proven to significantly improve the accuracy of the Global\nNavigation Satellite System / Inertial Navigation System (GNSS/INS) integrated\nvehicle navigation in GNSS-challenged environments. However, the odometer is\ninaccessible in many applications, especially for aftermarket devices. To apply\nforward speed aiding without hardware wheeled odometer, we propose OdoNet, an\nuntethered one-dimensional Convolution Neural Network (CNN)-based\npseudo-odometer model learning from a single Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU),\nwhich can act as an alternative to the wheeled odometer. Dedicated experiments\nhave been conducted to verify the feasibility and robustness of the OdoNet. The\nresults indicate that the IMU individuality, the vehicle loads, and the road\nconditions have little impact on the robustness and precision of the OdoNet,\nwhile the IMU biases and the mounting angles may notably ruin the OdoNet. Thus,\na data-cleaning procedure is added to effectively mitigate the impacts of the\nIMU biases and the mounting angles. Compared to the process using only\nnon-holonomic constraint (NHC), after employing the pseudo-odometer, the\npositioning error is reduced by around 68%, while the percentage is around 74%\nfor the hardware wheeled odometer. In conclusion, the proposed OdoNet can be\nemployed as an untethered pseudo-odometer for vehicle navigation, which can\nefficiently improve the accuracy and reliability of the positioning in\nGNSS-denied environments.",

    "abstract": "Many hardware structures in today's high-performance out-of-order processors\ndo not scale in an efficient way. To address this, different solutions have\nbeen proposed that build execution schedules in an energy-efficient manner.\nIssue time prediction processors are one such solution that use data-flow\ndependencies and predefined instruction latencies to predict issue times of\nrepeated instructions. In this work, we aim to improve their accuracy, and\nconsequently their performance, in an energy efficient way. We accomplish this\nby taking advantage of two key observations. First, memory accesses often take\nadditional time to arrive than the static, predefined access latency that is\nused to describe these systems. Second, we find that these memory access delays\noften repeat across iterations of the same code. This, in turn, allows us to\npredict the arrival time of these accesses.\nIn this work, we introduce a new processor microarchitecture, that replaces a\ncomplex reservation-station-based scheduler with an efficient, scalable\nalternative. Our proposed scheduling technique tracks real-time delays of loads\nto accurately predict instruction issue times, and uses a reordering mechanism\nto prioritize instructions based on that prediction, achieving\nclose-to-out-of-order processor performance. To accomplish this in an\nenergy-efficient manner we introduce: (1) an instruction delay learning\nmechanism that monitors repeated load instructions and learns their latest\ndelay, (2) an issue time predictor that uses learned delays and data-flow\ndependencies to predict instruction issue times and (3) priority queues that\nreorder instructions based on their issue time prediction. Together, our\nprocessor achieves 86.2% of the performance of a traditional out-of-order\nprocessor, higher than previous efficient scheduler proposals, while still\nconsuming 30% less power.",

We discuss the implications of our findings for the practice,\nresearch, and education of concurrent software development, and investigate the\nrelation of our findings with the findings of the previous work.\nResults: A few findings of our study are: (1) questions that concurrency\ndevelopers ask can be grouped into a hierarchy with 27 concurrency topics under\n8 major categories, (2) thread safety is among the most popular concurrency\ntopics and client-server concurrency is among the least popular, (3)\nirreproducible behavior is among the most difficult topics and memory\nconsistency is among the least difficult, (4) data scraping is among the most\npositive concurrency topics and irreproducible behavior is among the most\nnegative, (5) root cause identification has the most number of questions for\nusage of data race tools and alternative use has the least.\nConclusion: The results of our study can not only help concurrency developers\nbut also concurrency educators and researchers to better decide where to focus\ntheir efforts, by trading off one concurrency topic against another.",

    "title": "An Executable Structural Operational Formal Semantics for Python",
    "abstract": "Python is a popular high-level general-purpose programming language also\nheavily used by the scientific community. It supports a variety of different\nprogramming paradigms and is preferred by many for its ease of use. With the\nvision of harvesting static analysis techniques like abstract interpretation\nfor Python, we develop a formal semantics for Python. A formal semantics is an\nimportant cornerstone for any sound static analysis technique. We base our\nefforts on the general framework of structural operational semantics yielding a\nsmall-step semantics in principle allowing for concurrency and interaction with\nan environment. The main contributions of this thesis are twofold: first, we\ndevelop a meta-theoretic framework for the formalization of structural\noperational semantics in tandem with the necessary tool support for the\nautomated derivation of interpreters from such formal semantics, and, second,\nwe validate the suitability of this approach for the formalization of modern\nprogramming languages developing a semantics for Python.",

    "title": "Smart Traffic Monitoring System using Computer Vision and Edge Computing",
    "abstract": "Traffic management systems capture tremendous video data and leverage\nadvances in video processing to detect and monitor traffic incidents. The\ncollected data are traditionally forwarded to the traffic management center\n(TMC) for in-depth analysis and may thus exacerbate the network paths to the\nTMC. To alleviate such bottlenecks, we propose to utilize edge computing by\nequipping edge nodes that are close to cameras with computing resources (e.g.\ncloudlets). A cloudlet, with limited computing resources as compared to TMC,\nprovides limited video processing capabilities. In this paper, we focus on two\ncommon traffic monitoring tasks, congestion detection, and speed detection, and\npropose a two-tier edge computing based model that takes into account of both\nthe limited computing capability in cloudlets and the unstable network\ncondition to the TMC. Our solution utilizes two algorithms for each task, one\nimplemented at the edge and the other one at the TMC, which are designed with\nthe consideration of different computing resources. While the TMC provides\nstrong computation power, the video quality it receives depends on the\nunderlying network conditions. On the other hand, the edge processes very\nhigh-quality video but with limited computing resources. Our model captures\nthis trade-off. We evaluate the performance of the proposed two-tier model as\nwell as the traffic monitoring algorithms via test-bed experiments under\ndifferent weather as well as network conditions and show that our proposed\nhybrid edge-cloud solution outperforms both the cloud-only and edge-only\nsolutions.",

    "abstract": "For the market launch of automated vehicles, proof must be provided in\nadvance that they operate safely. However, the problem of how to validate their\nsafe operation remains unsolved. While scenario-based test approaches seem to\nbe possible solutions, they require the execution of a large number of test\ncases. Several test benches are available to execute these test cases, from\nactual test vehicles to partly or fully simulated environments. Each test bench\nprovides different elements, which, in turn, have different parameters and\nparameter ranges. The composition of elements with their specific parameter\nvalues on a specific test bench used to execute a test case is referred to as a\ntest bench configuration. However, selecting the most suitable test bench\nconfiguration is challenging. The selected test bench configuration determines\nthe actual performance of the test bench. Therefore, it determines whether the\nexecution of a specific test case provides sufficiently valid test case results\nwith respect to the intended purpose, for example, validating a vehicle's safe\noperation. The effective and efficient execution of a large number of test\ncases requires a method for systematically assigning test cases to the most\nsuitable test bench configuration. Based on a proposed method for classifying\ntest bench configurations, we propose and illustrate a method for\nsystematically assigning test cases to test bench configurations in a\nscenario-based test approach for automated vehicles. This assignment method\nallows for the effective and efficient execution of a large number of test\ncases while generating sufficiently valid test case results.",

As\nthe number of classes increases, such as in fine-grained visual categorization\n(FGVC), the amount of information conveyed by average accuracy alone dwindles.\nWhile its most glaring weakness is its failure to describe the model's\nperformance on a class-by-class basis, average accuracy also fails to describe\nhow performance may vary from one trained model of the same architecture, on\nthe same dataset, to another (both averaged across all categories and at the\nper-class level). We first demonstrate the magnitude of these variations across\nmodels and across class distributions based on attributes of the data,\ncomparing results on different visual domains and different per-class image\ndistributions, including long-tailed distributions and few-shot subsets. We\nthen analyze the impact various FGVC methods have on overall and per-class\nvariance. From this analysis, we both highlight the importance of reporting and\ncomparing methods based on information beyond overall accuracy, as well as\npoint out techniques that mitigate variance in FGVC results.",

It is well-known in the streaming code\nliterature, that diagonally embedding codewords of a $[\\tau+1,\\tau+1-a]$\nMaximum Distance Separable (MDS) code within the packet stream, leads to\nrate-optimal streaming codes capable of recovering from $a$ arbitrary packet\nerasures, under a strict decoding delay constraint $\\tau$. Thus MDS codes are\ngeared towards the efficient handling of the worst-case scenario corresponding\nto the occurrence of $a$ erasures. In the present paper, we have an increased\nfocus on the efficient handling of the most-frequent erasure patterns. We study\nstreaming codes which in addition to recovering from $a>1$ arbitrary packet\nerasures under a decoding delay $\\tau$, have the ability to handle the more\ncommon occurrence of a single-packet erasure, while incurring smaller delay\n$r<\\tau$. We term these codes as $(a,\\tau,r)$ locally recoverable streaming\ncodes (LRSCs), since our single-erasure recovery requirement is similar to the\nrequirement of locality in a coded distributed storage system. We characterize\nthe maximum possible rate of an LRSC by presenting rate-optimal constructions\nfor all possible parameters $\\{a,\\tau,r\\}$. Although the rate-optimal LRSC\nconstruction provided in this paper requires large field size, the construction\nis explicit. It is also shown that our $(a,\\tau=a(r+1)-1,r)$ LRSC construction\nprovides the additional guarantee of recovery from the erasure of $h, 1 \\leq h\n\\leq a$, packets, with delay $h(r+1)-1$.

We fine-tune a pretrained model using our\nsynthetic dataset and generate aspect-specific summaries by modifying the\naspect controllers. Experiments on two benchmarks show that our model\noutperforms the previous state of the art and generates personalized summaries\nby controlling the number of aspects discussed in them.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the problem about how to bid in repeated\ncontextual first price auctions. We consider a single bidder (learner) who\nrepeatedly bids in the first price auctions: at each time $t$, the learner\nobserves a context $x_t\\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ and decides the bid based on\nhistorical information and $x_t$. We assume a structured linear model of the\nmaximum bid of all the others $m_t = \\alpha_0\\cdot x_t + z_t$, where\n$\\alpha_0\\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ is unknown to the learner and $z_t$ is randomly\nsampled from a noise distribution $\\mathcal{F}$ with log-concave density\nfunction $f$. We consider both \\emph{binary feedback} (the learner can only\nobserve whether she wins or not) and \\emph{full information feedback} (the\nlearner can observe $m_t$) at the end of each time $t$. For binary feedback,\nwhen the noise distribution $\\mathcal{F}$ is known, we propose a bidding\nalgorithm, by using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method to achieve at\nmost $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{\\log(d) T})$ regret. Moreover, we generalize this\nalgorithm to the setting with binary feedback and the noise distribution is\nunknown but belongs to a parametrized family of distributions. For the full\ninformation feedback with \\emph{unknown} noise distribution, we provide an\nalgorithm that achieves regret at most $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{dT})$. Our approach\ncombines an estimator for log-concave density functions and then MLE method to\nlearn the noise distribution $\\mathcal{F}$ and linear weight $\\alpha_0$\nsimultaneously. We also provide a lower bound result such that any bidding\npolicy in a broad class must achieve regret at least $\\Omega(\\sqrt{T})$, even\nwhen the learner receives the full information feedback and $\\mathcal{F}$ is\nknown.",

Our method is built upon a deep co-training\nalgorithm, which consists of two neural networks: a message-pair classifier and\na session classifier.

For the message-pair classifier, we enrich its\ntraining data by retrieving message pairs with high confidence from the\ndisentangled sessions predicted by the session classifier.

Given the\nability to exploit long-term dependencies, transformers are promising to help\natypical convolutional neural networks (convnets) to overcome its inherent\nshortcomings of spatial inductive bias. However, most of recently proposed\ntransformer-based segmentation approaches simply treated transformers as\nassisted modules to help encode global context into convolutional\nrepresentations without investigating how to optimally combine self-attention\n(i.e., the core of transformers) with convolution. To address this issue, in\nthis paper, we introduce nnFormer (i.e., Not-aNother transFormer), a powerful\nsegmentation model with an interleaved architecture based on empirical\ncombination of self-attention and convolution. In practice, nnFormer learns\nvolumetric representations from 3D local volumes. Compared to the naive\nvoxel-level self-attention implementation, such volume-based operations help to\nreduce the computational complexity by approximate 98% and 99.5% on Synapse and\nACDC datasets, respectively. In comparison to prior-art network configurations,\nnnFormer achieves tremendous improvements over previous transformer-based\nmethods on two commonly used datasets Synapse and ACDC. For instance, nnFormer\noutperforms Swin-UNet by over 7 percents on Synapse. Even when compared to\nnnUNet, currently the best performing fully-convolutional medical segmentation\nnetwork, nnFormer still provides slightly better performance on Synapse and\nACDC.",

    "title": "Revisiting Recursive Least Squares for Training Deep Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Recursive least squares (RLS) algorithms were once widely used for training\nsmall-scale neural networks, due to their fast convergence. However, previous\nRLS algorithms are unsuitable for training deep neural networks (DNNs), since\nthey have high computational complexity and too many preconditions. In this\npaper, to overcome these drawbacks, we propose three novel RLS optimization\nalgorithms for training feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural\nnetworks and recurrent neural networks (including long short-term memory\nnetworks), by using the error backpropagation and our average-approximation RLS\nmethod, together with the equivalent gradients of the linear least squares loss\nfunction with respect to the linear outputs of hidden layers. Compared with\nprevious RLS optimization algorithms, our algorithms are simple and elegant.\nThey can be viewed as an improved stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm,\nwhich uses the inverse autocorrelation matrix of each layer as the adaptive\nlearning rate. Their time and space complexities are only several times those\nof SGD. They only require the loss function to be the mean squared error and\nthe activation function of the output layer to be invertible. In fact, our\nalgorithms can be also used in combination with other first-order optimization\nalgorithms without requiring these two preconditions. In addition, we present\ntwo improved methods for our algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate their\neffectiveness compared to the Adam algorithm on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and IMDB\ndatasets, and investigate the influences of their hyperparameters\nexperimentally.",

    "abstract": "Out of all existing frameworks for surgical workflow analysis in endoscopic\nvideos, action triplet recognition stands out as the only one aiming to provide\ntruly fine-grained and comprehensive information on surgical activities. This\ninformation, presented as <instrument, verb, target> combinations, is highly\nchallenging to be accurately identified. Triplet components can be difficult to\nrecognize individually; in this task, it requires not only performing\nrecognition simultaneously for all three triplet components, but also correctly\nestablishing the data association between them. To achieve this task, we\nintroduce our new model, the Rendezvous (RDV), which recognizes triplets\ndirectly from surgical videos by leveraging attention at two different levels.\nWe first introduce a new form of spatial attention to capture individual action\ntriplet components in a scene; called the Class Activation Guided Attention\nMechanism (CAGAM). This technique focuses on the recognition of verbs and\ntargets using activations resulting from instruments. To solve the association\nproblem, our RDV model adds a new form of semantic attention inspired by\nTransformer networks. Using multiple heads of cross and self attentions, RDV is\nable to effectively capture relationships between instruments, verbs, and\ntargets. We also introduce CholecT50 - a dataset of 50 endoscopic videos in\nwhich every frame has been annotated with labels from 100 triplet classes. Our\nproposed RDV model significantly improves the triplet prediction mAP by over 9%\ncompared to the state-of-the-art methods on this dataset.",

    "abstract": "Many existing works have made great strides towards reducing racial bias in\nface recognition. However, most of these methods attempt to rectify bias that\nmanifests in models during training instead of directly addressing a major\nsource of the bias, the dataset itself.

We demonstrate that these assumptions are not necessarily\nvalid.

We make the following\ncontributions. First, with careful examination on existing self-supervised\nlearning approaches, we reveal the surprising result that, given suitable data\naugmentation, models trained from scratch in fact achieve comparable\nperformance to those pre-trained with self-supervised learning. Second,\ninspired by the fact that tumors tend to be characterized independently to the\ncontexts, we propose a scalable pipeline for generating synthetic tumor data,\nand train a self-supervised model that minimises the generalisation gap with\nthe downstream task. Third, we conduct extensive ablation studies on different\ndownstream datasets, BraTS2018 for brain tumor segmentation and LiTS2017 for\nliver tumor segmentation. While evaluating the model transferability for tumor\nsegmentation under a low-annotation regime, including an extreme case of\nzero-shot segmentation, the proposed approach demonstrates state-of-the-art\nperformance, substantially outperforming all existing self-supervised\napproaches, and opening up the usage of self-supervised learning in practical\nscenarios.",

    "abstract": "Reducing traffic fatalities and serious injuries is a top priority of the US\nDepartment of Transportation. The computer vision (CV)-based crash anticipation\nin the near-crash phase is receiving growing attention. The ability to perceive\nfatal crash risks earlier is also critical because it will improve the\nreliability of crash anticipation. Yet, annotated image data for training a\nreliable AI model for the early visual perception of crash risks are not\nabundant. The Fatality Analysis Reporting System contains big data of fatal\ncrashes. It is a reliable data source for learning the relationship between\ndriving scene characteristics and fatal crashes to compensate for the\nlimitation of CV. Therefore, this paper develops a data analytics model, named\nscenario-wise, Spatio-temporal attention guidance, from fatal crash report\ndata, which can estimate the relevance of detected objects to fatal crashes\nfrom their environment and context information. First, the paper identifies\nfive sparse variables that allow for decomposing the 5-year fatal crash dataset\nto develop scenario-wise attention guidance. Then, exploratory analysis of\nlocation- and time-related variables of the crash report data suggests reducing\nfatal crashes to spatially defined groups. The group's temporal pattern is an\nindicator of the similarity of fatal crashes in the group. Hierarchical\nclustering and K-means clustering merge the spatially defined groups into six\nclusters according to the similarity of their temporal patterns. After that,\nassociation rule mining discovers the statistical relationship between the\ntemporal information of driving scenes with crash features, for each cluster.\nThe paper shows how the developed attention guidance supports the design and\nimplementation of a preliminary CV model that can identify objects of a\npossibility to involve in fatal crashes from their environment and context\ninformation.",

They highlight crucial\ninformation about the stress state and the spatio-temporal behavior of fault\nsystems during the earthquake cycle, therefore, its full characterization is\nthen crucial for improving earthquake hazard assessment. Modern DL algorithms\nalong with the increasing computational power are exploiting the continuously\ngrowing seismological databases, allowing scientists to improve the\ncompleteness for earthquake catalogs, systematically detecting smaller\nmagnitude earthquakes and reducing the errors introduced mainly by human\nintervention. In this work, we introduce OKSP, a novel automatic earthquake\ndetection pipeline for seismic monitoring in Costa Rica. Using Kabre\nsupercomputer from the Costa Rica High Technology Center, we applied OKSP to\nthe day before and the first 5 days following the Puerto Armuelles, M6.5,\nearthquake that occurred on 26 June, 2019, along the Costa Rica-Panama border\nand found 1100 more earthquakes previously unidentified by the Volcanological\nand Seismological Observatory of Costa Rica. From these events, a total of 23\nearthquakes with magnitudes below 1.0 occurred a day to hours prior to the\nmainshock, shedding light about the rupture initiation and earthquake\ninteraction leading to the occurrence of this productive seismic sequence. Our\nobservations show that for the study period, the model was 100% exhaustive and\n82% precise, resulting in an F1 score of 0.90. This effort represents the very\nfirst attempt for automatically detecting earthquakes in Costa Rica using deep\nlearning methods and demonstrates that, in the near future, earthquake\nmonitoring routines will be carried out entirely by AI algorithms.",

Besides, the selection of an appropriate cut-off for survival and\nthe presence of censored data create further problems. Application of deep\nlearning models for OS prediction is also limited due to the lack of large\nannotated publicly available datasets.

A cross validation strategy with grid search is proposed to\nsimultaneously select and evaluate the most predictive feature subset based on\nits predictive power.

    "title": "Besov Function Approximation and Binary Classification on  Low-Dimensional Manifolds Using Convolutional Residual Networks",
    "abstract": "Most of existing statistical theories on deep neural networks have sample\ncomplexities cursed by the data dimension and therefore cannot well explain the\nempirical success of deep learning on high-dimensional data. To bridge this\ngap, we propose to exploit low-dimensional geometric structures of the real\nworld data sets. We establish theoretical guarantees of convolutional residual\nnetworks (ConvResNet) in terms of function approximation and statistical\nestimation for binary classification. Specifically, given the data lying on a\n$d$-dimensional manifold isometrically embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^D$, we prove\nthat if the network architecture is properly chosen, ConvResNets can (1)\napproximate Besov functions on manifolds with arbitrary accuracy, and (2) learn\na classifier by minimizing the empirical logistic risk, which gives an excess\nrisk in the order of $n^{-\\frac{s}{2s+2(s\\vee d)}}$, where $s$ is a smoothness\nparameter. This implies that the sample complexity depends on the intrinsic\ndimension $d$, instead of the data dimension $D$. Our results demonstrate that\nConvResNets are adaptive to low-dimensional structures of data sets.",

    "abstract": "This report describes the submission of the DKU-DukeECE team to the\nself-supervision speaker verification task of the 2021 VoxCeleb Speaker\nRecognition Challenge (VoxSRC). Our method employs an iterative labeling\nframework to learn self-supervised speaker representation based on a deep\nneural network (DNN). The framework starts with training a self-supervision\nspeaker embedding network by maximizing agreement between different segments\nwithin an utterance via a contrastive loss. Taking advantage of DNN's ability\nto learn from data with label noise, we propose to cluster the speaker\nembedding obtained from the previous speaker network and use the subsequent\nclass assignments as pseudo labels to train a new DNN. Moreover, we iteratively\ntrain the speaker network with pseudo labels generated from the previous step\nto bootstrap the discriminative power of a DNN. Also, visual modal data is\nincorporated in this self-labeling framework. The visual pseudo label and the\naudio pseudo label are fused with a cluster ensemble algorithm to generate a\nrobust supervisory signal for representation learning. Our submission achieves\nan equal error rate (EER) of 5.58% and 5.59% on the challenge development and\ntest set, respectively.",

Remarkably, our QEnclave only performs single-qubit\nrotations, but can nevertheless be used to secure an arbitrary quantum\ncomputation even if the qubit source is controlled by an adversary. More\nprecisely, attaching a QEnclave to a quantum computer, a remote client\ncontrolling the QEnclave can securely delegate its computation to the server\nsolely using classical communication.

    "title": "Learning-Based Downlink Power Allocation in Cell-Free Massive MIMO  Systems",
    "abstract": "This paper considers a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output\n(MIMO) system that consists of a large number of geographically distributed\naccess points (APs) serving multiple users via coherent joint transmission. The\ndownlink performance of the system is evaluated, with maximum ratio and\nregularized zero-forcing precoding, under two optimization objectives for power\nallocation: sum spectral efficiency (SE) maximization and proportional\nfairness. We present iterative centralized algorithms for solving these\nproblems. Aiming at a less computationally complex and also distributed\nscalable solution, we train a deep neural network (DNN) to approximate the same\nnetwork-wide power allocation. Instead of training our DNN to mimic the actual\noptimization procedure, we use a heuristic power allocation, based on\nlarge-scale fading (LSF) parameters, as the pre-processed input to the DNN. We\ntrain the DNN to refine the heuristic scheme, thereby providing higher SE,\nusing only local information at each AP. Another distributed DNN that exploits\nside information assumed to be available at the central processing unit is\ndesigned for improved performance. Further, we develop a clustered DNN model\nwhere the LSF parameters of a small number of APs, forming a cluster within a\nrelatively large network, are used to jointly approximate the power\ncoefficients of the cluster.",

    "title": "Congruency-Constrained TU Problems Beyond the Bimodular Case",
    "abstract": "A long-standing open question in Integer Programming is whether integer\nprograms with constraint matrices with bounded subdeterminants are efficiently\nsolvable. An important special case thereof are congruency-constrained integer\nprograms $\\min\\{c^\\top x\\colon Tx\\leq b, \\gamma^\\top x\\equiv r\\pmod*{m},\nx\\in\\mathbb{Z}^n\\}$ with a totally unimodular constraint matrix $T$. Such\nproblems have been shown to be polynomial-time solvable for $m=2$, which led to\nan efficient algorithm for integer programs with bimodular constraint matrices,\ni.e., full-rank matrices whose $n\\times n$ subdeterminants are bounded by two\nin absolute value. Whereas these advances heavily relied on existing results on\nwell-known combinatorial problems with parity constraints, new approaches are\nneeded beyond the bimodular case, i.e., for $m>2$.\nWe make first progress in this direction through several new techniques. In\nparticular, we show how to efficiently decide feasibility of\ncongruency-constrained integer programs with a totally unimodular constraint\nmatrix for $m=3$. Furthermore, for general $m$, our techniques also allow for\nidentifying flat directions of infeasible problems, and deducing bounds on the\nproximity between solutions of the problem and its relaxation.",

    "title": "Routing Emergency Vehicles in Arterial Road Networks using Real-time  Mixed Criticality Systems*",
    "abstract": "Reducing the response time of Emergency Vehicles (EVs) has an undoubted\nadvantage in saving life and property. Implementing pre-emption can aid in\nachieving it. EVs get unobstructed movement via pre-emption, usually by\naltering traffic signals and giving a green wave throughout the route. This\napproach of absolute pre-emption effects adversely on regular traffic by\nimposing unnecessary waiting. In this paper, we propose a novel emergency\nvehicle pre-emption (EVP) algorithm implemented in the Vehicular Ad-hoc Network\n(VANET) that can reduce the imposed undesirable waiting time, but still\nascertains EVs meet target response time. We introduce mixed-criticality\nreal-time system scheduling concept where different level of emergencies is\nmapped with different criticality levels and assign certain success assurance\nlevel to respective criticality. We implemented the EVP algorithm for an\narterial traffic network and leveraged the use of valuable information that\ngets transmitted via VANET to make critical decisions. The proposed algorithm\ncan significantly reduce the average waiting time of regular traffic. It also\nascertains all EVs with different level of criticality meet target response\ntime respective to their assurance level.",

This 1) enables modular control design with global asymptotic\nstability, 2) such that both the control design and the stability analysis can\nbe performed locally at a subsystem level, 3) while avoiding an excessive\ngrowth of the control design complexity when the system order n increases. The\nlatter property makes the method suitable especially for high-dimensional\nsystems. We also design a smooth projection function for addressing system\nparametric uncertainties. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficiency of\nthe method.",
