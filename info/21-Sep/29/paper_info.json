    "abstract": "Transfer learning where the behavior of extracting transferable knowledge\nfrom the source domain(s) and reusing this knowledge to target domain has\nbecome a research area of great interest in the field of artificial\nintelligence. Probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) have been recognized as a\npowerful tool for modeling complex systems with many advantages, e.g., the\nability to handle uncertainty and possessing good interpretability. Considering\nthe success of these two aforementioned research areas, it seems natural to\napply PGMs to transfer learning. However, although there are already some\nexcellent PGMs specific to transfer learning in the literature, the potential\nof PGMs for this problem is still grossly underestimated. This paper aims to\nboost the development of PGMs for transfer learning by 1) examining the pilot\nstudies on PGMs specific to transfer learning, i.e., analyzing and summarizing\nthe existing mechanisms particularly designed for knowledge transfer; 2)\ndiscussing examples of real-world transfer problems where existing PGMs have\nbeen successfully applied; and 3) exploring several potential research\ndirections on transfer learning using PGM.",

    "abstract": "Accurate lake temperature estimation is essential for numerous problems\ntackled in both hydrological and ecological domains. Nowadays physical models\nare developed to estimate lake dynamics; however, computations needed for\naccurate estimation of lake surface temperature can get prohibitively\nexpensive. We propose to aggregate simulations of lake temperature at a certain\ndepth together with a range of meteorological features to probabilistically\nestimate lake surface temperature. Accordingly, we introduce a spatio-temporal\nneural network that combines Bayesian recurrent neural networks and Bayesian\ngraph convolutional neural networks. This work demonstrates that the proposed\ngraphical model can deliver homogeneously good performance covering the whole\nlake surface despite having sparse training data available. Quantitative\nresults are compared with a state-of-the-art Bayesian deep learning method.\nCode for the developed architectural layers, as well as demo scripts, are\navailable on https://renkulab.io/projects/das/bstnn.",

    "abstract": "Deep Learning models possess two key traits that, in combination, make their\nuse in the real world a risky prospect. One, they do not typically generalize\nwell outside of the distribution for which they were trained, and two, they\ntend to exhibit confident behavior regardless of whether or not they are\nproducing meaningful outputs. While Deep Learning possesses immense power to\nsolve realistic, high-dimensional problems, these traits in concert make it\ndifficult to have confidence in their real-world applications. To overcome this\ndifficulty, the task of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) Detection has been defined,\nto determine when a model has received an input from outside of the\ndistribution for which it is trained to operate.\nThis paper introduces and examines a novel methodology, DOODLER, for OOD\nDetection, which directly leverages the traits which result in its necessity.\nBy training a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) on the same data as another Deep\nLearning model, the VAE learns to accurately reconstruct In-Distribution (ID)\ninputs, but not to reconstruct OOD inputs, meaning that its failure state can\nbe used to perform OOD Detection. Unlike other work in the area, DOODLER\nrequires only very weak assumptions about the existence of an OOD dataset,\nallowing for more realistic application. DOODLER also enables pixel-wise\nsegmentations of input images by OOD likelihood, and experimental results show\nthat it matches or outperforms methodologies that operate under the same\nconstraints.",

    "abstract": "The design of widespread vision-and-language datasets and pre-trained\nencoders directly adopts, or draws inspiration from, the concepts and images of\nImageNet. While one can hardly overestimate how much this benchmark contributed\nto progress in computer vision, it is mostly derived from lexical databases and\nimage queries in English, resulting in source material with a North American or\nWestern European bias. Therefore, we devise a new protocol to construct an\nImageNet-style hierarchy representative of more languages and cultures. In\nparticular, we let the selection of both concepts and images be entirely driven\nby native speakers, rather than scraping them automatically. Specifically, we\nfocus on a typologically diverse set of languages, namely, Indonesian, Mandarin\nChinese, Swahili, Tamil, and Turkish. On top of the concepts and images\nobtained through this new protocol, we create a multilingual dataset for\n{M}ulticultur{a}l {R}easoning over {V}ision and {L}anguage (MaRVL) by eliciting\nstatements from native speaker annotators about pairs of images. The task\nconsists of discriminating whether each grounded statement is true or false.

However, most research in\njustice-centered approaches to equitable CS education focus on K-12 learning\nenvironments. In this position paper, we problematize the lack of attention to\njustice-centered approaches to CS in higher education and then describe a\njustice-centered approach for undergraduate Data Structures and Algorithms that\n(1) critiques sociopolitical values of data structure and algorithm design and\ndominant computing epistemologies that approach social good without design\njustice; (2) centers students in culturally responsive-sustaining pedagogies to\nresist dominant computing culture and value Indigenous ways of living in\nnature; and (3) ensures the rightful presence of political struggles through\nreauthoring rights and problematizing the political power of computing. Through\na case study of this Critical Comparative Data Structures and Algorithms\npedagogy, we argue that justice-centered approaches to higher CS education can\nhelp students not only critique the ethical implications of nominally technical\nconcepts, but also develop greater respect for diverse epistemologies,\ncultures, and narratives around computing that can help all of us realize the\nsocially-just worlds we need.",

    "abstract": "In the standard planar $k$-center clustering problem, one is given a set $P$\nof $n$ points in the plane, and the goal is to select $k$ center points, so as\nto minimize the maximum distance over points in $P$ to their nearest center.\nHere we initiate the systematic study of the clustering with neighborhoods\nproblem, which generalizes the $k$-center problem to allow the covered objects\nto be a set of general disjoint convex objects $\\mathscr{C}$ rather than just a\npoint set $P$. For this problem we first show that there is a PTAS for\napproximating the number of centers. Specifically, if $r_{opt}$ is the optimal\nradius for $k$ centers, then in $n^{O(1/\\varepsilon^2)}$ time we can produce a\nset of $(1+\\varepsilon)k$ centers with radius $\\leq r_{opt}$. If instead one\nconsiders the standard goal of approximating the optimal clustering radius,\nwhile keeping $k$ as a hard constraint, we show that the radius cannot be\napproximated within any factor in polynomial time unless $\\mathsf{P=NP}$, even\nwhen $\\mathscr{C}$ is a set of line segments. When $\\mathscr{C}$ is a set of\nunit disks we show the problem is hard to approximate within a factor of\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{13}-\\sqrt{3}}{2-\\sqrt{3}}\\approx 6.99$. This hardness result\ncomplements our main result, where we show that when the objects are disks, of\npossibly differing radii, there is a $(5+2\\sqrt{3})\\approx 8.46$ approximation\nalgorithm. Additionally, for unit disks we give an $O(n\\log\nk)+(k/\\varepsilon)^{O(k)}$ time $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximation to the optimal\nradius, that is, an FPTAS for constant $k$ whose running time depends only\nlinearly on $n$. Finally, we show that the one dimensional version of the\nproblem, even when intersections are allowed, can be solved exactly in $O(n\\log\nn)$ time.",

Therefore, previous work has developed methods to calibrate\nthe embedding space of transformers in order to ensure isotropy.

Crucially, existing methods that yield viable\nperformance necessitate the availability of laborious to obtain gloss sequence\ngroundtruth. In this paper, we attenuate this need, by introducing an\nend-to-end SLT model that does not entail explicit use of glosses; the model\nonly needs text groundtruth. This is in stark contrast to existing end-to-end\nmodels that use gloss sequence groundtruth, either in the form of a modality\nthat is recognized at an intermediate model stage, or in the form of a parallel\noutput process, jointly trained with the SLT model.

    "abstract": "The traditional master-slave teleoperation relies on human expertise without\ncorrection mechanisms, resulting in excessive physical and mental workloads. To\naddress these issues, a co-pilot-in-the-loop control framework is investigated\nfor cooperative teleoperation. A deep deterministic policy gradient(DDPG) based\nagent is realised to effectively restore the master operators' intents without\nprior knowledge on time delay. The proposed framework allows for introducing an\noperator (i.e., co-pilot) to generate commands at the slave side, whose weights\nare optimally assigned online through DDPG-based arbitration, thereby enhancing\nthe command robustness in the case of possible human operational errors. With\nthe help of interval type-2(IT2) Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy identification,\nforce feedback can be reconstructed at the master side without a sense of\ndelay, thus ensuring the telepresence performance in the force-sensor-free\nscenarios. Two experimental applications validate the effectiveness of the\nproposed framework.",

    "abstract": "This paper employs an audit bit based mechanism to mitigate the effect of\nByzantine attacks. In this framework, the optimal attacking strategy for\nintelligent attackers is investigated for the traditional audit bit based\nscheme (TAS) to evaluate the robustness of the system. We show that it is\npossible for an intelligent attacker to degrade the performance of TAS to the\nsystem without audit bits. To enhance the robustness of the system in the\npresence of intelligent attackers, we propose an enhanced audit bit based\nscheme (EAS). The optimal fusion rule for the proposed scheme is derived and\nthe detection performance of the system is evaluated via the probability of\nerror for the system. Simulation results show that the proposed EAS improves\nthe robustness and the detection performance of the system. Moreover, based on\nEAS, another new scheme called the reduced audit bit based scheme (RAS) is\nproposed which further improves system performance. We derive the new optimal\nfusion rule and the simulation results show that RAS outperforms EAS and TAS in\nterms of both robustness and detection performance of the system. Then, we\nextend the proposed RAS for a wide-area cluster based distributed wireless\nsensor networks (CWSNs). Simulation results show that the proposed RAS\nsignificantly reduces the communication overhead between the sensors and the\nFC, which prolongs the lifetime of the network.",

In this work, we propose\nan approach that decomposes the given problem into two stages: motion planning\nand motion imitation.

Once the motion plan is obtained,\nthe motion imitation stage learns a control policy that can imitate the given\nmotion plan with realistic sensors and actuations.

The analysis reveals that chances of failure\nto summit due to fatigue, altitude or logistical problems, drastically reduce\nwhen climbing with repeat partners, especially for experienced climbers.\nAdditionally, node-centrality indicates that individual traits of youth and\noxygen use are the strongest drivers of success. Further, the learning of\nnetwork projections enables computation of correlations between\nintra-expedition networks and corresponding expedition success rates. Of\nexpedition-wide factors, the expedition size and length layers are found to be\nstrongly correlated with success rate.

More specifically, we\npropose to learn non-linear warpings on the latent space, each one parametrized\nby a set of RBF-based latent space warping functions, and where each warping\ngives rise to a family of non-linear paths via the gradient of the function.\nBuilding on the work of Voynov and Babenko, that discovers linear paths, we\noptimize the trainable parameters of the set of RBFs, so as that images that\nare generated by codes along different paths, are easily distinguishable by a\ndiscriminator network. This leads to easily distinguishable image\ntransformations, such as pose and facial expressions in facial images. We show\nthat linear paths can be derived as a special case of our method, and show\nexperimentally that non-linear paths in the latent space lead to steeper, more\ndisentangled and interpretable changes in the image space than in state-of-the\nart methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

This\nsignificantly reduces the number of hyper-parameters compared to existing\nmethods. We also provide theoretical justifications on the approximation power\nof Lyapunov-Net and its complexity bounds. We demonstrate the efficiency of the\nproposed method on nonlinear dynamical systems involving up to 30-dimensional\nstate spaces, and show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

It extends the traditional\nGAN framework with inference by rewriting the adversarial strategy in both the\nimage and the latent space with an entangled game between data-latent encoded\nposteriors and priors. It brings a measurable stability and convergence to the\nclassical GAN scheme, while keeping its generative quality and remaining simple\nand frugal in order to run on a lab PC. IGAN fosters the encoded latents to\nspan the full prior space: this enables the exploitation of an enlarged and\nself-organised latent space in an unsupervised manner. An analysis of\npreviously published articles sets the theoretical ground for the proposed\nalgorithm.

Although the on-road vehicle emission\nprediction is a widely researched topic, construction equipment emission\nmeasurement and reduction have received very little attention. This paper\ndescribes the development and deployment of a novel framework that uses machine\nlearning (ML) methods to predict the level of emissions from heavy construction\nequipment monitored via an Internet of Things (IoT) system comprised of\naccelerometer and gyroscope sensors. The developed framework was validated\nusing an excavator performing real-world construction work. A portable emission\nmeasurement system (PEMS) was employed along with the inertial sensors to\nrecord data including the amount of CO, NOX, CO2, SO2, and CH4 pollutions\nemitted by the equipment. Different ML algorithms were developed and compared\nto identify the best model to predict emission levels from inertial sensors\ndata.

The memoryless semantic {representation layer} broadcasts information.\nIn cognitive neuroscience, it would be the \"mental canvas\", or the \"global\nworkspace\" and reflects the cognitive brain state. The symbolic {index layer}\nrepresents concepts and past episodes, whose semantic embeddings are\nimplemented in the connection weights between both layers.

Episodic\nmemory stores and retrieves past observations and provides provenance and\ncontext. Recent episodic memory enriches perception by the retrieval of\nperceptual experiences, which provide the agent with a sense about the here and\nnow: to understand its own state, and the world's semantic state in general,\nthe agent needs to know what happened recently, in recent scenes, and on\nrecently perceived entities.

    "abstract": "Robot learning holds the promise of learning policies that generalize\nbroadly. However, such generalization requires sufficiently diverse datasets of\nthe task of interest, which can be prohibitively expensive to collect. In other\nfields, such as computer vision, it is common to utilize shared, reusable\ndatasets, such as ImageNet, to overcome this challenge, but this has proven\ndifficult in robotics. In this paper, we ask: what would it take to enable\npractical data reuse in robotics for end-to-end skill learning? We hypothesize\nthat the key is to use datasets with multiple tasks and multiple domains, such\nthat a new user that wants to train their robot to perform a new task in a new\ndomain can include this dataset in their training process and benefit from\ncross-task and cross-domain generalization. To evaluate this hypothesis, we\ncollect a large multi-domain and multi-task dataset, with 7,200 demonstrations\nconstituting 71 tasks across 10 environments, and empirically study how this\ndata can improve the learning of new tasks in new environments. We find that\njointly training with the proposed dataset and 50 demonstrations of a\nnever-before-seen task in a new domain on average leads to a 2x improvement in\nsuccess rate compared to using target domain data alone. We also find that data\nfor only a few tasks in a new domain can bridge the domain gap and make it\npossible for a robot to perform a variety of prior tasks that were only seen in\nother domains. These results suggest that reusing diverse multi-task and\nmulti-domain datasets, including our open-source dataset, may pave the way for\nbroader robot generalization, eliminating the need to re-collect data for each\nnew robot learning project.",

While naively retraining\nthe model from scratch is an option, it is almost always associated with a\nlarge computational effort for deep learning models. Thus, several approaches\nto approximately unlearn have been proposed along with corresponding metrics\nthat formalize what it means for a model to forget about a data point. In this\nwork, we first taxonomize approaches and metrics of approximate unlearning. As\na result, we identify verification error, i.e., the L2 difference between the\nweights of an approximately unlearned and a naively retrained model, as a\nmetric approximate unlearning should optimize for as it implies a large class\nof other metrics.

Multi-sensor extrinsic calibration is one of the key factors of\nsensor fusion.

When the system dynamics are unknown,\nsafety-critical synthesis becomes more challenging.

In this paper, we study the problem of control\nsynthesis for safety-critical sampled-data systems with unknown dynamics. We\novercome the challenges introduced by sampled-data implementation and unknown\ndynamics by constructing a set of control barrier function (CBF)-based\nconstraints. By satisfying the constructed CBF constraint at each sampling\ntime, we guarantee the unknown sampled-data system is safe for all time. We\nformulate a non-convex program to solve for the control signal at each sampling\ntime. We decompose the non-convex program into two convex sub-problems.

    "abstract": "Dynamic graph embedding has gained great attention recently due to its\ncapability of learning low dimensional graph representations for complex\ntemporal graphs with high accuracy. However, recent advances mostly focus on\nlearning node embeddings as deterministic \"vectors\" for static graphs yet\ndisregarding the key graph temporal dynamics and the evolving uncertainties\nassociated with node embedding in the latent space. In this work, we propose an\nefficient stochastic dynamic graph embedding method (DynG2G) that applies an\ninductive feed-forward encoder trained with node triplet-based contrastive\nloss. Every node per timestamp is encoded as a time-dependent probabilistic\nmultivariate Gaussian distribution in the latent space, hence we can quantify\nthe node embedding uncertainty on-the-fly. We adopted eight different\nbenchmarks that represent diversity in size (from 96 nodes to 87,626 and from\n13,398 edges to 4,870,863) and diversity in dynamics. We demonstrate via\nextensive experiments on these eight dynamic graph benchmarks that DynG2G\nachieves new state-of-the-art performance in capturing the underlying temporal\nnode embeddings. We also demonstrate that DynG2G can predict the evolving node\nembedding uncertainty, which plays a crucial role in quantifying the intrinsic\ndimensionality of the dynamical system over time. We obtain a universal\nrelation of the optimal embedding dimension, $L_o$, versus the effective\ndimensionality of uncertainty, $D_u$, and we infer that $L_o=D_u$ for all\ncases. This implies that the uncertainty quantification approach we employ in\nthe DynG2G correctly captures the intrinsic dimensionality of the dynamics of\nsuch evolving graphs despite the diverse nature and composition of the graphs\nat each timestamp. Moreover, this $L_0 - D_u$ correlation provides a clear path\nto select adaptively the optimum embedding size at each timestamp by setting $L\n\\ge D_u$.",

Recently, the propagation\nof sensors and smart meters has produced an enormous volume of data, which\nsupports the development of data based PVPG forecasting. Although emerging deep\nlearning (DL) models, such as the long short-term memory (LSTM) model, based on\nhistorical data, have provided effective solutions for PVPG forecasting with\ngreat successes, these models utilize offline learning. As a result, DL models\ncannot take advantage of the opportunity to learn from newly-arrived data, and\nare unable to handle concept drift caused by installing extra PV units and\nunforeseen PV unit failures. Consequently, to improve day-ahead PVPG\nforecasting accuracy, as well as eliminate the impacts of concept drift, this\npaper proposes an adaptive LSTM (AD-LSTM) model, which is a DL framework that\ncan not only acquire general knowledge from historical data, but also\ndynamically learn specific knowledge from newly-arrived data. A two-phase\nadaptive learning strategy (TP-ALS) is integrated into AD-LSTM, and a sliding\nwindow (SDWIN) algorithm is proposed, to detect concept drift in PV systems.\nMultiple datasets from PV systems are utilized to assess the feasibility and\neffectiveness of the proposed approaches. The developed AD-LSTM model\ndemonstrates greater forecasting capability than the offline LSTM model,\nparticularly in the presence of concept drift.

    "abstract": "We investigate the activity detection and channel estimation issues for\ncell-free Internet of Things (IoT) networks with massive random access. In each\ntime slot, only partial devices are active and communicate with neighboring\naccess points (APs) using non-orthogonal random pilot sequences. Different from\nthe centralized processing in cellular networks, the activity detection and\nchannel estimation in cell-free IoT is more challenging due to the distributed\nand user-centric architecture. We propose a two-stage approach to detect the\nrandom activities of devices and estimate their channel states. In the first\nstage, the activity of each device is jointly detected by its adjacent APs\nbased on the vector approximate message passing (Vector AMP) algorithm. In the\nsecond stage, each AP re-estimates the channel using the linear minimum mean\nsquare error (LMMSE) method based on the detected activities to improve the\nchannel estimation accuracy. We derive closed-form expressions for the activity\ndetection error probability and the mean-squared channel estimation errors for\na typical device. Finally, we analyze the performance of the entire cell-free\nIoT network in terms of coverage probability. Simulation results validate the\nderived closed-form expressions and show that the cell-free IoT significantly\noutperforms the collocated massive MIMO and small-cell schemes in terms of\ncoverage probability.",

    "abstract": "Event cameras are novel sensors that perceive the per-pixel intensity changes\nand output asynchronous event streams, showing lots of advantages over\ntraditional cameras, such as high dynamic range (HDR) and no motion blur. It\nhas been shown that events alone can be used for object tracking by motion\ncompensation or prediction. However, existing methods assume that the target\nalways moves and is the stand-alone object. Moreover, they fail to track the\nstopped non-independent moving objects on fixed scenes. In this paper, we\npropose a novel event-based object tracking framework, called SiamEvent, using\nSiamese networks via edge-aware similarity learning. Importantly, to find the\npart having the most similar edge structure of target, we propose to correlate\nthe embedded events at two timestamps to compute the target edge similarity.\nThe Siamese network enables tracking arbitrary target edge by finding the part\nwith the highest similarity score. This extends the possibility of event-based\nobject tracking applied not only for the independent stand-alone moving\nobjects, but also for various settings of the camera and scenes. In addition,\ntarget edge initialization and edge detector are also proposed to prevent\nSiamEvent from the drifting problem. Lastly, we built an open dataset including\nvarious synthetic and real scenes to train and evaluate SiamEvent. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that SiamEvent achieves up to 15% tracking performance\nenhancement than the baselines on the real-world scenes and more robust\ntracking performance in the challenging HDR and motion blur conditions.",

Towards this\nend, we introduce a \\textit{multiwavelet-based neural operator learning scheme}\nthat compresses the associated operator's kernel using fine-grained wavelets.\nBy explicitly embedding the inverse multiwavelet filters, we learn the\nprojection of the kernel onto fixed multiwavelet polynomial bases. The\nprojected kernel is trained at multiple scales derived from using repeated\ncomputation of multiwavelet transform. This allows learning the complex\ndependencies at various scales and results in a resolution-independent scheme.\nCompare to the prior works, we exploit the fundamental properties of the\noperator's kernel which enable numerically efficient representation. We perform\nexperiments on the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, Burgers' equation, Darcy\nFlow, and Navier-Stokes equation. Compared with the existing neural operator\napproaches, our model shows significantly higher accuracy and achieves\nstate-of-the-art in a range of datasets. For the time-varying equations, the\nproposed method exhibits a ($2X-10X$) improvement ($0.0018$ ($0.0033$) relative\n$L2$ error for Burgers' (KdV) equation).

We first\nemploy a series of exploratory experiments to verify that neither high-strength\narchitecture parameters regularization nor warmup training scheme can\neffectively solve this problem. Based on the insights from the experiments, we\nconjecture that the performance of DARTS does not depend on the well-trained\nsupernet weights and argue that the architecture parameters should be trained\nby the gradients which are obtained in the early stage rather than the final\nstage of training. This argument is then verified by exchanging the learning\nrate schemes of weights and parameters. Experimental results show that the\nsimple swap of the learning rates can effectively solve the degradation and\nachieve competitive performance. Further empirical evidence suggests that the\ndegradation is not a simple problem of the validation set overfitting but\nexhibit some links between the degradation and the operation selection bias\nwithin bilevel optimization dynamics. We demonstrate the generalization of this\nbias and propose to utilize this bias to achieve an operation-magnitude-based\nselective stop.",

Though, such\nfeatures of social media platforms also present it a root cause of fake news\ndistribution, causing adverse consequences on both people and culture. Hence,\ndetecting fake news has become a significant research interest for bringing\nfeasible real time solutions to the problem. Most current techniques of fake\nnews disclosure are supervised, that need large cost in terms of time and\neffort to make a certainly interpreted dataset. The proposed framework\nconcentrates on the text-based detection of fake news items while considering\nthat only limited number of labels are available. Graphs are functioned\nextensively under several purposes of real-world problems on the strength of\ntheir property to structure things easily. Deep neural networks are used to\ngenerate great results within tasks that utilizes graph classification. The\nGraph Convolution Network works as a deep learning paradigm which works on\ngraphs. Our proposed framework deals with limited amount of labelled data; we\ngo for a semi-supervised learning method. We come up with a semi-supervised\nfake news detection technique based on GCN (Graph Convolutional Networks). The\nrecommended architecture comprises of three basic components: collecting word\nembeddings from the news articles in datasets utilising GloVe, building\nsimilarity graph using Word Movers Distance (WMD) and finally applying Graph\nConvolution Network (GCN) for binary classification of news articles in\nsemi-supervised paradigm. The implemented technique is validated on three\ndifferent datasets by varying the volume of labelled data achieving 95.27 %\nhighest accuracy on Real or Fake dataset.

We propose a new method of rotation augmentation\nthat can be implemented in a few lines of code.

    "abstract": "Serverless applications are usually composed of multiple short-lived,\nsingle-purpose functions exchanging data in reaction to events or changes of\nstates. Existing function orchestration services coordinate functions and\ntrigger their activation following some predefined rules (e.g., function\ndependency and state machine), while being oblivious to the underlying data\nexchange between functions. Such design has limited expressiveness and incurs\nhigh orchestration overhead: developers often need to manage complex function\ninteractions by themselves, and the performance can still be unsatisfactory. In\nthis paper, we advocate data-centric orchestration where function invocations\nare triggered by the flow of data. In our design, the platform provides data\ntrigger APIs through which developers can control when and how the output of\none or many functions is passed to other functions as input and triggers their\nexecutions. With explicit support of data triggers, complex function\ninteractions can be easily implemented, and data locality can also be\nsatisfied. As a manifestation of this design, we present Pheromone, a scalable,\nlow-latency serverless platform. Pheromone schedules functions close to the\ninput with a two-level, shared-nothing scheduling hierarchy. Compared to\nexisting commercial and open-source platforms, Pheromone cuts the latencies of\nfunction interactions and data exchanges by orders of magnitude and scales well\nto complex workflows with long function chains and high parallelism.

It is argued that being cooperative is not only important\nfor their improved functioning, especially, when they use shared resources\n(e.g., parking spaces, public roads, curbside space and walkways), but also as\na favourable requirement analogous to how humans cooperating with other humans\ncan be advantageous and often viewed favourably. The usefulness of such\nmachine-to-machine cooperation are illustrated via examples including\ncooperative crowdsourcing, cooperative traffic routing and parking as well as\nfuturistic scenarios involving urban robots for delivery and shopping. It is\nargued that just as privacy-by-design and security-by-design are important\nconsiderations, in order to yield systems that fulfil ethical requirements,\ncooperative-by-design should also be an imperative for autonomous systems that\nare separately owned but co-inhabit the same spaces and use common resources.\nIf a machine using shared public spaces is not cooperative, as one might\nexpect, then it is not only anti-social but not behaving ethically. It is also\nproposed that certification for urban robots that operate in public could be\nexplored.",

The existing line of\nstudies mostly focuses on visual place recognition to recognize previously\nvisited places solely based on their appearance.

Extending our previous work on a\nrotation invariant spatial descriptor, the proposed descriptor completes a\ngeneric descriptor robust to both rotation (heading) and translation when\nroll-pitch motions are not severe.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new source model and training scheme to improve the\naccuracy and speed of the multichannel variational autoencoder (MVAE) method.\nThe MVAE method is a recently proposed powerful multichannel source separation\nmethod. It consists of pretraining a source model represented by a conditional\nVAE (CVAE) and then estimating separation matrices along with other unknown\nparameters so that the log-likelihood is non-decreasing given an observed\nmixture signal. Although the MVAE method has been shown to provide high source\nseparation performance, one drawback is the computational cost of the\nbackpropagation steps in the separation-matrix estimation algorithm. To\novercome this drawback, a method called \"FastMVAE\" was subsequently proposed,\nwhich uses an auxiliary classifier VAE (ACVAE) to train the source model. By\nusing the classifier and encoder trained in this way, the optimal parameters of\nthe source model can be inferred efficiently, albeit approximately, in each\nstep of the algorithm. However, the generalization capability of the trained\nACVAE source model was not satisfactory, which led to poor performance in\nsituations with unseen data. To improve the generalization capability, this\npaper proposes a new model architecture (called the \"ChimeraACVAE\" model) and a\ntraining scheme based on knowledge distillation. The experimental results\nrevealed that the proposed source model trained with the proposed loss function\nachieved better source separation performance with less computation time than\nFastMVAE. We also confirmed that our methods were able to separate 18 sources\nwith a reasonably good accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Program optimization is the process of modifying software to execute more\nefficiently. Because finding the optimal program is generally undecidable,\nmodern compilers usually resort to expert-written heuristic optimizations. In\ncontrast, superoptimizers attempt to find the optimal program by employing\nsignificantly more expensive search and constraint solving techniques.\nGenerally, these methods do not scale well to programs in real development\nscenarios, and as a result superoptimization has largely been confined to\nsmall-scale, domain-specific, and/or synthetic program benchmarks. In this\npaper, we propose a framework to learn to superoptimize real-world programs by\nusing neural sequence-to-sequence models. We introduce the Big Assembly\nbenchmark, a dataset consisting of over 25K real-world functions mined from\nopen-source projects in x86-64 assembly, which enables experimentation on\nlarge-scale optimization of real-world programs. We propose an approach, Self\nImitation Learning for Optimization (SILO) that is easy to implement and\noutperforms a standard policy gradient learning approach on our Big Assembly\nbenchmark. Our method, SILO, superoptimizes programs an expected 6.2% of our\ntest set when compared with the gcc version 10.3 compiler's aggressive\noptimization level -O3. We also report that SILO's rate of superoptimization on\nour test set is over five times that of a standard policy gradient approach and\na model pre-trained on compiler optimization demonstration.",

We formulate the correspondence as\nfinding paths in a joint space-time graph, where nodes are grid patches sampled\nfrom frames, and are linked by two types of edges: (i) neighbor relations that\ndetermine the aggregation strength from intra-frame neighbors in space, and\n(ii) similarity relations that indicate the transition probability of\ninter-frame paths across time.

    "abstract": "Intelligent data-driven fault diagnosis methods have been widely applied, but\nmost of these methods need a large number of high-quality labeled samples. It\ncosts a lot of labor and time to label data in actual industrial processes,\nwhich challenges the application of intelligent fault diagnosis methods. To\nsolve this problem, a multi-stage semi-supervised improved deep embedded\nclustering (MS-SSIDEC) method is proposed for the bearing fault diagnosis under\nthe insufficient labeled samples situation. This method includes three stages:\npre-training, deep clustering and enhanced supervised learning. In the first\nstage, a skip-connection based convolutional auto-encoder (SCCAE) is proposed\nand pre-trained to automatically learn low-dimensional representations. In the\nsecond stage, a semi-supervised improved deep embedded clustering (SSIDEC)\nmodel that integrates the pre-trained auto-encoder with a clustering layer is\nproposed for deep clustering. Additionally, virtual adversarial training (VAT)\nis introduced as a regularization term to overcome the overfitting in the\nmodel's training. In the third stage, high-quality clustering results obtained\nin the second stage are assigned to unlabeled samples as pseudo labels. The\nlabeled dataset is augmented by those pseudo-labeled samples and used to train\na bearing fault discriminative model. The effectiveness of the method is\nevaluated on the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing dataset. The\nresults show that the method can not only satisfy the semi-supervised learning\nunder a small number of labeled samples, but also solve the problem of\nunsupervised learning, and has achieved better results than traditional\ndiagnosis methods. This method provides a new research idea for fault diagnosis\nwith limited labeled samples by effectively using unsupervised data.",

Thanks to the large\ntraffic volume, short video lifespan and streaming fashion of these services,\nit has become more and more pressing to improve the existing recommender\nsystems to accommodate these challenges in a cost-effective way. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel concept-aware denoising graph neural network (named CONDE)\nfor micro-video recommendation. CONDE consists of a three-phase graph\nconvolution process to derive user and micro-video representations: warm-up\npropagation, graph denoising and preference refinement. A heterogeneous\ntripartite graph is constructed by connecting user nodes with video nodes, and\nvideo nodes with associated concept nodes, extracted from captions and comments\nof the videos. To address the noisy information in the graph, we introduce a\nuser-oriented graph denoising phase to extract a subgraph which can better\nreflect the user's preference. Despite the main focus of micro-video\nrecommendation in this paper, we also show that our method can be generalized\nto other types of tasks. Therefore, we also conduct empirical studies on a\nwell-known public E-commerce dataset.

In this work, we propose a more elegant method to\nreformulate NER tasks as LM problems without any templates.

This results in the demand\nfor automatically understanding the sketches. Thus, the sketch recognition task\nbecomes more significant than before. To accomplish this task, it is necessary\nto solve the critical issue of improving the distinction of the sketch\nfeatures. To this end, we have made efforts in three aspects. First, a novel\nmulti-scale residual block is designed. Compared with the conventional basic\nresidual block, it can better perceive multi-scale information and reduce the\nnumber of parameters during training. Second, a hierarchical residual structure\nis built by stacking multi-scale residual blocks in a specific way. In contrast\nwith the single-level residual structure, the learned features from this\nstructure are more sufficient. Last but not least, the compact triplet-center\nloss is proposed specifically for the sketch recognition task. It can solve the\nproblem that the triplet-center loss does not fully consider too large\nintra-class space and too small inter-class space in sketch field. By studying\nthe above modules, a hierarchical residual network as a whole is proposed for\nsketch recognition and evaluated on Tu-Berlin benchmark thoroughly.

However,\nexisting works leverage the social relationship to aggregate user features from\nfriends' historical behavior sequences in a user-level indirect paradigm. A\nsignificant defect of the indirect paradigm is that it ignores the temporal\nrelationships between behavior events across users. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel time-aware sequential recommendation framework called Social Temporal\nExcitation Networks (STEN), which introduces temporal point processes to model\nthe fine-grained impact of friends' behaviors on the user s dynamic interests\nin an event-level direct paradigm. Moreover, we propose to decompose the\ntemporal effect in sequential recommendation into social mutual temporal effect\nand ego temporal effect. Specifically, we employ a social heterogeneous graph\nembedding layer to refine user representation via structural information. To\nenhance temporal information propagation, STEN directly extracts the\nfine-grained temporal mutual influence of friends' behaviors through the\nmutually exciting temporal network. Besides, the user s dynamic interests are\ncaptured through the self-exciting temporal network.

We demonstrate the adaptability and effectiveness of our\nproposed TIQF pose estimation approach with various information gain criteria.\nWe find similar performance in terms of pose accuracy with sparse measurements\n($<15$ points) across all the selected criteria.

In a previous study, we investigated this question for deep ReLU\nnetworks with a fixed width.

For this\nreason, we first study convergence of general ReLU networks with increasing\nwidths and then apply the results obtained to deep convolutional neural\nnetworks. It turns out the convergence reduces to convergence of infinite\nproducts of matrices with increasing sizes, which has not been considered in\nthe literature.

However, the lack of studies investigating the\nrelationship of intelligence and personality to performance in code\ncomprehension makes scientifically sound reasoning about their influence\ndifficult. We conduct the first empirical evaluation, a correlational study\nwith undergraduates, to investigate the correlation of intelligence and\npersonality with performance in code comprehension, that is with correctness in\nanswering comprehension questions on code snippets. We found that personality\ntraits are unlikely to impact code comprehension performance, at least not\nconsidered in isolation. Conscientiousness, in combination with other factors,\nhowever, explains some of the variance in code comprehension performance. For\nintelligence, significant small to moderate positive effects on code\ncomprehension performance were found for three of four factors measured, i.e.,\nfluid intelligence, visual perception, and cognitive speed. Crystallized\nintelligence has a positive but statistically insignificant effect on code\ncomprehension performance. According to our results, several intelligence\nfacets as well as the personality trait conscientiousness are potential\nconfounders that should not be neglected in code comprehension studies of\nindividual performance and should be controlled for via an appropriate study\ndesign. We call for the conduct of further studies on the relationship between\nintelligence and personality with code comprehension, in part because code\ncomprehension involves more facets than we can measure in a single study and\nbecause our regression model explains only a small portion of the variance in\ncode comprehension performance.",

It is\nimportant to retain past information associated with a current action. However,\nlong short-term memory (LSTM), a popular recurrent unit for modeling temporal\ninformation from videos, accumulates past information from the previous hidden\nand cell states and the extracted visual features at each timestep without\nconsidering the relationships between the past and current information.\nConsequently, the forget gate of the original LSTM can lose the accumulated\ninformation relevant to the current action because it determines which\ninformation to forget without considering the current action.

Precisely, we formalize constrained generation as a tree\nexploration process guided by a discriminator according to how well the\nassociated sequence respects the constraint. Using a discriminator to guide\nthis generation, rather than fine-tuning the LM, in addition to be easier and\ncheaper to train, allows to apply the constraint more finely and dynamically.\nWe propose several original methods to search this generation tree, notably the\nMonte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) which provides theoretical guarantees on the\nsearch efficiency, but also simpler methods based on re-ranking a pool of\ndiverse sequences using the discriminator scores. We evaluate these methods on\ntwo types of constraints and languages: review polarity and emotion control in\nFrench and English.

    "abstract": "Recently, coded distributed computing (CDC), with advantages in intensive\ncomputation and reduced latency, has attracted a lot of research interest for\nedge computing, in particular, IoT applications, including IoT data\npre-processing and data analytics. Nevertheless, it can be challenging for edge\ninfrastructure providers (EIPs) with limited edge resources to support IoT\napplications performed in a CDC approach in edge networks, given the additional\ncomputational resources required by CDC. In this paper, we propose coded edge\nfederation, in which different EIPs collaboratively provide edge resources for\nCDC tasks. To study the Nash equilibrium, when no EIP has an incentive to\nunilaterally alter its decision on edge resource allocation, we model the coded\nedge federation based on evolutionary game theory. Since the replicator\ndynamics of the classical evolutionary game are unable to model economic-aware\nEIPs which memorize past decisions and utilities, we propose fractional\nreplicator dynamics with a power-law fading memory via Caputo fractional\nderivatives. The proposed dynamics allow us to study a broad spectrum of EIP\ndynamic behaviors, such as EIP sensitivity and aggressiveness in strategy\nadaptation, which classical replicator dynamics cannot capture. Theoretical\nanalysis and extensive numerical results justify the existence, uniqueness, and\nstability of the equilibrium in the fractional evolutionary game.

In this paper, we show that when one uses such\noptimized designs, the associated algorithms necessarily have the undesirable\nfeature that the tail of the regret distribution behaves like that of a\ntruncated Cauchy distribution.

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel type of computationally efficient artificial neural\nnetwork (ANN) called the rank similarity filter (RSF). RSFs can be used to both\ntransform and classify nonlinearly separable datasets with many data points and\ndimensions. The weights of RSF are set using the rank orders of features in a\ndata point, or optionally the 'confusion' adjusted ranks between features\n(determined from their distributions in the dataset). The activation strength\nof a filter determines its similarity to other points in the dataset, a measure\nrelated to cosine similarity. The activation of many RSFs maps samples into a\nnew nonlinear space suitable for linear classification (the rank similarity\ntransform (RST)). We additionally used this method to create the nonlinear rank\nsimilarity classifier (RSC), which is a fast and accurate multiclass\nclassifier, and the nonlinear rank similarity probabilistic classifier (RSPC),\nwhich is an extension to the multilabel case. We evaluated the classifiers on\nmultiple datasets and RSC was competitive with existing classifiers but with\nsuperior computational efficiency. Open-source code for RST, RSC and RSPC was\nwritten in Python using the popular scikit-learn framework to make it easily\naccessible. In future extensions the algorithm can be applied to specialised\nhardware suitable for the parallelization of an ANN (GPU) and a Spiking Neural\nNetwork (neuromorphic computing) with corresponding performance gains. This\nmakes RSF a promising solution to the problem of efficient analysis of\nnonlinearly separable data.",

Our\nmotivation is two-fold: first, 3D environments are complex, the use of\nheterogeneous multi-robot systems intuitively can facilitate sensor scanning by\nfully taking advantage of sensors with different capabilities. Second, in\nuncertain environments (e.g. rescue), time is of great significance. Since the\nlearning process normally takes time to train and adapt to a new environment,\nwe need to find an effective way to explore and adapt quickly. To this end, in\nthis paper, we present a meta-learning approach to improve the exploration and\nadaptation capabilities.

Machine translation has been used to make systems multilingual, but\nthis can introduce a pipeline of errors. Another promising solution is using\ncross-lingual transfer learning through pretrained multilingual models.\nExisting methods train multilingual models with additional code-mixed task data\nor refine the cross-lingual representations through parallel ontologies. In\nthis work, we enhance the transfer learning process by intermediate fine-tuning\nof pretrained multilingual models, where the multilingual models are fine-tuned\nwith different but related data and/or tasks. Specifically, we use parallel and\nconversational movie subtitles datasets to design cross-lingual intermediate\ntasks suitable for downstream dialogue tasks. We use only 200K lines of\nparallel data for intermediate fine-tuning which is already available for 1782\nlanguage pairs. We test our approach on the cross-lingual dialogue state\ntracking task for the parallel MultiWoZ (English -> Chinese, Chinese ->\nEnglish) and Multilingual WoZ (English -> German, English -> Italian) datasets.\nWe achieve impressive improvements (> 20% on joint goal accuracy) on the\nparallel MultiWoZ dataset and the Multilingual WoZ dataset over the vanilla\nbaseline with only 10% of the target language task data and zero-shot setup\nrespectively.",

However, existing video\nprocessing algorithms usually contain redundant parameters to guarantee\ndifferent super-resolution scenes. In this work, we focus on super-resolution\nof face areas in original video scenes, while rest areas are interpolated. This\nspecific super-resolved task makes it possible to cut redundant parameters in\ngeneral video super-resolution networks. We construct a dataset consisting\nentirely of face video sequences for network training and evaluation, and\nconduct hyper-parameter optimization in our experiments. We use three combined\nstrategies to optimize the network parameters with a simultaneous\ntrain-evaluation method to accelerate optimization process. Results show that\nsimultaneous train-evaluation method improves the training speed and\nfacilitates the generation of efficient networks.

Several of its aspects of interest have been\ninvestigated in the literature, including variants for modifications of proper\ncolourings. These variants include, notably, the achromatic number of graphs,\nwhich is the maximum number of colours required to colour the vertices of\ngraphs properly so that each possible combination of distinct colours is\nassigned along some edge. The behaviours of this parameter have led to many\ninvestigations of interest, bringing to light both similarities and\ndiscrepancies with the chromatic number. This work takes place in a recent\ntrend aiming at extending the chromatic theory of graphs to the realm of signed\ngraphs, and, in particular, at investigating how classic results adapt to the\nsigned context. Most of the works done in that line to date are with respect to\ntwo main generalisations of proper colourings of signed graphs, attributed to\nZaslavsky and Guenin. Generalising the achromatic number to signed graphs was\ninitiated recently by Lajou, his investigations being related to Guenin's\ncolourings. We here pursue this line of research, but with taking Zaslavsky's\ncolourings as our notion of proper colourings.

For evaluating these metrics, we derive a closed-form\nposition-based metric, the secrecy improvement, and propose an analogous\ncomputationally simpler metric.

    "abstract": "Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) are trusted machines that perform sensitive\noperations in critical ecosystems. They are usually required by law in\nfinancial and government digital services. The most important feature of an HSM\nis its ability to store sensitive credentials and cryptographic keys inside a\ntamper-resistant hardware, so that every operation is done internally through a\nsuitable API, and such sensitive data are never exposed outside the device.\nHSMs are now conveniently provided in the cloud, meaning that the physical\nmachines are remotely hosted by some provider and customers can access them\nthrough a standard API. The property of keeping sensitive data inside the\ndevice is even more important in this setting as a vulnerable application might\nexpose the full API to an attacker. Unfortunately, in the last 20+ years a\nmultitude of practical API-level attacks have been found and proved feasible in\nreal devices. The latest version of PKCS#11, the most popular standard API for\nHSMs, does not address these issues leaving all the flaws possible. In this\npaper, we propose the first secure HSM configuration that does not require any\nrestriction or modification of the PKCS#11 API and is suitable to cloud HSM\nsolutions, where compliance to the standard API is of paramount importance. The\nconfiguration relies on a careful separation of roles among the different HSM\nusers so that known API flaws are not exploitable by any attacker taking\ncontrol of the application. We prove the correctness of the configuration by\nproviding a formal model in the state-of-the-art Tamarin prover and we show how\nto implement the configuration in a real cloud HSM solution.",

By dynamically tuning the reflection\namplitudes/phase shifts of a large number of passive elements, IRS enables\nflexible wireless channel control and configuration, and thereby enhances the\nwireless signal transmission rate and reliability significantly. Despite the\nvast literature on designing and optimizing assorted IRS-aided wireless\nsystems, prior works have mainly focused on enhancing wireless links with\nsingle signal reflection only by one or multiple IRSs, which may be\ninsufficient to boost the wireless link capacity under some harsh propagation\nconditions (e.g., indoor environment with dense blockages/obstructions). This\nissue can be tackled by employing two or more IRSs to assist each wireless link\nand jointly exploiting their single as well as multiple signal reflections over\nthem. However, the resultant double-/multi-IRS aided wireless systems face more\ncomplex design issues as well as new practical challenges for implementation as\ncompared to the conventional single-IRS counterpart, in terms of IRS reflection\noptimization, channel acquisition, as well as IRS deployment and\nassociation/selection. As such, a new paradigm for designing multi-IRS\ncooperative passive beamforming and joint active/passive beam routing arises\nwhich calls for innovative design approaches and optimization methods. In this\npaper, we give a tutorial overview of multi-IRS aided wireless networks, with\nan emphasis on addressing the new challenges due to multi-IRS signal reflection\nand routing.

This system is\nused at multiple schools and universities in Iceland and Kenya, mostly for\nmathematics and statistics. Students earn SmileyCoin, a cryptocurrency, while\nstudying. In Iceland the system has typically been used by students who use\ntheir own devices to solve homework assignments during the semester, accessing\nthe Internet-based tutor-web at this http URL These students typically\ntake final exams on paper at the end of the semester. In Kenya the system is a\npart of a plan to enhance mathematics education using educational technology,\norganised by the Smiley Charity with the African Maths Initiative. This has\nbeen done by donating servers running the tutor-web to schools and tablets to\nstudents. Typically these schools do not have Internet access so the\ncryptocurrency can not be used. Innovative redesign was needed during COVID-19\nin spring, 2020, since universities in Iceland were not able to host in-house\nfinals and schools in Kenya were closed so tablets could not be donated\ndirectly to students. Remote finals were held in Iceland but the implementation\nwas largely in the hands of the instructors. In Kenya, community libraries\nremained open and became a place for students to come in to study. Innovations\nincluded using the tutor-web as a remote drilling system in place of final\nexams in a large undergraduate course in statistics and donating tablets to\nlibraries in Kenya. These libraries all have access to the Internet and the\nstudents have therefore been given the option to purchase the tablet using\ntheir SmileyCoin. This paper describes these implementations and how this\nunintended experiment will likely affect the future development and use of the\ntutor-web in both countries.",

Among the context information that advertising\nstakeholders leverage, location information is certainly one of them.

The accuracy of this approach has often been questioned in\nthe past: however, the reality check on an advertising DSP shows that this\ntechnique accounts for a large fraction of the served advertisements. In this\npaper, we revisit the work in the field, that is mostly from almost one decade\nago, through the lenses of big data. More specifically, we, i) benchmark two\ncommercial Internet geolocation databases, evaluate the quality of their\ninformation using a ground truth database of user positions containing more\nthan 2 billion samples, ii) analyze the internals of these databases, devising\na theoretical upper bound for the quality of the Internet geolocation approach,\nand iii) we run an empirical study that unveils the monetary impact of this\ntechnology by considering the costs associated with a real-world ad impressions\ndataset.

In such applications,\nrobust people avoidance must be provided by fusing a number of sensing\nmodalities in order to avoid collisions. Currently however, people detection\nsystems used on drones are solely based on standard cameras besides an emerging\nnumber of works discussing the fusion of imaging and event-based cameras. On\nthe other hand, radar-based systems provide up-most robustness towards\nenvironmental conditions but do not provide complete information on their own\nand have mainly been investigated in automotive contexts, not for drones. In\norder to enable the fusion of radars with both event-based and standard\ncameras, we present KUL-UAVSAFE, a first-of-its-kind dataset for the study of\nsafety-critical people detection by drones. In addition, we propose a baseline\nCNN architecture with cross-fusion highways and introduce a curriculum learning\nstrategy for multi-modal data termed SAUL, which greatly enhances the\nrobustness of the system towards hard RGB failures and provides a significant\ngain of 15% in peak F1 score compared to the use of BlackIn, previously\nproposed for cross-fusion networks.

However, non-autoregressive neural vocoders such\nas WaveGlow are far behind autoregressive neural vocoders like WaveFlow in\nterms of modeling audio signals due to their limitation in expressiveness. In\naddition, though NanoFlow is a state-of-the-art autoregressive neural vocoder\nthat has immensely small parameters, its performance is marginally lower than\nWaveFlow. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new type of autoregressive\nneural vocoder called FlowVocoder, which has a small memory footprint and is\nable to generate high-fidelity audio in real-time. Our proposed model improves\nthe expressiveness of flow blocks by operating a mixture of Cumulative\nDistribution Function(CDF) for bipartite transformation. Hence, the proposed\nmodel is capable of modeling waveform signals as well as WaveFlow, while its\nmemory footprint is much smaller thanWaveFlow. As shown in experiments,\nFlowVocoder achieves competitive results with baseline methods in terms of both\nsubjective and objective evaluation, also, it is more suitable for real-time\ntext-to-speech applications.",

In this paper, we formulate a variant of this\nproblem, which we call the strict unbounded knapsack problem with bounded\nweights, by replacing the inequality constraint on the total weight with an\nequality. We show that this problem can be decomposed into a two-stage,\npre-emptive goal programming problem, with the first stage being a\n2-dimensional knapsack problem and the second being either a linear feasibility\nprogram (per canonical formulation) or simply a linearly-constrained program in\nthe general case. This reformulation is shown to be equivalent to the original\nformulation but allows the use of well-studied, efficient algorithms for\nmultidimensional knapsack problems. In addition, it separates the modeling\neffort around what to put in the knapsack from considerations around what unit\nweight one should assign to each item type, providing substantially more\nflexibility to the modeler without adding complexity to the choice of knapsack\nconfiguration. Finally, we show that for the feasibility version of the second\nstage, one can immediately get a feasible solution to the first stage solution.",

    "abstract": "The correlation properties of sequences form a focal point in the design of\nmultiple access systems of communications. Such a system must be able to serve\na number of simultaneous users while keeping interference low. A popular choice\nfor the set of sequences to deploy is the quasi-complementary sequence set\n(QCSS). Its large set size enables the system to accommodate a lot of users.\nThe set has low nontrivial correlation magnitudes within a zone around the\norigin. This keeps undue interference among users under control. A QCSS\nperforms better than the perfect complementary sequence set (PCSS) does in\nschemes with fractional delays.\nThe optimality of a set of periodic sequences is measured by its maximum\nperiodic correlation magnitude, for which there is an established lower bound\nto aim at. For a fixed period, optimal sets are known only for very restricted\nparameters. Efforts have therefore been centered around the constructions of\nasymptotically optimal sets. Their periods are allowed to be as large as\nsufficient to establish optimality. In this paper we share an insight that a\nsequence set that asymptotically attains the Welch bound generates an\nasymptotically optimal periodic QCSS by interleaving. One can simply use known\nfamilies of such sequence sets to construct the desired QCSSs. Seven families\nof QCSSs with specific parameters are shown as examples of this general\nconstruction. We build upon the insight to propose two new direct constructions\nof asymptotically optimal QCSSs with very flexible parameters without\ninterleaving.

Exploiting the\nability of the algorithm to scale to high-dimensional data, we propose an\nonline anomaly detection method to identify anomalies in a collection of\nmultivariate time series. We demonstrate the applicability of the online\nalgorithm in identifying counties in the United States with anomalous trends in\nterms of COVID-19 related cases and deaths. Several of the identified anomalous\ncounties correlate with counties with documented poor response to the COVID\npandemic.",

We also show that CIDEr-D has performance hampered by the lack of\nmultiple reference sentences and high variance of sentence length. To bypass\nthis problem, we introduce CIDEr-R, which improves CIDEr-D, making it more\nflexible in dealing with datasets with high sentence length variance. We\ndemonstrate that CIDEr-R is more accurate and closer to human judgment than\nCIDEr-D; CIDEr-R is more robust regarding the number of available references.\nOur results reveal that using Self-Critical Sequence Training to optimize\nCIDEr-R generates descriptive captions. In contrast, when CIDEr-D is optimized,\nthe generated captions' length tends to be similar to the reference length.\nHowever, the models also repeat several times the same word to increase the\nsentence length.",

However, often these wearables collect various sensitive personal\ninformation of a user with no to limited authentication, e.g., knowledge-based\nexternal authentication techniques, such as PINs. While most of these external\nauthentication techniques suffer from multiple limitations, including recall\nburden, human errors, or biases, researchers have started using various\nphysiological and behavioral data, such as gait and heart rate, collected by\nthe wearables to authenticate a wearable user implicitly with a limited\naccuracy due to sensing and computing constraints of wearables. In this work,\nwe explore the usefulness of blood oxygen saturation SpO2 values collected from\nthe Oximeter device to distinguish a user from others. From a cohort of 25\nsubjects, we find that 92% of the cases SpO2 can distinguish pairs of users.\nFrom detailed modeling and performance analysis, we observe that while SpO2\nalone can obtain an average accuracy of 0.69 and F1 score of 0.69, the addition\nof heart rate (HR) can improve the average identification accuracy by 15% and\nF1 score by 13%.

    "abstract": "While many studies have looked at privacy properties of the Android and\nGoogle Play app ecosystem, comparatively much less is known about iOS and the\nApple App Store, the most widely used ecosystem in the US. At the same time,\nthere is increasing competition around privacy between these smartphone\noperating system providers. In this paper, we present a study of 24k Android\nand iOS apps from 2020 along several dimensions relating to user privacy. We\nfind that third-party tracking and the sharing of unique user identifiers was\nwidespread in apps from both ecosystems, even in apps aimed at children. In the\nchildren's category, iOS apps used much fewer advertising-related tracking than\ntheir Android counterparts, but could more often access children's location (by\na factor of 7). Across all studied apps, our study highlights widespread\npotential violations of US, EU and UK privacy law, including 1) the use of\nthird-party tracking without user consent, 2) the lack of parental consent\nbefore sharing PII with third-parties in children's apps, 3) the\nnon-data-minimising configuration of tracking libraries, 4) the sending of\npersonal data to countries without an adequate level of data protection, and 5)\nthe continued absence of transparency around tracking, partly due to design\ndecisions by Apple and Google.

    "abstract": "Speech restoration aims to remove distortions in speech signals. Prior\nmethods mainly focus on single-task speech restoration(SSR), such as speech\nenhancement or speech declipping. However, SSR systems only focus on one task\nand do not address the general speech restoration problem. Previous SSR systems\nalso have limited performance in speech restoration tasks such as speech\nsuper-resolution. To overcome those limitations, we propose a general speech\nrestoration(GSR) task that attempts to remove multiple distortions\nsimultaneously. Furthermore, we propose VoiceFixer, a generative framework to\naddress the GSR tasks. VoiceFixer consists of an analysis stage and a synthesis\nstage to mimic the speech analysis and comprehension of the human auditory\nsystem. We employ a ResUNet to model the analysis module and a neural vocoder\nto model the synthesis module. We evaluate VoiceFixer with additive noise, room\nreverberation, low-resolution, and clipping distortions. Our baseline GSR model\nachieves a 0.499 higher mean opinion score(MOS) than the speech enhancement SSR\nmodel. VoiceFixer further surpasses the GSR baseline model on the MOS score by\n0.256. In addition, we observe that VoiceFixer generalizes well to severely\ndegraded real speech recordings, indicating its potential in restoring old\nmovies and historical speeches.

Also unlike\nprior approaches, rather than determining a constant lag from studying a group\nof patients, we treat the lag as a random variable, whose parameters we\ndetermine empirically by fitting our infections sequence to the sequence of\ndeaths. Our approach allows us to narrow our estimation to smaller time\nintervals in order to observe how the IFR changes over time. We analyze a 250\nday period starting on March 1, 2020.

Specifically, we\nfirst exploit an auto-encoder to represent input data samples with latent\nfeatures for the construction of an attribute matrix. We also construct a mixed\nsigned and symmetric structure matrix to capture the local geometric structure\nunderlying data samples. Then, we perform self-expressiveness on the\nconstructed attribute and structure matrices to learn their affinity graphs\nseparately. Finally, we design a novel attention-based fusion module to\nadaptively leverage these two affinity graphs to construct a more\ndiscriminative affinity graph. Extensive experimental results on commonly used\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that our AASSC-Net significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods. In addition, we conduct comprehensive ablation\nstudies to discuss the effectiveness of the designed modules. The code will be\npublicly available at https://github.com/ZhihaoPENG-CityU.",

    "abstract": "Death has long been overlooked in evolutionary algorithms. Recent research\nhas shown that death (when applied properly) can benefit the overall fitness of\na population and can outperform sub-sections of a population that are\n\"immortal\" when allowed to evolve together in an environment [1]. In this\npaper, we strive to experimentally determine whether death is an adapted trait\nand whether this adaptation can be used to enhance our implementations of\nconventional genetic algorithms. Using some of the most widely accepted\nevolutionary death and aging theories, we observed that senescent death (in\nvarious forms) can lower the total run-time of genetic algorithms, increase the\noptimality of a solution, and decrease the variance in an algorithm's\nperformance. We believe that death-enhanced genetic algorithms can accomplish\nthis through their unique ability to backtrack out of and/or avoid getting\ntrapped in local optima altogether.",

According to recent studies, on average 25% of\ndevelopment effort is spent, i.e. wasted, on TD caused issues in software\ndevelopment organizations. However, further research is needed to investigate\nthe relations between various software development activities and TD. The\nobjective of this study is twofold. First, to get empirical insight on the\nunderstanding and the use of the TD concept in the IT industry. Second, to\ncontribute towards precise conceptualization of the TD concept through analysis\nof causes and effects. In order to address the research objective a family of\nsurveys was designed as a part of an international initiative that congregates\nresearchers from 12 countries -- InsighTD. At country level, national teams ran\nsurvey replications with industry practitioners from the respective countries.\nIn total 653 valid responses were collected from 6 countries. Regarding the\nprevalence of the TD concept 22% of practitioners have only theoretical\nknowledge about it, and 47% have some practical experiences with TD\nidentification or management. Further analysis indicated that senior\npractitioners who work in larger organizations, larger teams, and on larger\nsystems are more likely to be experienced with TD management. Time pressure or\ndeadline was the single most cited cause of TD. Regarding the effects of TD:\ndelivery delay, low maintainability, and rework were the most cited.

Because the source location represents the\nvaluable information of the target being monitored and tracked, it is of great\npractical significance to achieve a high degree of privacy of the source\nlocation. Although many studies based on phantom nodes have alleviates the\nprotection of source location privacy to some extent. It is urgent to solve the\nproblems such as complicate the ac path between nodes, improve the centralized\ndistribution of Phantom nodes near the source nodes and reduce the network\ncommunication overhead. In this paper, PSSPR routing is proposed as a visable\napproach to address SLP issues. We use the coordinates of the center node V to\ndivide sector-domain, which act as important role in generating a new phantom\nnodes. The phantom nodes perform specified routing policies to ensure that they\ncan choose various locations. In addition, the directed random route can ensure\nthat data packets avoid the visible range when they move to the sink node hop\nby hop. Thus, the source location is protected. Theoretical analysis and\nsimulation experiments show that this protocol achieves higher security of\nsource node location with less communication overhead.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the problem of online learning, which has gained significant\nattention in recent years due to its applicability in a wide range of fields\nfrom machine learning to game theory. Specifically, we study the online\noptimization of mixable loss functions with logarithmic static regret in a\ndynamic environment. The best dynamic estimation sequence that we compete\nagainst is selected in hindsight with full observation of the loss functions\nand is allowed to select different optimal estimations in different time\nintervals (segments). We propose an online mixture framework that uses these\nstatic solvers as the base algorithm. We show that with the suitable selection\nof hyper-expert creations and weighting strategies, we can achieve logarithmic\nand squared logarithmic regret per switch in quadratic and linearithmic\ncomputational complexity, respectively. For the first time in literature, we\nshow that it is also possible to achieve near-logarithmic regret per switch\nwith sub-polynomial complexity per time. Our results are guaranteed to hold in\na strong deterministic sense in an individual sequence manner.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we revisit the prior mask guidance proposed in \"Prior Guided\nFeature Enrichment Network for Few-Shot Segmentation\". The prior mask serves as\nan indicator that highlights the region of interests of unseen categories, and\nit is effective in achieving better performance on different frameworks of\nrecent studies.\nHowever, the current method directly takes the maximum element-to-element\ncorrespondence between the query and support features to indicate the\nprobability of belonging to the target class, thus the broader contextual\ninformation is seldom exploited during the prior mask generation. To address\nthis issue, first, we propose the Context-aware Prior Mask (CAPM) that\nleverages additional nearby semantic cues for better locating the objects in\nquery images. Second, since the maximum correlation value is vulnerable to\nnoisy features, we take one step further by incorporating a lightweight Noise\nSuppression Module (NSM) to screen out the unnecessary responses, yielding\nhigh-quality masks for providing the prior knowledge.\nBoth two contributions are experimentally shown to have substantial practical\nmerit, and the new model named PFENet++ significantly outperforms the baseline\nPFENet as well as all other competitors on three challenging benchmarks\nPASCAL-5$^i$, COCO-20$^i$ and FSS-1000.\nThe new state-of-the-art performance is achieved without compromising the\nefficiency, manifesting the potential for being a new strong baseline in\nfew-shot semantic segmentation.\nOur code will be available at https://github.com/dvlab-research/PFENet++.",

To make human-machine interaction more natural, cognitive features like\nVisual Voice Activity Detection (VVAD), which can detect whether a person is\nspeaking or not, given visual input of a camera, need to be implemented. Neural\nnetworks are state of the art for tasks in Image Processing, Time Series\nPrediction, Natural Language Processing and other domains. Those Networks\nrequire large quantities of labeled data. Currently there are not many datasets\nfor the task of VVAD. In this work we created a large scale dataset called the\nVVAD-LRS3 dataset, derived by automatic annotations from the LRS3 dataset. The\nVVAD-LRS3 dataset contains over 44K samples, over three times the next\ncompetitive dataset (WildVVAD). We evaluate different baselines on four kinds\nof features: facial and lip images, and facial and lip landmark features. With\na Convolutional Neural Network Long Short Term Memory (CNN LSTM) on facial\nimages an accuracy of 92% was reached on the test set.

    "abstract": "The successful training of neural networks typically involves careful and\ntime consuming hyperparameter tuning. Population Based Training (PBT) has\nrecently been proposed to automate this process. PBT trains a population of\nneural networks concurrently, frequently mutating their hyperparameters\nthroughout their training. However, the decision mechanisms of PBT are greedy\nand favour short-term improvements which can, in some cases, lead to poor\nlong-term performance. This paper presents Faster Improvement Rate PBT (FIRE\nPBT) which addresses this problem. Our method is guided by an assumption: given\ntwo neural networks with similar performance and training with similar\nhyperparameters, the network showing the faster rate of improvement will lead\nto a better final performance. Using this, we derive a novel fitness metric and\nuse it to make some of the population members focus on long-term performance.\nOur experiments show that FIRE PBT is able to outperform PBT on the ImageNet\nbenchmark and match the performance of networks that were trained with a\nhand-tuned learning rate schedule. We apply FIRE PBT to reinforcement learning\ntasks and show that it leads to faster learning and higher final performance\nthan both PBT and random hyperparameter search.",

    "abstract": "Vagueness and ambiguity in privacy policies threaten the ability of consumers\nto make informed choices about how businesses collect, use, and share their\npersonal information. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) of 2018 was\nintended to provide Californian consumers with more control by mandating that\nbusinesses (1) clearly disclose their data practices and (2) provide choices\nfor consumers to opt out of specific data practices. In this work, we explore\nto what extent CCPA's disclosure requirements, as implemented in actual privacy\npolicies, can help consumers to answer questions about the data practices of\nbusinesses. First, we analyzed 95 privacy policies from popular websites; our\nfindings showed that there is considerable variance in how businesses interpret\nCCPA's definitions. Then, our user survey of 364 Californian consumers showed\nthat this variance affects the ability of users to understand the data\npractices of businesses. Our results suggest that CCPA's mandates for privacy\ndisclosures, as currently implemented, have not yet yielded the level of\nclarity they were designed to deliver, due to both vagueness and ambiguity in\nCCPA itself as well as potential non-compliance by businesses in their privacy\npolicies.",

    "abstract": "Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) may demonstrate racial bias when\nskin or choroidal pigmentation is present in medical images. Recent studies\nhave shown that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can predict race from\nimages that were not previously thought to contain race-specific features. We\nevaluate whether grayscale retinal vessel maps (RVMs) of patients screened for\nretinopathy of prematurity (ROP) contain race-specific features.\nMethods: 4095 retinal fundus images (RFIs) were collected from 245 Black and\nWhite infants. A U-Net generated RVMs from RFIs, which were subsequently\nthresholded, binarized, or skeletonized. To determine whether RVM differences\nbetween Black and White eyes were physiological, CNNs were trained to predict\nrace from color RFIs, raw RVMs, and thresholded, binarized, or skeletonized\nRVMs. Area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR) was evaluated.\nFindings: CNNs predicted race from RFIs near perfectly (image-level AUC-PR:\n0.999, subject-level AUC-PR: 1.000). Raw RVMs were almost as informative as\ncolor RFIs (image-level AUC-PR: 0.938, subject-level AUC-PR: 0.995).\nUltimately, CNNs were able to detect whether RFIs or RVMs were from Black or\nWhite babies, regardless of whether images contained color, vessel segmentation\nbrightness differences were nullified, or vessel segmentation widths were\nnormalized.\nInterpretation: AI can detect race from grayscale RVMs that were not thought\nto contain racial information. Two potential explanations for these findings\nare that: retinal vessels physiologically differ between Black and White babies\nor the U-Net segments the retinal vasculature differently for various fundus\npigmentations. Either way, the implications remain the same: AI algorithms have\npotential to demonstrate racial bias in practice, even when preliminary\nattempts to remove such information from the underlying images appear to be\nsuccessful.",

    "abstract": "Traditionally, caregivers, whether formal or informal, have taken the\nresponsibility of providing assistance and care to patients with cognitive\ndecline. Usually, both the caregiver and the patient are subjected to financial\nand emotional burdens, which impact the patient's life quality. To overcome\nthis issue, Ambient Assistive Living (AAL) technologies have been adopted to\nreplace the caregivers and complement patients' lack of intelligence.\nTechnologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nhave enabled intelligent ubiquitous learning for smart buildings to monitor the\ncognitively declined occupants and provide in-home assistive services and\nsolutions. This paper aims to summarize and evaluate the intelligence\ncomplements provided by smart buildings that can increase the cognitively\ndeclined occupants' quality of life and autonomy. Through a systematic\nliterature review, the authors find that most of the existing contributions are\ntowards identifying the occupants' behavior, and thus, to determine\ncorresponding assistive services and solutions. Five key research gaps are\nidentified, including the lack of adequate adoption of technological\ninterventions to fully support the occupants' autonomy and independence. The\nauthors also propose a conceptual framework to highlight the research gaps in\nsmart building applications for cognitively declined occupants and to map the\nfuture research directions.",

How do images\nspanning such a broad range of appearances reliably convey meaning? Do viewers\nunderstand drawings based solely on their ability to resemble the entities they\nrefer to (i.e., as images), or do they understand drawings based on shared but\narbitrary associations with these entities (i.e., as symbols)? In this paper,\nwe provide evidence for a cognitive account of pictorial meaning in which both\nvisual and social information is integrated to support effective visual\ncommunication. To evaluate this account, we used a communication task where\npairs of participants used drawings to repeatedly communicate the identity of a\ntarget object among multiple distractor objects. We manipulated social cues\nacross three experiments and a full internal replication, finding pairs of\nparticipants develop referent-specific and interaction-specific strategies for\ncommunicating more efficiently over time, going beyond what could be explained\nby either task practice or a pure resemblance-based account alone. Using a\ncombination of model-based image analyses and crowdsourced sketch annotations,\nwe further determined that drawings did not drift toward arbitrariness, as\npredicted by a pure convention-based account, but systematically preserved\nthose visual features that were most distinctive of the target object.

    "abstract": "Both animals and artificial agents benefit from state representations that\nsupport rapid transfer of learning across tasks and which enable them to\nefficiently traverse their environments to reach rewarding states. The\nsuccessor representation (SR), which measures the expected cumulative,\ndiscounted state occupancy under a fixed policy, enables efficient transfer to\ndifferent reward structures in an otherwise constant Markovian environment and\nhas been hypothesized to underlie aspects of biological behavior and neural\nactivity. However, in the real world, rewards may move or only be available for\nconsumption once, may shift location, or agents may simply aim to reach goal\nstates as rapidly as possible without the constraint of artificially imposed\ntask horizons. In such cases, the most behaviorally-relevant representation\nwould carry information about when the agent was likely to first reach states\nof interest, rather than how often it should expect to visit them over a\npotentially infinite time span. To reflect such demands, we introduce the\nfirst-occupancy representation (FR), which measures the expected temporal\ndiscount to the first time a state is accessed. We demonstrate that the FR\nfacilitates the selection of efficient paths to desired states, allows the\nagent, under certain conditions, to plan provably optimal trajectories defined\nby a sequence of subgoals, and induces similar behavior to animals avoiding\nthreatening stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Estimating the 3D hand pose from a 2D image is a well-studied problem and a\nrequirement for several real-life applications such as virtual reality,\naugmented reality, and hand-gesture recognition. Currently, good estimations\ncan be computed starting from single RGB images, especially when forcing the\nsystem to also consider, through a multi-task learning approach, the hand shape\nwhen the pose is determined. However, when addressing the aforementioned\nreal-life tasks, performances can drop considerably depending on the hand\nrepresentation, thus suggesting that stable descriptions are required to\nachieve satisfactory results. As a consequence, in this paper we present a\nkeypoint-based end-to-end framework for the 3D hand and pose estimation, and\nsuccessfully apply it to the hand-gesture recognition task as a study case.\nSpecifically, after a pre-processing step where the images are normalized, the\nproposed pipeline comprises a multi-task semantic feature extractor generating\n2D heatmaps and hand silhouettes from RGB images; a viewpoint encoder\npredicting hand and camera view parameters; a stable hand estimator producing\nthe 3D hand pose and shape; and a loss function designed to jointly guide all\nof the components during the learning phase. To assess the proposed framework,\ntests were performed on a 3D pose and shape estimation benchmark dataset,\nobtaining state-of-the-art performances. What is more, the devised system was\nalso evaluated on 2 hand-gesture recognition benchmark datasets, where the\nframework significantly outperforms other keypoint-based approaches; indicating\nthat the presented method is an effective solution able to generate stable 3D\nestimates for the hand pose and shape.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we present a flexible method for explaining, in human readable\nterms, the predictions made by decision trees used as decision support in liver\ntransplantation. The decision trees have been obtained through machine learning\napplied on a dataset collected at the liver transplantation unit at the\nCoru\\~na University Hospital Center and are used to predict long term (five\nyears) survival after transplantation. The method we propose is based on the\nrepresentation of the decision tree as a set of rules in a logic program (LP)\nthat is further annotated with text messages. This logic program is then\nprocessed using the tool xclingo (based on Answer Set Programming) that allows\nbuilding compound explanations depending on the annotation text and the rules\neffectively fired when a given input is provided. We explore two alternative LP\nencodings: one in which rules respect the tree structure (more convenient to\nreflect the learning process) and one where each rule corresponds to a\n(previously simplified) tree path (more readable for decision making).",

    "abstract": "Symbolic regression is a powerful system identification technique in\nindustrial scenarios where no prior knowledge on model structure is available.\nSuch scenarios often require specific model properties such as\ninterpretability, robustness, trustworthiness and plausibility, that are not\neasily achievable using standard approaches like genetic programming for\nsymbolic regression. In this chapter we introduce a deterministic symbolic\nregression algorithm specifically designed to address these issues. The\nalgorithm uses a context-free grammar to produce models that are parameterized\nby a non-linear least squares local optimization procedure. A finite\nenumeration of all possible models is guaranteed by structural restrictions as\nwell as a caching mechanism for detecting semantically equivalent solutions.\nEnumeration order is established via heuristics designed to improve search\nefficiency. Empirical tests on a comprehensive benchmark suite show that our\napproach is competitive with genetic programming in many noiseless problems\nwhile maintaining desirable properties such as simple, reliable models and\nreproducibility.",

    "abstract": "This work proposes a robotic pipeline for picking and constrained placement\nof objects without geometric shape priors. Compared to recent efforts developed\nfor similar tasks, where every object was assumed to be novel, the proposed\nsystem recognizes previously manipulated objects and performs online model\nreconstruction and reuse. Over a lifelong manipulation process, the system\nkeeps learning features of objects it has interacted with and updates their\nreconstructed models. Whenever an instance of a previously manipulated object\nreappears, the system aims to first recognize it and then register its\npreviously reconstructed model given the current observation. This step greatly\nreduces object shape uncertainty allowing the system to even reason for parts\nof the objects that are currently not observable. This also results in better\nmanipulation efficiency as it reduces the need for active perception of the\ntarget object during manipulation. To get a reusable reconstructed model, the\nproposed pipeline adopts i) TSDF for object representation, and ii) a variant\nof the standard particle filter algorithm for pose estimation and tracking of\nthe partial object model. Furthermore, an effective way to construct and\nmaintain a dataset of manipulated objects is presented. A sequence of\nreal-world manipulation experiments is performed to show how future\nmanipulation tasks become more effective and efficient by reusing reconstructed\nmodels of previously manipulated objects that were generated on the fly instead\nof treating objects as novel every time.",

    "abstract": "Establishing robust and accurate correspondences between a pair of images is\na long-standing computer vision problem with numerous applications. While\nclassically dominated by sparse methods, emerging dense approaches offer a\ncompelling alternative paradigm that avoids the keypoint detection step.\nHowever, dense flow estimation is often inaccurate in the case of large\ndisplacements, occlusions, or homogeneous regions. In order to apply dense\nmethods to real-world applications, such as pose estimation, image\nmanipulation, or 3D reconstruction, it is therefore crucial to estimate the\nconfidence of the predicted matches.\nWe propose the Enhanced Probabilistic Dense Correspondence Network, PDC-Net+,\ncapable of estimating accurate dense correspondences along with a reliable\nconfidence map. We develop a flexible probabilistic approach that jointly\nlearns the flow prediction and its uncertainty. In particular, we parametrize\nthe predictive distribution as a constrained mixture model, ensuring better\nmodelling of both accurate flow predictions and outliers. Moreover, we develop\nan architecture and an enhanced training strategy tailored for robust and\ngeneralizable uncertainty prediction in the context of self-supervised\ntraining. Our approach obtains state-of-the-art results on multiple challenging\ngeometric matching and optical flow datasets.

    "abstract": "While modern deep neural networks are performant perception modules,\nperformance (accuracy) alone is insufficient, particularly for safety-critical\nrobotic applications such as self-driving vehicles. Robot autonomy stacks also\nrequire these otherwise blackbox models to produce reliable and calibrated\nmeasures of confidence on their predictions. Existing approaches estimate\nuncertainty from these neural network perception stacks by modifying network\narchitectures, inference procedure, or loss functions. However, in general,\nthese methods lack calibration, meaning that the predictive uncertainties do\nnot faithfully represent the true underlying uncertainties (process noise). Our\nkey insight is that calibration is only achieved by imposing constraints across\nmultiple examples, such as those in a mini-batch; as opposed to existing\napproaches which only impose constraints per-sample, often leading to\noverconfident (thus miscalibrated) uncertainty estimates. By enforcing the\ndistribution of outputs of a neural network to resemble a target distribution\nby minimizing an $f$-divergence, we obtain significantly better-calibrated\nmodels compared to prior approaches.

    "abstract": "In the preface to his Cyclopaedia published in 1728 Ephraim Chambers offers\nreaders a systematized structure of his attempt to produce a universal\nrepository of human knowledge. Divided into an interconnected taxonomic tree\nand domain vocabulary, this structure forms the basis of one effort from the\nMetadata Research Center to study historical ontologies. The knowledge\nstructure is being encoded into a Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS)\nform as well as a Web Ontology Language (OWL) version. This paper explores the\nexpressive and functional differences between these SKOS and OWL versions of\nChambers' knowledge structure. As part of this goal, the paper research focused\non the construction and application of rules in each system to produce a more\ncomputationally ready representation of Chambers' structure in SKOS, which is\nmore thesaurus-like, and OWL, which represents additional ontological nuances.\nFirst, studying the various textual aspects at the semantic, syntactic, and\ntypographic levels allowed for the relationships between terms to manifest from\nwhich rules governing expression of the connections between elements developed.\nSecond, because each language, SKOS and OWL, functionally expresses different\nlogical relationships, their possibilities and limitations offer a ground for\nfurther analyzing the resultant knowledge structures; although, each stemmed\nfrom the same basic source of Chambers' text. Lastly this paper will examine\nrule making and expression in light of Paul Grice's theory of conversational\nimplicature to understand how a naive agent formulates and applies these rules\nto a knowledge structure.",

Domain shift is a serious problem for generalization of\nmachine learning models and it is well-established that a domain shift between\nthe training and test sets may cause a drastic drop in the model's performance.\nIn medical imaging, there can be many sources of domain shift such as different\nscanners or scan protocols, different pathologies in the patient population,\nanatomical differences in the patient population (e.g. men vs women) etc.\nTherefore, in order to train models that have good generalization performance,\nit is important to be aware of the domain shift problem, its potential causes\nand to devise ways to address it. In this paper, we study the effect of domain\nshift on left and right ventricle blood pool segmentation in short axis cardiac\nMR images. Our dataset contains short axis images from 4 different MR scanners\nand 3 different pathology groups. The training is performed with nnUNet. The\nresults show that scanner differences cause a greater drop in performance\ncompared to changing the pathology group, and that the impact of domain shift\nis greater on right ventricle segmentation compared to left ventricle\nsegmentation. Increasing the number of training subjects increased\ncross-scanner performance more than in-scanner performance at small training\nset sizes, but this difference in improvement decreased with larger training\nset sizes.

    "abstract": "The rampant adoption of ML methodologies has revealed that models are usually\nadopted to make decisions without taking into account the uncertainties in\ntheir predictions. More critically, they can be vulnerable to adversarial\nexamples. Thus, we believe that developing ML systems that take into account\npredictive uncertainties and are robust against adversarial examples is a must\nfor critical, real-world tasks. We start with a case study in retailing. We\npropose a robust implementation of the Nerlove-Arrow model using a Bayesian\nstructural time series model. Its Bayesian nature facilitates incorporating\nprior information reflecting the manager's views, which can be updated with\nrelevant data. However, this case adopted classical Bayesian techniques, such\nas the Gibbs sampler. Nowadays, the ML landscape is pervaded with neural\nnetworks and this chapter also surveys current developments in this sub-field.\nThen, we tackle the problem of scaling Bayesian inference to complex models and\nlarge data regimes. In the first part, we propose a unifying view of two\ndifferent Bayesian inference algorithms, Stochastic Gradient Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo (SG-MCMC) and Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD), leading to\nimproved and efficient novel sampling schemes. In the second part, we develop a\nframework to boost the efficiency of Bayesian inference in probabilistic models\nby embedding a Markov chain sampler within a variational posterior\napproximation. After that, we present an alternative perspective on adversarial\nclassification based on adversarial risk analysis, and leveraging the scalable\nBayesian approaches from chapter 2. In chapter 4 we turn to reinforcement\nlearning, introducing Threatened Markov Decision Processes, showing the\nbenefits of accounting for adversaries in RL while the agent learns.",

    "abstract": "The polarization of optical fields is a crucial degree of freedom in the\nall-optical analogue of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT).\nHowever, the physical origins of EIT and polarization induced phenomena have\nnot been well distinguished, which can lead to confusion in associated\napplications such as slow light and optical/quantum storage. Here we study the\npolarization effects in various optical EIT systems. We find that a\npolarization mismatch between whispering gallery modes in two indirectly\ncoupled resonators can induce a narrow transparency window in the transmission\nspectrum resembling the EIT lineshape. However, such polarization induced\ntransparency (PIT) is distinct from EIT: it originates from strong polarization\nrotation effects and shows unidirectional feature. The coexistence of PIT and\nEIT provides new routes for the manipulation of light flow in optical resonator\nsystems.",

    "abstract": "Quantum Approximate Optimization algorithm (QAOA) is one of the candidates to\nachieve a near-term quantum advantage. As QAOA seems only capable of solving\noptimization problems, there is a folklore that QAOA cannot see the difference\nbetween easy problems such as 2-SAT and hard problems such as 3-SAT -- although\n2-SAT is in the polynomial-time (P) class, its optimization version is also\nnondeterministic polynomial-time (NP)-hard. In this paper, we show that the\nfolklore is not true. We find a computational phase transition in QAOA when\nsolving a variant of 3-SAT -- the amplitude of gradient and the success\nprobability achieve their minimum at the well-known SAT-UNSAT phase transition.\nOn the contrary, for 2-SAT, such a phenomena is absent at SAT-UNSAT phase\ntransition and the success probability is unity for a reasonable circuit depth.\nIn solving the NP-hard optimization versions of SAT, we identify quantum\nadvantages over a classical approximate algorithm at quite a shallow depth of\np=4 for the problem size of $n=10$.",

    "abstract": "Resource allocation problems are often approached with linear program-ming\ntechniques. But many concrete allocation problems in the experimental and\nob-servational sciences cannot or should not be expressed in the form of linear\nobjectivefunctions. Even if the objective is linear, its parameters may not be\nknown beforehandbecause they depend on the results of the experiment for which\nthe allocation is to bedetermined. To address these challenges, we present a\nbipartite Graph Neural Networkarchitecture for trainable resource allocation\nstrategies. Items of value and constraintsform the two sets of graph nodes,\nwhich are connected by edges corresponding to pos-sible allocations. The GNN is\ntrained on simulations or past problem occurrences tomaximize any\nuser-supplied, scientifically motivated objective function, augmented byan\ninfeasibility penalty. The amount of feasibility violation can be tuned in\nrelation toany available slack in the system. We apply this method to optimize\nthe astronomicaltarget selection strategy for the highly multiplexed Subaru\nPrime Focus Spectrographinstrument, where it shows superior results to direct\ngradient descent optimization andextends the capabilities of the currently\nemployed solver which uses linear objectivefunctions.

However, the\npeculiarities of applied research conditions can make this analytically\nintractable. We present a general and automated approach to causal inference in\ndiscrete settings. We show causal questions with discrete data reduce to\npolynomial programming problems, and we present an algorithm to automatically\nbound causal effects using efficient dual relaxation and spatial\nbranch-and-bound techniques. The user declares an estimand, states assumptions,\nand provides data (however incomplete or mismeasured). The algorithm then\nsearches over admissible data-generating processes and outputs the most precise\npossible range consistent with available information -- i.e., sharp bounds --\nincluding a point-identified solution if one exists. Because this search can be\ncomputationally intensive, our procedure reports and continually refines\nnon-sharp ranges that are guaranteed to contain the truth at all times, even\nwhen the algorithm is not run to completion. Moreover, it offers an additional\nguarantee we refer to as $\\epsilon$-sharpness, characterizing the worst-case\nlooseness of the incomplete bounds.

In this work, we present a novel\ndeep-learning-based approach for metal artifact reduction (MAR). In order to\nalleviate the need for anatomically identical CT image pairs (i.e., metal\nartifact-corrupted CT image and metal artifact-free CT image) for network\nlearning, we propose a self-supervised cross-domain learning framework.\nSpecifically, we train a neural network to restore the metal trace region\nvalues in the given metal-free sinogram, where the metal trace is identified by\nthe forward projection of metal masks. We then design a novel FBP\nreconstruction loss to encourage the network to generate more perfect\ncompletion results and a residual-learning-based image refinement module to\nreduce the secondary artifacts in the reconstructed CT images. To preserve the\nfine structure details and fidelity of the final MAR image, instead of directly\nadopting CNN-refined images as output, we incorporate the metal trace\nreplacement into our framework and replace the metal-affected projections of\nthe original sinogram with the prior sinogram generated by the forward\nprojection of the CNN output. We then use the filtered backward projection\n(FBP) algorithms for final MAR image reconstruction.

    "abstract": "The traditional (active) reliability redundancy allocation problem (RRAP) is\nused to maximize system reliability by determining the redundancy and\nreliability variables in each subsystem to satisfy the volume, cost, and weight\nconstraints. The RRAP structure is very simple, that is, redundant components\nare parallel in each subsystem, and all subsystems are either connected in\nseries or in a bridge network. Owing to its important and practical\napplications, a novel RRAP, called the general RRAP (GRRAP), is proposed to\nextend the series-parallel structure or bridge network to a more general\nnetwork structure. To solve the proposed novel GRRAP, a new algorithm, called\nthe BAT-SSOA3, used the simplified swarm optimization (SSO) to update\nsolutions, the small-sampling tri-objective orthogonal array (SS3OA) to tune\nthe parameters in the proposed algorithm, the binary-addition-tree algorithm\n(BAT) to calculate the fitness (i.e., reliability) of each solution, and the\npenalty function to force infeasible back to the feasible region. To validate\nthe proposed algorithm, the BAT-SSOA3 is compared with state-of-the-art\nalgorithms, such as, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and SSO, via designed\nexperiments and computational studies.",

However, before an eventual system design and deployment\ncan proceed, detailed channel sounding measurements are required to understand\nkey channel characteristics. In this paper, we present a first extensive set of\nchannel measurements for urban outdoor environments that are ultra-wideband (1\nGHz 3dB bandwidth), and double-directional where both the transmitter and\nreceiver are at the same height. In all, we present measurements at 38 Tx/Rx\nlocation pairs, consisting of a total of nearly 50,000 impulse responses, at\nboth line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) cases in the 1-100 m\nrange. We provide modeling for path loss, shadowing, delay spread, angular\nspread and multipath component (MPC) power distribution. We find, among other\nthings, that outdoor communication over tens of meters is feasible in this\nfrequency range even in NLoS scenarios, that omni-directional delay spreads of\nup to 100 ns, and directional delay spreads of up to 10 ns are observed, while\nangular spreads are also quite significant, and a surprisingly large number of\nMPCs are observed for 1 GHz bandwidth and 13 degree beamwidth.

Motor severity (captured via motor score) is a key component\nin assessing overall HD severity. However, motor score evaluation involves\nin-clinic visits with a trained medical professional, which are expensive and\nnot always accessible. Speech analysis provides an attractive avenue for\ntracking HD severity because speech is easy to collect remotely and provides\ninsight into motor changes. HD speech is typically characterized as having\nirregular articulation. With this in mind, acoustic features that can capture\nvocal tract movement and articulatory coordination are particularly promising\nfor characterizing motor symptom progression in HD. In this paper, we present\nan experiment that uses Vocal Tract Coordination (VTC) features extracted from\nread speech to estimate a motor score. When using an elastic-net regression\nmodel, we find that VTC features significantly outperform other acoustic\nfeatures across varied-length audio segments, which highlights the\neffectiveness of these features for both short- and long-form reading tasks.\nLastly, we analyze the F-value scores of VTC features to visualize which\nchannels are most related to motor score.

    "abstract": "In this study, we propose index modulation (IM) with circularly-shifted\nchirps (CSCs) (CSC-IM) for dual-function radar and communication (DFRC)\nsystems. The proposed scheme encodes the information bits with the CSC indices\nand the phase-shift keying (PSK) symbols. It allows the receiver to exploit the\nfrequency selectivity naturally in fading channels by combining IM and wideband\nCSCs. It also leverages the fact that a CSC is a constant-envelope signal to\nachieve a controllable peak-to-mean envelope power ratio (PMEPR). For radar\nfunctionality, CSC-IM maintains the good autocorrelation (AC) properties of a\nchirp by ensuring that the transmitted CSCs are separated apart sufficiently in\nthe time domain through index separation (IS). We investigate the impact of IS\non spectral efficiency (SE) and obtain the corresponding mapping functions. For\ntheoretical results, we derive the union bound (UB) of the block error rate\n(BLER) for arbitrary chirps and the Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for the\nrange and reflection coefficients for the matched filter (MF)-based estimation.\nWe also prove that complementary sequences (CSs) can be constructed through\nCSCs by linearly combining the Fourier series of CSCs. Finally, through\ncomprehensive comparisons, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme\nfor DFRC scenarios.",
