    "title": "Graph Based Answer Set Programming Solver Systems",
    "abstract": "Answer set programming (ASP) is a popular nonmonotonic-logic based paradigm\nfor knowledge representation and solving combinatorial problems. Computing the\nanswer set of an ASP program is NP-hard in general, and researchers have been\ninvesting significant effort to speed it up. The majority of current ASP\nsolvers employ SAT solver-like technology to find these answer sets. As a\nresult, justification for why a literal is in the answer set is hard to\nproduce. There are dependency graph based approaches to find answer sets, but\ndue to the representational limitations of dependency graphs, such approaches\nare limited. This paper proposes a novel dependency graph-based approach for\nfinding answer sets in which conjunction of goals is explicitly represented as\na node which allows arbitrary answer set programs to be uniformly represented.\nOur representation preserves causal relationships allowing for justification\nfor each literal in the answer set to be elegantly found. In this paper, we\nexplore two different approaches based on the graph representation: bottom-up\nand top-down. The bottom-up approach finds models by assigning truth values\nalong with the topological order, while the top-down approach generates models\nstarting from the constraints.",

    "abstract": "Lossius et. al introduced the distance-based amplitude panning algorithm, or\nDBAP, to enable flexibility of loudspeaker placement in artistic and scientific\ncontexts. The algorithm allows for arbitrary loudspeaker locations in a 2D\nplane so that a virtual sound source may navigate the 2D space. The gains for\neach speaker are calculated as a function of the source's distance to each\nloudspeaker, thus creating a sound field. This gives the listener the\nimpression of a source moving through the field of loudspeakers. This paper\nintroduces a heuristically developed robust variation of DBAP that corrects for\nfaulty assumptions in the implementation of Lossius. Specifically, this paper\ndevelops a method for working with sound sources outside the field of\nloudspeakers in which the Lossius version produces distorted aural impressions\nand wildly undulating amplitudes caused by spatial discontinuities in the gains\nof the various loudspeakers. In smoothing the spatial impression of the virtual\nsource, we are also able to eliminate the calculation of the convex hull\nentirely, a necessary component of the original implementation. This\nsignificantly simplifies and reduces the calculations required for any space in\neither two or three dimensions.",

Despite the long time since exposure bias\nwas mentioned and the numerous studies for its remedy, to our knowledge, its\nimpact on text generation has not yet been verified. Text degeneration is a\nproblem that the widely-used pre-trained language model GPT-2 was recently\nfound to suffer from (Holtzman et al., 2020). Motivated by the unknown\ncausation of the text degeneration, in this paper we attempt to relate these\ntwo mysteries. Specifically, we first qualitatively quantitatively identify\nmistakes made before text degeneration occurs. Then we investigate the\nsignificance of the mistakes by inspecting the hidden states in GPT-2. Our\nresults show that text degeneration is likely to be partly caused by exposure\nbias. We also study the self-reinforcing mechanism of text degeneration,\nexplaining why the mistakes amplify. In sum, our study provides a more concrete\nfoundation for further investigation on exposure bias and text degeneration\nproblems.",

The primary contribution is a novel\nformulation of the pursuit-evasion problem that modifies the pursuers'\nobjective by requiring that the evader still be detected, even in spite of the\nfailure of any single pursuer robot. This novel constraint, whereby two\npursuers are required to detect an evader, has the benefit of providing\nredundancy to the search, should any member of the team become unresponsive,\nsuffer temporary sensor disruption/failure, or otherwise become incapacitated.\nExisting methods, even those that are designed to respond to failures, rely on\nthe pursuers to replan and update their search pattern to handle such\noccurrences. In contrast, the proposed formulation produces plans that are\ninherently tolerant of some level of disturbance. Building upon this new\nformulation, we introduce an augmented data structure for encoding the problem\nstate and a novel sampling technique to ensure that the generated plans are\nrobust to failures of any single pursuer robot.

Firstly, we propose State-Noisy\nMarkov Decision Process~(SN-MDP) in the tabular case to incorporate both random\nand adversarial state observation noises, in which the contraction of both\nexpectation-based and distributional Bellman operators is derived. Beyond\nSN-MDP with the function approximation, we theoretically characterize the\nbounded gradient norm of histogram-based distributional loss, accounting for\nthe better training robustness of distribution RL. We also provide stricter\nconvergence conditions of the Temporal-Difference~(TD) learning under more\nflexible state noises, as well as the sensitivity analysis by the leverage of\ninfluence function.

The\nnecessary cryptographic key management is made particularly challenging by DNS'\nloosely-federated delegation substrate and unprecedented cryptographic scale.\nThough fundamental for current and future operational success, our community\nlacks a clear notion of how to empirically evaluate the process of securely\nchanging (or transitioning) keys.\nIn this paper, we propose two building blocks to fundamentally understand and\nassess key transitions. First, the anatomy of key transitions: measurable and\nwell-defined properties of key changes; and second a novel classification model\nbased on this anatomy to describe key transitions practices in abstract terms.\nOur anatomy enables the evaluation of cryptographic keys' life cycles in\ngeneral, and comparison of operational practices with prescribed key management\nprocesses, e.g., RFC key rollover guidelines. The fine-grained transition\nanatomy is then abstracted through our classification model to characterize\ntransitions in abstract terms which rather describe a transition's behavior\nthan its specific features.\nThe applicability and utility of our proposed transition anatomy and\ntransition classes are exemplified for the global DNSSEC deployment.\nSpecifically, we use measurements from the first 15 years of the DNSSEC rollout\nto detect and measure which key rollover/transitions have been used, to what\ndegree, and what their rates of errors and warnings have been. Our results show\nmeasurable gaps between prescribed key management processes and key transitions\nin the wild. We also find evidence that such noncompliant transitions are\ninevitable in the wild.",

Aiming at improving passengers' travel time, the present study\nintroduces an advanced data-driven optimization approach to determine the\noptimal stop-skip pattern in urban rail transit lines. In detail, first, using\nthe time-series smart card data for an entire month, we employ a Long\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model to predict the station-level\ndemand rates for the peak hour. This prediction is based on four preceding\nhours and is especially important knowing that the true demand rates of the\npeak hour are posterior information that can be obtained only after the peak\nhour operation is finished. Moreover, utilizing a real-time prediction instead\nof assuming fixed demand rates, allows us to account for unexpected real-time\nchanges which can be detrimental to the subsequent analyses. Then, we integrate\nthe output of the LSTM model as an input to an optimization model with the\nobjective of minimizing patrons' total travel time. Considering the exponential\nnature of the problem, we propose an Ant Colony Optimization technique to solve\nthe problem in a desirable amount of time. Finally, the performance of the\nproposed models and the solution algorithm is assessed using real case data.\nThe results suggest that the proposed approach can enhance the performance of\nthe service by improving both passengers' in-vehicle time as well as\npassengers' waiting time.",

Prior works learn these mappings from human demonstrations: a\nnon-disabled human either teleoperates or kinesthetically guides the robot arm\nthrough a variety of motions, and the robot learns to reproduce the\ndemonstrated behaviors. But this framework is often impractical -- disabled\nusers will not always have access to external demonstrations! Here we instead\nlearn diverse teleoperation mappings without either human demonstrations or\npre-defined tasks. Under our unsupervised approach the robot first optimizes\nfor object state entropy: i.e., the robot autonomously learns to push, pull,\nopen, close, or otherwise change the state of nearby objects. We then embed\nthese diverse, object-oriented behaviors into a latent space for real-time\ncontrol: now pressing the joystick causes the robot to perform dexterous\nmotions like pushing or opening. We experimentally show that -- with a\nbest-case human operator -- our unsupervised approach actually outperforms the\nteleoperation mappings learned from human demonstrations, particularly if those\ndemonstrations are noisy or imperfect. But user study results are less\nclear-cut: although our approach enables participants to complete tasks with\nmultiple objects more quickly, the unsupervised mapping also learns motions\nthat the human does not need, and these additional behaviors may confuse the\nhuman.",

    "abstract": "The impacts of channel estimation errors, inter-cell interference, phase\nadjustment cost, and computation cost on an intelligent reflecting surface\n(IRS)-assisted system are severe in practice but have been ignored for\nsimplicity in most existing works. In this paper, we investigate a\nmulti-antenna base station (BS) serving a single-antenna user with the help of\na multi-element IRS in the presence of channel estimation errors and inter-cell\ninterference. We consider imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the BS,\ni.e., imperfect CSIT, and focus on the robust optimization of the BS's\ninstantaneous CSI-adaptive beamforming and the IRS's quasi-static phase shifts.\nFirst, we formulate the robust optimization of the BS's instantaneous channel\nstate information (CSI)-adaptive beamforming and IRS's quasi-static phase\nshifts for the ergodic rate maximization as a very challenging two-timescale\nstochastic non-convex problem. Then, we obtain a closed-form beamformer for any\ngiven phase shifts and a more tractable single-timescale stochastic non-convex\nproblem only for phase shifts. Next, we propose a low-complexity stochastic\nalgorithm to obtain quasi-static phase shifts which correspond to a KKT point\nof the single-timescale stochastic problem. It is worth noting that the\nproposed method offers a closed-form robust instantaneous CSI-adaptive\nbeamforming design that can promptly adapt to rapid CSI changes over slots and\na robust quasi-static phase shift design of low computation and phase\nadjustment costs in the presence of channel estimation errors and inter-cell\ninterference. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the notable gains of the\nproposed robust joint design over existing ones and reveal the practical values\nof the proposed solutions.",

The homogenous and heterogeneous structured relationships are crucial\nto learning effective identity representation and cross-modality matching. In\nthis paper, we separately model the homogenous structural relationship by a\nmodality-specific graph within individual modality and then mine the\nheterogeneous structural correlation in these two modality-specific graphs.\nFirst, the homogeneous structured graph (HOSG) mines one-vs.-rest relation\nbetween an arbitrary node (local feature) and all the rest nodes within a\nvisible or infrared image to learn effective identity representation.

    "abstract": "A fundamental issue for federated learning (FL) is how to achieve optimal\nmodel performance under highly dynamic communication environments. This issue\ncan be alleviated by the fact that modern edge devices usually can connect to\nthe edge FL server via multiple communication channels (e.g., 4G, LTE and 5G).\nHowever, having an edge device send copies of local models to the FL server\nalong multiple channels is redundant, time-consuming, and would waste resources\n(e.g., bandwidth, battery life and monetary cost). In this paper, motivated by\nthe layered coding techniques in video streaming, we propose a novel FL\nframework called layered gradient compression (LGC). Specifically, in LGC,\nlocal gradients from a device is coded into several layers and each layer is\nsent to the FL server along a different channel. The FL server aggregates the\nreceived layers of local gradients from devices to update the global model, and\nsends the result back to the devices. We prove the convergence of LGC, and\nformally define the problem of resource-efficient federated learning with LGC.\nWe then propose a learning based algorithm for each device to dynamically\nadjust its local computation (i.e., the number of local stochastic descent) and\ncommunication decisions (i.e.,the compression level of different layers and the\nlayer to channel mapping) in each iteration. Results from extensive experiments\nshow that using our algorithm, LGC significantly reduces the training time,\nimproves the resource utilization, while achieving a similar accuracy, compared\nwith well-known FL mechanisms.",

Leveraging the recent advances in the speaker recognition, such as\nhigh-order statistics pooling, multi-branch mechanism, D-TDNN and angular\nadditive margin softmax (AAM) loss with a minimum hyper-spherical energy (MHE),\nSpeechNAS automatically discovers five network architectures, from SpeechNAS-1\nto SpeechNAS-5, of various numbers of parameters and GFLOPs on the large-scale\ntext-independent speaker recognition dataset VoxCeleb1. Our derived best neural\nnetwork achieves an equal error rate (EER) of 1.02% on the standard test set of\nVoxCeleb1, which surpasses previous TDNN based state-of-the-art approaches by a\nlarge margin.

    "title": "Memory Regulation and Alignment toward Generalizer RGB-Infrared Person",
    "abstract": "The domain shift, coming from unneglectable modality gap and non-overlapped\nidentity classes between training and test sets, is a major issue of\nRGB-Infrared person re-identification. A key to tackle the inherent issue --\ndomain shift -- is to enforce the data distributions of the two domains to be\nsimilar. However, RGB-IR ReID always demands discriminative features, leading\nto over-rely feature sensitivity of seen classes, \\textit{e.g.}, via\nattention-based feature alignment or metric learning. Therefore, predicting the\nunseen query category from predefined training classes may not be accurate and\nleads to a sub-optimal adversarial gradient. In this paper, we uncover it in a\nmore explainable way and propose a novel multi-granularity memory regulation\nand alignment module (MG-MRA) to solve this issue. By explicitly incorporating\na latent variable attribute, from fine-grained to coarse semantic granularity,\ninto intermediate features, our method could alleviate the over-confidence of\nthe model about discriminative features of seen classes. Moreover, instead of\nmatching discriminative features by traversing nearest neighbor, sparse\nattributes, \\textit{i.e.}, global structural pattern, are recollected with\nrespect to features and assigned to measure pair-wise image similarity in\nhashing. Extensive experiments on RegDB \\cite{RegDB} and SYSU-MM01 \\cite{SYSU}\nshow the superiority of the proposed method that outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art methods.

    "title": "Towards High-Quality Temporal Action Detection with Sparse Proposals",
    "abstract": "Temporal Action Detection (TAD) is an essential and challenging topic in\nvideo understanding, aiming to localize the temporal segments containing human\naction instances and predict the action categories. The previous works greatly\nrely upon dense candidates either by designing varying anchors or enumerating\nall the combinations of boundaries on video sequences; therefore, they are\nrelated to complicated pipelines and sensitive hand-crafted designs. Recently,\nwith the resurgence of Transformer, query-based methods have tended to become\nthe rising solutions for their simplicity and flexibility. However, there still\nexists a performance gap between query-based methods and well-established\nmethods. In this paper, we identify the main challenge lies in the large\nvariants of action duration and the ambiguous boundaries for short action\ninstances; nevertheless, quadratic-computational global attention prevents\nquery-based methods to build multi-scale feature maps. Towards high-quality\ntemporal action detection, we introduce Sparse Proposals to interact with the\nhierarchical features. In our method, named SP-TAD, each proposal attends to a\nlocal segment feature in the temporal feature pyramid. The local interaction\nenables utilization of high-resolution features to preserve action instances\ndetails. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method,\nespecially under high tIoU thresholds.

To fill in this gap, we propose a\nnovel Accelerated variance-Reduced Conditional gradient Sliding (ARCS)\nalgorithm for finite-sum problems, which can use either first-order or\nzeroth-order information to optimize. To the best of our knowledge, ARCS is the\nfirst zeroth-order conditional gradient sliding type algorithms solving convex\nproblems in zeroth-order optimization.

In\ndoing so, we employed a series of agent-based simulations based on the\nFramework for Intergroup Relations and Multiple Affiliations Networks (FIRMAN).\nAs demonstrated, Facebook has primarily enhanced users' capacity to maintain a\nlarger number of friendships (tie capacity), while has done little to empower\nusers' ability to accept diversity and befriend different others (tie\noutreachability). Facebook must focus on the latter should they truly wish to\ncontribute to the development of a more inclusive society.

    "abstract": "Deep hashing has become a popular method in large-scale image retrieval due\nto its computational and storage efficiency. However, recent works raise the\nsecurity concerns of deep hashing. Although existing works focus on the\nvulnerability of deep hashing in terms of adversarial perturbations, we\nidentify a more pressing threat, backdoor attack, when the attacker has access\nto the training data. A backdoored deep hashing model behaves normally on\noriginal query images, while returning the images with the target label when\nthe trigger presents, which makes the attack hard to be detected. In this\npaper, we uncover this security concern by utilizing clean-label data\npoisoning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at the\nbackdoor attack against deep hashing models. To craft the poisoned images, we\nfirst generate the targeted adversarial patch as the backdoor trigger.\nFurthermore, we propose the confusing perturbations to disturb the hashing code\nlearning, such that the hashing model can learn more about the trigger. The\nconfusing perturbations are imperceptible and generated by dispersing the\nimages with the target label in the Hamming space. We have conducted extensive\nexperiments to verify the efficacy of our backdoor attack under various\nsettings. For instance, it can achieve 63% targeted mean average precision on\nImageNet under 48 bits code length with only 40 poisoned images.",

The\ndifference between DuRecDial 2.0 and existing conversational recommendation\ndatasets is that the data item (Profile, Goal, Knowledge, Context, Response) in\nDuRecDial 2.0 is annotated in two languages, both English and Chinese, while\nother datasets are built with the setting of a single language. We collect 8.2k\ndialogs aligned across English and Chinese languages (16.5k dialogs and 255k\nutterances in total) that are annotated by crowdsourced workers with strict\nquality control procedure. We then build monolingual, multilingual, and\ncross-lingual conversational recommendation baselines on DuRecDial 2.0.\nExperiment results show that the use of additional English data can bring\nperformance improvement for Chinese conversational recommendation, indicating\nthe benefits of DuRecDial 2.0. Finally, this dataset provides a challenging\ntestbed for future studies of monolingual, multilingual, and cross-lingual\nconversational recommendation.",

    "abstract": "Signal capture stands in the forefront to perceive and understand the\nenvironment and thus imaging plays the pivotal role in mobile vision. Recent\nexplosive progresses in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have shown great potential\nto develop advanced mobile platforms with new imaging devices. Traditional\nimaging systems based on the \"capturing images first and processing afterwards\"\nmechanism cannot meet this unprecedented demand. Differently, Computational\nImaging (CI) systems are designed to capture high-dimensional data in an\nencoded manner to provide more information for mobile vision systems.Thanks to\nAI, CI can now be used in real systems by integrating deep learning algorithms\ninto the mobile vision platform to achieve the closed loop of intelligent\nacquisition, processing and decision making, thus leading to the next\nrevolution of mobile vision.Starting from the history of mobile vision using\ndigital cameras, this work first introduces the advances of CI in diverse\napplications and then conducts a comprehensive review of current research\ntopics combining CI and AI. Motivated by the fact that most existing studies\nonly loosely connect CI and AI (usually using AI to improve the performance of\nCI and only limited works have deeply connected them), in this work, we propose\na framework to deeply integrate CI and AI by using the example of self-driving\nvehicles with high-speed communication, edge computing and traffic planning.\nFinally, we outlook the future of CI plus AI by investigating new materials,\nbrain science and new computing techniques to shed light on new directions of\nmobile vision systems.",

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of human movements is required to enhance the efficiency\nof physical human-robot interaction. Behavioral differences across various\nusers are crucial factors that limit the prediction of human motion. Although\nrecent neural network-based modeling methods have improved their prediction\naccuracy, most did not consider an effective adaptations to different users,\nthereby employing the same model parameters for all users. To deal with this\ninsufficiently addressed challenge, we introduce a meta-learning framework to\nfacilitate the rapid adaptation of the model to unseen users. In this study, we\npropose a model structure and a meta-learning algorithm specialized to enable\nfast user adaptation in predicting human movements in cooperative situations\nwith robots. The proposed prediction model comprises shared and adaptive\nparameters, each addressing the user's general and individual movements. Using\nonly a small amount of data from an individual user, the adaptive parameters\nare adjusted to enable user-specific prediction through a two-step process:\ninitialization via a separate network and adaptation via a few gradient steps.\nRegarding the motion dataset that has 20 users collaborating with a robotic\ndevice, the proposed method outperforms existing meta-learning and\nnon-meta-learning baselines in predicting the movements of unseen users.",

    "abstract": "Intent detection (ID) and Slot filling (SF) are two major tasks in spoken\nlanguage understanding (SLU). Recently, attention mechanism has been shown to\nbe effective in jointly optimizing these two tasks in an interactive manner.\nHowever, latest attention-based works concentrated only on the first-order\nattention design, while ignoring the exploration of higher-order attention\nmechanisms. In this paper, we propose a BiLinear attention block, which\nleverages bilinear pooling to simultaneously exploit both the contextual and\nchannel-wise bilinear attention distributions to capture the second-order\ninteractions between the input intent or slot features. Higher and even\ninfinity order interactions are built by stacking numerous blocks and assigning\nExponential Linear Unit (ELU) to blocks. Before the decoding stage, we\nintroduce the Dynamic Feature Fusion Layer to implicitly fuse intent and slot\ninformation in a more effective way. Technically, instead of simply\nconcatenating intent and slot features, we first compute two correlation\nmatrices to weight on two features. Furthermore, we present Higher-order\nAttention Network for the SLU tasks. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show\nthat our approach yields improvements compared with the state-of-the-art\napproach.

Here we test that second\norder prediction with a parallel collection of treebanks controlling for\nannotation style with Universal Dependencies and Surface-Syntactic Universal\nDependencies. To test it, we use a recently introduced score that has many\nmathematical and statistical advantages with respect to the widely used sum of\ndependency distances.

In contrast, one of\nthe most widely used scores, i.e. the sum of dependency distances, fails to\nconfirm that prediction, showing the weakness of raw dependency distances for\nresearch on word order.

In this\npaper, we propose a density-based curriculum learning method for efficient\nexploration with sparse rewards and better generalization to desired goal\ndistribution. Intuitively, our method encourages the robot to gradually broaden\nthe frontier of its ability along the directions to cover the entire desired\ngoal space as much and quickly as possible. To further improve data efficiency\nand generality, we augment the goals and transitions within the allowed region\nduring training.

More notably, GNNs are vulnerable to\nprivacy attacks, such as membership inference attacks, even if only blackbox\naccess to the trained model is granted. To build defenses, differential privacy\nhas emerged as a mechanism to disguise the sensitive data in training datasets.\nFollowing the strategy of Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE),\nrecent methods leverage a large ensemble of teacher models.

    "abstract": "Learning information-rich and generalizable representations effectively from\nunlabeled multivariate cardiac signals to identify abnormal heart rhythms\n(cardiac arrhythmias) is valuable in real-world clinical settings but often\nchallenging due to its complex temporal dynamics. Cardiac arrhythmias can vary\nsignificantly in temporal patterns even for the same patient ($i.e.$, intra\nsubject difference). Meanwhile, the same type of cardiac arrhythmia can show\ndifferent temporal patterns among different patients due to different cardiac\nstructures ($i.e.$, inter subject difference). In this paper, we address the\nchallenges by proposing an Intra-inter Subject self-supervised Learning (ISL)\nmodel that is customized for multivariate cardiac signals. Our proposed ISL\nmodel integrates medical knowledge into self-supervision to effectively learn\nfrom intra-inter subject differences. In intra subject self-supervision, ISL\nmodel first extracts heartbeat-level features from each subject using a\nchannel-wise attentional CNN-RNN encoder. Then a stationarity test module is\nemployed to capture the temporal dependencies between heartbeats. In inter\nsubject self-supervision, we design a set of data augmentations according to\nthe clinical characteristics of cardiac signals and perform contrastive\nlearning among subjects to learn distinctive representations for various types\nof patients.

MS-SincResNet appends 1D\nmulti-scale SincNet (MS-SincNet) to 2D ResNet as the first convolutional layer\nin an attempt to jointly learn 1D kernels and 2D kernels during the training\nstage. First, an input music signal is divided into a number of fixed-duration\n(3 seconds in this study) music clips, and the raw waveform of each music clip\nis fed into 1D MS-SincNet filter learning module to obtain three-channel 2D\nrepresentations. The learned representations carry rich timbral, harmonic, and\npercussive characteristics comparing with spectrograms, harmonic spectrograms,\npercussive spectrograms and Mel-spectrograms. ResNet is then used to extract\ndiscriminative embeddings from these 2D representations. The spatial pyramid\npooling (SPP) module is further used to enhance the feature discriminability,\nin terms of both time and frequency aspects, to obtain the classification label\nof each music clip. Finally, the voting strategy is applied to summarize the\nclassification results from all 3-second music clips. In our experimental\nresults, we demonstrate that the proposed MS-SincResNet outperforms the\nbaseline SincNet and many well-known hand-crafted features.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation aims to make models\ntrained on synthetic data (source domain) adapt to real images (target domain).\nPrevious feature-level adversarial learning methods only consider adapting\nmodels on the high-level semantic features. However, the large domain gap\nbetween source and target domains in the high-level semantic features makes\naccurate adaptation difficult. In this paper, we present the first attempt at\nexplicitly using low-level edge information, which has a small inter-domain\ngap, to guide the transfer of semantic information. To this end, a\nsemantic-edge domain adaptation architecture is proposed, which uses an\nindependent edge stream to process edge information, thereby generating\nhigh-quality semantic boundaries over the target domain. Then, an edge\nconsistency loss is presented to align target semantic predictions with\nproduced semantic boundaries. Moreover, we further propose two entropy\nreweighting methods for semantic adversarial learning and self-supervised\nlearning, respectively, which can further enhance the adaptation performance of\nour architecture. Comprehensive experiments on two UDA benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority of our architecture compared with state-of-the-art\nmethods.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we build up a new intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel model, named the cascaded LoS\nMIMO channel. The proposed channel model consists of a transmitter (Tx) and a\nreceiver (Rx) both equipped with uniform linear arrays (ULAs), and an IRS used\nto enable communications between the transmitter and the receiver through the\nline-of-sight (LoS) links seen by the IRS. To model the reflection of\nelectromagnetic waves at the IRS, we take into account the curvature of the\nwavefront on different reflecting elements (REs), which is distinct from most\nexisting works that take the plane-wave assumption. Based on the established\nmodel, we study the spatial multiplexing capability and input-output mutual\ninformation (MI) of the cascaded LoS MIMO system. We generalize the notion of\nRayleigh distance originally coined for the single-hop MIMO channel to the full\nmultiplexing region (FMR) for the cascaded LoS MIMO channel, where the FMR is,\nroughly speaking, the union of Tx-IRS and IRS-Rx distance pairs that enable\nfull multiplexing communication between the Tx and the Rx. We propose a new\npassive beamforming (PB) strategy named reflective focusing, which aims to\ncoherently superimpose the waves originating from a transmit antenna, reflected\nby the IRS, and focused on a receive antenna. With reflective focusing, we\nderive an inner bound of the FMR, and provide the corresponding orientation\nsettings of the antenna arrays that enable full multiplexing. We further employ\nthe MI to measure the quality of the cascaded LoS MIMO channel, and formulate\nan optimization problem to maximize the MI over PB and antenna array\norientations. We give analytical solutions to the problem under asymptotic\nconditions such as high or low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. For general\ncases, we propose an alternating optimization method to solve the problem.",

    "abstract": "Motion deblurring has witnessed rapid development in recent years, and most\nof the recent methods address it by using deep learning techniques, with the\nhelp of different kinds of prior knowledge. Concerning that deblurring is\nessentially expected to improve the image sharpness, edge information can serve\nas an important prior. However, the edge has not yet been seriously taken into\nconsideration in previous methods when designing deep models. To this end, we\npresent a novel framework that incorporates edge prior knowledge into deep\nmodels, termed Edge Prior Augmented Networks (EPAN). EPAN has a content-based\nmain branch and an edge-based auxiliary branch, which are constructed as a\nContent Deblurring Net (CDN) and an Edge Enhancement Net (EEN), respectively.\nEEN is designed to augment CDN in the deblurring process via an attentive\nfusion mechanism, where edge features are mapped as spatial masks to guide\ncontent features in a feature-based hierarchical manner. An edge-guided loss\nfunction is proposed to further regulate the optimization of EPAN by enforcing\nthe focus on edge areas. Besides, we design a dual-camera-based image capturing\nsetting to build a new dataset, Real Object Motion Blur (ROMB), with paired\nsharp and naturally blurry images of fast-moving cars, so as to better train\nmotion deblurring models and benchmark the capability of motion deblurring\nalgorithms in practice.

During the last decade, matching markets\nhave emerged and grown rapidly through the medium of the Internet. They have\nevolved into a new format, called Online Matching Markets (OMMs), with examples\nranging from crowdsourcing to online recommendations to ridesharing. There are\ntwo features distinguishing OMMs from traditional matching markets. One is the\ndynamic arrival of one side of the market: we refer to these as online agents\nwhile the rest are offline agents. Examples of online and offline agents\ninclude keywords (online) and sponsors (offline) in Google Advertising; workers\n(online) and tasks (offline) in Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT); riders (online)\nand drivers (offline when restricted to a short time window) in ridesharing.\nThe second distinguishing feature of OMMs is the real-time decision-making\nelement. However, studies have shown that the algorithms making decisions in\nthese OMMs leave disparities in the match rates of offline agents. For example,\ntasks in neighborhoods of low socioeconomic status rarely get matched to gig\nworkers, and drivers of certain races/genders get discriminated against in\nmatchmaking. In this paper, we propose online matching algorithms which\noptimize for either individual or group-level fairness among offline agents in\nOMMs. We present two linear-programming (LP) based sampling algorithms, which\nachieve online competitive ratios at least 0.725 for individual fairness\nmaximization (IFM) and 0.719 for group fairness maximization (GFM),\nrespectively.

As of result of this, the risk of children getting\nexposed to adult and violent content on the web also increased. To address this\nissue, an approach to automatically detect violent content in videos is\nproposed in this work. Here, a novel attempt is made also to detect the\ncategory of violence present in a video. A system which can automatically\ndetect violence from both Hollywood movies and videos from the web is extremely\nuseful not only in parental control but also for applications related to movie\nratings, video surveillance, genre classification and so on.\nHere, both audio and visual features are used to detect violence. MFCC\nfeatures are used as audio cues. Blood, Motion, and SentiBank features are used\nas visual cues. Binary SVM classifiers are trained on each of these features to\ndetect violence. Late fusion using a weighted sum of classification scores is\nperformed to get final classification scores for each of the violence class\ntarget by the system. To determine optimal weights for each of the violence\nclasses an approach based on grid search is employed. Publicly available\ndatasets, mainly Violent Scene Detection (VSD), are used for classifier\ntraining, weight calculation, and testing. The performance of the system is\nevaluated on two classification tasks, Multi-Class classification, and Binary\nClassification.

    "abstract": "Five new algorithms were proposed in order to optimize well conditioning of\nstructural matrices. Along with decreasing the size and duration of analyses,\nminimizing analytical errors is a critical factor in the optimal computer\nanalysis of skeletal structures. Appropriate matrices with a greater number of\nzeros (sparse), a well structure, and a well condition are advantageous for\nthis objective. As a result, a problem of optimization with various goals will\nbe addressed. This study seeks to minimize analytical errors such as rounding\nerrors in skeletal structural flexibility matrixes via the use of more\nconsistent and appropriate mathematical methods. These errors become more\npronounced in particular designs with ill-suited flexibility matrixes;\nstructures with varying stiffness are a frequent example of this. Due to the\nusage of weak elements, the flexibility matrix has a large number of\nnon-diagonal terms, resulting in analytical errors. In numerical analysis, the\nill-condition of a matrix may be resolved by moving or substituting rows; this\nstudy examined the definition and execution of these modifications prior to\ncreating the flexibility matrix. Simple topological and algebraic features have\nbeen mostly utilized in this study to find fundamental cycle bases with\nparticular characteristics. In conclusion, appropriately conditioned\nflexibility matrices are obtained, and analytical errors are reduced\naccordingly.",

    "abstract": "Traditional recommendation algorithms develop techniques that can help people\nto choose desirable items. However, in many real-world applications, along with\na set of recommendations, it is also essential to quantify each\nrecommendation's (un)certainty. The conformal recommender system uses the\nexperience of a user to output a set of recommendations, each associated with a\nprecise confidence value. Given a significance level $\\varepsilon$, it provides\na bound $\\varepsilon$ on the probability of making a wrong recommendation. The\nconformal framework uses a key concept called nonconformity measure that\nmeasure the strangeness of an item concerning other items. One of the\nsignificant design challenges of any conformal recommendation framework is\nintegrating nonconformity measure with the recommendation algorithm. In this\npaper, we introduce an inductive variant of a conformal recommender system. We\npropose and analyze different nonconformity measures in the inductive setting.\nWe also provide theoretical proofs on the error-bound and the time complexity.\nExtensive empirical analysis on ten benchmark datasets demonstrates that the\ninductive variant substantially improves the performance in computation time\nwhile preserving the accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been widely adopted in various\nfields. However, existing GANs generally are not able to preserve the manifold\nof data space, mainly due to the simple representation of discriminator for the\nreal/generated data. To address such open challenges, this paper proposes\nManifold-preserved GANs (MaF-GANs), which generalize Wasserstein GANs into\nhigh-dimensional form. Specifically, to improve the representation of data, the\ndiscriminator in MaF-GANs is designed to map data into a high-dimensional\nmanifold. Furthermore, to stabilize the training of MaF-GANs, an operation with\nprecise and universal solution for any K-Lipschitz continuity, called\nTopological Consistency is proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed method\nis justified by both theoretical analysis and empirical results. When adopting\nDCGAN as the backbone on CelebA (256*256), the proposed method achieved 12.43\nFID, which outperforms the state-of-the-art model like Realness GAN (23.51 FID)\nby a large margin.

    "abstract": "Neural networks require careful weight initialization to prevent signals from\nexploding or vanishing. Existing initialization schemes solve this problem in\nspecific cases by assuming that the network has a certain activation function\nor topology. It is difficult to derive such weight initialization strategies,\nand modern architectures therefore often use these same initialization schemes\neven though their assumptions do not hold. This paper introduces AutoInit, a\nweight initialization algorithm that automatically adapts to different neural\nnetwork architectures. By analytically tracking the mean and variance of\nsignals as they propagate through the network, AutoInit is able to\nappropriately scale the weights at each layer to avoid exploding or vanishing\nsignals. Experiments demonstrate that AutoInit improves performance of various\nconvolutional and residual networks across a range of activation function,\ndropout, weight decay, learning rate, and normalizer settings. Further, in\nneural architecture search and activation function meta-learning, AutoInit\nautomatically calculates specialized weight initialization strategies for\nthousands of unique architectures and hundreds of unique activation functions,\nand improves performance in vision, language, tabular, multi-task, and transfer\nlearning scenarios. AutoInit thus serves as an automatic configuration tool\nthat makes design of new neural network architectures more robust.

    "title": "SDTP: Semantic-aware Decoupled Transformer Pyramid for Dense Image  Prediction",
    "abstract": "Although transformer has achieved great progress on computer vision tasks,\nthe scale variation in dense image prediction is still the key challenge. Few\neffective multi-scale techniques are applied in transformer and there are two\nmain limitations in the current methods. On one hand, self-attention module in\nvanilla transformer fails to sufficiently exploit the diversity of semantic\ninformation because of its rigid mechanism. On the other hand, it is hard to\nbuild attention and interaction among different levels due to the heavy\ncomputational burden. To alleviate this problem, we first revisit multi-scale\nproblem in dense prediction, verifying the significance of diverse semantic\nrepresentation and multi-scale interaction, and exploring the adaptation of\ntransformer to pyramidal structure. Inspired by these findings, we propose a\nnovel Semantic-aware Decoupled Transformer Pyramid (SDTP) for dense image\nprediction, consisting of Intra-level Semantic Promotion (ISP), Cross-level\nDecoupled Interaction (CDI) and Attention Refinement Function (ARF). ISP\nexplores the semantic diversity in different receptive space. CDI builds the\nglobal attention and interaction among different levels in decoupled space\nwhich also solves the problem of heavy computation. Besides, ARF is further\nadded to refine the attention in transformer. Experimental results demonstrate\nthe validity and generality of the proposed method, which outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art by a significant margin in dense image prediction tasks.\nFurthermore, the proposed components are all plug-and-play, which can be\nembedded in other methods.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous mobile robots deployed in outdoor environments must reason about\ndifferent types of terrain for both safety (e.g., prefer dirt over mud) and\ndeployer preferences (e.g., prefer dirt path over flower beds). Most existing\nsolutions to this preference-aware path planning problem use semantic\nsegmentation to classify terrain types from camera images, and then ascribe\ncosts to each type. Unfortunately, there are three key limitations of such\napproaches -- they 1) require pre-enumeration of the discrete terrain types, 2)\nare unable to handle hybrid terrain types (e.g., grassy dirt), and 3) require\nexpensive labelled data to train visual semantic segmentation. We introduce\nVisual Representation Learning for Preference-Aware Path Planning (VRL-PAP), an\nalternative approach that overcomes all three limitations: VRL-PAP leverages\nunlabeled human demonstrations of navigation to autonomously generate triplets\nfor learning visual representations of terrain that are viewpoint invariant and\nencode terrain types in a continuous representation space. The learned\nrepresentations are then used along with the same unlabeled human navigation\ndemonstrations to learn a mapping from the representation space to terrain\ncosts. At run time, VRL-PAP maps from images to representations and then\nrepresentations to costs to perform preference-aware path planning. We present\nempirical results from challenging outdoor settings that demonstrate VRL-PAP 1)\nis successfully able to pick paths that reflect demonstrated preferences, 2) is\ncomparable in execution to geometric navigation with a highly detailed manually\nannotated map (without requiring such annotations), 3) is able to generalize to\nnovel terrain types with minimal additional unlabeled demonstrations.",

    "abstract": "Spatially-coupled (SC) codes, known for their threshold saturation phenomenon\nand low-latency windowed decoding algorithms, are ideal for streaming\napplications and data storage systems. SC codes are constructed by partitioning\nan underlying block code, followed by rearranging and concatenating the\npartitioned components in a convolutional manner. The number of partitioned\ncomponents determines the memory of SC codes. In this paper, we investigate the\nrelation between the performance of SC codes and the density distribution of\npartitioning matrices. While adopting higher memories results in improved SC\ncode performance, obtaining finite-length, high-performance SC codes with high\nmemory is known to be computationally challenging. We break this computational\nbottleneck by developing a novel probabilistic framework that obtains (locally)\noptimal density distributions via gradient descent. Starting from random\npartitioning matrices abiding by the obtained distribution, we perform\nlow-complexity optimization algorithms that minimize the number of detrimental\nobjects to construct high-memory, high-performance quasi-cyclic SC codes. We\napply our framework to various objects of interests, from the simplest short\ncycles, to more sophisticated objects such as concatenated cycles aiming at\nfiner-grained optimization.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nmethod for graph-based learning tasks. However, it still remains prohibitively\nchallenging to inference GNNs over large graph datasets, limiting their\napplication to large-scale real-world tasks. While end-to-end jointly\noptimizing GNNs and their accelerators is promising in boosting GNNs' inference\nefficiency and expediting the design process, it is still underexplored due to\nthe vast and distinct design spaces of GNNs and their accelerators. In this\nwork, we propose G-CoS, a GNN and accelerator co-search framework that can\nautomatically search for matched GNN structures and accelerators to maximize\nboth task accuracy and acceleration efficiency. Specifically, GCoS integrates\ntwo major enabling components: (1) a generic GNN accelerator search space which\nis applicable to various GNN structures and (2) a one-shot GNN and accelerator\nco-search algorithm that enables simultaneous and efficient search for optimal\nGNN structures and their matched accelerators. To the best of our knowledge,\nG-CoS is the first co-search framework for GNNs and their accelerators.\nExtensive experiments and ablation studies show that the GNNs and accelerators\ngenerated by G-CoS consistently outperform SOTA GNNs and GNN accelerators in\nterms of both task accuracy and hardware efficiency, while only requiring a few\nhours for the end-to-end generation of the best matched GNNs and their\naccelerators.",

These\nsentiment-aware intelligent systems are driven by language models which broadly\nfall into two paradigms: 1. Lexicon-based and 2. Contextual. Although recent\ncontextual models are increasingly dominant, we still see demand for\nlexicon-based models because of their interpretability and ease of use. For\nexample, lexicon-based models allow researchers to readily determine which\nwords and phrases contribute most to a change in measured sentiment. A\nchallenge for any lexicon-based approach is that the lexicon needs to be\nroutinely expanded with new words and expressions. Crowdsourcing annotations\nfor semantic dictionaries may be an expensive and time-consuming task. Here, we\npropose two models for predicting sentiment scores to augment semantic lexicons\nat a relatively low cost using word embeddings and transfer learning. Our first\nmodel establishes a baseline employing a simple and shallow neural network\ninitialized with pre-trained word embeddings using a non-contextual approach.\nOur second model improves upon our baseline, featuring a deep Transformer-based\nnetwork that brings to bear word definitions to estimate their lexical\npolarity.

    "title": "Change of human mobility during COVID-19: A United States case study",
    "abstract": "With the onset of COVID-19 and the resulting shelter in place guidelines\ncombined with remote working practices, human mobility in 2020 has been\ndramatically impacted. Existing studies typically examine whether mobility in\nspecific localities increases or decreases at specific points in time and\nrelate these changes to certain pandemic and policy events. In this paper, we\nstudy mobility change in the US through a five-step process using mobility\nfootprint data. (Step 1) Propose the delta Time Spent in Public Places\n(Delta-TSPP) as a measure to quantify daily changes in mobility for each US\ncounty from 2019-2020. (Step 2) Conduct Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to\nreduce the Delta-TSPP time series of each county to lower-dimensional latent\ncomponents of change in mobility. (Step 3) Conduct clustering analysis to find\ncounties that exhibit similar latent components. (Step 4) Investigate local and\nglobal spatial autocorrelation for each component. (Step 5) Conduct correlation\nanalysis to investigate how various population characteristics and behavior\ncorrelate with mobility patterns. Results show that by describing each county\nas a linear combination of the three latent components, we can explain 59% of\nthe variation in mobility trends across all US counties. Specifically, change\nin mobility in 2020 for US counties can be explained as a combination of three\nlatent components: 1) long-term reduction in mobility, 2) no change in\nmobility, and 3) short-term reduction in mobility. We observe significant\ncorrelations between the three latent components of mobility change and various\npopulation characteristics, including political leaning, population, COVID-19\ncases and deaths, and unemployment. We find that our analysis provides a\ncomprehensive understanding of mobility change in response to the COVID-19\npandemic.",

To solve this problem, we\nrevisit traditional watermarking in advanced machine learning settings.

Recently, mainstream approaches perform this task\nthrough adversarial learning, yet still suffer from two limitations. First,\nthey mainly align marginal distribution by unsupervised cross-domain feature\nmatching, and ignore each feature's categorical and positional information that\ncan be exploited for conditional alignment; Second, they treat all classes as\nequally important for transferring cross-domain knowledge and ignore that\ndifferent classes usually have different transferability. In this paper, we\npropose a joint adaptive detection framework (JADF) to address the above\nchallenges. First, an end-to-end joint adversarial adaptation framework for\nobject detection is proposed, which aligns both marginal and conditional\ndistributions between domains without introducing any extra hyperparameter.\nNext, to consider the transferability of each object class, a metric for\nclass-wise transferability assessment is proposed, which is incorporated into\nthe JADF objective for domain adaptation. Further, an extended study from\nunsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) to unsupervised few-shot domain adaptation\n(UFDA) is conducted, where only a few unlabeled training images are available\nin unlabeled target domain.

Some\nworks use the hierarchy of relations for knowledge transfer to long-tail\nrelations.

In this work, we propose a novel model to enrich\ndistantly-supervised sentences with entity types.

Notably, the dimension,\nthe minimum distance of some $q$-ary BCH codes with length $q+1$, and their\nduals are determined in this paper. The dual codes of the narrow-sense\nantiprimitive BCH codes derived in this paper include almost MDS codes.\nFurthermore, the classification of $\\mathrm{PGL} (2, p^m)$-invariant codes over\n$\\mathrm{GF} (p^h)$ is completed.\nAs an application of this result, the $p$-ranks of all incidence structures\ninvariant under the projective general linear group $\\mathrm{ PGL }(2, p^m)$\nare determined.\nFurthermore, infinite families of narrow-sense BCH codes admitting a\n$3$-transitive automorphism group are obtained.\nVia these BCH codes, a coding-theory approach to constructing the Witt\nspherical geometry designs is presented.\nThe BCH codes proposed in this paper are good candidates for permutation\ndecoding, as they have a relatively large group of automorphisms.",

    "abstract": "Inspired by the complementarity between conventional frame-based and\nbio-inspired event-based cameras, we propose a multi-modal based approach to\nfuse visual cues from the frame- and event-domain to enhance the single object\ntracking performance, especially in degraded conditions (e.g., scenes with high\ndynamic range, low light, and fast-motion objects). The proposed approach can\neffectively and adaptively combine meaningful information from both domains.\nOur approach's effectiveness is enforced by a novel designed cross-domain\nattention schemes, which can effectively enhance features based on self- and\ncross-domain attention schemes; The adaptiveness is guarded by a specially\ndesigned weighting scheme, which can adaptively balance the contribution of the\ntwo domains. To exploit event-based visual cues in single-object tracking, we\nconstruct a large-scale frame-event-based dataset, which we subsequently employ\nto train a novel frame-event fusion based model. Extensive experiments show\nthat the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art frame-based tracking\nmethods by at least 10.4% and 11.9% in terms of representative success rate and\nprecision rate, respectively. Besides, the effectiveness of each key component\nof our approach is evidenced by our thorough ablation study.",

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) is a revolutionizing approach to\nprovide cost-effective yet energy-efficient communications. The transmit\nbeamforming of the base station (BS) and discrete phase shifts of the RIS are\njointly optimized to provide high quality of service. However, existing works\nignore the high dependence between the large number of phase shifts and\nestimate them separately, consequently, easily getting trapped into local\noptima. To investigate the number and distribution of local optima, we conduct\na fitness landscape analysis on the sum rate maximization problems. Two\nlandscape features, the fitness distribution correlation and autocorrelation,\nare employed to investigate the ruggedness of landscape. The investigation\nresults indicate that the landscape exhibits a rugged, multi-modal structure,\ni.e., has many local peaks, particularly in the cases with large-scale RISs. To\nhandle the multi-modal landscape structure, we propose a novel niching genetic\nalgorithm to solve the sum rate maximization problem. Particularly, a niching\ntechnique, nearest-better clustering, is incorporated to partition the\npopulation into several neighborhood species, thereby locating multiple local\noptima and enhance the global search ability. We also present a minimum species\nsize to further improve the convergence speed. Simulation results demonstrate\nthat our method achieves significant capacity gains compared to existing\nalgorithms, particularly in the cases with large-scale RISs.",

    "abstract": "Applications based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have grown exponentially in\nthe past decade. To match their increasing computational needs, several\nNon-Volatile Memory (NVM) crossbar-based accelerators have been proposed. Apart\nfrom improved energy efficiency and performance, these approximate hardware\nalso possess intrinsic robustness for defense against Adversarial Attacks,\nwhich is an important security concern for DNNs. Prior works have focused on\nquantifying this intrinsic robustness for vanilla networks, that is DNNs\ntrained on unperturbed inputs. However, adversarial training of DNNs is the\nbenchmark technique for robustness, and sole reliance on intrinsic robustness\nof the hardware may not be sufficient. In this work, we explore the design of\nrobust DNNs through the amalgamation of adversarial training and the intrinsic\nrobustness offered by NVM crossbar-based analog hardware. First, we study the\nnoise stability of such networks on unperturbed inputs and observe that\ninternal activations of adversarially trained networks have lower\nSignal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and are sensitive to noise than vanilla networks.\nAs a result, they suffer significantly higher performance degradation due to\nthe non-ideal computations; on an average 2x accuracy drop. On the other hand,\nfor adversarial images generated using Projected-Gradient-Descent (PGD)\nWhite-Box attacks, ResNet-10/20 adversarially trained on CIFAR-10/100 display a\n5-10% gain in robust accuracy due to the underlying NVM crossbar when the\nattack epsilon ($\\epsilon_{attack}$, the degree of input perturbations) is\ngreater than the epsilon of the adversarial training ($\\epsilon_{train}$). Our\nresults indicate that implementing adversarially trained networks on analog\nhardware requires careful calibration between hardware non-idealities and\n$\\epsilon_{train}$ to achieve optimum robustness and performance.",

    "abstract": "For years, adversarial training has been extensively studied in natural\nlanguage processing (NLP) settings. The main goal is to make models robust so\nthat similar inputs derive in semantically similar outcomes, which is not a\ntrivial problem since there is no objective measure of semantic similarity in\nlanguage. Previous works use an external pre-trained NLP model to tackle this\nchallenge, introducing an extra training stage with huge memory consumption\nduring training. However, the recent popular approach of contrastive learning\nin language processing hints a convenient way of obtaining such similarity\nrestrictions. The main advantage of the contrastive learning approach is that\nit aims for similar data points to be mapped close to each other and further\nfrom different ones in the representation space. In this work, we propose\nadversarial training with contrastive learning (ATCL) to adversarially train a\nlanguage processing task using the benefits of contrastive learning. The core\nidea is to make linear perturbations in the embedding space of the input via\nfast gradient methods (FGM) and train the model to keep the original and\nperturbed representations close via contrastive learning. In NLP experiments,\nwe applied ATCL to language modeling and neural machine translation tasks. The\nresults show not only an improvement in the quantitative (perplexity and BLEU)\nscores when compared to the baselines, but ATCL also achieves good qualitative\nresults in the semantic level for both tasks without using a pre-trained model.",

Machine learning and hybrid techniques for this\nprediction rely on informative metrics that are sensitive to pertinent but\noften subtle influences. For atmospheric dynamics, a critical part of the\nclimate system, the \"eyeball metric\", i.e. a visual inspection by an expert, is\ncurrently still the gold standard. However, it cannot be used as metric in\nmachine learning systems where an algorithmic description is required.\nMotivated by the success of intermediate neural network activations as basis\nfor learned metrics, e.g. in computer vision, we present a novel,\nself-supervised representation learning approach specifically designed for\natmospheric dynamics. Our approach, called AtmoDist, trains a neural network on\na simple, auxiliary task: predicting the temporal distance between elements of\na shuffled sequence of atmospheric fields (e.g. the components of the wind\nfield from a reanalysis or simulation). The task forces the network to learn\nimportant intrinsic aspects of the data as activations in its layers and from\nthese hence a discriminative metric can be obtained. We demonstrate this by\nusing AtmoDist to define a metric for GAN-based super resolution of vorticity\nand divergence. Our upscaled data matches closely the true statistics of a high\nresolution reference and it significantly outperform the state-of-the-art based\non mean squared error. Since AtmoDist is unsupervised, only requires a temporal\nsequence of fields, and uses a simple auxiliary task, it can be used in a wide\nrange of applications that aim to understand and mitigate climate change.",

    "abstract": "We show that the `optimal' use of the parallel composition theorem\ncorresponds to finding the size of the largest subset of queries that `overlap'\non the data domain, a quantity we call the \\emph{maximum overlap} of the\nqueries. It has previously been shown that a certain instance of this problem,\nformulated in terms of determining the sensitivity of the queries, is NP-hard,\nbut also that it is possible to use graph-theoretic algorithms, such as finding\nthe maximum clique, to approximate query sensitivity. In this paper, we\nconsider a significant generalization of the aforementioned instance which\nencompasses both a wider range of differentially private mechanisms and a\nbroader class of queries. We show that for a particular class of predicate\nqueries, determining if they are disjoint can be done in time polynomial in the\nnumber of attributes. For this class, we show that the maximum overlap problem\nremains NP-hard as a function of the number of queries. However, we show that\nefficient approximate solutions exist by relating maximum overlap to the clique\nand chromatic numbers of a certain graph determined by the queries. The link to\nchromatic number allows us to use more efficient approximate algorithms, which\ncannot be done for the clique number as it may underestimate the privacy\nbudget. Our approach is defined in the general setting of $f$-differential\nprivacy, which subsumes standard pure differential privacy and Gaussian\ndifferential privacy. We prove the parallel composition theorem for\n$f$-differential privacy. We evaluate our approach on synthetic and real-world\ndata sets of queries. We show that the approach can scale to large domain sizes\n(up to $10^{20000}$), and that its application can reduce the noise added to\nquery answers by up to 60\\%.",

    "abstract": "Trajectory optimization of sensing robots to actively gather information of\ntargets has received much attention in the past. It is well-known that under\nthe assumption of linear Gaussian target dynamics and sensor models the\nstochastic Active Information Acquisition problem is equivalent to a\ndeterministic optimal control problem. However, the above-mentioned assumptions\nregarding the target dynamic model are limiting. In real-world scenarios, the\ntarget may be subject to disturbances whose models or statistical properties\nare hard or impossible to obtain. Typical scenarios include abrupt maneuvers,\njumping disturbances due to interactions with the environment, anomalous\nmisbehaviors due to system faults/attacks, etc. Motivated by the above\nconsiderations, in this paper we consider targets whose dynamic models are\nsubject to arbitrary unknown inputs whose models or statistical properties are\nnot assumed to be available. In particular, with the aid of an unknown input\ndecoupled filter, we formulate the sensor trajectory planning problem to track\nevolution of the target state and analyse the resulting performance for both\nthe state and unknown input evolution tracking. Inspired by concepts of Reduced\nValue Iteration, a suboptimal solution that expands a search tree via Forward\nValue Iteration with informativeness-based pruning is proposed. Concrete\nsuboptimality performance guarantees for tracking both the state and the\nunknown input are established. Numerical simulations of a target tracking\nexample are presented to compare the proposed solution with a greedy policy.",

In order to increase robustness\nunder occlusions, we followed two approaches. The first is image inpainting\nusing the pre-trained pluralistic image completion network. The second is\nCutmix, a regularization strategy consisting of mixing training images and\ntheir labels using rectangular patches, making the classifier more robust\nagainst input corruptions. Both strategies revealed effective and interesting\nresults were observed.

    "title": "Embedding Model Based Fast Meta Learning for Downlink Beamforming  Adaptation",
    "abstract": "This paper studies the fast adaptive beamforming for the multiuser\nmultiple-input single-output downlink. Existing deep learning-based approaches\nassume that training and testing channels follow the same distribution which\ncauses task mismatch, when the testing environment changes. Although meta\nlearning can deal with the task mismatch, it relies on labelled data and incurs\nhigh complexity in the pre-training and fine tuning stages. We propose a simple\nyet effective adaptive framework to solve the mismatch issue, which trains an\nembedding model as a transferable feature extractor, followed by fitting the\nsupport vector regression. Compared to the existing meta learning algorithm,\nour method does not necessarily need labelled data in the pre-training and does\nnot need fine-tuning of the pre-trained model in the adaptation. The\neffectiveness of the proposed method is verified through two well-known\napplications, i.e., the signal to interference plus noise ratio balancing\nproblem and the sum rate maximization problem. Furthermore, we extend our\nproposed method to online scenarios in non-stationary environments. Simulation\nresults demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm in terms of both\nperformance and complexity. The proposed framework can also be applied to\ngeneral radio resource management problems.",

We probe BERT based\nlanguage models (BERT, RoBERTa) trained on spoken transcripts to investigate\nits ability to understand multifarious properties in absence of any speech\ncues. Empirical results indicate that LM is surprisingly good at capturing\nconversational properties such as pause prediction and overtalk detection from\nlexical tokens.

    "abstract": "Language models are generally trained on short, truncated input sequences,\nwhich limits their ability to use discourse-level information present in\nlong-range context to improve their predictions. Recent efforts to improve the\nefficiency of self-attention have led to a proliferation of long-range\nTransformer language models, which can process much longer sequences than\nmodels of the past. However, the ways in which such models take advantage of\nthe long-range context remain unclear.

Our results reveal that providing long-range context (i.e., beyond\nthe previous 2K tokens) to these models only improves their predictions on a\nsmall set of tokens (e.g., those that can be copied from the distant context)\nand does not help at all for sentence-level prediction tasks. Finally, we\ndiscover that PG-19 contains a variety of different document types and domains,\nand that long-range context helps most for literary novels (as opposed to\ntextbooks or magazines).",

What is more,\ncomic evaluation is a prominent challenge as common metrics such as Inception\nScore will not perform comparably, as they are designed to work on photos. In\nthis paper: 1. We implement ComicGAN, a novel text-to-comic pipeline based on a\ntext-to-image GAN that synthesizes comics according to text descriptions. 2.

ComicGAN has two novel features: (i) text description\ncreation from labels via permutation and augmentation, and (ii) custom image\nencoding with Convolutional Neural Networks. We extensively evaluate the\nproposed ComicGAN in two scenarios, namely image generation from descriptions,\nand image generation from dialogue. Our results on 1000 Dilbert comic panels\nand 6000 descriptions show synthetic comic panels from text inputs resemble\noriginal Dilbert panels.

A huge literature exists on this topic. A\ncommon approach is to model KBs as graphs decorated with labels and reduce the\nproblem of KB matching to that of matching these two elements, \\textit{viz.},\nlabels and structure of the graph.

How to get the\ntrade-off effectively is an open question, where current approaches of\nutilizing attention schemes or very deep models result in complex models with\nlarge memory consumption. Compared with the popularly-used convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) with fixed square kernels, graph convolutional network (GCN) can\nexplicitly utilize correlations between adjacent land covers and conduct\nflexible convolution on arbitrarily irregular image regions. However, the\nproblems of large variations of target scales and blurred boundary cannot be\neasily solved by GCN, while densely connected atrous convolution network\n(DenseAtrousCNet) with multi-scale atrous convolution can expand the receptive\nfields and obtain image global information.

Then, we propose a\nnovel framework, termed BLur-Aware DEblurring network (BladeNet), which\ncontains three components: the Local Blur Synthesis module generates locally\nblurred training pairs, the Local Blur Perception module automatically captures\nthe locally blurred region and the Blur-guided Spatial Attention module guides\nthe deblurring network with spatial attention. This framework is flexible such\nthat it can be combined with many existing SotA algorithms. We carry out\nextensive experiments on REDS and LODE datasets showing that BladeNet improves\nPSNR by 2.5dB over SotAs for local deblurring while keeping comparable\nperformance for global deblurring. We will publish the dataset and codes.",

Irrespective of the progress made in SSL, its generalizability\nhas not been studied extensively. In this article, we perform a deeper analysis\nof the generalizability of pretrained SSL and SL representations by conducting\na domain-based study for transfer learning classification tasks. The\nrepresentations are learned from the ImageNet source data, which are then\nfine-tuned using two types of target datasets: similar to the source dataset,\nand significantly different from the source dataset. We study generalizability\nof the SSL and SL-based models via their prediction accuracy as well as\nprediction confidence. In addition to this, we analyze the attribution of the\nfinal convolutional layer of these models to understand how they reason about\nthe semantic identity of the data. We show that the SSL representations are\nmore generalizable as compared to the SL representations. We explain the\ngeneralizability of the SSL representations by investigating its invariance\nproperty, which is shown to be better than that observed in the SL\nrepresentations.",

    "abstract": "Instagram has been increasingly used as a source of information especially\namong the youth. As a result, political figures now leverage the platform to\nspread opinions and political agenda. We here analyze online discussions on\nInstagram, notably in political topics, from a network perspective.\nSpecifically, we investigate the emergence of communities of co-commenters,\nthat is, groups of users who often interact by commenting on the same posts and\nmay be driving the ongoing online discussions. In particular, we are interested\nin salient co-interactions, i.e., interactions of co-commenters that occur more\noften than expected by chance and under independent behavior. Unlike casual and\naccidental co-interactions which normally happen in large volumes, salient\nco-interactions are key elements driving the online discussions and,\nultimately, the information dissemination. We base our study on the analysis of\n10 weeks of data centered around major elections in Brazil and Italy, following\nboth politicians and other celebrities. We extract and characterize the\ncommunities of co-commenters in terms of topological structure, properties of\nthe discussions carried out by community members, and how some community\nproperties, notably community membership and topics, evolve over time. We show\nthat communities discussing political topics tend to be more engaged in the\ndebate by writing longer comments, using more emojis, hashtags and negative\nwords than in other subjects. Also, communities built around political\ndiscussions tend to be more dynamic, although top commenters remain active and\npreserve community membership over time. Moreover, we observe a great diversity\nin discussed topics over time: whereas some topics attract attention only\nmomentarily, others, centered around more fundamental political discussions,\nremain consistently active over time.",

Current works in the\nliterature formulate it as a Sense-And-Avoid (SAA) problem and address it by\neither developing new sensing capabilities or small form-factor processors.\nHowever, the SAA, with the high-speed operation, remains an open problem. The\nsignificant complexity arises due to the computational latency, which is\ncritical for fast-moving quadcopters. In this paper, a novel Fast Obstacle\nAvoidance Motion (FOAM) algorithm is proposed to perform SAA operations. FOAM\nis a low-latency perception-based algorithm that uses multi-sensor fusion of a\nmonocular camera and a 2-D LIDAR. A 2-D probabilistic occupancy map of the\nsensing region is generated to estimate a free space for avoiding obstacles.\nAlso, a local planner is used to navigate the high-speed quadcopter towards a\ngiven target location while avoiding obstacles. The performance evaluation of\nFOAM is evaluated in simulated environments in Gazebo and AIRSIM. Real-time\nimplementation of the same has been presented in outdoor environments using a\ncustom-designed quadcopter operating at a speed of $4.5$ m/s.

Moreover, previous works simply replace\nthe embedding layer of the pre-trained language model with the acoustic\nfeatures, which may cause the catastrophic forgetting problem. In this work, we\nintroduce Wav-BERT, a cooperative acoustic and linguistic representation\nlearning method to fuse and utilize the contextual information of speech and\ntext. Specifically, we unify a pre-trained acoustic model (wav2vec 2.0) and a\nlanguage model (BERT) into an end-to-end trainable framework. A Representation\nAggregation Module is designed to aggregate acoustic and linguistic\nrepresentation, and an Embedding Attention Module is introduced to incorporate\nacoustic information into BERT, which can effectively facilitate the\ncooperation of two pre-trained models and thus boost the representation\nlearning.

Learning how to perform\nthis task, however, is challenging, since task-relevant grasp labels are hard\nto define and annotate. There is also yet no consensus on proper\nrepresentations for modeling or off-the-shelf tools for performing\ntask-relevant grasps. This work proposes a framework to learn task-relevant\ngrasping for industrial objects without the need of time-consuming real-world\ndata collection or manual annotation. To achieve this, the entire framework is\ntrained solely in simulation, including supervised training with synthetic\nlabel generation and self-supervised, hand-object interaction. In the context\nof this framework, this paper proposes a novel, object-centric canonical\nrepresentation at the category level, which allows establishing dense\ncorrespondence across object instances and transferring task-relevant grasps to\nnovel instances. Extensive experiments on task-relevant grasping of\ndensely-cluttered industrial objects are conducted in both simulation and\nreal-world setups, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.\nCode and data will be released upon acceptance at\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/catgrasp.",

We propose a Hierarchical Dance Video\nRecognition framework (HDVR). HDVR estimates 2D pose sequences, tracks dancers,\nand then simultaneously estimates corresponding 3D poses and 3D-to-2D imaging\nparameters, without requiring ground truth for 3D poses. Unlike most methods\nthat work on a single person, our tracking works on multiple dancers, under\nocclusions. From the estimated 3D pose sequence, HDVR extracts body part\nmovements, and therefrom dance genre. The resulting hierarchical dance\nrepresentation is explainable to experts. To overcome noise and interframe\ncorrespondence ambiguities, we enforce spatial and temporal motion smoothness\nand photometric continuity over time. We use an LSTM network to extract 3D\nmovement subsequences from which we recognize the dance genre. For experiments,\nwe have identified 154 movement types, of 16 body parts, and assembled a new\nUniversity of Illinois Dance (UID) Dataset, containing 1143 video clips of 9\ngenres covering 30 hours, annotated with movement and genre labels.

    "abstract": "Rolling bearings are subject to various faults due to its long-time operation\nunder harsh environment, which will lead to unexpected breakdown of machinery\nsystem and cause severe accidents. Deep learning methods recently have gained\ngrowing interests and extensively applied in the data-driven bearing fault\ndiagnosis. However, current deep learning methods perform the bearing fault\ndiagnosis in the form of deterministic classification, which overlook the\nuncertainties that inevitably exist in actual practice. To tackle this issue,\nin this research we develop a probabilistic fault diagnosis framework that can\naccount for the uncertainty effect in prediction, which bears practical\nsignificance. This framework fully leverages the probabilistic feature of\nGaussian process classifier (GPC). To facilitate the establishment of\nhigh-fidelity GPC, the tailored feature extraction with dimensionality\nreduction method can be optimally determined through the cross validation-based\ngrid search upon a prespecified method pool consisting of various kernel\nprincipal component analysis (KPCA) methods and stacked autoencoder. This\nstrategy can ensure the complex nonlinear relations between the features and\nfaults to be adequately characterized. Furthermore, the sensor fusion concept\nis adopted to enhance the diagnosis performance. As compared with the\ntraditional deep learning methods, this proposed framework usually requires\nless labeled data and less effort for parameter tuning. Systematic case studies\nusing the publicly accessible experimental rolling bearing dataset are carried\nout to validate this new framework.

    "title": "Harnessing the Power of Ego Network Layers for Link Prediction in Online  Social Networks",
    "abstract": "Being able to recommend links between users in online social networks is\nimportant for users to connect with like-minded individuals as well as for the\nplatforms themselves and third parties leveraging social media information to\ngrow their business. Predictions are typically based on unsupervised or\nsupervised learning, often leveraging simple yet effective graph topological\ninformation, such as the number of common neighbors. However, we argue that\nricher information about personal social structure of individuals might lead to\nbetter predictions. In this paper, we propose to leverage well-established\nsocial cognitive theories to improve link prediction performance. According to\nthese theories, individuals arrange their social relationships along, on\naverage, five concentric circles of decreasing intimacy. We postulate that\nrelationships in different circles have different importance in predicting new\nlinks. In order to validate this claim, we focus on popular feature-extraction\nprediction algorithms (both unsupervised and supervised) and we extend them to\ninclude social-circles awareness. We validate the prediction performance of\nthese circle-aware algorithms against several benchmarks (including their\nbaseline versions as well as node-embedding- and GNN-based link prediction),\nleveraging two Twitter datasets comprising a community of video gamers and\ngeneric users. We show that social-awareness generally provides significant\nimprovements in the prediction performance, beating also state-of-the-art\nsolutions like node2vec and SEAL, and without increasing the computational\ncomplexity. Finally, we show that social-awareness can be used in place of\nusing a classifier (which may be costly or impractical) for targeting a\nspecific category of users.",

    "abstract": "This review summarizes papers which analyze impact of self-citation on\nresearch evaluation. We introduce a generalized definition of self-citation and\nits variants: author, institutional, country, journal, discipline, publisher\nself-citation. Formulae of the basic self-citation measures are given, namely\nself-citing and self-cited rates. World literature on author, institutional,\ncountry and journal self-citation is studied in more detail. Current views on\nthe role and impact of self-citation are compiled and analyzed. It is found\nthat there is a general consensus on some points: (a) pathological is as\nexcessive self-citation so its total absence; (b) self-citation has low impact\non large science units but may be critical for analysis of individual\nresearchers; (c) share of self-citations is generally higher for units with low\nbibliometric performance, while top scientists, institutions, journals receive\nthe majority of their citations from outside. This review also considers how\nbibliometric instruments and databases respond to challenge of possible\nmanipulation by self-citations and how they correct bibliometric indicators\ncalculated by them.

Hence, there is a need to understand the pathophysiology of AF\nand stroke in HCM. In this retrospective study, we develop and apply a\ndata-driven, machine learning based method to identify AF cases, and clinical\nand imaging features associated with AF, using electronic health record data.\nHCM patients with documented paroxysmal/persistent/permanent AF (n = 191) were\nconsidered AF cases, and the remaining patients in sinus rhythm (n = 640) were\ntagged as No-AF. We evaluated 93 clinical variables and the most informative\nvariables useful for distinguishing AF from No-AF cases were selected based on\nthe 2-sample t test and the information gain criterion. We identified 18 highly\ninformative variables that are positively (n = 11) and negatively (n = 7)\ncorrelated with AF in HCM. Next, patient records were represented via these 18\nvariables. Data imbalance resulting from the relatively low number of AF cases\nwas addressed via a combination of oversampling and under-sampling strategies.\nWe trained and tested multiple classifiers under this sampling approach,\nshowing effective classification.

    "abstract": "Capsule networks use routing algorithms to flow information between\nconsecutive layers. In the existing routing procedures, capsules produce\npredictions (termed votes) for capsules of the next layer. In a nutshell, the\nnext-layer capsule's input is a weighted sum over all the votes it receives. In\nthis paper, we propose non-iterative cluster routing for capsule networks. In\nthe proposed cluster routing, capsules produce vote clusters instead of\nindividual votes for next-layer capsules, and each vote cluster sends its\ncentroid to a next-layer capsule. Generally speaking, the next-layer capsule's\ninput is a weighted sum over the centroid of each vote cluster it receives. The\ncentroid that comes from a cluster with a smaller variance is assigned a larger\nweight in the weighted sum process. Compared with the state-of-the-art capsule\nnetworks, the proposed capsule networks achieve the best accuracy on the\nFashion-MNIST and SVHN datasets with fewer parameters, and achieve the best\naccuracy on the smallNORB and CIFAR-10 datasets with a moderate number of\nparameters. The proposed capsule networks also produce capsules with\ndisentangled representation and generalize well to images captured at novel\nviewpoints. The proposed capsule networks also preserve 2D spatial information\nof an input image in the capsule channels: if the capsule channels are rotated,\nthe object reconstructed from these channels will be rotated by the same\ntransformation.

A myriad of commercial toys with a\nsimilar mobility improvement purpose are into the market; however, there is no\none that bets for an intelligent autonomous movement, as they perform simple\nyet repetitive trajectories in the best of the cases. Two crawling toys -- one\nin representation of \"Baby Robot\" -- were tested in a real environment with\nrespect to regular toys in order to check how they improved the toddlers\nmobility. These real-life experiments were conducted with our proposed robot in\na kindergarten, where a group of children interacted with the toys. Significant\nimprovement in the motion skills of participants were detected.",

Thus, they\nare widely applicable in various domains where data is sensitive, such as\nlarge-scale medical image classification, internet-of-medical-things, and\ncross-organization phishing email detection. SFL is developed on the confluence\npoint of FL and SL. It brings the best of FL and SL by providing parallel\nclient-side machine learning model updates from the FL paradigm and a higher\nlevel of model privacy (while training) by splitting the model between the\nclients and server coming from SL. However, SFL has communication and\ncomputation overhead at the client-side due to the requirement of client-side\nmodel synchronization. For the resource-constrained client-side, removal of\nsuch requirements is required to gain efficiency in the learning. In this\nregard, this paper studies SFL without client-side model synchronization. The\nresulting architecture is known as Multi-head Split Learning. Our empirical\nstudies considering the ResNet18 model on MNIST data under IID data\ndistribution among distributed clients find that Multi-head Split Learning is\nfeasible. Its performance is comparable to the SFL. Moreover, SFL provides only\n1%-2% better accuracy than Multi-head Split Learning on the MNIST test set. To\nfurther strengthen our results, we study the Multi-head Split Learning with\nvarious client-side model portions and its impact on the overall performance.\nTo this end, our results find a minimal impact on the overall performance of\nthe model.",

The paper\nconstructs a simple Heterodox Model of a closed economy, in which the\nconsumption and the production parts are clearly separated and yet coupled\nthrough a tatonnement process. The equilibria of this process correspond\ndirectly with those of a related Arrow-Debreu model. The formulation allows us\nto identify the combinatorial data which link parameters of the economic system\nwith its equilibria, in particular, the impact of consumer preferences on\nwages. The Heterodox model also allows the formulation and explicit\nconstruction of the consumer choice game, where individual utilities serve as\nthe strategies with total or relative wages as the pay-offs. We illustrate,\nthrough two examples, the mathematical details of the consumer choice game. We\nshow that consumer preferences, expressed through modified utility functions,\ndo indeed percolate through the economy, and influences not only prices but\nalso production and wages.

However, these benefits are offset by considerable\ncybersecurity concerns that arise due to inherent vulnerabilities, which hinder\nIoT-based systems' Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. Security\nvulnerabilities can be detected through the application of penetration testing,\nand specifically, a subset of the information-gathering stage, known as\nvulnerability identification. Yet, existing penetration testing solutions can\nnot discover zero-day vulnerabilities from IoT environments, due to the\ndiversity of generated data, hardware constraints, and environmental\ncomplexity. Thus, it is imperative to develop effective penetration testing\nsolutions for the detection of vulnerabilities in smart IoT environments. In\nthis paper, we propose a deep learning-based penetration testing framework,\nnamely Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network-Enabled Vulnerability\nIdentification (LSTM-EVI). We utilize this framework through a novel\ncybersecurity-oriented testbed, which is a smart airport-based testbed\ncomprised of both physical and virtual elements.

    "abstract": "A deep clustering network is desired for data streams because of its aptitude\nin extracting natural features thus bypassing the laborious feature engineering\nstep. While automatic construction of the deep networks in streaming\nenvironments remains an open issue, it is also hindered by the expensive\nlabeling cost of data streams rendering the increasing demand for unsupervised\napproaches. This paper presents an unsupervised approach of deep clustering\nnetwork construction on the fly via simultaneous deep learning and clustering\ntermed Autonomous Deep Clustering Network (ADCN). It combines the feature\nextraction layer and autonomous fully connected layer in which both network\nwidth and depth are self-evolved from data streams based on the bias-variance\ndecomposition of reconstruction loss. The self-clustering mechanism is\nperformed in the deep embedding space of every fully connected layer while the\nfinal output is inferred via the summation of cluster prediction score.\nFurther, a latent-based regularization is incorporated to resolve the\ncatastrophic forgetting issue. A rigorous numerical study has shown that ADCN\nproduces better performance compared to its counterparts while offering fully\nautonomous construction of ADCN structure in streaming environments with the\nabsence of any labeled samples for model updates.

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has birthed a wealth of information through many\npublicly accessible sources, such as news outlets and social media. However,\ngathering and understanding the content can be difficult due to inaccuracies or\ninconsistencies between the different sources. To alleviate this challenge in\nAustralia, a team of 48 student volunteers developed an open-source COVID-19\ninformation dashboard to provide accurate, reliable, and real-time COVID-19\ninformation for Australians. The students developed this software while working\nunder legislative restrictions that required social isolation. The goal of this\nstudy is to characterize the experiences of the students throughout the\nproject. We conducted an online survey completed by 39 of the volunteering\nstudents contributing to the COVID-19 dashboard project. Our results indicate\nthat playing a positive role in the COVID-19 crisis and learning new skills and\ntechnologies were the most cited motivating factors for the students to\nparticipate in the project. While working on the project, some students\nstruggled to maintain a work-life balance due to working from home. However,\nthe students generally did not express strong sentiment towards general project\nchallenges. The students expressed more strongly that data collection was a\nsignificant challenge as it was difficult to collect reliable, accurate, and\nup-to-date data from various government sources. The students have been able to\nmitigate these challenges by establishing a systematic data collection process\nin the team, leveraging frequent and clear communication through text, and\nappreciating and encouraging each other's efforts. By participating in the\nproject, the students boosted their technical (e.g., front-end development) and\nnon-technical (e.g., task prioritization) skills. Our study discusses several\nimplications for students, educators, and policymakers.",

    "abstract": "The ability to autonomously navigate in unknown environments is important for\nmobile robots. The map is the core component to achieve this. Most map\nrepresentations rely on drift-free state estimation and provide a global metric\nmap to navigate. However, in large-scale real-world applications, it's hard to\nprohibit drifts and compose a globally consistent map quickly. In this paper, a\nnovel representation named, HiTMap, is proposed to enhance the existing map\nrepresentations. The central idea is to adopt a submap-based hierarchical\ntopology rather than a global metric map so that only a local metric map is\nmaintained for obstacle avoidance which ensures the lightweight of the\nrepresentation. To guide the robots navigate into unknown spaces, frontiers are\ndetected and attached to the map as an attribute. We also develop a path\nplanning module to evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of our map\nrepresentation. The system is validated in a simulation environment and a\ndemonstration in the real world is conducted. In addition, the HiTMap is made\navailable open-source.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a new end-to-end semi-supervised framework to learn a\ndense keypoint detector using unlabeled multiview images. A key challenge lies\nin finding the exact correspondences between the dense keypoints in multiple\nviews since the inverse of keypoint mapping can be neither analytically derived\nnor differentiated. This limits applying existing multiview supervision\napproaches on sparse keypoint detection that rely on the exact correspondences.\nTo address this challenge, we derive a new probabilistic epipolar constraint\nthat encodes the two desired properties. (1) Soft correspondence: we define a\nmatchability, which measures a likelihood of a point matching to the other\nimage's corresponding point, thus relaxing the exact correspondences'\nrequirement. (2) Geometric consistency: every point in the continuous\ncorrespondence fields must satisfy the multiview consistency collectively. We\nformulate a probabilistic epipolar constraint using a weighted average of\nepipolar errors through the matchability thereby generalizing the\npoint-to-point geometric error to the field-to-field geometric error. This\ngeneralization facilitates learning a geometrically coherent dense keypoint\ndetection model by utilizing a large number of unlabeled multiview images.\nAdditionally, to prevent degenerative cases, we employ a distillation-based\nregularization by using a pretrained model. Finally, we design a new neural\nnetwork architecture, made of twin networks, that effectively minimizes the\nprobabilistic epipolar errors of all possible correspondences between two view\nimages by building affinity matrices. Our method shows superior performance\ncompared to existing methods, including non-differentiable bootstrapping in\nterms of keypoint accuracy, multiview consistency, and 3D reconstruction\naccuracy.",

    "abstract": "Prior to the introduction of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), modeling and\nanalyzing irregular data, particularly graphs, was thought to be the Achilles'\nheel of deep learning. The core concept of GNNs is to find a representation by\nrecursively aggregating the representations of a central node and those of its\nneighbors. The core concept of GNNs is to find a representation by recursively\naggregating the representations of a central node and those of its neighbor,\nand its success has been demonstrated by many GNNs' designs. However, most of\nthem only focus on using the first-order information between a node and its\nneighbors. In this paper, we introduce a central node permutation variant\nfunction through a frustratingly simple and innocent-looking modification to\nthe core operation of a GNN, namely the Feature cOrrelation aGgregation (FOG)\nmodule which learns the second-order information from feature correlation\nbetween a node and its neighbors in the pipeline. By adding FOG into existing\nvariants of GNNs, we empirically verify this second-order information\ncomplements the features generated by original GNNs across a broad set of\nbenchmarks. A tangible boost in performance of the model is observed where the\nmodel surpasses previous state-of-the-art results by a significant margin while\nemploying fewer parameters.

    "abstract": "Face recognition has been greatly facilitated by the development of deep\nneural networks (DNNs) and has been widely applied to many safety-critical\napplications. However, recent studies have shown that DNNs are very vulnerable\nto adversarial examples, raising serious concerns on the security of real-world\nface recognition. In this work, we study sticker-based physical attacks on face\nrecognition for better understanding its adversarial robustness. To this end,\nwe first analyze in-depth the complicated physical-world conditions confronted\nby attacking face recognition, including the different variations of stickers,\nfaces, and environmental conditions. Then, we propose a novel robust physical\nattack framework, dubbed PadvFace, to model these challenging variations\nspecifically. Furthermore, considering the difference in attack complexity, we\npropose an efficient Curriculum Adversarial Attack (CAA) algorithm that\ngradually adapts adversarial stickers to environmental variations from easy to\ncomplex. Finally, we construct a standardized testing protocol to facilitate\nthe fair evaluation of physical attacks on face recognition, and extensive\nexperiments on both dodging and impersonation attacks demonstrate the superior\nperformance of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "Recent research suggests that not all fact checking efforts are equal: when\nand what is fact checked plays a pivotal role in effectively correcting\nmisconceptions. In this paper, we propose a framework to study fact checking\nefforts using Google Trends, a signal that captures search interest over topics\non the world's largest search engine. Our framework consists of extracting\nclaims from fact checking efforts, linking such claims with knowledge graph\nentities, and estimating the online attention they receive. We use this\nframework to study a dataset of 879 COVID-19-related fact checks done in 2020\nby 81 international organizations. Our findings suggest that there is often a\ndisconnect between online attention and fact checking efforts. For example, in\naround 40% of countries where 10 or more claims were fact checked, half or more\nthan half of the top 10 most popular claims were not fact checked. Our analysis\nalso shows that claims are first fact checked after receiving, on average, 35%\nof the total online attention they would eventually receive in 2020. Yet, there\nis a big variation among claims: some were fact checked before receiving a\nsurge of misinformation-induced online attention, others are fact checked much\nlater. Overall, our work suggests that the incorporation of online attention\nsignals may help organizations better assess and prioritize their fact checking\nefforts. Also, in the context of international collaboration, where claims are\nfact checked multiple times across different countries, online attention could\nhelp organizations keep track of which claims are \"migrating\" between different\ncountries.",

The main goal is to gradually explore an\narea while planning paths and calculating information gain in short computation\ntime, suitable for implementation on an on-board computer. To this end, we\npresent a planner that randomly samples viewpoints in the environment map. It\nrelies on a novel and efficient gain calculation based on the Recursive\nShadowcasting algorithm. To determine the Next-Best-View (NBV), our planner\nuses a cuboid-based evaluation method that results in an enviably short\ncomputation time. To reduce the overall exploration time, we also use a dead\nend resolving strategy that allows us to quickly recover from dead ends in a\nchallenging environment.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a distributed attack detection and mitigation technique\nbased on distributed estimation over a multi-agent network, where the agents\ntake partial system measurements susceptible to (possible) biasing attacks. In\nparticular, we assume that the system is not locally observable via the\nmeasurements in the direct neighborhood of any agent. First, for performance\nanalysis in the attack-free case, we show that the proposed distributed\nestimation is unbiased with bounded mean-square deviation in steady-state.\nThen, we propose a residual-based strategy to locally detect possible attacks\nat agents. In contrast to the deterministic thresholds in the literature\nassuming an upper bound on the noise support, we define the thresholds on the\nresiduals in a probabilistic sense. After detecting and isolating the attacked\nagent, a system-digraph-based mitigation strategy is proposed to replace the\nattacked measurement with a new observationally-equivalent one to recover\npotential observability loss. We adopt a graph-theoretic method to classify the\nagents based on their measurements, to distinguish between the agents\nrecovering the system rank-deficiency and the ones recovering\noutput-connectivity of the system digraph. The attack detection/mitigation\nstrategy is specifically described for each type, which is of polynomial-order\ncomplexity for large-scale applications.

In such an architecture, each ADC uses arbitrary\nquantization resolution to save power and hardware cost. Along this direction,\nwe first introduce a quantization-aware channel estimator based on additive\nquantization noise model (AQNM) and linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE)\nestimate theory. Afterwards, by leveraging on the estimated channel state\ninformation (CSI), we derive the asymptotic expressions of achievable uplink\nspectral efficiency (SE) over spatially correlated Rayleigh fading channels for\nmaximal ratio combining (MRC), quantization-aware multicell minimum\nmean-squared error (QA-M-MMSE) combining, and quantization-aware single-cell\nMMSE (QA-S-MMSE) combining, respectively. During the derivations, we consider\nthe effect of quantization errors and resort to random matrix theory to achieve\nthe asymptotic results. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that our\ntheoretical analyses are correct and that the proposed quantization-aware\nestimator and combiners are more beneficial than the quantization-unaware\ncounterparts. Besides, based on a generic power consumption model, it is shown\nthat low-resolution ADCs can obtain the best tradeoff between SE and energy\nefficiency (EE) under multicell scenarios.",

However,\nexisting methods perform upsampling on a single patch, ignoring the coherence\nand relation of the entire surface, thus limiting the upsampled capability.\nAlso, they mainly focus on a clean input, thus the performance is severely\ncompromised when handling scenarios with extra noises. In this paper, we\npresent a novel method for more effective point cloud upsampling, achieving a\nmore robust and improved performance. To this end, we incorporate two thorough\nconsiderations. i) Instead of upsampling each small patch independently as\nprevious works, we take adjacent patches as input and introduce a Patch\nCorrelation Unit to explore the shape correspondence between them for effective\nupsampling. ii)We propose a Position Correction Unit to mitigate the effects of\noutliers and noisy points.

    "abstract": "A physics-informed neural network (PINN) uses physics-augmented loss\nfunctions, e.g., incorporating the residual term from governing differential\nequations, to ensure its output is consistent with fundamental physics laws.\nHowever, it turns out to be difficult to train an accurate PINN model for many\nproblems in practice. In this paper, we address this issue through a novel\nperspective on the merits of learning in sinusoidal spaces with PINNs. By\nanalyzing asymptotic behavior at model initialization, we first prove that a\nPINN of increasing size (i.e., width and depth) induces a bias towards flat\noutputs. Notably, a flat function is a trivial solution to many physics\ndifferential equations, hence, deceptively minimizing the residual term of the\naugmented loss while being far from the true solution. We then show that the\nsinusoidal mapping of inputs, in an architecture we label as sf-PINN, is able\nto elevate output variability, thus avoiding being trapped in the deceptive\nlocal minimum. In addition, the level of variability can be effectively\nmodulated to match high-frequency patterns in the problem at hand. A key facet\nof this paper is the comprehensive empirical study that demonstrates the\nefficacy of learning in sinusoidal spaces with PINNs for a wide range of\nforward and inverse modelling problems spanning multiple physics domains.",

AsRL methods unsuccessfully scale to large\naction spaces, we dynamically truncate the vocabulary spaceusing a generic\nlanguage model. TrufLL thus enables to train a language agent by solely\ninteracting withits environment without any task-specific prior knowledge; it\nis only guided with a task-agnostic languagemodel. Interestingly, this approach\navoids the dependency to labelled datasets and inherently reduces pre-trained\npolicy flaws such as language or exposure biases.

    "abstract": "We present a highly reactive controller which enables bipedal robots to\nblindly walk over various kinds of uneven terrains while resisting pushes. The\nhigh level motion planner does fast online optimization for footstep locations\nand Center of Mass (CoM) height using the decoupled actuated Spring Loaded\nInverted Pendulum (aSLIP) model. The decoupled aSLIP model simplifies the\noriginal aSLIP with Linear Inverted Pendulum (LIP) dynamics in horizontal\nstates and spring dynamics in the vertical state. The motion planning can be\nformulated as a discrete-time Model Predictive Control (MPC) and solved at a\nfrequency of 1k~HZ. The output of the motion planner using a reduced-order\nmodel is fed into an inverse-dynamics based whole body controller for execution\non the robot. A key result of this controller is that the foot of the robot is\ncompliant, which further extends the robot's ability to be robust to unobserved\nterrain changes. We evaluate our method in simulation with the bipedal robot\nSLIDER. Results show the robot can blindly walk over various uneven terrains\nincluding slopes, wave fields and stairs.

    "abstract": "Despite impressive state-of-the-art performance on a wide variety of machine\nlearning tasks in multiple applications, deep learning methods can produce\nover-confident predictions, particularly with limited training data. Therefore,\nquantifying uncertainty is particularly important in critical applications such\nas anomaly or lesion detection and clinical diagnosis, where a realistic\nassessment of uncertainty is essential in determining surgical margins, disease\nstatus and appropriate treatment. In this work, we focus on using quantile\nregression to estimate aleatoric uncertainty and use it for estimating\nuncertainty in both supervised and unsupervised lesion detection problems. In\nthe unsupervised settings, we apply quantile regression to a lesion detection\ntask using Variational AutoEncoder (VAE). The VAE models the output as a\nconditionally independent Gaussian characterized by means and variances for\neach output dimension. Unfortunately, joint optimization of both mean and\nvariance in the VAE leads to the well-known problem of shrinkage or\nunderestimation of variance. We describe an alternative VAE model,\nQuantile-Regression VAE (QR-VAE), that avoids this variance shrinkage problem\nby estimating conditional quantiles for the given input image. Using the\nestimated quantiles, we compute the conditional mean and variance for input\nimages under the conditionally Gaussian model. We then compute reconstruction\nprobability using this model as a principled approach to outlier or anomaly\ndetection applications. In the supervised setting, we develop binary quantile\nregression (BQR) for the supervised lesion segmentation task. BQR segmentation\ncan capture uncertainty in label boundaries. We show how quantile regression\ncan be used to characterize expert disagreement in the location of lesion\nboundaries.",

Building on previous work of ours, we run a\nseries of microtasks experiments to evaluate a large corpus of references,\nsampled from Wikidata triples with labels in several languages. We use a\nconsolidated, curated version of the crowdsourced assessments to train several\nmachine learning models to scale up the analysis to the whole of Wikidata. The\nfindings help us ascertain the quality of references in Wikidata, and identify\ncommon challenges in defining and capturing the quality of user-generated\nmultilingual structured data on the web. We also discuss ongoing editorial\npractices, which could encourage the use of higher-quality references in a more\nimmediate way. All data and code used in the study are available on GitHub for\nfeedback and further improvement and deployment by the research community.",

    "abstract": "High-quality training data play a key role in image segmentation tasks.\nUsually, pixel-level annotations are expensive, laborious and time-consuming\nfor the large volume of training data. To reduce labelling cost and improve\nsegmentation quality, interactive segmentation methods have been proposed,\nwhich provide the result with just a few clicks. However, their performance\ndoes not meet the requirements of practical segmentation tasks in terms of\nspeed and accuracy.

    "abstract": "Industrial control systems present numerous challenges from the communication\nsystems perspective: clock synchronization, deterministic behavior, low\nlatency, high reliability, flexibility, and scalability. These challenges are\nmostly solved with standard technologies over Ethernet, e.g., Time-Sensitive\nNetworking (TSN). As a research trend, it is expected that TSN will converge\nwith wireless, leading to the Wireless TSN paradigm. Also, Wireless TSN is\nexpected to be integrated with Ethernet TSN to create large-scale\nwired-wireless (Hybrid) TSN networks. The first step towards Hybrid TSN is the\ndistribution of the clock reference from the wired to the wireless domain. In\nthis paper, we leverage existing Ethernet TSN and wireless technologies\nimplementations (Wi-Fi and w-SHARP) and we present two hardware architectures\nspecifically engineered to enable the clock synchronization distribution among\nthe network domains. The hardware architectures have been implemented over a\nSystem-on-Chip (SoC) Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform. We\ndemonstrate through several experiments that the implementation is able to\nfulfill the synchronization performance required by TSN.",

    "abstract": "To ensure safety in automated driving, the correct perception of the\nsituation inside the car is as important as its environment. Thus, seat\noccupancy detection and classification of detected instances play an important\nrole in interior sensing. By the knowledge of the seat occupancy status, it is\npossible to, e.g., automate the airbag deployment control. Furthermore, the\npresence of a driver, which is necessary for partially automated driving cars\nat the automation levels two to four can be verified. In this work, we compare\ndifferent statistical methods from the field of image segmentation to approach\nthe problem of background-foreground segmentation in camera based interior\nsensing. In the recent years, several methods based on different techniques\nhave been developed and applied to images or videos from different\napplications. The peculiarity of the given scenarios of interior sensing is,\nthat the foreground instances and the background both contain static as well as\ndynamic elements. In data considered in this work, even the camera position is\nnot completely fixed. We review and benchmark three different methods ranging,\ni.e., Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Morphological Snakes and a deep neural\nnetwork, namely a Mask R-CNN. In particular, the limitations of the classical\nmethods, GMM and Morphological Snakes, for interior sensing are shown.\nFurthermore, it turns, that it is possible to overcome these limitations by\ndeep learning, e.g.\\ using a Mask R-CNN. Although only a small amount of ground\ntruth data was available for training, we enabled the Mask R-CNN to produce\nhigh quality background-foreground masks via transfer learning.

On the other hand, the need for highly\nscalable execution of stateless tasks for cloud systems is driving the\ndefinition of new technologies based on serverless computing.

The recent state-of-the-art face\nrecognition solutions proposed to incorporate a fixed penalty margin on\ncommonly used classification loss function, softmax loss, in the normalized\nhypersphere to increase the discriminative power of face recognition models, by\nminimizing the intra-class variation and maximizing the inter-class variation.\nMarginal softmax losses, such as ArcFace and CosFace, assume that the geodesic\ndistance between and within the different identities can be equally learned\nusing a fixed margin. However, such a learning objective is not realistic for\nreal data with inconsistent inter-and intra-class variation, which might limit\nthe discriminative and generalizability of the face recognition model. In this\npaper, we relax the fixed margin constrain by proposing elastic margin loss\n(ElasticFace) that allows flexibility in the push for class separability. The\nmain idea is to utilize random margin values drawn from a normal distribution\nin each training iteration. This aims at giving the margin chances to extract\nand retract to allow space for flexible class separability learning. We\ndemonstrate the superiority of our elastic margin loss over ArcFace and CosFace\nlosses, using the same geometric transformation, on a large set of mainstream\nbenchmarks.

Existing explainers work by finding global/local subgraphs to\nexplain a prediction, but they are applied after a GNN has already been\ntrained. Here, we propose a meta-learning framework for improving the level of\nexplainability of a GNN directly at training time, by steering the optimization\nprocedure towards what we call `interpretable minima'. Our framework (called\nMATE, MetA-Train to Explain) jointly trains a model to solve the original task,\ne.g., node classification, and to provide easily processable outputs for\ndownstream algorithms that explain the model's decisions in a human-friendly\nway. In particular, we meta-train the model's parameters to quickly minimize\nthe error of an instance-level GNNExplainer trained on-the-fly on randomly\nsampled nodes. The final internal representation relies upon a set of features\nthat can be `better' understood by an explanation algorithm, e.g., another\ninstance of GNNExplainer. Our model-agnostic approach can improve the\nexplanations produced for different GNN architectures and use any\ninstance-based explainer to drive this process. Experiments on synthetic and\nreal-world datasets for node and graph classification show that we can produce\nmodels that are consistently easier to explain by different algorithms.\nFurthermore, this increase in explainability comes at no cost for the accuracy\nof the model.",

    "abstract": "Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have become a popular choice for\nsolving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) due to their\nexcellent approximation power and generalization ability. Recently, Extended\nPINNs (XPINNs) based on domain decomposition methods have attracted\nconsiderable attention due to their effectiveness in modeling multiscale and\nmultiphysics problems and their parallelization. However, theoretical\nunderstanding on their convergence and generalization properties remains\nunexplored. In this study, we take an initial step towards understanding how\nand when XPINNs outperform PINNs. Specifically, for general multi-layer PINNs\nand XPINNs, we first provide a prior generalization bound via the complexity of\nthe target functions in the PDE problem, and a posterior generalization bound\nvia the posterior matrix norms of the networks after optimization. Moreover,\nbased on our bounds, we analyze the conditions under which XPINNs improve\ngeneralization. Concretely, our theory shows that the key building block of\nXPINN, namely the domain decomposition, introduces a tradeoff for\ngeneralization. On the one hand, XPINNs decompose the complex PDE solution into\nseveral simple parts, which decreases the complexity needed to learn each part\nand boosts generalization. On the other hand, decomposition leads to less\ntraining data being available in each subdomain, and hence such model is\ntypically prone to overfitting and may become less generalizable. Empirically,\nwe choose five PDEs to show when XPINNs perform better than, similar to, or\nworse than PINNs, hence demonstrating and justifying our new theory.",

    "title": "Algorithmic Fairness Verification with Graphical Models",
    "abstract": "In recent years, machine learning (ML) algorithms have been deployed in\nsafety-critical and high-stake decision-making, where the fairness of\nalgorithms is of paramount importance. Fairness in ML centers on detecting bias\ntowards certain demographic populations induced by an ML classifier and\nproposes algorithmic solutions to mitigate the bias with respect to different\nfairness definitions. To this end, several fairness verifiers have been\nproposed that compute the bias in the prediction of an ML classifier --\nessentially beyond a finite dataset -- given the probability distribution of\ninput features. In the context of verifying linear classifiers, existing\nfairness verifiers are limited by accuracy due to imprecise modelling of\ncorrelations among features and scalability due to restrictive formulations of\nthe classifiers as SSAT or SMT formulas or by sampling. In this paper, we\npropose an efficient fairness verifier, called FVGM, that encodes the\ncorrelations among features as a Bayesian network. In contrast to existing\nverifiers, FVGM proposes a stochastic subset-sum based approach for verifying\nlinear classifiers. Experimentally, we show that FVGM leads to an accurate and\nscalable assessment for more diverse families of fairness-enhancing algorithms,\nfairness attacks, and group/causal fairness metrics than the state-of-the-art.\nWe also demonstrate that FVGM facilitates the computation of fairness influence\nfunctions as a stepping stone to detect the source of bias induced by subsets\nof features.",

    "abstract": "Once you have invented digital money, you may need a ledger to track who owns\nwhat -- and an interface to that ledger so that users of your money can\ntransact. On the Tezos blockchain this implies: a smart contract (distributed\nprogram), storing in its state a ledger to map owner addresses to token\nquantities, and standardised entrypoints to transact on accounts.\nA bank does a similar job -- it maps account numbers to account quantities\nand permits users to transact -- but in return the bank demands trust, it\nincurs expense to maintain a centralised server and staff, it uses a\nproprietary interface ... and it may speculate using your money and/or display\nrent-seeking behaviour. A blockchain ledger is by design decentralised,\ninexpensive, open, and it won't just bet your tokens on risky derivatives\n(unless you ask).\nThe FA1.2 standard is an open standard for ledger-keeping smart contracts on\nthe Tezos blockchain. Several FA1.2 implementations already exist.\nOr do they? Is the standard sensible and complete? Are the implementations\ncorrect? And what are they implementations \\emph{of}? The FA1.2 standard is\nwritten in English, a specification language favoured by wet human brains but\nnotorious for its incompleteness and ambiguity when rendered into dry and\nunforgiving code.\nIn this paper we report on a formalisation of the FA1.2 standard as a Coq\nspecification, and on a formal verification of three FA1.2-compliant smart\ncontracts with respect to that specification. Errors were found and ambiguities\nwere resolved; but also, there now exists a \\emph{mathematically precise} and\nbattle-tested specification of the FA1.2 ledger standard.\nWe will describe FA1.2 itself, outline the structure of the Coq theories --\nwhich in itself captures some non-trivial and novel design decisions of the\ndevelopment -- and review the detailed verification of the implementations.",

    "abstract": "Due to the advancing development of quantum computers, practical attacks on\nconventional public-key cryptography may become feasible in the next few\ndecades. To address this risk, post-quantum schemes that are secure against\nquantum attacks are being developed.\nLattice-based algorithms are promising replacements for conventional schemes,\nwith BLISS being one of the earliest post-quantum signature schemes in this\nfamily. However, required subroutines such as Gaussian sampling have been\ndemonstrated to be a risk for the security of BLISS, since implementing\nGaussian sampling both efficient and secure with respect to physical attacks is\nhighly challenging.\nThis paper presents three related power side-channel attacks on GALACTICS,\nthe latest constant-time implementation of BLISS. All attacks are based on\nleakages we identified in the Gaussian sampling and signing algorithm of\nGALACTICS.\nTo run the attack, a profiling phase on a device identical to the device\nunder attack is required to train machine learning classifiers.\nIn the attack phase, the leakages of GALACTICS enable the trained classifiers\nto predict sensitive internal information with high accuracy, paving the road\nfor three different key recovery attacks.\nWe demonstrate the leakages by running GALACTICS on a Cortex-M4 and provide\nproof-of-concept data and implementation for all our attacks.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of finding efficient sampling policies in an edge-based\nfeedback system, where sensor samples are offloaded to a back-end server that\nprocesses them and generates feedback to a user. Sampling the system at maximum\nfrequency results in the detection of events of interest with minimum delay but\nincurs higher energy costs due to the communication and processing of redundant\nsamples. On the other hand, lower sampling frequency results in higher delay in\ndetecting the event, thus increasing the idle energy usage and degrading the\nquality of experience. We quantify this trade-off as a weighted function\nbetween the number of samples and the sampling interval. We solve the\nminimisation problem for exponential and Rayleigh distributions, for the random\ntime to the event of interest. We prove the convexity of the objective\nfunctions by using novel techniques, which can be of independent interest\nelsewhere. We argue that adding an initial offset to the periodic sampling can\nfurther reduce the energy consumption and jointly compute the optimum offset\nand sampling interval.

    "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) has become a prominent area in\nnatural language processing due to the emergence of large-scale Knowledge\nGraphs (KGs). Recently Neural Machine Translation based approaches are gaining\nmomentum that translates natural language queries to structured query languages\nthereby solving the KGQA task. However, most of these methods struggle with\nout-of-vocabulary words where test entities and relations are not seen during\ntraining time. In this work, we propose a modular two-stage neural architecture\nto solve the KGQA task.\nThe first stage generates a sketch of the target SPARQL called SPARQL\nsilhouette for the input question. This comprises of (1) Noise simulator to\nfacilitate out-of-vocabulary words and to reduce vocabulary size (2) seq2seq\nmodel for text to SPARQL silhouette generation. The second stage is a Neural\nGraph Search Module. SPARQL silhouette generated in the first stage is\ndistilled in the second stage by substituting precise relation in the predicted\nstructure. We simulate ideal and realistic scenarios by designing a noise\nsimulator. Experimental results show that the quality of generated SPARQL\nsilhouette in the first stage is outstanding for the ideal scenarios but for\nrealistic scenarios (i.e. noisy linker), the quality of the resulting SPARQL\nsilhouette drops drastically. However, our neural graph search module recovers\nit considerably. We show that our method can achieve reasonable performance\nimproving the state-of-art by a margin of 3.72% F1 for the LC-QuAD-1 dataset.\nWe believe, our proposed approach is novel and will lead to dynamic KGQA\nsolutions that are suited for practical applications.",

Consequently, most WSIS approaches exploit off-the-shelf proposal\ntechnique that requires pre-training with high-level labels, deviating a fully\nimage-level supervised setting. Moreover, we focus on semantic drift problem,\n$i.e.,$ missing instances in pseudo instance labels are categorized as\nbackground class, occurring confusion between background and instance in\ntraining. To this end, we propose a novel approach that consists of two\ninnovative components. First, we design a semantic knowledge transfer to obtain\npseudo instance labels by transferring the knowledge of WSSS to WSIS while\neliminating the need for off-the-shelf proposals. Second, we propose a\nself-refinement method that refines the pseudo instance labels in a\nself-supervised scheme and employs them to the training in an online manner\nwhile resolving the semantic drift problem. The extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and we outperform existing works\non PASCAL VOC2012 without any off-the-shelf proposal techniques.

Experiments\nwere conducted to examine the performance of iECA* against state-of-the-art\nalgorithms using performance and validation measures (validation measures,\nstatistical benchmarking, and performance ranking framework). The results\ndemonstrate three primary findings. First, iECA* was more effective than other\nalgorithms in grouping the chosen medical disease datasets according to the\ncluster validation criteria. Second, iECA* exhibited the lower execution time\nand memory consumption for clustering all the datasets, compared to the current\nclustering methods analysed. Third, an operational framework was proposed to\nrate the effectiveness of iECA* against other algorithms in the datasets\nanalysed, and the results indicated that iECA* exhibited the best performance\nin clustering all medical datasets. Further research is required on real-world\nmulti-dimensional data containing complex knowledge fields for experimental\nverification of iECA* compared to evolutionary algorithms.",

We develop a layered networked spread model for\na susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) pathogen-borne disease spreading over\na human contact network and an infrastructure network, and refer to it as a\nlayered networked susceptible-infected-water-susceptible (SIWS) model. The SIWS\nnetwork is in the healthy state (also referred to as the disease-free\nequilibrium) if none of the individuals in the population are infected nor is\nthe infrastructure network contaminated; otherwise, we say that the network is\nin the endemic state (also referred to as the endemic equilibrium). First, we\nestablish sufficient conditions for local exponential stability and global\nasymptotic stability (GAS) of the healthy state. Second, we provide sufficient\nconditions for existence, uniqueness, and GAS of the endemic state. Building\noff of these results, we provide a necessary, and sufficient, condition for the\nhealthy state to be the unique equilibrium of our model. Third, we show that\nthe endemic equilibrium of the SIWS model is worse than that of the networked\nSIS model without any infrastructure network, in the sense that at least one\nsubpopulation has strictly larger infection proportion at the endemic\nequilibrium in the former model than that in the latter. Fourth, we study an\nobservability problem, and, assuming that the measurements of the\nsickness-levels of the human contact network are available, provide a necessary\nand sufficient condition for estimation of the pathogen levels in the\ninfrastructure network. Furthermore, we provide another sufficient, but not\nnecessary, condition for estimation of pathogen levels in the infrastructure\nnetwork.",

    "abstract": "Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are computationally and memory\nintensive. In CNNs, intensive multiplication can have resource implications\nthat may challenge the ability for effective deployment of inference on\nresource-constrained edge devices. This paper proposes GhostShiftAddNet, where\nthe motivation is to implement a hardware-efficient deep network: a\nmultiplication-free CNN with fewer redundant features. We introduce a new\nbottleneck block, GhostSA, that converts all multiplications in the block to\ncheap operations. The bottleneck uses an appropriate number of bit-shift\nfilters to process intrinsic feature maps, then applies a series of\ntransformations that consist of bit-wise shifts with addition operations to\ngenerate more feature maps that fully learn to capture information underlying\nintrinsic features. We schedule the number of bit-shift and addition operations\nfor different hardware platforms. We conduct extensive experiments and ablation\nstudies with desktop and embedded (Jetson Nano) devices for implementation and\nmeasurements. We demonstrate the proposed GhostSA block can replace bottleneck\nblocks in the backbone of state-of-the-art networks architectures and gives\nimproved performance on image classification benchmarks. Further, our\nGhostShiftAddNet can achieve higher classification accuracy with fewer FLOPs\nand parameters (reduced by up to 3x) than GhostNet. When compared to GhostNet,\ninference latency on the Jetson Nano is improved by 1.3x and 2x on the GPU and\nCPU respectively.",

Two\nmain fruitful research fields are discussed here which were strategically\nchosen in order to address current cross disciplinary research priorities\nattracting the interest of geodetic community. The first problem is related to\nionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC) modeling which is an important issue\nin many real time Global Navigation System Satellites (GNSS) applications.\nReliable and fast knowledge about ionospheric variations becomes increasingly\nimportant. GNSS users of single frequency receivers and satellite navigation\nsystems need accurate corrections to remove signal degradation effects caused\nby the ionosphere. Ionospheric modeling using signal processing techniques is\nthe subject of discussion in the present contribution. The next problem under\ndiscussion is energy disaggregation which is an important issue for energy\nefficiency and energy consumption awareness. Reliable and fast knowledge about\nresidential energy consumption at appliance level becomes increasingly\nimportant nowadays and it is an important mitigation measure to prevent energy\nwastage. Energy disaggregation or Nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM) is a\nsingle channel blind source separation problem where the task is to estimate\nthe consumption of each electrical appliance given the total energy\nconsumption. For both problems various deep learning models (DL) are proposed\nthat cover various aspects of the problem under study, whereas experimental\nresults indicate the proposed methods superiority compared to the current state\nof the art.",

However, how to realize intelligent frequency,\ntime, and energy resource allocation to support better performances is an\nimportant problem to be solved. In this paper, we study joint spectrum, energy,\nand time resource management for the EH-CR-NOMA IoT systems. Our goal is to\nminimize the number of data packets losses for all secondary sensing users\n(SSU), while satisfying the constraints on the maximum charging battery\ncapacity, maximum transmitting power, maximum buffer capacity, and minimum data\nrate of primary users (PU) and SSUs. Due to the non-convexity of this\noptimization problem and the stochastic nature of the wireless environment, we\npropose a distributed multidimensional resource management algorithm based on\ndeep reinforcement learning (DRL). Considering the continuity of the resources\nto be managed, the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is\nadopted, based on which each agent (SSU) can manage its own multidimensional\nresources without collaboration. In addition, a simplified but practical action\nadjuster (AA) is introduced for improving the training efficiency and battery\nperformance protection. The provided results show that the convergence speed of\nthe proposed algorithm is about 4 times faster than that of DDPG, and the\naverage number of packet losses (ANPL) is about 8 times lower than that of the\ngreedy algorithm.",

However, a prerequisite is to obtain\nfine-grained knowledge of the environment. There is a limit to how many sensors\ncan be installed in the physical world due to non-negligible expenses. In this\npaper, we propose to infer real-time information of any given location in a\ncity based on historical and current observations from the available sensors\n(termed spatiotemporal inference). Our approach decouples the modeling of\nshort-term and long-term patterns, relying on two major components. Firstly,\nunlike previous studies that separated the spatial and temporal relation\nlearning, we introduce a joint spatiotemporal graph attention network that\nlearns the short-term dependencies across both the spatial and temporal\ndimensions. Secondly, we propose an adaptive graph recurrent network with a\ntime skip for capturing long-term patterns. The adaptive adjacency matrices are\nlearned inductively first as the inputs of a recurrent network to learn dynamic\ndependencies.

While neural networks have been extensively explored to\nassist such tasks, they often ignore the interactions or hierarchical relations\nbetween input features, and process them as concatenated mixtures.

Inspired by discretized numerical methods, choices of the\nparameters include physical quantities and mesh topology features.

The method is implemented on different networks,\nwhich are applied to several frontier scientific machine learning tasks,\nincluding the discovery of unmodeled physics, super-resolution of coarse\nfields, and the simulation of unsteady flows with chemical reactions.

Method:\nWe perform experiments and compare the classifier with three state-of-the-art\nmapping functions in eight open-source Java systems with known\nground-truth-mappings. Results: We find that the classifier outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art in all cases and that it provides a useful baseline for\nfurther research in the area of semi-automatic incremental clustering.\nConclusions: We conclude that machine learning is a useful approach that\nperforms better and with less need for parameterization compared to other\napproaches.

    "abstract": "Attack vectors are continuously evolving in order to evade Intrusion\nDetection systems. Internet of Things (IoT) environments, while beneficial for\nthe IT ecosystem, suffer from inherent hardware limitations, which restrict\ntheir ability to implement comprehensive security measures and increase their\nexposure to vulnerability attacks. This paper proposes a novel Network\nIntrusion Prevention System that utilises a SelfOrganizing Incremental Neural\nNetwork along with a Support Vector Machine. Due to its structure, the proposed\nsystem provides a security solution that does not rely on signatures or rules\nand is capable to mitigate known and unknown attacks in real-time with high\naccuracy. Based on our experimental results with the NSL KDD dataset, the\nproposed framework can achieve on-line updated incremental learning, making it\nsuitable for efficient and scalable industrial applications.",

    "abstract": "In visual semantic navigation, the robot navigates to a target object with\negocentric visual observations and the class label of the target is given. It\nis a meaningful task inspiring a surge of relevant research. However, most of\nthe existing models are only effective for single-agent navigation, and a\nsingle agent has low efficiency and poor fault tolerance when completing more\ncomplicated tasks. Multi-agent collaboration can improve the efficiency and has\nstrong application potentials. In this paper, we propose the multi-agent visual\nsemantic navigation, in which multiple agents collaborate with others to find\nmultiple target objects. It is a challenging task that requires agents to learn\nreasonable collaboration strategies to perform efficient exploration under the\nrestrictions of communication bandwidth. We develop a hierarchical decision\nframework based on semantic mapping, scene prior knowledge, and communication\nmechanism to solve this task. The results of testing experiments in unseen\nscenes with both known objects and unknown objects illustrate the higher\naccuracy and efficiency of the proposed model compared with the single-agent\nmodel.",

    "abstract": "Though significant efforts such as removing false claims and promoting\nreliable sources have been increased to combat COVID-19 \"misinfodemic\", it\nremains an unsolved societal challenge if lacking a proper understanding of\nsusceptible online users, i.e., those who are likely to be attracted by,\nbelieve and spread misinformation. This study attempts to answer {\\it who}\nconstitutes the population vulnerable to the online misinformation in the\npandemic, and what are the robust features and short-term behavior signals that\ndistinguish susceptible users from others. Using a 6-month longitudinal user\npanel on Twitter collected from a geopolitically diverse network-stratified\nsamples in the US, we distinguish different types of users, ranging from social\nbots to humans with various level of engagement with COVID-related\nmisinformation. We then identify users' online features and situational\npredictors that correlate with their susceptibility to COVID-19 misinformation.\nThis work brings unique contributions: First, contrary to the prior studies on\nbot influence, our analysis shows that social bots' contribution to\nmisinformation sharing was surprisingly low, and human-like users'\nmisinformation behaviors exhibit heterogeneity and temporal variability. While\nthe sharing of misinformation was highly concentrated, the risk of occasionally\nsharing misinformation for average users remained alarmingly high. Second, our\nfindings highlight the political sensitivity activeness and responsiveness to\nemotionally-charged content among susceptible users. Third, we demonstrate a\nfeasible solution to efficiently predict users' transient susceptibility solely\nbased on their short-term news consumption and exposure from their networks.\nOur work has an implication in designing effective intervention mechanism to\nmitigate the misinformation dissipation.",

The use of the video signal\nrequires extracting visual features, which are then combined with the acoustic\nfeatures to build an AV-ASR system [1]. This is traditionally done with some\nform of 3D convolutional network (e.g. VGG) as widely used in the computer\nvision community. Recently, image transformers [2] have been introduced to\nextract visual features useful for image classification tasks.

We train our systems on a large-scale dataset composed\nof YouTube videos and evaluate performance on the publicly available LRS3-TED\nset, as well as on a large set of YouTube videos. On a lip-reading task, the\ntransformer-based front-end shows superior performance compared to a strong\nconvolutional baseline.

    "abstract": "Emotion recognition plays a vital role in human-machine interactions and\ndaily healthcare. EEG signals have been reported to be informative and reliable\nfor emotion recognition in recent years. However, the inter-subject variability\nof emotion-related EEG signals poses a great challenge for the practical use of\nEEG-based emotion recognition. Inspired by the recent neuroscience studies on\ninter-subject correlation, we proposed a Contrastive Learning method for\nInter-Subject Alignment (CLISA) for reliable cross-subject emotion recognition.\nContrastive learning was employed to minimize the inter-subject differences by\nmaximizing the similarity in EEG signals across subjects when they received the\nsame stimuli in contrast to different ones. Specifically, a convolutional\nneural network with depthwise spatial convolution and temporal convolution\nlayers was applied to learn inter-subject aligned spatiotemporal\nrepresentations from raw EEG signals. Then the aligned representations were\nused to extract differential entropy features for emotion classification. The\nperformance of the proposed method was evaluated on our THU-EP dataset with 80\nsubjects and the publicly available SEED dataset with 15 subjects. Comparable\nor better cross-subject emotion recognition accuracy (i.e., 72.1% and 47.0% for\nbinary and nine-class classification, respectively, on the THU-EP dataset and\n86.3% on the SEED dataset for three-class classification) was achieved as\ncompared to the state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method could be\ngeneralized well to unseen emotional stimuli as well. The CLISA method is\ntherefore expected to considerably increase the practicality of EEG-based\nemotion recognition by operating in a \"plug-and-play\" manner. Furthermore, the\nlearned spatiotemporal representations by CLISA could provide insights into the\nneural mechanisms of human emotion processing.",

In particular, rule-based KBC has led to interpretable rules\nwhile being comparable in performance with graph embeddings. Even within\nrule-based KBC, there exist different approaches that lead to rules of varying\nquality and previous work has not always been precise in highlighting these\ndifferences. Another issue that plagues most rule-based KBC is the\nnon-uniformity of relation paths: some relation sequences occur in very few\npaths while others appear very frequently. In this paper, we show that not all\nrule-based KBC models are the same and propose two distinct approaches that\nlearn in one case: 1) a mixture of relations and the other 2) a mixture of\npaths. When implemented on top of neuro-symbolic AI, which learns rules by\nextending Boolean logic to real-valued logic, the latter model leads to\nsuperior KBC accuracy outperforming state-of-the-art rule-based KBC by 2-10% in\nterms of mean reciprocal rank. Furthermore, to address the non-uniformity of\nrelation paths, we combine rule-based KBC with graph embeddings thus improving\nour results even further and achieving the best of both worlds.",

Among all algorithmic\nattempts to find formulas for power series, the holonomic property remains the\nmost important requirement to be satisfied by the function under consideration.\nThe targeted functions mainly summarize that of meromorphic functions. However,\nexpressions like $\\tan(z)$, $z/(\\exp(z)-1)$, $\\sec(z)$, etc. are not holonomic,\ntherefore their power series are inaccessible by non-pattern matching\nimplementations like the current Maple \\texttt{convert/FormalPowerSeries}. From\nthe mathematical dictionaries, one can observe that most of the known\nclosed-form formulas of non-holonomic power series involve another sequence\nwhose evaluation linearly depends on some finite summations. In the case of\n$\\tan(z)$ and $\\sec(z)$ the corresponding sequences are the Bernoulli and Euler\nnumbers, respectively. Thus providing a symbolic approach that yields explicit\nrepresentations when linear summations for power series coefficients of\nnon-holonomic functions appear, might be seen as a step forward towards the\nrepresentation of non-holonomic power series.\nBy adapting the method of ansatz with undetermined coefficients, we build an\nalgorithm that computes least-order quadratic differential equations with\npolynomial coefficients for a large class of non-holonomic functions. A\ndifferential equation resulting from this procedure is converted into a\nrecurrence equation by applying the Cauchy product formula and rewriting powers\ninto polynomials and derivatives into shifts. Finally, using enough initial\nvalues we are able to give normal form representations to characterize several\nnon-holonomic power series and prove non-trivial identities.

Can interpretable AI decisions help to address ethics in AI?

We\nalso show that the denunciatory power of AI explanations is highly dependent on\nthe context in which the explanation takes place, such as the gender or\neducation level of the person to whom the explication is intended for. AI\nethics tools are therefore sometimes too flexible and self-regulation through\nthe liberal production of explanations do not seem to be enough to address\nethical issues.

    "title": "Parameter Decoupling Strategy for Semi-supervised 3D Left Atrium  Segmentation",
    "abstract": "Consistency training has proven to be an advanced semi-supervised framework\nand achieved promising results in medical image segmentation tasks through\nenforcing an invariance of the predictions over different views of the inputs.\nHowever, with the iterative updating of model parameters, the models would tend\nto reach a coupled state and eventually lose the ability to exploit unlabeled\ndata. To address the issue, we present a novel semi-supervised segmentation\nmodel based on parameter decoupling strategy to encourage consistent\npredictions from diverse views. Specifically, we first adopt a two-branch\nnetwork to simultaneously produce predictions for each image. During the\ntraining process, we decouple the two prediction branch parameters by quadratic\ncosine distance to construct different views in latent space. Based on this,\nthe feature extractor is constrained to encourage the consistency of\nprobability maps generated by classifiers under diversified features. In the\noverall training process, the parameters of feature extractor and classifiers\nare updated alternately by consistency regularization operation and decoupling\noperation to gradually improve the generalization performance of the model. Our\nmethod has achieved a competitive result over the state-of-the-art\nsemi-supervised methods on the Atrial Segmentation Challenge dataset,\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.

    "abstract": "DevOps is an approach based on lean and agile principles in which business,\ndevelopment, operations, and quality teams cooperate to deliver software\ncontinuously aiming at reducing time to market, and receiving constant feedback\nfrom customers. However, implementing DevOps can be a complex and challenging\nmission due it requires significant paradigm shift. Consequently, many failures\nand misconceptions can occur about DevOps adoption by organizations, despite\nits numerous benefits. This work identifies, describes, and compares different\nperspectives related to DevOps adoption in academy and industry. The\nperspectives can be understood as factors or variables that influence or help\nto understand the DevOps journey. We employed a sequential multi-method\nresearch approach, including Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and Case Study.\nAs a result, eight perspectives were found: concepts, models, principles,\npractices, difficulties, challenges, benefits, and strategies. More\nspecifically, the SLR produced 390 items, which can be understood as\noccurrences of a perspective. The conducted case study confirmed 75 items,\ncorroborating the SLR findings, while another 29 items emerged. This global\nview on DevOps adoption may guide beginners, both theorists, and practitioners,\nto make the necessary organizational transformation less painful.",

    "abstract": "Lyric-to-melody generation is an important task in automatic songwriting.\nPrevious lyric-to-melody generation systems usually adopt end-to-end models\nthat directly generate melodies from lyrics, which suffer from several issues:\n1) lack of paired lyric-melody training data; 2) lack of control on generated\nmelodies. In this paper, we develop TeleMelody, a two-stage lyric-to-melody\ngeneration system with music template (e.g., tonality, chord progression,\nrhythm pattern, and cadence) to bridge the gap between lyrics and melodies\n(i.e., the system consists of a lyric-to-template module and a\ntemplate-to-melody module). TeleMelody has two advantages. First, it is data\nefficient. The template-to-melody module is trained in a self-supervised way\n(i.e., the source template is extracted from the target melody) that does not\nneed any lyric-melody paired data. The lyric-to-template module is made up of\nsome rules and a lyric-to-rhythm model, which is trained with paired\nlyric-rhythm data that is easier to obtain than paired lyric-melody data.\nSecond, it is controllable. The design of template ensures that the generated\nmelodies can be controlled by adjusting the musical elements in template. Both\nsubjective and objective experimental evaluations demonstrate that TeleMelody\ngenerates melodies with higher quality, better controllability, and less\nrequirement on paired lyric-melody data than previous generation systems.",

We\ninvestigate two scenarios based on the IR antennas' cooperation ability. First,\nwe assume that the IR receive and transmit antennas can coordinate with each\nother, where the transmitted signal of each transmit antenna can depend on the\nreceived signals of all receive antennas, and we derive an achievable DoF for\nthis model. In our interference alignment scheme, we divide receivers into two\ngroups, called clean and dirty receivers. We design our scheme such that a part\nof the message of clean receivers can be demultiplexed at the IR. Thus, the IR\ncan use these message streams for interference cancelation at the clean\nreceivers. Next, we consider an IR, whose antennas do not have coordination\nwith each other, where the transmitted signal of each transmit antenna only\ndepends on the received signal of its corresponding receive antenna, and we\nderive an achievable DoF for it. We show that the achievable DoF decreases\nconsiderably compared with the coordinated case.

    "abstract": "We investigate causal inference in the asymptotic regime as the number of\nvariables approaches infinity using an information-theoretic framework. We\ndefine structural entropy of a causal model in terms of its description\ncomplexity measured by the logarithmic growth rate, measured in bits, of all\ndirected acyclic graphs (DAGs), parameterized by the edge density d. Structural\nentropy yields non-intuitive predictions. If we randomly sample a DAG from the\nspace of all models, in the range d = (0, 1/8), almost surely the model is a\ntwo-layer DAG! Semantic entropy quantifies the reduction in entropy where edges\nare removed by causal intervention. Semantic causal entropy is defined as the\nf-divergence between the observational distribution and the interventional\ndistribution P', where a subset S of edges are intervened on to determine their\ncausal influence. We compare the decomposability properties of semantic entropy\nfor different choices of f-divergences, including KL-divergence, squared\nHellinger distance, and total variation distance. We apply our framework to\ngeneralize a recently popular bipartite experimental design for studying causal\ninference on large datasets, where interventions are carried out on one set of\nvariables (e.g., power plants, items in an online store), but outcomes are\nmeasured on a disjoint set of variables (residents near power plants, or\nshoppers). We generalize bipartite designs to k-partite designs, and describe\nan optimization framework for finding the optimal k-level DAG architecture for\nany value of d \\in (0, 1/2). As edge density increases, a sequence of phase\ntransitions occur over disjoint intervals of d, with deeper DAG architectures\nemerging for larger values of d. We also give a quantitative bound on the\nnumber of samples needed to reliably test for average causal influence for a\nk-partite design.",

    "title": "Can We Leverage Predictive Uncertainty to Detect Dataset Shift and  Adversarial Examples in Android Malware Detection?",
    "abstract": "The deep learning approach to detecting malicious software (malware) is\npromising but has yet to tackle the problem of dataset shift, namely that the\njoint distribution of examples and their labels associated with the test set is\ndifferent from that of the training set. This problem causes the degradation of\ndeep learning models without users' notice. In order to alleviate the problem,\none approach is to let a classifier not only predict the label on a given\nexample but also present its uncertainty (or confidence) on the predicted\nlabel, whereby a defender can decide whether to use the predicted label or not.\nWhile intuitive and clearly important, the capabilities and limitations of this\napproach have not been well understood. In this paper, we conduct an empirical\nstudy to evaluate the quality of predictive uncertainties of malware detectors.\nSpecifically, we re-design and build 24 Android malware detectors (by\ntransforming four off-the-shelf detectors with six calibration methods) and\nquantify their uncertainties with nine metrics, including three metrics dealing\nwith data imbalance. Our main findings are: (i) predictive uncertainty indeed\nhelps achieve reliable malware detection in the presence of dataset shift, but\ncannot cope with adversarial evasion attacks; (ii) approximate Bayesian methods\nare promising to calibrate and generalize malware detectors to deal with\ndataset shift, but cannot cope with adversarial evasion attacks; (iii)\nadversarial evasion attacks can render calibration methods useless, and it is\nan open problem to quantify the uncertainty associated with the predicted\nlabels of adversarial examples (i.e., it is not effective to use predictive\nuncertainty to detect adversarial examples).",

These\nguiding principles are named FUTURE-AI and its building blocks consist of (i)\nFairness, (ii) Universality, (iii) Traceability, (iv) Usability, (v) Robustness\nand (vi) Explainability.

    "abstract": "The global electric car sales in 2020 continued to exceed the expectations\nclimbing to over 3 millions and reaching a market share of over 4%. However,\nuncertainty of generation caused by higher penetration of renewable energies\nand the advent of Electrical Vehicles (EV) with their additional electricity\ndemand could cause strains to the power system, both at distribution and\ntransmission levels. Demand response aggregation and load control will enable\ngreater grid stability and greater penetration of renewable energies into the\ngrid. The present work fits this context in supporting charging optimization\nfor EV in parking premises assuming a incumbent high penetration of EVs in the\nsystem. We propose a methodology to predict an estimation of the parking\nduration in shared parking premises with the objective of estimating the energy\nrequirement of a specific parking lot, evaluate optimal EVs charging schedule\nand integrate the scheduling into a smart controller. We formalize the\nprediction problem as a supervised machine learning task to predict the\nduration of the parking event before the car leaves the slot. This predicted\nduration feeds the energy management system that will allocate the power over\nthe duration reducing the overall peak electricity demand. We structure our\nexperiments inspired by two research questions aiming to discover the accuracy\nof the proposed machine learning approach and the most relevant features for\nthe prediction models. We experiment different algorithms and features\ncombination for 4 datasets from 2 different campus facilities in Italy and\nBrazil.

Scanning\nFrequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radars can be useful for\nlocalization and mapping in low visibility, but return a lot of noise compared\nto (more commonly used) lidar, which makes the detection task more challenging.\nOur Bounded False-Alarm Rate (BFAR) detector is different from the classical\nConstant False-Alarm Rate (CFAR) detector in that it applies an affine\ntransformation on the estimated noise level after which the parameters that\nminimize the estimation error can be learned. BFAR is an optimized combination\nbetween CFAR and fixed-level thresholding. Only a single parameter needs to be\nlearned from a training dataset. We apply BFAR to the use case of radar\nodometry, and adapt a state-of-the-art odometry pipeline (CFEAR), replacing its\noriginal conservative filtering with BFAR. In this way we reduce the\nstate-of-the-art translation/rotation odometry errors from 1.76%/0.5deg/100 m\nto 1.55%/0.46deg/100 m; an improvement of 12.5%.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the problem of discovering and modeling regime shifts in an\necosystem comprising multiple time series known as co-evolving time series.\nRegime shifts refer to the changing behaviors exhibited by series at different\ntime intervals. Learning these changing behaviors is a key step toward time\nseries forecasting. While advances have been made, existing methods suffer from\none or more of the following shortcomings: (1) failure to take relationships\nbetween time series into consideration for discovering regimes in multiple time\nseries; (2) lack of an effective approach that models time-dependent behaviors\nexhibited by series; (3) difficulties in handling data discontinuities which\nmay be informative. Most of the existing methods are unable to handle all of\nthese three issues in a unified framework. This, therefore, motivates our\neffort to devise a principled approach for modeling interactions and\ntime-dependency in co-evolving time series. Specifically, we model an ecosystem\nof multiple time series by summarizing the heavy ensemble of time series into a\nlighter and more meaningful structure called a \\textit{mapping grid}. By using\nthe mapping grid, our model first learns time series behavioral dependencies\nthrough a dynamic network representation, then learns the regime transition\nmechanism via a full time-dependent Cox regression model.

    "abstract": "Existing calibration methods occasionally fail for large field-of-view\ncameras due to the non-linearity of the underlying problem and the lack of good\ninitial values for all parameters of the used camera model.

A lot of the\ndifficulties of general camera calibration lie in the use of a forward\nprojection model.

Machine Learning has the potential to solve a wider\ndiversity of MFG problems thanks to generalizations capacities. We study how to\nleverage these generalization properties to learn policies enabling a typical\nagent to behave optimally against any population distribution. In reference to\nthe Master equation in MFGs, we coin the term ``Master policies'' to describe\nthem and we prove that a single Master policy provides a Nash equilibrium,\nwhatever the initial distribution. We propose a method to learn such Master\npolicies. Our approach relies on three ingredients: adding the current\npopulation distribution as part of the observation, approximating Master\npolicies with neural networks, and training via Reinforcement Learning and\nFictitious Play. We illustrate on numerical examples not only the efficiency of\nthe learned Master policy but also its generalization capabilities beyond the\ndistributions used for training.",

In this work, a BERTbased neural network model (Devlin et\nal.,2018) is applied to the JIGSAW dataset (Jigsaw/Conversation AI, 2019) in\nor-der to create a model identifying hate-ful and toxic comments (strictly\nseper-ated from offensive language) in onlinesocial platforms (English\nlanguage), inthis case Twitter. Three other neural net-work architectures and a\nGPT-2 (Radfordet al., 2019) model are also applied onthe provided data set in\norder to com-pare these different models. The trainedBERT model is then applied\non two dif-ferent data sets to evaluate its generali-sation power, namely on\nanother Twitterdata set (Tom Davidson, 2017) (Davidsonet al., 2017) and the\ndata set HASOC 2019(Thomas Mandl, 2019) (Mandl et al.,2019) which includes\nTwitter and alsoFacebook comments; we focus on the En-glish HASOC 2019 data.In\naddition,it can be shown that by fine-tuning thetrained BERT model on these two\ndatasets by applying different transfer learn-ing scenarios via retraining\npartial or alllayers the predictive scores improve com-pared to simply applying\nthe model pre-trained on the JIGSAW data set.

Although 2D networks benefit from large-scale 2D supervised\npretraining, it is weak in capturing 3D context. 3D networks are strong in 3D\ncontext yet lack supervised pretraining. As an emerging technique, \\emph{3D\ncontext fusion operator}, which enables conversion from 2D pretrained networks,\nleverages the advantages of both and has achieved great success. Existing 3D\ncontext fusion operators are designed to be spatially symmetric, i.e.,\nperforming identical operations on each 2D slice like convolutions. However,\nthese operators are not truly equivariant to translation, especially when only\na few 3D slices are used as inputs.

An efficient segmentation of brain Magnetic Resonance\nImages (MRIs) is of prime concern to radiologists due to their poor\nillumination and other conditions related to de acquisition of the images.\nThresholding is a popular method for segmentation that uses the histogram of an\nimage to label different homogeneous groups of pixels into different classes.\nHowever, the computational cost increases exponentially according to the number\nof thresholds. In this paper, we perform the multi-level thresholding using an\nevolutionary metaheuristic. It is an improved version of the Harris Hawks\nOptimization (HHO) algorithm that combines the chaotic initialization and the\nconcept of altruism. Further, for fitness assignment, we use a hybrid objective\nfunction where along with the cross-entropy minimization, we apply a new\nentropy function, and leverage weights to the two objective functions to form a\nnew hybrid approach. The HHO was originally designed to solve numerical\noptimization problems. Earlier, the statistical results and comparisons have\ndemonstrated that the HHO provides very promising results compared with\nwell-established metaheuristic techniques. In this article, the altruism has\nbeen incorporated into the HHO algorithm to enhance its exploitation\ncapabilities.

First, we perform a worst-case analysis to\nidentify the limits of deterministic online routing and show that the ratio\nbetween the total travel cost of the online solution of any deterministic\nalgorithm and that of the optimal offline solution is unbounded, even in simple\nsettings. This result motivates us to move beyond worst-case analysis. Here, we\nconsider algorithms that exploit knowledge of past problem instances and show\nhow to design data-driven algorithms whose performance can be quantified and\nformally generalized to unseen future instances. We present numerical\nexperiments based on an application case for the San Francisco Bay Area to\nevaluate the performance of our approach. Our results show that the data-driven\nalgorithms we develop outperform commonly used greedy online-routing\nalgorithms.",

Such a system is conceptually\nsimple as it only takes grapheme or phoneme input, uses Mel-spectrogram as an\nintermediate feature, and directly generates speech samples. The system\nachieves quality equal or close to natural speech. However, the high\ncomputational cost of the system and issues with robustness have limited their\nusage in real-world speech synthesis applications and products. In this paper,\nwe present key modeling improvements and optimization strategies that enable\ndeploying these models, not only on GPU servers, but also on mobile devices.\nThe proposed system can generate high-quality 24 kHz speech at 5x faster than\nreal time on server and 3x faster than real time on mobile devices.",

There is an urgent need to come up with\nefficient anti-cocaine addiction drugs. Unfortunately, no medications have been\napproved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), despite the extensive\neffort in the past few decades. The main challenge is the intricate molecular\nmechanisms of cocaine addiction, involving synergistic interactions among\nproteins upstream and downstream of dopamine transporter (DAT) functions\nimpacted by cocaine. However, traditional in vivo or in vitro experiments can\nnot address the roles of so many proteins, highlighting the need for innovative\nstrategies in the field. We propose a proteome-informed machine learning/deep\nlearning (ML/DL) platform to discover nearly optimal anti-cocaine addiction\nlead compounds. We construct and analyze proteomic protein-protein interaction\n(PPI) networks for cocaine dependence to identify 141 involved drug targets and\nrepresent over 60,000 associated drug candidates or experimental drugs in the\nlatent space using an autoencoder (EA) model trained from over 104 million\nmolecules. We build 32 ML models for cross-target analysis of these drug\ncandidates for side effects and repurposing potential. We further screen the\nabsorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET)\nproperties of these candidates. Our platform reveals that essentially all of\nthe existing drug candidates, including dozens of experimental drugs, fail to\npass our cross-target and ADMET screenings.

HDR images have a higher detail\nand clarity of structure, objects, and color, which the standard images lack.\nHDR images are useful in capturing scenes that pose high brightness, darker\nareas, and shadows, etc. An HDR image comprises multiple narrow-range-exposure\nimages combined into one high-quality image. As these HDR images cannot be\ndisplayed on standard display devices, the real challenge comes while\nconverting these HDR images to Low dynamic range (LDR) images. The conversion\nof HDR image to LDR image is performed using Tone-mapped operators (TMOs). This\nconversion results in the loss of much valuable information in structure,\ncolor, naturalness, and exposures. The loss of information in the LDR image may\nnot directly be visible to the human eye. To calculate how good an LDR image is\nafter conversion, various metrics have been proposed previously. Some are not\nnoise resilient, some work on separate color channels (Red, Green, and Blue one\nby one), and some lack capacity to identify the structure. To deal with this\nproblem, we propose a metric in this paper called the Tone Mapping Quality\nIndex (TMQI-3), which evaluates the quality of the LDR image based on its\nobjective score. TMQI-3 is noise resilient, takes account of structure and\nnaturalness, and works on all three color channels combined into one luminosity\ncomponent.

Rock physics models have long been the focus\nof predicting wave velocity. However, construction of a theoretical model\nrequires careful physical considerations and mathematical derivations, which\nmeans a long research process. In addition, various complicated situations\noften occur in practice, which brings great difficulties to the application of\ntheoretical models. On the other hand, there are many empirical formulas based\non real data. These empirical models are often simple and easy to use, but may\nbe not based on physical principles and lack a proper formulation of physics.\nThis work proposed a rational function neural networks (RafNN) for data-driven\nrock physics modeling. Based on the observation data set, this method can\ndeduce a velocity model which not only satisfies the actual data distribution,\nbut also has a proper mathematical form reflecting the inherent rock physics.\nThe Gassmann's equation, which is the most commonly used theoretical model\nrelating bulk modulus of porous rock to mineral composition, porosity and\nfluid, is perfectly reconstructed by using data-driven RafNN. The advantage of\nthis method is that only observational data sets are required to extract model\nequations, and no complex mathematical and physical processes are involved.\nThis work opens up for the first time a new avenue on constructing analytical\nexpression of velocity models using neural networks and field data, which is of\ngreat interest for exploring the heterogeneous structure of the Earth.",

The estimators we study\nminimize the sum of squared data-fitting errors plus a regularization term\nproportional to the Euclidean norm of the network weights. This minimization\ncorresponds to the common approach of training a neural network with weight\ndecay. We quantify the performance (mean-squared error) of these neural network\nestimators when the data-generating function belongs to the space of functions\nof second-order bounded variation in the Radon domain. This space of functions\nwas recently proposed as the natural function space associated with shallow\nReLU neural networks. We derive a minimax lower bound for the estimation\nproblem for this function space and show that the neural network estimators are\nminimax optimal up to logarithmic factors. We also show that this is a \"mixed\nvariation\" function space that contains classical multivariate function spaces\nincluding certain Sobolev spaces and certain spectral Barron spaces. Finally,\nwe use these results to quantify a gap between neural networks and linear\nmethods (which include kernel methods). This paper sheds light on the\nphenomenon that neural networks seem to break the curse of dimensionality.",

To tackle this challenging domain\ngeneralization problem, we propose a Domain Composition and Attention-based\nnetwork (DCA-Net) to improve the ability of domain representation and\ngeneralization. First, we present a domain composition method that represents\none certain domain by a linear combination of a set of basis representations\n(i.e., a representation bank).

Then, a domain attention module is proposed to learn the\nlinear combination coefficients of the basis representations. The result of\nlinear combination is used to calibrate the feature maps of an input image,\nwhich enables the model to generalize to different and even unseen domains.

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral imaging with high spectral resolution plays an important role\nin finding objects, identifying materials, or detecting processes. The decrease\nof the widths of spectral bands leads to a decrease in the signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) of measurements. The decreased SNR reduces the reliability of\nmeasured features or information extracted from HSIs. Furthermore, the image\ndegradations linked with various mechanisms also result in different types of\nnoise, such as Gaussian noise, impulse noise, deadlines, and stripes. This\npaper introduces a fast and parameter-free hyperspectral image mixed noise\nremoval method (termed FastHyMix), which characterizes the complex distribution\nof mixed noise by using a Gaussian mixture model and exploits two main\ncharacteristics of hyperspectral data, namely low-rankness in the spectral\ndomain and high correlation in the spatial domain. The Gaussian mixture model\nenables us to make a good estimation of Gaussian noise intensity and the\nlocation of sparse noise. The proposed method takes advantage of the\nlow-rankness using subspace representation and the spatial correlation of HSIs\nby adding a powerful deep image prior, which is extracted from a neural\ndenoising network. An exhaustive array of experiments and comparisons with\nstate-of-the-art denoisers were carried out. The experimental results show\nsignificant improvement in both synthetic and real datasets.

Achieving reliable disruption prediction\nfor a device's HP operation based on its low performance (LP) data is key to\nsuccess. In this letter, through explorative data analysis and dedicated\nnumerical experiments on multiple existing tokamaks, we demonstrate how the\noperational regimes of tokamaks can affect the power of a trained disruption\npredictor. First, our results suggest data-driven disruption predictors trained\non abundant LP discharges work poorly on the HP regime of the same tokamak,\nwhich is a consequence of the distinct distributions of the tightly correlated\nsignals related to disruptions in these two regimes. Second, we find that\nmatching operational parameters among tokamaks strongly improves cross-machine\naccuracy which implies our model learns from the underlying scalings of\ndimensionless physics parameters like q_{95}, \\beta_{p} and confirms the\nimportance of these parameters in disruption physics and cross machine domain\nmatching from the data-driven perspective. Finally, our results show how in the\nabsence of HP data from the target devices, the best predictivity of the HP\nregime for the target machine can be achieved by combining LP data from the\ntarget with HP data from other machines. These results provide a possible\ndisruption predictor development strategy for next generation tokamaks, such as\nITER and SPARC, and highlight the importance of developing on existing machines\nbaseline scenario discharges of future tokamaks to collect more relevant\ndisruptive data.",

Particularly, the presented method can effectively\naddress the three problems raised above and is very flexible to use in\npractical disparity analyses. We demonstrate the validity of proposed\nmodel-based approach on both synthetic and real-world speech data.",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on channel estimation in single-user and multi-user MIMO\nsystems with multi-antenna base stations equipped with 1-bit spatial\nsigma-delta analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). A careful selection of the\nquantization voltage level and phase shift used in the feedback loop of 1-bit\nsigma-delta ADCs is critical to improve its effective resolution. We first\ndevelop a quantization noise model for 1-bit spatial sigma-delta ADCs. Using\nthe developed noise model, we then present a two-step channel estimation\nalgorithm to estimate a multipath channel parameterized by the gains, angles of\narrival (AoAs), and angles of departure (AoDs). Specifically, in the first\nstep, the AoAs and path gains are estimated using uplink pilots, which excite\nall the angles uniformly. Next, in the second step, the AoDs are estimated by\nprogressively refining uplink beams through a recursive bisection procedure.\nFor this algorithm, we propose a technique to select the quantization voltage\nlevel and phase shift. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that with\nthe proposed parametric channel estimation algorithm, MIMO systems with 1-bit\nspatial sigma-delta ADCs perform significantly better than those with regular\n1-bit ADCs and are on par with MIMO systems with high-resolution ADCs.",

    "abstract": "Learning super-resolution (SR) network without the paired low resolution (LR)\nand high resolution (HR) image is difficult because direct supervision through\nthe corresponding HR counterpart is unavailable. Recently, many real-world SR\nresearches take advantage of the unpaired image-to-image translation technique.\nThat is, they used two or more generative adversarial networks (GANs), each of\nwhich translates images from one domain to another domain, \\eg, translates\nimages from the HR domain to the LR domain. However, it is not easy to stably\nlearn such a translation with GANs using unpaired data. In this study, we\npresent a simple and efficient method of training of real-world SR network. To\nstably train the network, we use statistics of an image patch, such as means\nand variances. Our real-world SR framework consists of two GANs, one for\ntranslating HR images to LR images (degradation task) and the other for\ntranslating LR to HR (SR task). We argue that the unpaired image translation\nusing GANs can be learned efficiently with our proposed data sampling strategy,\nnamely, variance matching. We test our method on the NTIRE 2020 real-world SR\ndataset.

In this paper, we have explored the properties of network signal and\nnoise and proposed a novel network denoising framework called Network\nRefinement (NR) that adjusts the edge weights by applying a nonlinear graph\noperator based on a diffusion process defined by random walk on the graph.\nSpecifically, this unified framework consists of two closely linked approaches\nnamed NR-F and NR-B, which improve the SNR of noisy input networks from two\ndifferent perspectives: NR-F aims at enhancing signal strength, while NR-B aims\nat weakening noise strength.

    "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD) is a set of neurodevelopmental conditions that\naffect patients' social abilities. In recent years, deep learning methods have\nbeen employed to detect ASD through functional MRI (fMRI). However, existing\napproaches solely concentrated on the abnormal brain functional connections but\nignored the importance of regional activities. Due to this biased prior\nknowledge, previous diagnosis models suffered from inter-site heterogeneity and\ninter-individual phenotypical differences. To address this issue, we propose a\nnovel feature extraction method for fMRI that can learn a personalized\nlowe-resolution representation of the entire brain networking regarding both\nthe functional connections and regional activities. First, we abstract the\nbrain imaging as a graph structure, where nodes represent brain areas and edges\ndenote functional connections, and downsample it to a sparse network by\nhierarchical graph pooling. Subsequently, by assigning each subject with the\nextracted features and building edges through inter-individual non-imaging\ncharacteristics, we build a population graph. The non-identically distributed\nnode features are further recalibrated to node embeddings learned by graph\nconvolutional networks. By these means, our framework can extract features\ndirectly and efficiently from the entire fMRI and be aware of implicit\ninter-individual differences. We have evaluated our framework on the ABIDE-I\ndataset with 10-fold cross-validation.

Common\napproaches such as pooling datasets and applying standard statistical learning\nmethods can result in poor out-of-study prediction performance when datasets\nare heterogeneous. Theoretical and applied work has shown $\\textit{multi-study\nensembling}$ to be a viable alternative that leverages the variability across\ndatasets in a manner that promotes model generalizability. Multi-study\nensembling uses a two-stage $\\textit{stacking}$ strategy which fits\nstudy-specific models and estimates ensemble weights separately. This approach\nignores, however, the ensemble properties at the model-fitting stage,\npotentially resulting in a loss of efficiency. We therefore propose\n$\\textit{optimal ensemble construction}$, an $\\textit{all-in-one}$ approach to\nmulti-study stacking whereby we jointly estimate ensemble weights as well as\nparameters associated with each study-specific model. We prove that limiting\ncases of our approach yield existing methods such as multi-study stacking and\npooling datasets before model fitting. We propose an efficient block coordinate\ndescent algorithm to optimize the proposed loss function. We compare our\napproach to standard methods by applying it to a multi-country COVID-19 dataset\nfor baseline mortality prediction. We show that when little data is available\nfor a country before the onset of the pandemic, leveraging data from other\ncountries can substantially improve prediction accuracy. Importantly, our\napproach outperforms multi-study stacking and other standard methods in this\napplication. We further characterize the method's performance in data-driven\nand other simulations.

The utilisation of integrated photonics in\nneural networks offers a promising alternative approach to microelectronic and\nhybrid optical-electronic implementations due to improvements in computational\nspeed and low energy consumption in machine-learning tasks. However, at\npresent, most of the neural network hardware systems are still electronic-based\ndue to a lack of optical realisation of the nonlinear activation function.\nHere, we experimentally demonstrate two novel approaches for implementing an\nall-optical neural nonlinear activation function based on utilising unique\nlight-matter interactions in 2D Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ (MXene) in the infrared (IR)\nrange in two configurations: 1) a saturable absorber made of MXene thin film,\nand 2) a silicon waveguide with MXene flakes overlayer.

The\nproposed configurations are reconfigurable and can therefore be adjusted for\nvarious applications without the need to modify the physical structure.

In this regard, we use the publicly available electricity market data to\nlearn, characterize, and evaluate different types of convergence bidding\nstrategies that are currently used by market participants. Our analysis\nincludes developing a data-driven reverse engineering method that we apply to\nthree years of real-world data. Our analysis involves feature selection and\ndensity-based data clustering. It results in identifying three main clusters of\nCB strategies in the California ISO market. Different characteristics and the\nperformance of each cluster of strategies are analyzed. Interestingly, we\nunmask a common real-world strategy that does not match any of the existing\nstrategic convergence bidding methods in the literature. Next, we build upon\nthe lessons learned from the existing real-world strategies to propose a new CB\nstrategy that can significantly outperform them. Our analysis includes\ndeveloping a new strategy for convergence bidding. The new strategy has three\nsteps: net profit maximization by capturing price spikes, dynamic node\nlabeling, and strategy selection algorithm.

    "abstract": "Multi-task regression attempts to exploit the task similarity in order to\nachieve knowledge transfer across related tasks for performance improvement.\nThe application of Gaussian process (GP) in this scenario yields the\nnon-parametric yet informative Bayesian multi-task regression paradigm.\nMulti-task GP (MTGP) provides not only the prediction mean but also the\nassociated prediction variance to quantify uncertainty, thus gaining popularity\nin various scenarios. The linear model of coregionalization (LMC) is a\nwell-known MTGP paradigm which exploits the dependency of tasks through linear\ncombination of several independent and diverse GPs. The LMC however suffers\nfrom high model complexity and limited model capability when handling\ncomplicated multi-task cases. To this end, we develop the neural embedding of\ncoregionalization that transforms the latent GPs into a high-dimensional latent\nspace to induce rich yet diverse behaviors. Furthermore, we use advanced\nvariational inference as well as sparse approximation to devise a tight and\ncompact evidence lower bound (ELBO) for higher quality of scalable model\ninference. Extensive numerical experiments have been conducted to verify the\nhigher prediction quality and better generalization of our model, named NSVLMC,\non various real-world multi-task datasets and the cross-fluid modeling of\nunsteady fluidized bed.",

    "abstract": "Lymph node station (LNS) delineation from computed tomography (CT) scans is\nan indispensable step in radiation oncology workflow. High inter-user\nvariabilities across oncologists and prohibitive laboring costs motivated the\nautomated approach. Previous works exploit anatomical priors to infer LNS based\non predefined ad-hoc margins. However, without voxel-level supervision, the\nperformance is severely limited. LNS is highly context-dependent - LNS\nboundaries are constrained by anatomical organs - we formulate it as a deep\nspatial and contextual parsing problem via encoded anatomical organs. This\npermits the deep network to better learn from both CT appearance and organ\ncontext. We develop a stratified referencing organ segmentation protocol that\ndivides the organs into anchor and non-anchor categories and uses the former's\npredictions to guide the later segmentation. We further develop an auto-search\nmodule to identify the key organs that opt for the optimal LNS parsing\nperformance. Extensive four-fold cross-validation experiments on a dataset of\n98 esophageal cancer patients (with the most comprehensive set of 12 LNSs + 22\norgans in thoracic region to date) are conducted. Our LNS parsing model\nproduces significant performance improvements, with an average Dice score of\n81.1% +/- 6.1%, which is 5.0% and 19.2% higher over the pure CT-based deep\nmodel and the previous representative approach, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Compression standards have been used to reduce the cost of image storage and\ntransmission for decades. In recent years, learned image compression methods\nhave been proposed and achieved compelling performance to the traditional\nstandards. However, in these methods, a set of different networks are used for\nvarious compression rates, resulting in a high cost in model storage and\ntraining. Although some variable-rate approaches have been proposed to reduce\nthe cost by using a single network, most of them brought some performance\ndegradation when applying fine rate control. To enable variable-rate control\nwithout sacrificing the performance, we propose an efficient Interpolation\nVariable-Rate (IVR) network, by introducing a handy Interpolation Channel\nAttention (InterpCA) module in the compression network. With the use of two\nhyperparameters for rate control and linear interpolation, the InterpCA\nachieves a fine PSNR interval of 0.001 dB and a fine rate interval of 0.0001\nBits-Per-Pixel (BPP) with 9000 rates in the IVR network. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the IVR network is the first variable-rate learned method that\noutperforms VTM 9.0 (intra) in PSNR and Multiscale Structural Similarity\n(MS-SSIM).",

Despite the wide use of the terminologies of tokens\nand tokenisation in the cryptocurrency community, the underlying concept\nsometimes does not square well with the economic notions, or is even contrary\nto them. The UTXO design of Bitcoin exhibits partially characteristics of a\ntoken-based system and partially characteristics of an account-based system. A\ndiscussion on the difficulty to implement the economic notion of tokens in the\ndigital domain, along with an exposition of the design of UTXO, is given in\norder to discuss why UTXO-based systems should be viewed as account-based\naccording to the classical economic notion. Besides, a detailed comparison\nbetween UTXO-based systems and account-based systems is presented.

    "abstract": "The resolution of the Poisson equation is usually one of the most\ncomputationally intensive steps for incompressible fluid solvers. Lately, Deep\nLearning, and especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), has been\nintroduced to solve this equation, leading to significant inference time\nreduction at the cost of a lack of guarantee on the accuracy of the solution.\nThis drawback might lead to inaccuracies and potentially unstable simulations.\nIt also makes impossible a fair assessment of the CNN speedup, for instance,\nwhen changing the network architecture, since evaluated at different error\nlevels. To circumvent this issue, a hybrid strategy is developed, which couples\na CNN with a traditional iterative solver to ensure a user-defined accuracy\nlevel. The CNN hybrid method is tested on two flow cases, consisting of a\nvariable-density plume with and without obstacles, demostrating remarkable\ngeneralization capabilities, ensuring both the accuracy and stability of the\nsimulations. The error distribution of the predictions using several network\narchitectures is further investigated. Results show that the threshold of the\nhybrid strategy defined as the mean divergence of the velocity field is\nensuring a consistent physical behavior of the CNN-based hybrid computational\nstrategy. This strategy allows a systematic evaluation of the CNN performance\nat the same accuracy level for various network architectures. In particular,\nthe importance of incorporating multiple scales in the network architecture is\ndemonstrated, since improving both the accuracy and the inference performance\ncompared with feedforward CNN architectures, as these networks can provide\nsolutions 1 10-25 faster than traditional iterative solvers.",

Using manual segmentations as a reference, CMR\nslices were assigned to one of four regions: non-cardiac, base, middle, and\napex. Using the nnU-Net framework as a baseline, we investigated two different\napproaches to reduce the segmentation performance gap between cardiac regions:\n(1) non-uniform batch sampling, which allows us to choose how often images from\ndifferent regions are seen during training; and (2) a cardiac-region\nclassification model followed by three (i.e. base, middle, and apex)\nregion-specific segmentation models.

Through an exhaustive study of cross-validated experiments with limited\ntraining data availability, we evaluate both an inter-organ approach utilizing\nalready available data for other tissues, and an intra-organ approach,\nutilizing the primary tumor. Both these approaches result in little to no extra\nannotation effort. Our results show that these data augmentation strategies can\nbe an efficient way of increasing accuracy on metastasis detection, but\nfore-most increase robustness.",

Automatic rib segmentation methods can speed up the process through\nrib measurement and visualization. However, prior arts mostly use in-house\nlabeled datasets that are publicly unavailable and work on dense 3D volumes\nthat are computationally inefficient. To address these issues, we develop a\nlabeled rib segmentation benchmark, named \\emph{RibSeg}, including 490 CT scans\n(11,719 individual ribs) from a public dataset. For ground truth generation, we\nused existing morphology-based algorithms and manually refined its results.\nThen, considering the sparsity of ribs in 3D volumes, we thresholded and\nsampled sparse voxels from the input and designed a point cloud-based baseline\nmethod for rib segmentation.

Since exact algorithms scale exponentially\nwith the state-space dimension, we develop a heuristic solution approach based\non reinforcement learning. We propose an approximate policy iteration algorithm\nin which we apply a linear model to approximate the action-value function of a\npolicy. Policy evaluation is performed by solving the projected Bellman\nequation from a sample of state transitions, decisions and costs obtained by\nsimulation. Due to the large decision space, policy improvement is performed\nvia the cross-entropy method.

Such models often rely on low-dimensional maps\ngenerated by complex processing pipelines.

Monte Carlo Arithmetic, a technique for introducing\ncontrolled amounts of numerical noise, was used to perturb a structural\nconnectome estimation pipeline, ultimately producing a range of plausible\nnetworks for each sample. The variability in the perturbed networks was\ncaptured in an augmented dataset, which was then used for an age classification\ntask. We found that resampling brain networks across a series of such\nnumerically perturbed outcomes led to improved performance in all tested\nclassifiers, preprocessing strategies, and dimensionality reduction techniques.\nImportantly, we find that this benefit does not hinge on a large number of\nperturbations, suggesting that even minimally perturbing a dataset adds\nmeaningful variance which can be captured in the subsequently designed models.",

    "abstract": "In this study, the effects of surface roughness and pore characteristics on\nfatigue lives of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) Ti-6Al-4V parts were\ninvestigated. The 197 fatigue bars were printed using the same laser power but\nwith varied scanning speeds. These actions led to variations in the geometries\nof microscale pores, and such variations were characterized using\nmicro-computed tomography. To generate differences in surface roughness in\nfatigue bars, half of the samples were grit-blasted and the other half\nmachined. Fatigue behaviors were analyzed with respect to surface roughness and\nstatistics of the pores. For the grit-blasted samples, the contour laser scan\nin the LPBF strategy led to a pore-depletion zone isolating surface and\ninternal pores with different features. For the machined samples, where surface\npores resemble internal pores, the fatigue life was highly correlated with the\naverage pore size and projected pore area in the plane perpendicular to the\nstress direction. Finally, a machine learning model using a drop-out neural\nnetwork (DONN) was employed to establish a link between surface and pore\nfeatures to the fatigue data (logN), and good prediction accuracy was\ndemonstrated. Besides predicting fatigue lives, the DONN can also estimate the\nprediction uncertainty.",

As the symbol\nrates of coherent transponders are increased to 100 Gbaud and beyond,\nmaintaining a high SPRR in a cost-effective manner becomes more and more\nchallenging. One potential approach for solving this problem is to leverage the\nconcept of single-ended coherent receiver (SER) where single-ended PDs are used\ninstead of the balanced PDs. In this case, the resulting SSBI should be\nmitigated in the digital domain. In this paper, we show that SSBI can be\neffectively mitigated using various low-complexity techniques, such as the\ndirect filed reconstruction (DFR), clipped iterative SSBI cancellation (CIC)\nand gradient decent (GD). In addition, we present a self-calibration technique\nfor SERs which can be extended for characterizing the optical-to-electrical\n(O/E) response of a conventional balanced coherent receiver (BR). Using the\ndeveloped techniques, we then experimentally demonstrate a 90 Gbaud\nprobabilistically constellation shaped 64-QAM (PCS-64QAM) transmission using a\nSER, achieving a net data rate of 882 Gb/s over 100 km of standard single mode\nfiber (SSMF).

    "abstract": "The Weakly-Compressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (WCSPH) method is a\nLagrangian method that is typically used for the simulation of incompressible\nfluids. While developing an SPH-based scheme or solver, researchers often\nverify their code with exact solutions, solutions from other numerical\ntechniques, or experimental data. This typically requires a significant amount\nof computational effort and does not test the full capabilities of the solver.\nFurthermore, often this does not yield insights on the convergence of the\nsolver. In this paper we introduce the method of manufactured solutions (MMS)\nto comprehensively test a WCSPH-based solver in a robust and efficient manner.\nThe MMS is well established in the context of mesh-based numerical solvers. We\nshow how the method can be applied in the context of Lagrangian WCSPH solvers\nto test the convergence and accuracy of the solver in two and three dimensions,\nsystematically identify any problems with the solver, and test the boundary\nconditions in an efficient way. We demonstrate this for both a traditional\nWCSPH scheme as well as for some recently proposed second order convergent\nWCSPH schemes. Our code is open source and the results of the manuscript are\nreproducible.",

    "title": "Deep Anomaly Generation: An Image Translation Approach of Synthesizing  Abnormal Banded Chromosome Images",
    "abstract": "Advances in deep-learning-based pipelines have led to breakthroughs in a\nvariety of microscopy image diagnostics. However, a sufficiently big training\ndata set is usually difficult to obtain due to high annotation costs. In the\ncase of banded chromosome images, the creation of big enough libraries is\ndifficult for multiple pathologies due to the rarity of certain genetic\ndisorders. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have proven to be effective\nin generating synthetic images and extending training data sets. In our work,\nwe implement a conditional adversarial network that allows generation of\nrealistic single chromosome images following user-defined banding patterns. To\nthis end, an image-to-image translation approach based on self-generated 2D\nchromosome segmentation label maps is used. Our validation shows promising\nresults when synthesizing chromosomes with seen as well as unseen banding\npatterns. We believe that this approach can be exploited for data augmentation\nof chromosome data sets with structural abnormalities. Therefore, the proposed\nmethod could help to tackle medical image analysis problems such as data\nsimulation, segmentation, detection, or classification in the field of\ncytogenetics.",

    "abstract": "Kernel analog forecasting (KAF) is a powerful methodology for data-driven,\nnon-parametric forecasting of dynamically generated time series data. This\napproach has a rigorous foundation in Koopman operator theory and it produces\ngood forecasts in practice, but it suffers from the heavy computational costs\ncommon to kernel methods. This paper proposes a streaming algorithm for KAF\nthat only requires a single pass over the training data. This algorithm\ndramatically reduces the costs of training and prediction without sacrificing\nforecasting skill. Computational experiments demonstrate that the streaming KAF\nmethod can successfully forecast several classes of dynamical systems\n(periodic, quasi-periodic, and chaotic) in both data-scarce and data-rich\nregimes. The overall methodology may have wider interest as a new template for\nstreaming kernel regression.",

    "abstract": "Time appears to pass irreversibly. In light of CPT symmetry, the Universe's\ninitial condition is thought to be somehow responsible. We propose a model, the\nstochastic partitioned cellular automaton (SPCA), in which to study the\nmechanisms and consequences of emergent irreversibility. While their most\nnatural definition is probabilistic, we show that SPCA dynamics can be made\ndeterministic and reversible, by attaching randomly initialized degrees of\nfreedom. This property motivates analogies to classical field theories. We\ndevelop the foundations of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics on SPCAs. Of\nparticular interest are the second law of thermodynamics, and a mutual\ninformation law which proves fundamental in non-equilibrium settings. We\nbelieve that studying the dynamics of information on SPCAs will yield insights\non foundational topics in computer engineering, the sciences, and the\nphilosophy of mind. As evidence of this, we discuss several such applications,\nincluding an extension of Landauer's principle, and sketch a physical\njustification of the causal decision theory that underlies the so-called\npsychological arrow of time.",

    "abstract": "Cosmic polarization rotation, which may result from parity-violating new\nphysics or the presence of primordial magnetic fields, converts $E$-mode\npolarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) into $B$-mode\npolarization. Anisotropic cosmic polarization rotation leads to statistical\nanisotropy in CMB polarization and can be reconstructed with quadratic\nestimator techniques similar to those designed for gravitational lensing of the\nCMB. At the sensitivity of upcoming CMB surveys, lensing-induced $B$-mode\npolarization will act as a limiting factor in the search for anisotropic cosmic\npolarization rotation, meaning that an analysis which incorporates some form of\ndelensing will be required to improve constraints on the effect with future\nsurveys. In this paper we extend the ResUNet-CMB convolutional neural network\nto reconstruct anisotropic cosmic polarization rotation in the presence of\ngravitational lensing and patchy reionization, and we show that the network\nsimultaneously reconstructs all three effects with variance that is lower than\nthat from the standard quadratic estimator nearly matching the performance of\nan iterative reconstruction method.",
