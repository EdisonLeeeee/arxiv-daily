    "title": "TANet: A new Paradigm for Global Face Super-resolution via  Transformer-CNN Aggregation Network",
    "abstract": "Recently, face super-resolution (FSR) methods either feed whole face image\ninto convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or utilize extra facial priors (e.g.,\nfacial parsing maps, facial landmarks) to focus on facial structure, thereby\nmaintaining the consistency of the facial structure while restoring facial\ndetails. However, the limited receptive fields of CNNs and inaccurate facial\npriors will reduce the naturalness and fidelity of the reconstructed face. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel paradigm based on the self-attention mechanism\n(i.e., the core of Transformer) to fully explore the representation capacity of\nthe facial structure feature. Specifically, we design a Transformer-CNN\naggregation network (TANet) consisting of two paths, in which one path uses\nCNNs responsible for restoring fine-grained facial details while the other\nutilizes a resource-friendly Transformer to capture global information by\nexploiting the long-distance visual relation modeling. By aggregating the\nfeatures from the above two paths, the consistency of global facial structure\nand fidelity of local facial detail restoration are strengthened\nsimultaneously. Experimental results of face reconstruction and recognition\nverify that the proposed method can significantly outperform the\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Square matrices appear in many machine learning problems and models.\nOptimization over a large square matrix is expensive in memory and in time.\nTherefore an economic approximation is needed. Conventional approximation\napproaches factorize the square matrix into a number matrices of much lower\nranks. However, the low-rank constraint is a performance bottleneck if the\napproximated matrix is intrinsically high-rank or close to full rank. In this\npaper, we propose to approximate a large square matrix with a product of sparse\nfull-rank matrices. In the approximation, our method needs only $N(\\log N)^2$\nnon-zero numbers for an $N\\times N$ full matrix. We present both non-parametric\nand parametric ways to find the factorization. In the former, we learn the\nfactorizing matrices directly, and in the latter, we train neural networks to\nmap input data to the non-zero matrix entries. The sparse factorization method\nis tested for a variety of synthetic and real-world square matrices. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that our method gives a better approximation\nwhen the approximated matrix is sparse and high-rank.

In coverage planning, the\nnumber of turns in the generated path affects the time to cover the environment\nand the quality of coverage, e.g. tools like cameras and cleaning attachments\ncommonly have poor performance around turns. In many existing turn-minimizing\ncoverage methods, the environment is partitioned into the least number of\nranks, which are non-intersecting rectangles of width equal to the robot's tool\nwidth. This partitioning problem is typically solved using heuristics that do\nnot guarantee optimality.

Recently, explorations in\ndevising such systems either take approaches that rely on semantic guarantees\nlike $k$-anonymity -- which can be easily subverted when combining with\nalternative information, and do not take into account the possibility that even\nknowledge of such clusters is privacy-invasive in themselves. Other approaches\nprovide full privacy by moving all data and processing logic to clients -- but\nwhich is prohibitively expensive for both clients and servers. In this work, we\ndevise a new framework called PrivateFetch for building practical ad-delivery\npipelines that rely on cryptographic hardness and best-case privacy, rather\nthan syntactic privacy guarantees or reliance on real-world anonymization\ntools. PrivateFetch utilizes local computation of preferences followed by\nhigh-performance single-server private information retrieval (PIR) to ensure\nthat clients can pre-fetch ad content from servers, without revealing any of\ntheir inherent characteristics to the content provider. When considering an\ndatabase of $>1,000,000$ ads, we show that we can deliver $30$ ads to a client\nin 40 seconds, with total communication costs of 192KB. We also demonstrate the\nfeasibility of PrivateFetch by showing that the monetary cost of running it is\nless than 1% of average ad revenue. As such, our system is capable of\npre-fetching ads for clients based on behavioral and contextual user\ninformation, before displaying them during a typical browsing session.

A leading\ndefense against such attacks is adversarial training, a technique in which a\nDNN is trained to be robust to adversarial attacks by introducing adversarial\nnoise to its input.

However,\nthis literature has yet to examine networks in terms of intervention, where\nnetwork mechanisms are manipulated to promote behavioral change and improve\nsocial, organizational, and community outcomes. Building on Valente's (2012)\ntypology, we develop a framework for strategies of public sector network\nintervention. First, we describe the core concepts in the theory of network\ninterventions found primarily in public health. Next, we expand the existing\ntypology of interventions to include macro-institutional strategies suited to\npublic administration settings. We then identify extant public sector\nliteratures that provide the building blocks for a framework for intervention.\nFinally, we classify the modes of intervention along three dimensions and\ndiscuss how each strategy might be implemented in practice. This typology\ncategorizes intervention strategies based on the processes targeted for change\n(network formation versus network effects), the types of nodes in the network\n(organizations versus individuals), and the level at which the intervention\noperates (macro versus micro). We provide scholars and practitioners a useful\nway to conceptualize where, why, and how network interventions might be\ndeployed. Ultimately, to fulfill the potential of network scholarship in public\nadministration, the field requires a framework for intervention approaches\ntailored to the relational and interdependent context of public problems.",

Key to the\nperformance of BO is specifying and refining a distribution over functions,\nwhich is used to reason about the optima of the underlying function being\noptimized. In this work, we consider the scenario where we have data from\nsimilar functions that allows us to specify a tighter distribution a priori.\nSpecifically, we focus on the common but potentially costly task of tuning\noptimizer parameters for training neural networks.

To meet the\nreal-time requirement, existing research proposed to apply the\nconnected-component-labeling (CCL) technique on LiDAR spherical range image\nwith a heuristic condition to check if two neighbor points are connected.\nHowever, LiDAR range image is different from a binary image which has a\ndeterministic condition to tell if two pixels belong to the same component. The\nheuristic condition used on the LiDAR range image only works empirically, which\nsuggests the LiDAR clustering algorithm should be robust to potential failures\nof the empirical heuristic condition. To overcome this challenge, this paper\nproposes a divide-and-merge LiDAR clustering algorithm. This algorithm firstly\nconducts clustering in each evenly divided local region, then merges the local\nclustered small components by voting on edge point pairs. Assuming there are\n$N$ LiDAR points of objects in total with $m$ divided local regions, the time\ncomplexity of the proposed algorithm is $O(N)+O(m^2)$. A smaller $m$ means the\nvoting will involve more neighbor points, but the time complexity will become\nlarger. So the $m$ controls the trade-off between the time complexity and the\nclustering accuracy. A proper $m$ helps the proposed algorithm work in\nreal-time as well as maintain good performance. We evaluate the\ndivide-and-merge clustering algorithm on the SemanticKITTI panoptic\nsegmentation benchmark by cascading it with a state-of-the-art semantic\nsegmentation model. The final performance evaluated through the leaderboard\nachieves the best among all published methods. The proposed algorithm is\nimplemented with C++ and wrapped as a python function. It can be easily used\nwith the modern deep learning framework in python.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by the increasing interest in the posit numeric format, in this\npaper we evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of posit arithmetic in contrast\nto the traditional IEEE 754 32-bit floating-point (FP32) arithmetic. We first\ndesign and implement a Posit Arithmetic Unit (PAU), called POSAR, with flexible\nbit-sized arithmetic suitable for applications that can trade accuracy for\nsavings in chip area. Next, we analyze the accuracy and efficiency of POSAR\nwith a series of benchmarks including mathematical computations, ML kernels,\nNAS Parallel Benchmarks (NPB), and Cifar-10 CNN. This analysis is done on our\nimplementation of POSAR integrated into a RISC-V Rocket Chip core in comparison\nwith the IEEE 754-based Floting Point Unit (FPU) of Rocket Chip. Our analysis\nshows that POSAR can outperform the FPU, but the results are not spectacular.\nFor NPB, 32-bit posit achieves better accuracy than FP32 and improves the\nexecution by up to 2%. However, POSAR with 32-bit posit needs 30% more FPGA\nresources compared to the FPU. For classic ML algorithms, we find that 8-bit\nposits are not suitable to replace FP32 because they exhibit low accuracy\nleading to wrong results. Instead, 16-bit posit offers the best option in terms\nof accuracy and efficiency. For example, 16-bit posit achieves the same Top-1\naccuracy as FP32 on a Cifar-10 CNN with a speedup of 18%.",

As part of their\nprotocol, TS@SE define inclusion and exclusion criteria (IC/EC) aimed at\nselecting those secondary studies (SS) to be included in the analysis. Aims: To\nprovide a state of the art on the definition and application of IC/EC in TS@SE,\nand from the results of this analysis, we outline an emerging framework,\nTSICEC, to be used by SE researchers. Method: To provide the state of the art,\nwe conducted a systematic mapping (SM) combining automatic search and\nsnowballing over the body of SE scientific literature, which led to 50 papers\nafter application of our own IC/EC. The extracted data was synthesised using\ncontent analysis. The results were used to define a first version of TSICEC.\nResults: The SM resulted in a coding schema, and a thorough analysis of the\nselected papers on the basis of this coding. Our TSICEC framework includes\nguidelines for the definition of IC/EC in TS@SE. Conclusion: This paper is a\nstep forward establishing a foundation for researchers in two ways.

    "abstract": "Present-day Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) systems show great promise\ntowards building intelligent agents surpassing human-level performance.\nHowever, the computational complexity associated with the underlying deep\nneural networks (DNNs) leads to power-hungry implementations. This makes deep\nRL systems unsuitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a reconfigurable architecture with\npreemptive exits for efficient deep RL (RAPID-RL). RAPID-RL enables conditional\nactivation of DNN layers based on the difficulty level of inputs. This allows\nto dynamically adjust the compute effort during inference while maintaining\ncompetitive performance. We achieve this by augmenting a deep Q-network (DQN)\nwith side-branches capable of generating intermediate predictions along with an\nassociated confidence score. We also propose a novel training methodology for\nlearning the actions and branch confidence scores in a dynamic RL setting. Our\nexperiments evaluate the proposed framework for Atari 2600 gaming tasks and a\nrealistic Drone navigation task on an open-source drone simulator (PEDRA). We\nshow that RAPID-RL incurs 0.34x (0.25x) number of operations (OPS) while\nmaintaining performance above 0.88x (0.91x) on Atari (Drone navigation) tasks,\ncompared to a baseline-DQN without any side-branches. The reduction in OPS\nleads to fast and efficient inference, proving to be highly beneficial for the\nresource-constrained edge where making quick decisions with minimal compute is\nessential.",

The dataset aims to provide demanding benchmark opportunities for\nalgorithms, rather than providing an environment for testing\napplication-specific solutions. A boat was selected as a logging platform in\norder to provide highly dynamic kinematics. The sensor package includes six\nhigh-performance vision sensors, two long-range lidars, radar, as well as GNSS\nand an IMU. The spatiotemporal resolution of sensors were maximized in order to\nprovide large variations and flexibility in the data, offering evaluation at a\nlarge number of different resolution presets based on the resolution found in\nother datasets. Reeds also provides means of a fair and reproducible comparison\nof algorithms, by running all evaluations on a common server backend. As the\ndataset contains massive-scale data, the evaluation principle also serves as a\nway to avoid moving data unnecessarily.\nIt was also found that naive evaluation of algorithms, where each evaluation\nis computed sequentially, was not practical as the fetch and decode task of\neach frame would not scale well. Instead, each frame is only decoded once and\nthen fed to all algorithms in parallel, including for GPU-based algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Bias in natural language processing arises primarily from models learning\ncharacteristics of the author such as gender and race when modelling tasks such\nas sentiment and syntactic parsing. This problem manifests as disparities in\nerror rates across author demographics, typically disadvantaging minority\ngroups. Existing methods for mitigating and measuring bias do not directly\naccount for correlations between author demographics and linguistic variables.\nMoreover, evaluation of bias has been inconsistent in previous work, in terms\nof dataset balance and evaluation methods. This paper introduces a very simple\nbut highly effective method for countering bias using instance reweighting,\nbased on the frequency of both task labels and author demographics. We extend\nthe method in the form of a gated model which incorporates the author\ndemographic as an input, and show that while it is highly vulnerable to input\ndata bias, it provides debiased predictions through demographic input\nperturbation, and outperforms all other bias mitigation techniques when\ncombined with instance reweighting.",

We propose a novel decentralized\nattack-resilient state-tracking algorithm based on the simple observation that\na compressed version of all the network measurements suffices to reconstruct\nthe state. This motivates a 2-step solution to the decentralized secure\nstate-tracking problem: (1) each node tracks the compressed version of all the\nnetwork measurements, and (2) each node asymptotically reconstructs the state\nfrom the output of step (1). We prove that, under mild technical assumptions,\nour algorithm enables each node to track the state of the linear system and\nthus solves the decentralized secure state-tracking problem.",

In this paper we demonstrate how an attacker\ncan exploit this oversight, highlighting a novel attack surface introduced by\nmachine unlearning.

LMs have emerged as a significant breakthrough in natural-language\nprocessing, providing capabilities that go far beyond sentence completion\nincluding question answering, summarization, and natural-language inference.\nWhile many of these capabilities have potential application to cognitive\nsystems, exploiting language models as a source of task knowledge, especially\nfor task learning, offers significant, near-term benefits. We introduce\nlanguage models and the various tasks to which they have been applied and then\nreview methods of knowledge extraction from language models. The resulting\nanalysis outlines both the challenges and opportunities for using language\nmodels as a new knowledge source for cognitive systems. It also identifies\npossible ways to improve knowledge extraction from language models using the\ncapabilities provided by cognitive systems. Central to success will be the\nability of a cognitive agent to itself learn an abstract model of the knowledge\nimplicit in the LM as well as methods to extract high-quality knowledge\neffectively and efficiently. To illustrate, we introduce a hypothetical robot\nagent and describe how language models could extend its task knowledge and\nimprove its performance and the kinds of knowledge and methods the agent can\nuse to exploit the knowledge within a language model.",

This paper presents ThriftyDAgger, an algorithm for\nactively querying a human supervisor given a desired budget of human\ninterventions. ThriftyDAgger uses a learned switching policy to solicit\ninterventions only at states that are sufficiently (1) novel, where the robot\npolicy has no reference behavior to imitate, or (2) risky, where the robot has\nlow confidence in task completion. To detect the latter, we introduce a novel\nmetric for estimating risk under the current robot policy. Experiments in\nsimulation and on a physical cable routing experiment suggest that\nThriftyDAgger's intervention criteria balances task performance and supervisor\nburden more effectively than prior algorithms. ThriftyDAgger can also be\napplied at execution time, where it achieves a 100% success rate on both the\nsimulation and physical tasks.

    "abstract": "Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is a problem of finding a sequence of\nmovements for agents to reach their assigned location without collision.\nCentralized algorithms usually give optimal solutions, but have difficulties to\nscale without employing various techniques - usually with a sacrifice of\noptimality; but solving MAPF problems with the number of agents greater than a\nthousand remains a challenge nevertheless. To tackle the scalability issue, we\npresent DMAPF - a decentralized and distributed MAPF solver, which is a\ncontinuation of our recently published work, ros-dmapf. We address the issues\nof ros-dmapf where it (i) only works in maps without obstacles; and (ii) has a\nlow success rate with dense maps. Given a MAPF problem, both ros-dmapf and\nDMAPF divide the map spatially into subproblems, but the latter further divides\neach subproblem into disconnected regions called areas. Each subproblem is\nassigned to a distributed solver, which then individually creates an abstract\nplan - a sequence of areas that an agent needs to visit - for each agent in it,\nand interleaves agent migration with movement planning. Answer Set Programming,\nwhich is known for its performance in small but complex problems, is used in\nmany parts including problem division, abstract planning, border assignment for\nthe migration, and movement planning. Robot Operating System is used to\nfacilitate communication between the solvers and to enable the opportunity to\nintegrate with robotic systems. DMAPF introduces a new interaction protocol\nbetween the solvers, and mechanisms that together result in a higher success\nrate and better solution quality without sacrificing much of the performance.\nWe implement and experimentally validate DMAPF by comparing it with other\nstate-of-the-art MAPF solvers and the results show that our system achieves\nbetter scalability.",

    "abstract": "Answer set programming (ASP) is an efficient problem-solving approach, which\nhas been strongly supported both scientifically and technologically by several\nsolvers, ongoing active research, and implementations in many different fields.\nHowever, although researchers acknowledged long ago the necessity of epistemic\noperators in the language of ASP for better introspective reasoning, this\nresearch venue did not attract much attention until recently. Moreover, the\nexisting epistemic extensions of ASP in the literature are not widely approved\neither, due to the fact that some propose unintended results even for some\nsimple acyclic epistemic programs, new unexpected results may possibly be\nfound, and more importantly, researchers have different reasonings for some\ncritical programs. To that end, Cabalar et al. have recently identified some\nstructural properties of epistemic programs to formally support a possible\nsemantics proposal of such programs and standardise their results. Nonetheless,\nthe soundness of these properties is still under debate, and they are not\nwidely accepted either by the ASP community. Thus, it seems that there is still\ntime to really understand the paradigm, have a mature formalism, and determine\nthe principles providing formal justification of their understandable models.\nIn this paper, we mainly focus on the existing semantics approaches, the\ncriteria that a satisfactory semantics is supposed to satisfy, and the ways to\nimprove them. We also extend some well-known propositions of here-and-there\nlogic (HT) into epistemic HT so as to reveal the real behaviour of programs.\nFinally, we propose a slightly novel semantics for epistemic ASP, which can be\nconsidered as a reflexive extension of Cabalar et al.'s recent formalism called\nautoepistemic ASP.",

    "abstract": "We tackle the problem of automatically designing concurrent data structure\noperations given a sequential data structure specification and knowledge about\nconcurrent behavior. Designing concurrent code is a non-trivial task even in\nsimplest of cases. Humans often design concurrent data structure operations by\ntransforming sequential versions into their respective concurrent versions.\nThis requires an understanding of the data structure, its sequential behavior,\nthread interactions during concurrent execution and shared memory\nsynchronization primitives. We mechanize this design process using automated\ncommonsense reasoning. We assume that the data structure description is\nprovided as axioms alongside the sequential code of its algebraic operations.\nThis information is used to automatically derive concurrent code for that data\nstructure, such as dictionary operations for linked lists and binary search\ntrees. Knowledge in our case is expressed using Answer Set Programming (ASP),\nand we employ deduction and abduction -- just as humans do -- in the reasoning\ninvolved. ASP allows for succinct modeling of first order theories of pointer\ndata structures, run-time thread interactions and shared memory\nsynchronization. Our reasoner can systematically make the same judgments as a\nhuman reasoner, while constructing provably safe concurrent code. We present\nseveral reasoning challenges involved in transforming the sequential data\nstructure into its equivalent concurrent version. All the reasoning tasks are\nencoded in ASP and our reasoner can make sound judgments to transform\nsequential code into concurrent code. To the best of our knowledge, our work is\nthe first one to use commonsense reasoning to automatically transform\nsequential programs into concurrent code. We also have developed a tool that we\ndescribe that relies on state-of-the-art ASP solvers and performs the reasoning\ntasks involved to generate concurrent code.",

Among these tasks automated planning has always been central in the\nAI research community. In particular, this manuscript is focused on a\nspecialized kind of planning known as Multi-agent Epistemic Planning (MEP).\nEpistemic Planning (EP) refers to an automated planning setting where the agent\nreasons in the space of knowledge/beliefs states and tries to find a plan to\nreach a desirable state from a starting one. Its general form, the MEP problem,\ninvolves multiple agents who need to reason about both the state of the world\nand the information flows between agents. To tackle the MEP problem several\ntools have been developed and, while the diversity of approaches has led to a\ndeeper understanding of the problem space, each proposed tool lacks some\nabilities and does not allow for a comprehensive investigation of the\ninformation flows. That is why, the objective of our work is to formalize an\nenvironment where a complete characterization of the agents' knowledge/beliefs\ninteraction and update is possible. In particular, we aim to achieve such goal\nby defining a new action-based language for multi-agent epistemic planning and\nto implement an epistemic planner based on it. This solver should provide a\ntool flexible enough to reason on different domains, e.g., economy, security,\njustice and politics, where considering others' knowledge/beliefs could lead to\nwinning strategies.",

When each of the\ntheories to be combined by the Nelson-Oppen method is convex (that is, any\nconjunction of its literals can imply a disjunction of equalities only when it\nimplies at least one of the equalities) and decidable in polynomial time, the\nrunning time of the combination procedure is guaranteed to be polynomial in the\nsize of the input formula.

These disjunctive\nformulas have good computational properties and play a pivotal role in the\ntheory of the modal mu-calculus. It is therefore an interesting question what\nthe best normalisation procedure is for rewriting a formula into an equivalent\ndisjunctive formula of minimal size. The best constructions that are known from\nthe literature are automata-theoretic in nature and consist of a guarded\ntransformation, i.e., the constructing of an equivalent guarded alternating\nautomaton from a mu-calculus formula, followed by a Simulation Theorem stating\nthat any such alternating automaton can be transformed into an equivalent\nnon-deterministic one. Both of these transformations are exponential\nconstructions, making the best normalisation procedure doubly exponential.

At the base of such a structuring there are algorithmic\nmotivations: each level corresponds to a step of the algorithm for the\nautomaton construction. The complex syntax of LTLEBR+P made it difficult to\nprecisely characterize its expressive power, and to compare it with other LTL+P\nsafety fragments.\nIn this paper, we first prove that LTLEBR+P is expressively complete with\nrespect to the safety fragment of LTL+P, that is, any safety language definable\nin LTL+P can be formalized in LTLEBR+P, and vice versa. From this, it follows\nthat LTLEBR+P and Safety-LTL are expressively equivalent.

    "abstract": "Understanding and visualizing the full-stack performance trade-offs and\ninterplay between HPC applications, MPI libraries, the communication fabric,\nand the file system is a challenging endeavor. Designing a holistic profiling\nand visualization method for HPC communication networks is challenging since\ndifferent levels of communication coexist and interact with each other on the\ncommunication fabric. A breakdown of traffic is essential to understand the\ninterplay of different layers along with the application's communication\nbehavior without losing a general view of network traffic. Unfortunately,\nexisting profiling tools are disjoint and either focus on only profiling and\nvisualizing a few levels of the HPC stack, which limits the insights they can\nprovide, or they provide extremely detailed information which necessitates a\nsteep learning curve to understand. We target our profiling tool visualization\nto provide holistic and real-time insights into HPC communication stacks.\nIn this paper, we propose and implement our visualization methods to enable\nholistic insight for representing the cross-stack metrics. Moreover, we propose\nand implement a low-overhead I/O profiling inside the communication library,\ncollect and store the profiling information, and then study the correlation and\nevaluation of I/O traffic with MPI communication using a cross-stack approach\nby INAM. Through experimental evaluations and use cases, we demonstrate novel\nbenefits of our cross-stack communication analysis in real-time to detect\nbottlenecks and understand communication performance.",

    "abstract": "In recommender systems (RecSys) and real-time bidding (RTB) for online\nadvertisements, we often try to optimize sequential decision making using\nbandit and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. In these applications,\noffline reinforcement learning (offline RL) and off-policy evaluation (OPE) are\nbeneficial because they enable safe policy optimization using only logged data\nwithout any risky online interaction. In this position paper, we explore the\npotential of using simulation to accelerate practical research of offline RL\nand OPE, particularly in RecSys and RTB. Specifically, we discuss how\nsimulation can help us conduct empirical research of offline RL and OPE. We\ntake a position to argue that we should effectively use simulations in the\nempirical research of offline RL and OPE. To refute the counterclaim that\nexperiments using only real-world data are preferable, we first point out the\nunderlying risks and reproducibility issue in real-world experiments. Then, we\ndescribe how these issues can be addressed by using simulations. Moreover, we\nshow how to incorporate the benefits of both real-world and simulation-based\nexperiments to defend our position. Finally, we also present an open challenge\nto further facilitate practical research of offline RL and OPE in RecSys and\nRTB, with respect to public simulation platforms. As a possible solution for\nthe issue, we show our ongoing open source project and its potential use case.\nWe believe that building and utilizing simulation-based evaluation platforms\nfor offline RL and OPE will be of great interest and relevance for the RecSys\nand RTB community.",

    "abstract": "This manuscript presents an algorithm for individual Lithium-ion (Li-ion)\nbattery cell state of charge (SOC) estimation in a large-scale battery pack\nunder minimal sensing, where only pack-level voltage and current are measured.\nFor battery packs consisting of up to thousands of cells in electric vehicle or\nstationary energy storage applications, it is desirable to estimate individual\ncell SOCs without cell local measurements in order to reduce sensing costs.\nMathematically, pure series connected cells yield dynamics given by ordinary\ndifferential equations under classical full voltage sensing. In contrast,\nparallel--series connected battery packs are evidently more challenging because\nthe dynamics are governed by a nonlinear differential--algebraic equations\n(DAE) system. The majority of the conventional studies on SOC estimation for\nbattery packs benefit from idealizing the pack as a lumped single cell which\nultimately lose track of cell-level conditions and are blind to potential risks\nof cell-level over-charge and over-discharge. This work explicitly models a\nbattery pack with high fidelity cell-by-cell resolution based on the\ninterconnection of single cell models, and examines the observability of\ncell-level state with only pack-level measurements. A DAE-based state observer\nwith linear output error injection is formulated, where the individual cell SOC\nand current can be reconstructed from minimal number of pack sensing. The\nmathematically guaranteed asymptotic convergence of differential and algebraic\nstate estimates is established by considering local Lipschitz continuity\nproperty of system nonlinearities. Simulation results for Graphite/NMC cells\nillustrate convergence for cell SOCs, currents, and voltages.",

However, when applied\nin the scenario of video recommendation, the traditional sentiment/emotion\nsystem is hard to be leveraged to represent different contents of videos in the\nperspective of visual senses and language understanding.

    "abstract": "Formulating cyber-security problems with attackers and defenders as a\npartially observable stochastic game has become a trend recently. Among them,\nthe one-sided two-player zero-sum partially observable stochastic game\n(OTZ-POSG) has emerged as a popular model because it allows players to compete\nfor multiple stages based on partial knowledge of the system. All existing work\non OTZ-POSG has focused on the simultaneous move scenario and assumed that one\nplayer's actions are private in the execution process. However, this assumption\nmay become questionable since one player's action may be detected by the\nopponent through deploying action detection strategies. Hence, in this paper,\nwe propose a turn-based OTZ-POSG with the assumption of public actions and\ninvestigate the existence and properties of a Stackelberg equilibrium for this\ngame. We first prove the existence of the Stackelberg equilibrium for the\none-stage case and show that the one-stage game can be converted into a\nlinear-fractional programming problem and therefore solved by linear\nprogramming. For multiple stages, the main challenge is the information leakage\nissue as the public run-time action reveals certain private information to the\nopponent and allows the opponent to achieve more rewards in the future. To deal\nwith this issue, we adopt the concept of $\\epsilon$-Stackelberg equilibrium and\nprove that this equilibrium can be achieved for finite-horizon OTZ-POSGs. We\npropose a space partition approach to solve the game iteratively and show that\nthe value function of the leader is piece-wise linear and the value function of\nthe follower is piece-wise constant for multiple stages. Finally, examples are\ngiven to illustrate the space partition approach and show that value functions\nare piece-wise linear and piece-wise constant.",

World\nModels have proven capable of learning spatial and temporal representations of\nReinforcement Learning environments. In some cases, a World Model offers an\nagent the opportunity to learn entirely inside of its own dream environment. In\nthis work we explore improving the generalization capabilities from dream\nenvironments to real environments (Dream2Real). We present a general approach\nto improve a controller's ability to transfer from a neural network dream\nenvironment to reality at little additional cost. These improvements are gained\nby drawing on inspiration from Domain Randomization, where the basic idea is to\nrandomize as much of a simulator as possible without fundamentally changing the\ntask at hand. Generally, Domain Randomization assumes access to a pre-built\nsimulator with configurable parameters but oftentimes this is not available. By\ntraining the World Model using dropout, the dream environment is capable of\ncreating a nearly infinite number of different dream environments. Previous use\ncases of dropout either do not use dropout at inference time or averages the\npredictions generated by multiple sampled masks (Monte-Carlo Dropout).\nDropout's Dream Land leverages each unique mask to create a diverse set of\ndream environments. Our experimental results show that Dropout's Dream Land is\nan effective technique to bridge the reality gap between dream environments and\nreality.

To tackle this\nproblem, we propose a fair VFL framework in this work. First, we systematically\nformulate the problem of training fair models in VFL, where the learning task\nis modeled as a constrained optimization problem. To solve it in a federated\nmanner, we consider its equivalent dual form and develop an asynchronous\ngradient coordinate-descent ascent algorithm, where each data party performs\nmultiple parallelized local updates per communication round to effectively\nreduce the number of communication rounds.

Knowledge distillation,\na major technique for deploying such a vast language model in resource-scarce\nenvironments, transfers the knowledge on individual word representations\nlearned without restrictions. In this paper, inspired by the recent\nobservations that language representations are relatively positioned and have\nmore semantic knowledge as a whole, we present a new knowledge distillation\nobjective for language representation learning that transfers the contextual\nknowledge via two types of relationships across representations: Word Relation\nand Layer Transforming Relation.

    "abstract": "In silico prediction of drug-target interactions (DTI) is significant for\ndrug discovery because it can largely reduce timelines and costs in the drug\ndevelopment process. Specifically, deep learning-based DTI approaches have been\nshown promising results in terms of accuracy and low cost for the prediction.\nHowever, they pay little attention to the interpretability of their prediction\nresults and feature-level interactions between a drug and a target. In this\nstudy, we propose a novel interpretable framework that can provide reasonable\ncues for the interaction sites. To this end, we elaborately design a gated\ncross-attention mechanism that crossly attends drug and target features by\nconstructing explicit interactions between these features. The gating function\nin the method enables neural models to focus on salient regions over entire\nsequences of drugs and proteins, and the byproduct from the function, which is\nthe attention map, could serve as interpretable factors. The experimental\nresults show the efficacy of the proposed method in two DTI datasets.\nAdditionally, we show that gated cross-attention can sensitively react to the\nmutation, and this result could provide insights into the identification of\nnovel drugs targeting mutant proteins.",

The Galerkin finite element method (GFEM) is a\ncommonly employed simulation tool, nonetheless, due to its inherent numerical\ninstability at higher velocities, the GFEM requires upwinding techniques to\nhandle moving conductor problems. The Streamline Upwinding/Petrov-Galerkin\n(SU/PG) scheme is a widely acknowledged upwinding technique, despite its\nerror-peaking at the transverse boundary. This error at the\ntransverse-boundary, is found to be leading to non-physical solutions.

The present work attempts to address\nthis issue, by retaining the computational efficiency of the GFEM. By suitable\nanalysis, it is shown that the source of the problem can be attributed to the\nCoulomb's gauge. Therefore, to solve the problem, the Coulomb's gauge is taken\nout from the formulation and the associated weak form is derived.

Most existing methods only consider visual cues, while\nneglect the accompanied audio information, which can provide complementary\ninformation for the scene understanding. In fact, there exists a strong\nrelation between auditory and visual cues, and humans generally perceive the\nsurrounding scene by simultaneously sensing these cues. Motivated by this, a\nbio-inspired audio-visual cues integration method is proposed for the VAP task,\nwhich explores the audio modality to better predict the visual attention map by\nassisting vision modality. The proposed method consists of three parts: 1)\naudio-visual encoding, 2) audio-visual location, and 3) multi-cues aggregation\nparts. Firstly, a refined SoundNet architecture is adopted to encode audio\nmodality for obtaining corresponding features, and a modified 3D ResNet-50\narchitecture is employed to learn visual features, containing both spatial\nlocation and temporal motion information. Secondly, an audio-visual location\npart is devised to locate the sound source in the visual scene by learning the\ncorrespondence between audio-visual information. Thirdly, a multi-cues\naggregation part is devised to adaptively aggregate audio-visual information\nand center-bias prior to generate the final visual attention map.

Most\nprevious studies have focused only on whether an algorithm selection system can\noutperform the single-best solver in a portfolio. In addition, a benchmarking\nmethodology for algorithm selection systems has not been well investigated in\nthe literature. In this context, this paper analyzes algorithm selection\nsystems on the 24 noiseless black-box optimization benchmarking functions.\nFirst, we demonstrate that the successful performance 1 measure is more\nreliable than the expected runtime measure for benchmarking algorithm selection\nsystems. Then, we examine the influence of randomness on the performance of\nalgorithm selection systems. We also show that the performance of algorithm\nselection systems can be significantly improved by using a pre-solver. We point\nout that the difficulty of outperforming the single-best solver depends on\nalgorithm portfolios, cross-validation methods, and dimensions.

The main control challenge in a SBW system is to\nfollow the steering commands in the face of parametric uncertainties, external\ndisturbances and actuator delay; crucially, perturbations in inertial\nparameters and damping forces give rise to state-dependent uncertainties, which\ncannot be bounded a priori by a constant. However, the state-of-the-art control\nmethods of SBW system rely on a priori bounded uncertainties, and thus, become\ninapplicable when state-dependent dynamics become unknown. In addition,\nensuring tracking accuracy under actuator delay is always a challenging task.\nThis work proposes two control frameworks to overcome these challenges.\nFirstly, an adaptive controller is proposed to tackle the state-dependent\nuncertainties and external disturbances in a typical SBW system without any a\npriori knowledge of their structures and of their bounds. The stability of the\nclosed-loop system is studied analytically via uniformly ultimately bounded\nnotion and the effectiveness of the proposed solution is verified via\nsimulations against the state-of-the-art solution. While this proposed\ncontroller handles the uncertainties and external perturbations, it does not\nconsider the actuator delay which sometimes result in decreased accuracy.\nTherefore, a new adaptive-robust control framework is devised to tackle the\nsame control problem of an SBW system under the influence of time-varying input\ndelay. In comparison to the existing strategies, the proposed framework removes\nthe conservative assumption of a priori bounded uncertainty and, in addition,\nthe Razumikhin theorem based stability analysis allows the proposed scheme to\ndeal with arbitrary variation in input delay. The effectiveness of the both\ncontrollers is proved using comparative simulation studies.",

By integrating the system of equations with some judiciously\nchosen test spaces on each element, we define new mixed virtual volume methods\nof all orders.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we describe a robust multi-drone planning framework for\nhigh-speed trajectories in large scenes. It uses a free-space-oriented map to\nfree the optimization from cumbersome environment data. A capsule-like safety\nconstraint is designed to avoid reciprocal collisions when vehicles deviate\nfrom their nominal flight progress under disturbance. We further show the\nminimum-singularity differential flatness of our drone dynamics with nonlinear\ndrag effects involved. Leveraging the flatness map, trajectory optimization is\nefficiently conducted on the flat outputs while still subject to physical\nlimits considering drag forces at high speeds. The robustness and effectiveness\nof our framework are both validated in large-scale simulations. It can compute\ncollision-free trajectories satisfying high-fidelity vehicle constraints for\nhundreds of drones in a few minutes.",

In this work, we use\ncentered kernel alignment (CKA), a method for comparing learned\nrepresentations, to measure the similarity of representations in task-tuned\nmodels across layers. In experiments across twelve NLU tasks, we discover a\nconsistent block diagonal structure in the similarity of representations within\nfine-tuned RoBERTa and ALBERT models, with strong similarity within clusters of\nearlier and later layers, but not between them. The similarity of later layer\nrepresentations implies that later layers only marginally contribute to task\nperformance, and we verify in experiments that the top few layers of fine-tuned\nTransformers can be discarded without hurting performance, even with no further\ntuning.",

    "abstract": "The recent success of Transformer has provided a new direction to various\nvisual understanding tasks, including video-based facial expression recognition\n(FER). By modeling visual relations effectively, Transformer has shown its\npower for describing complicated patterns. However, Transformer still performs\nunsatisfactorily to notice subtle facial expression movements, because the\nexpression movements of many videos can be too small to extract meaningful\nspatial-temporal relations and achieve robust performance. To this end, we\npropose to decompose each video into a series of expression snippets, each of\nwhich contains a small number of facial movements, and attempt to augment the\nTransformer's ability for modeling intra-snippet and inter-snippet visual\nrelations, respectively, obtaining the Expression snippet Transformer (EST). In\nparticular, for intra-snippet modeling, we devise an attention-augmented\nsnippet feature extractor (AA-SFE) to enhance the encoding of subtle facial\nmovements of each snippet by gradually attending to more salient information.\nIn addition, for inter-snippet modeling, we introduce a shuffled snippet order\nprediction (SSOP) head and a corresponding loss to improve the modeling of\nsubtle motion changes across subsequent snippets by training the Transformer to\nidentify shuffled snippet orders. Extensive experiments on four challenging\ndatasets (i.e., BU-3DFE, MMI, AFEW, and DFEW) demonstrate that our EST is\nsuperior to other CNN-based methods, obtaining state-of-the-art performance.",

    "abstract": "The conventional encoder-decoder framework for image captioning generally\nadopts a single-pass decoding process, which predicts the target descriptive\nsentence word by word in temporal order. Despite the great success of this\nframework, it still suffers from two serious disadvantages. Firstly, it is\nunable to correct the mistakes in the predicted words, which may mislead the\nsubsequent prediction and result in error accumulation problem. Secondly, such\na framework can only leverage the already generated words but not the possible\nfuture words, and thus lacks the ability of global planning on linguistic\ninformation. To overcome these limitations, we explore a universal two-pass\ndecoding framework, where a single-pass decoding based model serving as the\nDrafting Model first generates a draft caption according to an input image, and\na Deliberation Model then performs the polishing process to refine the draft\ncaption to a better image description. Furthermore, inspired from the\ncomplementarity between different modalities, we propose a novel Cross\nModification Attention (CMA) module to enhance the semantic expression of the\nimage features and filter out error information from the draft captions. We\nintegrate CMA with the decoder of our Deliberation Model and name it as Cross\nModification Attention based Deliberation Model (CMA-DM). We train our proposed\nframework by jointly optimizing all trainable components from scratch with a\ntrade-off coefficient. Experiments on MS COCO dataset demonstrate that our\napproach obtains significant improvements over single-pass decoding baselines\nand achieves competitive performances compared with other state-of-the-art\ntwo-pass decoding based methods.",

Repurposing arises in\neveryday situations such as finding substitutes for missing ingredients when\ncooking, or for unavailable tools when doing DIY. It also arises in critical,\nunprecedented situations needing crisis management. After natural disasters and\nduring wartime, people must repurpose the materials and processes available to\nmake shelter, distribute food, etc. Repurposing is equally important in\nprofessional life (e.g. clinicians often repurpose medicines off-license) and\nin addressing societal challenges (e.g. finding new roles for waste products,).\nDespite the importance of repurposing, the topic has received little academic\nattention. By considering examples from a variety of domains such as every-day\nactivities, drug repurposing and natural disasters, we identify some principle\ncharacteristics of the process and describe some technical challenges that\nwould be involved in modelling and simulating it. We consider cases of both\nsubstitution, i.e. finding an alternative for a missing resource, and\nexploitation, i.e. identifying a new role for an existing resource. We argue\nthat these ideas could be developed into general formal theory of repurposing,\nand that this could then lead to the development of AI methods based on\ncommonsense reasoning, argumentation, ontological reasoning, and various\nmachine learning methods, to develop tools to support repurposing in practice.",

On the other\nhand, their growing popularity might also attract those that aim at creating\nadversarial conditions to invalidate the benchmarking process, especially in\nthe case of public environments that allow the contribution from a large\ncommunity of people. Most of the existing Adversarial Machine Learning\napproaches are focused on static images, and little work has been done in\nstudying how to deal with 3D environments and how a 3D object should be altered\nto fool a classifier that observes it. In this paper, we study how to craft\nadversarial 3D objects by altering their textures, using a tool chain composed\nof easily accessible elements. We show that it is possible, and indeed simple,\nto create adversarial objects using off-the-shelf limited surrogate renderers\nthat can compute gradients with respect to the parameters of the rendering\nprocess, and, to a certain extent, to transfer the attacks to more advanced 3D\nengines. We propose a saliency-based attack that intersects the two classes of\nrenderers in order to focus the alteration to those texture elements that are\nestimated to be effective in the target engine, evaluating its impact in\npopular neural classifiers.",

    "abstract": "Lines provide the significantly richer geometric structural information about\nthe environment than points, so lines are widely used in recent Visual Odometry\n(VO) works. Since VO with lines use line tracking results to locate and map,\nline tracking is a crucial component in VO. Although the state-of-the-art line\ntracking methods have made great progress, they are still heavily dependent on\nline detection or the predicted line segments. In order to relieve the\ndependencies described above to track line segments completely, accurately, and\nrobustly at higher computational efficiency, we propose a structure-aware Line\ntracking algorithm based entirely on Optical Flow (LOF). Firstly, we propose a\ngradient-based strategy to sample pixels on lines that are suitable for line\noptical flow calculation. Then, in order to align the lines by fully using the\nstructural relationship between the sampled points on it and effectively\nremoving the influence of sampled points on it occluded by other objects, we\npropose a two-step structure-aware line segment alignment method. Furthermore,\nwe propose a line refinement method to refine the orientation, position, and\nendpoints of the aligned line segments. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed LOF outperforms the state-of-the-art performance\nin line tracking accuracy, robustness, and efficiency, which also improves the\nlocation accuracy and robustness of VO system with lines.",

They are trained to\npredict a fixed set of predefined categories, limiting their transferable\nability on new datasets with unseen concepts. In this paper, we provide a new\nperspective on action recognition by attaching importance to the semantic\ninformation of label texts rather than simply mapping them into numbers.\nSpecifically, we model this task as a video-text matching problem within a\nmultimodal learning framework, which strengthens the video representation with\nmore semantic language supervision and enables our model to do zero-shot action\nrecognition without any further labeled data or parameters requirements.\nMoreover, to handle the deficiency of label texts and make use of tremendous\nweb data, we propose a new paradigm based on this multimodal learning framework\nfor action recognition, which we dub \"pre-train, prompt and fine-tune\". This\nparadigm first learns powerful representations from pre-training on a large\namount of web image-text or video-text data. Then it makes the action\nrecognition task to act more like pre-training problems via prompt engineering.\nFinally, it end-to-end fine-tunes on target datasets to obtain strong\nperformance. We give an instantiation of the new paradigm, ActionCLIP, which\nnot only has superior and flexible zero-shot/few-shot transfer ability but also\nreaches a top performance on general action recognition task, achieving 83.8%\ntop-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400 with a ViT-B/16 as the backbone.

    "abstract": "Autonomous driving in urban crowds at unregulated intersections is\nchallenging, where dynamic occlusions and uncertain behaviors of other vehicles\nshould be carefully considered. Traditional methods are heuristic and based on\nhand-engineered rules and parameters, but scale poorly in new situations.\nTherefore, they require high labor cost to design and maintain rules in all\nforeseeable scenarios. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown\npromising results in urban driving scenarios. However, DRL is known to be\nsample inefficient, and most previous works assume perfect observations such as\nground-truth locations and motions of vehicles without considering noises and\nocclusions, which might be a too strong assumption for policy deployment. In\nthis work, we use DRL to train lidar-based end-to-end driving policies that\nnaturally consider imperfect partial observations. We further use unsupervised\ncontrastive representation learning as an auxiliary task to improve the sample\nefficiency. The comparative evaluation results reveal that our method achieves\nhigher success rates than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) lidar-based end-to-end\ndriving network, better trades off safety and efficiency than the carefully\ntuned rule-based method, and generalizes better to new scenarios than the\nbaselines.

However, the segmentation of complex documents into semantic regions is\nsometimes impossible relying only on visual features and recent models embed\nboth visual and textual information. In this paper, we focus on the use of both\nvisual and textual information for segmenting historical registers into\nstructured and meaningful units such as acts. An act is a text recording\ncontaining valuable knowledge such as demographic information (baptism,\nmarriage or death) or royal decisions (donation or pardon). We propose a simple\npipeline to enrich document images with the position of text lines containing\nkey-phrases and show that running a standard image-based layout analysis system\non these images can lead to significant gains.

While the effectiveness of learned\nindexes as an alternative to traditional index structures such as B+Trees have\nalready been demonstrated by several studies, previous work tend to focus on\nhigher-level performance metrics such as throughput and index size. In this\npaper, our goal is to dig deeper and investigate how learned indexes behave at\na micro-architectural level compared to traditional indexes.\nMore specifically, we focus on previously proposed learned index structure\nALEX, which is a tree-based in-memory index structure that consists of a\nhierarchy of machine learned models. Unlike the original proposal for learned\nindexes, ALEX is designed from the ground up to allow updates and inserts.\nTherefore, it enables more dynamic workloads using learned indexes. In this\nwork, we perform a micro-architectural analysis of ALEX and compare its\nbehavior to the tree-based index structures that are not based on learned\nmodels, i.e., ART and B+Tree.\nOur results show that ALEX is bound by memory stalls, mainly stalls due to\ndata misses from the last-level cache. Compared to ART and B+Tree, ALEX\nexhibits fewer stalls and a lower cycles-per-instruction value across different\nworkloads. On the other hand, the amount of instructions required to handle\nout-of-bound inserts in ALEX can increase the instructions needed per request\nsignificantly (10X) for write-heavy workloads. However, the micro-architectural\nbehavior shows that this increase in the instruction footprint exhibit high\ninstruction-level parallelism, and, therefore, does not negatively impact the\noverall execution time.",

Hence,\nthe proposed integer reparameterization does not need one-hot encoding and is\nof low dimensionality. Experiments show that the proposed SAC under integer\nactions is as good as the continuous action version on robot control tasks and\noutperforms Proximal Policy Optimization on power distribution systems control\ntasks.",

    "abstract": "Exploration of indoor environments has recently experienced a significant\ninterest, also thanks to the introduction of deep neural agents built in a\nhierarchical fashion and trained with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) on\nsimulated environments. Current state-of-the-art methods employ a dense\nextrinsic reward that requires the complete a priori knowledge of the layout of\nthe training environment to learn an effective exploration policy. However,\nsuch information is expensive to gather in terms of time and resources. In this\nwork, we propose to train the model with a purely intrinsic reward signal to\nguide exploration, which is based on the impact of the robot's actions on the\nenvironment. So far, impact-based rewards have been employed for simple tasks\nand in procedurally generated synthetic environments with countable states.\nSince the number of states observable by the agent in realistic indoor\nenvironments is non-countable, we include a neural-based density model and\nreplace the traditional count-based regularization with an estimated\npseudo-count of previously visited states. The proposed exploration approach\noutperforms DRL-based competitors relying on intrinsic rewards and surpasses\nthe agents trained with a dense extrinsic reward computed with the environment\nlayouts. We also show that a robot equipped with the proposed approach\nseamlessly adapts to point-goal navigation and real-world deployment.",

In essence, the scheduler maps each\narriving job to one of the possibly heterogeneous servers while aiming at an\noptimization goal such as load balancing, low average delay or low loss rate.\nOne main difficulty in finding optimal scheduling decisions here is that the\nscheduler only partially observes the impact of its decisions, e.g., through\nthe delayed acknowledgements of the served jobs. In this paper, we provide a\npartially observable (PO) model that captures the scheduling decisions in\nparallel queuing systems under limited information of delayed acknowledgements.\nWe present a simulation model for this PO system to find a near-optimal\nscheduling policy in real-time using a scalable Monte Carlo tree search\nalgorithm.

As a\nconsequence, those in charge of developing these models must carefully evaluate\ntheir impact on different groups of people and ensure that sensitive\ndemographic attributes, such as race or sex, do not result in unfair treatment\nfor members of specific groups. For doing this, awareness of demographic\nattributes on the part of those evaluating model impacts is fundamental.\nUnfortunately, the collection of these attributes is often in conflict with\nindustry practices and legislation on data minimization and privacy. For this\nreason, it may be hard to measure the group fairness of trained models, even\nfrom within the companies developing them. In this work, we tackle the problem\nof measuring group fairness under unawareness of sensitive attributes, by using\ntechniques from quantification, a supervised learning task concerned with\ndirectly providing group-level prevalence estimates (rather than\nindividual-level class labels). We identify five important factors that\ncomplicate the estimation of fairness under unawareness and formalize them into\nfive different experimental protocols under which we assess the effectiveness\nof different estimators of group fairness.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a direct construction of Golay complementary pairs (GCPs)\nand binary complete complementary codes (CCCs) of non power of two lengths.\nCCCs have found wide range of practical applications including coding, signal\nprocessing and wireless communication due to their zero auto and\ncross-correlation sum properties. It is the first time GCPs of non power of two\nlengths are constructed using generalised Boolean functions (GBFs). We have\ntruncated the tail of the sequence in generating non power of two length\nsequences. The idea is further extended to generate complementary sets (CSs).\nFinally, binary CCCs are constructed using CSs and its mate. To the best of\nauthors' knowledge the direct construction of GCPs and binary CCCs of non power\nof two length doesn't exist in literature. We have also investigated the row\nand column sequence peak to mean envelope power ratio (PMEPR) of the generated\nsequences.",

However, annotating\ndata or even having balanced number of samples can be a luxury for\npractitioners from different scientific fields, e.g., in the medical domain. To\nthat end, we propose a NAS-based framework that bears the threefold\ncontributions: (a) we focus on the self-supervised scenario, i.e., where no\nlabels are required to determine the architecture, and (b) we assume the\ndatasets are imbalanced, (c) we design each component to be able to run on a\nresource constrained setup, i.e., on a single GPU (e.g. Google Colab). Our\ncomponents build on top of recent developments in self-supervised\nlearning~\\citep{zbontar2021barlow}, self-supervised NAS~\\citep{kaplan2020self}\nand extend them for the case of imbalanced datasets. We conduct experiments on\nan (artificially) imbalanced version of CIFAR-10 and we demonstrate our\nproposed method outperforms standard neural networks, while using $27\\times$\nless parameters. To validate our assumption on a naturally imbalanced dataset,\nwe also conduct experiments on ChestMNIST and COVID-19 X-ray. The results\ndemonstrate how the proposed method can be used in imbalanced datasets, while\nit can be fully run on a single GPU.

    "abstract": "Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC), which aims to predict text labels\norganized in hierarchical space, is a significant task lacking in investigation\nin natural language processing. Existing methods usually encode the entire\nhierarchical structure and fail to construct a robust label-dependent model,\nmaking it hard to make accurate predictions on sparse lower-level labels and\nachieving low Macro-F1. In this paper, we propose a novel PAMM-HiA-T5 model for\nHTC: a hierarchy-aware T5 model with path-adaptive mask mechanism that not only\nbuilds the knowledge of upper-level labels into low-level ones but also\nintroduces path dependency information in label prediction. Specifically, we\ngenerate a multi-level sequential label structure to exploit hierarchical\ndependency across different levels with Breadth-First Search (BFS) and T5\nmodel. To further improve label dependency prediction within each path, we then\npropose an original path-adaptive mask mechanism (PAMM) to identify the label's\npath information, eliminating sources of noises from other paths. Comprehensive\nexperiments on three benchmark datasets show that our novel PAMM-HiA-T5 model\ngreatly outperforms all state-of-the-art HTC approaches especially in Macro-F1.\nThe ablation studies show that the improvements mainly come from our innovative\napproach instead of T5.",

    "title": "Diverse Generation from a Single Video Made Possible",
    "abstract": "Most advanced video generation and manipulation methods train on a large\ncollection of videos. As such, they are restricted to the types of video\ndynamics they train on. To overcome this limitation, GANs trained on a single\nvideo were recently proposed. While these provide more flexibility to a wide\nvariety of video dynamics, they require days to train on a single tiny input\nvideo, rendering them impractical. In this paper we present a fast and\npractical method for video generation and manipulation from a single natural\nvideo, which generates diverse high-quality video outputs within seconds (for\nbenchmark videos). Our method can be further applied to Full-HD video clips\nwithin minutes. Our approach is inspired by a recent advanced\npatch-nearest-neighbor based approach [Granot et al. 2021], which was shown to\nsignificantly outperform single-image GANs, both in run-time and in visual\nquality. Here we generalize this approach from images to videos, by casting\nclassical space-time patch-based methods as a new generative video model. We\nadapt the generative image patch nearest neighbor approach to efficiently cope\nwith the huge number of space-time patches in a single video. Our method\ngenerates more realistic and higher quality results than single-video GANs\n(confirmed by quantitative and qualitative evaluations). Moreover, it is\ndisproportionally faster (runtime reduced from several days to seconds). Other\nthan diverse video generation, we demonstrate several other challenging video\napplications, including spatio-temporal video retargeting, video structural\nanalogies and conditional video-inpainting.",

It is thus imperative to devise strategies to mitigate and, if\npossible, harness optical and electrical noises in photonic computing systems.\nHere, we demonstrate a prototypical photonic generative adversarial network\n(GAN) that generates handwritten numbers using a photonic core consisting of an\narray of programable phase-change optical memory cells. We harness\noptoelectronic noises in the photonic GAN by realizing an optical random number\ngenerator derived from the amplified spontaneous emission noise, applying\nnoise-aware training by injecting additional noise to the network, and\nimplementing the trained network with resilience to hardware non-idealities.\nSurprisingly, the photonic GAN with hardware noises and inaccuracies can\ngenerate images of even higher quality than the noiseless software baseline.\nOur results suggest the resilience and potential of more complex photonic\ngenerative networks based on large-scale, non-ideal photonic hardware. The\ndemonstrated GAN architecture and the proposed noise-aware training approach\nare generic and thus applicable to various types of optoelectronic neuromorphic\ncomputing hardware.",

Recent QE\nmodels have achieved previously-unseen levels of correlation with human\njudgments, but they rely on large multilingual contextualized language models\nthat are computationally expensive and make them infeasible for real-world\napplications. In this work, we evaluate several model compression techniques\nfor QE and find that, despite their popularity in other NLP tasks, they lead to\npoor performance in this regression setting. We observe that a full model\nparameterization is required to achieve SoTA results in a regression task.\nHowever, we argue that the level of expressiveness of a model in a continuous\nrange is unnecessary given the downstream applications of QE, and show that\nreframing QE as a classification problem and evaluating QE models using\nclassification metrics would better reflect their actual performance in\nreal-world applications.",

    "abstract": "Fuzz testing, or fuzzing, has become one of the de facto standard techniques\nfor bug finding in the software industry. In general, fuzzing provides various\ninputs to the target program to discover unhandled exceptions and crashes. In\nbusiness sectors where the time budget is limited, software vendors often\nlaunch many fuzzing instances in parallel as common means of increasing code\ncoverage. However, most of the popular fuzzing tools in their parallel\nmode-naively run multiple instances concurrently, without elaborate\ndistribution of workload. This can lead different instances to explore\noverlapped code regions, eventually reducing the benefits of concurrency. In\nthis paper, we propose a general model to describe parallel fuzzing. This model\ndistributes mutually-exclusive but similarly-weighted tasks to different\ninstances, facilitating concurrency and also fairness across instances.\nFollowing this model, we develop a solution, called AFL-EDGE, to improve the\nparallel mode of AFL, considering a round of mutations to a unique seed as a\ntask and adopting edge coverage to define the uniqueness of a seed. We have\nimplemented AFL-EDGE on top of AFL and evaluated the implementation with AFL on\n9 widely used benchmark programs. It shows that AFL-EDGE can benefit the edge\ncoverage of AFL. In a 24-hour test, the increase of edge coverage brought by\nAFL-EDGE to AFL ranges from 9.49% to 10.20%, depending on the number of\ninstances. As a side benefit, we discovered 14 previously unknown bugs.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic vision sensor (DVS) event camera output is affected by noise,\nparticularly in dim lighting conditions. A theory explaining how photon and\nelectron noise affect DVS output events has so far not been developed.\nMoreover, there is no clear understanding of how DVS parameters and operating\nconditions affect noise. There is an apparent paradox between the real noise\ndata observed from the DVS output and the reported noise measurements of the\nlogarithmic photoreceptor. While measurements of the logarithmic photoreceptor\npredict that the photoreceptor is approximately a first-order system with RMS\nnoise voltage independent of the photocurrent, DVS output shows higher noise\nevent rates at low light intensity. This paper unravels this paradox by showing\nhow the DVS photoreceptor is a second-order system, and the assumption that it\nis first-order is generally not reasonable. As we show, at higher\nphotocurrents, the photoreceptor amplifier dominates the frequency response,\ncausing a drop in RMS noise voltage and noise event rate. We bring light to the\nnoise performance of the DVS photoreceptor by presenting a theoretical\nexplanation supported by both transistor-level simulation results and chip\nmeasurements.",

    "abstract": "While the rapid progress of deep learning fuels end-to-end reinforcement\nlearning (RL), direct application, especially in high-dimensional space like\nrobotic scenarios still suffers from high sample efficiency. Therefore State\nRepresentation Learning (SRL) is proposed to specifically learn to encode\ntask-relevant features from complex sensory data into low-dimensional states.\nHowever, the pervasive implementation of SRL is usually conducted by a\ndecoupling strategy in which the observation-state mapping is learned\nseparately, which is prone to over-fit. To handle such problem, we present a\nnew algorithm called Policy Optimization via Abstract Representation which\nintegrates SRL into the original RL scale. Firstly, We engage RL loss to assist\nin updating SRL model so that the states can evolve to meet the demand of\nreinforcement learning and maintain a good physical interpretation. Secondly,\nwe introduce a dynamic parameter adjustment mechanism so that both models can\nefficiently adapt to each other. Thirdly, we introduce a new prior called\ndomain resemblance to leverage expert demonstration to train the SRL model.\nFinally, we provide a real-time access by state graph to monitor the course of\nlearning. Results show that our algorithm outperforms the PPO baselines and\ndecoupling strategies in terms of sample efficiency and final rewards. Thus our\nmodel can efficiently deal with tasks in high dimensions and facilitate\ntraining real-life robots directly from scratch.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of fairly allocating a set of indivisible goods to a\nset of strategic agents with additive valuation functions. We assume no\nmonetary transfers and, therefore, a mechanism in our setting is an algorithm\nthat takes as input the reported -- rather than the true -- values of the\nagents. Our main goal is to explore whether there exist mechanisms that have\npure Nash equilibria for every instance and, at the same time, provide fairness\nguarantees for the allocations that correspond to these equilibria. We focus on\ntwo relaxations of envy-freeness, namely envy-freeness up to one good (EF1),\nand envy-freeness up to any good (EFX), and we positively answer the above\nquestion. In particular, we study two algorithms that are known to produce such\nallocations in the non-strategic setting: Round-Robin (EF1 allocations for any\nnumber of agents) and a cut-and-choose algorithm of Plaut and Roughgarden [SIAM\nJournal of Discrete Mathematics, 2020] (EFX allocations for two agents). For\nRound-Robin we show that all of its pure Nash equilibria induce allocations\nthat are EF1 with respect to the underlying true values, while for the\nalgorithm of Plaut and Roughgarden we show that the corresponding allocations\nnot only are EFX but also satisfy maximin share fairness, something that is not\ntrue for this algorithm in the non-strategic setting! Further, we show that a\nweaker version of the latter result holds for any mechanism for two agents that\nalways has pure Nash equilibria which all induce EFX allocations.",

    "title": "Aggregate Semantics for Propositional Answer Set Programs",
    "abstract": "Answer Set Programming (ASP) emerged in the late 1990ies as a paradigm for\nKnowledge Representation and Reasoning. The attractiveness of ASP builds on an\nexpressive high-level modeling language along with the availability of powerful\noff-the-shelf solving systems. While the utility of incorporating aggregate\nexpressions in the modeling language has been realized almost simultaneously\nwith the inception of the first ASP solving systems, a general semantics of\naggregates and its efficient implementation have been long-standing challenges.\nAggregates have been proposed and widely used in database systems, and also in\nthe deductive database language Datalog, which is one of the main precursors of\nASP. The use of aggregates was, however, still restricted in Datalog (by either\ndisallowing recursion or only allowing monotone aggregates), while several ways\nto integrate unrestricted aggregates evolved in the context of ASP. In this\nsurvey, we pick up at this point of development by presenting and comparing the\nmain aggregate semantics that have been proposed for propositional ASP\nprograms. We highlight crucial properties such as computational complexity and\nexpressive power, and outline the capabilities and limitations of different\napproaches by illustrative examples.",

    "abstract": "We present a distributed algorithm that enables a group of robots to\ncollaboratively optimize the parameters of a deep neural network model while\ncommunicating over a mesh network. Each robot only has access to its own data\nand maintains its own version of the neural network, but eventually learns a\nmodel that is as good as if it had been trained on all the data centrally. No\nrobot sends raw data over the wireless network, preserving data privacy and\nensuring efficient use of wireless bandwidth. At each iteration, each robot\napproximately optimizes an augmented Lagrangian function, then communicates the\nresulting weights to its neighbors, updates dual variables, and repeats.\nEventually, all robots' local network weights reach a consensus. For convex\nobjective functions, we prove this consensus is a global optimum.

    "abstract": "Large Transformer models have been central to recent advances in natural\nlanguage processing. The training and inference costs of these models, however,\nhave grown rapidly and become prohibitively expensive. Here we aim to reduce\nthe costs of Transformers by searching for a more efficient variant. Compared\nto previous approaches, our search is performed at a lower level, over the\nprimitives that define a Transformer TensorFlow program. We identify an\narchitecture, named Primer, that has a smaller training cost than the original\nTransformer and other variants for auto-regressive language modeling. Primer's\nimprovements can be mostly attributed to two simple modifications: squaring\nReLU activations and adding a depthwise convolution layer after each Q, K, and\nV projection in self-attention.\nExperiments show Primer's gains over Transformer increase as compute scale\ngrows and follow a power law with respect to quality at optimal model sizes. We\nalso verify empirically that Primer can be dropped into different codebases to\nsignificantly speed up training without additional tuning. For example, at a\n500M parameter size, Primer improves the original T5 architecture on C4\nauto-regressive language modeling, reducing the training cost by 4X.\nFurthermore, the reduced training cost means Primer needs much less compute to\nreach a target one-shot performance. For instance, in a 1.9B parameter\nconfiguration similar to GPT-3 XL, Primer uses 1/3 of the training compute to\nachieve the same one-shot performance as Transformer. We open source our models\nand several comparisons in T5 to help with reproducibility.",

    "abstract": "We consider a network consisting of a single source and $n$ receiver nodes\nthat are grouped into equal-sized clusters. We use cluster heads in each\ncluster to facilitate communication between the source and the nodes within\nthat cluster. Inside clusters, nodes are connected to each other according to a\ngiven network topology. Based on the connectivity among the nodes, each node\nrelays its current stored version of the source update to its neighboring nodes\nby $local$ $gossiping$. We use the $version$ $age$ metric to assess information\nfreshness at the nodes. We consider disconnected, ring, and fully connected\nnetwork topologies for each cluster. For each network topology, we characterize\nthe average version age at each node and find the average version age scaling\nas a function of the network size $n$. Our results indicate that per node\naverage version age scalings of $O(\\sqrt{n})$, $O(n^{\\frac{1}{3}})$, and\n$O(\\log n)$ are achievable in disconnected, ring, and fully connected cluster\nmodels, respectively. Next, we increase connectivity in the network and allow\ngossiping among the cluster heads to improve version age at the nodes. With\nthat, we show that when the cluster heads form a ring network among themselves,\nwe obtain per node average version age scalings of $O(n^{\\frac{1}{3}})$,\n$O(n^{\\frac{1}{4}})$, and $O(\\log n)$ in disconnected, ring, and fully\nconnected cluster models, respectively. Next, focusing on a ring network\ntopology in each cluster, we introduce hierarchy to the considered clustered\ngossip network model and show that when we employ two levels of hierarchy, we\ncan achieve the same $O(n^{\\frac{1}{4}})$ scaling without using dedicated\ncluster heads. We generalize this result for $h$ levels of hierarchy and show\nthat per user average version age scaling of $O(n^{\\frac{1}{2h}})$ is\nachievable in the case of a ring network in each cluster across all hierarchy\nlevels.",

Multiple challenges have to be overcome in\nthis field, such as; monitoring the precise spatial location of the person, and\nestimating vital signs like an individuals average temperature. Privacy is\nanother domain of the problem to be thought of with care. Identifying the\npersons posture without a camera is another challenge. Posture identification\nassists in the persons fall detection. Thermal imaging could be a proper\nsolution for most of the mentioned challenges. It provides monitoring both the\npersons average temperature and spatial location while maintaining privacy.

Three classes of ADLs are introduced, which are\ndaily activity, sleeping activity and no-activity respectively. Estimating\nperson average temperature using TSAs is introduced as well in this paper.\nResults have shown that the three activity classes can be identified as well as\nthe persons average temperature during day and night.

    "abstract": "We propose a novel architecture and training paradigm for training realistic\nPointGoal Navigation -- navigating to a target coordinate in an unseen\nenvironment under actuation and sensor noise without access to ground-truth\nlocalization. Specifically, we find that the primary challenge under this\nsetting is learning localization -- when stripped of idealized localization,\nagents fail to stop precisely at the goal despite reliably making progress\ntowards it. To address this we introduce a set of auxiliary losses to help the\nagent learn localization. Further, we explore the idea of treating the precise\nlocation of the agent as privileged information -- it is unavailable during\ntest time, however, it is available during training time in simulation. We\ngrant the agent restricted access to ground-truth localization readings during\ntraining via an information bottleneck. Under this setting, the agent incurs a\npenalty for using this privileged information, encouraging the agent to only\nleverage this information when it is crucial to learning. This enables the\nagent to first learn navigation and then learn localization instead of\nconflating these two objectives in training. We evaluate our proposed method\nboth in a semi-idealized (noiseless simulation without Compass+GPS) and\nrealistic (addition of noisy simulation) settings. Specifically, our method\noutperforms existing baselines on the semi-idealized setting by 18\\%/21\\%\nSPL/Success and by 15\\%/20\\% SPL in the realistic setting.

This algorithm presents a genuine\nquantum counterpart to decoding based on classical belief propagation, which\nhas found wide success in classical coding theory when used in conjunction with\nLDPC or Turbo codes.

Here we\nsignificantly expand the understanding, formalism, and applicability of the\nBPQM algorithm with the following contributions. First, we prove analytically\nthat BPQM realizes optimal decoding for any binary linear code with tree Tanner\ngraph. We also provide the first formal description of the BPQM algorithm in\nfull detail and without any ambiguity. In so doing, we identify a key flaw\noverlooked in the original algorithm and subsequent works which implies quantum\ncircuit realizations will be exponentially large in the code size. Although\nBPQM passes quantum messages, other information required by the algorithm is\nprocessed globally. We remedy this problem by formulating a truly\nmessage-passing algorithm which approximates BPQM and has circuit complexity\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\text{poly } n, \\text{polylog } \\frac{1}{\\epsilon})$, where $n$ is\nthe code length and $\\epsilon$ is the approximation error.

We evaluate these\nsolutions by surveying ten experts - surgeons who routinely perform endoscopic\nsurgery. We run two separate reader studies: one evaluating individual frames\nand the other evaluating fully reconstructed 3D video played on a VR headset.\nIn the first reader study, a variant of the U-Net that takes as input multiple\nconsecutive video frames and outputs the missing view performs best. We draw\ntwo conclusions from this outcome. First, motion information coming from\nmultiple past frames is crucial in recreating stereo vision. Second, the\nproposed U-Net variant can indeed exploit such motion information for solving\nthis task. The result from the second study further confirms the effectiveness\nof the proposed U-Net variant. The surgeons reported that they could\nsuccessfully perceive depth from the reconstructed 3D video clips.

    "title": "Policy Choice and Best Arm Identification: Comments on \"Adaptive  Treatment Assignment in Experiments for Policy Choice\"",
    "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to connect the \"policy choice\" problem, proposed\nin Kasy and Sautmann (2021), to the frontiers of the bandit literature in\nmachine learning. We discuss how the policy choice problem can be framed in a\nway such that it is identical to what is called the \"best arm identification\"\n(BAI) problem. By connecting the literature, we identify that the asymptotic\noptimality of policy choice algorithms tackled in Kasy and Sautmann (2021) is a\nlong-standing open question in the literature. Unfortunately, this connection\nhighlights several major issues with the main theorem. In particular, we show\nthat Theorem 1 in Kasy and Sautmann (2021) is false. We find that the proofs of\nstatements (1) and (2) of Theorem 1 are incorrect, though the statements\nthemselves may be true, though non-trivial to fix. Statement (3), and its\nproof, on the other hand, is false, which we show by utilizing existing\ntheoretical results in the bandit literature. As this question is critically\nimportant, garnering much interest in the last decade within the bandit\ncommunity, we provide a review of recent developments in the BAI literature. We\nhope this serves to highlight the relevance to economic problems and stimulate\nmethodological and theoretical developments in the econometric community.",

    "abstract": "We use Gaussian stochastic weight averaging (SWAG) to assess the model-form\nuncertainty associated with neural-network-based function approximation\nrelevant to fluid flows. SWAG approximates a posterior Gaussian distribution of\neach weight, given training data, and a constant learning rate. Having access\nto this distribution, it is able to create multiple models with various\ncombinations of sampled weights, which can be used to obtain ensemble\npredictions. The average of such an ensemble can be regarded as the `mean\nestimation', whereas its standard deviation can be used to construct\n`confidence intervals', which enable us to perform uncertainty quantification\n(UQ) with regard to the training process of neural networks. We utilize\nrepresentative neural-network-based function approximation tasks for the\nfollowing cases: (i) a two-dimensional circular-cylinder wake; (ii) the DayMET\ndataset (maximum daily temperature in North America); (iii) a three-dimensional\nsquare-cylinder wake; and (iv) urban flow, to assess the generalizability of\nthe present idea for a wide range of complex datasets. SWAG-based UQ can be\napplied regardless of the network architecture, and therefore, we demonstrate\nthe applicability of the method for two types of neural networks: (i) global\nfield reconstruction from sparse sensors by combining convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP); and (ii) far-field state\nestimation from sectional data with two-dimensional CNN. We find that SWAG can\nobtain physically-interpretable confidence-interval estimates from the\nperspective of model-form uncertainty. This capability supports its use for a\nwide range of problems in science and engineering.",

    "abstract": "The rapid development of affordable and compact high-fidelity sensors (e.g.,\ncameras and LIDAR) allows robots to construct detailed estimates of their\nstates and environments. However, the availability of such rich sensor\ninformation introduces two technical challenges: (i) the lack of analytic\nsensing models, which makes it difficult to design controllers that are robust\nto sensor failures, and (ii) the computational expense of processing the\nhigh-dimensional sensor information in real time. This paper addresses these\nchallenges using the theory of differential privacy, which allows us to (i)\ndesign controllers with bounded sensitivity to errors in state estimates, and\n(ii) bound the amount of state information used for control (i.e., to impose\nbounded rationality). The resulting framework approximates the separation\nprinciple and allows us to derive an upper-bound on the cost incurred with a\nfaulty state estimator in terms of three quantities: the cost incurred using a\nperfect state estimator, the magnitude of state estimation errors, and the\nlevel of differential privacy.

Our system uses a modular approach,\nconsisting of a pose estimation module and a gesture classifier. Pose estimates\nare predicted from lidar scans using a Convolutional Neural Network trained\nusing an existing stereo-based pose estimation system. Gesture classification\nis accomplished using a Long Short-Term Memory network and uses a sequence of\nestimated body poses as input to predict a gesture. Breaking down the pipeline\ninto two modules reduces the dimensionality of the input, which could be lidar\nscans, stereo imagery, or any other modality from which body keypoints can be\nextracted, making our system lightweight and suitable for mobile robot control\nwith limited computing power. The use of lidar contributes to the robustness of\nthe system, allowing it to operate in most outdoor conditions, to be\nindependent of lighting conditions, and for input to be detected 360 degrees\naround the robot. The lidar-based pose estimator and gesture classifier use\ndata augmentation and automated labeling techniques, requiring a minimal amount\nof data collection and avoiding the need for manual labeling.

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning provides great significance in left atrium (LA)\nsegmentation model learning with insufficient labelled data. Generalising\nsemi-supervised learning to cross-domain data is of high importance to further\nimprove model robustness. However, the widely existing distribution difference\nand sample mismatch between different data domains hinder the generalisation of\nsemi-supervised learning. In this study, we alleviate these problems by\nproposing an Adaptive Hierarchical Dual Consistency (AHDC) for the\nsemi-supervised LA segmentation on cross-domain data. The AHDC mainly consists\nof a Bidirectional Adversarial Inference module (BAI) and a Hierarchical Dual\nConsistency learning module (HDC). The BAI overcomes the difference of\ndistributions and the sample mismatch between two different domains. It mainly\nlearns two mapping networks adversarially to obtain two matched domains through\nmutual adaptation. The HDC investigates a hierarchical dual learning paradigm\nfor cross-domain semi-supervised segmentation based on the obtained matched\ndomains. It mainly builds two dual-modelling networks for mining the\ncomplementary information in both intra-domain and inter-domain. For the\nintra-domain learning, a consistency constraint is applied to the\ndual-modelling targets to exploit the complementary modelling information. For\nthe inter-domain learning, a consistency constraint is applied to the LAs\nmodelled by two dual-modelling networks to exploit the complementary knowledge\namong different data domains. We demonstrated the performance of our proposed\nAHDC on four 3D late gadolinium enhancement cardiac MR (LGE-CMR) datasets from\ndifferent centres and a 3D CT dataset.

    "abstract": "Objectives: To develop an image-based automatic deep learning method to\nclassify cardiac MR images by sequence type and imaging plane for improved\nclinical post-processing efficiency. Methods: Multi-vendor cardiac MRI studies\nwere retrospectively collected from 4 centres and 3 vendors. A two-head\nconvolutional neural network ('CardiSort') was trained to classify 35 sequences\nby imaging sequence (n=17) and plane (n=10). Single vendor training (SVT) on\nsingle centre images (n=234 patients) and multi-vendor training (MVT) with\nmulticentre images (n = 479 patients, 3 centres) was performed. Model accuracy\nwas compared to manual ground truth labels by an expert radiologist on a\nhold-out test set for both SVT and MVT. External validation of MVT\n(MVTexternal) was performed on data from 3 previously unseen magnet systems\nfrom 2 vendors (n=80 patients). Results: High sequence and plane accuracies\nwere observed for SVT (85.2% and 93.2% respectively), and MVT (96.5% and 98.1%\nrespectively) on the hold-out test set. MVTexternal yielded sequence accuracy\nof 92.7% and plane accuracy of 93.0%. There was high accuracy for common\nsequences and conventional cardiac planes. Poor accuracy was observed for\nunderrepresented classes and sequences where there was greater variability in\nacquisition parameters across centres, such as perfusion imaging. Conclusions:\nA deep learning network was developed on multivendor data to classify MRI\nstudies into component sequences and planes, with external validation. With\nrefinement, it has potential to improve workflow by enabling automated sequence\nselection, an important first step in completely automated post-processing\npipelines.",

    "title": "Predicting the effects of waning vaccine immunity against COVID-19  through high-resolution agent-based modeling",
    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic is yet again on the verge of escalating, despite a\nhopeful case decrease recorded during spring and summer 2021, due to successful\nvaccination roll-outs. Together with the emergence of new variants, the\npotential waning of the vaccination immunity could pose threats to public\nhealth. It is tenable that the timing of such a gradual drop in the immunity of\nmost of the vaccinated population would synchronize with the near-complete\nrestoration of normalcy. Should also testing be relaxed, we might witness a\npotentially disastrous COVID-19 wave in winter 2021/2022. In response to this\nrisk, many countries, including the U.S., are opting for the administration of\na third vaccine dose, the booster shot. Here, in a projected study with an\noutlook of six months, we explore the interplay between the rate at which\nboosters are distributed and the extent to which testing practices are\nimplemented. Projections are based on a highly granular agent-based model that\nprovides a close, one-to-one digital reproduction of a real, medium-sized U.S.\ntown. Focusing on the dominant Delta variant, we contemplate the waning\nimmunity provided by the locally available Johnson&Johnson, Pfizer, and Moderna\nvaccines. Theoretical projections indicate that the administration of boosters\nat the rate at which the vaccine is currently administered could yield a severe\nresurgence of the pandemic, even worse than the first wave experienced in\nspring and summer 2020. Our projections suggest that the peak levels of mid\nspring 2021 in the vaccination rate may prevent the occurrence of such a\nscenario. Our study highlights the importance of testing, especially to detect\ninfection of asymptomatic individuals in the very near future, as the release\nof the booster reaches full speed.",

    "title": "Learning Sparse Graph with Minimax Concave Penalty under Gaussian Markov  Random Fields",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a convex-analytic framework to learn sparse graphs from\ndata. While our problem formulation is inspired by an extension of the\ngraphical lasso using the so-called combinatorial graph Laplacian framework, a\nkey difference is the use of a nonconvex alternative to the $\\ell_1$ norm to\nattain graphs with better interpretability. Specifically, we use the\nweakly-convex minimax concave penalty (the difference between the $\\ell_1$ norm\nand the Huber function) which is known to yield sparse solutions with lower\nestimation bias than $\\ell_1$ for regression problems. In our framework, the\ngraph Laplacian is replaced in the optimization by a linear transform of the\nvector corresponding to its upper triangular part. Via a reformulation relying\non Moreau's decomposition, we show that overall convexity is guaranteed by\nintroducing a quadratic function to our cost function. The problem can be\nsolved efficiently by the primal-dual splitting method, of which the admissible\nconditions for provable convergence are presented. Numerical examples show that\nthe proposed method significantly outperforms the existing graph learning\nmethods with reasonable CPU time.",
