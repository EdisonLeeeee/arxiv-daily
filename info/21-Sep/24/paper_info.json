    "title": "In-network Computation for Large-scale Federated Learning over Wireless  Edge Networks",
    "abstract": "Most conventional Federated Learning (FL) models are using a star network\ntopology where all users aggregate their local models at a single server (e.g.,\na cloud server). That causes significant overhead in terms of both\ncommunications and computing at the server, delaying the training process,\nespecially for large scale FL systems with straggling nodes. This paper\nproposes a novel edge network architecture that enables decentralizing the\nmodel aggregation process at the server, thereby significantly reducing the\ntraining delay for the whole FL network. Specifically, we design a\nhighly-effective in-network computation protocol (INC) consisting of a user\nscheduling mechanism, an in-network aggregation process (INA) which is designed\nfor both primal- and primal-dual methods in distributed machine learning\nproblems, and a network routing algorithm. Under the proposed INA, we then\nformulate a joint routing and resource optimization problem, aiming to minimize\nthe aggregation latency. The problem is NP-hard, and thus we propose a\npolynomial time routing algorithm which can achieve near optimal performance\nwith a theoretical bound. Simulation results showed that the proposed INC\nframework can not only help reduce the FL training latency, up to 5.6 times,\nbut also significantly decrease cloud's traffic and computing overhead. This\ncan enable large-scale FL.",

    "abstract": "A key challenge facing deep learning is that neural networks are often not\nrobust to shifts in the underlying data distribution. We study this problem\nfrom the perspective of the statistical concept of parameter identification.\nGeneralization bounds from learning theory often assume that the test\ndistribution is close to the training distribution. In contrast, if we can\nidentify the \"true\" parameters, then the model generalizes to arbitrary\ndistribution shifts. However, neural networks are typically overparameterized,\nmaking parameter identification impossible. We show that for quadratic neural\nnetworks, we can identify the function represented by the model even though we\ncannot identify its parameters. Thus, we can obtain robust generalization\nbounds even in the overparameterized setting. We leverage this result to obtain\nnew bounds for contextual bandits and transfer learning with quadratic neural\nnetworks. Overall, our results suggest that we can improve robustness of neural\nnetworks by designing models that can represent the true data generating\nprocess. In practice, the true data generating process is often very complex;\nthus, we study how our framework might connect to neural module networks, which\nare designed to break down complex tasks into compositions of simpler ones. We\nprove robust generalization bounds when individual neural modules are\nidentifiable.",

    "abstract": "Spreading processes on graphs arise in a host of application domains, from\nthe study of online social networks to viral marketing to epidemiology. Various\ndiscrete-time probabilistic models for spreading processes have been proposed.\nThese are used for downstream statistical estimation and prediction problems,\noften involving messages or other information that is transmitted along with\ninfections caused by the process. It is thus important to design models of\ncascade observation that take into account phenomena that lead to uncertainty\nabout the process state at any given time. We highlight one such phenomenon --\ntemporal distortion -- caused by a misalignment between the rate at which\nobservations of a cascade process are made and the rate at which the process\nitself operates, and argue that failure to correct for it results in\ndegradation of performance on downstream statistical tasks. To address these\nissues, we formulate the clock estimation problem in terms of a natural\ndistortion measure. We give a clock estimation algorithm, which we call\nFastClock, that runs in linear time in the size of its input and is provably\nstatistically accurate for a broad range of model parameters when cascades are\ngenerated from the independent cascade process with known parameters and when\nthe underlying graph is Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi. We further give empirical results on\nthe performance of our algorithm in comparison to the state of the art\nestimator, a likelihood proxy maximization-based estimator implemented via\ndynamic programming.

We\ncompile two CDS corpora with sentential logical forms, one in English and the\nother in Hebrew. In compiling the corpora we employ a methodology that enforces\na cross-linguistically consistent representation, building on recent advances\nin dependency representation and semantic parsing. The corpora are based on a\nsizable portion of Brown's Adam corpus from CHILDES (about 80% of its\nchild-directed utterances), and to all child-directed utterances from Berman's\nHebrew CHILDES corpus Hagar.\nWe begin by annotating the corpora with the Universal Dependencies (UD)\nscheme for syntactic annotation, motivated by its applicability to a wide\nvariety of domains and languages. We then proceed by applying an automatic\nmethod for transducing sentential logical forms (LFs) from UD structures. The\ntwo representations have complementary strengths: UD structures are\nlanguage-neutral and support direct annotation, whereas LFs are neutral as to\nthe interface between syntax and semantics, and transparently encode semantic\ndistinctions. We verify the quality of the annotated UD annotation using an\ninter-annotator agreement study.

Most existing BO\nmethods exhibit poor performance on search spaces with more than a few dozen\nparameters.

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen growing interest in the diagnosis of Coronary Artery\nDisease (CAD) with machine learning methods to reduce the cost and health\nimplications of conventional diagnosis. This paper introduces a CAD diagnosis\nmethod with a novel feature extraction technique called the Profile-Based\nBinary Feature Extraction (PBBFE). In this method, after partitioning numerical\nfeatures, frequent itemsets are extracted by the Apriori algorithm and then\nused as features to increase the CAD diagnosis accuracy. The proposed method\nconsists of two main phases. In the first phase, each patient is assigned a\nprofile based on age, gender, and medical condition, and then all numerical\nfeatures are discretized based on assigned profiles. All features then undergo\na binarization process to become ready for feature extraction by Apriori. In\nthe last step of this phase, frequent itemsets are extracted from the dataset\nby Apriori and used to build a new dataset. In the second phase, the Genetic\nAlgorithm and the Support Vector Machine are used to identify the best subset\nof extracted features for classification. The proposed method was tested on the\nZ-Alizadeh Sani dataset, which is one the richest databases in the field of\nCAD. Performance comparisons conducted on this dataset showed that the proposed\nmethod outperforms all major alternative methods with 98.35% accuracy, 100%\nsensitivity, and 94.25% specificity.

    "abstract": "Background: Research software is software developed by and/or used by\nresearchers, across a wide variety of domains, to perform their research.\nBecause of the complexity of research software, developers cannot conduct\nexhaustive testing. As a result, researchers have lower confidence in the\ncorrectness of the output of the software. Peer code review, a standard\nsoftware engineering practice, has helped address this problem in other types\nof software. Aims: Peer code review is less prevalent in research software than\nit is in other types of software. In addition, the literature does not contain\nany studies about the use of peer code review in research software. Therefore,\nthrough analyzing developers perceptions, the goal of this work is to\nunderstand the current practice of peer code review in the development of\nresearch software, identify challenges and barriers associated with peer code\nreview in research software, and present approaches to improve the peer code\nreview in research software. Method: We conducted interviews and a community\nsurvey of research software developers to collect information about their\ncurrent peer code review practices, difficulties they face, and how they\naddress those difficulties. Results: We received 84 unique responses from the\ninterviews and surveys. The results show that while research software teams\nreview a large amount of their code, they lack formal process, proper\norganization, and adequate people to perform the reviews. Conclusions: Use of\npeer code review is promising for improving the quality of research software\nand thereby improving the trustworthiness of the underlying research results.\nIn addition, by using peer code review, research software developers produce\nmore readable and understandable code, which will be easier to maintain.",

This problem is formulated as\nan optimization program under a tailored dq-frame, which minimizes the\nnegative-sequence voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC) subject to the\ncurrent, active power, synchronization stability, and feasibility constraints.\nThe program is inherently nonconvex and intractable. So, to guarantee the\noptimality, a rigorous optimality analysis is performed by leveraging\nanalytical optimization. The analysis is divided into two cases: full\nmitigation of VU and partial attenuation of VU. For the former case, we\nanalytically solve the original program since the resultant VU is immediately\ndeducible. For the latter one, directly solving the problem becomes very hard.\nThus, we reformulate the program into an equivalent but more tractable form\nunder certain conditions, by which the analytical optimum can be finally\nderived. It is found that the optimum trajectory has three stages (O1-O3),\ndepending on two critical boundary conditions (C1 and C2). Finally, we\nimplement the optimum with a photovoltaic (PV)-storage system by developing an\nOVUA controller. The proposed approach is demonstrated by dynamic simulations\nunder different VU conditions and is compared with several existing practices.",

Intending to accelerate fact-checking, we bridge this gap by\ngrouping similar messages and summarizing them into aggregated claims.\nSpecifically, we first clean a set of social media posts (e.g., tweets) and\nbuild a graph of all posts based on their semantics; Then, we perform two\nclustering methods to group the messages for further claim summarization. We\nevaluate the summaries both quantitatively with ROUGE scores and qualitatively\nwith human evaluation. We also generate a graph of summaries to verify that\nthere is no significant overlap among them. The results reduced 28,818 original\nmessages to 700 summary claims, showing the potential to speed up the\nfact-checking process by organizing and selecting representative claims from\nmassive disorganized and redundant messages.",

VPR is a fundamental task for autonomous\nnavigation as it enables self-localization within an environment. Although\nrobots are often equipped with resource-constrained hardware, the computational\nrequirements of and effects on VPR techniques have received little attention.\nIn this work, we present a hardware-focused benchmark evaluation of a number of\nstate-of-the-art VPR techniques on public datasets.

Key questions addressed include: (1)\nHow does the performance accuracy of a VPR technique change with processor\narchitecture? (2) How does power consumption vary for different VPR techniques\nand embedded platforms? (3) How much does descriptor size matter in comparison\nto today's embedded platforms' storage? (4) How does the performance of a\nhigh-end platform relate to an on-board low-end embedded platform for VPR?

However,\nit is not feasible to learn and benchmark social navigation behaviors entirely\nin the real world, as learning is data-intensive, and it is challenging to make\nsafety guarantees during training. Therefore, simulation-based benchmarks that\nprovide abstractions for social navigation are required. A framework for these\nbenchmarks would need to support a wide variety of learning approaches, be\nextensible to the broad range of social navigation scenarios, and abstract away\nthe perception problem to focus on social navigation explicitly.

    "abstract": "Many real-life scenarios require humans to make difficult trade-offs: do we\nalways follow all the traffic rules or do we violate the speed limit in an\nemergency? These scenarios force us to evaluate the trade-off between\ncollective norms and our own personal objectives. To create effective AI-human\nteams, we must equip AI agents with a model of how humans make trade-offs in\ncomplex, constrained environments. These agents will be able to mirror human\nbehavior or to draw human attention to situations where decision making could\nbe improved. To this end, we propose a novel inverse reinforcement learning\n(IRL) method for learning implicit hard and soft constraints from\ndemonstrations, enabling agents to quickly adapt to new settings. In addition,\nlearning soft constraints over states, actions, and state features allows\nagents to transfer this knowledge to new domains that share similar aspects. We\nthen use the constraint learning method to implement a novel system\narchitecture that leverages a cognitive model of human decision making,\nmulti-alternative decision field theory (MDFT), to orchestrate competing\nobjectives. We evaluate the resulting agent on trajectory length, number of\nviolated constraints, and total reward, demonstrating that our agent\narchitecture is both general and achieves strong performance. Thus we are able\nto capture and replicate human-like trade-offs from demonstrations in\nenvironments when constraints are not explicit.",

Traditionally, these surrogates have\nbeen trained using datasets which map strain inputs to stress outputs directly.\nData-driven constitutive models for elastic and inelastic materials have\ncommonly been developed based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), which\nrecently enabled the incorporation of physical laws in the construction of\nthese models. However, ANNs do not offer convergence guarantees and are reliant\non user-specified parameters. In contrast to ANNs, Gaussian process regression\n(GPR) is based on nonparametric modeling principles as well as on fundamental\nstatistical knowledge and hence allows for strict convergence guarantees. GPR\nhowever has the major disadvantage that it scales poorly as datasets get large.\nIn this work we present a physics-informed data-driven constitutive modeling\napproach for isostropic and anisotropic materials based on probabilistic\nmachine learning that can be used in the big data context. The trained GPR\nsurrogates are able to respect physical principles such as material frame\nindifference, material symmetry, thermodynamic consistency, stress-free\nundeformed configuration, and the local balance of angular momentum.\nFurthermore, this paper presents the first sampling approach that directly\ngenerates space-filling points in the invariant space corresponding to bounded\ndomain of the gradient deformation tensor. Overall, the presented approach is\ntested on synthetic data from isotropic and anisotropic constitutive laws and\nshows surprising accuracy even far beyond the limits of the training domain,\nindicating that the resulting surrogates can efficiently generalize as they\nincorporate knowledge about the underlying physics.",

The\nCapsule network (CapsNet) was proposed to address these challenges because its\narchitecture can encode and preserve the spatial orientation of input images.\nSimilar to traditional CNNs, CapsNet is also vulnerable to several malicious\nattacks, as studied by several researchers in the literature. However, most of\nthese studies focus on single-device-based inference, but horizontally\ncollaborative inference in state-of-the-art systems, like intelligent edge\nservices in self-driving cars, voice controllable systems, and drones, nullify\nmost of these analyses. Horizontal collaboration implies partitioning the\ntrained CNN models or CNN tasks to multiple end devices or edge nodes.\nTherefore, it is imperative to examine the robustness of the CapsNet against\nmalicious attacks when deployed in horizontally collaborative environments.\nTowards this, we examine the robustness of the CapsNet when subjected to\nnoise-based inference attacks in a horizontal collaborative environment. In\nthis analysis, we perturbed the feature maps of the different layers of four\nDNN models, i.e., CapsNet, Mini-VGG, LeNet, and an in-house designed CNN\n(ConvNet) with the same number of parameters as CapsNet, using two types of\nnoised-based attacks, i.e., Gaussian Noise Attack and FGSM noise attack. The\nexperimental results show that similar to the traditional CNNs, depending upon\nthe access of the attacker to the DNN layer, the classification accuracy of the\nCapsNet drops significantly. For example, when Gaussian Noise Attack\nclassification is performed at the DigitCap layer of the CapsNet, the maximum\nclassification accuracy drop is approximately 97%.",

The research presented in this paper takes a\nstep toward systematizing the sharing of sensitive and restricted research data\nby developing an ontology to frame and guide DSUA (Data Sharing and Usage\nAgreement) development. The paper provides background context, describes the\nontology creation process, and introduces the Data Sharing Agreements for\nRestricted and Sensitive Information (DARSI) ontology.

One exciting application domain for such\ntechnologies is precision agriculture, where the ability to integrate on-board\nmachine vision with data-driven actuation means that farmers can make decisions\nabout crop care and harvesting at the level of the individual plant rather than\nthe whole field. This makes sense both economically and environmentally.\nHowever, the key driver for this capability is fast and robust machine vision\n-- typically driven by machine learning (ML) solutions and dependent on\naccurate modelling. One critical challenge is that the bulk of ML-based vision\nresearch considers only metrics that evaluate the accuracy of object detection\nand do not assess practical factors.

    "abstract": "Research on exploration in reinforcement learning, as applied to Atari 2600\ngame-playing, has emphasized tackling difficult exploration problems such as\nMontezuma's Revenge (Bellemare et al., 2016). Recently, bonus-based exploration\nmethods, which explore by augmenting the environment reward, have reached\nabove-human average performance on such domains. In this paper we reassess\npopular bonus-based exploration methods within a common evaluation framework.\nWe combine Rainbow (Hessel et al., 2018) with different exploration bonuses and\nevaluate its performance on Montezuma's Revenge, Bellemare et al.'s set of hard\nof exploration games with sparse rewards, and the whole Atari 2600 suite. We\nfind that while exploration bonuses lead to higher score on Montezuma's Revenge\nthey do not provide meaningful gains over the simpler $\\epsilon$-greedy scheme.\nIn fact, we find that methods that perform best on that game often underperform\n$\\epsilon$-greedy on easy exploration Atari 2600 games. We find that our\nconclusions remain valid even when hyperparameters are tuned for these\neasy-exploration games. Finally, we find that none of the methods surveyed\nbenefit from additional training samples (1 billion frames, versus Rainbow's\n200 million) on Bellemare et al.'s hard exploration games. Our results suggest\nthat recent gains in Montezuma's Revenge may be better attributed to\narchitecture change, rather than better exploration schemes; and that the real\npace of progress in exploration research for Atari 2600 games may have been\nobfuscated by good results on a single domain.",

    "abstract": "Automated characterization of spatial data is a kind of critical geographical\nintelligence. As an emerging technique for characterization, Spatial\nRepresentation Learning (SRL) uses deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn\nnon-linear embedded features of spatial data for characterization. However, SRL\nextracts features by internal layers of DNNs, and thus suffers from lacking\nsemantic labels. Texts of spatial entities, on the other hand, provide semantic\nunderstanding of latent feature labels, but is insensible to deep SRL models.\nHow can we teach a SRL model to discover appropriate topic labels in texts and\npair learned features with the labels? This paper formulates a new problem:\nfeature-topic pairing, and proposes a novel Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)\nbased deep learning framework. Specifically, we formulate the feature-topic\npairing problem into an automated alignment task between 1) a latent embedding\nfeature space and 2) a textual semantic topic space. We decompose the alignment\nof the two spaces into: 1) point-wise alignment, denoting the correlation\nbetween a topic distribution and an embedding vector; 2) pair-wise alignment,\ndenoting the consistency between a feature-feature similarity matrix and a\ntopic-topic similarity matrix. We design a PSO based solver to simultaneously\nselect an optimal set of topics and learn corresponding features based on the\nselected topics. We develop a closed loop algorithm to iterate between 1)\nminimizing losses of representation reconstruction and feature-topic alignment\nand 2) searching the best topics. Finally, we present extensive experiments to\ndemonstrate the enhanced performance of our method.",

Our framework leverages nonlinear model predictive\ncontrol (NMPC) to formulate a constrained image-based visual servoing (IBVS)\nproblem. The quadrotor dynamics, image dynamics, actuation constraints, and\nvisibility constraints are taken into account to handle quadrotor maneuvers\nwith high agility. Two main challenges of applying IBVS to agile drones are\nconsidered: (i) high sensitivity of depths to intense orientation changes, and\n(ii) conflict between the visual servoing objective and action objective due to\nthe underactuated nature. To deal with the first challenge, we parameterize a\nvisual feature by a bearing vector and a distance, by which the depth will no\nlonger be involved in the image dynamics. Meanwhile, we settle the conflict\nproblem by compensating for the rotation in the future visual servoing cost\nusing the predicted orientations of the quadrotor. Our approach in simulation\nshows that (i) it can work without any position information, (ii) it can\nachieve a maximum referebce speed of 9 m/s in trajectory tracking without\nlosing the target, and (iii) it can reach a landmark, e.g., a gate in drone\nracing, from varied initial configurations.",

    "abstract": "Automatic dialog systems have become a mainstream part of online customer\nservice. Many such systems are built, maintained, and improved by customer\nservice specialists, rather than dialog systems engineers and computer\nprogrammers. As conversations between people and machines become commonplace,\nit is critical to understand what is working, what is not, and what actions can\nbe taken to reduce the frequency of inappropriate system responses. These\nanalyses and recommendations need to be presented in terms that directly\nreflect the user experience rather than the internal dialog processing.\nThis paper introduces and explains the use of Actionable Conversational\nQuality Indicators (ACQIs), which are used both to recognize parts of dialogs\nthat can be improved, and to recommend how to improve them. This combines\nbenefits of previous approaches, some of which have focused on producing dialog\nquality scoring while others have sought to categorize the types of errors the\ndialog system is making.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of using ACQIs on LivePerson internal dialog\nsystems used in commercial customer service applications, and on the publicly\navailable CMU LEGOv2 conversational dataset (Raux et al. 2005). We report on\nthe annotation and analysis of conversational datasets showing which ACQIs are\nimportant to fix in various situations.\nThe annotated datasets are then used to build a predictive model which uses a\nturn-based vector embedding of the message texts and achieves an 79% weighted\naverage f1-measure at the task of finding the correct ACQI for a given\nconversation. We predict that if such a model worked perfectly, the range of\npotential improvement actions a bot-builder must consider at each turn could be\nreduced by an average of 81%.",

This paper presents a\ntwo-step machine learning approach that analyzes low-fidelity and high-fidelity\nimages in sequence, preserving efficiency as well as accuracy. Two\ndata-generators are also used to minimize class imbalance in the high-fidelity\ndataset and to produce low-fidelity data that is representative of UAV images.\nThe analysis of applications and methods is conducted on a database of\nhigh-fidelity apple tree images which are corrupted with class imbalance.

A machine-learning identifier identifies plants\nand labels them as potentially diseased or not. A machine learning classifier\nis then given the potentially diseased plant images and returns actual\ndiagnoses for these plants. The results show an accuracy of 96.3% for the\nhigh-fidelity system and a 75.5% confidence level for our low-fidelity system.\nOur drone technology shows promising results in accuracy when compared to\nlabor-based methods of diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Segmentation of ultra-high resolution images with deep learning is\nchallenging because of their enormous size, often millions or even billions of\npixels. Typical solutions drastically downsample the image uniformly to meet\nmemory constraints, implicitly assuming all pixels equally important by\nsampling at the same density at all spatial locations. However this assumption\nis not true and compromises the performance of deep learning techniques that\nhave proved powerful on standard-sized images. For example with uniform\ndownsampling, see green boxed region in Fig.1, the rider and bike do not have\nenough corresponding samples while the trees and buildings are oversampled, and\nlead to a negative effect on the segmentation prediction from the\nlow-resolution downsampled image. In this work we show that learning the\nspatially varying downsampling strategy jointly with segmentation offers\nadvantages in segmenting large images with limited computational budget. Fig.1\nshows that our method adapts the sampling density over different locations so\nthat more samples are collected from the small important regions and less from\nthe others, which in turn leads to better segmentation accuracy. We show on two\npublic and one local high-resolution datasets that our method consistently\nlearns sampling locations preserving more information and boosting segmentation\naccuracy over baseline methods.",

By not being able to see a\nstudent's face clearly, the teacher may not notice when the student needs\nassistance, or when the student is not paying attention. In order to help\nremedy the teachers of this challenge, this project proposes a machine learning\nbased approach that provides real-time student mental state monitoring and\nclassifications for the teachers to better conduct remote teaching. Using\npublicly available electroencephalogram (EEG) data collections, this research\nexplored four different classification techniques: the classic deep neural\nnetwork, the traditionally popular support vector machine, the latest\nconvolutional neural network, and the XGBoost model, which has gained\npopularity recently. This study defined three mental classes: an engaged\nlearning mode, a confused learning mode, and a relaxed mode. The experimental\nresults from this project showed that these selected classifiers have varying\npotentials in classifying EEG signals for mental states. While some of the\nselected classifiers only yield around 50% accuracy with some delay, the best\nones can achieve 80% accurate classification in real-time. This could be very\nbeneficial for teachers in need of help making remote teaching adjustments, and\nfor many other potential applications where in-person interactions are not\npossible.",

    "abstract": "Dense disparities among multiple views is essential for estimating the 3D\narchitecture of a scene based on the geometrical relationship among the scene\nand the views or cameras. Scenes with larger extents of heterogeneous textures,\ndiffering scene illumination among the multiple views and with occluding\nobjects affect the accuracy of the estimated disparities. Markov random fields\n(MRF) based methods for disparity estimation address these limitations using\nspatial dependencies among the observations and among the disparity estimates.\nThese methods, however, are limited by spatially fixed and smaller neighborhood\nsystems or cliques. In this work, we present a new factor graph-based\nprobabilistic graphical model for disparity estimation that allows a larger and\na spatially variable neighborhood structure determined based on the local scene\ncharacteristics. We evaluated our method using the Middlebury benchmark stereo\ndatasets and the Middlebury evaluation dataset version 3.0 and compared its\nperformance with recent state-of-the-art disparity estimation algorithms. The\nnew factor graph-based method provided disparity estimates with higher accuracy\nwhen compared to the recent non-learning- and learning-based disparity\nestimation algorithms. In addition to disparity estimation, our factor graph\nformulation can be useful for obtaining maximum a posteriori solution to\noptimization problems with complex and variable dependency structures as well\nas for other dense estimation problems such as optical flow estimation.",

The\nretrieval step is especially difficult as typical evidence corpora have\n\\textit{millions} of documents, each of which may or may not have the correct\nanswer to the question. Very recently, dense models have replaced sparse\nmethods as the de facto retrieval method. Rather than focusing on lexical\noverlap to determine similarity, dense methods build an encoding function that\ncaptures semantic similarity by learning from a small collection of\nquestion-answer or question-context pairs. In this paper, we investigate dense\nretrieval models in the context of open-domain question answering across\ndifferent input distributions. To do this, first we introduce an entity-rich\nquestion answering dataset constructed from Wikidata facts and demonstrate\ndense models are unable to generalize to unseen input question distributions.\nSecond, we perform analyses aimed at better understanding the source of the\nproblem and propose new training techniques to improve out-of-domain\nperformance on a wide variety of datasets.

    "abstract": "Refactoring is widely recognized as one of the efficient techniques to manage\ntechnical debt and maintain a healthy software project through enforcing best\ndesign practices or coping with design defects. Previous refactoring surveys\nhave shown that code refactoring activities are mainly executed by developers\nwho have sufficient knowledge of the system's design and disposing of\nleadership roles in their development teams. However, these surveys were mainly\nlimited to specific projects and companies. In this paper, we explore the\ngeneralizability of the previous results by analyzing 800 open-source projects.\nWe mine their refactoring activities, and we identify their corresponding\ncontributors. Then, we associate an experience score to each contributor in\norder to test various hypotheses related to whether developers with higher\nscores tend to 1) perform a higher number of refactoring operations 2) exhibit\ndifferent motivations behind their refactoring, and 3) better document their\nrefactoring activity. We found that (1) although refactoring is not restricted\nto a subset of developers, those with higher contribution scores tend to\nperform more refactorings than others; (2) while there is no correlation\nbetween experience and motivation behind refactoring, top contributed\ndevelopers are found to perform a wider variety of refactoring operations,\nregardless of their complexity; and (3) top contributed developer tend to\ndocument less their refactoring activity.

Hand movement recognition is widely\nused to enable this interaction. Hand configuration classification and\nMetacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint angle detection are important for a\ncomprehensive reconstruction of the hand motion. Surface electromyography and\nother technologies have been used for the detection of hand motions. Ultrasound\nimages of the forearm offer a way to visualize the internal physiology of the\nhand from a musculoskeletal perspective. Recent work has shown that these\nimages can be classified using machine learning to predict various hand\nconfigurations. In this paper, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\nbased deep learning pipeline for predicting the MCP joint angles.

Ultrasound data from the forearm was obtained\nfrom 6 subjects who were instructed to move their hands according to predefined\nhand configurations relevant to ADLs. Motion capture data was acquired as the\nground truth for hand movements at different speeds (0.5 Hz, 1 Hz, & 2 Hz) for\nthe index, middle, ring, and pinky fingers. We were able to get promising SVC\nclassification results on a subset of our collected data set. We demonstrated a\ncorrespondence between the predicted MCP joint angles and the actual MCP joint\nangles for the fingers, with an average root mean square error of 7.35 degrees.\nWe implemented a low latency (6.25 - 9.1 Hz) pipeline for the prediction of\nboth MCP joint angles and hand configuration estimation aimed at real-time\ncontrol of digital devices, AR/VR interfaces, and physical robots.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents development of an optimal feedback linearization control\n(OFLC) for interior permanent magnet (PM) synchronous machines operating in a\nnon steady-sate operating point, i.e., varying torque and speed, to achieve\nprecision tracking performance and energy saving by minimizing the copper loss.\nAn isomorphism mapping between the dq-axes phase voltages and two auxiliary\ncontrol inputs over full ranges of torque and speed is established by the\nlinearization controller using the notion of orthogonal projection. The\nauxiliary control inputs are defined to be exclusively responsible for torque\ngeneration and power consumption. Subsequently, an analytical solution for the\noptimal-linearization control is derived in a closed-form by applying the\nHamiltonian of optimal control theory in conjunction with the Pontryagin's\nminimum principle. The optimal controller takes the maximum voltage limit and\ntorque tracking constraint into account while maximizing machine efficiency for\nnon-constant operational load torque and speed. Unlike the convectional\nquadratic regulator-based control of electric motors, the proposed control\napproach does not rely on steady-state operation conditions and hence it is\nsuitable for such applications as electric vehicles and robotics.",

The ability to successfully evade unseen models\nrepresents an uncomfortable level of ease toward implementing attacks. In this\nwork we note that as studied, current transfer attack research has an\nunrealistic advantage for the attacker: the attacker has the exact same\ntraining data as the victim. We present the first study of transferring\nadversarial attacks focusing on the data available to attacker and victim under\nimperfect settings without querying the victim, where there is some variable\nlevel of overlap in the exact data used or in the classes learned by each\nmodel. This threat model is relevant to applications in medicine, malware, and\nothers. Under this new threat model attack success rate is not correlated with\ndata or class overlap in the way one would expect, and varies with dataset.\nThis makes it difficult for attacker and defender to reason about each other\nand contributes to the broader study of model robustness and security.

    "abstract": "A streaming algorithm is considered to be adversarially robust if it provides\ncorrect outputs with high probability even when the stream updates are chosen\nby an adversary who may observe and react to the past outputs of the algorithm.\nWe grow the burgeoning body of work on such algorithms in a new direction by\nstudying robust algorithms for the problem of maintaining a valid vertex\ncoloring of an $n$-vertex graph given as a stream of edges. Following standard\npractice, we focus on graphs with maximum degree at most $\\Delta$ and aim for\ncolorings using a small number $f(\\Delta)$ of colors.\nA recent breakthrough (Assadi, Chen, and Khanna; SODA~2019) shows that in the\nstandard, non-robust, streaming setting, $(\\Delta+1)$-colorings can be obtained\nwhile using only $\\widetilde{O}(n)$ space. Here, we prove that an adversarially\nrobust algorithm running under a similar space bound must spend almost\n$\\Omega(\\Delta^2)$ colors and that robust $O(\\Delta)$-coloring requires a\nlinear amount of space, namely $\\Omega(n\\Delta)$. We in fact obtain a more\ngeneral lower bound, trading off the space usage against the number of colors\nused. From a complexity-theoretic standpoint, these lower bounds provide\n(i)~the first significant separation between adversarially robust algorithms\nand ordinary randomized algorithms for a natural problem on insertion-only\nstreams and (ii)~the first significant separation between randomized and\ndeterministic coloring algorithms for graph streams, since deterministic\nstreaming algorithms are automatically robust.\nWe complement our lower bounds with a suite of positive results, giving\nadversarially robust coloring algorithms using sublinear space.

In this work, we develop a\nneural network based abstractive multi-document summarization (MDS) model which\nleverages dependency parsing to capture cross-positional dependencies and\ngrammatical structures. More concretely, we process the dependency information\ninto the linguistic-guided attention mechanism and further fuse it with the\nmulti-head attention for better feature representation. With the help of\nlinguistic signals, sentence-level relations can be correctly captured, thus\nimproving MDS performance. Our model has two versions based on Flat-Transformer\nand Hierarchical Transformer respectively. Empirical studies on both versions\ndemonstrate that this simple but effective method outperforms existing works on\nthe benchmark dataset.

Nowadays, the majority of such methods rely on a set of\nspecialized models, each trained for a particular audit task. At the same time,\nwhen conducting a financial statement audit, audit teams are confronted with\n(i) challenging time-budget constraints, (ii) extensive documentation\nobligations, and (iii) strict model interpretability requirements.

    "abstract": "We revisit a classical crossword filling puzzle which already appeared in\nGarey\\&Jonhson's book. We are given a grid with $n$ vertical and horizontal\nslots and a dictionary with $m$ words and are asked to place words from the\ndictionary in the slots so that shared cells are consistent. We attempt to\npinpoint the source of intractability of this problem by taking into account\nthe structure of the grid graph, which contains a vertex for each slot and an\nedge if two slots intersect. Our main approach is to consider the case where\nthis graph has a tree-like structure. Unfortunately, if we impose the common\nrule that words cannot be reused, we show that the problem remains NP-hard even\nunder very severe structural restrictions. The problem becomes slightly more\ntractable if word reuse is allowed, as we obtain an $m^{tw}$ algorithm in this\ncase, where $tw$ is the treewidth of the grid graph. However, even in this\ncase, we show that our algorithm cannot be improved. More strongly, we show\nthat under the ETH the problem cannot be solved in time $m^{o(k)}$, where $k$\nis the number of horizontal slots of the instance.\nMotivated by these mostly negative results, we consider the much more\nrestricted case where the problem is parameterized by the number of slots $n$.\nHere, we show that the problem becomes FPT, but the parameter dependence is\nexponential in $n^2$. We show that this dependence is also justified: the\nexistence of an algorithm with running time $2^{o(n^2)}$ would contradict the\nrandomized ETH. Finally, we consider an optimization version of the problem,\nwhere we seek to place as many words on the grid as possible. Here it is easy\nto obtain a $\\frac{1}{2}$-approximation, even on weighted instances. We show\nthat this algorithm is also likely to be optimal, as obtaining a better\napproximation ratio in polynomial time would contradict the Unique Games\nConjecture.",

    "abstract": "Dense vertex-to-vertex correspondence between 3D faces is a fundamental and\nchallenging issue for 3D&2D face analysis. While the sparse landmarks have\nanatomically ground-truth correspondence, the dense vertex correspondences on\nmost facial regions are unknown. In this view, the current literatures commonly\nresult in reasonable but diverse solutions, which deviate from the optimum to\nthe 3D face dense registration problem. In this paper, we revisit dense\nregistration by a dimension-degraded problem, i.e. proportional segmentation of\na line, and employ an iterative dividing and diffusing method to reach the\nfinal solution uniquely. This method is then extended to 3D surface by\nformulating a local registration problem for dividing and a linear least-square\nproblem for diffusing, with constraints on fixed features. On this basis, we\nfurther propose a multi-resolution algorithm to accelerate the computational\nprocess. The proposed method is linked to a novel local scaling metric, where\nwe illustrate the physical meaning as smooth rearrangement for local cells of\n3D facial shapes. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method in various aspects. Generally, the\nproposed method leads to coherent local registrations and elegant mesh grid\nroutines for fine-grained 3D face dense registrations, which benefits many\ndownstream applications significantly. It can also be applied to dense\ncorrespondence for other format of data which are not limited to face.

Recent advances in computation have\nrendered previously computationally infeasible analyses readily executable on\ncommon computer hardware.

This necessitates the adoption of reduced-order modelling\nmethods, which can reduce the computational toll of such nonlinear analyses. In\nthis work, we propose a reduction scheme relying on the exploitation of an\nautoencoder as means to infer a latent space from output-only response data.\nThis latent space, which in essence approximates the system's nonlinear normal\nmodes (NNMs), serves as an invertible reduction basis for the nonlinear system.\nThe proposed machine learning framework is then complemented via the use of\nlong short term memory (LSTM) networks in the reduced space.

    "abstract": "Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are one of several solutions that\nmake up a computer security system. They are responsible for inspecting network\ntraffic and triggering alerts when detecting intrusion attempts. One of the\nmost popular approaches in NIDS research today is the Anomaly-based technique,\ncharacterized by the ability to recognize previously unobserved attacks. Some\nA-NIDS systems go beyond the separation into normal and anomalous classes by\ntrying to identify the type of detected anomalies. This is an important\ncapability of a security system, as it allows a more effective response to an\nintrusion attempt. The existing systems with this ability are often subject to\nlimitations such as high complexity and incorrect labeling of unknown attacks.\nIn this work, we propose an algorithm to be used in NIDS that overcomes these\nlimitations. Our proposal is an adaptation of the Anomaly-based classifier EFC\nto perform multi-class classification. It has a single layer, with low temporal\ncomplexity, and can correctly classify not only the known attacks, but also\nunprecedented attacks. Our proposal was evaluated in two up-to-date flow-based\nintrusion detection datasets: CIDDS-001 and CICIDS2017. We also conducted a\nspecific experiment to assess our classifier's ability to correctly label\nunknown attacks. Our results show that the multi-class EFC is a promising\nclassifier to be used in NIDS.",

    "abstract": "Strawberries are widely appreciated for their aroma, bright red color, juicy\ntexture, and sweetness. They are, however, among the most sensitive fruits when\nit comes to the quality of the end product. The recent commercial trends show a\nrising number of farmers who directly sell their products and are interested in\nusing smart solutions for a continuous quality control of the product.\nCloud-based approaches for smart irrigation have been widely used in the recent\nyears. However, the network traffic, security and regulatory challenges, which\ncome hand in hand with sharing the crop data with third parties outside the\nedge of the network, lead strawberry farmers and data owners to rely on global\nclouds and potentially lose control over their data, which are usually\ntransferred to third party data centers. In this paper, we follow a three-step\nmethodological approach in order to design, implement and validate a solution\nfor smart strawberry irrigation in greenhouses, while keeping the corresponding\ndata at the edge of the network: (i) We develop a small-scale smart irrigation\nprototype solution with off-the-shelf hardware and software equipment, which we\ntest and evaluate on different kinds of plants in order to gain useful insights\nfor larger scale deployments, (ii) we introduce a reference network\narchitecture, specifically targeting smart irrigation and edge data\ndistribution for strawberry greenhouses, and (iii) adopting the proposed\nreference architecture, we implement a full-scale system in an actual\nstrawberry greenhouse environment in Greece, and we compare its performance\nagainst that of conventional strawberries irrigation. We show that our design\nsignificantly outperforms the conventional approach, both in terms of soil\nmoisture variation and in terms of water consumption, and conclude by\ncritically appraising the costs and benefits of our approach in the\nagricultural industry.",

However,\nit is very difficult to develop context-aware recommender systems that consider\nthese factors, both because of the difficulty of detecting some of them, such\nas emotional state, and because of the drawbacks derived from the inclusion of\nmany factors, such as sparsity problems in contextual pre-filtering. This work\ninvolves the proposal of a method for the detection of the user contextual\nstate when listening to music based on the social tags of music items. The\nintrinsic characteristics of social tagging that allow for the description of\nitems in multiple dimensions can be exploited to capture many contextual\ndimensions in the user listening sessions. The embeddings of the tags of the\nfirst items played in each session are used to represent the context of that\nsession.

Varieties of information, consisting of character appearance,\nbehaviors, facial emotions, dialogues, background music as well as subtitles\ncontribute differently to the final results, which makes the task more\nchallenging but meaningful in developing more advanced multi-modal models.

A major challenge in the burgeoning area of phylogenetic\nnetworks is to develop algorithms for building such networks by amalgamating\nsmall networks into a single large network. The level of a phylogenetic network\nis a measure of its deviation from being a tree; the higher the level of\nnetwork, the less treelike it becomes.

    "abstract": "Distributed computing enables large-scale computation tasks to be processed\nover multiple workers in parallel. However, the randomness of communication and\ncomputation delays across workers causes the straggler effect, which may\ndegrade the performance. Coded computation helps to mitigate the straggler\neffect, but the amount of redundant load and their assignment to the workers\nshould be carefully optimized. In this work, we consider a multi-master\nheterogeneous-worker distributed computing scenario, where multiple matrix\nmultiplication tasks are encoded and allocated to workers for parallel\ncomputation. The goal is to minimize the communication plus computation delay\nof the slowest task. We propose worker assignment, resource allocation and load\nallocation algorithms under both dedicated and fractional worker assignment\npolicies, where each worker can process the encoded tasks of either a single\nmaster or multiple masters, respectively. Then, the non-convex delay\nminimization problem is solved by employing the Markov's inequality-based\napproximation, Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, and successive convex\napproximation methods. Through extensive simulations, we show that the proposed\nalgorithms can reduce the task completion delay compared to the benchmarks, and\nobserve that dedicated and fractional worker assignment policies have different\nscopes of applications.",

    "abstract": "Neural network implementations are known to be vulnerable to physical attack\nvectors such as fault injection attacks. As of now, these attacks were only\nutilized during the inference phase with the intention to cause a\nmisclassification. In this work, we explore a novel attack paradigm by\ninjecting faults during the training phase of a neural network in a way that\nthe resulting network can be attacked during deployment without the necessity\nof further faulting. In particular, we discuss attacks against ReLU activation\nfunctions that make it possible to generate a family of malicious inputs, which\nare called fooling inputs, to be used at inference time to induce controlled\nmisclassifications. Such malicious inputs are obtained by mathematically\nsolving a system of linear equations that would cause a particular behaviour on\nthe attacked activation functions, similar to the one induced in training\nthrough faulting. We call such attacks fooling backdoors as the fault attacks\nat the training phase inject backdoors into the network that allow an attacker\nto produce fooling inputs. We evaluate our approach against multi-layer\nperceptron networks and convolutional networks on a popular image\nclassification task obtaining high attack success rates (from 60% to 100%) and\nhigh classification confidence when as little as 25 neurons are attacked while\npreserving high accuracy on the originally intended classification task.",

    "abstract": "Trust region methods rigorously enabled reinforcement learning (RL) agents to\nlearn monotonically improving policies, leading to superior performance on a\nvariety of tasks. Unfortunately, when it comes to multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (MARL), the property of monotonic improvement may not simply apply;\nthis is because agents, even in cooperative games, could have conflicting\ndirections of policy updates. As a result, achieving a guaranteed improvement\non the joint policy where each agent acts individually remains an open\nchallenge. In this paper, we extend the theory of trust region learning to\nMARL. Central to our findings are the multi-agent advantage decomposition lemma\nand the sequential policy update scheme. Based on these, we develop\nHeterogeneous-Agent Trust Region Policy Optimisation (HATPRO) and\nHeterogeneous-Agent Proximal Policy Optimisation (HAPPO) algorithms. Unlike\nmany existing MARL algorithms, HATRPO/HAPPO do not need agents to share\nparameters, nor do they need any restrictive assumptions on decomposibility of\nthe joint value function. Most importantly, we justify in theory the monotonic\nimprovement property of HATRPO/HAPPO. We evaluate the proposed methods on a\nseries of Multi-Agent MuJoCo and StarCraftII tasks. Results show that HATRPO\nand HAPPO significantly outperform strong baselines such as IPPO, MAPPO and\nMADDPG on all tested tasks, therefore establishing a new state of the art.",

This hinders QA models from generalizing to under-represented\nsamples such as questions with low lexical overlap.

To achieve this goal, high performance, but unverified controllers (e.g.\ndeep neural network, black-box controllers from third parties) are applied,\nwhich makes it very challenging to keep the overall CPS safe. By sandboxing\nthese controllers, we are not only able to use them but also to enforce safety\nproperties over the controlled physical systems at the same time. However,\ncurrent available solutions for sandboxing controllers are just applicable to\ndeterministic (a.k.a. non-stochastic) systems, possibly affected by bounded\ndisturbances. In this paper, for the first time we propose a novel solution for\nsandboxing unverified complex controllers for CPS operating in noisy\nenvironments (a.k.a. stochastic CPS). Moreover, we also provide probabilistic\nguarantees on their safety. Here, the unverified control input is observed at\neach time instant and checked whether it violates the maximal tolerable\nprobability of reaching the unsafe set. If this probability exceeds a given\nthreshold, the unverified control input will be rejected, and the advisory\ninput provided by the optimal safety controller will be used to maintain the\nprobabilistic safety guarantee.

Existing methods often address this\ntask in an indirect way, by casting it as a proposal-and-match or\nfusion-and-detection problem. Solving these surrogate problems often requires\nsophisticated label assignment during training and hand-crafted removal of\nnear-duplicate results. Meanwhile, existing works typically focus on sparse\nvideo grounding with a single sentence as input, which could result in\nambiguous localization due to its unclear description. In this paper, we tackle\na new problem of dense video grounding, by simultaneously localizing multiple\nmoments with a paragraph as input. From a perspective on video grounding as\nlanguage conditioned regression, we present an end-to-end parallel decoding\nparadigm by re-purposing a Transformer-alike architecture (PRVG). The key\ndesign in our PRVG is to use languages as queries, and directly regress the\nmoment boundaries based on language-modulated visual representations. Thanks to\nits simplicity in design, our PRVG framework can be applied in different\ntesting schemes (sparse or dense grounding) and allows for efficient inference\nwithout any post-processing technique. In addition, we devise a robust\nproposal-level attention loss to guide the training of PRVG, which is invariant\nto moment duration and contributes to model convergence. We perform experiments\non two video grounding benchmarks of ActivityNet Captions and TACoS,\ndemonstrating that our PRVG can significantly outperform previous methods.

In this paper we present ChainBot, an approach for creating\nalgorithmic trading bots with the help of blockchain technology.

Our system is enabled with a careful use of algorithm\npartitioning, zero-knowledge proofs and smart contracts. We also show that with\nlayer-2 (L2) technologies, trades can be kept private, which means that\nalgorithmic parameters are difficult to recover by a chain observer. Our\napproach offers more transparent access to liquidity and better\ncensorship-resistance compared to traditional off-chain trading approaches. We\ndevelop a sample ChainBot and train it on historical data, resulting in returns\nthat are up to 2.4x the buy-and-hold strategy, which we use as our baseline.\nOur measurements show that across 1000 runs, the end-to-end average execution\ntime for our system is 48.4 seconds.

    "abstract": "This paper considers binary and multilabel classification problems in a\nsetting where labels are missing independently and with a known rate. Missing\nlabels are a ubiquitous phenomenon in extreme multi-label classification (XMC)\ntasks, such as matching Wikipedia articles to a small subset out of the\nhundreds of thousands of possible tags, where no human annotator can possibly\ncheck the validity of all the negative samples. For this reason,\npropensity-scored precision -- an unbiased estimate for precision-at-k under a\nknown noise model -- has become one of the standard metrics in XMC. Few methods\ntake this problem into account already during the training phase, and all are\nlimited to loss functions that can be decomposed into a sum of contributions\nfrom each individual label. A typical approach to training is to reduce the\nmultilabel problem into a series of binary or multiclass problems, and it has\nbeen shown that if the surrogate task should be consistent for optimizing\nrecall, the resulting loss function is not decomposable over labels. Therefore,\nthis paper derives the unique unbiased estimators for the different multilabel\nreductions, including the non-decomposable ones. These estimators suffer from\nincreased variance and may lead to ill-posed optimization problems, which we\naddress by switching to convex upper-bounds. The theoretical considerations are\nfurther supplemented by an experimental study showing that the switch to\nunbiased estimators significantly alters the bias-variance trade-off and may\nthus require stronger regularization, which in some cases can negate the\nbenefits of unbiased estimation.",

    "abstract": "Intelligent navigation among social crowds is an essential aspect of mobile\nrobotics for applications such as delivery, health care, or assistance. Deep\nReinforcement Learning emerged as an alternative planning method to\nconservative approaches and promises more efficient and flexible navigation.\nHowever, in highly dynamic environments employing different kinds of obstacle\nclasses, safe navigation still presents a grand challenge. In this paper, we\npropose a semantic Deep-reinforcement-learning-based navigation approach that\nteaches object-specific safety rules by considering high-level obstacle\ninformation. In particular, the agent learns object-specific behavior by\ncontemplating the specific danger zones to enhance safety around vulnerable\nobject classes. We tested the approach against a benchmark obstacle avoidance\napproach and found an increase in safety. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the\nagent could learn to navigate more safely by keeping an individual safety\ndistance dependent on the semantic information.",

To\nfacilitate the research, we introduce CI-ToD, a novel dataset for Consistency\nIdentification in Task-oriented Dialog system. In addition, we not only\nannotate the single label to enable the model to judge whether the system\nresponse is contradictory, but also provide more fine-grained labels (i.e.,\nDialogue History Inconsistency, User Query Inconsistency and Knowledge Base\nInconsistency) to encourage model to know what inconsistent sources lead to it.\nEmpirical results show that state-of-the-art methods only achieve 51.3%, which\nis far behind the human performance of 93.2%, indicating that there is ample\nroom for improving consistency identification ability.

    "abstract": "Pool-based active learning (AL) aims to optimize the annotation process\n(i.e., labeling) as the acquisition of annotations is often time-consuming and\ntherefore expensive. For this purpose, an AL strategy queries annotations\nintelligently from annotators to train a high-performance classification model\nat a low annotation cost. Traditional AL strategies operate in an idealized\nframework. They assume a single, omniscient annotator who never gets tired and\ncharges uniformly regardless of query difficulty. However, in real-world\napplications, we often face human annotators, e.g., crowd or in-house workers,\nwho make annotation mistakes and can be reluctant to respond if tired or faced\nwith complex queries. Recently, a wide range of novel AL strategies has been\nproposed to address these issues. They differ in at least one of the following\nthree central aspects from traditional AL: (1) They explicitly consider\n(multiple) human annotators whose performances can be affected by various\nfactors, such as missing expertise. (2) They generalize the interaction with\nhuman annotators by considering different query and annotation types, such as\nasking an annotator for feedback on an inferred classification rule. (3) They\ntake more complex cost schemes regarding annotations and misclassifications\ninto account. This survey provides an overview of these AL strategies and\nrefers to them as real-world AL. Therefore, we introduce a general real-world\nAL strategy as part of a learning cycle and use its elements, e.g., the query\nand annotator selection algorithm, to categorize about 60 real-world AL\nstrategies. Finally, we outline possible directions for future research in the\nfield of AL.",

    "abstract": "Real-world object detection is highly desired to be equipped with the\nlearning expandability that can enlarge its detection classes incrementally.\nMoreover, such learning from only few annotated training samples further adds\nthe flexibility for the object detector, which is highly expected in many\napplications such as autonomous driving, robotics, etc. However, such\nsequential learning scenario with few-shot training samples generally causes\ncatastrophic forgetting and dramatic overfitting. In this paper, to address the\nabove incremental few-shot learning issues, a novel Incremental Few-Shot Object\nDetection (iFSOD) method is proposed to enable the effective continual learning\nfrom few-shot samples. Specifically, a Double-Branch Framework (DBF) is\nproposed to decouple the feature representation of base and novel (few-shot)\nclass, which facilitates both the old-knowledge retention and new-class\nadaption simultaneously. Furthermore, a progressive model updating rule is\ncarried out to preserve the long-term memory on old classes effectively when\nadapt to sequential new classes. Moreover, an inter-task class separation loss\nis proposed to extend the decision region of new-coming classes for better\nfeature discrimination.

    "title": "Orthogonal Graph Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have received tremendous attention due to their\nsuperiority in learning node representations. These models rely on message\npassing and feature transformation functions to encode the structural and\nfeature information from neighbors. However, stacking more convolutional layers\nsignificantly decreases the performance of GNNs. Most recent studies attribute\nthis limitation to the over-smoothing issue, where node embeddings converge to\nindistinguishable vectors. Through a number of experimental observations, we\nargue that the main factor degrading the performance is the unstable forward\nnormalization and backward gradient resulted from the improper design of the\nfeature transformation, especially for shallow GNNs where the over-smoothing\nhas not happened. Therefore, we propose a novel orthogonal feature\ntransformation, named Ortho-GConv, which could generally augment the existing\nGNN backbones to stabilize the model training and improve the model's\ngeneralization performance. Specifically, we maintain the orthogonality of the\nfeature transformation comprehensively from three perspectives, namely hybrid\nweight initialization, orthogonal transformation, and orthogonal\nregularization. By equipping the existing GNNs (e.g. GCN, JKNet, GCNII) with\nOrtho-GConv, we demonstrate the generality of the orthogonal feature\ntransformation to enable stable training, and show its effectiveness for node\nand graph classification tasks.",

    "abstract": "Anti-malware agents typically communicate with their remote services to share\ninformation about suspicious files. These remote services use their up-to-date\ninformation and global context (view) to help classify the files and instruct\ntheir agents to take a predetermined action (e.g., delete or quarantine). In\nthis study, we provide a security analysis of a specific form of communication\nbetween anti-malware agents and their services, which takes place entirely over\nthe insecure DNS protocol. These services, which we denote DNS anti-malware\nlist (DNSAML) services, affect the classification of files scanned by\nanti-malware agents, therefore potentially putting their consumers at risk due\nto known integrity and confidentiality flaws of the DNS protocol. By analyzing\na large-scale DNS traffic dataset made available to the authors by a well-known\nCDN provider, we identify anti-malware solutions that seem to make use of\nDNSAML services. We found that these solutions, deployed on almost three\nmillion machines worldwide, exchange hundreds of millions of DNS requests\ndaily. These requests are carrying sensitive file scan information, oftentimes\n- as we demonstrate - without any additional safeguards to compensate for the\ninsecurities of the DNS protocol. As a result, these anti-malware solutions\nthat use DNSAML are made vulnerable to DNS attacks. For instance, an attacker\ncapable of tampering with DNS queries, gains the ability to alter the\nclassification of scanned files, without presence on the scanning machine. We\nshowcase three attacks applicable to at least three anti-malware solutions that\ncould result in the disclosure of sensitive information and improper behavior\nof the anti-malware agent, such as ignoring detected threats. Finally, we\npropose and review a set of countermeasures for anti-malware solution providers\nto prevent the attacks stemming from the use of DNSAML services.",

However, this preeminence comes at a cost: their continuum\nnature makes it challenging to develop robust model-based control strategies.\nSpecifically, an adaptive control approach addressing this challenge has not\nyet been applied to physical soft robotic arms. This work presents a\nreformulation of dynamics for a soft continuum manipulator using the\nEuler-Lagrange method. The proposed model eliminates the simplifying assumption\nmade in previous works and provides a more accurate description of the robot's\ninertia. Based on our model, we introduce a task-space adaptive control scheme.\nThis controller is robust against model parameter uncertainties and unknown\ninput disturbances. The controller is implemented on a physical soft continuum\narm. A series of experiments were carried out to validate the effectiveness of\nthe controller in task-space trajectory tracking under different payloads. The\ncontroller outperforms the state-of-the-art method both in terms of accuracy\nand robustness. Moreover, the proposed model-based control design is flexible\nand can be generalized to any continuum robotic arm with an arbitrary number of\ncontinuum segments.",

    "title": "Cluster-based Mention Typing for Named Entity Disambiguation",
    "abstract": "An entity mention in text such as \"Washington\" may correspond to many\ndifferent named entities such as the city \"Washington D.C.\" or the newspaper\n\"Washington Post.\" The goal of named entity disambiguation is to identify the\nmentioned named entity correctly among all possible candidates. If the type\n(e.g. location or person) of a mentioned entity can be correctly predicted from\nthe context, it may increase the chance of selecting the right candidate by\nassigning low probability to the unlikely ones. This paper proposes\ncluster-based mention typing for named entity disambiguation. The aim of\nmention typing is to predict the type of a given mention based on its context.\nGenerally, manually curated type taxonomies such as Wikipedia categories are\nused. We introduce cluster-based mention typing, where named entities are\nclustered based on their contextual similarities and the cluster ids are\nassigned as types. The hyperlinked mentions and their context in Wikipedia are\nused in order to obtain these cluster-based types. Then, mention typing models\nare trained on these mentions, which have been labeled with their cluster-based\ntypes through distant supervision. At the named entity disambiguation phase,\nfirst the cluster-based types of a given mention are predicted and then, these\ntypes are used as features in a ranking model to select the best entity among\nthe candidates. We represent entities at multiple contextual levels and obtain\ndifferent clusterings (and thus typing models) based on each level. As each\nclustering breaks the entity space differently, mention typing based on each\nclustering discriminates the mention differently. When predictions from all\ntyping models are used together, our system achieves better or comparable\nresults based on randomization tests with respect to the state-of-the-art\nlevels on four defacto test sets.",

    "abstract": "Metropolitan scale vehicular traffic modeling is used by a variety of private\nand public sector urban mobility stakeholders to inform the design and\noperations of road networks. High-resolution stochastic traffic simulators are\nincreasingly used to describe detailed demand-supply interactions. The design\nof efficient calibration techniques remains a major challenge. This paper\nconsiders a class of high-dimensional calibration problems known as\norigin-destination (OD) calibration. We formulate the problem as a continuous\nsimulation-based optimization problem. Our proposed algorithm builds upon\nrecent metamodel methods that tackle the simulation-based problem by solving a\nsequence of approximate analytical optimization problems, which rely on the use\nof analytical network models. In this paper, we formulate a network model\ndefined as a system of linear equations, the dimension of which scales linearly\nwith the number of roads with field data and independently of the dimension of\nthe route choice set. This makes the approach suitable for large-scale\nmetropolitan networks. The approach has enhanced efficiency compared with past\nmetamodel formulations that are based on systems of nonlinear, rather than\nlinear, equations. It also has enhanced efficiency compared to traditional\ncalibration methods that resort to simulation-based estimates of traffic\nassignment matrices, while the proposed approach uses analytical approximations\nof these matrices. We benchmark the approach considering a peak period Salt\nLake City case study and calibrate based on field vehicular count data. The new\nformulation yields solutions with good performance and is suitable for\nlarge-scale road networks.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, various applications in computer vision have achieved\nsubstantial progress based on deep learning, which has been widely used for\nimage fusion and shown to achieve adequate performance. However, suffering from\nlimited ability in modelling the spatial correspondence of different source\nimages, it still remains a great challenge for existing unsupervised image\nfusion models to extract appropriate feature and achieves adaptive and balanced\nfusion. In this paper, we propose a novel cross attention-guided image fusion\nnetwork, which is a unified and unsupervised framework for multi-modal image\nfusion, multi-exposure image fusion, and multi-focus image fusion. Different\nfrom the existing self-attention module, our cross attention module focus on\nmodelling the cross-correlation between different source images. Using the\nproposed cross attention module as core block, a densely connected cross\nattention-guided network is built to dynamically learn the spatial\ncorrespondence to derive better alignment of important details from different\ninput images. Meanwhile, an auxiliary branch is also designed to model the\nlong-range information, and a merging network is attached to finally\nreconstruct the fusion image.

These LFs, in turn, have been\nused to generate a large amount of additional noisy labeled data, in a paradigm\nthat is now commonly referred to as data programming. However, previous\napproaches to automatically generate LFs make no attempt to further use the\ngiven labeled data for model training, thus giving up opportunities for\nimproved performance. Moreover, since the LFs are generated from a relatively\nsmall labeled dataset, they are prone to being noisy, and naively aggregating\nthese LFs can lead to very poor performance in practice. In this work, we\npropose an LF based reweighting framework \\ouralgo{} to solve these two\ncritical limitations. Our algorithm learns a joint model on the (same) labeled\ndataset used for LF induction along with any unlabeled data in a\nsemi-supervised manner, and more critically, reweighs each LF according to its\ngoodness, influencing its contribution to the semi-supervised loss using a\nrobust bi-level optimization algorithm.

Importantly, we design our atlases to be\ninterpretable and semantic, which facilitates easy and intuitive editing in the\natlas domain, with minimal manual work required.

    "abstract": "Embedding computation in biochemical environments incompatible with\ntraditional electronics is expected to have wide-ranging impact in synthetic\nbiology, medicine, nanofabrication and other fields. Natural biochemical\nsystems are typically modeled by chemical reaction networks (CRNs), and CRNs\ncan be used as a specification language for synthetic chemical computation. In\nthis paper, we identify a class of CRNs called non-competitive (NC) whose\nequilibria are absolutely robust to reaction rates and kinetic rate law,\nbecause their behavior is captured solely by their stoichiometric structure.\nUnlike prior work on rate-independent CRNs, checking non-competition and using\nit as a design criterion is easy and promises robust output. We also present a\ntechnique to program NC-CRNs using well-founded deep learning methods, showing\na translation procedure from rectified linear unit (ReLU) neural networks to\nNC-CRNs. In the case of binary weight ReLU networks, our translation procedure\nis surprisingly tight in the sense that a single bimolecular reaction\ncorresponds to a single ReLU node and vice versa. This compactness argues that\nneural networks may be a fitting paradigm for programming rate-independent\nchemical computation. As proof of principle, we demonstrate our scheme with\nnumerical simulations of CRNs translated from neural networks trained on\ntraditional machine learning datasets (IRIS and MNIST), as well as tasks better\naligned with potential biological applications including virus detection and\nspatial pattern formation.",

    "title": "Big Data driven Product Design: A Survey",
    "abstract": "With the improvement of living standards, user requirements of modern\nproducts are becoming increasingly more diversified and personalized.\nTraditional product design methods can no longer satisfy the market needs due\nto their strong subjectivity, small survey scope, poor real-time data, and lack\nof visual display, which calls for the development of big data driven product\ndesign methodology. Big data in the product lifecycle contains valuable\ninformation for guiding product design, such as customer preferences, market\ndemands, product evaluation, and visual display: online product reviews reflect\ncustomer evaluations and requirements; product images contain information of\nshape,color, and texture which can inspire designers to get initial design\nschemes more quickly or even directly generate new product images. How to\nefficiently collect product design related data and exploit them effectively\nduring the whole product design process is thus critical to modern product\ndesign. This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive survey on big data driven\nproduct design. It will help researchers and practitioners to comprehend the\nlatest development of relevant studies and applications centered on how big\ndata can be processed, analyzed, and exploited in aiding product design. We\nfirst introduce several representative traditional product design methods and\nhighlight their limitations. Then we discuss current and potential applications\nof textual data, image data, audio data, and video data in product design\ncycles. Finally, major deficiencies of existing data driven product design\nstudies and future research directions are summarized. We believe that this\nstudy can draw increasing attention to modern data driven product design.",

    "abstract": "Several techniques for multivariate time series anomaly detection have been\nproposed recently, but a systematic comparison on a common set of datasets and\nmetrics is lacking. This paper presents a systematic and comprehensive\nevaluation of unsupervised and semi-supervised deep-learning based methods for\nanomaly detection and diagnosis on multivariate time series data from\ncyberphysical systems. Unlike previous works, we vary the model and\npost-processing of model errors, i.e. the scoring functions independently of\neach other, through a grid of 10 models and 4 scoring functions, comparing\nthese variants to state of the art methods. In time-series anomaly detection,\ndetecting anomalous events is more important than detecting individual\nanomalous time-points. Through experiments, we find that the existing\nevaluation metrics either do not take events into account, or cannot\ndistinguish between a good detector and trivial detectors, such as a random or\nan all-positive detector. We propose a new metric to overcome these drawbacks,\nnamely, the composite F-score ($Fc_1$), for evaluating time-series anomaly\ndetection.\nOur study highlights that dynamic scoring functions work much better than\nstatic ones for multivariate time series anomaly detection, and the choice of\nscoring functions often matters more than the choice of the underlying model.\nWe also find that a simple, channel-wise model - the Univariate Fully-Connected\nAuto-Encoder, with the dynamic Gaussian scoring function emerges as a winning\ncandidate for both anomaly detection and diagnosis, beating state of the art\nalgorithms.",

However, both of these size shifts\nlead to similar disparate impacts on a classifier's accuracy, affecting\ndisproportionately more the underrepresented subparts of the data.

    "abstract": "Together with many success stories, promises such as the increase in\nproduction speed and the improvement in stakeholders' collaboration have\ncontributed to making agile a transformation in the software industry in which\nmany companies want to take part. However, driven either by a natural and\nexpected evolution or by contextual factors that challenge the adoption of\nagile methods as prescribed by their creator(s), software processes in practice\nmutate into hybrids over time. Are these still agile? In this article, we\ninvestigate the question: what makes a software development method agile? We\npresent an empirical study grounded in a large-scale international survey that\naims to identify software development methods and practices that improve or\ntame agility. Based on 556 data points, we analyze the perceived degree of\nagility in the implementation of standard project disciplines and its relation\nto used development methods and practices. Our findings suggest that only a\nsmall number of participants operate their projects in a purely traditional or\nagile manner (under 15%). That said, most project disciplines and most\npractices show a clear trend towards increasing degrees of agility. Compared to\nthe methods used to develop software, the selection of practices has a stronger\neffect on the degree of agility of a given discipline. Finally, there are no\nmethods or practices that explicitly guarantee or prevent agility. We conclude\nthat agility cannot be defined solely at the process level. Additional factors\nneed to be taken into account when trying to implement or improve agility in a\nsoftware company. Finally, we discuss the field of software process-related\nresearch in the light of our findings and present a roadmap for future\nresearch.",

This data is \"interesting\" for humans and leads to numerous\napplications. Deep learning (DNNs) drastically improved the algorithms\nefficiency on the main benchmark datasets. However, DNN-based models are\ncounter-intuitive: surprising or unusual data is by definition difficult to\nlearn because of its low occurrence probability. In reality, DNN-based models\nmainly learn top-down features such as faces, text, people, or animals which\nusually attract human attention, but they have low efficiency in extracting\nsurprising or unusual data in the images. In this paper, we propose a new\nvisual attention model called DeepRare2021 (DR21) which uses the power of DNNs\nfeature extraction and the genericity of feature-engineered algorithms. This\nalgorithm is an evolution of a previous version called DeepRare2019 (DR19)\nbased on a common framework. DR21 1) does not need any training and uses the\ndefault ImageNet training, 2) is fast even on CPU, 3) is tested on four very\ndifferent eye-tracking datasets showing that the DR21 is generic and is always\nin the within the top models on all datasets and metrics while no other model\nexhibits such a regularity and genericity. Finally DR21 4) is tested with\nseveral network architectures such as VGG16 (V16), VGG19 (V19) and MobileNetV2\n(MN2) and 5) it provides explanation and transparency on which parts of the\nimage are the most surprising at different levels despite the use of a\nDNN-based feature extractor.

Precisely, we aim at learning a neural\nnetwork that implicitly represents the data and an additional neural network\nthat models the vector fields of the dependent variables. We combine these two\nnetworks by enforcing the constraint that the data at the next time-steps can\nbe given by following a numerical integration scheme such as the fourth-order\nRunge-Kutta scheme.

    "abstract": "Outdoor scene completion is a challenging issue in 3D scene understanding,\nwhich plays an important role in intelligent robotics and autonomous driving.\nDue to the sparsity of LiDAR acquisition, it is far more complex for 3D scene\ncompletion and semantic segmentation. Since semantic features can provide\nconstraints and semantic priors for completion tasks, the relationship between\nthem is worth exploring. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end semantic\nsegmentation-assisted scene completion network, including a 2D completion\nbranch and a 3D semantic segmentation branch. Specifically, the network takes a\nraw point cloud as input, and merges the features from the segmentation branch\ninto the completion branch hierarchically to provide semantic information. By\nadopting BEV representation and 3D sparse convolution, we can benefit from the\nlower operand while maintaining effective expression. Besides, the decoder of\nthe segmentation branch is used as an auxiliary, which can be discarded in the\ninference stage to save computational consumption. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance on SemanticKITTI\ndataset with low latency.

    "abstract": "Replanners are efficient methods for solving non-deterministic planning\nproblems. Despite showing good scalability, existing replanners often fail to\nsolve problems involving a large number of misleading plans, i.e., weak plans\nthat do not lead to strong solutions, however, due to their minimal lengths,\nare likely to be found at every replanning iteration. The poor performance of\nreplanners in such problems is due to their all-outcome determinization. That\nis, when compiling from non-deterministic to classical, they include all\ncompiled classical operators in a single deterministic domain which leads\nreplanners to continually generate misleading plans. We introduce an offline\nreplanner, called Safe-Planner (SP), that relies on a single-outcome\ndeterminization to compile a non-deterministic domain to a set of classical\ndomains, and ordering heuristics for ranking the obtained classical domains.\nThe proposed single-outcome determinization and the heuristics allow for\nalternating between different classical domains. We show experimentally that\nthis approach can allow SP to avoid generating misleading plans but to generate\nweak plans that directly lead to strong solutions. The experiments show that SP\noutperforms state-of-the-art non-deterministic solvers by solving a broader\nrange of problems. We also validate the practical utility of SP in real-world\nnon-deterministic robotic tasks.",

TLG is inherently a challenging task, as it requires to have\ncomprehensive understanding of both video contents and text sentences. Previous\nworks either tackle this task in a fully-supervised setting that requires a\nlarge amount of manual annotations or in a weakly supervised setting that\ncannot achieve satisfactory performance. To achieve good performance with\nlimited annotations, we tackle this task in a semi-supervised way and propose a\nunified Semi-supervised Temporal Language Grounding (STLG) framework. STLG\nconsists of two parts: (1) A pseudo label generation module that produces\nadaptive instant pseudo labels for unlabeled data based on predictions from a\nteacher model; (2) A self-supervised feature learning module with two\nsequential perturbations, i.e., time lagging and time scaling, for improving\nthe video representation by inter-modal and intra-modal contrastive learning.\nWe conduct experiments on the ActivityNet-CD-OOD and Charades-CD-OOD datasets\nand the results demonstrate that our proposed STLG framework achieve\ncompetitive performance compared to fully-supervised state-of-the-art methods\nwith only a small portion of temporal annotations.",

We\nfirst propose a novel interpretation method for unsupervised DNNs by\nformulating and solving well-designed optimization problems with special\nconstraints for security domains.

In detail, our framework involves sparse label-appearance encoding,\ninter-object relation adaptation and intra-object knowledge mapping to obtain\nthe instructive knowledge. Modules in LGD are trained end-to-end with student\ndetector and are discarded in inference. Empirically, LGD obtains decent\nresults on various detectors, datasets, and extensive task like instance\nsegmentation. For example in MS-COCO dataset, LGD improves RetinaNet with\nResNet-50 under 2x single-scale training from 36.2% to 39.0% mAP (+ 2.8%). For\nmuch stronger detectors like FCOS with ResNeXt-101 DCN v2 under 2x multi-scale\ntraining (46.1%), LGD achieves 47.9% (+ 1.8%). For pedestrian detection in\nCrowdHuman dataset, LGD boosts mMR by 2.3% for Faster R-CNN with ResNet-50.\nCompared with a classical teacher-based method FGFI, LGD not only performs\nbetter without requiring pretrained teacher but also with 51% lower training\ncost beyond inherent student learning.",

We also discovered that after\ncontrolling for the interaction effect, the correct relative importance for\nLSTMs for an IDS is batch-size, followed by dropout ratio and padding.

Semi-automatic Lite2Pyramid retains the\nreusable human-labeled Summary Content Units (SCUs) for reference(s) but\nreplaces the manual work of judging SCUs' presence in system summaries with a\nnatural language inference (NLI) model. Fully automatic Lite3Pyramid further\nsubstitutes SCUs with automatically extracted Semantic Triplet Units (STUs) via\na semantic role labeling (SRL) model. Finally, we propose in-between metrics,\nLite2.xPyramid, where we use a simple regressor to predict how well the STUs\ncan simulate SCUs and retain SCUs that are more difficult to simulate, which\nprovides a smooth transition and balance between automation and manual\nevaluation. Comparing to 15 existing metrics, we evaluate human-metric\ncorrelations on 3 existing meta-evaluation datasets and our newly-collected\nPyrXSum (with 100/10 XSum examples/systems). It shows that Lite2Pyramid\nconsistently has the best summary-level correlations; Lite3Pyramid works better\nthan or comparable to other automatic metrics; Lite2.xPyramid trades off small\ncorrelation drops for larger manual effort reduction, which can reduce costs\nfor future data collection.

MARMOT outperforms an ensemble text-only\nclassifier in 19 of 20 categories in multilabel classifications of tweets\nreporting election incidents during the 2016 U.S. general election. Moreover,\nMARMOT shows significant improvements over the results of benchmark multimodal\nmodels on the Hateful Memes dataset, improving the best result set by\nVisualBERT in terms of accuracy from 0.6473 to 0.6760 and area under the\nreceiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) from 0.7141 to 0.7530.",

    "title": "Mixed-supervised segmentation: Confidence maximization helps knowledge  distillation",
    "abstract": "Despite achieving promising results in a breadth of medical image\nsegmentation tasks, deep neural networks require large training datasets with\npixel-wise annotations. Obtaining these curated datasets is a cumbersome\nprocess which limits the application in scenarios where annotated images are\nscarce. Mixed supervision is an appealing alternative for mitigating this\nobstacle, where only a small fraction of the data contains complete pixel-wise\nannotations and other images have a weaker form of supervision. In this work,\nwe propose a dual-branch architecture, where the upper branch (teacher)\nreceives strong annotations, while the bottom one (student) is driven by\nlimited supervision and guided by the upper branch. Combined with a standard\ncross-entropy loss over the labeled pixels, our novel formulation integrates\ntwo important terms: (i) a Shannon entropy loss defined over the\nless-supervised images, which encourages confident student predictions in the\nbottom branch; and (ii) a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence term, which\ntransfers the knowledge of the strongly supervised branch to the\nless-supervised branch and guides the entropy (student-confidence) term to\navoid trivial solutions. We show that the synergy between the entropy and KL\ndivergence yields substantial improvements in performance. We also discuss an\ninteresting link between Shannon-entropy minimization and standard pseudo-mask\ngeneration, and argue that the former should be preferred over the latter for\nleveraging information from unlabeled pixels. Quantitative and qualitative\nresults on two publicly available datasets demonstrate that our method\nsignificantly outperforms other strategies for semantic segmentation within a\nmixed-supervision framework, as well as recent semi-supervised approaches.\nMoreover, we show that the branch trained with reduced supervision and guided\nby the top branch largely outperforms the latter.",

The availability of user identifiers per trade\nallows us to focus on the historical record of 440 investors, detected as\narbitrageurs, and consequently to describe their trading behavior. We begin by\nshowing that a considerable difference appears between arbitrageurs when\nindicators of their expertise are taken into account. In particular, we\ndistinguish between those who conducted arbitrage in a single or in multiple\nmarkets: using this element as a proxy for trade ability, we find that\narbitrage actions performed by expert users are on average non-profitable when\ntransaction costs are accounted for, while skilled investors conduct arbitrage\nat a positive and statistically significant premium. Next, we show that\nspecific trading strategies, such as splitting orders or conducting arbitrage\nnon aggressively, are further indicators of expertise that increase the\nprofitability of arbitrage. Most importantly, we exploit within-user (across\nhours and markets) variation and document that expert users make profits on\narbitrage by reacting quickly to plausible exogenous variations on the official\nexchange rates. We present further evidence that such differences are chiefly\ndue to a better ability of the latter in incorporating information, both on the\ntransactions costs and on the exchange rates volatility, eventually resulting\nin a better timing choice at small time scale intervals.

Seminal results of Bravyi &\nTerhal, and Bravyi, Poulin & Terhal have shown that quantum LDPC codes\nimplemented through local interactions obey restrictions on their dimension $k$\nand distance $d$. Here we address the complementary question of how many\nlong-range interactions are required to implement a quantum LDPC code with\nparameters $k$ and $d$.

For\nexample, it is an essential component of GLM optimization algorithms, where an\nexponential family is used to model the entries of a matrix, and the matrix of\nnatural parameters admits a low-rank structure. We propose an algorithm for\nsolving the weighted problem, as well as two acceleration techniques. Further,\nwe develop a non-SVD modification of the proposed algorithm that is able to\nhandle extremely high-dimensional data. We compare the performance of all the\nmethods on a small simulation example as well as a real-data application.",

    "abstract": "Satellite multi-view stereo (MVS) imagery is particularly suited for\nlarge-scale Earth surface reconstruction. Differing from the perspective camera\nmodel (pin-hole model) that is commonly used for close-range and aerial\ncameras, the cubic rational polynomial camera (RPC) model is the mainstream\nmodel for push-broom linear-array satellite cameras. However, the homography\nwarping used in the prevailing learning based MVS methods is only applicable to\npin-hole cameras. In order to apply the SOTA learning based MVS technology to\nthe satellite MVS task for large-scale Earth surface reconstruction, RPC\nwarping should be considered. In this work, we propose, for the first time, a\nrigorous RPC warping module. The rational polynomial coefficients are recorded\nas a tensor, and the RPC warping is formulated as a series of tensor\ntransformations. Based on the RPC warping, we propose the deep learning based\nsatellite MVS (SatMVS) framework for large-scale and wide depth range Earth\nsurface reconstruction. We also introduce a large-scale satellite image dataset\nconsisting of 519 5120${\\times}$5120 images, which we call the TLC SatMVS\ndataset. The satellite images were acquired from a three-line camera (TLC) that\ncatches triple-view images simultaneously, forming a valuable supplement to the\nexisting open-source WorldView-3 datasets with single-scanline images.\nExperiments show that the proposed RPC warping module and the SatMVS framework\ncan achieve a superior reconstruction accuracy compared to the pin-hole fitting\nmethod and conventional MVS methods.

The goal of the game is to have a single peg remaining on the\nboard by sequentially jumping a peg over an adjacent peg onto an empty square\nwhile eliminating the jumped peg. Conway's soldiers is a related game played on\n$\\mathbb{Z}^2$ with pegs initially located on the half-space $y \\le 0$. The\ngoal is to bring a peg as far as possible on the board using peg solitaire\njumps. Conway showed that bringing a peg to the line $y = 5$ is impossible with\nfinitely many jumps. Applying Conway's approach, we prove an analogous\nimpossibility property on graphs. In addition, we generalize peg solitaire on\nfinite graphs as introduced by Beeler and Hoilman (2011) to an infinite game\nplayed on countably infinite graphs.",

    "abstract": "Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) often relies on the separability\ncondition for tractable algorithm design. Separability-based NMF is mainly\nhandled by two types of approaches, namely, greedy pursuit and convex\nprogramming. A notable convex NMF formulation is the so-called self-dictionary\nmultiple measurement vectors (SD-MMV), which can work without knowing the\nmatrix rank a priori, and is arguably more resilient to error propagation\nrelative to greedy pursuit. However, convex SD-MMV renders a large memory cost\nthat scales quadratically with the problem size. This memory challenge has been\naround for a decade, and a major obstacle for applying convex SD-MMV to big\ndata analytics. This work proposes a memory-efficient algorithm for convex\nSD-MMV. Our algorithm capitalizes on the special update rules of a classic\nalgorithm from the 1950s, namely, the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm. It is shown\nthat, under reasonable conditions, the FW algorithm solves the noisy SD-MMV\nproblem with a memory cost that grows linearly with the amount of data. To\nhandle noisier scenarios, a smoothed group sparsity regularizer is proposed to\nimprove robustness while maintaining the low memory footprint with guarantees.\nThe proposed approach presents the first linear memory complexity algorithmic\nframework for convex SD-MMV based NMF. The method is tested over a couple of\nunsupervised learning tasks, i.e., text mining and community detection, to\nshowcase its effectiveness and memory efficiency.",

    "abstract": "We study the robust recovery of a low-rank matrix from sparsely and grossly\ncorrupted Gaussian measurements, with no prior knowledge on the intrinsic rank.\nWe consider the robust matrix factorization approach. We employ a robust\n$\\ell_1$ loss function and deal with the challenge of the unknown rank by using\nan overspecified factored representation of the matrix variable. We then solve\nthe associated nonconvex nonsmooth problem using a subgradient method with\ndiminishing stepsizes. We show that under a regularity condition on the sensing\nmatrices and corruption, which we call restricted direction preserving property\n(RDPP), even with rank overspecified, the subgradient method converges to the\nexact low-rank solution at a sublinear rate. Moreover, our result is more\ngeneral in the sense that it automatically speeds up to a linear rate once the\nfactor rank matches the unknown rank. On the other hand, we show that the RDPP\ncondition holds under generic settings, such as Gaussian measurements under\nindependent or adversarial sparse corruptions, where the result could be of\nindependent interest. Both the exact recovery and the convergence rate of the\nproposed subgradient method are numerically verified in the overspecified\nregime. Moreover, our experiment further shows that our particular design of\ndiminishing stepsize effectively prevents overfitting for robust recovery under\noverparameterized models, such as robust matrix sensing and learning robust\ndeep image prior. This regularization effect is worth further investigation.",

    "title": "Revisit Geophysical Imaging in A New View of Physics-informed Generative  Adversarial Learning",
    "abstract": "Seismic full waveform inversion (FWI) is a powerful geophysical imaging\ntechnique that produces high-resolution subsurface models by iteratively\nminimizing the misfit between the simulated and observed seismograms.\nUnfortunately, conventional FWI with least-squares function suffers from many\ndrawbacks such as the local-minima problem and computation of explicit\ngradient. It is particularly challenging with the contaminated measurements or\npoor starting models. Recent works relying on partial differential equations\nand neural networks show promising performance for two-dimensional FWI.\nInspired by the competitive learning of generative adversarial networks, we\nproposed an unsupervised learning paradigm that integrates wave equation with a\ndiscriminate network to accurately estimate the physically consistent models in\na distribution sense. Our framework needs no labelled training data nor\npretraining of the network, is flexible to achieve multi-parameters inversion\nwith minimal user interaction. The proposed method faithfully recovers the\nwell-known synthetic models that outperforms the classical algorithms.\nFurthermore, our work paves the way to sidestep the local-minima issue via\nreducing the sensitivity to initial models and noise.",

    "title": "Improving Tuberculosis (TB) Prediction using Synthetically Generated  Computed Tomography (CT) Images",
    "abstract": "The evaluation of infectious disease processes on radiologic images is an\nimportant and challenging task in medical image analysis. Pulmonary infections\ncan often be best imaged and evaluated through computed tomography (CT) scans,\nwhich are often not available in low-resource environments and difficult to\nobtain for critically ill patients. On the other hand, X-ray, a different type\nof imaging procedure, is inexpensive, often available at the bedside and more\nwidely available, but offers a simpler, two dimensional image. We show that by\nrelying on a model that learns to generate CT images from X-rays synthetically,\nwe can improve the automatic disease classification accuracy and provide\nclinicians with a different look at the pulmonary disease process.\nSpecifically, we investigate Tuberculosis (TB), a deadly bacterial infectious\ndisease that predominantly affects the lungs, but also other organ systems. We\nshow that relying on synthetically generated CT improves TB identification by\n7.50% and distinguishes TB properties up to 12.16% better than the X-ray\nbaseline.",

We propose an active-set stochastic sequential quadratic\nprogramming algorithm, using a differentiable exact augmented Lagrangian as the\nmerit function. The algorithm adaptively selects the penalty parameters of\naugmented Lagrangian and performs stochastic line search to decide the\nstepsize. The global convergence is established: for any initialization, the\n\"liminf\" of the KKT residuals converges to zero almost surely. Our algorithm\nand analysis further develop the prior work \\cite{Na2021Adaptive} by allowing\nnonlinear inequality constraints.
