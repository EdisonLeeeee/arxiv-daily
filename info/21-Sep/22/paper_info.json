    "title": "Robust Optimization of Instantaneous Beamforming and Quasi-static Phase  Shifts in an IRS-assisted Multi-Cell Network",
    "abstract": "The impacts of channel estimation errors, inter-cell interference, phase\nadjustment cost, and computation cost on an intelligent reflecting surface\n(IRS)-assisted system are severe in practice but have been ignored for\nsimplicity in most existing works. In this paper, we investigate a\nmulti-antenna base station (BS) serving a single-antenna user with the help of\na multi-element IRS in a multi-cell network with inter-cell interference. We\nconsider imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the BS, i.e., imperfect\nCSIT, and focus on the robust optimization of the BS's instantaneous\nCSI-adaptive beamforming and the IRS's quasi-static phase shifts in two\nscenarios. In the scenario of coding over many slots, we formulate a robust\noptimization problem to maximize the user's ergodic rate. In the scenario of\ncoding within each slot, we formulate a robust optimization problem to maximize\nthe user's average goodput under the successful transmission probability\nconstraints. The robust optimization problems are challenging two-timescale\nstochastic non-convex problems. In both scenarios, we obtain closed-form robust\nbeamforming designs for any given phase shifts and more tractable stochastic\nnon-convex approximate problems only for the phase shifts. Besides, we propose\nan iterative algorithm to obtain a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of each of\nthe stochastic problems for the phase shifts. It is worth noting that the\nproposed methods offer closed-form robust instantaneous CSI-adaptive\nbeamforming designs which can promptly adapt to rapid CSI changes over slots\nand robust quasi-static phase shift designs of low computation and phase\nadjustment costs in the presence of imperfect CSIT and inter-cell interference.\nNumerical results further demonstrate the notable gains of the proposed robust\njoint designs over existing ones and reveal the practical values of the\nproposed solutions.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we revisit the 2014 NeurIPS experiment that examined\ninconsistency in conference peer review. We determine that 50\\% of the\nvariation in reviewer quality scores was subjective in origin. Further, with\nseven years passing since the experiment we find that for \\emph{accepted}\npapers, there is no correlation between quality scores and impact of the paper\nas measured as a function of citation count. We trace the fate of rejected\npapers, recovering where these papers were eventually published. For these\npapers we find a correlation between quality scores and impact. We conclude\nthat the reviewing process for the 2014 conference was good for identifying\npoor papers, but poor for identifying good papers. We give some suggestions for\nimproving the reviewing process but also warn against removing the subjective\nelement. Finally, we suggest that the real conclusion of the experiment is that\nthe community should place less onus on the notion of `top-tier conference\npublications' when assessing the quality of individual researchers. For NeurIPS\n2021, the PCs are repeating the experiment, as well as conducting new ones.",

    "abstract": "Most previous work on grammar induction focuses on learning phrasal or\ndependency structure purely from text. However, because the signal provided by\ntext alone is limited, recently introduced visually grounded syntax models make\nuse of multimodal information leading to improved performance in constituency\ngrammar induction. However, as compared to dependency grammars, constituency\ngrammars do not provide a straightforward way to incorporate visual information\nwithout enforcing language-specific heuristics. In this paper, we propose an\nunsupervised grammar induction model that leverages word concreteness and a\nstructural vision-based heuristic to jointly learn constituency-structure and\ndependency-structure grammars. Our experiments find that concreteness is a\nstrong indicator for learning dependency grammars, improving the direct\nattachment score (DAS) by over 50\\% as compared to state-of-the-art models\ntrained on pure text. Next, we propose an extension of our model that leverages\nboth word concreteness and visual semantic role labels in constituency and\ndependency parsing. Our experiments show that the proposed extension\noutperforms the current state-of-the-art visually grounded models in\nconstituency parsing even with a smaller grammar size.",

The use of feedback policies for prediction is motivated by the\nneed for reduced conservatism in handling multi-modal predictions of the\nsurrounding vehicles, especially prevalent in traffic intersection scenarios.\nWe evaluate our algorithm along axes of mobility, comfort, conservatism and\ncomputational efficiency at a simulated intersection in CARLA. Our simulations\nuse a kinematic bicycle model and multimodal predictions trained on a subset of\nthe Lyft Level 5 prediction dataset. To demonstrate the impact of optimizing\nover feedback policies, we compare our algorithm with two SMPC baselines that\nhandle multi-modal collision avoidance chance constraints by optimizing over\nopen-loop sequences.",

    "abstract": "Metamorphic testing (MT) is widely used for testing programs that face the\noracle problem. It uses a set of metamorphic relations (MRs), which are\nrelations among multiple inputs and their corresponding outputs to determine\nwhether the program under test is faulty. Typically, MRs vary in their ability\nto detect faults in the program under test, and some MRs tend to detect the\nsame set of faults. In this paper, we propose approaches to prioritize MRs to\nimprove the efficiency and effectiveness of MT for regression testing. We\npresent two MR prioritization approaches: (1) fault-based and (2)\ncoverage-based. To evaluate these MR prioritization approaches, we conduct\nexperiments on three complex open-source software systems. Our results show\nthat the MR prioritization approaches developed by us significantly outperform\nthe current practice of executing the source and follow-up test cases of the\nMRs in an ad-hoc manner in terms of fault detection effectiveness. Further,\nfault-based MR prioritization leads to reducing the number of source and\nfollow-up test cases that needs to be executed as well as reducing the average\ntime taken to detect a fault, which would result in saving time and cost during\nthe testing process.",

In the\nproposed design, instead of tracking the original target zone, a robust control\ninvariant set within the target zone is determined and is used as the actual\nzone tracked in the proposed EMPC. This approach ensures that the zone tracking\nobjective is achieved within finite steps and once the zone tracking objective\nis achieved (the system state enters the robust control invariant set), the\nsystem state does not come out of the target zone anymore. To optimize the\neconomic performance within the zone in the presence of disturbances, we\nintroduce the notion of risk factor in the controller design. An algorithm to\ndetermine the economic zone to be tracked is provided. The risk factor\ndetermines the conservativeness of the controller and provides a way to tune\nthe EMPC for better economic performance.

    "title": "A Data-Driven Democratized Control Architecture for Regional  Transmission Operators",
    "abstract": "As probably the most complicated and critical infrastructure system, U.S.\npower grids become increasingly vulnerable to extreme events such as\ncyber-attacks and severe weather, as well as higher DER penetrations and\ngrowing information mismatch among system operators, utilities (transmission or\ngeneration owners), and end-users. This paper proposes a data-driven\ndemocratized control architecture considering two democratization pathways to\nassist transmission system operators, with a targeted use case of developing\nonline proactive islanding strategies. Detailed discussions on load capability\nprofiling at transmission buses and disaggregation of DER generations are\nprovided and illustrated with real-world utility data. By Combining network and\noperational constraints, transmission system operators can be equipped with new\ntools built on top of this architecture, to derive accurate, proactive, and\nstrategic islanding decisions to incorporate the wide range of dynamic\nportfolios and needs when facing extreme events or unseen grid contingencies.",

In\nthis work, we robustly remove bias and spurious variation from an automated\nmelanoma classification pipeline using two leading bias unlearning techniques.\nWe show that the biases introduced by surgical markings and rulers presented in\nprevious studies can be reasonably mitigated using these bias removal methods.\nWe also demonstrate the generalisation benefits of unlearning spurious\nvariation relating to the imaging instrument used to capture lesion images.\nContributions of this work include the application of different debiasing\ntechniques for artefact bias removal and the concept of instrument bias\nunlearning for domain generalisation in melanoma detection. Our experimental\nresults provide evidence that the effects of each of the aforementioned biases\nare notably reduced, with different debiasing techniques excelling at different\ntasks.",

    "abstract": "In robotics perception, numerous tasks rely on point cloud registration.\nHowever, currently there is no method that can automatically detect misaligned\npoint clouds reliably and without environment-specific parameters. We propose\n\"CorAl\", an alignment quality measure and alignment classifier for point cloud\npairs, which facilitates the ability to introspectively assess the performance\nof registration. CorAl compares the joint and the separate entropy of the two\npoint clouds. The separate entropy provides a measure of the entropy that can\nbe expected to be inherent to the environment. The joint entropy should\ntherefore not be substantially higher if the point clouds are properly aligned.\nComputing the expected entropy makes the method sensitive also to small\nalignment errors, which are particularly hard to detect, and applicable in a\nrange of different environments. We found that CorAl is able to detect small\nalignment errors in previously unseen environments with an accuracy of 95% and\nachieve a substantial improvement to previous methods.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a comprehensive architecture for confidential\ncomputing, which we show to be general purpose and quite efficient. It executes\nthe application as is, without any added burden or discipline requirements from\nthe application developers. Furthermore, it does not require the trust of\nsystem software at the computing server and does not impose any added burden on\nthe communication subsystem. The proposed Encrypted Data Processing (EDAP)\narchitecture accomplishes confidentiality, authenticity, and freshness of the\nkey-based cryptographic data protection by adopting data encryption with a\nmulti-level key protection scheme. It guarantees that the user data is visible\nonly in non-privileged mode to a designated program trusted by the data owner\non a designated hardware, thus protecting the data from an untrusted hardware,\nhypervisor, OS, or other users' applications. The cryptographic keys and\nprotocols used for achieving these confidential computing requirements are\ndescribed in a use case example. Encrypting and decrypting data in an\nEDAP-enabled processor can lead to performance degradation as it adds cycle\ntime to the overall execution. However, our simulation result shows that the\nslowdown is only 6% on average across a collection of commercial workloads when\nthe data encryption engine is placed between the L1 and L2 cache. We\ndemonstrate that the EDAP architecture is valuable and practicable in the\nmodern cloud environment for confidential computing. EDAP delivers a zero trust\nmodel of computing where the user software does not trust system software and\nvice versa.",

Such an asymptotic result validates the wide-accepted\nassumption of Gaussian noise. We clarify that the recently observed phenomenon\nof heavy tails within gradient noise may not be intrinsic properties, but the\nconsequence of insufficient mini-batch size; the gradient noise, which is a sum\nof limited i.i.d. random variables, has not reached the asymptotic regime of\nCLT, thus deviates from Gaussian.

In this paper, we focus on such target\ntracking problems in adversarial environments, where attacks or failures may\ndeactivate robots' sensors and communications. In contrast to the previous\nworks that consider no attacks or sensing attacks only, we formalize the first\nrobust multi-robot tracking framework that accounts for any fixed numbers of\nworst-case sensing and communication attacks. To secure against such attacks,\nwe design the first robust planning algorithm, named Robust Active Target\nTracking (RATT), which approximates the communication attacks to equivalent\nsensing attacks and then optimizes against the approximated and original\nsensing attacks. We show that RATT provides provable suboptimality bounds on\nthe tracking quality for any non-decreasing objective function. Our analysis\nutilizes the notations of curvature for set functions introduced in\ncombinatorial optimization. In addition, RATT runs in polynomial time and\nterminates with the same running time as state-of-the-art algorithms for\n(non-robust) target tracking. Finally, we evaluate RATT with both qualitative\nand quantitative simulations across various scenarios. In the evaluations, RATT\nexhibits a tracking quality that is near-optimal and superior to varying\nnon-robust heuristics. We also demonstrate RATT's superiority and robustness\nagainst varying attack models (e.g., worst-case and bounded rational attacks).",

In such problems, it is often the case that rare classes associated\nto less prevalent diseases are severely under-represented in labeled databases,\ntypically resulting in poor performance of machine learning algorithms due to\noverfitting in the learning process. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmechanism for sampling training data based on the popular MixUp regularization\ntechnique, which we refer to as Balanced-MixUp. In short, Balanced-MixUp\nsimultaneously performs regular (i.e., instance-based) and balanced (i.e.,\nclass-based) sampling of the training data. The resulting two sets of samples\nare then mixed-up to create a more balanced training distribution from which a\nneural network can effectively learn without incurring in heavily under-fitting\nthe minority classes. We experiment with a highly imbalanced dataset of retinal\nimages (55K samples, 5 classes) and a long-tail dataset of gastro-intestinal\nvideo frames (10K images, 23 classes), using two CNNs of varying representation\ncapabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that applying Balanced-MixUp\noutperforms other conventional sampling schemes and loss functions specifically\ndesigned to deal with imbalanced data.

    "abstract": "This demonstration paper presents StreamSide, an open-source toolkit for\nannotating multiple kinds of meaning representations. StreamSide supports\nframe-based annotation schemes e.g., Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) and\nframeless annotation schemes e.g., Widely Interpretable Semantic Representation\n(WISeR). Moreover, it supports both sentence-level and document-level\nannotation by allowing annotators to create multi-rooted graphs for input text.\nIt can open and automatically convert between several types of input formats\nincluding plain text, Penman notation, and its own JSON format enabling richer\nannotation. It features reference frames for AMR predicate argument structures,\nand also concept-to-text alignment. StreamSide is released under the Apache 2.0\nlicense, and is completely open-source so that it can be customized to annotate\nenriched meaning representations in different languages (e.g., Uniform Meaning\nRepresentations). All StreamSide resources are publicly distributed through our\nopen source project at: https://github.com/emorynlp/StreamSide.",

The state of each arm evolves according to a\ncontrolled Markov decision process (MDP), and the reward of pulling an arm\ndepends on both the current state of the corresponding MDP and the action\ntaken. The goal is to sequentially choose actions for arms so as to maximize\nthe expected value of the cumulative rewards collected. Since finding the\noptimal policy is typically intractable, we propose a computationally appealing\nindex policy which we call Occupancy-Measured-Reward Index Policy. Our policy\nis well-defined even if the underlying MDPs are not indexable. We prove that it\nis asymptotically optimal when the activation budget and number of arms are\nscaled up, while keeping their ratio as a constant. For the case when the\nsystem parameters are unknown, we develop a learning algorithm. Our learning\nalgorithm uses the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty and further\nuses a generative model in order to fully exploit the structure of\nOccupancy-Measured-Reward Index Policy. We call it the R(MA)^2B-UCB algorithm.\nAs compared with the existing algorithms, R(MA)^2B-UCB performs close to an\noffline optimum policy, and also achieves a sub-linear regret with a low\ncomputational complexity.

We present a lightweight and effective language identifier that is\nrobust to changes of domain and to the absence of copious training data.\nThe key idea for classification is that the reciprocal of the rank in a\nfrequency table makes an effective additive feature score, hence the term\nReciprocal Rank Classifier (RRC). The key finding for language classification\nis that ranked lists of words and frequencies of characters form a sufficient\nand robust representation of the regularities of key languages and their\northographies.\nWe test this on two 22-language data sets and demonstrate zero-effort domain\nadaptation from a Wikipedia training set to a Twitter test set. When trained on\nWikipedia but applied to Twitter the macro-averaged F1-score of a\nconventionally trained SVM classifier drops from 90.9% to 77.7%. By contrast,\nthe macro F1-score of RRC drops only from 93.1% to 90.6%. These classifiers are\ncompared with those from fastText and langid. The RRC performs better than\nthese established systems in most experiments, especially on short Wikipedia\ntexts and Twitter.\nThe RRC classifier can be improved for particular domains and conversational\nsituations by adding words to the ranked lists. Using new terms learned from\nsuch conversations, we demonstrate a further 7.9% increase in accuracy of\nsample message classification, and 1.7% increase for conversation\nclassification.

This approach, however, is very\ninefficient and incurs significant resource overheads. Hence, a learning-based\napproach known as parity model (ParM) has been recently proposed which learns\nmodels that can generate parities for a group of predictions in order to\nreconstruct the predictions of the slow/failed workers. While this\nlearning-based approach is more resource-efficient than replication, it is\ntailored to the specific model hosted by the cloud and is particularly suitable\nfor a small number of queries (typically less than four) and tolerating very\nfew (mostly one) number of stragglers. Moreover, ParM does not handle Byzantine\nadversarial workers. We propose a different approach, named Approximate Coded\nInference (ApproxIFER), that does not require training of any parity models,\nhence it is agnostic to the model hosted by the cloud and can be readily\napplied to different data domains and model architectures. Compared with\nearlier works, ApproxIFER can handle a general number of stragglers and scales\nsignificantly better with the number of queries. Furthermore, ApproxIFER is\nrobust against Byzantine workers.

A balanced clique-based separator of $G(F)$ is a set $S$\nconsisting of cliques whose removal partitions $G(F)$ into components of size\nat most $\\delta n$, for some fixed constant $\\delta<1$. The weight of a\nclique-based separator is defined as $\\sum_{C\\in S}\\log (|C|+1)$. Recently De\nBerg et al. (SICOMP 2020) proved that if $S$ consists of convex fat objects,\nthen $G(F)$ admits a balanced clique-based separator of weight $O(\\sqrt{n})$.\nWe extend this result in several directions, obtaining the following results.\nMap graphs admit a balanced clique-based separator of weight $O(\\sqrt{n})$,\nwhich is tight in the worst case. Intersection graphs of pseudo-disks admit a\nbalanced clique-based separator of weight $O(n^{2/3}\\log n)$. If the\npseudo-disks are polygonal and of total complexity $O(n)$ then the weight of\nthe separator improves to $O(\\sqrt{n}\\log n)$. Intersection graphs of geodesic\ndisks inside a simple polygon admit a balanced clique-based separator of weight\n$O(n^{2/3}\\log n)$. Visibility-restricted unit-disk graphs in a polygonal\ndomain with $r$ reflex vertices admit a balanced clique-based separator of\nweight $O(\\sqrt{n}+r\\log(n/r))$, which is tight in the worst case.

    "abstract": "Few-shot classification aims at classifying categories of a novel task by\nlearning from just a few (typically, 1 to 5) labelled examples. An effective\napproach to few-shot classification involves a prior model trained on a\nlarge-sample base domain, which is then finetuned over the novel few-shot task\nto yield generalizable representations. However, task-specific finetuning is\nprone to overfitting due to the lack of enough training examples. To alleviate\nthis issue, we propose a new finetuning approach based on contrastive learning\nthat reuses unlabelled examples from the base domain in the form of\ndistractors. Unlike the nature of unlabelled data used in prior works,\ndistractors belong to classes that do not overlap with the novel categories. We\ndemonstrate for the first time that inclusion of such distractors can\nsignificantly boost few-shot generalization. Our technical novelty includes a\nstochastic pairing of examples sharing the same category in the few-shot task\nand a weighting term that controls the relative influence of task-specific\nnegatives and distractors. An important aspect of our finetuning objective is\nthat it is agnostic to distractor labels and hence applicable to various base\ndomain settings.

Moreover, our model can use\nany GNN as the molecule encoder and is thus agnostic to GNN architectures.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in a variety of downstream tasks, e.g., 17.4% absolute Hit@1 gain\nin chemical reaction prediction, 2.3% absolute AUC gain in molecule property\nprediction, and 18.5% relative RMSE gain in graph-edit-distance prediction,\nrespectively, over the best baseline method.

In this paper, we propose a simple yet\neffective anomaly detection framework for deep RL algorithms that\nsimultaneously considers random, adversarial and out-of-distribution~(OOD)\nstate outliers. In particular, we attain the class-conditional distributions\nfor each action class under the Gaussian assumption, and rely on these\ndistributions to discriminate between inliers and outliers based on Mahalanobis\nDistance~(MD) and Robust Mahalanobis Distance. We conduct extensive experiments\non Atari games that verify the effectiveness of our detection strategies. To\nthe best of our knowledge, we present the first in-detail study of statistical\nand adversarial anomaly detection in deep RL algorithms. This simple unified\nanomaly detection paves the way towards deploying safe RL systems in real-world\napplications.",

    "abstract": "Effective representation learning is critical for short text clustering due\nto the sparse, high-dimensional and noise attributes of short text corpus.\nExisting pre-trained models (e.g., Word2vec and BERT) have greatly improved the\nexpressiveness for short text representations with more condensed,\nlow-dimensional and continuous features compared to the traditional\nBag-of-Words (BoW) model. However, these models are trained for general\npurposes and thus are suboptimal for the short text clustering task. In this\npaper, we propose two methods to exploit the unsupervised autoencoder (AE)\nframework to further tune the short text representations based on these\npre-trained text models for optimal clustering performance. In our first method\nStructural Text Network Graph Autoencoder (STN-GAE), we exploit the structural\ntext information among the corpus by constructing a text network, and then\nadopt graph convolutional network as encoder to fuse the structural features\nwith the pre-trained text features for text representation learning. In our\nsecond method Soft Cluster Assignment Autoencoder (SCA-AE), we adopt an extra\nsoft cluster assignment constraint on the latent space of autoencoder to\nencourage the learned text representations to be more clustering-friendly. We\ntested two methods on seven popular short text datasets, and the experimental\nresults show that when only using the pre-trained model for short text\nclustering, BERT performs better than BoW and Word2vec. However, as long as we\nfurther tune the pre-trained representations, the proposed method like SCA-AE\ncan greatly increase the clustering performance, and the accuracy improvement\ncompared to use BERT alone could reach as much as 14\\%.",

As a\ncase in point, oscillator networks offer a potentially promising energy\nefficient and scalable option. However, prior oscillator-based combinatorial\noptimization solvers have primarily focused on quadratic combinatorial\noptimization problems that consider only pairwise interaction among the\noscillators. In this work, we propose a new computational model based on the\nmaximum entropy production (MEP) principle that exploits higher order\ninteractions among the oscillators, and demonstrate its application in solving\nthe non-quadratic maximum satisfiability (MaxSAT) problem. We demonstrate that\nthe solution to the MaxSAT problem can be directly mapped to the entropy\nproduction rate in the oscillator network, and subsequently, propose an\narea-efficient hardware implementation that leverages Compute-in-Memory (CiM)\nprimitives. Using experiments along with analytical and circuit simulations, we\nelucidate the performance of the proposed approach in computing high-quality\noptimal / near-optimal solutions to the MaxSAT problem.

While\nalternatives such as neuro-symbolic approaches have been proposed, there is a\nlack of consensus on what they are about. There are often two independent\nmotivations (i) symbols as a lingua franca for human-AI interaction and (ii)\nsymbols as (system-produced) abstractions use in its internal reasoning. The\njury is still out on whether AI systems will need to use symbols in their\ninternal reasoning to achieve general intelligence capabilities. Whatever the\nanswer there is, the need for (human-understandable) symbols in human-AI\ninteraction seems quite compelling. Symbols, like emotions, may well not be\nsine qua non for intelligence per se, but they will be crucial for AI systems\nto interact with us humans--as we can neither turn off our emotions nor get by\nwithout our symbols. In particular, in many human-designed domains, humans\nwould be interested in providing explicit (symbolic) knowledge and advice--and\nexpect machine explanations in kind. This alone requires AI systems to at least\ndo their I/O in symbolic terms.

We further propose a 3D point descriptor that\nis invariant to 3D reflection symmetry using the spectral properties of the\ngeodesic distance matrix constructed from the neighbors of a point. This helps\nus in decoupling the chicken-and-egg problem of finding optimal symmetry plane\nand correspondences between the reflective symmetric points. We show that the\nproposed approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the benchmarks\ndataset.",

    "abstract": "The verification of multimedia content over social media is one of the\nchallenging and crucial issues in the current scenario and gaining prominence\nin an age where user-generated content and online social web platforms are the\nleading sources in shaping and propagating news stories. As these sources allow\nusers to share their opinions without restriction, opportunistic users often\npost misleading/ unreliable content on social media such as Twitter, Facebook,\netc. At present, to lure users towards the news story, the text is often\nattached with some multimedia content (images/videos/audios). Verifying these\ncontents to maintain the credibility and reliability of social media\ninformation is of paramount importance. Motivated by this, we proposed a\ngeneralized system that supports the automatic classification of images into\ncredible or misleading. In this paper, we investigated machine learning-based\nas well as deep learning-based approaches utilized to verify misleading\nmultimedia content, where the available image traces are used to identify the\ncredibility of the content. The experiment is performed on the real-world\ndataset (Media-eval-2015 dataset) collected from Twitter. It also demonstrates\nthe efficiency of our proposed approach and features using both Machine and\nDeep Learning Model (Bi-directional LSTM). The experiment result reveals that\nthe Microsoft bings image search engine is quite effective in retrieving titles\nand performs better than our study's Google image search engine. It also shows\nthat gathering clues from attached multimedia content (image) is more effective\nthan detecting only posted content-based features.",

However, their \\emph{limited endurance} is still a major\ndrawback that has to be improved before they can be widely adapted in\nlarge-scale systems.\nIn this work, in order to reduce the wear out of the cells, we propose a new\ncoding scheme, called \\emph{endurance-limited memories} (\\emph{ELM}) codes,\nthat increases the endurance of these memories by limiting the number of cell\nprogramming operations. Namely, an \\emph{$\\ell$-change $t$-write ELM code} is a\ncoding scheme that allows to write $t$ messages into some $n$ binary cells\nwhile guaranteeing that each cell is programmed at most $\\ell$ times. In case\n$\\ell=1$, these codes coincide with the well-studied \\emph{write-once memory}\n(\\emph{WOM}) codes. We study some models of these codes which depend upon\nwhether the encoder knows on each write the number of times each cell was\nprogrammed, knows only the memory state, or even does not know anything. For\nthe decoder, we consider these similar three cases. We fully characterize the\ncapacity regions and the maximum sum-rates of three models where the encoder\nknows on each write the number of times each cell was programmed. In\nparticular, it is shown that in these models the maximum sum-rate is $\\log\n\\sum_{i=0}^{\\ell} {t \\choose i}$. We also study and expose the capacity regions\nof the models where the decoder is informed with the number of times each cell\nwas programmed. Finally we present the most practical model where the encoder\nread the memory before encoding new data and the decoder has no information\nabout the previous states of the memory.",

This way of fusion neglects the\nmulti-level spectral-spatial correlation between the two streams, which is\nvital to improving the fusion performance. In consideration of this, we propose\na Multi-level and Enhanced Spectral-Spatial Fusion Network (MESSFN) with the\nfollowing innovations: First, to fully exploit and strengthen the above\ncorrelation, a Hierarchical Multi-level Fusion Architecture (HMFA) is carefully\ndesigned. A novel Spectral-Spatial (SS) stream is established to hierarchically\nderive and fuse the multi-level prior spectral and spatial expertise from the\nMS stream and the PAN stream. This helps the SS stream master a joint\nspectral-spatial representation in the hierarchical network for better modeling\nthe fusion relationship. Second, to provide superior expertise, consequently,\nbased on the intrinsic characteristics of the MS image and the PAN image, two\nfeature extraction blocks are specially developed. In the MS stream, a Residual\nSpectral Attention Block (RSAB) is proposed to mine the potential spectral\ncorrelations between different spectra of the MS image through adjacent\ncross-spectrum interaction. While in the PAN stream, a Residual Multi-scale\nSpatial Attention Block (RMSAB) is proposed to capture multi-scale information\nand reconstruct precise high-frequency details from the PAN image through an\nimproved spatial attention-based inception structure. The spectral and spatial\nfeature representations are enhanced. Extensive experiments on two datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed network is competitive with or better than\nstate-of-the-art methods. Our code can be found in github.",

In this paper, inspired by\nthe thoughts of Shannon's information theory, the new system model introducing\nthe target existent state variable v into a general radar system model is\nestablished for target detection in the presence of complex white Gaussian\nnoise. The equivalent detection channel and the posterior probability\ndistribution are derived based on the priori statistical characteristic of the\nnoise, target scattering and existent state. The detection performance is\nmeasured by the false alarm and detection probabilities and the detection\ninformation that is defined as the mutual information between received signal\nand existent state. The false alarm theorem is proved that false alarm\nprobability is equal to the prior probability of the target existence if the\nobservation interval is large enough and the theorem is the basis for the\nperformance comparison proposed detector with Neyman-Person detector. The\nsampling a posterior probability detector is proposed, and its performance is\nmeasured by the empirical detection information. The target detection theorem\nis proved that the detection information is the limit of the detection\nperformance, that is, the detection information is achievable and the empirical\ndetection information of any detector is no greater than the detection\ninformation.

    "abstract": "Bitcoin's success as a cryptocurrency enabled it to penetrate into many daily\nlife transactions. Its problems regarding the transaction fees and long\nvalidation times are addressed through an innovative concept called the\nLightning Network (LN) which works on top of Bitcoin by leveraging off-chain\ntransactions. This made Bitcoin an attractive micro-payment solution that can\nalso be used within certain IoT applications (e.g., toll payments) since it\neliminates the need for traditional centralized payment systems. Nevertheless,\nit is not possible to run LN and Bitcoin on resource-constrained IoT devices\ndue to their storage, memory, and processing requirements. Therefore, in this\npaper, we propose an efficient and secure protocol that enables an IoT device\nto use LN's functions through a gateway LN node even if it is not trusted. The\nidea is to involve the IoT device only in signing operations, which is possible\nby replacing LN's original 2-of-2 multisignature channels with 3-of-3\nmultisignature channels. Once the gateway is delegated to open a channel for\nthe IoT device in a secure manner, our protocol enforces the gateway to request\nthe IoT device's cryptographic signature for all further operations on the\nchannel such as sending payments or closing the channel. LN's Bitcoin\ntransactions are revised to incorporate the 3-of-3 multisignature channels. In\naddition, we propose other changes to protect the IoT device's funds from\ngetting stolen in possible revoked state broadcast attempts. We evaluated the\nproposed protocol using a Raspberry Pi considering a toll payment scenario. Our\nresults show that timely payments can be sent and the computational and\ncommunication delays associated with the protocol are negligible.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we proposed a novel mutual consistency network (MC-Net+) to\neffectively exploit the unlabeled hard regions for semi-supervised medical\nimage segmentation. The MC-Net+ model is motivated by the observation that deep\nmodels trained with limited annotations are prone to output highly uncertain\nand easily mis-classified predictions in the ambiguous regions (e.g. adhesive\nedges or thin branches) for the image segmentation task. Leveraging these\nregion-level challenging samples can make the semi-supervised segmentation\nmodel training more effective. Therefore, our proposed MC-Net+ model consists\nof two new designs. First, the model contains one shared encoder and multiple\nsightly different decoders (i.e. using different up-sampling strategies). The\nstatistical discrepancy of multiple decoders' outputs is computed to denote the\nmodel's uncertainty, which indicates the unlabeled hard regions. Second, a new\nmutual consistency constraint is enforced between one decoder's probability\noutput and other decoders' soft pseudo labels. In this way, we minimize the\nmodel's uncertainty during training and force the model to generate invariant\nand low-entropy results in such challenging areas of unlabeled data, in order\nto learn a generalized feature representation. We compared the segmentation\nresults of the MC-Net+ with five state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches on\nthree public medical datasets.

In this paper, we address the MSVDA problem\nby proposing a novel Temporal Attentive Moment Alignment Network (TAMAN) which\naims for effective feature transfer by dynamically aligning both spatial and\ntemporal feature moments. TAMAN further constructs robust global temporal\nfeatures by attending to dominant domain-invariant local temporal features with\nhigh local classification confidence and low disparity between global and local\nfeature discrepancies. To facilitate future research on the MSVDA problem, we\nintroduce comprehensive benchmarks, covering extensive MSVDA scenarios.\nEmpirical results demonstrate a superior performance of the proposed TAMAN\nacross multiple MSVDA benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Smart Grids and Industry 4.0 (I4.0) are neither a dream nor a near-future\nthing anymore, rather it is happening now. The integration of more and more\nembedded systems and IoT devices is pushing smart grids and I4.0 forward at a\nbreakneck speed. To cope up with this, the modification of age-old SCADA\n(Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems in terms of\ndecentralization, near-real-time operation, security, and privacy is necessary.\nIn this context, blockchain technology has the potential of providing not only\nthese essential features of the data acquisition process of future SCADA\nsystems but also many other useful add-ons. On the other side, it is evident\nthat various type of security breach tends to take place more during any\neconomic turmoil. These can cause even more serious devastation to the global\neconomy and human life. Thus, it is necessary to make our industries robust,\nautomated, and resilient with secured and immutable data acquiring systems.\nThis paper deals with the implementation scopes of blockchain in the data\nacquisition part of SCADA systems in the area of the smart grid and I4.0. There\nare several consensus mechanisms to support blockchain integration in the field\nof cryptocurrencies, vehicular networks, healthcare systems, e-commerce, etc.\nBut little attention has been paid to developing efficient and\neasy-to-implement consensus mechanisms in the field of blockchain-enabled SCADA\nsystems. From this perspective, a novel consensus mechanism, which we call\nPoRCH (Proof of Random Count in Hashes), with a customized mining node\nselection scheme has been proposed in this paper. Also, a small-scale prototype\nof a blockchain-enabled data acquisition system has been developed. The\nperformance evaluation of the implemented prototype shows the benefits of\nblockchain technology.",

While a robot dynamics model may be\nobtained from first principles or learned from data, updating its parameters is\noften too slow for online adaptation to environment changes. This motivates the\nuse of machine learning techniques to learn disturbance descriptors from\ntrajectory data offline as well as the design of adaptive control to estimate\nand compensate the disturbances online. This paper develops adaptive geometric\ncontrol for rigid-body systems, such as ground, aerial, and underwater\nvehicles, that satisfy Hamilton's equations of motion over the SE(3) manifold.\nOur design consists of an offline system identification stage, followed by an\nonline adaptive control stage. In the first stage, we learn a Hamiltonian model\nof the system dynamics using a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE)\nnetwork trained from state-control trajectory data with different disturbance\nrealizations. The disturbances are modeled as a linear combination of nonlinear\ndescriptors. In the second stage, we design a trajectory tracking controller\nwith disturbance compensation from an energy-based perspective. An adaptive\ncontrol law is employed to adjust the disturbance model online proportional to\nthe geometric tracking errors on the SE(3) manifold. We verify our adaptive\ngeometric controller for trajectory tracking on a fully-actuated pendulum and\nan under-actuated quadrotor.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents fast non-sampling based methods to assess the risk for\ntrajectories of autonomous vehicles when probabilistic predictions of other\nagents' futures are generated by deep neural networks (DNNs). The presented\nmethods address a wide range of representations for uncertain predictions\nincluding both Gaussian and non-Gaussian mixture models to predict both agent\npositions and control inputs conditioned on the scene contexts. We show that\nthe problem of risk assessment when Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) of agent\npositions are learned can be solved rapidly to arbitrary levels of accuracy\nwith existing numerical methods. To address the problem of risk assessment for\nnon-Gaussian mixture models of agent position, we propose finding upper bounds\non risk using nonlinear Chebyshev's Inequality and sums-of-squares (SOS)\nprogramming; they are both of interest as the former is much faster while the\nlatter can be arbitrarily tight. These approaches only require higher order\nstatistical moments of agent positions to determine upper bounds on risk. To\nperform risk assessment when models are learned for agent control inputs as\nopposed to positions, we propagate the moments of uncertain control inputs\nthrough the nonlinear motion dynamics to obtain the exact moments of uncertain\nposition over the planning horizon. To this end, we construct deterministic\nlinear dynamical systems that govern the exact time evolution of the moments of\nuncertain position in the presence of uncertain control inputs. The presented\nmethods are demonstrated on realistic predictions from DNNs trained on the\nArgoverse and CARLA datasets and are shown to be effective for rapidly\nassessing the probability of low probability events.",

However, it has been brought to light that growth of Wikipedia is\nstagnating in terms of the number of editors that faces steady decline over\ntime.

    "abstract": "Predicting metrics associated with entities' transnational behavior within\npayment processing networks is essential for system monitoring. Multivariate\ntime series, aggregated from the past transaction history, can provide valuable\ninsights for such prediction. The general multivariate time series prediction\nproblem has been well studied and applied across several domains, including\nmanufacturing, medical, and entomology. However, new domain-related challenges\nassociated with the data such as concept drift and multi-modality have surfaced\nin addition to the real-time requirements of handling the payment transaction\ndata at scale. In this work, we study the problem of multivariate time series\nprediction for estimating transaction metrics associated with entities in the\npayment transaction database. We propose a model with five unique components to\nestimate the transaction metrics from multi-modality data. Four of these\ncomponents capture interaction, temporal, scale, and shape perspectives, and\nthe fifth component fuses these perspectives together. We also propose a hybrid\noffline/online training scheme to address concept drift in the data and fulfill\nthe real-time requirements. Combining the estimation model with a graphical\nuser interface, the prototype transaction metric estimation system has\ndemonstrated its potential benefit as a tool for improving a payment processing\ncompany's system monitoring capability.",

In this paper, we present a novel learned multi-modal\ntrajectory prediction architecture for automated driving. It achieves\nkinematically feasible predictions by casting the learning problem into the\nspace of accelerations and steering angles -- by performing action-space\nprediction, we can leverage valuable model knowledge. Additionally, the\ndimensionality of the action manifold is lower than that of the state manifold,\nwhose intrinsically correlated states are more difficult to capture in a\nlearned manner. For the purpose of action-space prediction, we present the\nsimple Feed-Forward Action-Space Prediction (FFW-ASP) architecture. Then, we\nbuild on this notion and introduce the novel Self-Supervised Action-Space\nPrediction (SSP-ASP) architecture that outputs future environment context\nfeatures in addition to trajectories. A key element in the self-supervised\narchitecture is that, based on an observed action history and past context\nfeatures, future context features are predicted prior to future trajectories.\nThe proposed methods are evaluated on real-world datasets containing urban\nintersections and roundabouts, and show accurate predictions, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art for kinematically feasible predictions in several prediction\nmetrics.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates model-order reduction methods for geometrically\nnonlinear structures. The parametrisation method of invariant manifolds is used\nand adapted to the case of mechanical systems expressed in the physical basis,\nso that the technique is directly applicable to problems discretised by the\nfinite element method. Two nonlinear mappings, respectively related to\ndisplacement and velocity, are introduced, and the link between the two is made\nexplicit at arbitrary order of expansion. The same development is performed on\nthe reduced-order dynamics which is computed at generic order following the\ndifferent styles of parametrisation. More specifically, three different styles\nare introduced and commented: the graph style, the complex normal form style\nand the real normal form style. These developments allow making better\nconnections with earlier works using these parametrisation methods. The\ntechnique is then applied to three different examples. A clamped-clamped arch\nwith increasing curvature is first used to show an example of a system with a\nsoftening behaviour turning to hardening at larger amplitudes, which can be\nreplicated with a single mode reduction. Secondly, the case of a cantilever\nbeam is investigated. It is shown that the invariant manifold of the first mode\nshows a folding point at large amplitudes which is not connected to an internal\nresonance. This exemplifies the failure of the graph style due to the folding\npoint, whereas the normal form style is able to pass over the folding. Finally,\nA MEMS micromirror undergoing large rotations is used to show the importance of\nusing high-order expansions on an industrial example.",

    "abstract": "Linearisation is often used as a first step in the analysis of nonlinear\ninitial boundary value problems. The linearisation procedure frequently results\nin a confusing contradiction where the nonlinear problem conserves energy and\nhas an energy bound but the linearised version does not (or vice versa). In\nthis paper we attempt to resolve that contradiction and relate nonlinear energy\nconserving and bounded initial boundary value problems to their linearised\nversions and the related dual problems. We start by showing that a specific\nskew-symmetric form of the primal nonlinear problem leads to energy\nconservation and a bound. Next, we show that this specific form together with a\nnon-standard linearisation procedure preserves these properties for the new\nslightly modified linearised problem. We proceed to show that the corresponding\nlinear and nonlinear dual (or self-adjoint) problems also have bounds and\nconserve energy due to this specific formulation. Next, the implication of the\nnew formulation on the choice of boundary conditions is discussed. A\nstraightforward nonlinear and linear analysis may lead to a different number\nand type of boundary conditions required for an energy bound. We show that the\nnew formulation shed some light on this contradiction. We conclude by\nillustrating that the new continuous formulation automatically lead to energy\nstable and energy conserving numerical approximations for both linear and\nnonlinear primal and dual problems if the approximations are formulated on\nsummation-by-parts form.",

    "title": "Graph Neural Networks for Graph Drawing",
    "abstract": "Graph Drawing techniques have been developed in the last few years with the\npurpose of producing aesthetically pleasing node-link layouts. Recently, the\nemployment of differentiable loss functions has paved the road to the massive\nusage of Gradient Descent and related optimization algorithms. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel framework for the development of Graph Neural Drawers (GND),\nmachines that rely on neural computation for constructing efficient and complex\nmaps. GND are Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) whose learning process can be driven\nby any provided loss function, such as the ones commonly employed in Graph\nDrawing. Moreover, we prove that this mechanism can be guided by loss functions\ncomputed by means of Feedforward Neural Networks, on the basis of supervision\nhints that express beauty properties, like the minimization of crossing edges.\nIn this context, we show that GNNs can nicely be enriched by positional\nfeatures to deal also with unlabelled vertexes. We provide a proof-of-concept\nby constructing a loss function for the edge-crossing and provide quantitative\nand qualitative comparisons among different GNN models working under the\nproposed framework.",

Using\nNntool by MATLAB, 22 different combinations of networks and training algorithms\nare used to predict the dimensions of a rectangular microstrip antenna using\ndielectric constant, height of substrate, and frequency of operation as input.\nComparison and characterization of networks is done based on accuracy, mean\nsquare error, and training time.

Server-side aggregation in our\nprotocol takes only 21 seconds for data received from 1,000,000 clients.\nFurthermore, it requires only a single message sent from each client to the\nuntrusted aggregation server (at most 129 bytes), and no interaction between\nclients. Additionally, STAR is extensible in that clients can send additional\ndata with their measurement, which is only revealed if the threshold check is\nsatisfied.\nThe STAR protocol supports multiple deployment scenarios. For instance, when\nclient inputs come from a highly entropic input distribution STAR requires only\na single untrusted server. When such guarantees cannot be made, STAR can be\ndeployed using a second non-colluding randomness server, to provide clients\nwith an outsourced method for generating shared randomness.\nFinally, this work makes novel cryptographic contributions in defining and\nconstructing puncturable partially oblivious PRF (PPOPRF) protocols, which we\nexpect to be useful in applications beyond STAR.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) as a feature\nencoder (or backbone) is the most commonly observed architectural pattern in\nseveral computer vision methods, and semantic segmentation is no exception. The\ntwo major drawbacks of this architectural pattern are: (i) the networks often\nfail to capture small classes such as wall, fence, pole, traffic light, traffic\nsign, and bicycle, which are crucial for autonomous vehicles to make accurate\ndecisions. (ii) due to the arbitrarily increasing depth, the networks require\nmassive labeled data and additional regularization techniques to converge and\nto prevent the risk of over-fitting, respectively. While regularization\ntechniques come at minimal cost, the collection of labeled data is an expensive\nand laborious process. In this work, we address these two drawbacks by\nproposing a novel lightweight architecture named point-wise dense flow network\n(PDFNet). In PDFNet, we employ dense, residual, and multiple shortcut\nconnections to allow a smooth gradient flow to all parts of the network. The\nextensive experiments on Cityscapes and CamVid benchmarks demonstrate that our\nmethod significantly outperforms baselines in capturing small classes and in\nfew-data regimes.

    "abstract": "Over the past years, topics ranging from climate change to human rights have\nseen increasing importance for investment decisions. Hence, investors (asset\nmanagers and asset owners) who wanted to incorporate these issues started to\nassess companies based on how they handle such topics. For this assessment,\ninvestors rely on specialized rating agencies that issue ratings along the\nenvironmental, social and governance (ESG) dimensions. Such ratings allow them\nto make investment decisions in favor of sustainability. However, rating\nagencies base their analysis on subjective assessment of sustainability\nreports, not provided by every company. Furthermore, due to human labor\ninvolved, rating agencies are currently facing the challenge to scale up the\ncoverage in a timely manner.\nIn order to alleviate these challenges and contribute to the overall goal of\nsupporting sustainability, we propose a heterogeneous ensemble model to predict\nESG ratings using fundamental data. This model is based on feedforward neural\nnetwork, CatBoost and XGBoost ensemble members. Given the public availability\nof fundamental data, the proposed method would allow cost-efficient and\nscalable creation of initial ESG ratings (also for companies without\nsustainability reporting).

Recent work has introduced methods for post-hoc\nconfidence calibration for classification as well as for object detection to\naddress this issue. Especially in safety critical applications, it is crucial\nto obtain a reliable self-assessment of a model. But what if the calibration\nmethod itself is uncertain, e.g., due to an insufficient knowledge base?\nWe introduce Bayesian confidence calibration - a framework to obtain\ncalibrated confidence estimates in conjunction with an uncertainty of the\ncalibration method. Commonly, Bayesian neural networks (BNN) are used to\nindicate a network's uncertainty about a certain prediction. BNNs are\ninterpreted as neural networks that use distributions instead of weights for\ninference. We transfer this idea of using distributions to confidence\ncalibration. For this purpose, we use stochastic variational inference to build\na calibration mapping that outputs a probability distribution rather than a\nsingle calibrated estimate. Using this approach, we achieve state-of-the-art\ncalibration performance for object detection calibration. Finally, we show that\nthis additional type of uncertainty can be used as a sufficient criterion for\ncovariate shift detection.

A spectral GCNN is not tailored to one specific graph and\ncan be transferred between different graphs.

In this paper, we consider a model of transferability based on\ngraphon analysis. Graphons are limit objects of graphs, and, in the graph\nparadigm, two graphs represent the same phenomenon if both approximate the same\ngraphon. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows: 1) we prove that\nany fixed GCNN with continuous filters is transferable under graphs that\napproximate the same graphon, 2) we prove transferability for graphs that\napproximate unbounded graphon shift operators, which are defined in this paper,\nand, 3) we obtain non-asymptotic approximation results, proving linear\nstability of GCNNs.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a distributed multi-stage optimization method for\nplanning complex missions for heterogeneous multi-robot teams. This class of\nproblems involves tasks that can be executed in different ways and are\nassociated with cross-schedule dependencies that constrain the schedules of the\ndifferent robots in the system. The proposed approach involves a\nmulti-objective heuristic search of the mission, represented as a hierarchical\ntree that defines the mission goal. This procedure outputs several favorable\nways to fulfill the mission, which directly feed into the next stage of the\nmethod. We propose a distributed metaheuristic based on evolutionary\ncomputation to allocate tasks and generate schedules for the set of chosen\ndecompositions. The method is evaluated in a simulation setup of an automated\ngreenhouse use case, where we demonstrate the method's ability to adapt the\nplanning strategy depending on the available robots and the given optimization\ncriteria.",

Specifically, we\nconsider the slowly fading scenario where the coherence block-length is large\ncompared to the number of active users and the message can be transmitted in\none coherence block. Unsourced random access refers to a form of grant-free\nrandom access where users are considered to be a-priori indistinguishable and\nthe receiver recovers a list of transmitted messages up to permutation. In this\nwork we show that, when the coherence block length is large enough, a\nconventional approach based on the transmission of non-orthogonal pilot\nsequences with subsequent channel estimation and Maximum-Ratio-Combining (MRC)\nprovides a simple energy-efficient solution whose performance can be well\napproximated in closed form. Furthermore, we analyse the MRC step when\nsuccessive interference cancellation (SIC) is done in groups, which allows to\nstrike a balance between receiver complexity and reduced transmit powers.\nFinally, we investigate the impact of power control policies taking into\naccount the unique nature of massive random access, including short message\nlengths, uncoordinated transmission, a very large amount of concurrent\ntransmitters with unknown identities, channel estimation errors and decoding\nerrors. As a byproduct we also present an extension of the MMV-AMP algorithm\nwhich allows to treat pathloss coefficients as deterministic unknowns by\nperforming maximum likelihood estimation in each step of the MMV-AMP algorithm.",

At the same time,\nmost description logics correspond to a fragment of $k$-variable counting logic\n($C_k$) for $k=2$, that has been shown to provide a tight characterization of\nthe expressive power of graph neural networks. In this work, we make use of\nthese results to understand the power and limits of using graph neural networks\n(GNNs) for learning optimal general policies over a number of tractable\nplanning domains where such policies are known to exist. For this, we train a\nsimple GNN in a supervised manner to approximate the optimal value function\n$V^{*}(s)$ of a number of sample states $s$. As predicted by the theory, it is\nobserved that general optimal policies are obtained in domains where general\noptimal value functions can be defined with $C_2$ features but not in those\nrequiring more expressive $C_3$ features. In addition, it is observed that the\nfeatures learned are in close correspondence with the features needed to\nexpress $V^{*}$ in closed form. The theory and the analysis of the domains let\nus understand the features that are actually learned as well as those that\ncannot be learned in this way, and let us move in a principled manner from a\ncombinatorial optimization approach to learning general policies to a\npotentially, more robust and scalable approach based on deep learning.",

Objective: To assess the quality of SLRs in software\nengineering, we put forward an appraisal instrument for SLRs.

Method: A\nwell-established appraisal instrument from research in healthcare was used as a\nstarting point to develop a quality assessment instrument.

Results: The outcome of the research is an appraisal instrument\nfor the quality assessment of SLRs in software engineering. The instrument\nintends to support the appraiser in assessing the quality of an SLR. The\ninstrument includes 16 items with different options to capture the quality. The\nitem is assessed on a two or three-grade scale, depending on the item. The\ninstrument also supports consolidating the items into groups, which are then\nused to assess the overall quality of a systematic literature review.\nConclusion: It is concluded that the presented instrument may be helpful\nsupport for an appraiser in assessing the quality of SLRs in software\nengineering.",

    "abstract": "Data augmentation can be a simple yet powerful tool for autonomous robots to\nfully utilise available data for self-supervised identification of atypical\nscenes or objects. State-of-the-art augmentation methods arbitrarily embed\nstructural peculiarity in focal objects on typical images so that classifying\nthese artefacts can provide guidance for learning representations for the\ndetection of anomalous visual inputs. In this paper, however, we argue that\nlearning such structure-sensitive representations can be a suboptimal approach\nto some classes of anomaly (e.g., unhealthy fruits) which are better recognised\nby a different type of visual element such as \"colour\". We thus propose Channel\nRandomisation as a novel data augmentation method for restricting neural\nnetwork models to learn encoding of \"colour irregularity\" whilst predicting\nchannel-randomised images to ultimately build reliable fruit-monitoring robots\nidentifying atypical fruit qualities. Our experiments show that (1) the\ncolour-based alternative can better learn representations for consistently\naccurate identification of fruit anomalies in various fruit species, and (2)\nvalidation accuracy can be monitored for early stopping of training due to\npositive correlation between the colour-learning task and fruit anomaly\ndetection. Moreover, the proposed approach is evaluated on a new anomaly\ndataset Riseholme-2021, consisting of 3:5K strawberry images collected from a\nmobile robot, which we share with the community to encourage active\nagri-robotics research.",

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can improve the capacity of the\nwireless communication system by providing the extra link between the base\nstation (BS) and the user. In order to resist the \"multiplicative fading\"\neffect, RIS is more likely to develop into extremely large-scale RIS (XL-RIS)\nfor future 6G communications. Beam training is an effective way to acquire\nchannel state information (CSI) for the XL-RIS assisted system. Existing beam\ntraining schemes rely on the far-field codebook, which is designed based on the\nfar-field channel model. However, due to the large aperture of XL-RIS, the user\nis more likely to be in the near-field region of XL-RIS. The far-field codebook\nmismatches the near-field channel model. Thus, the existing far-field beam\ntraining scheme will cause severe performance loss in the XL-RIS assisted\nnear-field communications. To solve this problem, we propose the efficient\nnear-field beam training schemes by designing the near-field codebook to match\nthe near-field channel model. Specifically, we firstly design the near-field\ncodebook by considering the near-field cascaded array steering vector of\nXL-RIS. Then, the optimal codeword for XL-RIS is obtained by the exhausted\ntraining procedure between the XL-RIS and the user. In order to reduce the beam\ntraining overhead, we further design a hierarchical near-field codebook and\npropose the corresponding hierarchical near-field beam training scheme, where\ndifferent levels of sub-codebooks are searched in turn with reduced codebook\nsize. Simulation results show the two proposed near-field beam training schemes\nboth perform better than the existing far-field beam training scheme.\nParticulary, the hierarchical near-field beam training scheme can greatly\nreduce the beam training overhead with acceptable performance loss.",

    "title": "A Variability Fault Localization Approach for Software Product Lines",
    "abstract": "Software fault localization is one of the most expensive, tedious, and\ntime-consuming activities in program debugging. This activity becomes even much\nmore challenging in Software Product Line (SPL) systems due to variability of\nfailures. These unexpected behaviors are induced by variability faults which\ncan only be exposed under some combinations of system features. The interaction\namong these features causes the failures of the system. Although localizing\nbugs in single-system engineering has been studied in-depth, variability fault\nlocalization in SPL systems still remains mostly unexplored. In this article,\nwe present VarCop, a novel and effective variability fault localization\napproach. For an SPL system failed by variability bugs, VarCop isolates\nsuspicious code statements by analyzing the overall test results of the sampled\nproducts and their source code. The isolated suspicious statements are the\nstatements related to the interaction among the features which are necessary\nfor the visibility of the bugs in the system. The suspiciousness of each\nisolated statement is assessed based on both the overall test results of the\nproducts containing the statement as well as the detailed results of the test\ncases executed by the statement in these products. On a large dataset of buggy\nSPL systems, empirical evaluation shows that VarCop significantly improves two\nstate-of-the-art fault localization techniques by 33% and 50% in ranking the\nincorrect statements in the systems containing a single bug each. In about\ntwo-thirds of the cases, VarCop ranks the buggy statements at the top-3\npositions in the resulting lists. For multiple-bug cases, VarCop outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art approaches 2 times and 10 times in the proportion of bugs\nlocalized at the top-1 positions. In 22% and 65% of the buggy versions, VarCop\ncorrectly ranks at least one bug in a system at the top-1 and top-5 positions.",

    "abstract": "With the popularity of 3D sensors in self-driving and other robotics\napplications, extensive research has focused on designing novel neural network\narchitectures for accurate 3D point cloud completion. However, unlike in point\ncloud classification and reconstruction, the role of adversarial samples in3D\npoint cloud completion has seldom been explored. In this work, we show that\ntraining with adversarial samples can improve the performance of neural\nnetworks on 3D point cloud completion tasks. We propose a novel approach to\ngenerate adversarial samples that benefit both the performance of clean and\nadversarial samples. In contrast to the PGD-k attack, our method generates\nadversarial samples that keep the geometric features in clean samples and\ncontain few outliers. In particular, we use principal directions to constrain\nthe adversarial perturbations for each input point. The gradient components in\nthe mean direction of principal directions are taken as adversarial\nperturbations. In addition, we also investigate the effect of using the minimum\ncurvature direction. Besides, we adopt attack strength accumulation and\nauxiliary Batch Normalization layers method to speed up the training process\nand alleviate the distribution mismatch between clean and adversarial samples.\nExperimental results show that training with the adversarial samples crafted by\nour method effectively enhances the performance of PCN on the ShapeNet dataset.",

Mesh adaptivity naturally suggests itself as a means of supplying\nspatial resolution were needed while simultaneously keeping the computational\nsize of the model as small as possible.

    "abstract": "Rotated object detection is a challenging task in aerial images as the object\nin aerial images are displayed in arbitrary directions and usually densely\npacked. Although considerable progress has been made, there are still\nchallenges that existing regression-based rotation detectors suffer the problem\nof discontinuous boundaries, which is directly caused by angular periodicity or\ncorner ordering. In this paper, we propose a simple effective framework to\naddress the above challenges. Instead of directly regressing the five\nparameters (coordinates of the central point, width, height, and rotation\nangle) or the four vertices, we use the area ratio of parallelogram (ARP) to\naccurately describe a multi-oriented object. Specifically, we regress\ncoordinates of center point, height and width of minimum circumscribed\nrectangle of oriented object and three area ratios {\\lambda}_1, {\\lambda}_2 and\n{\\lambda}_3. This may facilitate the offset learning and avoid the issue of\nangular periodicity or label points sequence for oriented objects. To further\nremedy the confusion issue nearly horizontal objects, we employ the area ratio\nbetween the object and its horizontal bounding box (minimum circumscribed\nrectangle) to guide the selection of horizontal or oriented detection for each\nobject. We also propose a rotation efficient IoU loss (R-EIoU) to connect the\nhorizontal bounding box with the three area ratios and improve the accurate for\nthe rotating bounding box. Experimental results on three remote sensing\ndatasets including HRSC2016, DOTA and UCAS-AOD and scene text including\nICDAR2015 show that our method achieves superior detection performance compared\nwith many state-of-the-art approaches.

    "abstract": "In this note, a novel methodology that can extract a number of analysis\nresults for linear time-invariant systems (LTI) given only a single trajectory\nof the considered system is proposed. The superiority of the proposed technique\nrelies on the fact that it provides an automatic and formal way to obtain\nvaluable information about the controlled system by only having access to a\nsingle trajectory over a finite period of time (i.e., the system dynamics is\nassumed to be unknown). At first, we characterize the stability region of LTI\nsystems given only a single trajectory dataset by constructing the associated\nLyapunov function of the system. The Lyapunov function is found by formulating\nand solving a linear programming (LP) problem. Then, we extend the same\nmethodology to a variety of essential analysis results for LTI systems such as\nderiving bounds on the output energy, deriving bounds on output peak, deriving\n$\\mathbf{L}_2$ and RMS gains. To illustrate the efficacy of the proposed\ndata-driven paradigm, a comparison analysis between the learned LTI system\nmetrics and the true ones is provided.",

    "abstract": "The great promises of neuromorphic sensing and processing for robotics have\nled researchers and engineers to investigate novel models for robust and\nreliable control of autonomous robots (navigation, obstacle detection and\navoidance, etc.), especially for quadrotors in challenging contexts such as\ndrone racing and aggressive maneuvers. Using spiking neural networks, these\nmodels can be run on neuromorphic hardware to benefit from outstanding update\nrates and high energy efficiency. Yet, low-level controllers are often\nneglected and remain outside of the neuromorphic loop. Designing low-level\nneuromorphic controllers is crucial to remove the standard PID, and therefore\nbenefit from all the advantages of closing the neuromorphic loop. In this\npaper, we propose a parsimonious and adjustable neuromorphic PID controller,\nendowed with a minimal number of 93 neurons sparsely connected to achieve\nautonomous, onboard altitude control of a quadrotor equipped with Intel's Loihi\nneuromorphic chip. We successfully demonstrate the robustness of our proposed\nnetwork in a set of experiments where the quadrotor is requested to reach a\ntarget altitude from take-off.

    "abstract": "This paper considers large-scale linear stochastic systems representing,\ne.g., spatially discretized stochastic partial differential equations. Since\nasymptotic stability can often not be ensured in such a stochastic setting\n(e.g. due to larger noise), the main focus is on establishing model order\nreduction (MOR) schemes applicable to unstable systems. MOR is vital to reduce\nthe dimension of the problem in order to lower the enormous computational\ncomplexity of for instance sampling methods in high dimensions. In particular,\na new type of Gramian-based MOR approach is proposed in this paper that can be\nused in very general settings. The considered Gramians are constructed to\nidentify dominant subspaces of the stochastic system as pointed out in this\nwork. Moreover, they can be computed via Lyapunov equations. However,\ncovariance information of the underlying systems enters these equations which\nis not directly available. Therefore, efficient sampling based methods relying\non variance reduction techniques are established to derive the required\ncovariances and hence the Gramians. Alternatively, an ansatz to compute the\nGramians by deterministic approximations of covariance functions is\ninvestigated. An error bound for the studied MOR methods is proved yielding an\na-priori criterion for the choice of the reduced system dimension. This bound\nis new and beneficial even in the deterministic case. The paper is concluded by\nnumerical experiments showing the efficiently of the proposed MOR schemes.",

Previous experience is summarised in a lazy graph structure,\nand LTR* is formulated such that it is robust and beneficial regardless of the\nextent of changes in the workspace. Our hybrid approach attains a faster speed\nin obtaining an initial solution than existing roadmap-based planners and often\nwith a lower cost in trajectory length. Subsequent tasks can utilise the lazy\nexperience graph to speed up finding a solution and take advantage of the\noptimised graph to minimise the cost objective.

    "abstract": "In many fields of science and engineering, models with different fidelities\nare available. Physical experiments or detailed simulations that accurately\ncapture the behavior of the system are regarded as high-fidelity models with\nlow model uncertainty, however, they are expensive to run. On the other hand,\nsimplified physical experiments or numerical models are seen as low-fidelity\nmodels that are cheaper to evaluate. Although low-fidelity models are often not\nsuitable for direct use in reliability analysis due to their low accuracy, they\ncan offer information about the trend of the high-fidelity model thus providing\nthe opportunity to explore the design space at a low cost. This study presents\na new approach called adaptive multi-fidelity Gaussian process for reliability\nanalysis (AMGPRA). Contrary to selecting training points and information\nsources in two separate stages as done in state-of-the-art mfEGRA method, the\nproposed approach finds the optimal training point and information source\nsimultaneously using the novel collective learning function (CLF). CLF is able\nto assess the global impact of a candidate training point from an information\nsource and it accommodates any learning function that satisfies a certain\nprofile. In this context, CLF provides a new direction for quantifying the\nimpact of new training points and can be easily extended with new learning\nfunctions to adapt to different reliability problems. The performance of the\nproposed method is demonstrated by three mathematical examples and one\nengineering problem concerning the wind reliability of transmission towers. It\nis shown that the proposed method achieves similar or higher accuracy with\nreduced computational costs compared to state-of-the-art single and\nmulti-fidelity methods. A key application of AMGPRA is high-fidelity fragility\nmodeling using complex and costly physics-based computational models.",

A\ndiscretization of a macroscopic traffic flow model (using the so-called Traffic\nReaction Model) is embedded in the architecture of the network and yields flux\npredictions based on estimated and predicted space-time dependent traffic\nparameters. These parameters are themselves obtained using a succession of LSTM\nans simple recurrent neural networks. Besides, on top of the predictions, the\nalgorithm yields a smoothing of its inputs which is also physically-constrained\nby the macroscopic traffic flow model. The algorithm is tested on raw flux\nmeasurements obtained from loop detectors.",

    "title": "Multi-Task Learning with Sentiment, Emotion, and Target Detection to  Recognize Hate Speech and Offensive Language",
    "abstract": "The recognition of hate speech and offensive language (HOF) is commonly\nformulated as a classification task to decide if a text contains HOF. We\ninvestigate whether HOF detection can profit by taking into account the\nrelationships between HOF and similar concepts: (a) HOF is related to sentiment\nanalysis because hate speech is typically a negative statement and expresses a\nnegative opinion; (b) it is related to emotion analysis, as expressed hate\npoints to the author experiencing (or pretending to experience) anger while the\naddressees experience (or are intended to experience) fear. (c) Finally, one\nconstituting element of HOF is the mention of a targeted person or group. On\nthis basis, we hypothesize that HOF detection shows improvements when being\nmodeled jointly with these concepts, in a multi-task learning setup. We base\nour experiments on existing data sets for each of these concepts (sentiment,\nemotion, target of HOF) and evaluate our models as a participant (as team\nIMS-SINAI) in the HASOC FIRE 2021 English Subtask 1A. Based on model-selection\nexperiments in which we consider multiple available resources and submissions\nto the shared task, we find that the combination of the CrowdFlower emotion\ncorpus, the SemEval 2016 Sentiment Corpus, and the OffensEval 2019 target\ndetection data leads to an F1 =.79 in a multi-head multi-task learning model\nbased on BERT, in comparison to .7895 of plain BERT. On the HASOC 2019 test\ndata, this result is more substantial with an increase by 2pp in F1 and a\nconsiderable increase in recall. Across both data sets (2019, 2021), the recall\nis particularly increased for the class of HOF (6pp for the 2019 data and 3pp\nfor the 2021 data), showing that MTL with emotion, sentiment, and target\nidentification is an appropriate approach for early warning systems that might\nbe deployed in social media platforms.",

    "abstract": "Several applications such as autonomous driving, augmented reality and\nvirtual reality requires a precise prediction of the 3D human pose. Recently, a\nnew problem was introduced in the field to predict the 3D human poses from an\nobserved 2D poses. We propose Skeleton-Graph, a deep spatio-temporal graph CNN\nmodel that predicts the future 3D skeleton poses in a single pass from the 2D\nones. Unlike prior works, Skeleton-Graph focuses on modeling the interaction\nbetween the skeleton joints by exploiting their spatial configuration. This is\nbeing achieved by formulating the problem as a graph structure while learning a\nsuitable graph adjacency kernel. By the design, Skeleton-Graph predicts the\nfuture 3D poses without divergence on the long-term unlike prior works. We also\nintroduce a new metric that measures the divergence of predictions on the\nlong-term. Our results show an FDE improvement of at least 27% and an ADE of 4%\non both the GTA-IM and PROX datasets respectively in comparison with prior\nworks. Also, we are 88% and 93% less divergence on the long-term motion\nprediction in comparison with prior works on both GTA-IM and PROX datasets.\nhttps://github.com/abduallahmohamed/Skeleton-Graph.git",

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning has been widely applied to graph representation\nlearning, where the view generators play a vital role in generating effective\ncontrastive samples. Most of the existing contrastive learning methods employ\npre-defined view generation methods, e.g., node drop or edge perturbation,\nwhich usually cannot adapt to input data or preserve the original semantic\nstructures well. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework named\nAutomated Graph Contrastive Learning (AutoGCL) in this paper. Specifically,\nAutoGCL employs a set of learnable graph view generators orchestrated by an\nauto augmentation strategy, where every graph view generator learns a\nprobability distribution of graphs conditioned by the input. While the graph\nview generators in AutoGCL preserve the most representative structures of the\noriginal graph in generation of every contrastive sample, the auto augmentation\nlearns policies to introduce adequate augmentation variances in the whole\ncontrastive learning procedure. Furthermore, AutoGCL adopts a joint training\nstrategy to train the learnable view generators, the graph encoder, and the\nclassifier in an end-to-end manner, resulting in topological heterogeneity yet\nsemantic similarity in the generation of contrastive samples. Extensive\nexperiments on semi-supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and transfer\nlearning demonstrate the superiority of our AutoGCL framework over the\nstate-of-the-arts in graph contrastive learning. In addition, the visualization\nresults further confirm that the learnable view generators can deliver more\ncompact and semantically meaningful contrastive samples compared against the\nexisting view generation methods.",

Personalized prediction of the changes in\nADAS-Cog scores could help in timing therapeutic interventions in dementia and\nat-risk populations. In the present work, we compared single and multitask\nlearning approaches to predict the changes in ADAS-Cog scores based on\nT1-weighted anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In contrast to most\nmachine learning-based prediction methods ADAS-Cog changes, we stratified the\nsubjects based on their baseline diagnoses and evaluated the prediction\nperformances in each group. Our experiments indicated a positive relationship\nbetween the predicted and observed ADAS-Cog score changes in each diagnostic\ngroup, suggesting that T1-weighted MRI has a predictive value for evaluating\ncognitive decline in the entire AD continuum. We further studied whether\ncorrection of the differences in the magnetic field strength of MRI would\nimprove the ADAS-Cog score prediction. The partial least square-based domain\nadaptation slightly improved the prediction performance, but the improvement\nwas marginal. In summary, this study demonstrated that ADAS-Cog change could\nbe, to some extent, predicted based on anatomical MRI. Based on this study, the\nrecommended method for learning the predictive models is a single-task\nregularized linear regression due to its simplicity and good performance.

Our system allows the dynamic creation of\nblockchains, as more participants join the system, to meet practical\nscalability requirements. Crucially, it enables the division of an existing\nblockchain (and its participants) into two -- reminiscent of mitosis, the\nbiological process of cell division. MITOSIS inherits the low latency of\npermissioned blockchains while preserving high throughput via parallel\nprocessing. Newly created chains in our system are fully autonomous, can choose\ntheir own consensus protocol, and yet they can interact with each other to\nshare information and assets -- meeting high levels of interoperability. We\nanalyse the security of MITOSIS and evaluate experimentally the performance of\nour solution when instantiated over Hyperledger Fabric. Our results show that\nMITOSIS can be ported with little modifications and manageable overhead to\nexisting permissioned blockchains, such as Hyperledger Fabric.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of learning a repertoire of low-level\nskills from raw images that can be sequenced to complete long-horizon\nvisuomotor tasks. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach for\nacquiring short-horizon skills autonomously. However, the focus of RL\nalgorithms has largely been on the success of those individual skills, more so\nthan learning and grounding a large repertoire of skills that can be sequenced\nto complete extended multi-stage tasks. The latter demands robustness and\npersistence, as errors in skills can compound over time, and may require the\nrobot to have a number of primitive skills in its repertoire, rather than just\none. To this end, we introduce EMBR, a model-based RL method for learning\nprimitive skills that are suitable for completing long-horizon visuomotor\ntasks. EMBR learns and plans using a learned model, critic, and success\nclassifier, where the success classifier serves both as a reward function for\nRL and as a grounding mechanism to continuously detect if the robot should\nretry a skill when unsuccessful or under perturbations. Further, the learned\nmodel is task-agnostic and trained using data from all skills, enabling the\nrobot to efficiently learn a number of distinct primitives. These visuomotor\nprimitive skills and their associated pre- and post-conditions can then be\ndirectly combined with off-the-shelf symbolic planners to complete long-horizon\ntasks. On a Franka Emika robot arm, we find that EMBR enables the robot to\ncomplete three long-horizon visuomotor tasks at 85% success rate, such as\norganizing an office desk, a file cabinet, and drawers, which require\nsequencing up to 12 skills, involve 14 unique learned primitives, and demand\ngeneralization to novel objects.",

    "abstract": "Vertex Integrity is a graph measure which sits squarely between two more\nwell-studied notions, namely vertex cover and tree-depth, and that has recently\ngained attention as a structural graph parameter. In this paper we investigate\nthe algorithmic trade-offs involved with this parameter from the point of view\nof algorithmic meta-theorems for First-Order (FO) and Monadic Second Order\n(MSO) logic. Our positive results are the following: (i) given a graph $G$ of\nvertex integrity $k$ and an FO formula $\\phi$ with $q$ quantifiers, deciding if\n$G$ satisfies $\\phi$ can be done in time $2^{O(k^2q+q\\log q)}+n^{O(1)}$; (ii)\nfor MSO formulas with $q$ quantifiers, the same can be done in time\n$2^{2^{O(k^2+kq)}}+n^{O(1)}$. Both results are obtained using kernelization\narguments, which pre-process the input to sizes $2^{O(k^2)}q$ and\n$2^{O(k^2+kq)}$ respectively.\nThe complexities of our meta-theorems are significantly better than the\ncorresponding meta-theorems for tree-depth, which involve towers of\nexponentials. However, they are worse than the roughly $2^{O(kq)}$ and\n$2^{2^{O(k+q)}}$ complexities known for corresponding meta-theorems for vertex\ncover. To explain this deterioration we present two formula constructions which\nlead to fine-grained complexity lower bounds and establish that the dependence\nof our meta-theorems on $k$ is best possible. More precisely, we show that it\nis not possible to decide FO formulas with $q$ quantifiers in time\n$2^{o(k^2q)}$, and that there exists a constant-size MSO formula which cannot\nbe decided in time $2^{2^{o(k^2)}}$, both under the ETH.

The reconstruction model is designed to learn a regularization that\ncombines channels and extracts features by leveraging the information sharing\namong channels of multi-coil images.

Methods: We develop a novel variational\nmodel with a learnable objective function that integrates an adaptive\nmulti-coil image combination operator and effective image regularization in the\nimage and Fourier spaces.

We use\n2,000 state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations from the CAMELS project\nspanning a wide variety of cosmological and astrophysical models and generate\nhundreds of thousands of 2-dimensional maps for 13 different fields: from dark\nmatter to gas and stellar properties. We use these maps to train convolutional\nneural networks to extract the maximum amount of cosmological information while\nmarginalizing over astrophysical effects at the field level. Although our maps\nonly cover a small area of $(25~h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc})^2$, and the different fields\nare contaminated by astrophysical effects in very different ways, our networks\ncan infer the values of $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ and $\\sigma_8$ with a few percent\nlevel precision for most of the fields. We find that the marginalization\nperformed by the network retains a wealth of cosmological information compared\nto a model trained on maps from gravity-only N-body simulations that are not\ncontaminated by astrophysical effects. Finally, we train our networks on\nmultifields -- 2D maps that contain several fields as different colors or\nchannels -- and find that not only they can infer the value of all parameters\nwith higher accuracy than networks trained on individual fields, but they can\nconstrain the value of $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ with higher accuracy than the maps from\nthe N-body simulations.",

In the context of a pandemic, the\ninteraction between vaccination policies adopted by multiple agents and the\ncooperation (or lack thereof) creates a complex environment that affects the\nglobal transmission dynamics of the disease. In this study, we take the\nperspective of decision-making agents that aim to minimize the size of their\nsusceptible populations and must allocate vaccine under limited supply. We\nassume that vaccine efficiency rates are unknown to agents and we propose an\noptimization policy based on Thompson sampling to learn mean vaccine efficiency\nrates over time. Furthermore, we develop a budget-balanced resource sharing\nmechanism to promote cooperation among agents. We apply the proposed framework\nto the COVID-19 pandemic. We use a raster model of the world where agents\nrepresent the main countries worldwide and interact in a global mobility\nnetwork to generate multiple problem instances. Our numerical results show that\nthe proposed vaccine allocation policy achieves a larger reduction in the\nnumber of susceptible individuals, infections and deaths globally compared to a\npopulation-based policy. In addition, we show that, under a fixed global\nvaccine allocation budget, most countries can reduce their national number of\ninfections and deaths by sharing their budget with countries with which they\nhave a relatively high mobility exchange.

In particular,\npotential customers are not restricted to a predefined customer set but are\ncontinuously spatially distributed in a given service area. The objective is to\nmaximize the served demands while fulfilling vehicle capacities and time\nrestrictions. We call this problem the VRP with stochastic customers and\ndemands (VRPSCD). For this problem, we first propose a Markov Decision Process\n(MDP) formulation representing the classical centralized decision-making\nperspective where one decision-maker establishes the routes of all vehicles.\nWhile the resulting formulation turns out to be intractable, it provides us\nwith the ground to develop a new MDP formulation of the VRPSCD representing a\ndecentralized decision-making framework, where vehicles autonomously establish\ntheir own routes. This new formulation allows us to develop several strategies\nto reduce the dimension of the state and action spaces, resulting in a\nconsiderably more tractable problem. We solve the decentralized problem via\nReinforcement Learning, and in particular, we develop a Q-learning algorithm\nfeaturing state-of-the-art acceleration techniques such as Replay Memory and\nDouble Q Network. Computational results show that our method considerably\noutperforms two commonly adopted benchmark policies (random and heuristic).\nMoreover, when comparing with existing literature, we show that our approach\ncan compete with specialized methods developed for the particular case of the\nVRPSCD where customer locations and expected demands are known in advance.\nFinally, we show that the value functions and policies obtained by our\nalgorithm can be easily embedded in Rollout algorithms, thus further improving\ntheir performances.",

This work aims to improve this situation by first, establishing an\nopen, and clinically validated dataset comprising data from both mechanical\nlungs and nearly 40,000 breaths from 18 intubated patients. Next, we use this\ndata to evaluate 15 different algorithms that use the \"single chamber\" model of\nestimating respiratory compliance. We evaluate these algorithms under varying\nclinical scenarios patients typically experience during hospitalization. In\nparticular, we explore algorithm performance under four different types of\npatient ventilator asynchrony. We also analyze algorithms under varying\nventilation modes to benchmark algorithm performance and to determine if\nventilation mode has any impact on the algorithm. Our approach yields several\nadvances by 1) showing which specific algorithms work best clinically under\nvarying mode and asynchrony scenarios, 2) developing a simple mathematical\nmethod to reduce variance in algorithmic results, and 3) presenting additional\ninsights about single-chamber model algorithms. We hope that our paper,\napproach, dataset, and software framework can thus be used by future\nresearchers to improve their work and allow future integration of \"single\nchamber\" algorithms into clinical practice.",

    "title": "Discovery of temporal structure intricacy in arterial blood pressure  waveforms representing acuity of liver transplant and forecasting short term  surgical outcome via unsupervised manifold learning",
    "abstract": "Background: Arterial blood pressure (ABP) waveform evolves across each\nconsecutive pulse during the liver transplant surgery. We hypothesized that the\nquantification of the waveform evolution reflects 1) the acuity of the\nrecipient undergoing liver transplant and 2) the intraoperative dynamics that\nforecasts short-term surgical outcomes. Methods: In this prospective\nobservational single cohort study on living donor liver transplant surgery, we\nextracted the waveform morphological evolution from the ABP data with the\nunsupervised manifold learning waveform analysis. Two quantitative indices,\ntrend movement and fluctuation movement, were developed to represent the\nslow-varying and fast-varying dynamics respectively. We investigated the\nassociations with the liver disease acuity represented with the Model for\nEnd-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score and the primary outcomes, the early\nallograft failure (EAF), as well as the recently developed EAF scores,\nincluding the Liver Graft Assessment Following Transplantation (L-GrAFT) score,\nthe Early Allograft Failure Simplified Estimation (EASE) score, and the Model\nfor Early Allograft Function (MEAF) score. Results: Sixty recipients were\nenrolled. The presurgical trend movement was correlated with the MELD scores.\nIt decreased in the anhepatic phase. The neohepatic trend movement correlated\nwith the L-GrAFT scores, the EASE score, and the MEAF score. Regarding the\nconstituent of the EAF scores, the trend movement most correlated with the\npostoperative day 7 bilirubin. Conclusions: The ABP waveform evolution\nintricacy in the presurgical phase reflects recipients' acuity condition while\nthat in the neohepatic phase reveal the short-term surgical outcome calculated\nfrom laboratory data in postoperative day 7-10. The waveform evolution reflects\nthe intraoperative contribution to the early outcome.",

We use this operator to generalize\nseveral optimization algorithms, including a straightforward generalization of\ngradient descent and a novel generalization of Newton's method. We then explore\nwhich properties of these algorithms are preserved in this generalized setting.\nFirst, we show that the transformation invariances of these algorithms are\npreserved: while generalized Newton's method is invariant to all invertible\nlinear transformations, generalized gradient descent is invariant only to\northogonal linear transformations. Next, we show that we can express the change\nin loss of generalized gradient descent with an inner product-like expression,\nthereby generalizing the non-increasing and convergence properties of the\ngradient descent optimization flow. Finally, we include several numerical\nexperiments to illustrate the ideas in the paper and demonstrate how we can use\nthem to optimize polynomial functions over an ordered ring.",

    "abstract": "Directed networks appear in various areas, such as biology, sociology,\nphysiology and computer science. However, at present, most network analysis\nignores the direction. In this paper, we construct a spectral clustering method\nbased on the singular decomposition of the adjacency matrix to detect community\nin directed stochastic block model (DiSBM). By considering a sparsity\nparameter, under some mild conditions, we show the proposed approach can\nconsistently recover hidden row and column communities for different scaling of\ndegrees.\nBy considering the degree heterogeneity of both row and column nodes, we\nfurther establish a theoretical framework for directed degree corrected\nstochastic block model (DiDCSBM). We show that the spectral clustering method\nstably yields consistent community detection for row clusters and column\nclusters under mild constraints on the degree heterogeneity. Our theoretical\nresults under DiSBM and DiDCSBM provide some innovations on some special\ndirected networks, such as directed network with balanced clusters, directed\nnetwork with nodes enjoying similar degrees, and the directed Erd\\\"os-R\\'enyi\ngraph. Furthermore, our theoretical results under DiDCSBM are consistent with\nthose under DiSBM when DiDCSBM degenerates to DiSBM.",
