    "abstract": "Recurrent Neural Networks with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) make use of\ngating mechanisms to mitigate exploding and vanishing gradients when learning\nlong-term dependencies. For this reason, LSTMs and other gated RNNs are widely\nadopted, being the standard de facto for many sequence modeling tasks. Although\nthe memory cell inside the LSTM contains essential information, it is not\nallowed to influence the gating mechanism directly. In this work, we improve\nthe gate potential by including information coming from the internal cell\nstate. The proposed modification, named Working Memory Connection, consists in\nadding a learnable nonlinear projection of the cell content into the network\ngates. This modification can fit into the classical LSTM gates without any\nassumption on the underlying task, being particularly effective when dealing\nwith longer sequences. Previous research effort in this direction, which goes\nback to the early 2000s, could not bring a consistent improvement over vanilla\nLSTM. As part of this paper, we identify a key issue tied to previous\nconnections that heavily limits their effectiveness, hence preventing a\nsuccessful integration of the knowledge coming from the internal cell state. We\nshow through extensive experimental evaluation that Working Memory Connections\nconstantly improve the performance of LSTMs on a variety of tasks. Numerical\nresults suggest that the cell state contains useful information that is worth\nincluding in the gate structure.",

Although very useful in many applications,\nthe traditional approaches for generating word embeddings have a strict\ndrawback: they produce a single vector representation for a given word ignoring\nthe fact that ambiguous words can assume different meanings. In this paper, we\nexplore unsupervised sense representations which, different from traditional\nword embeddings, are able to induce different senses of a word by analyzing its\ncontextual semantics in a text. The unsupervised sense representations\ninvestigated in this paper are: sense embeddings and deep neural language\nmodels. We present the first experiments carried out for generating sense\nembeddings for Portuguese. Our experiments show that the sense embedding model\n(Sense2vec) outperformed traditional word embeddings in syntactic and semantic\nanalogies task, proving that the language resource generated here can improve\nthe performance of NLP tasks in Portuguese. We also evaluated the performance\nof pre-trained deep neural language models (ELMo and BERT) in two transfer\nlearning approaches: feature based and fine-tuning, in the semantic textual\nsimilarity task. Our experiments indicate that the fine tuned Multilingual and\nPortuguese BERT language models were able to achieve better accuracy than the\nELMo model and baselines.",

    "abstract": "The concept of DNA storage was first suggested in 1959 by Richard Feynman who\nshared his vision regarding nanotechnology in the talk \"There is plenty of room\nat the bottom\". Later, towards the end of the 20-th century, the interest in\nstorage solutions based on DNA molecules was increased as a result of the human\ngenome project which in turn led to a significant progress in sequencing and\nassembly methods. DNA storage enjoys major advantages over the well-established\nmagnetic and optical storage solutions. As opposed to magnetic solutions, DNA\nstorage does not require electrical supply to maintain data integrity and is\nsuperior to other storage solutions in both density and durability. Given the\ntrends in cost decreases of DNA synthesis and sequencing, it is now\nacknowledged that within the next 10-15 years DNA storage may become a highly\ncompetitive archiving technology and probably later the main such technology.\nWith that said, the current implementations of DNA based storage systems are\nvery limited and are not fully optimized to address the unique pattern of\nerrors which characterize the synthesis and sequencing processes. In this work,\nwe propose a robust, efficient and scalable solution to implement DNA-based\nstorage systems. Our method deploys Deep Neural Networks (DNN) which\nreconstruct a sequence of letters based on imperfect cluster of copies\ngenerated by the synthesis and sequencing processes. A tailor-made\nError-Correcting Code (ECC) is utilized to combat patterns of errors which\noccur during this process. Since our reconstruction method is adapted to\nimperfect clusters, our method overcomes the time bottleneck of the noisy DNA\ncopies clustering process by allowing the use of a rapid and scalable\npseudo-clustering instead. Our architecture combines between convolutions and\ntransformers blocks and is trained using synthetic data modelled after real\ndata statistics.",

While SLR provide many benefits, they also present several problems with\npunctual solutions for some of them. However, two main problems still remain:\nthe high time-/effort-consumption nature of SLR and the lack of an effective\nimpact of SLR results in the industry, as initially expected for SLR. Aims: The\nmain goal of this paper is to introduce a new view - which we name\nSustainability of SLR - on how to deal with SLR aiming at reducing those\nproblems. Method: We analyzed six reference studies published in the last\ndecade to identify, group, and analyze the SLR problems and their\ninterconnections. Based on such analysis, we proposed the view of\nSustainability of SLR that intends to address these problems. Results: The\nproposed view encompasses three dimensions (social, economic, and technical)\nthat could become SLR more sustainable in the sense that the four major\nproblems and 31 barriers (i.e., possible causes for those problems) that we\nidentified could be mitigated. Conclusions: The view of Sustainability of SLR\nintends to change the researchers' mindset to mitigate the inherent SLR\nproblems and, as a consequence, achieve sustainable SLR, i.e., those that\nconsume less time/effort to be conducted and updated with useful results for\nthe industry.",

This\napproach stands in contrast to autoencoders, also trained on raw text, but with\nthe objective of learning to encode each input as a vector that allows full\nreconstruction. Autoencoders are attractive because of their latent space\nstructure and generative properties. We therefore explore the construction of a\nsentence-level autoencoder from a pretrained, frozen transformer language\nmodel. We adapt the masked language modeling objective as a generative,\ndenoising one, while only training a sentence bottleneck and a single-layer\nmodified transformer decoder. We demonstrate that the sentence representations\ndiscovered by our model achieve better quality than previous methods that\nextract representations from pretrained transformers on text similarity tasks,\nstyle transfer (an example of controlled generation), and single-sentence\nclassification tasks in the GLUE benchmark, while using fewer parameters than\nlarge pretrained models.",

We present\na data-driven reduced order modeling method that capitalizes on this fact by\nfinding the coordinates of this manifold and finding an ordinary differential\nequation (ODE) describing the dynamics in this coordinate system.

Then the ODE, in these\ncoordinates, is approximated by a NN using the neural ODE framework. Both of\nthese methods only require snapshots of data to learn a model, and the data can\nbe widely and/or unevenly spaced. We apply this framework to the\nKuramoto-Sivashinsky for different domain sizes that exhibit chaotic dynamics.\nWith this system, we find that dimension reduction improves performance\nrelative to predictions in the ambient space, where artifacts arise. Then, with\nthe low-dimensional model, we vary the training data spacing and find excellent\nshort- and long-time statistical recreation of the true dynamics for widely\nspaced data (spacing of ~0.7 Lyapunov times).

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen enormous gains in core IR tasks, including document\nand passage ranking. Datasets and leaderboards, and in particular the MS MARCO\ndatasets, illustrate the dramatic improvements achieved by modern neural\nrankers. When compared with traditional test collections, the MS MARCO datasets\nemploy substantially more queries with substantially fewer known relevant items\nper query. Given the sparsity of these relevance labels, the MS MARCO\nleaderboards track improvements with mean reciprocal rank (MRR). In essence, a\nrelevant item is treated as the \"right answer\", with rankers scored on their\nability to place this item high in the ranking. In working with these sparse\nlabels, we have observed that the top items returned by a ranker often appear\nsuperior to judged relevant items. To test this observation, we employed\ncrowdsourced workers to make preference judgments between the top item returned\nby a modern neural ranking stack and a judged relevant item. The results\nsupport our observation. If we imagine a perfect ranker under MRR, with a score\nof 1 on all queries, our preference judgments indicate that a searcher would\nprefer the top result from a modern neural ranking stack more frequently than\nthe top result from the imaginary perfect ranker, making our neural ranker\n\"better than perfect\". To understand the implications for the leaderboard, we\npooled the top document from available runs near the top of the passage ranking\nleaderboard for over 500 queries. We employed crowdsourced workers to make\npreference judgments over these pools and re-evaluated the runs. Our results\nsupport our concerns that current MS MARCO datasets may no longer be able to\nrecognize genuine improvements in rankers. In future, if rankers are measured\nagainst a single \"right answer\", this answer should be the best answer or most\npreferred answer, and maintained with ongoing judgments.",

    "title": "Primal-Dual Algorithms for Indivisible Concave Allocation with Bounded  Local Curvature",
    "abstract": "We study a general allocation setting where agent valuations are specified by\nan arbitrary set of monotone concave functions. In this model, a collection of\nitems must be uniquely assigned to a set of agents, where all agent-item pairs\nhave a specified bid value. The objective is to maximize the sum of agent\nvaluations, each of which is a nondecreasing concave function of the agent's\ntotal spend. This setting was studied by Devanur and Jain (STOC 2012) in the\nonline setting for fractional assignments. In this paper, we generalize the\nstate of the art in the offline setting for indivisible allocations. In\nparticular, for a collection of monotone concave functions and maximum bid\nvalue $b$, we define the notion of a local curvature bound $c_\\ell\\in (0,1]$,\nwhich intuitively measures the largest multiplicative gap between any valuation\nfunction and a local linear lower bound with $x$-width $b$. For our main\ncontribution, we define an efficient primal-dual algorithm that achieves an\napproximation of $(1-\\epsilon)c_\\ell$, and provide a matching $c_\\ell$\nintegrality gap, showing our algorithm is optimal among those that utilize the\nnatural assignment CP.\nAdditionally, we show our techniques have an interesting extension to the\nSmooth Nash Social Welfare problem (Fain et al. EC 2018, Fluschnik et al. AAAI\n2019), which is a variant of NSW that reduces the extent to which the objective\npenalizes under-allocations by adding a smoothing constant to agent utilities.\nThis objective can be viewed as a sum of logs optimization, which therefore\nfalls in the above setting. However, we also show how our techniques can be\nextended to obtain an approximation for the canonical product objective by\nobtaining an additive guarantee for the log version of the problem.",

This aims to reduce outliers in the\ndistribution of values and promote piece-wise constant maps, which are more\nsuitable for quantization. Secondly, we consider symmetric and stable variants\nof common CNNs for image classification, and Graph Convolutional Networks\n(GCNs) for graph node-classification. We demonstrate through several\nexperiments that the property of forward stability preserves the action of a\nnetwork under different quantization rates. As a result, stable quantized\nnetworks behave similarly to their non-quantized counterparts even though they\nrely on fewer parameters.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) bring the power of deep representation learning\nto graph and relational data and achieve state-of-the-art performance in many\napplications. GNNs compute node representations by taking into account the\ntopology of the node's ego-network and the features of the ego-network's nodes.\nWhen the nodes do not have high-quality features, GNNs learn an embedding layer\nto compute node embeddings and use them as input features. However, the size of\nthe embedding layer is linear to the graph size and does not scale to graphs\nwith hundreds of millions of nodes. To reduce the memory associated with this\nembedding layer, hashing-based approaches, commonly used in applications like\nNLP and recommender systems, can potentially be used. However, a direct\napplication of these ideas fails to exploit the fact that in many real-world\ngraphs, nodes that are topologically close will tend to be related to each\nother (homophily) and as such their representations will be similar.\nIn this work, we present approaches that take advantage of the nodes'\nposition in the graph to dramatically reduce the memory required, with minimal\nif any degradation in the quality of the resulting GNN model. Our approaches\ndecompose a node's embedding into two components: a position-specific component\nand a node-specific component. The position-specific component models homophily\nand the node-specific component models the node-to-node variation. Extensive\nexperiments using different datasets and GNN models show that in nearly all\ncases, our methods are able to reduce the memory requirements by 86% to 97%\nwhile achieving better classification accuracy than other competing approaches,\nincluding the full embeddings.",

To address this issue, we propose the Dense Proposals\nAttack (DPA) to learn robust, physical and targeted adversarial camouflages for\ndetectors. The camouflages are robust because they remain adversarial when\nfilmed under arbitrary viewpoint and different illumination conditions,\nphysical because they function well both in the 3D virtual scene and the real\nworld, and targeted because they can cause detectors to misidentify an object\nas a specific target class. In order to make the generated camouflages robust\nin the physical world, we introduce a combination of viewpoint shifts, lighting\nand other natural transformations to model the physical phenomena. In addition,\nto improve the attacks, DPA substantially attacks all the classifications in\nthe fixed region proposals. Moreover, we build a virtual 3D scene using the\nUnity simulation engine to fairly and reproducibly evaluate different physical\nattacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DPA outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods significantly, and generalizes well to the real world,\nposing a potential threat to the security-critical computer vision systems.",

To address this\nchallenge, we study neural networks from a nonlinear computation point of view\nand propose a novel weight initialization strategy that is based on the linear\nproduct structure (LPS) of neural networks. The proposed strategy is derived\nfrom the polynomial approximation of activation functions by using theories of\nnumerical algebraic geometry to guarantee to find all the local minima. We also\nprovide a theoretical analysis that the LPS initialization has a lower\nprobability of dying ReLU comparing to other existing initialization\nstrategies. Finally, we test the LPS initialization algorithm on both fully\nconnected neural networks and convolutional neural networks to show its\nfeasibility, efficiency, and robustness on public datasets.",

    "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT)-based indoor localization has gained significant\npopularity recently to satisfy the ever-increasing requirements of indoor\nLocation-based Services (LBS). In this context, Inertial Measurement Unit\n(IMU)-based localization is of interest as it provides a scalable solution\nindependent of any proprietary sensors/modules. Existing IMU-based\nmethodologies, however, are mainly developed based on statistical heading and\nstep length estimation techniques that suffer from cumulative error issues and\nhave extensive computational time requirements limiting their application for\nreal-time indoor positioning. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose\nthe Online Dynamic Window (ODW)-assisted two-stage Long Short Term Memory\n(LSTM) localization framework. Three ODWs are proposed, where the first model\nuses a Natural Language Processing (NLP)-inspired Dynamic Window (DW) approach,\nwhich significantly reduces the required computational time. The second\nframework is developed based on a Signal Processing Dynamic Windowing (SP-DW)\napproach to further reduce the required processing time of the two-stage\nLSTM-based model. The third ODW, referred to as the SP-NLP, combines the first\ntwo windowing mechanisms to further improve the overall achieved accuracy.\nCompared to the traditional LSTM-based positioning approaches, which suffer\nfrom either high tensor computation requirements or low accuracy, the proposed\nODW-assisted models can perform indoor localization in a near-real time fashion\nwith high accuracy. Performances of the proposed ODW-assisted models are\nevaluated based on a real Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) dataset. The results\nillustrate potentials of the proposed ODW-assisted techniques in achieving high\nclassification accuracy with significantly reduced computational time, making\nthem applicable for near real-time implementations.",

    "abstract": "Today, two-factor authentication (2FA) is a widely implemented mechanism to\ncounter phishing attacks. Although much effort has been investigated in 2FA,\nmost 2FA systems are still vulnerable to carefully designed phishing attacks,\nand some even request special hardware, which limits their wide deployment.\nRecently, real-time phishing (RTP) has made the situation even worse because an\nadversary can effortlessly establish a phishing website replicating a target\nwebsite without any background of the web page design technique. Traditional\n2FA can be easily bypassed by such RTP attacks. In this work, we propose a\nnovel 2FA system to counter RTP attacks. The main idea is to request a user to\ntake a photo of the web browser with the domain name in the address bar as the\n2nd authentication factor. The web server side extracts the domain name\ninformation based on Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and then determines\nif the user is visiting this website or a fake one, thus defeating the RTP\nattacks where an adversary must set up a fake website with a different domain.\nWe prototyped our system and evaluated its performance in various environments.\nThe results showed that PhotoAuth is an effective technique with good\nscalability. We also showed that compared to other 2FA systems, PhotoAuth has\nseveral advantages, especially no special hardware or software support is\nneeded on the client side except a phone, making it readily deployable.",

Although this\nbrings benefits, spending lots of enthusiasm to master one of the multi-model\nquery languages for exploring a database is unfriendly to most users.\nTherefore, we study using keyword searches as an alternative way to explore and\nquery multi-model databases. In this paper, we attempt to utilize quantum\nphysics's probabilistic formalism to bring the problem into vector spaces and\nrepresent events (e.g., words) as subspaces. Then we employ a density matrix to\nencapsulate all the information over these subspaces and use density matrices\nto measure the divergence between query and candidate answers for finding\ntop-\\textit{k} the most relevant results.

To demonstrate it\nclearly, we are centered around the following modules: generating initial state\nbased on loaded multi-model data, influencing learning process by setting\nparameters, controlling generated relational schema through providing semantic\nconstraints, improving the query performance of relational schema by specifying\nqueries, and a highly interactive interface for showing query performance and\nstorage consumption when users adjust the generated relational schema.",

However, most of the traditional anomaly detection methods\nneglect the relation structure information among data points and therefore\ncannot effectively generalize to the graph structure data. In this paper, we\npropose an end-to-end model of Deep Dual Support Vector Data description based\nAutoencoder (Dual-SVDAE) for anomaly detection on attributed networks, which\nconsiders both the structure and attribute for attributed networks.\nSpecifically, Dual-SVDAE consists of a structure autoencoder and an attribute\nautoencoder to learn the latent representation of the node in the structure\nspace and attribute space respectively. Then, a dual-hypersphere learning\nmechanism is imposed on them to learn two hyperspheres of normal nodes from the\nstructure and attribute perspectives respectively. Moreover, to achieve joint\nlearning between the structure and attribute of the network, we fuse the\nstructure embedding and attribute embedding as the final input of the feature\ndecoder to generate the node attribute. Finally, abnormal nodes can be detected\nby measuring the distance of nodes to the learned center of each hypersphere in\nthe latent structure space and attribute space respectively.

To address this problem, researchers have proposed\nmulti-model databases to support multiple data models in a uniform platform\nwith a single unified query language. However, since relational databases are\npredominant in the current market, it is expensive to replace them with others.\nBesides, due to the theories and technologies of RDBMSs having been enhanced\nover decades, it is hard to use few years to develop a multi-model database\nthat can be compared with existing RDBMSs in handling security, query\noptimization, transaction management, etc. In this paper, we reconsider\nemploying relational databases to store and query multi-model data.\nUnfortunately, the mismatch between the complexity of multi-model data\nstructure and the simplicity of flat relational tables makes this difficult.\nAgainst this challenge, we utilize the reinforcement learning (RL) method to\nlearn a relational schema by interacting with an RDBMS. Instead of using the\nclassic Q-learning algorithm, we propose a variant Q-learning algorithm, called\n\\textit{Double Q-tables}, to reduce the dimension of the original Q-table and\nimprove learning efficiency.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) involves multiple distributed devices jointly\ntraining a shared model without any of the participants having to reveal their\nlocal data to a centralized server. Most of previous FL approaches assume that\ndata on devices are fixed and stationary during the training process. However,\nthis assumption is unrealistic because these devices usually have varying\nsampling rates and different system configurations. In addition, the underlying\ndistribution of the device data can change dynamically over time, which is\nknown as concept drift. Concept drift makes the learning process complicated\nbecause of the inconsistency between existing and upcoming data. Traditional\nconcept drift handling techniques such as chunk based and ensemble\nlearning-based methods are not suitable in the federated learning frameworks\ndue to the heterogeneity of local devices. We propose a novel approach,\nFedConD, to detect and deal with the concept drift on local devices and\nminimize the effect on the performance of models in asynchronous FL. The drift\ndetection strategy is based on an adaptive mechanism which uses the historical\nperformance of the local models. The drift adaptation is realized by adjusting\nthe regularization parameter of objective function on each local device.\nAdditionally, we design a communication strategy on the server side to select\nlocal updates in a prudent fashion and speed up model convergence.

    "abstract": "The availability of parallel sentence simplification (SS) is scarce for\nneural SS modelings. We propose an unsupervised method to build SS corpora from\nlarge-scale bilingual translation corpora, alleviating the need for SS\nsupervised corpora. Our method is motivated by the following two findings:\nneural machine translation model usually tends to generate more high-frequency\ntokens and the difference of text complexity levels exists between the source\nand target language of a translation corpus. By taking the pair of the source\nsentences of translation corpus and the translations of their references in a\nbridge language, we can construct large-scale pseudo parallel SS data. Then, we\nkeep these sentence pairs with a higher complexity difference as SS sentence\npairs. The building SS corpora with an unsupervised approach can satisfy the\nexpectations that the aligned sentences preserve the same meanings and have\ndifference in text complexity levels. Experimental results show that SS methods\ntrained by our corpora achieve the state-of-the-art results and significantly\noutperform the results on English benchmark WikiLarge.",

Researchers have worked hard\ntrying to automate many components of the pipeline. However, one key component\nof the pipeline--problem definition--is still left mostly unexplored in terms\nof automation. Usually, it requires extensive efforts from domain experts to\nidentify, define and formulate important problems in an area. However,\nautomatically discovering research or application problems for an area is\nbeneficial since it helps to identify valid and potentially important problems\nhidden in data that are unknown to domain experts, expand the scope of tasks\nthat we can do in an area, and even inspire completely new findings.\nThis paper describes Problem Learning, which aims at learning to discover and\ndefine valid and ethical problems from data or from the machine's interaction\nwith the environment. We formalize problem learning as the identification of\nvalid and ethical problems in a problem space and introduce several possible\napproaches to problem learning. In a broader sense, problem learning is an\napproach towards the free will of intelligent machines. Currently, machines are\nstill limited to solving the problems defined by humans, without the ability or\nflexibility to freely explore various possible problems that are even unknown\nto humans. Though many machine learning techniques have been developed and\nintegrated into intelligent systems, they still focus on the means rather than\nthe purpose in that machines are still solving human defined problems. However,\nproposing good problems is sometimes even more important than solving problems,\nbecause a good problem can help to inspire new ideas and gain deeper\nunderstandings. The paper also discusses the ethical implications of problem\nlearning under the background of Responsible AI.",

    "abstract": "We describe a rule-based approach for the automatic acquisition of scientific\nentities from scholarly article titles. Two observations motivated the\napproach: (i) noting the concentration of an article's contribution information\nin its title; and (ii) capturing information pattern regularities via a system\nof rules that alleviate the human annotation task in creating gold standards\nthat annotate single instances at a time. We identify a set of lexico-syntactic\npatterns that are easily recognizable, that occur frequently, and that\ngenerally indicates the scientific entity type of interest about the scholarly\ncontribution.\nA subset of the acquisition algorithm is implemented for article titles in\nthe Computational Linguistics (CL) scholarly domain. The tool called\nORKG-Title-Parser, in its first release, identifies the following six concept\ntypes of scientific terminology from the CL paper titles, viz. research\nproblem, solution, resource, language, tool, and method. It has been\nempirically evaluated on a collection of 50,237 titles that cover nearly all\narticles in the ACL Anthology. It has extracted 19,799 research problems;\n18,111 solutions; 20,033 resources; 1,059 languages; 6,878 tools; and 21,687\nmethods at an average extraction precision of 75%. The code and related data\nresources are publicly available at\nhttps://gitlab.com/TIBHannover/orkg/orkg-title-parser.\nFinally, in the article, we discuss extensions and applications to areas such\nas scholarly knowledge graph (SKG) creation.",

    "title": "A real-time global re-localization framework for 3D LiDAR SLAM",
    "abstract": "Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) has been a hot research field in\nthe past years. Against the backdrop of more affordable 3D LiDAR sensors,\nresearch on 3D LiDAR SLAM is becoming increasingly popular. Furthermore, the\nre-localization problem with a point cloud map is the foundation for other SLAM\napplications. In this paper, a template matching framework is proposed to\nre-localize a robot globally in a 3D LiDAR map. This presents two main\nchallenges. First, most global descriptors for point cloud can only be used for\nplace detection under a small local area. Therefore, in order to re-localize\nglobally in the map, point clouds and descriptors(templates) are densely\ncollected using a reconstructed mesh model at an offline stage by a physical\nsimulation engine to expand the functional distance of point cloud descriptors.\nSecond, the increased number of collected templates makes the matching stage\ntoo slow to meet the real-time requirement, for which a cascade matching method\nis presented for better efficiency. In the experiments, the proposed framework\nachieves 0.2-meter accuracy at about 10Hz matching speed using pure python\nimplementation with 100k templates, which is effective and efficient for SLAM\napplications.",

    "title": "An Empirical Study on the Joint Impact of Feature Selection and Data  Resampling on Imbalance Classification",
    "abstract": "Real-world datasets often present different degrees of imbalanced (i.e.,\nlong-tailed or skewed) distributions. While the majority (a.k.a., head or\nfrequent) classes have sufficient samples, the minority (a.k.a., tail or rare)\nclasses can be under-represented by a rather limited number of samples. On one\nhand, data resampling is a common approach to tackling class imbalance. On the\nother hand, dimension reduction, which reduces the feature space, is a\nconventional machine learning technique for building stronger classification\nmodels on a dataset. However, the possible synergy between feature selection\nand data resampling for high-performance imbalance classification has rarely\nbeen investigated before. To address this issue, this paper carries out a\ncomprehensive empirical study on the joint influence of feature selection and\nresampling on two-class imbalance classification. Specifically, we study the\nperformance of two opposite pipelines for imbalance classification, i.e.,\napplying feature selection before or after data resampling. We conduct a large\namount of experiments (a total of 9225 experiments) on 52 publicly available\ndatasets, using 9 feature selection methods, 6 resampling approaches for class\nimbalance learning, and 3 well-known classification algorithms. Experimental\nresults show that there is no constant winner between the two pipelines, thus\nboth of them should be considered to derive the best performing model for\nimbalance classification. We also find that the performance of an imbalance\nclassification model depends on the classifier adopted, the ratio between the\nnumber of majority and minority samples (IR), as well as on the ratio between\nthe number of samples and features (SFR). Overall, this study should provide\nnew reference value for researchers and practitioners in imbalance learning.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we focus on resource allocation in a decentralised open market.\nIn decentralised open markets consists of multiple vendors and multiple\ndynamically-arriving buyers, thus makes the market complex and dynamic.\nBecause, in these markets, negotiations among vendors and buyers take place\nover multiple conflicting issues such as price, scalability, robustness, delay,\netc. As a result, optimising the resource allocation in such open markets\nbecomes directly dependent on two key decisions, which are; incorporating a\ndifferent kind of buyers' preferences, and fairness based vendor elicitation\nstrategy. Towards this end, in this work, we propose a three-step resource\nallocation approach that employs a reverse-auction paradigm. At the first step,\npriority label is attached to each bidding vendor based on the proposed\npriority mechanism. Then, at the second step, the preference score is\ncalculated for all the different kinds of preferences of the buyers. Finally,\nat the third step, based on the priority label of the vendor and the preference\nscore winner is determined. Finally, we compare the proposed approach with two\nstate-of-the-art resource pricing and allocation strategies. The experimental\nresults show that the proposed approach outperforms the other two resource\nallocation approaches in terms of the independent utilities of buyers and the\noverall utility of the open market.",

    "abstract": "Person search aims to simultaneously localize and identify a query person\nfrom realistic, uncropped images. To achieve this goal, state-of-the-art models\ntypically add a re-id branch upon two-stage detectors like Faster R-CNN. Owing\nto the ROI-Align operation, this pipeline yields promising accuracy as re-id\nfeatures are explicitly aligned with the corresponding object regions, but in\nthe meantime, it introduces high computational overhead due to dense object\nanchors. In this work, we present an anchor-free approach to efficiently\ntackling this challenging task, by introducing the following dedicated designs.\nFirst, we select an anchor-free detector (i.e., FCOS) as the prototype of our\nframework. Due to the lack of dense object anchors, it exhibits significantly\nhigher efficiency compared with existing person search models. Second, when\ndirectly accommodating this anchor-free detector for person search, there exist\nseveral major challenges in learning robust re-id features, which we summarize\nas the misalignment issues in different levels (i.e., scale, region, and task).\nTo address these issues, we propose an aligned feature aggregation module to\ngenerate more discriminative and robust feature embeddings. Accordingly, we\nname our model as Feature-Aligned Person Search Network (AlignPS). Third, by\ninvestigating the advantages of both anchor-based and anchor-free models, we\nfurther augment AlignPS with an ROI-Align head, which significantly improves\nthe robustness of re-id features while still keeping our model highly\nefficient. Extensive experiments conducted on two challenging benchmarks (i.e.,\nCUHK-SYSU and PRW) demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art or\ncompetitive performance, while displaying higher efficiency.

    "title": "Diverse Sample Generation: Pushing the Limit of Data-free Quantization",
    "abstract": "Recently, generative data-free quantization emerges as a practical approach\nthat compresses the neural network to low bit-width without access to real\ndata. It generates data to quantize the network by utilizing the batch\nnormalization (BN) statistics of its full-precision counterpart. However, our\nstudy shows that in practice, the synthetic data completely constrained by BN\nstatistics suffers severe homogenization at distribution and sample level,\nwhich causes serious accuracy degradation of the quantized network. This paper\npresents a generic Diverse Sample Generation (DSG) scheme for the generative\ndata-free post-training quantization and quantization-aware training, to\nmitigate the detrimental homogenization. In our DSG, we first slack the\nstatistics alignment for features in the BN layer to relax the distribution\nconstraint. Then we strengthen the loss impact of the specific BN layer for\ndifferent samples and inhibit the correlation among samples in the generation\nprocess, to diversify samples from the statistical and spatial perspective,\nrespectively. Extensive experiments show that for large-scale image\nclassification tasks, our DSG can consistently outperform existing data-free\nquantization methods on various neural architectures, especially under\nultra-low bit-width (e.g., 22% gain under W4A4 setting). Moreover, data\ndiversifying caused by our DSG brings a general gain in various quantization\nmethods, demonstrating diversity is an important property of high-quality\nsynthetic data for data-free quantization.",

    "abstract": "The top-k recommendation is a fundamental task in recommendation systems\nwhich is generally learned by comparing positive and negative pairs. The\nContrastive Loss (CL) is the key in contrastive learning that has received more\nattention recently and we find it is well suited for top-k recommendations.\nHowever, it is a problem that CL treats the importance of the positive and\nnegative samples as the same. On the one hand, CL faces the imbalance problem\nof one positive sample and many negative samples. On the other hand, positive\nitems are so few in sparser datasets that their importance should be\nemphasized. Moreover, the other important issue is that the sparse positive\nitems are still not sufficiently utilized in recommendations. So we propose a\nnew data augmentation method by using multiple positive items (or samples)\nsimultaneously with the CL loss function. Therefore, we propose a Multi-Sample\nbased Contrastive Loss (MSCL) function which solves the two problems by\nbalancing the importance of positive and negative samples and data\naugmentation. And based on the graph convolution network (GCN) method,\nexperimental results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of MSCL. The\nproposed MSCL is simple and can be applied in many methods.

    "abstract": "Multi-objective symbolic regression has the advantage that while the accuracy\nof the learned models is maximized, the complexity is automatically adapted and\nneed not be specified a-priori. The result of the optimization is not a single\nsolution anymore, but a whole Pareto-front describing the trade-off between\naccuracy and complexity. In this contribution we study which complexity\nmeasures are most appropriately used in symbolic regression when performing\nmulti- objective optimization with NSGA-II. Furthermore, we present a novel\ncomplexity measure that includes semantic information based on the function\nsymbols occurring in the models and test its effects on several benchmark\ndatasets. Results comparing multiple complexity measures are presented in terms\nof the achieved accuracy and model length to illustrate how the search\ndirection of the algorithm is affected.",

    "abstract": "Transfer learning through large pre-trained models has changed the landscape\nof current applications in natural language processing (NLP). Recently Optimus,\na variational autoencoder (VAE) which combines two pre-trained models, BERT and\nGPT-2, has been released, and its combination with generative adversial\nnetworks (GANs) has been shown to produce novel, yet very human-looking text.\nThe Optimus and GANs combination avoids the troublesome application of GANs to\nthe discrete domain of text, and prevents the exposure bias of standard maximum\nlikelihood methods. We combine the training of GANs in the latent space, with\nthe finetuning of the decoder of Optimus for single word generation. This\napproach lets us model both the high-level features of the sentences, and the\nlow-level word-by-word generation. We finetune using reinforcement learning\n(RL) by exploiting the structure of GPT-2 and by adding entropy-based\nintrinsically motivated rewards to balance between quality and diversity. We\nbenchmark the results of the VAE-GAN model, and show the improvements brought\nby our RL finetuning on three widely used datasets for text generation, with\nresults that greatly surpass the current state-of-the-art for the quality of\nthe generated texts.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, powered by the learned discriminative representation via\ngraph neural network (GNN) models, deep graph matching methods have made great\nprogresses in the task of matching semantic features. However, these methods\nusually rely on heuristically generated graph patterns, which may introduce\nunreliable relationships to hurt the matching performance. In this paper, we\npropose a joint \\emph{graph learning and matching} network, named GLAM, to\nexplore reliable graph structures for boosting graph matching. GLAM adopts a\npure attention-based framework for both graph learning and graph matching.\nSpecifically, it employs two types of attention mechanisms, self-attention and\ncross-attention for the task. The self-attention discovers the relationships\nbetween features and to further update feature representations over the learnt\nstructures; and the cross-attention computes cross-graph correlations between\nthe two feature sets to be matched for feature reconstruction. Moreover, the\nfinal matching solution is directly derived from the output of the\ncross-attention layer, without employing a specific matching decision module.\nThe proposed method is evaluated on three popular visual matching benchmarks\n(Pascal VOC, Willow Object and SPair-71k), and it outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-art graph matching methods by significant margins on all\nbenchmarks. Furthermore, the graph patterns learnt by our model are validated\nto be able to remarkably enhance previous deep graph matching methods by\nreplacing their handcrafted graph structures with the learnt ones.",

    "abstract": "Complex Event Recognition (CER) systems have become popular in the past two\ndecades due to their ability to \"instantly\" detect patterns on real-time\nstreams of events. However, there is a lack of methods for forecasting when a\npattern might occur before such an occurrence is actually detected by a CER\nengine. We present a formal framework that attempts to address the issue of\nComplex Event Forecasting (CEF). Our framework combines two formalisms: a)\nsymbolic automata which are used to encode complex event patterns; and b)\nprediction suffix trees which can provide a succinct probabilistic description\nof an automaton's behavior. We compare our proposed approach against\nstate-of-the-art methods and show its advantage in terms of accuracy and\nefficiency. In particular, prediction suffix trees, being variable-order Markov\nmodels, have the ability to capture long-term dependencies in a stream by\nremembering only those past sequences that are informative enough. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate the benefits, in terms of accuracy, of being\nable to capture such long-term dependencies. This is achieved by increasing the\norder of our model beyond what is possible with full-order Markov models that\nneed to perform an exhaustive enumeration of all possible past sequences of a\ngiven order. We also discuss extensively how CEF solutions should be best\nevaluated on the quality of their forecasts.",

    "abstract": "The adiabatic quantum-flux parametron (AQFP) is a promising energy-efficient\nsuperconducting technology. Before technology mapping, additional buffer and\nsplitter cells need to be inserted into AQFP circuits to fulfill two special\nconstraints: (1) Input signals to a logic gate need to arrive at the same time,\nthus shorter paths need to be delayed with buffers. (2) The output signal of a\nlogic gate has to be actively branched with splitters if it drives multiple\nfanouts. Buffers and splitters largely increase the area and delay in AQFP\ncircuits. Na\\\"ive buffer and splitter insertion and light-weight optimization\nusing retiming techniques have been used in related works, and it is not clear\nhow much space there is for further optimization. In this paper, we develop (a)\na linear-time algorithm to insert buffers and splitters irredundantly, and (b)\noptimization methods by scheduling and by moving groups of gates, called\nchunks, together. Experimental results show a reduction of up to 39% on buffer\nand splitter cost. Moreover, as the technology is still developing and\nassumptions on the physical constraints are not clear yet, we also discuss the\nimpacts of different assumptions with experimental results to motivate future\nresearch on AQFP register design.",

    "abstract": "Mobile wireless sensors are increasingly recognized as a valuable tool for\nmonitoring critical infrastructures. An important use case is the discovery of\nleaks and inflows in pipe networks using a swarm of floating sensor nodes.\nWhile passively drifting along, the devices must track their individual\npositions so critical points can later be located. Since pipelines are often\nsituated in inaccessible places, large portions of the network can be shielded\nfrom radio and satellite signals, rendering conventional positioning systems\nineffective.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for assigning location estimates\nto recorded measurements once the sensor node leaves the inaccessible area and\ntransmits them via a gateway. The solution is range-free and makes use of a\npriori information about the target pipeline network. We further describe two\nextended variants of our algorithm which use data of encounters with other\nsensor nodes to improve accuracy. Finally, we evaluate all variants with\nrespect to various network topologies and different numbers of mobile nodes in\na simulation. The results show that our algorithm localizes measurements with\nan average accuracy between 4.81% and 7.58%, depending on the variability of\nflow speed and the sparsity of reference points.",

    "abstract": "One of the new scientific ways of understanding discourse dynamics is\nanalyzing the public data of social networks. This research's aim is\nPost-structuralist Discourse Analysis (PDA) of Covid-19 phenomenon (inspired by\nLaclau and Mouffe's Discourse Theory) by using Intelligent Data Mining for\nPersian Society. The examined big data is five million tweets from 160,000\nusers of the Persian Twitter network to compare two discourses. Besides\nanalyzing the tweet texts individually, a social network graph database has\nbeen created based on retweets relationships. We use the VoteRank algorithm to\nintroduce and rank people whose posts become word of mouth, provided that the\ntotal information spreading scope is maximized over the network. These users\nare also clustered according to their word usage pattern (the Gaussian Mixture\nModel is used). The constructed discourse of influential spreaders is compared\nto the most active users. This analysis is done based on Covid-related posts\nover eight episodes. Also, by relying on the statistical content analysis and\npolarity of tweet words, discourse analysis is done for the whole mentioned\nsubpopulations, especially for the top individuals. The most important result\nof this research is that the Twitter subjects' discourse construction is\ngovernment-based rather than community-based. The analyzed Iranian society does\nnot consider itself responsible for the Covid-19 wicked problem, does not\nbelieve in participation, and expects the government to solve all problems. The\nmost active and most influential users' similarity is that political, national,\nand critical discourse construction is the predominant one. In addition to the\nadvantages of its research methodology, it is necessary to pay attention to the\nstudy's limitations. Suggestion for future encounters of Iranian society with\nsimilar crises is given.",

    "abstract": "XML configuration files are widely used in Android to define an app's user\ninterface and essential runtime information such as system permissions. As\nAndroid evolves, it might introduce functional changes in the configuration\nenvironment, thus causing compatibility issues that manifest as inconsistent\napp behaviors at different API levels. Such issues can often induce software\ncrashes and inconsistent look-and-feel when running at specific Android\nversions. Existing works incur plenty of false positive and false negative\nissue-detection rules by conducting trivial data-flow analysis while failing to\nmodel the XML tree hierarchies of the Android configuration files. Besides,\nlittle is known about how the changes in an Android framework can induce such\ncompatibility issues. To bridge such gaps, we conducted a systematic study by\nanalyzing 196 real-world issues collected from 43 popular apps. We identified\ncommon patterns of Android framework code changes that induce such\nconfiguration compatibility issues. Based on the findings, we propose\n\\textsc{ConfDroid} that can automatically extract rules for detecting\nconfiguration compatibility issues. The intuition is to perform symbolic\nexecution based on a model learned from the common code change patterns.\nExperiment results show that ConfDroid can successfully extract 282 valid\nissue-detection rules with a precision of 91.9%. Among them, 65 extracted rules\ncan manifest issues that cannot be detected by the rules of state-of-the-art\nbaselines. More importantly, 11 out of them have led to the detection of 107\nreproducible configuration compatibility issues that the baselines cannot\ndetect in 30 out of 316 real-world Android apps.",

    "abstract": "Qualitative research provides methodological guidelines for observing and\nstudying communities and cultures on online social media platforms. However,\nsuch methods demand considerable manual effort from researchers and may be\noverly focused and narrowed to certain online groups. In this work, we propose\na complete solution to accelerate qualitative analysis of problematic online\nspeech -- with a specific focus on opinions emerging from online communities --\nby leveraging machine learning algorithms. First, we employ qualitative methods\nof deep observation for understanding problematic online speech. This initial\nqualitative study constructs an ontology of problematic speech, which contains\nsocial media postings annotated with their underlying opinions. The qualitative\nstudy also dynamically constructs the set of opinions, simultaneous with\nlabeling the postings. Next, we collect a large dataset from three online\nsocial media platforms (Facebook, Twitter and Youtube) using keywords. Finally,\nwe introduce an iterative data exploration procedure to augment the dataset. It\nalternates between a data sampler, which balances exploration and exploitation\nof unlabeled data, the automatic labeling of the sampled data, the manual\ninspection by the qualitative mapping team and, finally, the retraining of the\nautomatic opinion classifier. We present both qualitative and quantitative\nresults. First, we present detailed case studies of the dynamics of problematic\nspeech in a far-right Facebook group, exemplifying its mutation from\nconservative to extreme. Next, we show that our method successfully learns from\nthe initial qualitatively labeled and narrowly focused dataset, and constructs\na larger dataset. Using the latter, we examine the dynamics of opinion\nemergence and co-occurrence, and we hint at some of the pathways through which\nextreme opinions creep into the mainstream online discourse.",

    "abstract": "Regularization-based methods are beneficial to alleviate the catastrophic\nforgetting problem in class-incremental learning. With the absence of old task\nimages, they often assume that old knowledge is well preserved if the\nclassifier produces similar output on new images. In this paper, we find that\ntheir effectiveness largely depends on the nature of old classes: they work\nwell on classes that are easily distinguishable between each other but may fail\non more fine-grained ones, e.g., boy and girl. In spirit, such methods project\nnew data onto the feature space spanned by the weight vectors in the fully\nconnected layer, corresponding to old classes. The resulting projections would\nbe similar on fine-grained old classes, and as a consequence the new classifier\nwill gradually lose the discriminative ability on these classes. To address\nthis issue, we propose a memory-free generative replay strategy to preserve the\nfine-grained old classes characteristics by generating representative old\nimages directly from the old classifier and combined with new data for new\nclassifier training. To solve the homogenization problem of the generated\nsamples, we also propose a diversity loss that maximizes Kullback Leibler (KL)\ndivergence between generated samples. Our method is best complemented by prior\nregularization-based methods proved to be effective for easily distinguishable\nold classes. We validate the above design and insights on CUB-200-2011,\nCaltech-101, CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet and show that our strategy outperforms\nexisting memory-free methods with a clear margin.

In this work, two control solutions are\nproposed to solve two specific problems in aerial transportation of payload, as\nmentioned below. In the first work, we explore the tracking control problem for\na six degrees-of-freedom quadrotor carrying different unknown payloads. Due to\nthe state-dependent nature of the uncertainties caused by variation in the\ndynamics, the state-of-the-art adaptive control solutions would be ineffective\nagainst these uncertainties that can be completely unknown and possibly\nunbounded a priori. In addition, external disturbances such as wind while\nfollowing a trajectory in all three positions and attitude angles. Hence, an\nadaptive control solution for quadrotors is proposed, which does not require\nany a priori knowledge of the parameters of quadrotor dynamics and external\ndisturbances. The second work is focused on the interchanging dynamic behaviour\nof a quadrotor while loading and unloading different payloads during vertical\noperations. The control problem to maintain the desired altitude is formulated\nvia a switched dynamical framework to capture the interchanging dynamics of the\nquadrotor during such vertical operations, and a robust adaptive control\nsolution is proposed to tackle such dynamics when it is unknown. The stability\nof the closed-loop system is studied analytically and the effectiveness of the\nproposed solution is verified via simulations.",

    "title": "Exploring deep learning methods for recognizing rare diseases and their  clinical manifestations from texts",
    "abstract": "Although rare diseases are characterized by low prevalence, approximately 300\nmillion people are affected by a rare disease. The early and accurate diagnosis\nof these conditions is a major challenge for general practitioners, who do not\nhave enough knowledge to identify them. In addition to this, rare diseases\nusually show a wide variety of manifestations, which might make the diagnosis\neven more difficult. A delayed diagnosis can negatively affect the patient's\nlife. Therefore, there is an urgent need to increase the scientific and medical\nknowledge about rare diseases. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep\nLearning can help to extract relevant information about rare diseases to\nfacilitate their diagnosis and treatments. The paper explores the use of\nseveral deep learning techniques such as Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory\n(BiLSTM) networks or deep contextualized word representations based on\nBidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to recognize\nrare diseases and their clinical manifestations (signs and symptoms) in the\nRareDis corpus. This corpus contains more than 5,000 rare diseases and almost\n6,000 clinical manifestations. BioBERT, a domain-specific language\nrepresentation based on BERT and trained on biomedical corpora, obtains the\nbest results. In particular, this model obtains an F1-score of 85.2% for rare\ndiseases, outperforming all the other models.",

This paper introduces the Popularity-Homophily Index (PH\nIndex) as a new metric to measure homophily in directed graphs. The PH Index\ntakes into account the popularity of each actor in the interaction network,\nwith popularity precalculated with an importance algorithm like Google\nPageRank. The PH Index improves upon other existing measures by weighting a\nhomophilic edge leading to an important actor over a homophilic edge leading to\na less important actor. The PH Index can be calculated not only for a single\nnode in a directed graph but also for the entire graph. This paper calculates\nthe PH Index of two sample graphs and concludes with an overview of the\nstrengths and weaknesses of the PH Index, and its potential applications in the\nreal world.",

    "abstract": "The sequential recommendation aims to recommend items, such as products,\nsongs and places, to users based on the sequential patterns of their historical\nrecords. Most existing sequential recommender models consider the next item\nprediction task as the training signal. Unfortunately, there are two essential\nchallenges for these methods: (1) the long-term preference is difficult to\ncapture, and (2) the supervision signal is too sparse to effectively train a\nmodel. In this paper, we propose a novel sequential recommendation framework to\novercome these challenges based on a memory augmented multi-instance\ncontrastive predictive coding scheme, denoted as MMInfoRec. The basic\ncontrastive predictive coding (CPC) serves as encoders of sequences and items.\nThe memory module is designed to augment the auto-regressive prediction in CPC\nto enable a flexible and general representation of the encoded preference,\nwhich can improve the ability to capture the long-term preference. For\neffective training of the MMInfoRec model, a novel multi-instance noise\ncontrastive estimation (MINCE) loss is proposed, using multiple positive\nsamples, which offers effective exploitation of samples inside a mini-batch.\nThe proposed MMInfoRec framework falls into the contrastive learning style,\nwithin which, however, a further finetuning step is not required given that its\ncontrastive training task is well aligned with the target recommendation task.\nWith extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, MMInfoRec can outperform\nthe state-of-the-art baselines.",

The\nalgorithm is naturally amenable to distributed implementation that requires\nzero explicit coordination between the SBSs, and runs in $O(N + K \\log K)$\ntime, where $N$ is the number of SBSs (caches) and $K$ the maximum number of\nvideos.

We demonstrate that our algorithm closely\napproaches the optimal integral caching solution as the cache size increases.\nMoreover, via simulations carried out on real video access traces, we show that\nour algorithm effectively uses the SBS caches to reduce the video delivery\ndelay and conserve the remote server's bandwidth, and that it outperforms two\nother reference caching methods adapted to our system setting.",

    "abstract": "The Bitcoin P2P network currently represents a reference benchmark for modern\ncryptocurrencies. Its underlying protocol defines how transactions and blocks\nare distributed through all participating nodes. To protect user privacy, the\nidentity of the node originating a message is kept hidden. However, an\nadversary observing the whole network can analyze the spread pattern of a\ntransaction to trace it back to its source. This is possible thanks to the\nso-called rumor centrality, which is caused by the symmetry in the spreading of\ngossip-like protocols.\nRecent works try to address this issue by breaking the symmetry of the\nDiffusion protocol, currently used in Bitcoin, and leveraging proxied\nbroadcast. Nonetheless, the complexity of their design can be a barrier to\ntheir adoption in real life. In this work, we propose Clover, a novel\ntransaction relay protocol that protects the source of transaction messages\nwith a simple, yet effective, design. Compared to previous solutions, our\nprotocol does not require building propagation graphs, and reduces the ability\nof the adversary to gain precision by opening multiple connections towards the\nsame node.

    "abstract": "Chronic pain is recognized as a major health problem, with impacts not only\nat the economic, but also at the social, and individual levels. Being a private\nand subjective experience, it is impossible to externally and impartially\nexperience, describe, and interpret chronic pain as a purely noxious stimulus\nthat would directly point to a causal agent and facilitate its mitigation,\ncontrary to acute pain, the assessment of which is usually straightforward.\nVerbal communication is, thus, key to convey relevant information to health\nprofessionals that would otherwise not be accessible to external entities,\nnamely, intrinsic qualities about the painful experience and the patient. We\npropose and discuss a topic modelling approach to recognize patterns in verbal\ndescriptions of chronic pain, and use these patterns to quantify and qualify\nexperiences of pain. Our approaches allow for the extraction of novel insights\non chronic pain experiences from the obtained topic models and latent spaces.\nWe argue that our results are clinically relevant for the assessment and\nmanagement of chronic pain.",

    "abstract": "The broad scope of obstacle avoidance has led to many kinds of computer\nvision-based approaches. Despite its popularity, it is not a solved problem.\nTraditional computer vision techniques using cameras and depth sensors often\nfocus on static scenes, or rely on priors about the obstacles. Recent\ndevelopments in bio-inspired sensors present event cameras as a compelling\nchoice for dynamic scenes. Although these sensors have many advantages over\ntheir frame-based counterparts, such as high dynamic range and temporal\nresolution, event-based perception has largely remained in 2D. This often leads\nto solutions reliant on heuristics and specific to a particular task. We show\nthat the fusion of events and depth overcomes the failure cases of each\nindividual modality when performing obstacle avoidance. Our proposed approach\nunifies event camera and lidar streams to estimate metric time-to-impact\nwithout prior knowledge of the scene geometry or obstacles. In addition, we\nrelease an extensive event-based dataset with six visual streams spanning over\n700 scanned scenes.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new Linear Fractional Transformation (LFT) modeling\napproach for uncertain Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) multibody systems with\nparameter-dependent equilibrium. The most common procedure relies on the\npolynomial fitting of a set of Linear Time Invariant models over a grid of\nequilibrium points, which may be time consuming and miss worst-case\nconfigurations. An alternative is the symbolic linearization of the nonlinear\nequations, but it is often computationally heavy for complex systems. The\nproposed approach relies on the linearization of the equations at the\nsubstructure level before assembly of the multibody system. The linearized\nmodel is obtained under the form of a block-diagram, from which the LFT\nrepresentation can be derived as a continuous function of the uncertain,\nvarying and design parameters. Thus, the model covers all plants within the\nspecified bounds without introducing conservatism or fitting errors. The method\ncan be extended to boundary conditions, bodies and kinematic joints others than\nthose addressed in this paper by deriving their individual linearized models.\nTargeted engineering applications include modeling of uncertain LPV systems,\nrobust vibrations control, robust gain scheduling, integrated control/structure\nco-design. Two numerical applications: gain scheduling for a LPV robotic arm,\nand control/structure co-design of a stratospheric balloon with on-board\ntelescope, are proposed to illustrate the approach.",

    "abstract": "In multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA), the performance of a model highly\ndepends on the quality of synthesized embeddings. These embeddings are\ngenerated from the upstream process called multimodal fusion, which aims to\nextract and combine the input unimodal raw data to produce a richer multimodal\nrepresentation. Previous work either back-propagates the task loss or\nmanipulates the geometric property of feature spaces to produce favorable\nfusion results, which neglects the preservation of critical task-related\ninformation that flows from input to the fusion results. In this work, we\npropose a framework named MultiModal InfoMax (MMIM), which hierarchically\nmaximizes the Mutual Information (MI) in unimodal input pairs (inter-modality)\nand between multimodal fusion result and unimodal input in order to maintain\ntask-related information through multimodal fusion. The framework is jointly\ntrained with the main task (MSA) to improve the performance of the downstream\nMSA task. To address the intractable issue of MI bounds, we further formulate a\nset of computationally simple parametric and non-parametric methods to\napproximate their truth value. Experimental results on the two widely used\ndatasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

    "abstract": "The human-agent team, which is a problem in which humans and autonomous\nagents collaborate to achieve one task, is typical in human-AI collaboration.\nFor effective collaboration, humans want to have an effective plan, but in\nrealistic situations, they might have difficulty calculating the best plan due\nto cognitive limitations. In this case, guidance from an agent that has many\ncomputational resources may be useful. However, if an agent guides the human\nbehavior explicitly, the human may feel that they have lost autonomy and are\nbeing controlled by the agent. We therefore investigated implicit guidance\noffered by means of an agent's behavior. With this type of guidance, the agent\nacts in a way that makes it easy for the human to find an effective plan for a\ncollaborative task, and the human can then improve the plan. Since the human\nimproves their plan voluntarily, he or she maintains autonomy. We modeled a\ncollaborative agent with implicit guidance by integrating the Bayesian Theory\nof Mind into existing collaborative-planning algorithms and demonstrated\nthrough a behavioral experiment that implicit guidance is effective for\nenabling humans to maintain a balance between improving their plans and\nretaining autonomy.",

The existing blockchain solutions show downsides in communication and\nstorage scalability, as well as decentralization. In this article, we propose\nLightChain , which is the first blockchain architecture that operates over a\nDistributed Hash Table (DHT) of participating peers. LightChain is a\npermissionless blockchain that provides addressable blocks and transactions\nwithin the network, which makes them efficiently accessible by all peers. Each\nblock and transaction is replicated within the DHT of peers and is retrieved in\nan on-demand manner. Hence, peers in LightChain are not required to retrieve or\nkeep the entire ledger. LightChain is fair as all of the participating peers\nhave a uniform chance of being involved in the consensus regardless of their\ninfluence such as hashing power or stake. We provide formal mathematical\nanalysis and experimental results (simulations and cloud deployment) to\ndemonstrate the security, efficiency, and fairness of LightChain , and show\nthat LightChain is the only existing blockchain that can provide integrity\nunder the corrupted majority power of peers. As we experimentally demonstrate,\ncompared to the mainstream blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, LightChain\nrequires around 66 times smaller per node storage, and is around 380 times\nfaster on bootstrapping a new node to the system, and each LightChain node is\nrewarded equally likely for participating in the protocol.",

However, one-stop MDS is still unexplored because: (1) no dataset\nhas so large-scale dialogues contains both multiple medical services and\nfine-grained medical labels (i.e., intents, slots, values); (2) no model has\naddressed a MDS based on multiple-service conversations in a unified framework.\nIn this work, we first build a Multiple-domain Multiple-service medical\ndialogue (M^2-MedDialog)dataset, which contains 1,557 conversations between\ndoctors and patients, covering 276 types of diseases, 2,468 medical entities,\nand 3 specialties of medical services.

We first propose the\nconcept of SS-OTFS modulation, where the key novelty is the angular domain\ndiscretization enabled by the spatial-spreading/de-spreading. This\ndiscretization gives rise to simple and insightful effective models for both\nradar sensing and communication, which result in simplified designs for the\nrelated estimation and detection problems. In particular, we design simple beam\ntracking, angle estimation, and power allocation schemes for radar sensing, by\nutilizing the special structure of the effective radar sensing matrix.\nMeanwhile, we provide a detailed analysis on the pair-wise error probability\n(PEP) for communication, which unveils the key conditions for both precoding\nand power allocation designs. Based on those conditions, we design a\nsymbol-wise precoding scheme for communication based only on the delay,\nDoppler, and angle estimates from radar sensing, without the a priori knowledge\nof the communication channel fading coefficients, and also introduce the power\nallocation for communication. Furthermore, we notice that radar sensing and\ncommunication requires different power allocations. Therefore, we discuss the\nperformances of both the radar sensing and communication with different power\nallocations and show that the power allocation should be designed leaning\ntowards radar sensing in practical scenarios. The effectiveness of the proposed\nISAC transmission framework is verified by our numerical results, which also\nagree with our analysis and discussions.",

We continue this line of research by also\nevaluating ad hoc entity retrieval, and entity list completion. We also attempt\nto scale the model, so that it can support the complete INEX 2009 Wikipedia\ncollection. We do this by indexing the top keywords for each document, reducing\ncomplexity by partially lowering the number of nodes and, indirectly, the\nnumber of hyperedges linking terms to entities. This enables us to compare the\neffectiveness of the hypergraph-of-entity with the results obtained by the\nparticipants of the INEX tracks for the considered tasks. We find this to be a\nviable model that is, to our knowledge, the first attempt at a generalization\nin information retrieval, in particular by supporting a universal ranking\nfunction for multiple entity-oriented search tasks.",

    "abstract": "The annotation for large-scale point clouds is still time-consuming and\nunavailable for many real-world tasks. Point cloud pre-training is one\npotential solution for obtaining a scalable model for fast adaptation.\nTherefore, in this paper, we investigate a new self-supervised learning\napproach, called Mixing and Disentangling (MD), for point cloud pre-training.\nAs the name implies, we explore how to separate the original point cloud from\nthe mixed point cloud, and leverage this challenging task as a pretext\noptimization objective for model training. Considering the limited training\ndata in the original dataset, which is much less than prevailing ImageNet, the\nmixing process can efficiently generate more high-quality samples. We build one\nbaseline network to verify our intuition, which simply contains two modules,\nencoder and decoder. Given a mixed point cloud, the encoder is first\npre-trained to extract the semantic embedding. Then an instance-adaptive\ndecoder is harnessed to disentangle the point clouds according to the\nembedding. Albeit simple, the encoder is inherently able to capture the point\ncloud keypoints after training and can be fast adapted to downstream tasks\nincluding classification and segmentation by the pre-training and fine-tuning\nparadigm. Extensive experiments on two datasets show that the encoder + ours\n(MD) significantly surpasses that of the encoder trained from scratch and\nconverges quickly. In ablation studies, we further study the effect of each\ncomponent and discuss the advantages of the proposed self-supervised learning\nstrategy. We hope this self-supervised learning attempt on point clouds can\npave the way for reducing the deeply-learned model dependence on large-scale\nlabeled data and saving a lot of annotation costs in the future.",

    "abstract": "Surface cracks are a common sight on public infrastructure nowadays. Recent\nwork has been addressing this problem by supporting structural maintenance\nmeasures using machine learning methods which segment surface cracks from their\nbackground so that they are easy to localize. However, a common issue with\nthose methods is that to create a well functioning algorithm, the training data\nneeds to have detailed annotations of pixels that belong to cracks. Our work\nproposes a weakly supervised approach which leverages a CNN classifier to\ncreate surface crack segmentation maps. We use this classifier to create a\nrough crack localisation map by using its class activation maps and a patch\nbased classification approach and fuse this with a thresholding based approach\nto segment the mostly darker crack pixels. The classifier assists in\nsuppressing noise from the background regions, which commonly are incorrectly\nhighlighted as cracks by standard thresholding methods. We focus on the ease of\nimplementation of our method and it is shown to perform well on several surface\ncrack datasets, segmenting cracks efficiently even though the only data that\nwas used for training were simple classification labels.",

Given a source face image and a sequence of sparse face\nlandmarks, our goal is to generate a video of the face imitating the motion of\nlandmarks. We develop an efficient and effective method for motion transfer\nfrom sparse landmarks to the face image. We then combine global and local\nmotion estimation in a unified model to faithfully transfer the motion. The\nmodel can learn to segment the moving foreground from the background and\ngenerate not only global motion, such as rotation and translation of the face,\nbut also subtle local motion such as the gaze change. We further improve face\nlandmark detection on videos. With temporally better aligned landmark sequences\nfor training, our method can generate temporally coherent videos with higher\nvisual quality. Experiments suggest we achieve results comparable to the\nstate-of-the-art image driven method on the same identity testing and better\nresults on cross identity testing.",

    "abstract": "Modern processor designs use a variety of microarchitectural methods to\nachieve high performance. Unfortunately, new side-channels have often been\nuncovered that exploit these enhanced designs. One area that has received\nlittle attention from a security perspective is the processor's hard-ware\nprefetcher, a critical component used to mitigate DRAM latency in today's\nsystems. Prefetchers, like branch predictors, hold critical state related to\nthe execution of the application, and have the potential to leak secret\ninformation. But up to now, there has not been a demonstration of a generic\nprefetcher side-channel that could be actively exploited in today's hardware.\nIn this paper, we present AfterImage, a new side-channel that exploits the\nIntel Instruction Pointer-based stride prefetcher. We observe that, when the\nexecution of the processor switches between different private domains, the\nprefetcher trained by one domain can be triggered in another. To the best of\nour knowledge, this work is the first to publicly demonstrate a methodology\nthat is both algorithm-agnostic and also able to leak kernel data into\nuserspace. AfterImage is different from previous works, as it leaks data on the\nnon-speculative path of execution. Because of this, a large class of work that\nhas focused on protecting transient, branch-outcome-based data will be unable\nto block this side-channel. By reverse-engineering the IP-stride prefetcher in\nmodern Intel processors, we have successfully developed three variants of\nAfterImage to leak control flow information across code regions, processes and\nthe user-kernel boundary. We find a high level of accuracy in leaking\ninformation with our methodology (from 91%, up to 99%), and propose two\nmitigation techniques to block this side-channel, one of which can be used on\nhardware systems today.",

Such an approach requires making minimal changes to the\noriginal code and enables a smooth migration of large-scale nuclear structure\nsimulations from a distributed-memory many-core CPU system to a distributed GPU\nsystem. However, in order to make the OpenACC based eigensolver run efficiently\non GPUs, we need to take into account the architectural differences between a\nmany-core CPU and a GPU device. Consequently, the optimal way to insert OpenACC\ndirectives may be different from the original way of inserting OpenMP\ndirectives. We point out these differences in the implementation of sparse\nmatrix-matrix multiplications (SpMM), which constitutes the main cost of the\neigensolver, as well as other differences in the preconditioning step and dense\nlinear algebra operations. We compare the performance of the OpenACC based\nimplementation executed on multiple GPUs with the performance on\ndistributed-memory many-core CPUs, and demonstrate significant speedup achieved\non GPUs compared to the on-node performance of a many-core CPU.

    "abstract": "Commercial quantum annealers from D-Wave Systems can find high quality\nsolutions of quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems that can be\nembedded onto its hardware. However, even though such devices currently offer\nup to 2048 qubits, due to limitations on the connectivity of those qubits, the\nsize of problems that can typically be solved is rather small (around 65\nvariables). This limitation poses a problem for using D-Wave machines to solve\napplication-relevant problems, which can have thousands of variables. For the\nimportant Maximum Clique problem, this article investigates methods for\ndecomposing larger problem instances into smaller ones, which can subsequently\nbe solved on D-Wave. During the decomposition, we aim to prune as many\ngenerated subproblems that do not contribute to the solution as possible, in\norder to reduce the computational complexity.

In this\ncontribution, we study how such features can help in improving the quality of\nthe solutions returned by the annealer. Specifically, we focus on two of these\nfeatures: reverse annealing and h-gain. Reverse annealing (RA) was designed to\nallow refining a known solution by backward annealing from a classical state\nrepresenting the solution to a mid-anneal point where a transverse field is\npresent, followed by an ordinary forward anneal, which is hoped to improve on\nthe previous solution. The h-gain (HG) feature stands for time-dependent gain\nin Hamiltonian linear ($h$) biases and was originally developed to help study\nfreezeout times and phase transitions in spin glasses. Here we apply HG to bias\nthe quantum state in the beginning of the annealing process towards the known\nsolution as in the RA case, but using a different apparatus. We also\ninvestigate a hybrid reverse annealing/h-gain schedule, which has a backward\nphase resembling an RA step and whose forward phase uses the HG idea. To\noptimize the parameters of the schedules, we employ a Bayesian optimization\nframework.

To enable low-latency cooperative\ninference, we propose a learning-based communication scheme that optimizes\nlocal feature extraction and distributed feature encoding in a task-oriented\nmanner, i.e., to remove data redundancy and transmit information that is\nessential for the downstream inference task rather than reconstructing the data\nsamples at the edge server.

To admit flexible control of the communication\noverhead, we extend the DIB framework to a distributed deterministic\ninformation bottleneck (DDIB) objective that explicitly incorporates the\nrepresentational costs of the encoded features. As the IB-based objectives are\ncomputationally prohibitive for high-dimensional data, we adopt variational\napproximations to make the optimization problems tractable.

    "abstract": "The properties of a thermally sprayed coating, such as its durability or\nthermal conductivity depend on its microstructure, which is in turn directly\nrelated to the particle impact process. To simulate this process we present a\n3D Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) model, which represents the molten\ndroplet as an incompressible fluid, while a semi-implicit Enthalpy-Porosity\nmethod is applied for the mushy zone during solidification. In addition, we\npresent an implicit correction for SPH simulations, based on well known\napproaches, from which we can observe improved performance and simulation\nstability. We apply our SPH method to the impact and solidification of\nAl$_2$O$_3$ droplets onto a free slip substrate and perform a rigorous\nquantitative comparison of our method with the commercial software Ansys Fluent\nusing the Volume of Fluid (VOF) approach, while taking identical physical\neffects into consideration. The results are evaluated in depth and we discuss\nthe applicability of either method for the simulation of thermal spray\ndeposition. We show that SPH is an excellent method for solving this free\nsurface problem accurately and efficiently.",

Due to the vigorous development of deep learning and\nthe widespread attention of researchers, several non-reference image quality\nassessment methods based on deep learning have been proposed in recent years,\nand some have exceeded the performance of reduced -reference or even\nfull-reference image quality assessment models. This article will review the\nconcepts and metrics of image quality assessment and also video quality\nassessment, briefly introduce some methods of full-reference and semi-reference\nimage quality assessment, and focus on the non-reference image quality\nassessment methods based on deep learning.

Even though decentralized control\narchitectures offer advantages in terms of communication, maintenance costs,\nand scalability, it is an open question how communication latency that varies\nwith network topology influences closed-loop performance. For networks in which\ndelays increase with the number of links, we establish the existence of a\nfundamental performance trade-off that arises from control architecture. In\nparticular, we utilize consensus dynamics with single- and double-integrator\nagents to show that, if delays increase fast enough, a sparse controller with\nnearest neighbor interactions can outperform the centralized one with\nall-to-all communication topology.",

    "abstract": "Type-B Aortic Dissection (TBAD) is one of the most serious cardiovascular\nevents characterized by a growing yearly incidence,and the severity of disease\nprognosis. Currently, computed tomography angiography (CTA) has been widely\nadopted for the diagnosis and prognosis of TBAD. Accurate segmentation of true\nlumen (TL), false lumen (FL), and false lumen thrombus (FLT) in CTA are crucial\nfor the precise quantification of anatomical features. However, existing works\nonly focus on only TL and FL without considering FLT. In this paper, we propose\nImageTBAD, the first 3D computed tomography angiography (CTA) image dataset of\nTBAD with annotation of TL, FL, and FLT. The proposed dataset contains 100 TBAD\nCTA images, which is of decent size compared with existing medical imaging\ndatasets. As FLT can appear almost anywhere along the aorta with irregular\nshapes, segmentation of FLT presents a wide class of segmentation problems\nwhere targets exist in a variety of positions with irregular shapes. We further\npropose a baseline method for automatic segmentation of TBAD. Results show that\nthe baseline method can achieve comparable results with existing works on aorta\nand TL segmentation. However, the segmentation accuracy of FLT is only 52%,\nwhich leaves large room for improvement and also shows the challenge of our\ndataset. To facilitate further research on this challenging problem, our\ndataset and codes are released to the public.",

    "title": "An Integrated Framework for the Heterogeneous Spatio-Spectral-Temporal  Fusion of Remote Sensing Images",
    "abstract": "Image fusion technology is widely used to fuse the complementary information\nbetween multi-source remote sensing images. Inspired by the frontier of deep\nlearning, this paper first proposes a heterogeneous-integrated framework based\non a novel deep residual cycle GAN. The proposed network consists of a forward\nfusion part and a backward degeneration feedback part. The forward part\ngenerates the desired fusion result from the various observations; the backward\ndegeneration feedback part considers the imaging degradation process and\nregenerates the observations inversely from the fusion result. The proposed\nnetwork can effectively fuse not only the homogeneous but also the\nheterogeneous information. In addition, for the first time, a\nheterogeneous-integrated fusion framework is proposed to simultaneously merge\nthe complementary heterogeneous spatial, spectral and temporal information of\nmulti-source heterogeneous observations. The proposed heterogeneous-integrated\nframework also provides a uniform mode that can complete various fusion tasks,\nincluding heterogeneous spatio-spectral fusion, spatio-temporal fusion, and\nheterogeneous spatio-spectral-temporal fusion. Experiments are conducted for\ntwo challenging scenarios of land cover changes and thick cloud coverage.\nImages from many remote sensing satellites, including MODIS, Landsat-8,\nSentinel-1, and Sentinel-2, are utilized in the experiments. Both qualitative\nand quantitative evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "Optimal power flow (OPF) is the fundamental mathematical model in power\nsystem operations. Improving the solution quality of OPF provide huge economic\nand engineering benefits. The convex reformulation of the original nonconvex\nalternating current OPF (ACOPF) model gives an efficient way to find the global\noptimal solution of ACOPF but suffers from the relaxation gaps. The existence\nof relaxation gaps hinders the practical application of convex OPF due to the\nAC-infeasibility problem. We evaluate and improve the tightness of the convex\nACOPF model in this paper. Various power networks and nodal loads are\nconsidered in the evaluation. A unified evaluation framework is implemented in\nJulia programming language. This evaluation shows the sensitivity of the\nrelaxation gap and helps to benchmark the proposed tightness reinforcement\napproach (TRA). The proposed TRA is based on the penalty function method which\npenalizes the power loss relaxation in the objective function of the convex\nACOPF model. A heuristic penalty algorithm is proposed to find the proper\npenalty parameter of the TRA. Numerical results show relaxation gaps exist in\ntest cases especially for large-scale power networks under low nodal power\nloads. TRA is effective to reduce the relaxation gap of the convex ACOPF model.",

    "abstract": "Current unsupervised anomaly localization approaches rely on generative\nmodels to learn the distribution of normal images, which is later used to\nidentify potential anomalous regions derived from errors on the reconstructed\nimages. However, a main limitation of nearly all prior literature is the need\nof employing anomalous images to set a class-specific threshold to locate the\nanomalies. This limits their usability in realistic scenarios, where only\nnormal data is typically accessible. Despite this major drawback, only a\nhandful of works have addressed this limitation, by integrating supervision on\nattention maps during training. In this work, we propose a novel formulation\nthat does not require accessing images with abnormalities to define the\nthreshold. Furthermore, and in contrast to very recent work, the proposed\nconstraint is formulated in a more principled manner, leveraging well-known\nknowledge in constrained optimization. In particular, the equality constraint\non the attention maps in prior work is replaced by an inequality constraint,\nwhich allows more flexibility. In addition, to address the limitations of\npenalty-based functions we employ an extension of the popular log-barrier\nmethods to handle the constraint. Comprehensive experiments on the popular\nBRATS'19 dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach substantially\noutperforms relevant literature, establishing new state-of-the-art results for\nunsupervised lesion segmentation.",
