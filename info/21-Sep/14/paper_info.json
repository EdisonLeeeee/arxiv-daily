    "title": "Potential-based Reward Shaping in Sokoban",
    "abstract": "Learning to solve sparse-reward reinforcement learning problems is difficult,\ndue to the lack of guidance towards the goal. But in some problems, prior\nknowledge can be used to augment the learning process. Reward shaping is a way\nto incorporate prior knowledge into the original reward function in order to\nspeed up the learning. While previous work has investigated the use of expert\nknowledge to generate potential functions, in this work, we study whether we\ncan use a search algorithm(A*) to automatically generate a potential function\nfor reward shaping in Sokoban, a well-known planning task. The results showed\nthat learning with shaped reward function is faster than learning from scratch.\nOur results indicate that distance functions could be a suitable function for\nSokoban. This work demonstrates the possibility of solving multiple instances\nwith the help of reward shaping. The result can be compressed into a single\npolicy, which can be seen as the first phrase towards training a general policy\nthat is able to solve unseen instances.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the fast replanning problem in dynamic environments with\nmoving obstacles. Since for randomly moving obstacles the future states are\nunpredictable, the proposed method, called SMARRT, reacts to obstacle motions\nand revises the path in real-time based on the current interfering obstacle\nstate (i.e., position and velocity). SMARRT is fast and efficient and performs\ncollision checking only on the partial path segment close to the robot within a\nfeasibility checking horizon. If the path is infeasible, then tree parts\nassociated with the path inside the horizon are pruned while maintaining the\nmaximal tree structure of already-explored regions. Then, a multi-resolution\nutility map is created to capture the environmental information used to compute\nthe replanning utility for each cell on the multi-scale tiling. A hierarchical\nsearching method is applied on the map to find the sampling cell efficiently.\nFinally, uniform samples are drawn within the sampling cell for fast\nreplanning. The SMARRT method is validated via simulation runs, and the results\nare evaluated in comparison to four existing methods. The SMARRT method yields\nsignificant improvements in travel time, replanning time, and success rate\ncompared against the existing methods.",

However, this type migration\nprocess is typically a manual effort with limited tool support. This paper\nexamines the problem of \\emph{automated type migration}: given a dynamic\nprogram, infer additional or improved type annotations.\nExisting type migration algorithms prioritize different goals, such as\nmaximizing type precision, maintaining compatibility with unmigrated code, and\npreserving the semantics of the original program. We argue that the type\nmigration problem involves fundamental compromises: optimizing for a single\ngoal often comes at the expense of others. Ideally, a type migration tool would\nflexibly accommodate a range of user priorities.\nWe present TypeWhich, a new approach to automated type migration for the\ngradually-typed lambda calculus with some extensions. Unlike prior work, which\nrelies on custom solvers, TypeWhich produces constraints for an off-the-shelf\nMaxSMT solver. This allows us to easily express objectives, such as minimizing\nthe number of necessary syntactic coercions, and constraining the type of the\nmigration to be compatible with unmigrated code.\nWe present the first comprehensive evaluation of GTLC type migration\nalgorithms, and compare TypeWhich to four other tools from the literature. Our\nevaluation uses prior benchmarks, and a new set of ``challenge problems.''\nMoreover, we design a new evaluation methodology that highlights the subtleties\nof gradual type migration.

One mechanism that has\nbecome a centerpiece of global efforts to regulate government algorithms is to\nrequire human oversight of algorithmic decisions. However, the functional\nquality of this regulatory approach has not been thoroughly interrogated. In\nthis article, I survey 40 policies that prescribe human oversight of government\nalgorithms and find that they suffer from two significant flaws. First,\nevidence suggests that people are unable to perform the desired oversight\nfunctions. Second, human oversight policies legitimize government use of flawed\nand controversial algorithms without addressing the fundamental issues with\nthese tools. Thus, rather than protect against the potential harms of\nalgorithmic decision-making in government, human oversight policies provide a\nfalse sense of security in adopting algorithms and enable vendors and agencies\nto shirk accountability for algorithmic harms. In light of these flaws, I\npropose a more rigorous approach for determining whether and how to incorporate\nalgorithms into government decision-making. First, policymakers must critically\nconsider whether it is appropriate to use an algorithm at all in a specific\ncontext. Second, before deploying an algorithm alongside human oversight,\nvendors or agencies must conduct preliminary evaluations of whether people can\neffectively oversee the algorithm.",

To alleviate these\nperception costs, we develop a novel simultaneous perception-action design\nframework wherein an agent senses only the task-relevant information. This\nformulation differs from that of a partially observable Markov decision\nprocess, since the agent is free to synthesize not only its policy for action\nselection but also its belief-dependent observation function. The method\nenables the agent to balance its perception costs with those incurred by\noperating in its environment. To obtain a computationally tractable solution,\nwe approximate the value function using a novel method of invariant finite\nbelief sets, wherein the agent acts exclusively on a finite subset of the\ncontinuous belief space. We solve the approximate problem through value\niteration in which a linear program is solved individually for each belief\nstate in the set, in each iteration. Finally, we prove that the value\nfunctions, under an assumption on their structure, converge to their continuous\nstate-space values as the sample density increases.",

    "abstract": "We focus on the problem of planning safe and efficient motion for a ballbot\n(i.e., a dynamically balancing mobile robot), navigating in a crowded\nenvironment. The ballbot's design gives rise to human-readable motion which is\nvaluable for crowd navigation. However, dynamic stabilization introduces\nkinematic constraints that severely limit the ability of the robot to execute\naggressive maneuvers, complicating collision avoidance and respect for human\npersonal space. Past works reduce the need for aggressive maneuvering by\nmotivating anticipatory collision avoidance through the use of human motion\nprediction models. However, multiagent behavior prediction is hard due to the\ncombinatorial structure of the space. Our key insight is that we can accomplish\nanticipatory multiagent collision avoidance without high-fidelity prediction\nmodels if we capture fundamental features of multiagent dynamics. To this end,\nwe build a model predictive control architecture that employs a\nconstant-velocity model of human motion prediction but monitors and proactively\nadapts to the unfolding homotopy class of crowd-robot dynamics by taking\nactions that maximize the pairwise winding numbers between the robot and each\nhuman agent. This results in robot motion that accomplishes statistically\nsignificantly higher clearances from the crowd compared to state-of-the-art\nbaselines while maintaining similar levels of efficiency, across a variety of\nchallenging physical scenarios and crowd simulators.",

Often the usefulness of the findings\nfrom the use of these techniques is reduced due to lack of method\ninterpretability. Some recent progress made on the interpretability of machine\nlearning models has the potential to unravel more insights while using\nconventional machine learning models. In this work, we analyze COVID-19 blood\nwork data with some of the popular machine learning models; then we employ\nstate-of-the-art post-hoc local interpretability techniques(e.g.- SHAP, LIME),\nand global interpretability techniques(e.g. - symbolic metamodeling) to the\ntrained black-box models to draw interpretable conclusions. In the gamut of\nmachine learning algorithms, regressions remain one of the simplest and most\nexplainable models with clear mathematical formulation. We explore one of the\nmost recent techniques called symbolic metamodeling to find the mathematical\nexpression of the machine learning models for COVID-19. We identify Acute\nKidney Injury (AKI), initial Albumin level (ALBI), Aspartate aminotransferase\n(ASTI), Total Bilirubin initial(TBILI) and D-Dimer initial (DIMER) as major\nprognostic factors of the disease severity. Our contributions are- (i) uncover\nthe underlying mathematical expression for the black-box models on COVID-19\nseverity prediction task (ii) we are the first to apply symbolic metamodeling\nto this task, and (iii) discover important features and feature interactions.",

However,\nsuch (neural) dialog models have been criticized for generating responses which\nalthough may have relevance to the previous human response, tend to quickly\ndissipate human interest and descend into trivial conversation. One reason for\nsuch performance is the lack of explicit conversation strategy being employed\nin human-machine conversation.

    "abstract": "Dynamical systems are ubiquitous and are often modeled using a non-linear\nsystem of governing equations. Numerical solution procedures for many dynamical\nsystems have existed for several decades, but can be slow due to\nhigh-dimensional state space of the dynamical system. Thus, deep learning-based\nreduced order models (ROMs) are of interest and one such family of algorithms\nalong these lines are based on the Koopman theory. This paper extends a\nrecently developed adversarial Koopman model (Balakrishnan \\& Upadhyay,\narXiv:2006.05547) to stochastic space, where the Koopman operator applies on\nthe probability distribution of the latent encoding of an encoder.\nSpecifically, the latent encoding of the system is modeled as a Gaussian, and\nis advanced in time by using an auxiliary neural network that outputs two\nKoopman matrices $K_{\\mu}$ and $K_{\\sigma}$. Adversarial and gradient losses\nare used and this is found to lower the prediction errors. A reduced Koopman\nformulation is also undertaken where the Koopman matrices are assumed to have a\ntridiagonal structure, and this yields predictions comparable to the baseline\nmodel with full Koopman matrices. The efficacy of the stochastic Koopman model\nis demonstrated on different test problems in chaos, fluid dynamics,\ncombustion, and reaction-diffusion models. The proposed model is also applied\nin a setting where the Koopman matrices are conditioned on other input\nparameters for generalization and this is applied to simulate the state of a\nLithium-ion battery in time. The Koopman models discussed in this study are\nvery promising for the wide range of problems considered.",

    "abstract": "Many off-policy prediction learning algorithms have been proposed in the past\ndecade, but it remains unclear which algorithms learn faster than others. We\nempirically compare 11 off-policy prediction learning algorithms with linear\nfunction approximation on two small tasks: the Rooms task, and the High\nVariance Rooms task. The tasks are designed such that learning fast in them is\nchallenging. In the Rooms task, the product of importance sampling ratios can\nbe as large as $2^{14}$ and can sometimes be two. To control the high variance\ncaused by the product of the importance sampling ratios, step size should be\nset small, which in turn slows down learning. The High Variance Rooms task is\nmore extreme in that the product of the ratios can become as large as\n$2^{14}\\times 25$. This paper builds upon the empirical study of off-policy\nprediction learning algorithms by Ghiassian and Sutton (2021). We consider the\nsame set of algorithms as theirs and employ the same experimental methodology.\nThe algorithms considered are: Off-policy TD($\\lambda$), five Gradient-TD\nalgorithms, two Emphatic-TD algorithms, Tree Backup($\\lambda$),\nVtrace($\\lambda$), and ABTD($\\zeta$). We found that the algorithms' performance\nis highly affected by the variance induced by the importance sampling ratios.\nThe data shows that Tree Backup($\\lambda$), Vtrace($\\lambda$), and\nABTD($\\zeta$) are not affected by the high variance as much as other algorithms\nbut they restrict the effective bootstrapping parameter in a way that is too\nlimiting for tasks where high variance is not present. We observed that\nEmphatic TD($\\lambda$) tends to have lower asymptotic error than other\nalgorithms, but might learn more slowly in some cases. We suggest algorithms\nfor practitioners based on their problem of interest, and suggest approaches\nthat can be applied to specific algorithms that might result in substantially\nimproved algorithms.",

More importantly, it considerably improves\nperformance on under-resourced languages, showing that text-text learning can\novercome a paucity of image-caption examples for these languages. On the\nWikipedia Image-Text dataset, for example, MURAL-base improves zero-shot mean\nrecall by 8.1% on average for eight under-resourced languages and by 6.8% on\naverage when fine-tuning. We additionally show that MURAL's text\nrepresentations cluster not only with respect to genealogical connections but\nalso based on areal linguistics, such as the Balkan Sprachbund.",

This work addresses that gap by\nfocusing on extracting explanations that indicate that a relation exists while\nusing only partially labeled data. We propose our model-agnostic framework,\nD-REX, a policy-guided semi-supervised algorithm that explains and ranks\nrelations. We frame relation extraction as a re-ranking task and include\nrelation- and entity-specific explanations as an intermediate step of the\ninference process. We find that about 90% of the time, human annotators prefer\nD-REX's explanations over a strong BERT-based joint relation extraction and\nexplanation model. Finally, our evaluations on a dialogue relation extraction\ndataset show that our method is simple yet effective and achieves a\nstate-of-the-art F1 score on relation extraction, improving upon existing\nmethods by 13.5%.",

    "abstract": "Motion planning for autonomous robots and vehicles in presence of\nuncontrolled agents remains a challenging problem as the reactive behaviors of\nthe uncontrolled agents must be considered. Since the uncontrolled agents\nusually demonstrate multimodal reactive behavior, the motion planner needs to\nsolve a continuous motion planning problem under multimodal behaviors of the\nuncontrolled agents, which contains a discrete element. We propose a branch\nModel Predictive Control (MPC) framework that plans over feedback policies to\nleverage the reactive behavior of the uncontrolled agent. In particular, a\nscenario tree is constructed from a finite set of policies of the uncontrolled\nagent, and the branch MPC solves for a feedback policy in the form of a\ntrajectory tree, which shares the same topology as the scenario tree. Moreover,\ncoherent risk measures such as the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) are used as\na tuning knob to adjust the tradeoff between performance and robustness. The\nproposed branch MPC framework is tested on an \\textit{overtake and lane change}\ntask and a \\textit{merging} task for autonomous vehicles in simulation, and on\nthe motion planning of an autonomous quadruped robot alongside an uncontrolled\nquadruped in experiments. The result demonstrates interesting human-like\nbehaviors, achieving a balance between safety and performance.",

To reduce the effect of network configuration on\nlocalization error for moving networks we consider various optimality measures\nof the Fisher information matrix (FIM), which have well-studied relationships\nwith the localization error. In particular, we pose a trajectory planning\nproblem with constraints on the FIM optimality measures.

To efficiently generate trajectories which satisfy these\nFIM constraints we present a prioritized planner which leverages graph-based\nplanning and unique properties of the range-only FIM.

    "abstract": "Home automation in modern smart home platforms is often facilitated using\ntrigger-action routines. While such routines enable flexible automation, they\nalso lead to an instance of the integrity problem in these systems: untrusted\nthird-parties may use platform APIs to modify the abstract home objects (AHOs)\nthat privileged, high-integrity devices such as security cameras rely on (i.e.,\nas triggers), thereby transitively attacking them. As most accesses to AHOs are\nlegitimate, removing the permissions or applying naive information flow\ncontrols would not only fail to prevent these problems, but also break useful\nfunctionality. Therefore, this paper proposes the alternate approach of home\nabstraction endorsement, which endorses a proposed change to an AHO by\ncorrelating it with certain specific, preceding, environmental changes. We\npresent the HomeEndorser framework, which provides a policy model for\nspecifying endorsement policies for AHOs as changes in device states, relative\nto their location, and a platform-based reference monitor for mediating all API\nrequests to change AHOs against those device states. We evaluate HomeEndorser\non the HomeAssistant platform, finding that we can derive over 1000 policy\nrules for HomeEndorser to endorse changes to 6 key AHOs, preventing malice and\naccidents for less than 10% overhead for endorsement check microbenchmarks, and\nwith no false alarms under realistic usage scenarios. In doing so, HomeEndorser\nlays the first steps towards providing a practical foundation for ensuring that\nAPI-induced changes to abstract home objects correlate with the physical\nrealities of the user's environment.",

We define discovery processes where at each state there is an\nextensive-form game with unawareness that together with the players' play\ndetermines the transition to possibly another extensive-form game with\nunawareness in which players are now aware of actions that they have\ndiscovered. A discovery process is rationalizable if players play\nextensive-form rationalizable strategies in each game with unawareness. We show\nthat for any game with unawareness there is a rationalizable discovery process\nthat leads to a self-confirming game that possesses a self-confirming\nequilibrium in extensive-form rationalizable conjectures.

First, for any $n$-node graph $G$ with hop-diameter $D$ and\ntreewidth bounded by $k$, we show the existence of a Laplacian solver with\nround complexity $O(n^{o(1)}kD \\log(1/\\epsilon))$ in the CONGEST model. For\ngraphs with bounded treewidth this circumvents the notorious $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$\nlower bound for \"global\" problems in general graphs. Moreover, following a\nrecent line of work in distributed algorithms, we consider a hybrid\ncommunication model which enhances CONGEST with very limited global power in\nthe form of the recently introduced node-capacitated clique. In this model, we\nshow the existence of a Laplacian solver with round complexity $O(n^{o(1)}\n\\log(1/\\epsilon))$. The unifying thread of these results is an application of\naccelerated distributed algorithms for a congested variant of the standard\npart-wise aggregation problem that we introduce.

Table understanding methods aim at\ndetecting a table's topic, semantic column types, column relations, or\nentities. With the rise of deep learning, powerful models have been developed\nfor these tasks with excellent accuracy on benchmarks. However, we observe that\nthere exists a gap between the performance of these models on these benchmarks\nand their applicability in practice. In this paper, we address the question:\nwhat do we need for these models to work in practice?\nWe discuss three challenges of deploying table understanding models and\npropose a framework to address them. These challenges include 1) difficulty in\ncustomizing models to specific domains, 2) lack of training data for typical\ndatabase tables often found in enterprises, and 3) lack of confidence in the\ninferences made by models. We present SigmaTyper which implements this\nframework for the semantic column type detection task.

Although memes are typically humorous,\nrecent days have witnessed an escalation of harmful memes used for trolling,\ncyberbullying, and abusing social entities. Detecting such harmful memes is\nchallenging as they can be highly satirical and cryptic. Moreover, while\nprevious work has focused on specific aspects of memes such as hate speech and\npropaganda, there has been little work on harm in general, and only one\nspecialized dataset for it. Here, we focus on bridging this gap. In particular,\nwe aim to solve two novel tasks: detecting harmful memes and identifying the\nsocial entities they target. We further extend the recently released HarMeme\ndataset to generalize on two prevalent topics - COVID-19 and US politics and\nname the two datasets as Harm-C and Harm-P, respectively. We then propose\nMOMENTA (MultimOdal framework for detecting harmful MemEs aNd Their tArgets), a\nnovel multimodal (text + image) deep neural model, which uses global and local\nperspectives to detect harmful memes.

    "abstract": "How human behavior is influenced by a social network that they belong has\nbeen an interested topic in applied research. Existing methods often utilized\nscale-level behavioral data to estimate the influence of a social network on\nhuman behavior. This study proposes a novel approach to studying social\ninfluence by using item-level behavioral measures. Under the latent space\nmodeling framework, we integrate the two latent spaces for respondents' social\nnetwork data and item-level behavior measures. We then measure social influence\nas the impact of the latent space configuration contributed by the social\nnetwork data on the behavior data. The performance and properties of the\nproposed approach are evaluated via simulation studies. We apply the proposed\nmodel to an empirical dataset to explain how students' friendship network\ninfluences their participation in school activities.",

    "abstract": "Training robust supervised deep learning models for many geospatial\napplications of computer vision is difficult due to dearth of class-balanced\nand diverse training data. Conversely, obtaining enough training data for many\napplications is financially prohibitive or may be infeasible, especially when\nthe application involves modeling rare or extreme events. Synthetically\ngenerating data (and labels) using a generative model that can sample from a\ntarget distribution and exploit the multi-scale nature of images can be an\ninexpensive solution to address scarcity of labeled data. Towards this goal, we\npresent a deep conditional generative model, called VAE-Info-cGAN, that\ncombines a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a conditional Information\nMaximizing Generative Adversarial Network (InfoGAN), for synthesizing\nsemantically rich images simultaneously conditioned on a pixel-level condition\n(PLC) and a macroscopic feature-level condition (FLC). Dimensionally, the PLC\ncan only vary in the channel dimension from the synthesized image and is meant\nto be a task-specific input. The FLC is modeled as an attribute vector in the\nlatent space of the generated image which controls the contributions of various\ncharacteristic attributes germane to the target distribution. Experiments on a\nGPS trajectories dataset show that the proposed model can accurately generate\nvarious forms of spatiotemporal aggregates across different geographic\nlocations while conditioned only on a raster representation of the road\nnetwork. The primary intended application of the VAE-Info-cGAN is synthetic\ndata (and label) generation for targeted data augmentation for computer\nvision-based modeling of problems relevant to geospatial analysis and remote\nsensing.",

    "abstract": "Currently, most existing approaches for the design of Automated Driving\nSystem (ADS) scenarios focus on the description at one particular abstraction\nlevel typically the most detailed one. This practice often removes information\nat higher levels, such that this data has to be re-synthesized if needed. As\nthe abstraction granularity should be adapted to the task at hand, however,\nengineers currently have the choice between re-calculating the needed data or\noperating on the wrong level of abstraction. For instance, the search in a\nscenario database for a driving scenario with a map of a given road-shape\nshould abstract over the lane markings, adjacent vegetation, or weather\nsituation. Often though, the general road shape has to be synthesized (e.g.\ninterpolated) from the precise GPS information of road boundaries. This paper\noutlines our vision for multi-level ADS scenario models that facilitate\nscenario search, generation, and design. Our concept is based on the common\nmodelling philosophy to interact with scenarios at the most appropriate\nabstraction level. We identify different abstraction levels of ADS scenarios\nand suggest a template abstraction hierarchy. Our vision enables seamless\ntraversal to such a most suitable granularity level for any given scenario,\nsearch and modelling task.

First,\npowerful DNNs often come at prohibitive complexities, whereas IoT devices often\nsuffer from stringent resource constraints.

    "abstract": "Traffic flow forecasting is a crucial task in urban computing. The challenge\narises as traffic flows often exhibit intrinsic and latent spatio-temporal\ncorrelations that cannot be identified by extracting the spatial and temporal\npatterns of traffic data separately. We argue that such correlations are\nuniversal and play a pivotal role in traffic flow. We put forward spacetime\ninterval learning as a paradigm to explicitly capture these correlations\nthrough a unified analysis of both spatial and temporal features. Unlike the\nstate-of-the-art methods, which are restricted to a particular road network, we\nmodel the universal spatio-temporal correlations that are transferable from\ncities to cities. To this end, we propose a new spacetime interval learning\nframework that constructs a local-spacetime context of a traffic sensor\ncomprising the data from its neighbors within close time points. Based on this\nidea, we introduce spacetime neural network (STNN), which employs novel\nspacetime convolution and attention mechanism to learn the universal\nspatio-temporal correlations. The proposed STNN captures local traffic\npatterns, which does not depend on a specific network structure. As a result, a\ntrained STNN model can be applied on any unseen traffic networks. We evaluate\nthe proposed STNN on two public real-world traffic datasets and a simulated\ndataset on dynamic networks. The experiment results show that STNN not only\nimproves prediction accuracy by 15% over state-of-the-art methods, but is also\neffective in handling the case when the traffic network undergoes dynamic\nchanges as well as the superior generalization capability.",

Such methods are expensive in\nenforcing compliance to traffic rules and do not scale to large road networks.\nThis paper proposes a simple mobile imaging setup to address several common\nproblems in road safety at scale. We use recent computer vision techniques to\nidentify possible irregularities on roads, the absence of street lights, and\ndefective traffic signs using videos from a moving camera-mounted vehicle.\nBeyond the inspection of static road infrastructure, we also demonstrate the\nmobile imaging solution's applicability to spot traffic violations. Before\ndeploying our system in the real-world, we investigate the strengths and\nshortcomings of computer vision techniques on thirteen condition-based\nhierarchical labels. These conditions include different timings, road type,\ntraffic density, and state of road damage. Our demonstrations are then carried\nout on 2000 km of unconstrained road scenes, captured across an entire city.\nThrough this, we quantitatively measure the overall safety of roads in the city\nthrough carefully constructed metrics. We also show an interactive dashboard\nfor visually inspecting and initiating action in a time, labor and\ncost-efficient manner. Code, models, and datasets used in this work will be\npublicly released.",

    "title": "Learning Statistical Representation with Joint Deep Embedded Clustering",
    "abstract": "One of the most promising approaches for unsupervised learning is combining\ndeep representation learning and deep clustering. Some recent works propose to\nsimultaneously learn representation using deep neural networks and perform\nclustering by defining a clustering loss on top of embedded features. However,\nthese approaches are sensitive to imbalanced data and out-of-distribution\nsamples. Hence, these methods optimize clustering by pushing data close to\nrandomly initialized cluster centers. This is problematic when the number of\ninstances varies largely in different classes or a cluster with few samples has\nless chance to be assigned a good centroid. To overcome these limitations, we\nintroduce StatDEC, a new unsupervised framework for joint statistical\nrepresentation learning and clustering. StatDEC simultaneously trains two deep\nlearning models, a deep statistics network that captures the data distribution,\nand a deep clustering network that learns embedded features and performs\nclustering by explicitly defining a clustering loss. Specifically, the\nclustering network and representation network both take advantage of our\nproposed statistics pooling layer that represents mean, variance, and\ncardinality to handle the out-of-distribution samples as well as a class\nimbalance. Our experiments show that using these representations, one can\nconsiderably improve results on imbalanced image clustering across a variety of\nimage datasets. Moreover, the learned representations generalize well when\ntransferred to the out-of-distribution dataset.",

In this paper, we propose a unified\nnews recommendation framework, which can utilize user data locally stored in\nuser clients to train models and serve users in a privacy-preserving way.\nFollowing a widely used paradigm in real-world recommender systems, our\nframework contains two stages. The first one is for candidate news generation\n(i.e., recall) and the second one is for candidate news ranking (i.e.,\nranking). At the recall stage, each client locally learns multiple interest\nrepresentations from clicked news to comprehensively model user interests.\nThese representations are uploaded to the server to recall candidate news from\na large news pool, which are further distributed to the user client at the\nranking stage for personalized news display. In addition, we propose an\ninterest decomposer-aggregator method with perturbation noise to better protect\nprivate user information encoded in user interest representations.

Recent advances in sequential recommenders have\nconvincingly demonstrated high capability in extracting effective user\nrepresentations from the given behavior sequences. Despite significant\nprogress, we argue that solely modeling the observational behaviors sequences\nmay end up with a brittle and unstable system due to the noisy and sparse\nnature of user interactions logged. In this paper, we propose to learn accurate\nand robust user representations, which are required to be less sensitive to\n(attack on) noisy behaviors and trust more on the indispensable ones, by\nmodeling counterfactual data distribution. Specifically, given an observed\nbehavior sequence, the proposed CauseRec framework identifies dispensable and\nindispensable concepts at both the fine-grained item level and the abstract\ninterest level. CauseRec conditionally samples user concept sequences from the\ncounterfactual data distributions by replacing dispensable and indispensable\nconcepts within the original concept sequence. With user representations\nobtained from the synthesized user sequences, CauseRec performs contrastive\nuser representation learning by contrasting the counterfactual with the\nobservational. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world public\nrecommendation benchmarks and justify the effectiveness of CauseRec with\nmulti-aspects model analysis.

    "abstract": "Despite impressive accuracy, deep neural networks are often miscalibrated and\ntend to overly confident predictions. Recent techniques like temperature\nscaling (TS) and label smoothing (LS) show effectiveness in obtaining a\nwell-calibrated model by smoothing logits and hard labels with scalar factors,\nrespectively. However, the use of uniform TS or LS factor may not be optimal\nfor calibrating models trained on a long-tailed dataset where the model\nproduces overly confident probabilities for high-frequency classes. In this\nstudy, we propose class-distribution-aware TS (CDA-TS) and LS (CDA-LS) by\nincorporating class frequency information in model calibration in the context\nof long-tailed distribution. In CDA-TS, the scalar temperature value is\nreplaced with the CDA temperature vector encoded with class frequency to\ncompensate for the over-confidence. Similarly, CDA-LS uses a vector smoothing\nfactor and flattens the hard labels according to their corresponding class\ndistribution. We also integrate CDA optimal temperature vector with\ndistillation loss, which reduces miscalibration in self-distillation (SD). We\nempirically show that class-distribution-aware TS and LS can accommodate the\nimbalanced data distribution yielding superior performance in both calibration\nerror and predictive accuracy. We also observe that SD with an extremely\nimbalanced dataset is less effective in terms of calibration performance.

    "abstract": "Stereoscopy exposits a natural perception of distance in a scene, and its\nmanifestation in 3D world understanding is an intuitive phenomenon. However, an\ninnate rigid calibration of binocular vision sensors is crucial for accurate\ndepth estimation. Alternatively, a monocular camera alleviates the limitation\nat the expense of accuracy in estimating depth, and the challenge exacerbates\nin harsh environmental conditions. Moreover, an optical sensor often fails to\nacquire vital signals in harsh environments, and radar is used instead, which\ngives coarse but more accurate signals. This work explores the utility of\ncoarse signals from radar when fused with fine-grained data from a monocular\ncamera for depth estimation in harsh environmental conditions. A variant of\nfeature pyramid network (FPN) extensively operates on fine-grained image\nfeatures at multiple scales with a fewer number of parameters. FPN feature maps\nare fused with sparse radar features extracted with a Convolutional neural\nnetwork. The concatenated hierarchical features are used to predict the depth\nwith ordinal regression. We performed experiments on the nuScenes dataset, and\nthe proposed architecture stays on top in quantitative evaluations with reduced\nparameters and faster inference. The depth estimation results suggest that the\nproposed techniques can be used as an alternative to stereo depth estimation in\ncritical applications in robotics and self-driving cars.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) allows predictive model training on the sensed data\nin a wireless Internet of things (IoT) network evading data collection cost in\nterms of energy, time, and privacy. In this paper, for a FL setting, we model\nthe learning gain achieved by an IoT device against its participation cost as\nits utility. The local model quality and the associated cost differs from\ndevice to device due to the device-heterogeneity which could be time-varying.\nWe identify that this results in utility unfairness because the same global\nmodel is shared among the devices. In the vanilla FL setting, the master is\nunaware of devices' local model computation and transmission costs, thus it is\nunable to address the utility unfairness problem. In addition, a device may\nexploit this lack of knowledge at the master to intentionally reduce its\nexpenditure and thereby boost its utility. We propose to control the quality of\nthe global model shared with the devices, in each round, based on their\ncontribution and expenditure. This is achieved by employing differential\nprivacy to curtail global model divulgence based on the learning contribution.\nFurthermore, we devise adaptive computation and transmission policies for each\ndevice to control its expenditure in order to mitigate utility unfairness. Our\nresults show that the proposed scheme reduces the standard deviation of the\nenergy cost of devices by 99% in comparison to the benchmark scheme, while the\nstandard deviation of the training loss of devices varies around 0.103.",

While useful,\nsuch statistics are fundamentally limited by the fact that they are derived\nfrom an account of what happened on the field, not how it happened. As a first\nstep towards alleviating this shortcoming, we present a novel, contrastive\nlearning-based framework for describing player form in the MLB. We use form to\nrefer to the way in which a player has impacted the course of play in their\nrecent appearances. Concretely, a player's form is described by a\n72-dimensional vector. By comparing clusters of players resulting from our form\nrepresentations and those resulting from traditional abermetrics, we\ndemonstrate that our form representations contain information about how players\nimpact the course of play, not present in traditional, publicly available\nstatistics.

    "abstract": "Despite the many recent practical and theoretical breakthroughs in\ncomputational game theory, equilibrium finding in extensive-form team games\nremains a significant challenge. While NP-hard in the worst case, there are\nprovably efficient algorithms for certain families of team game. In particular,\nif the game has common external information, also known as A-loss recall --\ninformally, actions played by non-team members (i.e., the opposing team or\nnature) are either unknown to the entire team, or common knowledge within the\nteam -- then polynomial-time algorithms exist (Kaneko and Kline, 1995). In this\npaper, we devise a completely new algorithm for solving team games. It uses a\ntree decomposition of the constraint system representing each team's strategy\nto reduce the number and degree of constraints required for correctness\n(tightness of the mathematical program). Our algorithm reduces the problem of\nsolving team games to a linear program with at most $NW^{w+O(1)}$ nonzero\nentries in the constraint matrix, where $N$ is the size of the game tree, $w$\nis a parameter that depends on the amount of uncommon external information, and\n$W$ is the treewidth of the tree decomposition. In public-action games, our\nprogram size is bounded by the tighter $\\tilde O(3^t 2^{t(n-1)}NW)$ for teams\nof $n$ players with $t$ types each. Since our algorithm describes the polytope\nof correlated strategies directly, we get equilibrium finding in correlated\nstrategies for free -- instead of, say, having to run a double oracle\nalgorithm. We show via experiments on a standard suite of games that our\nalgorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on all benchmark game classes\nexcept one.

Recent\nlines of research focused on extending some of these problems to vertex-labeled\ngraphs, although using ad-hoc approaches which in some cases do not generalize\nto all input graphs. In the absence of a ubiquitous tool like the suffix tree\nfor labeled graphs, we introduce the labeled direct product of two graphs as a\ngeneral tool for obtaining optimal algorithms: we obtain conceptually simpler\nalgorithms for the quadratic problems of string matching (SMLG) and longest\ncommon substring (LCSP) in labeled graphs. Our algorithms are also more\nefficient, since they run in time linear in the size of the labeled product\ngraph, which may be smaller than quadratic for some inputs, and their run-time\nis predictable, because the size of the labeled direct product graph can be\nprecomputed efficiently. We also solve LCSP on graphs containing cycles, which\nwas left as an open problem by Shimohira et al. in 2011.

Compared\nto the state-of-the-art techniques, HyP-ABC is more efficient and has a limited\nnumber of parameters to be tuned, making it worthwhile for real-world\nhyper-parameter optimization problems. We further compare our proposed HyP-ABC\nalgorithm with state-of-the-art techniques. In order to ensure the robustness\nof the proposed method, the algorithm takes a wide range of feasible\nhyper-parameter values, and is tested using a real-world educational dataset.",

    "abstract": "Grasp synthesis for 3D deformable objects remains a little-explored topic,\nmost works aiming to minimize deformations. However, deformations are not\nnecessarily harmful -- humans are, for example, able to exploit deformations to\ngenerate new potential grasps. How to achieve that on a robot is though an open\nquestion. This paper proposes an approach that uses object stiffness\ninformation in addition to depth images for synthesizing high-quality grasps.\nWe achieve this by incorporating object stiffness as an additional input to a\nstate-of-the-art deep grasp planning network. We also curate a new synthetic\ndataset of grasps on objects of varying stiffness using the Isaac Gym simulator\nfor training the network. We experimentally validate and compare our proposed\napproach against the case where we do not incorporate object stiffness on a\ntotal of 2800 grasps in simulation and 420 grasps on a real Franka Emika Panda.\nThe experimental results show significant improvement in grasp success rate\nusing the proposed approach on a wide range of objects with varying shapes,\nsizes, and stiffness. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the approach can\ngenerate different grasping strategies for different stiffness values, such as\npinching for soft objects and caging for hard objects. Together, the results\nclearly show the value of incorporating stiffness information when grasping\nobjects of varying stiffness.",

The central question addressed in this\npaper is whether RZF performs better than the widely-used minimum variance\ndistortionless response and zero-forcing beamformers under\ntemporally-correlated interference. First, RZF is rederived by imposing an\nellipsoidal constraint that bounds the amount of interference leakage for\nmitigating the intrinsic gap between the output variance and the mean squared\nerror (MSE) which stems from the temporal correlations. Second, an analysis of\nRZF is presented for the single-interference case, showing how the MSE is\naffected by the spatio-temporal correlations between the desired and\ninterfering sources as well as by the signal and noise powers. Third, numerical\nstudies are presented for the multiple-interference case, showing the\nremarkable advantages of RZF in its basic performance as well as in its\napplication to brain activity reconstruction from EEG data.

    "abstract": "Multiserver jobs, which are jobs that occupy multiple servers simultaneously\nduring service, are prevalent in today's computing clusters. But little is\nknown about the delay performance of systems with multiserver jobs. We consider\nqueueing models for multiserver jobs in a scaling regime where the total number\nof servers in the system becomes large and meanwhile both the system load and\nthe number of servers that a job needs scale with the total number of servers.\nPrior work has derived upper bounds on the queueing probability in this scaling\nregime. However, without proper lower bounds, the existing results cannot be\nused to differentiate between policies. In this paper, we study the delay\nperformance by establishing sharp bounds on the mean waiting time of\nmultiserver jobs, where the waiting time of a job is the time spent in queueing\nrather than in service. We first consider the commonly used\nFirst-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) policy and characterize the exact order of its\nmean waiting time. We then prove a lower bound on the mean waiting time of all\npolicies, and demonstrate that there is an order gap between this lower bound\nand the mean waiting time under FCFS. We finally complement the lower bound\nwith an achievability result: we show that under a priority policy that we call\nP-Priority, the mean waiting time achieves the order of the lower bound. This\nachievability result implies the tightness of the lower bound, the asymptotic\noptimality of P-Priority, and the strict suboptimality of FCFS.",

Recent observations point to hard disk\nreliability as one of the most pressing reliability issues in data centers\ncontaining massive volumes of storage devices such as HDDs. In this regard,\nearly detection of impending failure at the disk level aids in reducing system\ndowntime and reduces operational loss making proactive health monitoring a\npriority for AIOps in such settings. In this work, we introduce methods of\nextracting meaningful attributes associated with operational failure and of\npre-processing the highly imbalanced health statistics data for subsequent\nprediction tasks using data-driven approaches. We use a Bidirectional LSTM with\na multi-day look back period to learn the temporal progression of health\nindicators and baseline them against vanilla LSTM and Random Forest models to\ncome up with several key metrics that establish the usefulness of and\nsuperiority of our model under some tightly defined operational constraints.\nFor example, using a 15 day look back period, our approach can predict the\noccurrence of disk failure with an accuracy of 96.4% considering test data 60\ndays before failure. This helps to alert operations maintenance well in-advance\nabout potential mitigation needs.

This paper proposes a\nsemantic segmentation network termed as DeepPyram that can achieve superior\nperformance in segmenting relevant objects in cataract surgery videos with\nvarying issues. This superiority mainly originates from three modules: (i)\nPyramid View Fusion, which provides a varying-angle global view of the\nsurrounding region centering at each pixel position in the input convolutional\nfeature map; (ii) Deformable Pyramid Reception, which enables a wide deformable\nreceptive field that can adapt to geometric transformations in the object of\ninterest; and (iii) Pyramid Loss that adaptively supervises multi-scale\nsemantic feature maps. These modules can effectively boost semantic\nsegmentation performance, especially in the case of transparency,\ndeformability, scalability, and blunt edges in objects. The proposed approach\nis evaluated using four datasets of cataract surgery for objects with different\ncontextual features and compared with thirteen state-of-the-art segmentation\nnetworks. The experimental results confirm that DeepPyram outperforms the rival\napproaches without imposing additional trainable parameters.

These\nmethods are well suited for a group of supervised agents trying to solve an\noptimization problem under mild coordination requirements. Each agent has\ninformation on its local cost and coordinates with the network supervisor for\ninformation about the coupling term of the cost. The proposed approach is\nfeedback-based and asynchronous by design, guarantees anytime feasibility, and\nensures the asymptotic convergence of the network state to the desired\noptimizer.

We tackle the task of generating the implicit premise in an\nenthymeme, which requires not only an understanding of the stated conclusion\nand premise but also additional inferences that could depend on commonsense\nknowledge. The largest available dataset for enthymemes (Habernal et al., 2018)\nconsists of 1.7k samples, which is not large enough to train a neural text\ngeneration model. To address this issue, we take advantage of a similar task\nand dataset: Abductive reasoning in narrative text (Bhagavatula et al., 2020).\nHowever, we show that simply using a state-of-the-art seq2seq model fine-tuned\non this data might not generate meaningful implicit premises associated with\nthe given enthymemes.

Though it\nprovides ideal security, FHE is expensive when executed in software, 4 to 5\norders of magnitude slower than computing on unencrypted data. These overheads\nare a major barrier to FHE's widespread adoption. We present F1, the first FHE\naccelerator that is programmable, i.e., capable of executing full FHE programs.\nF1 builds on an in-depth architectural analysis of the characteristics of FHE\ncomputations that reveals acceleration opportunities. F1 is a wide-vector\nprocessor with novel functional units deeply specialized to FHE primitives,\nsuch as modular arithmetic, number-theoretic transforms, and structured\npermutations. This organization provides so much compute throughput that data\nmovement becomes the bottleneck. Thus, F1 is primarily designed to minimize\ndata movement. The F1 hardware provides an explicitly managed memory hierarchy\nand mechanisms to decouple data movement from execution. A novel compiler\nleverages these mechanisms to maximize reuse and schedule off-chip and on-chip\ndata movement. We evaluate F1 using cycle-accurate simulations and RTL\nsynthesis. F1 is the first system to accelerate complete FHE programs and\noutperforms state-of-the-art software implementations by gmean 5400x and by up\nto 17000x.

However, phase-field models suffer from their energy functional\nbeing non-linear and non-convex, while requiring a very fine mesh to capture\nthe damage gradient. This implies a high computational cost, limiting concrete\nengineering applications of the method. In this work, we propose an efficient\nand robust fully monolithic solver for phase-field fracture using a modified\nNewton method with inertia correction and an energy line-search. To illustrate\nthe gains in efficiency obtained with our approach, we compare it to two\npopular methods for phase-field fracture, namely the alternating minimization\nand the quasi-monolithic schemes. To facilitate the evaluation of the time step\ndependent quasi-monolithic scheme, we couple the latter with an extrapolation\ncorrection loop controlled by a damage-based criteria. Finally, we show through\nfour benchmark tests that the modified Newton method we propose is\nstraightforward, robust, and leads to identical solutions, while offering a\nreduction in computation time by factors of up to 12 and 6 when compared to the\nalternating minimization and quasi-monolithic schemes.",

Several\nmodifications have been proposed over the sinusoidal positional encodings used\nin the original transformer architecture; these include, for instance,\nseparating position encodings and token embeddings, or directly modifying\nattention weights based on the distance between word pairs. We first show that\nsurprisingly, while these modifications tend to improve monolingual language\nmodels, none of them result in better multilingual language models. We then\nanswer why that is: Sinusoidal encodings were explicitly designed to facilitate\ncompositionality by allowing linear projections over arbitrary time steps.\nHigher variances in multilingual training distributions requires higher\ncompression, in which case, compositionality becomes indispensable. Learned\nabsolute positional encodings (e.g., in mBERT) tend to approximate sinusoidal\nembeddings in multilingual settings, but more complex positional encoding\narchitectures lack the inductive bias to effectively learn compositionality and\ncross-lingual alignment.

Different loss functions\nimply different learning algorithms and, at times, very different predictors.\nWhile widespread and appealing, a clear drawback of this approach is that the\nloss function may not be known at the time of learning, requiring the algorithm\nto use a best-guess loss function. We suggest a rigorous new paradigm for loss\nminimization in machine learning where the loss function can be ignored at the\ntime of learning and only be taken into account when deciding an action.\nWe introduce the notion of an (${\\mathcal{L}},\\mathcal{C}$)-omnipredictor,\nwhich could be used to optimize any loss in a family ${\\mathcal{L}}$. Once the\nloss function is set, the outputs of the predictor can be post-processed (a\nsimple univariate data-independent transformation of individual predictions) to\ndo well compared with any hypothesis from the class $\\mathcal{C}$. The post\nprocessing is essentially what one would perform if the outputs of the\npredictor were true probabilities of the uncertain events. In a sense,\nomnipredictors extract all the predictive power from the class $\\mathcal{C}$,\nirrespective of the loss function in $\\mathcal{L}$.\nWe show that such \"loss-oblivious'' learning is feasible through a connection\nto multicalibration, a notion introduced in the context of algorithmic\nfairness. In addition, we show how multicalibration can be viewed as a solution\nconcept for agnostic boosting, shedding new light on past results.

Recent work has made promising\nprogress on this task by pre-trained language models and a multi-submodule\nframework.

Although some work\nhas utilized auxiliary tasks to help handle zero-shot tables, expensive extra\nmanual annotation limits their practicality. In this paper, we propose a new\napproach for the zero-shot text-to-SQL task which does not rely on any\nadditional manual annotations. Our approach consists of two parts. First, we\npropose a new model that leverages the abundant information of table content to\nhelp establish the mapping between questions and zero-shot tables. Further, we\npropose a simple but efficient meta-learning strategy to train our model. The\nstrategy utilizes the two-step gradient update to force the model to learn a\ngeneralization ability towards zero-shot tables. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on a public open-domain text-to-SQL dataset WikiSQL and a\ndomain-specific dataset ESQL. Compared to existing approaches using the same\npre-trained model, our approach achieves significant improvements on both\ndatasets. Compared to the larger pre-trained model and the tabular-specific\npre-trained model, our approach is still competitive.

    "abstract": "We consider a facility location game in which $n$ agents reside at known\nlocations on a path, and $k$ heterogeneous facilities are to be constructed on\nthe path. Each agent is adversely affected by some subset of the facilities,\nand is unaffected by the others. We design two classes of mechanisms for\nchoosing the facility locations given the reported agent preferences:\nutilitarian mechanisms that strive to maximize social welfare (i.e., to be\nefficient), and egalitarian mechanisms that strive to maximize the minimum\nwelfare. For the utilitarian objective, we present a weakly group-strategyproof\nefficient mechanism for up to three facilities, we give a strongly\ngroup-strategyproof mechanism that guarantees at least half of the optimal\nsocial welfare for arbitrary $k$, and we prove that no strongly\ngroup-strategyproof mechanism achieves an approximation ratio of $5/4$ for one\nfacility. For the egalitarian objective, we present a strategyproof egalitarian\nmechanism for arbitrary $k$, and we prove that no weakly group-strategyproof\nmechanism achieves a $o(\\sqrt{n})$ approximation ratio for two facilities. We\nextend our egalitarian results to the case where the agents are located on a\ncycle, and we extend our first egalitarian result to the case where the agents\nare located in the unit square.",

    "title": "Guiding Topic Flows in the Generative Chatbot by Enhancing the  ConceptNet with the Conversation Corpora",
    "abstract": "Human conversations consist of reasonable and natural topic flows, which are\nobserved as the shifts of the mentioned concepts across utterances. Previous\nchatbots that incorporate the external commonsense knowledge graph prove that\nmodeling the concept shifts can effectively alleviate the dull and\nuninformative response dilemma. However, there still exists a gap between the\nconcept relations in the natural conversation and those in the external\ncommonsense knowledge graph, which is an issue to solve. Specifically, the\nconcept relations in the external commonsense knowledge graph are not\nintuitively built from the conversational scenario but the world knowledge,\nwhich makes them insufficient for the chatbot construction. To bridge the above\ngap, we propose the method to supply more concept relations extracted from the\nconversational corpora and reconstruct an enhanced concept graph for the\nchatbot construction. In addition, we present a novel, powerful, and fast graph\nencoding architecture named the Edge-Transformer to replace the traditional GNN\narchitecture. Experimental results on the Reddit conversation dataset indicate\nour proposed method significantly outperforms strong baseline systems and\nachieves new SOTA results. Further analysis individually proves the\neffectiveness of the enhanced concept graph and the Edge-Transformer\narchitecture.",

    "abstract": "We study the matrix completion problem that leverages hierarchical similarity\ngraphs as side information in the context of recommender systems. Under a\nhierarchical stochastic block model that well respects practically-relevant\nsocial graphs and a low-rank rating matrix model, we characterize the exact\ninformation-theoretic limit on the number of observed matrix entries (i.e.,\noptimal sample complexity) by proving sharp upper and lower bounds on the\nsample complexity. In the achievability proof, we demonstrate that probability\nof error of the maximum likelihood estimator vanishes for sufficiently large\nnumber of users and items, if all sufficient conditions are satisfied. On the\nother hand, the converse (impossibility) proof is based on the genie-aided\nmaximum likelihood estimator. Under each necessary condition, we present\nexamples of a genie-aided estimator to prove that the probability of error does\nnot vanish for sufficiently large number of users and items. One important\nconsequence of this result is that exploiting the hierarchical structure of\nsocial graphs yields a substantial gain in sample complexity relative to the\none that simply identifies different groups without resorting to the relational\nstructure across them. More specifically, we analyze the optimal sample\ncomplexity and identify different regimes whose characteristics rely on quality\nmetrics of side information of the hierarchical similarity graph. Finally, we\npresent simulation results to corroborate our theoretical findings and show\nthat the characterized information-theoretic limit can be asymptotically\nachieved.",

    "abstract": "Stencil computation is an important class of scientific applications that can\nbe efficiently executed by graphics processing units (GPUs). Out-of-core\napproach helps run large scale stencil codes that process data with sizes\nlarger than the limited capacity of GPU memory. However, the performance of the\nGPU-based out-of-core stencil computation is always limited by the data\ntransfer between the CPU and GPU. Many optimizations have been explored to\nreduce such data transfer, but the study on the use of on-the-fly compression\ntechniques is far from sufficient. In this study, we propose a method that\naccelerates the GPU-based out-of-core stencil computation with on-the-fly\ncompression. We introduce a novel data compression approach that solves the\ndata dependency between two contiguous decomposed data blocks. We also modify a\nwidely used GPU-based compression library to support pipelining that overlaps\nCPU/GPU data transfer with GPU computation. Experimental results show that the\nproposed method achieved a speedup of 1.2x compared the method without\ncompression. Moreover, although the precision loss involved by compression\nincreased with the number of time steps, the precision loss was trivial up to\n4,320 time steps, demonstrating the usefulness of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "Learning communication via deep reinforcement learning (RL) or imitation\nlearning (IL) has recently been shown to be an effective way to solve\nMulti-Agent Path Finding (MAPF). However, existing communication based MAPF\nsolvers focus on broadcast communication, where an agent broadcasts its message\nto all other or predefined agents. It is not only impractical but also leads to\nredundant information that could even impair the multi-agent cooperation. A\nsuccinct communication scheme should learn which information is relevant and\ninfluential to each agent's decision making process. To address this problem,\nwe consider a request-reply scenario and propose Decision Causal Communication\n(DCC), a simple yet efficient model to enable agents to select neighbors to\nconduct communication during both training and execution. Specifically, a\nneighbor is determined as relevant and influential only when the presence of\nthis neighbor causes the decision adjustment on the central agent. This\njudgment is learned only based on agent's local observation and thus suitable\nfor decentralized execution to handle large scale problems.

    "abstract": "Deep neural network based methods have been successfully applied to music\nsource separation. They typically learn a mapping from a mixture spectrogram to\na set of source spectrograms, all with magnitudes only. This approach has\nseveral limitations: 1) its incorrect phase reconstruction degrades the\nperformance, 2) it limits the magnitude of masks between 0 and 1 while we\nobserve that 22% of time-frequency bins have ideal ratio mask values of over~1\nin a popular dataset, MUSDB18, 3) its potential on very deep architectures is\nunder-explored. Our proposed system is designed to overcome these. First, we\npropose to estimate phases by estimating complex ideal ratio masks (cIRMs)\nwhere we decouple the estimation of cIRMs into magnitude and phase estimations.\nSecond, we extend the separation method to effectively allow the magnitude of\nthe mask to be larger than 1. Finally, we propose a residual UNet architecture\nwith up to 143 layers.

In this work, we\nexplore whether the core self-attention module in Transformer is the key to\nachieving excellent performance in image recognition. To this end, we build an\nattention-free network called sMLPNet based on the existing MLP-based vision\nmodels. Specifically, we replace the MLP module in the token-mixing step with a\nnovel sparse MLP (sMLP) module. For 2D image tokens, sMLP applies 1D MLP along\nthe axial directions and the parameters are shared among rows or columns. By\nsparse connection and weight sharing, sMLP module significantly reduces the\nnumber of model parameters and computational complexity, avoiding the common\nover-fitting problem that plagues the performance of MLP-like models. When only\ntrained on the ImageNet-1K dataset, the proposed sMLPNet achieves 81.9% top-1\naccuracy with only 24M parameters, which is much better than most CNNs and\nvision Transformers under the same model size constraint. When scaling up to\n66M parameters, sMLPNet achieves 83.4% top-1 accuracy, which is on par with the\nstate-of-the-art Swin Transformer.

    "abstract": "Many recent successes in sentence representation learning have been achieved\nby simply fine-tuning on the Natural Language Inference (NLI) datasets with\ntriplet loss or siamese loss. Nevertheless, they share a common weakness:\nsentences in a contradiction pair are not necessarily from different semantic\ncategories. Therefore, optimizing the semantic entailment and contradiction\nreasoning objective alone is inadequate to capture the high-level semantic\nstructure. The drawback is compounded by the fact that the vanilla siamese or\ntriplet losses only learn from individual sentence pairs or triplets, which\noften suffer from bad local optima.

The\nless time EMVs spend traveling through the traffic, the more likely it would\nhelp save people's lives and reduce property loss. To reduce the travel time of\nEMVs, prior work has used route optimization based on historical traffic-flow\ndata and traffic signal pre-emption based on the optimal route. However,\ntraffic signal pre-emption dynamically changes the traffic flow which, in turn,\nmodifies the optimal route of an EMV. In addition, traffic signal pre-emption\npractices usually lead to significant disturbances in traffic flow and\nsubsequently increase the travel time for non-EMVs. In this paper, we propose\nEMVLight, a decentralized reinforcement learning (RL) framework for\nsimultaneous dynamic routing and traffic signal control. EMVLight extends\nDijkstra's algorithm to efficiently update the optimal route for the EMVs in\nreal time as it travels through the traffic network. The decentralized RL\nagents learn network-level cooperative traffic signal phase strategies that not\nonly reduce EMV travel time but also reduce the average travel time of non-EMVs\nin the network.

    "abstract": "Internet search affects people's cognition of the world, so mitigating biases\nin search results and learning fair models is imperative for social good. We\nstudy a unique gender bias in image search in this work: the search images are\noften gender-imbalanced for gender-neutral natural language queries. We\ndiagnose two typical image search models, the specialized model trained on\nin-domain datasets and the generalized representation model pre-trained on\nmassive image and text data across the internet. Both models suffer from severe\ngender bias. Therefore, we introduce two novel debiasing approaches: an\nin-processing fair sampling method to address the gender imbalance issue for\ntraining models, and a post-processing feature clipping method base on mutual\ninformation to debias multimodal representations of pre-trained models.\nExtensive experiments on MS-COCO and Flickr30K benchmarks show that our methods\nsignificantly reduce the gender bias in image search models.",

    "abstract": "Resistive random-access memory (ReRAM) is a promising technology for\ndesigning hardware accelerators for deep neural network (DNN) inferencing.\nHowever, stochastic noise in ReRAM crossbars can degrade the DNN inferencing\naccuracy. We propose the design and optimization of a high-performance,\narea-and energy-efficient ReRAM-based hardware accelerator to achieve robust\nDNN inferencing in the presence of stochastic noise. We make two key technical\ncontributions. First, we propose a stochastic-noise-aware training method,\nreferred to as ReSNA, to improve the accuracy of DNN inferencing on ReRAM\ncrossbars with stochastic noise. Second, we propose an information-theoretic\nalgorithm, referred to as CF-MESMO, to identify the Pareto set of solutions to\ntrade-off multiple objectives, including inferencing accuracy, area overhead,\nexecution time, and energy consumption. The main challenge in this context is\nthat executing the ReSNA method to evaluate each candidate ReRAM design is\nprohibitive. To address this challenge, we utilize the continuous-fidelity\nevaluation of ReRAM designs associated with prohibitive high computation cost\nby varying the number of training epochs to trade-off accuracy and cost.\nCF-MESMO iteratively selects the candidate ReRAM design and fidelity pair that\nmaximizes the information gained per unit computation cost about the optimal\nPareto front. Our experiments on benchmark DNNs show that the proposed\nalgorithms efficiently uncover high-quality Pareto fronts. On average, ReSNA\nachieves 2.57% inferencing accuracy improvement for ResNet20 on the CIFAR-10\ndataset with respect to the baseline configuration. Moreover, CF-MESMO\nalgorithm achieves 90.91% reduction in computation cost compared to the popular\nmulti-objective optimization algorithm NSGA-II to reach the best solution from\nNSGA-II.",

Although this cooperation shows the competitiveness in the point\ncloud, it inevitably alters and abandons the 3D topology and geometric\nrelations. A natural remedy is to utilize the 3D voxelization and 3D\nconvolution network. However, we found that in the outdoor point cloud, the\nimprovement obtained in this way is quite limited. An important reason is the\nproperty of the outdoor point cloud, namely sparsity and varying density.\nMotivated by this investigation, we propose a new framework for the outdoor\nLiDAR segmentation, where cylindrical partition and asymmetrical 3D convolution\nnetworks are designed to explore the 3D geometric pattern while maintaining\nthese inherent properties. The proposed model acts as a backbone and the\nlearned features from this model can be used for downstream tasks such as point\ncloud semantic and panoptic segmentation or 3D detection. In this paper, we\nbenchmark our model on these three tasks. For semantic segmentation, we\nevaluate the proposed model on several large-scale datasets, \\ie,\nSemanticKITTI, nuScenes and A2D2.

    "abstract": "News recommendation is critical for personalized news access. Most existing\nnews recommendation methods rely on centralized storage of users' historical\nnews click behavior data, which may lead to privacy concerns and hazards.\nFederated Learning is a privacy-preserving framework for multiple clients to\ncollaboratively train models without sharing their private data. However, the\ncomputation and communication cost of directly learning many existing news\nrecommendation models in a federated way are unacceptable for user clients. In\nthis paper, we propose an efficient federated learning framework for\nprivacy-preserving news recommendation. Instead of training and communicating\nthe whole model, we decompose the news recommendation model into a large news\nmodel maintained in the server and a light-weight user model shared on both\nserver and clients, where news representations and user model are communicated\nbetween server and clients. More specifically, the clients request the user\nmodel and news representations from the server, and send their locally computed\ngradients to the server for aggregation. The server updates its global user\nmodel with the aggregated gradients, and further updates its news model to\ninfer updated news representations. Since the local gradients may contain\nprivate information, we propose a secure aggregation method to aggregate\ngradients in a privacy-preserving way. Experiments on two real-world datasets\nshow that our method can reduce the computation and communication cost on\nclients while keep promising model performance.",

The current survey\nproposes a triangular type-2 fuzzy regression (TT2FR) model to ameliorate the\nefficiency of the model by handling the uncertainty in the data. The triangular\nsecondary membership function is used instead of widely used interval type\nmodels. In the proposed model, vagueness in primary and secondary fuzzy sets is\nminimized and also, a specified x-plane of observed value is included in the\nsame {\\alpha}- plane of the predicted value.

Its aim is the design of a (nonlinear) feedback law\nthat brings and maintains the state trajectory of a dynamic system on a given\nsliding surface. Here, dynamics becomes completely independent of the model\nparameters and can be tuned accordingly to the desired target. In this paper we\nstudy this problem when the feedback law is subject to strong structural\nconstraints. In particular, we assume that the control input may take values\nonly over two bounded and disjoint sets. Such sets could be also non perfectly\nknown a priori. An example is a control input allowed to switch only between\ntwo values. Under these peculiarities, we derive the necessary and sufficient\nconditions that guarantee sliding-mode control effectiveness for a class of\ntime-varying continuous-time linear systems that includes all the stationary\nstate-space linear models. Our analysis covers several scientific fields. It is\nonly apparently confined to the linear setting and allows also to study an\nimportant set of nonlinear models. We describe fundamental examples related to\nepidemiology where the control input is the level of contact rate among people\nand the sliding surface permits to control the number of infected. For popular\nepidemiological models we prove the global convergence of control schemes based\non the introduction of severe restrictions, like lockdowns, to contain\nepidemic.

Therefore, we propose a\nnovel mechanism named DRo (for Deep Routing) for data-scarce domains like\nsecurity. The DRo approach builds upon some of the recent developments in\nDeep-Clustering. In particular, it exploits the self-augmented training\nmechanism using synthetically generated local perturbations. DRo not only\nallays the challenges with sparse-labeled data but also offers many unique\nadvantages. We also developed a system named DRoID that uses the DRo mechanism\nfor enhancing the performance of an existing Malware Detection System that uses\n(low information features like the) Android implicit Intent(s) as the only\nfeatures. We conduct experiments on DRoID using a popular and standardized\nAndroid malware dataset and found that the DRo mechanism could successfully\nreduce the false-alarms generated by the downstream classifier by 67.9%, and\nalso simultaneously boosts its accuracy by 11.3%. This is significant not only\nbecause the gains achieved are unparalleled but also because the features used\nwere never considered rich enough to train a classifier on; and hence no decent\nperformance could ever be reported by any malware classification system\ntill-date using these features in isolation. Owing to the results achieved, the\nDRo mechanism claims a dominant position amongst all known systems that aims to\nenhance the classification performance of deep learning models with\nsparse-labeled data.",

    "abstract": "The progress of some AI paradigms such as deep learning is said to be linked\nto an exponential growth in the number of parameters. There are many studies\ncorroborating these trends, but does this translate into an exponential\nincrease in energy consumption? In order to answer this question we focus on\ninference costs rather than training costs, as the former account for most of\nthe computing effort, solely because of the multiplicative factors. Also, apart\nfrom algorithmic innovations, we account for more specific and powerful\nhardware (leading to higher FLOPS) that is usually accompanied with important\nenergy efficiency optimisations. We also move the focus from the first\nimplementation of a breakthrough paper towards the consolidated version of the\ntechniques one or two year later. Under this distinctive and comprehensive\nperspective, we study relevant models in the areas of computer vision and\nnatural language processing: for a sustained increase in performance we see a\nmuch softer growth in energy consumption than previously anticipated.

In\ndiscrete-event systems, based on a standard setting in which an intruder has\nthe complete knowledge of the system's structure, the standard versions of\ncurrent-state opacity and initial-state opacity cannot perfectly characterize\nhigh-level privacy requirements. To overcome such a limitation, in this paper\nwe propose two stronger versions of opacity in partially-observed\ndiscrete-event systems, called \\emph{strong current-state opacity} and\n\\emph{strong initial-state opacity}. Strong current-state opacity describes\nthat an intruder never makes for sure whether a system is in a secret state at\nthe current time, that is, if a system satisfies this property, then for each\nrun of the system ended by a secret state, there exists a non-secret run whose\nobservation is the same as that of the previous run. Strong initial-state\nopacity captures that the visit of a secret state at the initial time cannot be\ninferred by an intruder at any instant. Specifically, a system is said to be\nstrongly initial-state opaque if for each run starting from a secret state,\nthere exists a non-secret run of the system that has the same observation as\nthe previous run has. To verify these two properties, we propose two\ninformation structures using a novel concurrent-composition technique, which\nhas exponential-time complexity\n$O(|X|^4|\\Sigma_o||\\Sigma_{uo}||\\Sigma|2^{|X|})$, where $|X|$ (resp.,\n$|\\Sigma|$, $|\\Sigma_o|$, $|\\Sigma_{uo}|$) is the number of states (resp.,\nevents, observable events, unobservable events) of a system.",

    "abstract": "As the global need for large-scale data storage is rising exponentially,\nexisting storage technologies are approaching their theoretical and functional\nlimits in terms of density and energy consumption, making DNA based storage a\npotential solution for the future of data storage. Several studies introduced\nDNA based storage systems with high information density (petabytes/gram).\nHowever, DNA synthesis and sequencing technologies yield erroneous outputs.\nAlgorithmic approaches for correcting these errors depend on reading multiple\ncopies of each sequence and result in excessive reading costs. The\nunprecedented success of Transformers as a deep learning architecture for\nlanguage modeling has led to its repurposing for solving a variety of tasks\nacross various domains. In this work, we propose a novel approach for\nsingle-read reconstruction using an encoder-decoder Transformer architecture\nfor DNA based data storage. We address the error correction process as a\nself-supervised sequence-to-sequence task and use synthetic noise injection to\ntrain the model using only the decoded reads. Our approach exploits the\ninherent redundancy of each decoded file to learn its underlying structure. To\ndemonstrate our proposed approach, we encode text, image and code-script files\nto DNA, produce errors with high-fidelity error simulator, and reconstruct the\noriginal files from the noisy reads. Our model achieves lower error rates when\nreconstructing the original data from a single read of each DNA strand compared\nto state-of-the-art algorithms using 2-3 copies. This is the first\ndemonstration of using deep learning models for single-read reconstruction in\nDNA based storage which allows for the reduction of the overall cost of the\nprocess.

    "abstract": "Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) caused by prenatal alcohol exposure can result\nin a series of cranio-facial anomalies, and behavioral and neurocognitive\nproblems. Current diagnosis of FAS is typically done by identifying a set of\nfacial characteristics, which are often obtained by manual examination.\nAnatomical landmark detection, which provides rich geometric information, is\nimportant to detect the presence of FAS associated facial anomalies. This\nimaging application is characterized by large variations in data appearance and\nlimited availability of labeled data. Current deep learning-based heatmap\nregression methods designed for facial landmark detection in natural images\nassume availability of large datasets and are therefore not wellsuited for this\napplication. To address this restriction, we develop a new regularized transfer\nlearning approach that exploits the knowledge of a network learned on large\nfacial recognition datasets. In contrast to standard transfer learning which\nfocuses on adjusting the pre-trained weights, the proposed learning approach\nregularizes the model behavior. It explicitly reuses the rich visual semantics\nof a domain-similar source model on the target task data as an additional\nsupervisory signal for regularizing landmark detection optimization.\nSpecifically, we develop four regularization constraints for the proposed\ntransfer learning, including constraining the feature outputs from\nclassification and intermediate layers, as well as matching activation\nattention maps in both spatial and channel levels. Experimental evaluation on a\ncollected clinical imaging dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach can\neffectively improve model generalizability under limited training samples, and\nis advantageous to other approaches in the literature.",

However, most previous\nReinforcement Learning (RL) works only demonstrate the success in controlling\nwith either discrete or continuous action space, while seldom take into account\nthe hybrid action space. One naive way to address hybrid action RL is to\nconvert the hybrid action space into a unified homogeneous action space by\ndiscretization or continualization, so that conventional RL algorithms can be\napplied. However, this ignores the underlying structure of hybrid action space\nand also induces the scalability issue and additional approximation\ndifficulties, thus leading to degenerated results. In this paper, we propose\nHybrid Action Representation (HyAR) to learn a compact and decodable latent\nrepresentation space for the original hybrid action space. HyAR constructs the\nlatent space and embeds the dependence between discrete action and continuous\nparameter via an embedding table and conditional Variantional Auto-Encoder\n(VAE). To further improve the effectiveness, the action representation is\ntrained to be semantically smooth through unsupervised environmental dynamics\nprediction. Finally, the agent then learns its policy with conventional DRL\nalgorithms in the learned representation space and interacts with the\nenvironment by decoding the hybrid action embeddings to the original action\nspace.

This task is challenging because of many essential factors,\nsuch as cooperation among neighboring intersections and dynamic traffic\nscenarios. First, to facilitate cooperation of traffic signals, existing work\nadopts graph neural networks to incorporate the temporal and spatial influences\nof the surrounding intersections into the target intersection, where\nspatial-temporal information is used separately. However, one drawback of these\nmethods is that the spatial-temporal correlations are not adequately exploited\nto obtain a better control scheme. Second, in a dynamic traffic environment,\nthe historical state of the intersection is also critical for predicting future\nsignal switching. Previous work mainly solves this problem using the current\nintersection's state, neglecting the fact that traffic flow is continuously\nchanging both spatially and temporally and does not handle the historical\nstate.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel neural network framework named DynSTGAT,\nwhich integrates dynamic historical state into a new spatial-temporal graph\nattention network to address the above two problems. More specifically, our\nDynSTGAT model employs a novel multi-head graph attention mechanism, which aims\nto adequately exploit the joint relations of spatial-temporal information.\nThen, to efficiently utilize the historical state information of the\nintersection, we design a sequence model with the temporal convolutional\nnetwork (TCN) to capture the historical information and further merge it with\nthe spatial information to improve its performance.

    "title": "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Schemes for Building ASR in Low-resource  Languages",
    "abstract": "Building an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system from scratch requires a\nlarge amount of annotated speech data, which is difficult to collect in many\nlanguages. However, there are cases where the low-resource language shares a\ncommon acoustic space with a high-resource language having enough annotated\ndata to build an ASR. In such cases, we show that the domain-independent\nacoustic models learned from the high-resource language through unsupervised\ndomain adaptation (UDA) schemes can enhance the performance of the ASR in the\nlow-resource language. We use the specific example of Hindi in the source\ndomain and Sanskrit in the target domain. We explore two architectures: i)\ndomain adversarial training using gradient reversal layer (GRL) and ii) domain\nseparation networks (DSN). The GRL and DSN architectures give absolute\nimprovements of 6.71% and 7.32%, respectively, in word error rate over the\nbaseline deep neural network model when trained on just 5.5 hours of data in\nthe target domain. We also show that choosing a proper language (Telugu) in the\nsource domain can bring further improvement. The results suggest that UDA\nschemes can be helpful in the development of ASR systems for low-resource\nlanguages, mitigating the hassle of collecting large amounts of annotated\nspeech data.",

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been utilized in various applications\nranging from image classification and facial recognition to medical imagery\nanalysis and real-time object detection. As our models become more\nsophisticated and complex, the computational cost of training such models\nbecomes a burden for small companies and individuals; for this reason,\noutsourcing the training process has been the go-to option for such users.\nUnfortunately, outsourcing the training process comes at the cost of\nvulnerability to backdoor attacks. These attacks aim at establishing hidden\nbackdoors in the DNN such that the model performs well on benign samples but\noutputs a particular target label when a trigger is applied to the input.\nCurrent backdoor attacks rely on generating triggers in the image/pixel domain;\nhowever, as we show in this paper, it is not the only domain to exploit and one\nshould always \"check the other doors\". In this work, we propose a complete\npipeline for generating a dynamic, efficient, and invisible backdoor attack in\nthe frequency domain. We show the advantages of utilizing the frequency domain\nfor establishing undetectable and powerful backdoor attacks through extensive\nexperiments on various datasets and network architectures. The backdoored\nmodels are shown to break various state-of-the-art defences. We also show two\npossible defences that succeed against frequency-based backdoor attacks and\npossible ways for the attacker to bypass them. We conclude the work with some\nremarks regarding a network's learning capacity and the capability of embedding\na backdoor attack in the model.",

Several attempts have been made to improve the\nbias-variance trade-off using auxiliary information. In particular, document\nmodeling-based methods have improved the model's accuracy by using textual data\nsuch as reviews, abstracts, and storylines when the user-to-item rating matrix\nis sparse. However, such models are insufficient to learn optimal\nrepresentation for users and items. User-based and item-based collaborative\nfiltering, owing to their efficiency and interpretability, have been long used\nfor building recommender systems.

Another\nadvantage of our model is that it supports online personalization.

In practice, multi-grained semantic labels are automatically\nconstructed for a query image in both sentence-level and phrase-level.

Intuitively, the\ninformation contained in visual data can be divided into person information\n(PI) and surroundings information (SI), which are mutually exclusive from each\nother. To this end, we propose a novel Deep Surroundings-person Separation\nLearning (DSSL) model in this paper to effectively extract and match person\ninformation, and hence achieve a superior retrieval accuracy. A\nsurroundings-person separation and fusion mechanism plays the key role to\nrealize an accurate and effective surroundings-person separation under a\nmutually exclusion constraint. In order to adequately utilize multi-modal and\nmulti-granular information for a higher retrieval accuracy, five diverse\nalignment paradigms are adopted. Extensive experiments are carried out to\nevaluate the proposed DSSL on CUHK-PEDES, which is currently the only\naccessible dataset for text-base person retrieval task. DSSL achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance on CUHK-PEDES.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, called\nencoding distributional soft actor-critic (E-DSAC), for decision-making in\nautonomous driving. Unlike existing RL-based decision-making methods, E-DSAC is\nsuitable for situations where the number of surrounding vehicles is variable\nand eliminates the requirement for manually pre-designed sorting rules,\nresulting in higher policy performance and generality. We first develop an\nencoding distributional policy iteration (DPI) framework by embedding a\npermutation invariant module, which employs a feature neural network (NN) to\nencode the indicators of each vehicle, in the distributional RL framework. The\nproposed DPI framework is proved to exhibit important properties in terms of\nconvergence and global optimality. Next, based on the developed encoding DPI\nframework, we propose the E-DSAC algorithm by adding the gradient-based update\nrule of the feature NN to the policy evaluation process of the DSAC algorithm.\nThen, the multi-lane driving task and the corresponding reward function are\ndesigned to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Results show\nthat the policy learned by E-DSAC can realize efficient, smooth, and relatively\nsafe autonomous driving in the designed scenario. And the final policy\nperformance learned by E-DSAC is about three times that of DSAC. Furthermore,\nits effectiveness has also been verified in real vehicle experiments.",

    "title": "Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Learning via Synthetic Data for Person  Re-identification",
    "abstract": "Person re-identification (re-ID) has gained more and more attention due to\nits widespread applications in intelligent video surveillance. Unfortunately,\nthe mainstream deep learning methods still need a large quantity of labeled\ndata to train models, and annotating data is an expensive work in real-world\nscenarios. In addition, due to domain gaps between different datasets, the\nperformance is dramatically decreased when re-ID models pre-trained on\nlabel-rich datasets (source domain) are directly applied to other unlabeled\ndatasets (target domain). In this paper, we attempt to remedy these problems\nfrom two aspects, namely data and methodology. Firstly, we develop a data\ncollector to automatically generate synthetic re-ID samples in a computer game,\nand construct a data labeler to simultaneously annotate them, which free humans\nfrom heavy data collections and annotations. Based on them, we build two\nsynthetic person re-ID datasets with different scales, \"GSPR\" and \"mini-GSPR\"\ndatasets. Secondly, we propose a synthesis-based multi-domain collaborative\nrefinement (SMCR) network, which contains a synthetic pretraining module and\ntwo collaborative-refinement modules to implement sufficient learning for the\nvaluable knowledge from multiple domains. Extensive experiments show that our\nproposed framework obtains significant performance improvements over the\nstate-of-the-art methods on multiple unsupervised domain adaptation tasks of\nperson re-ID.",

Prior literature has proposed various methods (e.g., MSP (Hendrycks &\nGimpel, 2017), ODIN (Liang et al., 2018), Mahalanobis (Lee et al., 2018)),\nclaiming they are state-of-the-art by showing they outperform previous methods\non a selected set of in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD)\ndatasets. In this work, we show that none of these methods are inherently\nbetter at OOD detection than others on a standardized set of 16 (ID, OOD)\npairs. We give possible explanations for these inconsistencies with simple toy\ndatasets where whether one method outperforms another depends on the structure\nof the ID and OOD datasets in question. Finally, we show that a method\noutperforming another on a certain (ID, OOD) pair may not do so in a low-data\nregime. In the low-data regime, we propose a distance-based method, Pairwise\nOOD detection (POD), which is based on Siamese networks and improves over\nMahalanobis by sidestepping the expensive covariance estimation step.

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks exhibit remarkable performance in graph data analysis.\nHowever, the robustness of GNN models remains a challenge. As a result, they\nare not reliable enough to be deployed in critical applications. Recent studies\ndemonstrate that GNNs could be easily fooled with adversarial perturbations,\nespecially structural perturbations. Such vulnerability is attributed to the\nexcessive dependence on the structure information to make predictions. To\nachieve better robustness, it is desirable to build the prediction of GNNs with\nmore comprehensive features. Graph data, in most cases, has two views of\ninformation, namely structure information and feature information. In this\npaper, we propose CoG, a simple yet effective co-training framework to combine\nthese two views for the purpose of robustness. CoG trains sub-models from the\nfeature view and the structure view independently and allows them to distill\nknowledge from each other by adding their most confident unlabeled data into\nthe training set. The orthogonality of these two views diversifies the\nsub-models, thus enhancing the robustness of their ensemble. We evaluate our\nframework on three popular datasets, and results show that CoG significantly\nimproves the robustness of graph models against adversarial attacks without\nsacrificing their performance on clean data. We also show that CoG still\nachieves good robustness when both node features and graph structures are\nperturbed.",

To this end, hyperspherical face recognition, as a promising line\nof research, has attracted increasing attention and gradually become a major\nfocus in face recognition research. As one of the earliest works in\nhyperspherical face recognition, SphereFace explicitly proposed to learn face\nembeddings with large inter-class angular margin.

In order to address this problem, we introduce a unified framework to\nunderstand large angular margin in hyperspherical face recognition. Under this\nframework, we extend the study of SphereFace and propose an improved variant\nwith substantially better training stability -- SphereFace-R. Specifically, we\npropose two novel ways to implement the multiplicative margin, and study\nSphereFace-R under three different feature normalization schemes (no feature\nnormalization, hard feature normalization and soft feature normalization).

    "abstract": "3D scene understanding from point clouds plays a vital role for various\nrobotic applications. Unfortunately, current state-of-the-art methods use\nseparate neural networks for different tasks like object detection or room\nlayout estimation. Such a scheme has two limitations: 1) Storing and running\nseveral networks for different tasks are expensive for typical robotic\nplatforms. 2) The intrinsic structure of separate outputs are ignored and\npotentially violated. To this end, we propose the first transformer\narchitecture that predicts 3D objects and layouts simultaneously, using point\ncloud inputs. Unlike existing methods that either estimate layout keypoints or\nedges, we directly parameterize room layout as a set of quads. As such, the\nproposed architecture is termed as P(oint)Q(uad)-Transformer. Along with the\nnovel quad representation, we propose a tailored physical constraint loss\nfunction that discourages object-layout interference. The quantitative and\nqualitative evaluations on the public benchmark ScanNet show that the proposed\nPQ-Transformer succeeds to jointly parse 3D objects and layouts, running at a\nquasi-real-time (8.91 FPS) rate without efficiency-oriented optimization.\nMoreover, the new physical constraint loss can improve strong baselines, and\nthe F1-score of the room layout is significantly promoted from 37.9% to 57.9%.",

In classification tasks with a small number of\nclasses or binary detection (two classes) the amount of information transferred\nfrom the teacher to the student network is restricted, thus limiting the\nutility of knowledge distillation. Performance can be improved by leveraging\ninformation about possible subclasses within the available classes in the\nclassification task. To that end, we propose the so-called Subclass Knowledge\nDistillation (SKD) framework, which is the process of transferring the\nsubclasses' prediction knowledge from a large teacher model into a smaller\nstudent one. Through SKD, additional meaningful information which is not in the\nteacher's class logits but exists in subclasses (e.g., similarities inside\nclasses) will be conveyed to the student and boost its performance.\nMathematically, we measure how many extra information bits the teacher can\nprovide for the student via SKD framework. The framework developed is evaluated\nin clinical application, namely colorectal polyp binary classification. In this\napplication, clinician-provided annotations are used to define subclasses based\non the annotation label's variability in a curriculum style of learning. A\nlightweight, low complexity student trained with the proposed framework\nachieves an F1-score of 85.05%, an improvement of 2.14% and 1.49% gain over the\nstudent that trains without and with conventional knowledge distillation,\nrespectively. These results show that the extra subclasses' knowledge (i.e.,\n0.4656 label bits per training sample in our experiment) can provide more\ninformation about the teacher generalization, and therefore SKD can benefit\nfrom using more information to increase the student performance.",

To the best of our\nknowledge, MDIF is the first deep implicit function model that can at the same\ntime (1) represent different levels of detail and allow progressive decoding;\n(2) support both encoder-decoder inference and decoder-only latent\noptimization, and fulfill multiple applications; (3) perform detailed\ndecoder-only shape completion. Experiments demonstrate its superior performance\nagainst prior art in various 3D reconstruction tasks.",

    "abstract": "In this work we propose a solution to the UbiComp 2021 Challenge by Stabilo\nin which handwritten mathematical terms are supposed to be automatically\nclassified based on time series sensor data captured on the DigiPen. The input\ndata set contains data of different writers, with label strings constructed\nfrom a total of 15 different possible characters. The label should first be\nsplit into separate characters to classify them one by one. This issue is\nsolved by applying a data-dependant and rule-based information extraction\nalgorithm to the labeled data. Using the resulting data, two classifiers are\nconstructed. The first is a binary classifier that is able to predict, for\nunknown data, if a sample is part of a writing activity, and consists of a Deep\nNeural Network feature extractor in concatenation with a Random Forest that is\ntrained to classify the extracted features at an F1 score of >90%. The second\nclassifier is a Deep Neural Network that combines convolution layers with\nrecurrent layers to predict windows with a single label, out of the 15 possible\nclasses, at an F1 score of >60%. A simulation of the challenge evaluation\nprocedure reports a Levensthein Distance of 8 and shows that the chosen\napproach still lacks in overall accuracy and real-time applicability.",

Most existing federated learning approaches\nfocus on the supervised setting, which means all the data stored in each client\nhas labels. However, in real-world applications, the client data are impossible\nto be fully labeled. Thus, how to exploit the unlabeled data should be a new\nchallenge for federated learning. Although a few studies are attempting to\novercome this challenge, they may suffer from information leakage or misleading\ninformation usage problems. To tackle these issues, in this paper, we propose a\nnovel federated semi-supervised learning method named FedTriNet, which consists\nof two learning phases. In the first phase, we pre-train FedTriNet using\nlabeled data with FedAvg. In the second phase, we aim to make most of the\nunlabeled data to help model learning. In particular, we propose to use three\nnetworks and a dynamic quality control mechanism to generate high-quality\npseudo labels for unlabeled data, which are added to the training set. Finally,\nFedTriNet uses the new training set to retrain the model. Experimental results\non three publicly available datasets show that the proposed FedTriNet\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines under both IID and Non-IID settings.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a popular technique to train machine learning (ML)\nmodels with decentralized data. Extensive works have studied the performance of\nthe global model; however, it is still unclear how the training process affects\nthe final test accuracy. Exacerbating this problem is the fact that FL\nexecutions differ significantly from traditional ML with heterogeneous data\ncharacteristics across clients, involving more hyperparameters. In this work,\nwe show that the final test accuracy of FL is dramatically affected by the\nearly phase of the training process, i.e., FL exhibits critical learning\nperiods, in which small gradient errors can have irrecoverable impact on the\nfinal test accuracy. To further explain this phenomenon, we generalize the\ntrace of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to FL and define a new notion\ncalled FedFIM, a quantity reflecting the local curvature of each clients from\nthe beginning of the training in FL. Our findings suggest that the {\\em initial\nlearning phase} plays a critical role in understanding the FL performance. This\nis in contrast to many existing works which generally do not connect the final\naccuracy of FL to the early phase training. Finally, seizing critical learning\nperiods in FL is of independent interest and could be useful for other problems\nsuch as the choices of hyperparameters such as the number of client selected\nper round, batch size, and more, so as to improve the performance of FL\ntraining and testing.",

Therefore, balancing the architecture\nof the cGANs is almost impossible.

Under dynamic channel conditions with moving transmitter and/or\nreceiver, the number of MPCs reflected from visible geometric features, the MPC\ndispersion parameters (delay, angle, Doppler frequency, etc), and the number of\nfalse alarm contributions are unknown and time-varying. We develop a Bayesian\nmodel for sequential detection and estimation of MPC dispersion parameters, and\nrepresent it by a factor graph enabling the use of BP for efficient computation\nof the marginal posterior distributions. At each time instance, a\nsnapshot-based channel estimator provides parameter estimates of a set of MPCs\nwhich are used as noisy measurements by the proposed BP-based algorithm. It\nperforms joint probabilistic data association, estimation of the time-varying\nMPC parameters, and the mean number of false alarm measurements by means of the\nsum-product algorithm rules. The results using synthetic measurements show that\nthe proposed algorithm is able to cope with a high number of false alarm\nmeasurements originating from the snapshot-based channel estimator and to\nsequentially detect and estimate MPCs parameters with very low signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR). The performance of the proposed algorithm compares well to\nexisting algorithms for high SNR MPCs, but significantly it outperforms them\nfor medium or low SNR MPCs.

    "abstract": "Garments are ubiquitous in both real and many of the virtual worlds. They are\nhighly deformable objects, exhibit an immense variety of designs and shapes,\nand yet, most garments are created from a set of regularly shaped flat pieces.\nExploration of garment structure presents a peculiar case for an object\nstructure estimation task and might prove useful for downstream tasks of neural\n3D garment modeling and reconstruction by providing strong prior on garment\nshapes. To facilitate research in these directions, we propose a method for\ngenerating large synthetic datasets of 3D garment designs and their sewing\npatterns. Our method consists of a flexible description structure for\nspecifying parametric sewing pattern templates and the automatic generation\npipeline to produce garment 3D models with little-to-none manual intervention.\nTo add realism, the pipeline additionally creates corrupted versions of the\nfinal meshes that imitate artifacts of 3D scanning.\nWith this pipeline, we created the first large-scale synthetic dataset of 3D\ngarment models with their sewing patterns. The dataset contains more than 20000\ngarment design variations produced from 19 different base types. Seven of these\ngarment types are specifically designed to target evaluation of the\ngeneralization across garment sewing pattern topologies.",

We show that adding\nto the optimization goal the expectation loss, which is a better approximation\nof the zero-one loss, helps the network to achieve better accuracy. We,\ntherefore, propose to shift between the two losses during training, focusing\nmore on the expectation loss gradually during the later stages of training.

The considerable amount of data\ngenerated by the IoT devices needs latency-sensitive processing, which is not\nfeasible by deploying the respective applications in remote Cloud datacentres.\nEdge/Fog computing, a promising extension of Cloud at the IoT-proximate\nnetwork, can meet such requirements for smart CPSs. However, the structural and\noperational differences of Edge/Fog infrastructure resist employing Cloud-based\nservice regulations directly to these environments. As a result, many research\nworks have been recently conducted, focusing on efficient application and\nresource management in Edge/Fog computing environments. Scalable Edge/Fog\ninfrastructure is a must to validate these policies, which is also challenging\nto accommodate in the real-world due to high cost and implementation time.\nConsidering simulation as a key to this constraint, various software has been\ndeveloped that can imitate the physical behaviour of Edge/Fog computing\nenvironments. Nevertheless, the existing simulators often fail to support\nadvanced service management features because of their monolithic architecture,\nlack of actual dataset, and limited scope for a periodic update. To overcome\nthese issues, we have developed multiple simulation models for service\nmigration, dynamic distributed cluster formation, and microservice\norchestration for Edge/Fog computing in this work and integrated with the\nexisting iFogSim simulation toolkit for launching it as iFogSim2. The\nperformance of iFogSim2 and its built-in policies are evaluated using three use\ncase scenarios and compared with the contemporary simulators and benchmark\npolicies under different settings. Results indicate that the proposed solution\noutperform others in service management time, network usage, ram consumption,\nand simulation time.",

Different from traditional finite\ndifference operator approach, which may not work for flux type of boundary\nconditions, carefully designed undetermined coefficient methods are utilized in\ndeveloping high order compact (HOC) schemes. The new methods not only can be\nutilized to design HOC schemes for flux type of boundary conditions but can\nalso be applied to general elliptic PDEs including Poisson, Helmholtz,\ndiffusion-advection, and anisotropic equations with linear boundary conditions.\nIn the new developed HOC methods, the coefficient matrices are generally\nM-matrices, which guarantee the discrete maximum principle for well-posed\nproblems, so the convergence of the HOC methods. The developed HOC methods are\nversatile and can cover most of high order compact schemes in the literature.\nThe HOC methods for Robin boundary conditions and for anisotropic diffusion and\nadvection equations with Robin or even Dirichlet boundary conditions are likely\nthe first ones that have ever been developed. With the help of pseudo-inverse,\nor SVD solutions, we have also observed that the developed HOC methods usually\nhave smaller error constants compared with traditional HOC methods when\napplicable.

It is not uncommon that the\nobjective functions are as a black box, the evaluation of which usually involve\ntime-consuming and/or costly physical experiments. Data-driven evolutionary\noptimization can be used to search for a set of non-dominated trade-off\nsolutions, where the expensive objective functions are approximated as a\nsurrogate model. In this paper, we propose a framework for implementing batched\ndata-driven evolutionary multi-objective optimization.

Experiments on 136 benchmark\ntest problem instances with irregular Pareto-optimal front shapes against six\nstate-of-the-art surrogate-assisted EMO algorithms fully demonstrate the\neffectiveness and superiority of our proposed framework.

However, the\nmeasurement process -- where social, cultural, and political values are\nimplicitly encoded in sociotechnical systems -- is almost always obscured.\nFurthermore, this obscured process is where important governance decisions are\nencoded: governance about which systems are fair, which individuals belong in\nwhich categories, and so on. We can then use the language of measurement, and\nthe tools of construct validity and reliability, to uncover hidden governance\ndecisions. In particular, we highlight two types of construct validity, content\nvalidity and consequential validity, that are useful to elicit and characterize\nthe feedback loops between the measurement, social construction, and\nenforcement of social categories. We then explore the constructs of fairness,\nrobustness, and responsibility in the context of governance in and for\nresponsible AI.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising privacy-aware paradigm\nthat allows multiple clients to jointly train a model without sharing their\nprivate data. Recently, many studies have shown that FL is vulnerable to\nmembership inference attacks (MIAs) that can distinguish the training members\nof the given model from the non-members. However, existing MIAs ignore the\nsource of a training member, i.e., the information of which client owns the\ntraining member, while it is essential to explore source privacy in FL beyond\nmembership privacy of examples from all clients. The leakage of source\ninformation can lead to severe privacy issues. For example, identification of\nthe hospital contributing to the training of an FL model for COVID-19 pandemic\ncan render the owner of a data record from this hospital more prone to\ndiscrimination if the hospital is in a high risk region. In this paper, we\npropose a new inference attack called source inference attack (SIA), which can\nderive an optimal estimation of the source of a training member. Specifically,\nwe innovatively adopt the Bayesian perspective to demonstrate that an\nhonest-but-curious server can launch an SIA to steal non-trivial source\ninformation of the training members without violating the FL protocol. The\nserver leverages the prediction loss of local models on the training members to\nachieve the attack effectively and non-intrusively. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on one synthetic and five real datasets to evaluate the key factors\nin an SIA, and the results show the efficacy of the proposed source inference\nattack.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) based smart meter data analytics is very promising for\nenergy management and demand-response applications in the advanced metering\ninfrastructure(AMI). A key challenge in developing distributed ML applications\nfor AMI is to preserve user privacy while allowing active end-users\nparticipation. This paper addresses this challenge and proposes a\nprivacy-preserving federated learning framework for ML applications in the AMI.\nWe consider each smart meter as a federated edge device hosting an ML\napplication that exchanges information with a central aggregator or a data\nconcentrator, periodically. Instead of transferring the raw data sensed by the\nsmart meters, the ML model weights are transferred to the aggregator to\npreserve privacy. The aggregator processes these parameters to devise a robust\nML model that can be substituted at each edge device. We also discuss\nstrategies to enhance privacy and improve communication efficiency while\nsharing the ML model parameters, suited for relatively slow network connections\nin the AMI. We demonstrate the proposed framework on a use case federated ML\n(FML) application that improves short-term load forecasting (STLF). We use a\nlong short-term memory(LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) model for STLF. In\nour architecture, we assume that there is an aggregator connected to a group of\nsmart meters. The aggregator uses the learned model gradients received from the\nfederated smart meters to generate an aggregate, robust RNN model which\nimproves the forecasting accuracy for individual and aggregated STLF. Our\nresults indicate that with FML, forecasting accuracy is increased while\npreserving the data privacy of the end-users.",

    "abstract": "We introduce the Universal Manipulation Policy Network (UMPNet) -- a single\nimage-based policy network that infers closed-loop action sequences for\nmanipulating arbitrary articulated objects. To infer a wide range of action\ntrajectories, the policy supports 6DoF action representation and varying\ntrajectory length. To handle a diverse set of objects, the policy learns from\nobjects with different articulation structures and generalizes to unseen\nobjects or categories. The policy is trained with self-guided exploration\nwithout any human demonstrations, scripted policy, or pre-defined goal\nconditions. To support effective multi-step interaction, we introduce a novel\nArrow-of-Time action attribute that indicates whether an action will change the\nobject state back to the past or forward into the future. With the\nArrow-of-Time inference at each interaction step, the learned policy is able to\nselect actions that consistently lead towards or away from a given state,\nthereby, enabling both effective state exploration and goal-conditioned\nmanipulation.

    "abstract": "There is an emerging sense that the vulnerability of Image Convolutional\nNeural Networks (CNN), i.e., sensitivity to image corruptions, perturbations,\nand adversarial attacks, is connected with Texture Bias. This relative lack of\nShape Bias is also responsible for poor performance in Domain Generalization\n(DG). The inclusion of a role of shape alleviates these vulnerabilities and\nsome approaches have achieved this by training on negative images, images\nendowed with edge maps, or images with conflicting shape and texture\ninformation. This paper advocates an explicit and complete representation of\nshape using a classical computer vision approach, namely, representing the\nshape content of an image with the shock graph of its contour map. The\nresulting graph and its descriptor is a complete representation of contour\ncontent and is classified using recent Graph Neural Network (GNN) methods. The\nexperimental results on three domain shift datasets, Colored MNIST, PACS, and\nVLCS demonstrate that even without using appearance the shape-based approach\nexceeds classical Image CNN based methods in domain generalization.",

Given a face image that claims to be an individual (e.g., Nicolas Cage),\nFaceGuard extracts a watermark from it and predicts the face image to be fake\nif the extracted watermark does not match well with the individual's ground\ntruth one. A key component of FaceGuard is a new deep-learning-based\nwatermarking method, which is 1) robust to normal image post-processing such as\nJPEG compression, Gaussian blurring, cropping, and resizing, but 2) fragile to\ndeepfake manipulation.

In\nthe literature, several fair algorithms have been proposed which mainly focused\non improving the accuracy of the recommendation system.

This paper considers\na metric that measures the popularity bias as the difference in error on\npopular items and non-popular items.

In addition, the inherent semantic feature of the ``hat\"\nattribute should be consistent, whether it is a baseball cap, beret, or helmet.\nTo fully exploit inter-image relations and aggregate human prior in the model\nlearning process, we construct a Spatial and Semantic Consistency (SSC)\nframework that consists of two complementary regularizations to achieve spatial\nand semantic consistency for each attribute. Specifically, we first propose a\nspatial consistency regularization to focus on reliable and stable\nattribute-related regions.

    "abstract": "A line of work has shown that natural text processing models are vulnerable\nto adversarial examples. Correspondingly, various defense methods are proposed\nto mitigate the threat of textual adversarial examples, e.g. adversarial\ntraining, certified defense, input pre-processing, detection, etc. In this\nwork, we treat the optimization process for synonym substitution based textual\nadversarial attacks as a specific sequence of word replacement, in which each\nword mutually influences other words. We identify that we could destroy such\nmutual interaction and eliminate the adversarial perturbation by randomly\nsubstituting a word with its synonyms. Based on this observation, we propose a\nnovel textual adversarial example detection method, termed Randomized\nSubstitution and Vote (RS&V), which votes the prediction label by accumulating\nthe logits of k samples generated by randomly substituting the words in the\ninput text with synonyms. The proposed RS&V is generally applicable to any\nexisting neural networks without modification on the architecture or extra\ntraining, and it is orthogonal to prior work on making the classification\nnetwork itself more robust. Empirical evaluations on three benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that RS&V could detect the textual adversarial examples more\nsuccessfully than the existing detection methods while maintaining the high\nclassification accuracy on benign samples.",

    "abstract": "We study a federated variant of the best-arm identification problem in\nstochastic multi-armed bandits: a set of clients, each of whom can sample only\na subset of the arms, collaborate via a server to identify the best arm (i.e.,\nthe arm with the highest mean reward) with prescribed confidence. For this\nproblem, we propose Fed-SEL, a simple communication-efficient algorithm that\nbuilds on successive elimination techniques and involves local sampling steps\nat the clients. To study the performance of Fed-SEL, we introduce a notion of\narm-heterogeneity that captures the level of dissimilarity between\ndistributions of arms corresponding to different clients. Interestingly, our\nanalysis reveals the benefits of arm-heterogeneity in reducing both the sample-\nand communication-complexity of Fed-SEL. As a special case of our analysis, we\nshow that for certain heterogeneous problem instances, Fed-SEL outputs the\nbest-arm after just one round of communication. Our findings have the following\nkey implication: unlike federated supervised learning where recent work has\nshown that statistical heterogeneity can lead to poor performance, one can\nprovably reap the benefits of both local computation and heterogeneity for\nfederated best-arm identification. As our final contribution, we develop\nvariants of Fed-SEL, both for federated and peer-to-peer settings, that are\nrobust to the presence of Byzantine clients, and hence suitable for deployment\nin harsh, adversarial environments.",

The existing frameworks usually employ complex\nmodels leading to good accuracy and yet low inference efficiency. In this\npaper, we present a lightweight encoder-decoder architecture, CarNet, for\nefficient and high-quality crack detection. To this end, we first propose that\nthe ideal encoder should present an olive-type distribution about the number of\nconvolutional layers at different stages. Specifically, as the network stages\ndeepen in the encoder, the number of convolutional layers shows a downward\ntrend after the model input is compressed in the initial network stage.\nMeanwhile, in the decoder, we introduce a lightweight up-sampling feature\npyramid module to learn rich hierarchical features for crack detection. In\nparticular, we compress the feature maps of the last three network stages to\nthe same channels and then employ up-sampling with different multiples to\nresize them to the same resolutions for information fusion. Finally, extensive\nexperiments on four public databases, i.e., Sun520, Rain365, BJN260, and\nCrack360, demonstrate that our CarNet gains a good trade-off between inference\nefficiency and test accuracy over the existing state-of-the-art methods.",

There are few mobile robots that are capable of handling\nsuch a challenge, and bipedal robots provide a solution.

This paper\npresents an end-to-end vision-aided autonomous navigation framework which\nleverages three layers of planners and a variable walking height controller to\nenable bipedal robots to safely explore height-constrained environments. A\nvertically actuated Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum (vSLIP) model is introduced\nto capture the robot coupled dynamics of planar walking and vertical walking\nheight. This reduced-order model is utilized to optimize for long-term and\nshort-term safe trajectory plans.

    "abstract": "There exists a high variability in mobility data volumes across different\nregions, which deteriorates the performance of spatial recommender systems that\nrely on region-specific data. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer\nlearning framework called REFORMD, for continuous-time location prediction for\nregions with sparse checkin data. Specifically, we model user-specific\ncheckin-sequences in a region using a marked temporal point process (MTPP) with\nnormalizing flows to learn the inter-checkin time and geo-distributions. Later,\nwe transfer the model parameters of spatial and temporal flows trained on a\ndata-rich origin region for the next check-in and time prediction in a target\nregion with scarce checkin data. We capture the evolving region-specific\ncheckin dynamics for MTPP and spatial-temporal flows by maximizing the joint\nlikelihood of next checkin with three channels (1) checkin-category prediction,\n(2) checkin-time prediction, and (3) travel distance prediction. Extensive\nexperiments on different user mobility datasets across the U.S. and Japan show\nthat our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for modeling\ncontinuous-time sequences.

Surface Mount Technology (SMT) is the most common industrial\nmethod for manufacturing electric devices in which electrical components are\nmounted directly onto the surface of a Printed Circuit Board (PCB). Although\nthe expansion of electronic devices affects our lives in a productive way,\nfailures or defects in the manufacturing procedure of those devices might also\nbe counterproductive and even harmful in some cases. It is therefore desired\nand sometimes crucial to ensure zero-defect quality in electronic devices and\ntheir production. While traditional Image Processing (IP) techniques are not\nsufficient to produce a complete solution, other promising methods like Deep\nLearning (DL) might also be challenging for PCB inspection, mainly because such\nmethods require big adequate datasets which are missing, not available or not\nupdated in the rapidly growing field of PCBs. Thus, PCB inspection is\nconventionally performed manually by human experts. Unsupervised Learning (UL)\nmethods may potentially be suitable for PCB inspection, having learning\ncapabilities on the one hand, while not relying on large datasets on the other.\nIn this paper, we introduce ChangeChip, an automated and integrated change\ndetection system for defect detection in PCBs, from soldering defects to\nmissing or misaligned electronic elements, based on Computer Vision (CV) and\nUL. We achieve good quality defect detection by applying an unsupervised change\ndetection between images of a golden PCB (reference) and the inspected PCB\nunder various setting.

    "title": "DHA: End-to-End Joint Optimization of Data Augmentation Policy,  Hyper-parameter and Architecture",
    "abstract": "Automated machine learning (AutoML) usually involves several crucial\ncomponents, such as Data Augmentation (DA) policy, Hyper-Parameter Optimization\n(HPO), and Neural Architecture Search (NAS). Although many strategies have been\ndeveloped for automating these components in separation, joint optimization of\nthese components remains challenging due to the largely increased search\ndimension and the variant input types of each component. Meanwhile, conducting\nthese components in a sequence often requires careful coordination by human\nexperts and may lead to sub-optimal results. In parallel to this, the common\npractice of searching for the optimal architecture first and then retraining it\nbefore deployment in NAS often suffers from low performance correlation between\nthe search and retraining stages. An end-to-end solution that integrates the\nAutoML components and returns a ready-to-use model at the end of the search is\ndesirable. In view of these, we propose DHA, which achieves joint optimization\nof Data augmentation policy, Hyper-parameter and Architecture. Specifically,\nend-to-end NAS is achieved in a differentiable manner by optimizing a\ncompressed lower-dimensional feature space, while DA policy and HPO are updated\ndynamically at the same time. Experiments show that DHA achieves\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) results on various datasets, especially 77.4\\% accuracy\non ImageNet with cell based search space, which is higher than current SOTA by\n0.5\\%. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to efficiently and\njointly optimize DA policy, NAS, and HPO in an end-to-end manner without\nretraining.",

    "abstract": "Natural Language Generation (NLG) evaluation is a multifaceted task requiring\nassessment of multiple desirable criteria, e.g., fluency, coherency, coverage,\nrelevance, adequacy, overall quality, etc. Across existing datasets for 6 NLG\ntasks, we observe that the human evaluation scores on these multiple criteria\nare often not correlated. For example, there is a very low correlation between\nhuman scores on fluency and data coverage for the task of structured data to\ntext generation. This suggests that the current recipe of proposing new\nautomatic evaluation metrics for NLG by showing that they correlate well with\nscores assigned by humans for a single criteria (overall quality) alone is\ninadequate. Indeed, our extensive study involving 25 automatic evaluation\nmetrics across 6 different tasks and 18 different evaluation criteria shows\nthat there is no single metric which correlates well with human scores on all\ndesirable criteria, for most NLG tasks. Given this situation, we propose\nCheckLists for better design and evaluation of automatic metrics. We design\ntemplates which target a specific criteria (e.g., coverage) and perturb the\noutput such that the quality gets affected only along this specific criteria\n(e.g., the coverage drops). We show that existing evaluation metrics are not\nrobust against even such simple perturbations and disagree with scores assigned\nby humans to the perturbed output. The proposed templates thus allow for a\nfine-grained assessment of automatic evaluation metrics exposing their\nlimitations and will facilitate better design, analysis and evaluation of such\nmetrics.",

However, the bottleneck of VAE lies in the\nsoftmax computation over all items, such that it takes linear costs in the\nnumber of items to compute the loss and gradient for optimization. This hinders\nthe practical use due to millions of items in real-world scenarios. Importance\nsampling is an effective approximation method, based on which the sampled\nsoftmax has been derived. However, existing methods usually exploit the uniform\nor popularity sampler as proposal distributions, leading to a large bias of\ngradient estimation.

Based on the proposed\nproposals, we develop a fast Variational AutoEncoder (FastVAE) for\ncollaborative filtering.

Contrary to most existing deep human motion prediction\napproaches, the multimodal nature of MDN enables the generation of diverse\nfuture motion hypotheses, which well compensates for the strong stochastic\nambiguity aggregated by the single input and human motion uncertainty. In\ndesigning the loss function, we further introduce an energy-based prior over\nlearnable parameters of MDN to maintain motion coherence, as well as improve\nthe prediction accuracy.

    "abstract": "Open-domain dialogue generation in natural language processing (NLP) is by\ndefault a pure-language task, which aims to satisfy human need for daily\ncommunication on open-ended topics by producing related and informative\nresponses. In this paper, we point out that hidden images, named as visual\nimpressions (VIs), can be explored from the text-only data to enhance dialogue\nunderstanding and help generate better responses. Besides, the semantic\ndependency between an dialogue post and its response is complicated, e.g., few\nword alignments and some topic transitions. Therefore, the visual impressions\nof them are not shared, and it is more reasonable to integrate the response\nvisual impressions (RVIs) into the decoder, rather than the post visual\nimpressions (PVIs). However, both the response and its RVIs are not given\ndirectly in the test process. To handle the above issues, we propose a\nframework to explicitly construct VIs based on pure-language dialogue datasets\nand utilize them for better dialogue understanding and generation.\nSpecifically, we obtain a group of images (PVIs) for each post based on a\npre-trained word-image mapping model. These PVIs are used in a co-attention\nencoder to get a post representation with both visual and textual information.\nSince the RVIs are not provided directly during testing, we design a cascade\ndecoder that consists of two sub-decoders. The first sub-decoder predicts the\ncontent words in response, and applies the word-image mapping model to get\nthose RVIs. Then, the second sub-decoder generates the response based on the\npost and RVIs.

    "abstract": "With the increasing scale and diversification of interaction behaviors in\nE-commerce, more and more researchers pay attention to multi-behavior\nrecommender systems which utilize interaction data of other auxiliary\nbehaviors. However, all existing models ignore two kinds of intrinsic\nheterogeneity which are helpful to capture the difference of user preferences\nand the difference of item attributes. First (intra-heterogeneity), each user\nhas multiple social identities with otherness, and these different identities\ncan result in quite different interaction preferences. Second\n(inter-heterogeneity), each item can transfer an item-specific percentage of\nscore from low-level behavior to high-level behavior for the gradual\nrelationship among multiple behaviors. Thus, the lack of consideration of these\nheterogeneities damages recommendation rank performance. To model the above\nheterogeneities, we propose a novel method named intra- and inter-heterogeneity\nrecommendation model (ARGO). Specifically, we embed each user into multiple\nvectors representing the user's identities, and the maximum of identity scores\nindicates the interaction preference. Besides, we regard the item-specific\ntransition percentage as trainable transition probability between different\nbehaviors.

As a result, ADS are\nprone to deficient oversight and calibration, which can lead to undesirable\n(e.g., unfair) outcomes. In this work, we conduct an online study with 200\nparticipants to examine people's perceptions of fairness and trustworthiness\ntowards ADS in comparison to a scenario where a human instead of an ADS makes a\nhigh-stakes decision -- and we provide thorough identical explanations\nregarding decisions in both cases. Surprisingly, we find that people perceive\nADS as fairer than human decision-makers. Our analyses also suggest that\npeople's AI literacy affects their perceptions, indicating that people with\nhigher AI literacy favor ADS more strongly over human decision-makers, whereas\nlow-AI-literacy people exhibit no significant differences in their perceptions.",

    "abstract": "Lexically constrained sentence generation allows the incorporation of prior\nknowledge such as lexical constraints into the output. This technique has been\napplied to machine translation, and dialog response generation. Previous work\nusually used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to generate lexically\nconstrained sentences, but they randomly determined the position to be edited\nand the action to be taken, resulting in many invalid refinements. To overcome\nthis challenge, we used a classifier to instruct the MCMC-based models where\nand how to refine the candidate sentences. First, we developed two methods to\ncreate synthetic data on which the pre-trained model is fine-tuned to obtain a\nreliable classifier. Next, we proposed a two-step approach, \"Predict and\nRevise\", for constrained sentence generation. During the predict step, we\nleveraged the classifier to compute the learned prior for the candidate\nsentence. During the revise step, we resorted to MCMC sampling to revise the\ncandidate sentence by conducting a sampled action at a sampled position drawn\nfrom the learned prior. We compared our proposed models with many strong\nbaselines on two tasks, generating sentences with lexical constraints and text\ninfilling. Experimental results have demonstrated that our proposed model\nperforms much better than the previous work in terms of sentence fluency and\ndiversity.

We study the scenario of stochastic components\nthat are independent and Normally distributed. By generalizing results for the\nclass of linear functions to the sum of transformed linear functions, we show\nthat the (1+1)~EA can optimize the chance constrained setting without\nadditional constraints in time O(n log n). However, we show that imposing an\nadditional uniform constraint already leads to local optima for very restricted\nscenarios and an exponential optimization time for the (1+1)~EA. We therefore\npropose a multi-objective formulation of the problem which trades off the\nexpected cost and its variance. We show that multi-objective evolutionary\nalgorithms are highly effective when using this formulation and obtain a set of\nsolutions that contains an optimal solution for any possible confidence level\nimposed on the constraint.

These disruptive\ntechnologies largely rely on high-speed internet connectivity, Cloud\ntechnologies, Augmented Reality, Additive Manufacturing, Data science and\nArtificial Intelligence. Most developed economies have embraced the it while\nthe developing economies are struggling to adopt 4IR because they lack the\nrequisite skills, knowledge and technology. Thus, this study investigates\nNigeria as one of the developing economies to understand her readiness for 4IR\nand the level of preparedness to mitigate the sophisticated cyber-attacks that\ncomes with it. The investigation adopted quantitative research approach and\ndeveloped an online questionnaire that was shared amongst the population of\ninterest that includes academic, industry experts and relevant stakeholders.\nThe questionnaire returned 116 valid responses which were analysed with\ndescriptive statistical tools in SPSS. Results suggest that 60 of the\nrespondents opined that Nigerian government at are not showing enough evidence\nto demonstrate her preparedness to leverage these promised potentials by\ndeveloping 4IR relevant laws, strong institutional frameworks and policies.\nThey lack significant development capacity to mitigate risks associated with\ndigital ecosystem and cyber ecosystem that are ushered in by the 4IR. In the\nuniversities, 52 of the courses offered at the undergraduate and 42 at the\npost-graduate levels are relevant in the development of skills required in the\nrevolution. The study recommends that the government at all levels make\nadequate efforts in developing the countrys intangible assets. In all, this\npaper posits that successful implementation of these could equip Nigeria to\nembrace the 4IR in all its aspects.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we present a novel technique for the simulation of moving\nboundaries and moving rigid bodies immersed in a rarefied gas using an\nEulerian-Lagrangian formulation based on least square method. The rarefied gas\nis simulated by solving the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) model for the Boltzmann\nequation of rarefied gas dynamics.\nThe BGK model is solved by an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method,\nwhere grid-points/particles are moved with the mean velocity of the gas.\nThe computational domain for the rarefied gas changes with time due to the\nmotion of the boundaries. To allow a simpler handling of the interface motion\nwe have used a meshfree method based on a least-square approximation for the\nreconstruction procedures required for the scheme.\nWe have considered a one way, as well as a two-way coupling of\nboundaries/rigid bodies and gas flow. The numerical results are compared with\nanalytical as well as with Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) solutions of\nthe Boltzmann equation. Convergence studies are performed for one-dimensional\nand two-dimensional test-cases. Several further test problems and applications\nillustrate the versatility of the approach.",

    "title": "Adversarial Bone Length Attack on Action Recognition",
    "abstract": "Skeleton-based action recognition models have recently been shown to be\nvulnerable to adversarial attacks. Compared to adversarial attacks on images,\nperturbations to skeletons are typically bounded to a lower dimension of\napproximately 100 per frame. This lower-dimensional setting makes it more\ndifficult to generate imperceptible perturbations. Existing attacks resolve\nthis by exploiting the temporal structure of the skeleton motion so that the\nperturbation dimension increases to thousands. In this paper, we show that\nadversarial attacks can be performed on skeleton-based action recognition\nmodels, even in a significantly low-dimensional setting without any temporal\nmanipulation. Specifically, we restrict the perturbations to the lengths of the\nskeleton's bones, which allows an adversary to manipulate only approximately 30\neffective dimensions. We conducted experiments on the NTU RGB+D and HDM05\ndatasets and demonstrate that the proposed attack successfully deceived models\nwith sometimes greater than 90\\% success rate by small perturbations.\nFurthermore, we discovered an interesting phenomenon: in our low-dimensional\nsetting, the adversarial training with the bone length attack shares a similar\nproperty with data augmentation, and it not only improves the adversarial\nrobustness but also improves the classification accuracy on the original\noriginal data. This is an interesting counterexample of the trade-off between\nadversarial robustness and clean accuracy, which has been widely observed in\nstudies on adversarial training in the high-dimensional regime.",

The design of new products from polymer composite\nmaterials, both within the framework of the traditional and new direction of\ncloud production, requires the need to calculate the physical and mechanical\ncharacteristics of the product at the design stage. Carrying out full-scale\ntests increases greatly the cost and slows down the production. It requires the\nmanufacture of a prototype of the product. The use of existing development\ntools does not always provide the required characteristics. To solve this\nproblem, it is proposed to use a digital twin, which will not only solve the\nproblem, but will also help to move to cloud production and the development of\nthe Industry 4.0 direction. Thus, a new problem arises - how to create digital\ntwins of products from polymer composite materials. The analysis makes it\npossible to conclude that the traditional methods of mathematical physics are\nnot suitable for the solution of this problem, since the twins obtained with\ntheir help do not have any properties of adaptability. To solve the problem, it\nis proposed to use deep neural networks one of the most powerful methods of\nmachine learning.

In this paper, we\nacknowledge that auxiliary data may not always be available in practice and\nfocus on the statistic-based approach. However, recent work on model poisoning\nattacks have shown that well-crafted attacks can circumvent most of existing\nmedian- and distance-based statistical defense methods, making malicious\ngradients indistinguishable from honest ones. To tackle this challenge, we show\nthat the element-wise sign of gradient vector can provide valuable insight in\ndetecting model poisoning attacks. Based on our theoretical analysis of\nstate-of-the-art attack, we propose a novel approach, \\textit{SignGuard}, to\nenable Byzantine-robust federated learning through collaborative malicious\ngradient filtering. More precisely, the received gradients are first processed\nto generate relevant magnitude, sign, and similarity statistics, which are then\ncollaboratively utilized by multiple, parallel filters to eliminate malicious\ngradients before final aggregation. We further provide theoretical analysis of\nSignGuard by quantifying its convergence with appropriate choice of learning\nrate and under non-IID training data. Finally, extensive experiments of image\nand text classification tasks - including MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and\nAG-News - are conducted together with recently proposed attacks and defense\nstrategies.

    "abstract": "Cardinality estimation (CardEst) plays a significant role in generating\nhigh-quality query plans for a query optimizer in DBMS. In the last decade, an\nincreasing number of advanced CardEst methods (especially ML-based) have been\nproposed with outstanding estimation accuracy and inference latency. However,\nthere exists no study that systematically evaluates the quality of these\nmethods and answer the fundamental problem: to what extent can these methods\nimprove the performance of query optimizer in real-world settings, which is the\nultimate goal of a CardEst method. In this paper, we comprehensively and\nsystematically compare the effectiveness of CardEst methods in a real DBMS. We\nestablish a new benchmark for CardEst, which contains a new complex realworld\ndataset STATS and a diverse query workload STATS-CEB. We integrate multiple\nmost representative CardEst methods into an open-source database system\nPostgreSQL, and comprehensively evaluate their true effectiveness in improving\nquery plan quality, and other important aspects affecting their applicability,\nranging from inference latency, model size, and training time, to update\nefficiency and accuracy. We obtain a number of key findings for the CardEst\nmethods, under different data and query settings. Furthermore, we find that the\nwidely used estimation accuracy metric(Q-Error) cannot distinguish the\nimportance of different sub-plan queries during query optimization and thus\ncannot truly reflect the query plan quality generated by CardEst methods.\nTherefore, we propose a new metric P-Error to evaluate the performance of\nCardEst methods, which overcomes the limitation of Q-Error and is able to\nreflect the overall end-to-end performance of CardEst methods. We have made all\nof the benchmark data and evaluation code publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/Nathaniel-Han/Endto-End-CardEst-Benchmark.",

    "abstract": "There is an explosive growth in the size of the input and/or intermediate\ndata used and generated by modern and emerging applications. Unfortunately,\nmodern computing systems are not capable of handling large amounts of data\nefficiently. Major concepts and components (e.g., the virtual memory system)\nand predominant execution models (e.g., the processor-centric execution model)\nused in almost all computing systems are designed without having modern\napplications' overwhelming data demand in mind. As a result, accessing, moving,\nand processing large amounts of data faces important challenges in today's\nsystems, making data a first-class concern and a prime performance and energy\nbottleneck in such systems. This thesis studies the root cause of inefficiency\nin modern computing systems when handling modern applications' data demand, and\naims to fundamentally address such inefficiencies, with a focus on two\ndirections. First, we design SIMDRAM, an end-to-end processing-using-DRAM\nframework that aids the widespread adoption of processing-using-DRAM, a\ndata-centric computation paradigm that improves the overall performance and\nefficiency of the system when computing large amounts of data by minimizing the\ncost of data movement and enabling computation where the data resides. Second,\nwe introduce the Virtual Block Interface (VBI), a novel virtual memory\nframework that 1) eliminates the inefficiencies of the conventional virtual\nmemory frameworks when handling the high memory demand in modern applications,\nand 2) is built from the ground up to understand, convey, and exploit data\nproperties, to create opportunities for performance and efficiency\nimprovements.",

Given\na TSN-based distributed architecture, a set of applications with tasks and\nmessages, as well as a set of security and redundancy requirements, we are\ninterested to synthesize a system configuration such that the real-time, safety\nand security requirements are upheld. We use the Timed Efficient Stream\nLoss-Tolerant Authentication (TESLA) low-resource multicast authentication\nprotocol to guarantee the security requirements, and redundant disjunct message\nroutes to tolerate link failures. We consider that tasks are dispatched using a\nstatic cyclic schedule table and that the messages use the time-sensitive\ntraffic class in TSN, which relies on schedule tables (called Gate Control\nLists, GCLs) in the network switches. A configuration consists of the schedule\ntables for tasks as well as the disjoint routes and GCLs for messages. We\npropose a Constraint Programming-based formulation which can be used to find an\noptimal solution with respect to our cost function.

These engines rely on algorithms\nthat learn to rank items so as to present an ordered list maximizing the\nprobability that it contains relevant item. The main challenge in the design of\nlearning-to-rank algorithms stems from the fact that queries often have\ndifferent meanings for different users. In absence of any contextual\ninformation about the query, one often has to adhere to the {\\it diversity}\nprinciple, i.e., to return a list covering the various possible topics or\nmeanings of the query. To formalize this learning-to-rank problem, we propose a\nnatural model where (i) items are categorized into topics, (ii) users find\nitems relevant only if they match the topic of their query, and (iii) the\nengine is not aware of the topic of an arriving query, nor of the frequency at\nwhich queries related to various topics arrive, nor of the topic-dependent\nclick-through-rates of the items. For this problem, we devise LDR (Learning\nDiverse Rankings), an algorithm that efficiently learns the optimal list based\non users' feedback only. We show that after $T$ queries, the regret of LDR\nscales as $O((N-L)\\log(T))$ where $N$ is the number of all items. We further\nestablish that this scaling cannot be improved, i.e., LDR is order optimal.\nFinally, using numerical experiments on both artificial and real-world data, we\nillustrate the superiority of LDR compared to existing learning-to-rank\nalgorithms.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural network image classifiers are known to be susceptible not only to\nadversarial examples created for them but even those created for others. This\nphenomenon poses a potential security risk in various black-box systems relying\non image classifiers. The reason behind such transferability of adversarial\nexamples is not yet fully understood and many studies have proposed training\nmethods to obtain classifiers with low transferability. In this study, we\naddress this problem from a novel perspective through investigating the\ncontribution of the network architecture to transferability. Specifically, we\npropose an architecture searching framework that employs neuroevolution to\nevolve network architectures and the gradient misalignment loss to encourage\nnetworks to converge into dissimilar functions after training. Our experiments\nshow that the proposed framework successfully discovers architectures that\nreduce transferability from four standard networks including ResNet and VGG,\nwhile maintaining a good accuracy on unperturbed images. In addition, the\nevolved networks trained with gradient misalignment exhibit significantly lower\ntransferability compared to standard networks trained with gradient\nmisalignment, which indicates that the network architecture plays an important\nrole in reducing transferability. This study demonstrates that designing or\nexploring proper network architectures is a promising approach to tackle the\ntransferability issue and train adversarially robust image classifiers.",

    "abstract": "Constraint acquisition systems such as QuAcq and MultiAcq can assist\nnon-expert users to model their problems as constraint networks by classifying\n(partial) examples as positive or negative. For each negative example, the\nformer focuses on one constraint of the target network, while the latter can\nlearn a maximum number of constraints. Two bottlenecks of the acquisition\nprocess where both these algorithms encounter problems are the large number of\nqueries required to reach convergence, and the high cpu times needed to\ngenerate queries, especially near convergence. In this paper we propose\nalgorithmic and heuristic methods to deal with both these issues. We first\ndescribe an algorithm, called MQuAcq, that blends the main idea of MultiAcq\ninto QuAcq resulting in a method that learns as many constraints as MultiAcq\ndoes after a negative example, but with a lower complexity. A detailed\ntheoretical analysis of the proposed algorithm is also presented. %We also\npresent a technique that boosts the performance of constraint acquisition by\nreducing the number of queries significantly. Then we turn our attention to\nquery generation which is a significant but rather overlooked part of the\nacquisition process. We describe %in detail how query generation in a typical\nconstraint acquisition system operates, and we propose heuristics for improving\nits efficiency. Experiments from various domains demonstrate that our resulting\nalgorithm that integrates all the new techniques does not only generate\nconsiderably fewer queries than QuAcq and MultiAcq, but it is also by far\nfaster than both of them, in average query generation time as well as in total\nrun time, and also largely alleviates the premature convergence problem.",

The present work exploits the advantages of both the phase-field\nmodel and Gridap toolbox for simulating fracture in brittle materials. On one\nhand, the use of the phase-field model, which is a continuum approach and uses\na diffuse representation of sharp cracks, enables the proposed implementation\nto overcome such well-known drawbacks of the discrete approach for predicting\ncomplex crack paths as the need for re-meshing, enrichment of finite element\nshape functions and an explicit tracking of the crack surfaces. On the other\nhand, the use of Gridap makes the proposed implementation very compact and\nuser-friendly that requires low memory usage, and provides a high degree of\nflexibility to the users in defining weak forms of partial differential\nequations. A test on a notched beam under symmetric three-point bending and a\nset of tests on a notched beam with three holes under asymmetric three-point\nbending is considered to demonstrate how the proposed Gridap based phase-field\nJulia code can be used to simulate fracture in brittle materials.",

V-SysId\ntakes keypoint trajectory proposals and alternates between maximum likelihood\nparameter estimation and extrinsic camera calibration, before applying a\nsuitable selection criterion to identify the track of interest. This is then\nused to train a keypoint tracking model using supervised learning. Results on a\nrange of settings (robotics, physics, physiology) highlight the utility of this\napproach.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of recommending relevant products to users in relatively\nresource-scarce markets by leveraging data from similar, richer in resource\nauxiliary markets. We hypothesize that data from one market can be used to\nimprove performance in another. Only a few studies have been conducted in this\narea, partly due to the lack of publicly available experimental data. To this\nend, we collect and release XMarket, a large dataset covering 18 local markets\non 16 different product categories, featuring 52.5 million user-item\ninteractions. We introduce and formalize the problem of cross-market product\nrecommendation, i.e., market adaptation. We explore different market-adaptation\ntechniques inspired by state-of-the-art domain-adaptation and meta-learning\napproaches and propose a novel neural approach for market adaptation, named\nFOREC. Our model follows a three-step procedure -- pre-training, forking, and\nfine-tuning -- in order to fully utilize the data from an auxiliary market as\nwell as the target market. We conduct extensive experiments studying the impact\nof market adaptation on different pairs of markets. Our proposed approach\ndemonstrates robust effectiveness, consistently improving the performance on\ntarget markets compared to competitive baselines selected for our analysis. In\nparticular, FOREC improves on average 24% and up to 50% in terms of nDCG@10,\ncompared to the NMF baseline. Our analysis and experiments suggest specific\nfuture directions in this research area.

To measure room pleasantness, we developed and\ndeployed ComFeel, an indoor environmental sensing infrastructure, which\ncaptures light, temperature, and gas resistance readings through miniaturized\nand unobtrusive devices we built and named 'Geckos'. Across 29 real-world\nmeetings, using ComFeel, we collected 1373 minutes of readings. For each of\nthese meetings, we also collected whether each participant felt the meeting to\nhave been productive, the setting to be psychologically safe, and the meeting\nroom to be pleasant. As one expects, we found that, on average, the probability\nof a meeting being productive increased by 35% for each standard deviation\nincrease in the psychological safety participants experienced.

In contrast, imitating the other similar robots is a much more\nchallenging task in robotics. This problem is called cross domain imitation\nlearning~(CDIL). In this paper, we consider CDIL on a class of similar robots.\nWe tackle this problem by introducing an imitation learning algorithm based on\ninvariant representation. We propose to learn invariant state and action\nrepresentations, which aligns the behavior of multiple robots so that CDIL\nbecomes possible. Compared with previous invariant representation learning\nmethods for similar purpose, our method does not require human-labeled pairwise\ndata for training. Instead, we use cycle-consistency and domain confusion to\nalign the representation and increase its robustness. We test the algorithm on\nmultiple robots in simulator and show that unseen new robot instances can be\ntrained with existing expert demonstrations successfully.

Despite a significant body of work dedicated to the study of this\nproblem in the data stream model, the state-of-the-art single-pass\nsemi-streaming algorithm for it is still a simple greedy algorithm that\ncomputes a maximal matching, and this way obtains 1/2-approximation. Some\nprevious works described two/three-pass algorithms that improve over this\napproximation ratio by using their second and third passes to improve the above\nmentioned maximal matching. One contribution of this paper continuous this line\nof work by presenting new three-pass semi-streaming algorithms that work along\nthese lines and obtain improved approximation ratios of 0.6111 and 0.5694 for\ntriangle-free and general graphs, respectively.\nUnfortunately, a recent work (Konrad and Naidu, 2021) shows that the strategy\nof constructing a maximal matching in the first pass and then improving it in\nfurther passes has limitations. Additionally, this technique is unlikely to get\nus closer to single-pass semi-streaming algorithms obtaining a better than\n1/2-approximation. Therefore, it is interesting to come up with algorithms that\ndo something else with their first pass (we term such algorithms\nnon-maximal-matching-first algorithms).

    "abstract": "Information seeking conversations between users and Conversational Search\nAgents (CSAs) consist of multiple turns of interaction. While users initiate a\nsearch session, ideally a CSA should sometimes take the lead in the\nconversation by obtaining feedback from the user by offering query suggestions\nor asking for query clarifications i.e. mixed initiative. This creates the\npotential for more engaging conversational searches, but substantially\nincreases the complexity of modelling and evaluating such scenarios due to the\nlarge interaction space coupled with the trade-offs between the costs and\nbenefits of the different interactions. In this paper, we present a model for\nconversational search -- from which we instantiate different observed\nconversational search strategies, where the agent elicits: (i) Feedback-First,\nor (ii) Feedback-After. Using 49 TREC WebTrack Topics, we performed an analysis\ncomparing how well these different strategies combine with different mixed\ninitiative approaches: (i) Query Suggestions vs. (ii) Query Clarifications. Our\nanalysis reveals that there is no superior or dominant combination, instead it\nshows that query clarifications are better when asked first, while query\nsuggestions are better when asked after presenting results. We also show that\nthe best strategy and approach depends on the trade-offs between the relative\ncosts between querying and giving feedback, the performance of the initial\nquery, the number of assessments per query, and the total amount of gain\nrequired. While this work highlights the complexities and challenges involved\nin analyzing CSAs, it provides the foundations for evaluating conversational\nstrategies and conversational search agents in batch/offline settings.",

    "title": "Balancing the Budget: Feature Selection and Tracking for Multi-Camera  Visual-Inertial Odometry",
    "abstract": "We present a multi-camera visual-inertial odometry system based on factor\ngraph optimization which estimates motion by using all cameras simultaneously\nwhile retaining a fixed overall feature budget. We focus on motion tracking in\nchallenging environments such as in narrow corridors and dark spaces with\naggressive motions and abrupt lighting changes. These scenarios cause\ntraditional monocular or stereo odometry to fail. While tracking motion across\nextra cameras should theoretically prevent failures, it causes additional\ncomplexity and computational burden. To overcome these challenges, we introduce\ntwo novel methods to improve multi-camera feature tracking. First, instead of\ntracking features separately in each camera, we track features continuously as\nthey move from one camera to another. This increases accuracy and achieves a\nmore compact factor graph representation. Second, we select a fixed budget of\ntracked features which are spread across the cameras to ensure that the limited\ncomputational budget is never exceeded. We have found that using a smaller set\nof informative features can maintain the same tracking accuracy while reducing\nback-end optimization time. Our proposed method was extensively tested using a\nhardware-synchronized device containing an IMU and four cameras (a front stereo\npair and two lateral) in scenarios including an underground mine, large open\nspaces, and building interiors with narrow stairs and corridors. Compared to\nstereo-only state-of-the-art VIO methods, our approach reduces the drift rate\n(RPE) by up to 80% in translation and 39% in rotation.",

However, special consideration\nmust be given when combining adaptive meshing procedures with ensemble-based\ndata assimilation (DA) techniques. In particular, we focus on the case where\neach ensemble member evolvesindependently upon its own mesh and is interpolated\nto a common mesh for the DA update. This paper outlines aframework to develop\ntime-dependent reference meshes using locations of observations and the metric\ntensors (MTs)or monitor functions that define the spatial meshes of the\nensemble members. We develop a time-dependent spatiallocalization scheme based\non the metric tensor (MT localization). We also explore how adaptive moving\nmesh tech-niques can control and inform the placement of mesh points to\nconcentrate near the location of observations, reducingthe error of observation\ninterpolation. This is especially beneficial when we have observations in\nlocations that wouldotherwise have a sparse spatial discretization. We\nillustrate the utility of our results using discontinuous Galerkin(DG)\napproximations of 1D and 2D inviscid Burgers equations. The numerical results\nshow that the MT localizationscheme compares favorably with standard\nGaspari-Cohn localization techniques.

Recent passive WiFi tracking systems face the challenges of inaccurate\nseparation of dynamic human components and time-consuming estimation of\nmulti-dimensional signal parameters. In this work, we present a scheme named\nWiFi Doppler Frequency Shift (WiDFS), which can achieve single-target real-time\npassive tracking using channel state information (CSI) collected from\ncommercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) WiFi devices. We consider the typical system\nsetup including a transmitter with a single antenna and a receiver with three\nantennas; while our scheme can be readily extended to another setup. To remove\nthe impact of transceiver asynchronization, we first apply CSI\ncross-correlation between each RX antenna pair. We then combine them to\nestimate a Doppler frequency shift (DFS) in a short-time window. After that, we\nleverage the DFS estimate to separate dynamic human components from CSI\nself-correlation terms of each antenna, thereby separately calculating\nangle-of-arrival (AoA) and human reflection distance for tracking. In addition,\na hardware calibration algorithm is presented to refine the spacing between RX\nantennas and eliminate the hardware-related phase differences between them.

    "abstract": "Caching at the wireless edge nodes is a promising way to boost the spatial\nand spectral efficiency, for the sake of alleviating networks from\ncontent-related traffic. Coded caching originally introduced by Maddah-Ali and\nNiesen significantly speeds up communication efficiency by transmitting\nmulticast messages simultaneously useful to multiple users. Most prior works on\ncoded caching are based on the assumption that each user may request all\ncontent in the library. However, in many applications the users are interested\nonly in a limited set of content items that depends on their location. For\nexample, visitors in a museum may stream audio and video related to the\nartworks in the room they are visiting, or assisted self-driving vehicles may\naccess super-high definition maps of the area through which they are\ntravelling. Motivated by these considerations, this paper formulates the coded\ncaching problem for location-based content with edge cache nodes. The\nconsidered problem includes a content server with access to N location-based\nfiles, K edge cache nodes located at different regions, and K users each of\nwhich is in the serving region of one cache node and can retrieve the cached\ncontent of this cache node with negligible cost. Depending on the location,\neach user only requests a file from a location-dependent subset of the library.\nThe objective is to minimize the worst-case load transmitted from the content\nserver among all possible demands. We propose a highly non-trivial converse\nbound under uncoded cache placement, which shows that a simple achievable\nscheme is optimal. In addition, this achievable scheme is generally order\noptimal within 3.

Motivated by Yeom et al.'s membership inference\nframework, we propose a formal and general definition of property inference\nattacks. The proposed notion describes attacks that can distinguish between\npossible training distributions, extending beyond previous property inference\nattacks that infer the ratio of a particular type of data in the training data\nset such as the proportion of females. We show how our definition captures\nprevious property inference attacks as well as a new attack that can reveal the\naverage node degree or clustering coefficient of a training graph. Our\ndefinition also enables a theorem that connects the maximum possible accuracy\nof inference attacks distinguishing between distributions to the effective size\nof dataset leaked by the model. To quantify and understand property inference\nrisks, we conduct a series of experiments across a range of different\ndistributions using both black-box and white-box attacks. Our results show that\ninexpensive attacks are often as effective as expensive meta-classifier\nattacks, and that there are surprising asymmetries in the effectiveness of\nattacks. We also extend the state-of-the-art property inference attack to work\non convolutional neural networks, and propose techniques to help identify\nparameters in a model that leak the most information, thus significantly\nlowering resource requirements for meta-classifier attacks.",

    "title": "Predictable universally unique identification of sequential events on  complex objects",
    "abstract": "Universal identifiers and hashing have been widely adopted in computer\nscience from distributed financial transactions to data science. This is a\nconsequence of their capability to avoid many shortcomings of relative\nidentifiers, such as limited scope and the need for central management.\nHowever, the current identifiers in use are isolated entities which cannot\nprovide much information about the relationship between objects. As an example,\nif one has both the identifiers of an object and its transformed version, no\ninformation about how they are related can be obtained without resorting to\nsome kind of authority or additionally appended information. Moreover, given an\ninput object and an arbitrarily long sequence of costly steps, one cannot\ncurrently predict the identifier of the outcome without actually processing the\nentire sequence. The capability of predicting the resulting identifier and\navoiding redundant calculations is highly desirable in an efficient unmanaged\nsystem. In this paper, we propose a new kind of unique identifier that is\ncalculated from the list of events that can produce an object, instead of\ndirectly identifying it by content. This provides an identification scheme\nregardless of the object's current existence, thus allowing to inexpensively\ncheck for its content in a database and retrieve it when it has already been\ncalculated before. These identifiers are proposed in the context of abstract\nalgebra, where objects are represented by elements that can be operated\naccording to useful properties, such as associativity, order sensitivity when\ndesired, and reversibility, while simplicity of implementation and strong\nguarantees are given by well known group theory results.",

However, when rating an item concerning a specific user, most\nof the recommendation algorithms tend to rely too much on his/her rating\n(feedback) history. This introduces implicit bias on the recommendation system,\nwhich is referred to as user feedback-loop bias in this paper. We propose a\nsystematic and dynamic way to correct such bias and to obtain more diverse and\nobjective recommendations by utilizing temporal rating information.\nSpecifically, our method includes a deep-learning component to learn each\nuser's dynamic rating history embedding for the estimation of the probability\ndistribution of the items that the user rates sequentially. These estimated\ndynamic exposure probabilities are then used as propensity scores to train an\ninverse-propensity-scoring (IPS) rating predictor. We empirically validated the\nexistence of such user feedback-loop bias in real world recommendation systems\nand compared the performance of our method with the baseline models that are\neither without de-biasing or with propensity scores estimated by other methods.\nThe results show the superiority of our approach.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the relationship between Orthogonal Time Frequency Space\n(OTFS) modulation and Orthogonal Short Time Fourier (OSTF) signaling. OTFS was\nrecently proposed as a new scheme for high Doppler scenarios and builds on\nOSTF. We first show that the two schemes are unitarily equivalent in the\ndigital domain. However, OSTF defines the analog-digital interface with the\nwaveform domain. We then develop a critically sampled matrix-vector model for\nthe two systems and consider linear minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) filtering\nat the receiver to suppress inter-symbol interference. Initial comparison of\ncapacity and (uncoded) probability of error reveals a surprising observation:\nOTFS under-performs OSTF in capacity but over-performs in probability of error.\nThis result can be attributed to characteristics of the channel matrices\ninduced by the two systems. In particular, the diagonal entries of OTFS matrix\nexhibit nearly identical magnitude, whereas those of the OSTF matrix exhibit\nwild fluctuations induced by multipath randomness. It is observed that by\nsimply replacing the unitary matrix, relating OTFS to OSTF, by an arbitrary\nunitary matrix results in performance nearly identical to OTFS. We then extend\nour analysis to orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and also\nconsider a more extreme scenario of relatively large delay and Doppler spreads.\nOur results demonstrate the significance of using OSTF basis waveforms rather\nthan sinusoidal ones in OFDM in highly dynamic environments, and also highlight\nthe impact of the level of channel state information used at the receiver.",

For\nstandard DPO rewriting without interfaces, confluence for terminating rewrite\nsystems is, in general, undecidable.

We apply this\nresult to give effective procedures for deciding local confluence of symmetric\nmonoidal theories with and without Frobenius structure by critical pair\nanalysis. For the latter, we introduce the new notion of path joinability for\ncritical pairs, which enables finitely many joins of a critical pair to be\nlifted to an arbitrary context in spite of the strong non-local constraints\nplaced on rewriting in a generic symmetric monoidal theory.",

Moreover, non-English sources of labelled data are often\nscarce and present additional challenges. Recently, large multilingual language\nmodels have substantially improved the performance on many non-English tasks,\nespecially such with limited numbers of examples. This highlights the\nimportance of model pre-training and its ability to learn from few examples.

For our\nexperiments, we build on pattern-exploiting training, proposing the addition of\na novel label encoder to simplify the verbalisation procedure.

    "abstract": "Zero-shot object detection (ZSD), the task that extends conventional\ndetection models to detecting objects from unseen categories, has emerged as a\nnew challenge in computer vision. Most existing approaches tackle the ZSD task\nwith a strict mapping-transfer strategy, which may lead to suboptimal ZSD\nresults: 1) the learning process of those models ignores the available unseen\nclass information, and thus can be easily biased towards the seen categories;\n2) the original visual feature space is not well-structured and lack of\ndiscriminative information. To address these issues, we develop a novel\nSemantics-Guided Contrastive Network for ZSD, named ContrastZSD, a detection\nframework that first brings contrastive learning mechanism into the realm of\nzero-shot detection. Particularly, ContrastZSD incorporates two\nsemantics-guided contrastive learning subnets that contrast between\nregion-category and region-region pairs respectively. The pairwise contrastive\ntasks take advantage of additional supervision signals derived from both ground\ntruth label and pre-defined class similarity distribution. Under the guidance\nof those explicit semantic supervision, the model can learn more knowledge\nabout unseen categories to avoid the bias problem to seen concepts, while\noptimizing the data structure of visual features to be more discriminative for\nbetter visual-semantic alignment. Extensive experiments are conducted on two\npopular benchmarks for ZSD, i.e., PASCAL VOC and MS COCO.

However, a major limitation of existing works is that they ignore the\ndependencies between spans (pairs).

In particular, we propose a group packing strategy to enable our\nmodel to process massive spans together to consider their dependencies with\nlimited resources. Furthermore, for those more complicated span pair\nclassification tasks, we design a subject-oriented packing strategy, which\npacks each subject and all its objects into an instance to model the\ndependencies between the same-subject span pairs. Our experiments show that our\nmodel with packed levitated markers outperforms the sequence labeling model by\n0.4%-1.9% F1 on three flat NER tasks, beats the token concat model on six NER\nbenchmarks, and obtains a 3.5%-3.6% strict relation F1 improvement with higher\nspeed over previous SOTA models on ACE04 and ACE05.

    "abstract": "We study the online influence maximization (OIM) problem in social networks,\nwhere in multiple rounds the learner repeatedly chooses seed nodes to generate\ncascades, observes the cascade feedback, and gradually learns the best seeds\nthat generate the largest cascade. We focus on two major challenges in this\npaper. First, we work with node-level feedback instead of edge-level feedback.\nThe edge-level feedback reveals all edges that pass through information in a\ncascade, where the node-level feedback only reveals the activated nodes with\ntimestamps. The node-level feedback is arguably more realistic since in\npractice it is relatively easy to observe who is influenced but very difficult\nto observe from which relationship (edge) the influence comes from. Second, we\nuse standard offline oracle instead of offline pair-oracle. To compute a good\nseed set for the next round, an offline pair-oracle finds the best seed set and\nthe best parameters within the confidence region simultaneously, and such an\noracle is difficult to compute due to the combinatorial core of OIM problem. So\nwe focus on how to use the standard offline influence maximization oracle which\nfinds the best seed set given the edge parameters as input. In this paper, we\nresolve these challenges for the two most popular diffusion models, the\nindependent cascade (IC) and the linear threshold (LT) model. For the IC model,\nthe past research only achieves edge-level feedback, while we present the first\n$\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$-regret algorithm for the node-level feedback.\nBesides, the algorithm only invokes standard offline oracles. For the LT model,\na recent study only provides an OIM solution that meets the first challenge but\nstill requires a pair-oracle. In this paper, we apply a similar technique as in\nthe IC model to replace the pair-oracle with a standard oracle while\nmaintaining $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$-regret.",

The LC maneuver is parsed into\ntwo stages: one is from the decision point to the execution point (finding a\nsuitable gap), and the other is from the execution point to the end point\n(performing the LC maneuver). Thereafter, a multiobjective optimization problem\nintegrating these two stages is constructed, in which the comfort, efficiency\nand safety of the LC vehicle and the surrounding vehicles are simultaneously\nconsidered. Through introducing the NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic\nAlgorithm), the pareto-optimal frontier and pareto-optimal solution of this\nproblem is obtained.

    "abstract": "Video grounding aims to localize the temporal segment corresponding to a\nsentence query from an untrimmed video. Almost all existing video grounding\nmethods fall into two frameworks: 1) Top-down model: It predefines a set of\nsegment candidates and then conducts segment classification and regression. 2)\nBottom-up model: It directly predicts frame-wise probabilities of the\nreferential segment boundaries. However, all these methods are not end-to-end,\n\\ie, they always rely on some time-consuming post-processing steps to refine\npredictions. To this end, we reformulate video grounding as a set prediction\ntask and propose a novel end-to-end multi-modal Transformer model, dubbed as\n\\textbf{GTR}. Specifically, GTR has two encoders for video and language\nencoding, and a cross-modal decoder for grounding prediction. To facilitate the\nend-to-end training, we use a Cubic Embedding layer to transform the raw videos\ninto a set of visual tokens. To better fuse these two modalities in the\ndecoder, we design a new Multi-head Cross-Modal Attention. The whole GTR is\noptimized via a Many-to-One matching loss. Furthermore, we conduct\ncomprehensive studies to investigate different model design choices. Extensive\nresults on three benchmarks have validated the superiority of GTR. All three\ntypical GTR variants achieve record-breaking performance on all datasets and\nmetrics, with several times faster inference speed.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an efficient and generalizable framework based on\ndeep convolutional neural network (CNN) for multi-source remote sensing data\njoint classification. While recent methods are mostly based on multi-stream\narchitectures, we use group convolution to construct equivalent network\narchitectures efficiently within a single-stream network. We further adopt and\nimprove dynamic grouping convolution (DGConv) to make group convolution\nhyperparameters, and thus the overall network architecture, learnable during\nnetwork training. The proposed method therefore can theoretically adjust any\nmodern CNN models to any multi-source remote sensing data set, and can\npotentially avoid sub-optimal solutions caused by manually decided architecture\nhyperparameters. In the experiments, the proposed method is applied to ResNet\nand UNet, and the adjusted networks are verified on three very diverse\nbenchmark data sets (i.e., Houston2018 data, Berlin data, and MUUFL data).\nExperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nsingle-stream CNNs, and in particular ResNet18-DGConv improves the\nstate-of-the-art classification overall accuracy (OA) on HS-SAR Berlin data set\nfrom $62.23\\%$ to $68.21\\%$. In the experiments we have two interesting\nfindings. First, using DGConv generally reduces test OA variance. Second,\nmulti-stream is harmful to model performance if imposed to the first few\nlayers, but becomes beneficial if applied to deeper layers. Altogether, the\nfindings imply that multi-stream architecture, instead of being a strictly\nnecessary component in deep learning models for multi-source remote sensing\ndata, essentially plays the role of model regularizer.

However, it is well established that the\ncurrent DL methodology produces universally unstable neural networks (NNs). The\ninstability problem has caused an enormous research effort -- with a vast\nliterature on so-called adversarial attacks -- yet there has been no solution\nto the problem. Our paper addresses why there has been no solution to the\nproblem, as we prove the following mathematical paradox: any training procedure\nbased on training neural networks for classification problems with a fixed\narchitecture will yield neural networks that are either inaccurate or unstable\n(if accurate) -- despite the provable existence of both accurate and stable\nneural networks for the same classification problems. The key is that the\nstable and accurate neural networks must have variable dimensions depending on\nthe input, in particular, variable dimensions is a necessary condition for\nstability.\nOur result points towards the paradox that accurate and stable neural\nnetworks exist, however, modern algorithms do not compute them. This yields the\nquestion: if the existence of neural networks with desirable properties can be\nproven, can one also find algorithms that compute them? There are cases in\nmathematics where provable existence implies computability, but will this be\nthe case for neural networks? The contrary is true, as we demonstrate how\nneural networks can provably exist as approximate minimisers to standard\noptimisation problems with standard cost functions, however, no randomised\nalgorithm can compute them with probability better than 1/2.",

    "abstract": "Capitalization and punctuation are important cues for comprehending written\ntexts and conversational transcripts. Yet, many ASR systems do not produce\npunctuated and case-formatted speech transcripts. We propose to use a\nmulti-task system that can exploit the relations between casing and punctuation\nto improve their prediction performance. Whereas text data for predicting\npunctuation and truecasing is seemingly abundant, we argue that written text\nresources are inadequate as training data for conversational models. We\nquantify the mismatch between written and conversational text domains by\ncomparing the joint distributions of punctuation and word cases, and by testing\nour model cross-domain. Further, we show that by training the model in the\nwritten text domain and then transfer learning to conversations, we can achieve\nreasonable performance with less data.",

    "abstract": "Supervised learning is dominant in person search, but it requires elaborate\nlabeling of bounding boxes and identities. Large-scale labeled training data is\noften difficult to collect, especially for person identities. A natural\nquestion is whether a good person search model can be trained without the need\nof identity supervision. In this paper, we present a weakly supervised setting\nwhere only bounding box annotations are available. Based on this new setting,\nwe provide an effective baseline model termed Region Siamese Networks\n(R-SiamNets). Towards learning useful representations for recognition in the\nabsence of identity labels, we supervise the R-SiamNet with instance-level\nconsistency loss and cluster-level contrastive loss. For instance-level\nconsistency learning, the R-SiamNet is constrained to extract consistent\nfeatures from each person region with or without out-of-region context. For\ncluster-level contrastive learning, we enforce the aggregation of closest\ninstances and the separation of dissimilar ones in feature space. Extensive\nexperiments validate the utility of our weakly supervised method. Our model\nachieves the rank-1 of 87.1% and mAP of 86.0% on CUHK-SYSU benchmark, which\nsurpasses several fully supervised methods, such as OIM and MGTS, by a clear\nmargin. More promising performance can be reached by incorporating extra\ntraining data. We hope this work could encourage the future research in this\nfield.",

    "abstract": "Visual question answering (VQA) is challenging not only because the model has\nto handle multi-modal information, but also because it is just so hard to\ncollect sufficient training examples -- there are too many questions one can\nask about an image. As a result, a VQA model trained solely on human-annotated\nexamples could easily over-fit specific question styles or image contents that\nare being asked, leaving the model largely ignorant about the sheer diversity\nof questions. Existing methods address this issue primarily by introducing an\nauxiliary task such as visual grounding, cycle consistency, or debiasing. In\nthis paper, we take a drastically different approach. We found that many of the\n\"unknowns\" to the learned VQA model are indeed \"known\" in the dataset\nimplicitly. For instance, questions asking about the same object in different\nimages are likely paraphrases; the number of detected or annotated objects in\nan image already provides the answer to the \"how many\" question, even if the\nquestion has not been annotated for that image. Building upon these insights,\nwe present a simple data augmentation pipeline SimpleAug to turn this \"known\"\nknowledge into training examples for VQA. We show that these augmented examples\ncan notably improve the learned VQA models' performance, not only on the VQA-CP\ndataset with language prior shifts but also on the VQA v2 dataset without such\nshifts. Our method further opens up the door to leverage weakly-labeled or\nunlabeled images in a principled way to enhance VQA models.

But existing testing methods are\ninadequate for checking the end-to-end behaviors of AV controllers against\ncomplex, real-world corner cases involving interactions with multiple\nindependent agents such as pedestrians and human-driven vehicles. While\ntest-driving AVs on streets and highways fails to capture many rare events,\nexisting simulation-based testing methods mainly focus on simple scenarios and\ndo not scale well for complex driving situations that require sophisticated\nawareness of the surroundings. To address these limitations, we propose a new\nfuzz testing technique, called AutoFuzz, which can leverage widely-used AV\nsimulators' API grammars. to generate semantically and temporally valid complex\ndriving scenarios (sequences of scenes). AutoFuzz is guided by a constrained\nNeural Network (NN) evolutionary search over the API grammar to generate\nscenarios seeking to find unique traffic violations. Evaluation of our\nprototype on one state-of-the-art learning-based controller and two rule-based\ncontrollers shows that AutoFuzz efficiently finds hundreds of realistic traffic\nviolations resembling real-world crashes. Further, fine-tuning the\nlearning-based controller with the traffic violations found by AutoFuzz\nsuccessfully reduced the traffic violations found in the new version of the AV\ncontroller software.",

Many\nparallel applications contain fine-grained synchronization idioms; as such,\ntheir correct execution depends on a degree of relative forward progress\nbetween threads (or thread groups). Unfortunately, many GPU programming\nspecifications say almost nothing about relative forward progress guarantees\nbetween workgroups. Although prior work has proposed a spectrum of plausible\nprogress models for GPUs, cross-vendor specifications have yet to commit to any\nmodel.\nThis work is a collection of tools experimental data to aid specification\ndesigners when considering forward progress guarantees in programming\nframeworks. As a foundation, we formalize a small parallel programming language\nthat captures the essence of fine-grained synchronization. We then provide a\nmeans of formally specifying a progress model, and develop a termination oracle\nthat decides whether a given program is guaranteed to eventually terminate with\nrespect to a given progress model. Next, we formalize a constraint for\nconcurrent programs that require relative forward progress to terminate. Using\nthis constraint, we synthesize a large set of 483 progress litmus tests.\nCombined with the termination oracle, this allows us to determine the expected\nstatus of each litmus test -- i.e. whether it is guaranteed eventual\ntermination -- under various progress models. We present a large experimental\ncampaign running the litmus tests across 8 GPUs from 5 different vendors. Our\nresults highlight that GPUs have significantly different termination behaviors\nunder our test suite.

Prolonged conduction through the myocardium can occur with HF, and\na device-driven approach, termed cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), can\nimprove left ventricular (LV) myocardial conduction patterns. While a\nfunctional benefit of CRT has been demonstrated, a large proportion of HF\npatients (30-50%) receiving CRT do not show sufficient improvement. Moreover,\nidentifying HF patients that would benefit from CRT prospectively remains a\nclinical challenge. Accordingly, strategies to effectively predict those HF\npatients that would derive a functional benefit from CRT holds great medical\nand socio-economic importance. Thus, we used machine learning methods of\nclassifying HF patients, namely Cluster Analysis, Decision Trees, and\nArtificial neural networks, to develop predictive models of individual outcomes\nfollowing CRT. Clinical, functional, and biomarker data were collected in HF\npatients before and following CRT. A prospective 6-month endpoint of a\nreduction in LV volume was defined as a CRT response. Using this approach (418\nresponders, 412 non-responders), each with 56 parameters, we could classify HF\npatients based on their response to CRT with more than 95% success. We have\ndemonstrated that using machine learning approaches can identify HF patients\nwith a high probability of a positive CRT response (95% accuracy), and of equal\nimportance, identify those HF patients that would not derive a functional\nbenefit from CRT. Developing this approach into a clinical algorithm to assist\nin clinical decision-making regarding the use of CRT in HF patients would\npotentially improve outcomes and reduce health care costs.",

    "abstract": "Exponential tilting is a technique commonly used in fields such as\nstatistics, probability, information theory, and optimization to create\nparametric distribution shifts. Despite its prevalence in related fields,\ntilting has not seen widespread use in machine learning. In this work, we aim\nto bridge this gap by exploring the use of tilting in risk minimization. We\nstudy a simple extension to ERM -- tilted empirical risk minimization (TERM) --\nwhich uses exponential tilting to flexibly tune the impact of individual\nlosses. The resulting framework has several useful properties: We show that\nTERM can increase or decrease the influence of outliers, respectively, to\nenable fairness or robustness; has variance-reduction properties that can\nbenefit generalization; and can be viewed as a smooth approximation to a\nsuperquantile method. Our work makes rigorous connections between TERM and\nrelated objectives, such as Value-at-Risk, Conditional Value-at-Risk, and\ndistributionally robust optimization (DRO). We develop batch and stochastic\nfirst-order optimization methods for solving TERM, provide convergence\nguarantees for the solvers, and show that the framework can be efficiently\nsolved relative to common alternatives. Finally, we demonstrate that TERM can\nbe used for a multitude of applications in machine learning, such as enforcing\nfairness between subgroups, mitigating the effect of outliers, and handling\nclass imbalance. Despite the straightforward modification TERM makes to\ntraditional ERM objectives, we find that the framework can consistently\noutperform ERM and deliver competitive performance with state-of-the-art,\nproblem-specific approaches.",

    "abstract": "Object detection is a fundamental task in computer vision. While approaches\nfor axis-aligned bounding box detection have made substantial progress in\nrecent years, they perform poorly on oriented objects which are common in\nseveral real-world scenarios such as aerial view imagery and security camera\nfootage. In these cases, a large part of a predicted bounding box will,\nundesirably, cover non-object related areas. Therefore, oriented object\ndetection has emerged with the aim of generalizing object detection to\narbitrary orientations. This enables a tighter fit to oriented objects, leading\nto a better separation of bounding boxes especially in case of dense object\ndistributions. The vast majority of the work in this area has focused on\ncomplex two-stage anchor-based approaches. Anchors act as priors on the\nbounding box shape and require attentive hyper-parameter fine-tuning on a\nper-dataset basis, increased model size, and come with computational overhead.\nIn this work, we present DAFNe: A Dense one-stage Anchor-Free deep Network for\noriented object detection. As a one-stage model, DAFNe performs predictions on\na dense grid over the input image, being architecturally simpler and faster, as\nwell as easier to optimize than its two-stage counterparts. Furthermore, as an\nanchor-free model, DAFNe reduces the prediction complexity by refraining from\nemploying bounding box anchors. Moreover, we introduce an orientation-aware\ngeneralization of the center-ness function for arbitrarily oriented bounding\nboxes to down-weight low-quality predictions and a center-to-corner bounding\nbox prediction strategy that improves object localization performance. DAFNe\nimproves the prediction accuracy over the previous best one-stage anchor-free\nmodel results on DOTA 1.0 by 4.65% mAP, setting the new state-of-the-art\nresults by achieving 76.95% mAP.",

This circumstance suggests a need\nfor alternative learning approaches that do not require corresponding depth\nmeasurements. Indeed, self-supervised learning of depth estimation provides an\nincreasingly popular alternative. It is based on the idea that observed frames\ncan be synthesized from neighboring frames if accurate depth of the scene is\nknown - or in this case, estimated. We show empirically that - contrary to\ncommon belief - improvements in image synthesis do not necessitate improvement\nin depth estimation. Rather, optimizing for image synthesis can result in\ndiverging performance with respect to the main prediction objective - depth. We\nattribute this diverging phenomenon to aleatoric uncertainties, which originate\nfrom data. Based on our experiments on four datasets (spanning street, indoor,\nand medical) and five architectures (monocular and stereo), we conclude that\nthis diverging phenomenon is independent of the dataset domain and not\nmitigated by commonly used regularization techniques. To underscore the\nimportance of this finding, we include a survey of methods which use image\nsynthesis, totaling 127 papers over the last six years.

Most existing\nUDA methods focus on learning domain-invariant feature representation, either\nfrom the domain level or category level, using convolution neural networks\n(CNNs)-based frameworks. One fundamental problem for the category level based\nUDA is the production of pseudo labels for samples in target domain, which are\nusually too noisy for accurate domain alignment, inevitably compromising the\nUDA performance. With the success of Transformer in various tasks, we find that\nthe cross-attention in Transformer is robust to the noisy input pairs for\nbetter feature alignment, thus in this paper Transformer is adopted for the\nchallenging UDA task. Specifically, to generate accurate input pairs, we design\na two-way center-aware labeling algorithm to produce pseudo labels for target\nsamples. Along with the pseudo labels, a weight-sharing triple-branch\ntransformer framework is proposed to apply self-attention and cross-attention\nfor source/target feature learning and source-target domain alignment,\nrespectively. Such design explicitly enforces the framework to learn\ndiscriminative domain-specific and domain-invariant representations\nsimultaneously.

    "abstract": "Recent experimental achievements motivate an ever-growing interest from\ncompanies starting to feel the limitations of classical computing. Yet, in\nlight of ongoing privacy scandals, the future availability of quantum computing\nthrough remotely accessible servers pose peculiar challenges: Clients with\nquantum-limited capabilities want their data and algorithms to remain hidden,\nwhile being able to verify that their computations are performed correctly.\nResearch in blind and verifiable delegation of quantum computing attempts to\naddress this question. However, available techniques suffer not only from high\noverheads but also from over-sensitivity: When running on noisy devices,\nimperfections trigger the same detection mechanisms as malicious attacks,\nresulting in perpetually aborted computations. Hence, while malicious quantum\ncomputers are rendered harmless by blind and verifiable protocols, inherent\nnoise severely limits their usability.\nWe address this problem with an efficient, robust, blind, verifiable scheme\nto delegate deterministic quantum computations with classical inputs and\noutputs. We show that: 1) a malicious Server can cheat at most with an\nexponentially small success probability; 2) in case of sufficiently small\nnoise, the protocol succeeds with a probability exponentially close to 1; 3)\nthe overhead is barely a polynomial number of repetitions of the initial\ncomputation interleaved with test runs requiring the same physical resources in\nterms of memory and gates; 4) the amount of tolerable noise, measured by the\nprobability of failing a test run, can be as high as 25% for some computations\nand will be generally bounded by 12.5% when using a planar graph resource\nstate. The key points are that security can be provided without universal\ncomputation graphs and that, in our setting, full fault-tolerance is not needed\nto amplify the confidence level exponentially close to 1.",

    "abstract": "Red-lesions, i.e., microaneurysms (MAs) and hemorrhages (HMs), are the early\nsigns of diabetic retinopathy (DR). The automatic detection of MAs and HMs on\nretinal fundus images is a challenging task. Most of the existing methods\ndetect either only MAs or only HMs because of the difference in their texture,\nsizes, and morphology. Though some methods detect both MAs and HMs, they suffer\nfrom the curse of dimensionality of shape and colors features and fail to\ndetect all shape variations of HMs such as flame-shaped HM. Leveraging the\nprogress in deep learning, we proposed a two-stream red lesions detection\nsystem dealing simultaneously with small and large red lesions. For this\nsystem, we introduced a new ROIs candidates generation method for large red\nlesions fundus images; it is based on blood vessel segmentation and\nmorphological operations, and reduces the computational complexity, and\nenhances the detection accuracy by generating a small number of potential\ncandidates. For detection, we adapted the Faster RCNN framework with two\nstreams. We used pre-trained VGGNet as a bone model and carried out several\nextensive experiments to tune it for vessels segmentation and candidates\ngeneration, and finally learning the appropriate mapping, which yields better\ndetection of the red lesions comparing with the state-of-the-art methods. The\nexperimental results validated the effectiveness of the system in the detection\nof both MAs and HMs; the method yields higher performance for per lesion\ndetection according to sensitivity under 4 FPIs on DiaretDB1-MA and\nDiaretDB1-HM datasets, and 1 FPI on e-ophtha and ROCh datasets than the state\nof the art methods w.r.t. various evaluation metrics. For DR screening, the\nsystem outperforms other methods on DiaretDB1-MA, DiaretDB1-HM, and e-ophtha\ndatasets.",

    "abstract": "We present Free Point Transformer (FPT) - a deep neural network architecture\nfor non-rigid point-set registration. Consisting of two modules, a global\nfeature extraction module and a point transformation module, FPT does not\nassume explicit constraints based on point vicinity, thereby overcoming a\ncommon requirement of previous learning-based point-set registration methods.\nFPT is designed to accept unordered and unstructured point-sets with a variable\nnumber of points and uses a \"model-free\" approach without heuristic\nconstraints. Training FPT is flexible and involves minimizing an intuitive\nunsupervised loss function, but supervised, semi-supervised, and partially- or\nweakly-supervised training are also supported. This flexibility makes FPT\namenable to multimodal image registration problems where the ground-truth\ndeformations are difficult or impossible to measure. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate the application of FPT to non-rigid registration of prostate\nmagnetic resonance (MR) imaging and sparsely-sampled transrectal ultrasound\n(TRUS) images. The registration errors were 4.71 mm and 4.81 mm for complete\nTRUS imaging and sparsely-sampled TRUS imaging, respectively. The results\nindicate superior accuracy to the alternative rigid and non-rigid registration\nalgorithms tested and substantially lower computation time. The rapid inference\npossible with FPT makes it particularly suitable for applications where\nreal-time registration is beneficial.",

While labeling the samples by human experts is expensive and\ntime-consuming, collecting labels from crowd-sourcing suffers from the noises\nwhich may degenerate the accuracy of classifiers. Therefore, approaches that\ncan effectively handle label noises are highly desired. Unfortunately, recent\nprogress on handling label noise in deep learning has gone largely unnoticed by\nthe medical image. To fill the gap, this paper proposes a noise-tolerant\nmedical image classification framework named Co-Correcting, which significantly\nimproves classification accuracy and obtains more accurate labels through\ndual-network mutual learning, label probability estimation, and curriculum\nlabel correcting. On two representative medical image datasets and the MNIST\ndataset, we test six latest Learning-with-Noisy-Labels methods and conduct\ncomparative studies. The experiments show that Co-Correcting achieves the best\naccuracy and generalization under different noise ratios in various tasks.

The previously proposed\nmethods for LATE estimation required all relevant variables to be jointly\nobserved in a single dataset; however, it is sometimes difficult or even\nimpossible to collect such data in many real-world problems for technical or\nprivacy reasons. We consider a novel problem setting in which LATE, as a\nfunction of covariates, is nonparametrically identified from the combination of\nseparately observed datasets. For estimation, we show that the direct least\nsquares method, which was originally developed for estimating the average\ntreatment effect under complete compliance, is applicable to our setting.\nHowever, model selection and hyperparameter tuning for the direct least squares\nestimator can be unstable in practice since it is defined as a solution to the\nminimax problem. We then propose a weighted least squares estimator that\nenables simpler model selection by avoiding the minimax objective formulation.\nUnlike the inverse probability weighted (IPW) estimator, the proposed estimator\ndirectly uses the pre-estimated weight without inversion, avoiding the problems\ncaused by the IPW methods.

    "abstract": "The scoliosis progression in adolescents requires close monitoring to timely\ntake treatment measures. Ultrasound imaging is a radiation-free and low-cost\nalternative in scoliosis assessment to X-rays, which are typically used in\nclinical practice. However, ultrasound images are prone to speckle noises,\nmaking it challenging for sonographers to detect bony features and follow the\nspine's curvature. This paper introduces a robotic-ultrasound approach for\nspinal curvature tracking and automatic navigation. A fully connected network\nwith deconvolutional heads is developed to locate the spinous process\nefficiently with real-time ultrasound images. We use this machine\nlearning-based method to guide the motion of the robot-held ultrasound probe\nand follow the spinal curvature while capturing ultrasound images and\ncorrespondent position. We developed a new force-driven controller that\nautomatically adjusts the probe's pose relative to the skin surface to ensure a\ngood acoustic coupling between the probe and skin. After the scanning, the\nacquired data is used to reconstruct the coronal spinal image, where the\ndeformity of the scoliosis spine can be assessed and measured. To evaluate the\nperformance of our methodology, we conducted an experimental study with human\nsubjects where the deviations from the image center during the robotized\nprocedure are compared to that obtained from manual scanning. The angles of\nspinal deformity measured on spinal reconstruction images were similar for both\nmethods, implying that they equally reflect human anatomy.",

Here, we introduce two modified mesh\narchitectures that overcome this limitation: (1) a 3-splitter MZI for generic\nerrors, and (2) a broadband MZI+Crossing design for correlated errors. Because\nthese designs allow for perfect realization of the cross state, the matrix\nfidelity no longer decreases with mesh size, allowing scaling to arbitrarily\nlarge meshes. The proposed architectures support progressive\nself-configuration, are more compact than previous MZI-doubling schemes, and do\nnot require additional phase shifters. This eliminates a major obstacle to the\ndevelopment of very-large-scale linear photonic circuits.",

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a severe genetic hemoglobin disorder that\nresults in premature destruction of red blood cells. Assessment of the severity\nof the disease is a challenging task in clinical routine since the causes of\nbroad variance in SCD manifestation despite the common genetic cause remain\nunclear. Identification of the biomarkers that would predict the severity grade\nis of importance for prognosis and assessment of responsiveness of patients to\ntherapy. Detection of the changes in red blood cell (RBC) density through\nseparation of Percoll density gradient could be such marker as it allows to\nresolve intercellular differences and follow the most damaged dense cells prone\nto destruction and vaso-occlusion. Quantification of the images obtained from\nthe distribution of RBCs in Percoll gradient and interpretation of the obtained\nis an important prerequisite for establishment of this approach. Here, we\npropose a novel approach combining a graph convolutional network, a\nconvolutional neural network, fast Fourier transform, and recursive feature\nelimination to predict the severity of SCD directly from a Percoll image. Two\nimportant but expensive laboratory blood test parameters measurements are used\nfor training the graph convolutional network. To make the model independent\nfrom such tests during prediction, the two parameters are estimated by a neural\nnetwork from the Percoll image directly. On a cohort of 216 subjects, we\nachieve a prediction performance that is only slightly below an approach where\nthe groundtruth laboratory measurements are used. Our proposed method is the\nfirst computational approach for the difficult task of SCD severity prediction.\nThe two-step approach relies solely on inexpensive and simple blood analysis\ntools and can have a significant impact on the patients' survival in\nunderdeveloped countries where access to medical instruments and doctors is\nlimited",

Although group testing can help to\nsignificantly increase testing capabilities, the (repeated) testing of entire\npopulations can exceed the resources of any country. We thus propose an\nextension of the theory of group testing that takes into account the fact that\ndefinitely specifying the infection status of each individual is impossible.\nOur theory builds on assigning to each individual an infection status\n(healthy/infected), as well as an associated cost function for erroneous\nassignments. This cost function is versatile, e.g., it could take into account\nthat false negative assignments are worse than false positive assignments and\nthat false assignments in critical areas, such as health care workers, are more\nsevere than in the general population. Based on this model, we study the\noptimal use of a limited number of tests to minimize the expected cost. More\nspecifically, we utilize information-theoretic methods to give a lower bound on\nthe expected cost and describe simple strategies that can significantly reduce\nthe expected cost over currently known strategies. A detailed example is\nprovided to illustrate our theory.",

    "abstract": "Direct automatic segmentation of objects from 3D medical imaging, such as\nmagnetic resonance (MR) imaging, is challenging as it often involves accurately\nidentifying a number of individual objects with complex geometries within a\nlarge volume under investigation. To address these challenges, most deep\nlearning approaches typically enhance their learning capability by\nsubstantially increasing the complexity or the number of trainable parameters\nwithin their models. Consequently, these models generally require long\ninference time on standard workstations operating clinical MR systems and are\nrestricted to high-performance computing hardware due to their large memory\nrequirement. Further, to fit 3D dataset through these large models using\nlimited computer memory, trade-off techniques such as patch-wise training are\noften used which sacrifice the fine-scale geometric information from input\nimages which could be clinically significant for diagnostic purposes. To\naddress these challenges, we present a compact convolutional neural network\nwith a shallow memory footprint to efficiently reduce the number of model\nparameters required for state-of-art performance. This is critical for\npractical employment as most clinical environments only have low-end hardware\nwith limited computing power and memory. The proposed network can maintain data\nintegrity by directly processing large full-size 3D input volumes with no\npatches required and significantly reduces the computational time required for\nboth training and inference. We also propose a novel loss function with extra\nshape constraint to improve the accuracy for imbalanced classes in 3D MR\nimages.",

Second, we prove\nthat the core of a matching market with middlemen is always non-empty. Third,\nwe show the existence of a buyer-optimal core allocation and a seller-optimal\ncore allocation.

The spatial attention mechanism better\nreconstructs high-frequency features, and the channel attention mechanism\ntreats the features of different channels differently. Multi-branch structure\ndramatically improves the representation ability of the model and can be\nchanged into a single path structure after re-parameterization to speed up the\nprocess of inference. Local Residual Connection allows the low-frequency\ninformation in the nonhomogeneous area to pass through the block without\nprocessing so that the block can focus on detailed features. 2) A lightweight\nnetwork structure. We use cascaded MA blocks to extract high-frequency features\nstep by step, and the Multi-layer attention fusion tail combines the shallow\nand deep features of the model to get the residual of the clean image finally.\n3)We propose two novel loss functions to help reconstruct the hazy image\nColorAttenuation loss and Laplace Pyramid loss.

For practical link scheduling schemes, centralized and distributed\ngreedy heuristics are commonly used to approximate the solution to the MWIS\nproblem. However, these greedy schemes mostly ignore important topological\ninformation of the wireless network. To overcome this limitation, we propose\nfast heuristics based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs) that can be\nimplemented in centralized and distributed manners. Our centralized MWIS solver\nis based on tree search guided by a trainable GCN module and 1-step rollout. In\nour distributed MWIS solver, a trainable GCN module learns topology-aware node\nembeddings that are combined with the network weights before calling a\ndistributed greedy solver. Test results on medium-sized wireless networks show\nthat a GCN-based centralized MWIS solver can reach a near-optimal solution\nquickly. Moreover, we demonstrate that a shallow GCN-based distributed MWIS\nscheduler can reduce by nearly half the suboptimality gap of the distributed\ngreedy solver with minimal increase in complexity.

Differentiating between the two dementia types is crucial\nfor determining disease-specific intervention and treatment. Recent development\nof Deep-learning-based approaches in the field of medical image computing are\ndelivering some of the best performance for many binary classification tasks,\nalthough its application in differential diagnosis, such as neuroimage-based\ndifferentiation for multiple types of dementia, has not been explored. In this\nstudy, a novel framework was proposed by using the Generative Adversarial\nNetwork technique to distinguish FTD, AD and normal control subjects, using\nvolumetric features extracted at coarse-to-fine structural scales from Magnetic\nResonance Imaging scans. Experiments of 10-folds cross-validation on 1,954\nimages achieved high accuracy. With the proposed framework, we have\ndemonstrated that the combination of multi-scale structural features and\nsynthetic data augmentation based on generative adversarial network can improve\nthe performance of challenging tasks such as differentiating Dementia\nsub-types.",

The Wasserstein GAN (WGAN)\nleverages the Wasserstein distance to avoid the caveats in the minmax\ntwo-player training of GANs but has other defects such as mode collapse and\nlack of metric to detect the convergence. We introduce a novel inferential\nWasserstein GAN (iWGAN) model, which is a principled framework to fuse\nauto-encoders and WGANs. The iWGAN model jointly learns an encoder network and\na generator network motivated by the iterative primal dual optimization\nprocess.

We further provide a rigorous probabilistic\ninterpretation of our model under the framework of maximum likelihood\nestimation. The iWGAN, with a clear stopping criteria, has many advantages over\nother autoencoder GANs. The empirical experiments show that the iWGAN greatly\nmitigates the symptom of mode collapse, speeds up the convergence, and is able\nto provide a measurement of quality check for each individual sample.

The\nsTIL% score is a prognostic and predictive biomarker for many solid tumor\ntypes. However, due to the high labeling efforts and high intra- and\ninterobserver variability within and between expert annotators, this biomarker\nis currently not used in routine clinical decision making. WeakSTIL compresses\ntiles of a WSI using a feature extractor pre-trained with self-supervised\nlearning on unlabeled histopathology data and learns to predict precise sTIL%\nscores for each tile in the tumor bed by using a multiple instance learning\nregressor that only requires a weak WSI-level label. By requiring only a weak\nlabel, we overcome the large annotation efforts required to train currently\nexisting TIL detection methods. We show that WeakSTIL is at least as good as\nother TIL detection methods when predicting the WSI-level sTIL% score, reaching\na coefficient of determination of $0.45\\pm0.15$ when compared to scores\ngenerated by an expert pathologist, and an AUC of $0.89\\pm0.05$ when treating\nit as the clinically interesting sTIL-high vs sTIL-low classification task.\nAdditionally, we show that the intermediate tile-level predictions of WeakSTIL\nare highly interpretable, which suggests that WeakSTIL pays attention to latent\nfeatures related to the number of TILs and the tissue type.

    "abstract": "Despite many studies on the transmission mechanism of the Severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), it remains still challenging\nto efficiently reduce mortality. In this work, we apply a two-population\nSusceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model to investigate the COVID-19 spreading\nwhen contacts between elderly and non-elderly individuals are reduced due to\nthe high mortality risk of elderly people. We discover that the reduction of\nconnections between two populations can delay the death curve but cannot well\nreduce the final mortality. We propose a merged SIR model, which advises\nelderly individuals to interact less with their non-elderly connections at the\ninitial stage but interact more with their non-elderly relationships later, to\nreduce the final mortality. Finally, immunizing elderly hub individuals can\nalso significantly decrease mortality.",

    "title": "Studying squeeze-and-excitation used in CNN for speaker verification",
    "abstract": "In speaker verification, the extraction of voice representations is mainly\nbased on the Residual Neural Network (ResNet) architecture. ResNet is built\nupon convolution layers which learn filters to capture local spatial patterns\nalong all the input, then generate feature maps that jointly encode the spatial\nand channel information. Unfortunately, all feature maps in a convolution layer\nare learnt independently (the convolution layer does not exploit the\ndependencies between feature maps) and locally. This problem has first been\ntackled in image processing. A channel attention mechanism, called\nsqueeze-and-excitation (SE), has recently been proposed in convolution layers\nand applied to speaker verification. This mechanism re-weights the information\nextracted across features maps. In this paper, we first propose an original\nqualitative study about the influence and the role of the SE mechanism applied\nto the speaker verification task at different stages of the ResNet, and then\nevaluate several SE architectures. We finally propose to improve the SE\napproach with a new pool- ing variant based on the concatenation of mean- and\nstandard- deviation-pooling. Results showed that applying SE only on the first\nstages of the ResNet allows to better capture speaker information for the\nverification task, and that significant discrimination gains on Voxceleb1-E,\nVoxceleb1-H and SITW evaluation tasks have been noted using the proposed\npooling variant.",

The inequality lies between the classical\nlogarithmic Sobolev inequality and the modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality,\nroughly interpolating between the two as the size of the blocks grows. Our\nresults suggest that the new inequality may have some advantages with respect\nto the latter well known inequalities when multi-particle processes are\nconsidered. We prove a strong form of tensorization for independent particles\ninteracting through synchronous updates. Moreover, for block dynamics on\npermutations we compute the optimal constants in all mean field settings,\nnamely whenever the rate of update of a block depends only on the size of the\nblock. Along the way we establish the independence of the spectral gap on the\nnumber of particles for these mean field processes. As an application of our\nentropy inequalities we prove a new subadditivity estimate for permutations,\nwhich implies a sharp upper bound on the permanent of arbitrary matrices with\nnonnegative entries, thus resolving a well known conjecture.",

    "abstract": "The decoding of brain signals recorded via, e.g., an electroencephalogram,\nusing machine learning is key to brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Stimulation\nparameters or other experimental settings of the BCI protocol typically are\nchosen according to the literature. The decoding performance directly depends\non the choice of parameters, as they influence the elicited brain signals and\noptimal parameters are subject-dependent. Thus a fast and automated selection\nprocedure for experimental parameters could greatly improve the usability of\nBCIs.\nWe evaluate a standalone random search and a combined Bayesian optimization\nwith random search in a closed-loop auditory event-related potential protocol.\nWe aimed at finding the individually best stimulation speed -- also known as\nstimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) -- that maximizes the classification\nperformance of a regularized linear discriminant analysis. To make the Bayesian\noptimization feasible under noise and the time pressure posed by an online BCI\nexperiment, we first used offline simulations to initialize and constrain the\ninternal optimization model. Then we evaluated our approach online with 13\nhealthy subjects.\nWe could show that for 8 out of 13 subjects, the proposed approach using\nBayesian optimization succeeded to select the individually optimal SOA out of\nmultiple evaluated SOA values. Our data suggests, however, that subjects were\ninfluenced to very different degrees by the SOA parameter. This makes the\nautomatic parameter selection infeasible for subjects where the influence is\nlimited.\nOur work proposes an approach to exploit the benefits of individualized\nexperimental protocols and evaluated it in an auditory BCI. When applied to\nother experimental parameters our approach could enhance the usability of BCI\nfor different target groups -- specifically if an individual disease progress\nmay prevent the use of standard parameters.",

    "abstract": "In micro-fluidics not only does capillarity dominate but also thermal\nfluctuations become important. On the level of the lubrication approximation,\nthis leads to a quasi-linear fourth-order parabolic equation for the film\nheight $h$ driven by space-time white noise. The gradient flow structure of its\ndeterministic counterpart, the thin-film equation, which encodes the balance\nbetween driving capillary and limiting viscous forces, provides the guidance\nfor the thermodynamically consistent introduction of fluctuations. We follow\nthis route on the level of a spatial discretization of the gradient flow\nstructure. Starting from an energetically conformal finite-element (FE)\ndiscretization, we point out that the numerical mobility function introduced by\nGr\\\"un and Rumpf can be interpreted as a discretization of the metric tensor in\nthe sense of a mixed FE method with lumping. While this discretization was\ndevised in order to preserve the so-called entropy estimate, we use this to\nshow that the resulting high-dimensional stochastic differential equation (SDE)\npreserves pathwise and pointwise strict positivity, at least in case of the\nphysically relevant mobility function arising from the no-slip boundary\ncondition. As a consequence, this discretization gives rise to a consistent\ninvariant measure, namely a discretization of the Brownian excursion (up to the\nvolume constraint), and thus features an entropic repulsion. The price to pay\nover more naive discretizations is that when writing the SDE in It\\^o's form,\nwhich is the basis for the Euler-Mayurama time discretization, a correction\nterm appears. To conclude, we perform various numerical experiments to compare\nthe behavior of our discretization to that of the more naive finite difference\ndiscretization of the equation.",
