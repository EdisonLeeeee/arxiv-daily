    "abstract": "Using smart wearable devices to monitor patients electrocardiogram (ECG) for\nreal-time detection of arrhythmias can significantly improve healthcare\noutcomes. Convolutional neural network (CNN) based deep learning has been used\nsuccessfully to detect anomalous beats in ECG. However, the computational\ncomplexity of existing CNN models prohibits them from being implemented in\nlow-powered edge devices. Usually, such models are complex with lots of model\nparameters which results in large number of computations, memory, and power\nusage in edge devices. Network pruning techniques can reduce model complexity\nat the expense of performance in CNN models. This paper presents a novel\nmultistage pruning technique that reduces CNN model complexity with negligible\nloss in performance compared to existing pruning techniques. An existing CNN\nmodel for ECG classification is used as a baseline reference. At 60% sparsity,\nthe proposed technique achieves 97.7% accuracy and an F1 score of 93.59% for\nECG classification tasks. This is an improvement of 3.3% and 9% for accuracy\nand F1 Score respectively, compared to traditional pruning with fine-tuning\napproach. Compared to the baseline model, we also achieve a 60.4% decrease in\nrun-time complexity.",

    "title": "The Role of Explainability in Assuring Safety of Machine Learning in  Healthcare",
    "abstract": "Established approaches to assuring safety-critical systems and software are\ndifficult to apply to systems employing machine learning (ML). In many cases,\nML is used on ill-defined problems, e.g. optimising sepsis treatment, where\nthere is no clear, pre-defined specification against which to assess validity.\nThis problem is exacerbated by the \"opaque\" nature of ML where the learnt model\nis not amenable to human scrutiny. Explainable AI methods have been proposed to\ntackle this issue by producing human-interpretable representations of ML models\nwhich can help users to gain confidence and build trust in the ML system.\nHowever, there is not much work explicitly investigating the role of\nexplainability for safety assurance in the context of ML development. This\npaper identifies ways in which explainable AI methods can contribute to safety\nassurance of ML-based systems. It then uses a concrete ML-based clinical\ndecision support system, concerning weaning of patients from mechanical\nventilation, to demonstrate how explainable AI methods can be employed to\nproduce evidence to support safety assurance. The results are also represented\nin a safety argument to show where, and in what way, explainable AI methods can\ncontribute to a safety case. Overall, we conclude that explainable AI methods\nhave a valuable role in safety assurance of ML-based systems in healthcare but\nthat they are not sufficient in themselves to assure safety.",

    "abstract": "Existing techniques for mitigating dataset bias often leverage a biased model\nto identify biased instances. The role of these biased instances is then\nreduced during the training of the main model to enhance its robustness to\nout-of-distribution data. A common core assumption of these techniques is that\nthe main model handles biased instances similarly to the biased model, in that\nit will resort to biases whenever available. In this paper, we show that this\nassumption does not hold in general. We carry out a critical investigation on\ntwo well-known datasets in the domain, MNLI and FEVER, along with two biased\ninstance detection methods, partial-input and limited-capacity models. Our\nexperiments show that in around a third to a half of instances, the biased\nmodel is unable to predict the main model's behavior, highlighted by the\nsignificantly different parts of the input on which they base their decisions.\nBased on a manual validation, we also show that this estimate is highly in line\nwith human interpretation. Our findings suggest that down-weighting of\ninstances detected by bias detection methods, which is a widely-practiced\nprocedure, is an unnecessary waste of training data. We release our code to\nfacilitate reproducibility and future research.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of media streaming, video action recognition has become\nprogressively important for various applications, yet at the high expense of\nrequiring large-scale data labelling. To overcome the problem of expensive data\nlabelling, domain adaptation techniques have been proposed that transfers\nknowledge from fully labelled data (i.e., source domain) to unlabelled data\n(i.e., target domain). The majority of video domain adaptation algorithms are\nproposed for closed-set scenarios in which all the classes are shared among the\ndomains. In this work, we propose an open-set video domain adaptation approach\nto mitigate the domain discrepancy between the source and target data, allowing\nthe target data to contain additional classes that do not belong to the source\ndomain. Different from previous works, which only focus on improving accuracy\nfor shared classes, we aim to jointly enhance the alignment of shared classes\nand recognition of unknown samples. Towards this goal, class-conditional\nextreme value theory is applied to enhance the unknown recognition.\nSpecifically, the entropy values of target samples are modelled as generalised\nextreme value distributions, which allows separating unknown samples lying in\nthe tail of the distribution. To alleviate the negative transfer issue, weights\ncomputed by the distance from the sample entropy to the threshold are leveraged\nin adversarial learning in the sense that confident source and target samples\nare aligned, and unconfident samples are pushed away. The proposed method has\nbeen thoroughly evaluated on both small-scale and large-scale cross-domain\nvideo datasets and achieved the state-of-the-art performance.",

Besides, the number of editing operations is limited in the\nprevious methods, which decreases the diversity of the augmented data and thus\nrestricts the performance gain.

    "abstract": "The powerful learning ability of deep neural networks enables reinforcement\nlearning (RL) agents to learn competent control policies directly from\nhigh-dimensional and continuous environments. In theory, to achieve stable\nperformance, neural networks assume i.i.d. inputs, which unfortunately does no\nhold in the general RL paradigm where the training data is temporally\ncorrelated and non-stationary. This issue may lead to the phenomenon of\n\"catastrophic interference\" and the collapse in performance as later training\nis likely to overwrite and interfer with previously learned policies. In this\npaper, we introduce the concept of \"context\" into single-task RL and develop a\nnovel scheme, termed as Context Division and Knowledge Distillation (CDaKD)\ndriven RL, to divide all states experienced during training into a series of\ncontexts. Its motivation is to mitigate the challenge of aforementioned\ncatastrophic interference in deep RL, thereby improving the stability and\nplasticity of RL models. At the heart of CDaKD is a value function,\nparameterized by a neural network feature extractor shared across all contexts,\nand a set of output heads, each specializing on an individual context. In\nCDaKD, we exploit online clustering to achieve context division, and\ninterference is further alleviated by a knowledge distillation regularization\nterm on the output layers for learned contexts. In addition, to effectively\nobtain the context division in high-dimensional state spaces (e.g., image\ninputs), we perform clustering in the lower-dimensional representation space of\na randomly initialized convolutional encoder, which is fixed throughout\ntraining. Our results show that, with various replay memory capacities, CDaKD\ncan consistently improve the performance of existing RL algorithms on classic\nOpenAI Gym tasks and the more complex high-dimensional Atari tasks, incurring\nonly moderate computational overhead.",

    "abstract": "Wasserstein GANs with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) are an extremely popular\nmethod for training generative models to produce high quality synthetic data.\nWhile WGAN-GP were initially developed to calculate the Wasserstein 1 distance\nbetween generated and real data, recent works (e.g. Stanczuk et al. (2021))\nhave provided empirical evidence that this does not occur, and have argued that\nWGAN-GP perform well not in spite of this issue, but because of it. In this\npaper we show for the first time that WGAN-GP compute the minimum of a\ndifferent optimal transport problem, the so-called congested transport (Carlier\net al. (2008)). Congested transport determines the cost of moving one\ndistribution to another under a transport model that penalizes congestion. For\nWGAN-GP, we find that the congestion penalty has a spatially varying component\ndetermined by the sampling strategy used in Gulrajani et al. (2017) which acts\nlike a local speed limit, making congestion cost less in some regions than\nothers. This aspect of the congested transport problem is new in that the\ncongestion penalty turns out to be unbounded and depend on the distributions to\nbe transported, and so we provide the necessary mathematical proofs for this\nsetting. We use our discovery to show that the gradients of solutions to the\noptimization problem in WGAN-GP determine the time averaged momentum of optimal\nmass flow. This is in contrast to the gradients of Kantorovich potentials for\nthe Wasserstein 1 distance, which only determine the normalized direction of\nflow. This may explain, in support of Stanczuk et al. (2021), the success of\nWGAN-GP, since the training of the generator is based on these gradients.",

Supervised Machine\nLearning based Regression algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, and\nGradient Boosting Algorithm were used. The results showed that the Random\nForest algorithm yielded highest coefficient of determination value of 0.926\nwhich means it gives a best fit in comparison to other algorithms.",

    "title": "DILBERT: Customized Pre-Training for Domain Adaptation withCategory  Shift, with an Application to Aspect Extraction",
    "abstract": "The rise of pre-trained language models has yielded substantial progress in\nthe vast majority of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, a\ngeneric approach towards the pre-training procedure can naturally be\nsub-optimal in some cases. Particularly, fine-tuning a pre-trained language\nmodel on a source domain and then applying it to a different target domain,\nresults in a sharp performance decline of the eventual classifier for many\nsource-target domain pairs. Moreover, in some NLP tasks, the output categories\nsubstantially differ between domains, making adaptation even more challenging.\nThis, for example, happens in the task of aspect extraction, where the aspects\nof interest of reviews of, e.g., restaurants or electronic devices may be very\ndifferent. This paper presents a new fine-tuning scheme for BERT, which aims to\naddress the above challenges. We name this scheme DILBERT: Domain Invariant\nLearning with BERT, and customize it for aspect extraction in the unsupervised\ndomain adaptation setting. DILBERT harnesses the categorical information of\nboth the source and the target domains to guide the pre-training process\ntowards a more domain and category invariant representation, thus closing the\ngap between the domains. We show that DILBERT yields substantial improvements\nover state-of-the-art baselines while using a fraction of the unlabeled data,\nparticularly in more challenging domain adaptation setups.",

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are now being widely used for classifying\nand detecting pulmonary abnormalities in chest radiographs. Two complementary\ngeneralization properties of CNNs, translation invariance and equivariance, are\nparticularly useful in detecting manifested abnormalities associated with\npulmonary disease, regardless of their spatial locations within the image.\nHowever, these properties also come with the loss of exact spatial information\nand global relative positions of abnormalities detected in local regions.\nGlobal relative positions of such abnormalities may help distinguish similar\nconditions, such as COVID-19 and viral pneumonia. In such instances, a global\nattention mechanism is needed, which CNNs do not support in their traditional\narchitectures that aim for generalization afforded by translation invariance\nand equivariance. Vision Transformers provide a global attention mechanism, but\nlack translation invariance and equivariance, requiring significantly more\ntraining data samples to match generalization of CNNs. To address the loss of\nspatial information and global relations between features, while preserving the\ninductive biases of CNNs, we present a novel technique that serves as an\nauxiliary attention mechanism to existing CNN architectures, in order to\nextract global correlations between salient features.",

    "abstract": "Many segmentation tasks for biomedical images can be modeled as the\nminimization of an energy function and solved by a class of max-flow and\nmin-cut optimization algorithms. However, the segmentation accuracy is\nsensitive to the contrasting of semantic features of different segmenting\nobjects, as the traditional energy function usually uses hand-crafted features\nin their energy functions. To address these limitations, we propose to\nincorporate end-to-end trainable neural network features into the energy\nfunctions. Our deep neural network features are extracted from the\ndown-sampling and up-sampling layers with skip-connections of a U-net. In the\ninference stage, the learned features are fed into the energy functions. And\nthe segmentations are solved in a primal-dual form by ADMM solvers. In the\ntraining stage, we train our neural networks by optimizing the energy function\nin the primal form with regularizations on the min-cut and flow-conservation\nfunctions, which are derived from the optimal conditions in the dual form. We\nevaluate our methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in a brain tumor\nsegmentation task. As the energy minimization model achieves a balance on\nsensitivity and smooth boundaries, we would show how our segmentation contours\nevolve actively through iterations as ensemble references for doctor diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "There is a significant expansion in both volume and range of applications\nalong with the concomitant increase in the variety of data sources. These\never-expanding trends have highlighted the necessity for more versatile\nanalysis tools that offer greater opportunities for algorithmic developments\nand computationally faster operations than the standard flat-view matrix\napproach. Tensors, or multi-way arrays, provide such an algebraic framework\nwhich is naturally suited to data of such large volume, diversity, and\nveracity. Indeed, the associated tensor decompositions have demonstrated their\npotential in breaking the Curse of Dimensionality associated with traditional\nmatrix methods, where a necessary exponential increase in data volume leads to\nadverse or even intractable consequences on computational complexity. A key\ntool underpinning multi-linear manipulation of tensors and tensor networks is\nthe standard Tensor Contraction Product (TCP). However, depending on the\ndimensionality of the underlying tensors, the TCP also comes at the price of\nhigh computational complexity in tensor manipulation. In this work, we resort\nto diagrammatic tensor network manipulation to calculate such products in an\nefficient and computationally tractable manner, by making use of Tensor Train\ndecomposition (TTD). This has rendered the underlying concepts easy to\nperceive, thereby enhancing intuition of the associated underlying operations,\nwhile preserving mathematical rigour. In addition to bypassing the cumbersome\nmathematical multi-linear expressions, the proposed Tensor Train Contraction\nProduct model is shown to accelerate significantly the underlying computational\noperations, as it is independent of tensor order and linear in the tensor\ndimension, as opposed to performing the full computations through the standard\napproach (exponential in tensor order).",

    "abstract": "Cough is a major symptom of respiratory-related diseases. There exists a\ntremendous amount of work in detecting coughs from audio but there has been no\neffort to identify coughs from solely inertial measurement unit (IMU). Coughing\ncauses motion across the whole body and especially on the neck and head.\nTherefore, head motion data during coughing captured by a head-worn IMU sensor\ncould be leveraged to detect coughs using a template matching algorithm. In\ntime series template matching problems, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) combined with\nelastic distance measurement (esp. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)) achieves\noutstanding performance. However, it is often regarded as prohibitively\ntime-consuming. Nearest Centroid Classifier is thereafter proposed. But the\naccuracy is comprised of only one centroid obtained for each class.\nCentroid-based Classifier performs clustering and averaging for each cluster,\nbut requires manually setting the number of clusters. We propose a novel\nself-tuning multi-centroid template-matching algorithm, which can automatically\nadjust the number of clusters to balance accuracy and inference time.

To this\nend, we propose to incorporate two techniques and present ViT-ResNAS, an\nefficient multi-stage ViT architecture designed with neural architecture search\n(NAS). First, we propose residual spatial reduction to decrease sequence\nlengths for deeper layers and utilize a multi-stage architecture.

To efficiently train the super-network, we\npropose to sample and train multiple sub-networks with one forward-backward\npass. After that, evolutionary search is performed to discover high-performance\nnetwork architectures. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that ViT-ResNAS\nachieves better accuracy-MACs and accuracy-throughput trade-offs than the\noriginal DeiT and other strong baselines of ViT.

Transmission\nand centralized storage technologies can help, but are costly. An alternative\nto centralized storage is to make better use of shiftable demand, but it is\nunclear how much shiftable demand exists. A significant share of electricity\ndemand is used for cooling and heating, and low-cost technologies exists to\nshift these loads. With sufficient insulation, energy used for air conditioning\nand space heating can be stored in ice or hot water from hours to days. In this\nstudy, we combine regional hourly demand with fine-grained weather data across\nthe United States to estimate temperature-sensitive demand, and how much demand\nvariability can be reduced by shifting temperature-sensitive loads within each\nday, with and without improved transmission. We find that approximately three\nquarters of within-day demand variability can be eliminated by shifting only\nhalf of temperature-sensitive demand.

In this work we develop a simple yet powerful framework,\nwhose key idea is to select a subset of training examples from the unlabeled\ndata when performing existing SSL methods so that only the unlabeled examples\nwith pseudo labels related to the labeled data will be used to train models.\nThe selection is performed at each updating iteration by only keeping the\nexamples whose losses are smaller than a given threshold that is dynamically\nadjusted through the iteration. Our proposed approach, Dash, enjoys its\nadaptivity in terms of unlabeled data selection and its theoretical guarantee.\nSpecifically, we theoretically establish the convergence rate of Dash from the\nview of non-convex optimization. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with state-of-the-art over\nbenchmarks.",

    "title": "Cut-Toggling and Cycle-Toggling for Electrical Flow and Other p-Norm  Flows",
    "abstract": "We study the problem of finding flows in undirected graphs so as to minimize\nthe weighted $p$-norm of the flow for any $p > 1$. When $p=2$, the problem is\nthat of finding an electrical flow, and its dual is equivalent to solving a\nLaplacian linear system. The case $p = \\infty$ corresponds to finding a\nmin-congestion flow, which is equivalent to max-flows. A typical algorithmic\nconstruction for such problems considers vertex potentials corresponding to the\nflow conservation constraints, and has two simple types of update steps: cycle\ntoggling, which modifies the flow along a cycle, and cut toggling, which\nmodifies all potentials on one side of a cut. Both types of steps are typically\nperformed relative to a spanning tree $T$; then the cycle is a fundamental\ncycle of $T$, and the cut is a fundamental cut of $T$. In this paper, we show\nthat these simple steps can be used to give a novel efficient implementation\nfor the $p = 2$ case and to find near-optimal $p$-norm flows in a low number of\niterations for all values of $p > 1$. Compared to known faster algorithms for\nthese problems, our algorithms are simpler, more combinatorial, and also expose\nseveral underlying connections between these algorithms and dynamic graph data\nstructures that have not been formalized previously.",

    "title": "Multi-Queues Can Be State-of-the-Art Priority Schedulers",
    "abstract": "Designing and implementing efficient parallel priority schedulers is an\nactive research area. An intriguing proposed design is the Multi-Queue: given\n$n$ threads and $m\\ge n$ distinct priority queues, task insertions are\nperformed uniformly at random, while, to delete, a thread picks two queues\nuniformly at random, and removes the observed task of higher priority. This\napproach scales well, and has probabilistic rank guarantees: roughly, the rank\nof each task removed, relative to remaining tasks in all other queues, is\n$O(m)$ in expectation. Yet, the performance of this pattern is below that of\nwell-engineered schedulers, which eschew theoretical guarantees for practical\nefficiency.\nWe investigate whether it is possible to design and implement a\nMulti-Queue-based task scheduler that is both highly efficient and has\nanalytical guarantees. We propose a new variant called the Stealing Multi-Queue\n(SMQ), a cache-efficient variant of the Multi-Queue, which leverages both queue\naffinity -- each thread has a local queue, from which tasks are usually\nremoved; but, with some probability, threads also attempt to steal\nhigher-priority tasks from the other queues -- and task batching, that is, the\nprocessing of several tasks in a single insert / delete step. These ideas are\nwell-known for task scheduling without priorities; our theoretical contribution\nis showing that, despite relaxations, this design can still provide rank\nguarantees, which in turn implies bounds on total work performed. We provide a\ngeneral SMQ implementation that can surpass state-of-the-art schedulers such as\nGalois and PMOD in terms of performance on popular graph-processing benchmarks.\nNotably, the performance improvement comes mainly from the superior rank\nguarantees provided by our scheduler, confirming that analytically-reasoned\napproaches can still provide performance improvements for priority task\nscheduling.",

    "abstract": "Software architectural changes involve more than one module or component and\nare complex to analyze compared to local code changes. Development teams aiming\nto review architectural aspects (design) of a change commit consider many\nessential scenarios such as access rules and restrictions on usage of program\nentities across modules. Moreover, design review is essential when proper\narchitectural formulations are paramount for developing and deploying a system.\nUntangling architectural changes, recovering semantic design, and producing\ndesign notes are the crucial tasks of the design review process. To support\nthese tasks, we construct a lightweight tool [4] that can detect and decompose\nsemantic slices of a commit containing architectural instances. A semantic\nslice consists of a description of relational information of involved modules,\ntheir classes, methods and connected modules in a change instance, which is\neasy to understand to a reviewer. We extract various directory and naming\nstructures (DANS) properties from the source code for developing our tool.\nUtilizing the DANS properties, our tool first detects architectural change\ninstances based on our defined metric and then decomposes the slices (based on\nstring processing). Our preliminary investigation with ten open-source projects\n(developed in Java and Kotlin) reveals that the DANS properties produce highly\nreliable precision and recall (93-100%) for detecting and generating\narchitectural slices. Our proposed tool will serve as the preliminary approach\nfor the semantic design recovery and design summary generation for the project\nreleases.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in deep learning have expanded possibilities to generate\nmusic, but generating a customizable full piece of music with consistent\nlong-term structure remains a challenge. This paper introduces MusicFrameworks,\na hierarchical music structure representation and a multi-step generative\nprocess to create a full-length melody guided by long-term repetitive\nstructure, chord, melodic contour, and rhythm constraints. We first organize\nthe full melody with section and phrase-level structure. To generate melody in\neach phrase, we generate rhythm and basic melody using two separate\ntransformer-based networks, and then generate the melody conditioned on the\nbasic melody, rhythm and chords in an auto-regressive manner. By factoring\nmusic generation into sub-problems, our approach allows simpler models and\nrequires less data. To customize or add variety, one can alter chords, basic\nmelody, and rhythm structure in the music frameworks, letting our networks\ngenerate the melody accordingly. Additionally, we introduce new features to\nencode musical positional information, rhythm patterns, and melodic contours\nbased on musical domain knowledge. A listening test reveals that melodies\ngenerated by our method are rated as good as or better than human-composed\nmusic in the POP909 dataset about half the time.",

In the\nsecond phase we modify the value function to add fairness constraint, and\ncontinue training the network to generate data that is both accurate and fair.\nWe test our results in both cases of unconstrained, and constrained fair data\ngeneration.

Together with the main chat translation task, we\noptimize the NCT model through the training objectives of all these tasks. By\nthis means, the NCT model can be enhanced by capturing the inherent dialogue\ncharacteristics, thus generating more coherent and speaker-relevant\ntranslations.

    "title": "Deep Face Video Inpainting via UV Mapping",
    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of face video inpainting. Existing video\ninpainting methods target primarily at natural scenes with repetitive patterns.\nThey do not make use of any prior knowledge of the face to help retrieve\ncorrespondences for the corrupted face. They therefore only achieve sub-optimal\nresults, particularly for faces under large pose and expression variations\nwhere face components appear very differently across frames. In this paper, we\npropose a two-stage deep learning method for face video inpainting. We employ\n3DMM as our 3D face prior to transform a face between the image space and the\nUV (texture) space. In Stage I, we perform face inpainting in the UV space.\nThis helps to largely remove the influence of face poses and expressions and\nmakes the learning task much easier with well aligned face features. We\nintroduce a frame-wise attention module to fully exploit correspondences in\nneighboring frames to assist the inpainting task. In Stage II, we transform the\ninpainted face regions back to the image space and perform face video\nrefinement that inpaints any background regions not covered in Stage I and also\nrefines the inpainted face regions. Extensive experiments have been carried out\nwhich show our method can significantly outperform methods based merely on 2D\ninformation, especially for faces under large pose and expression variations.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an improved global navigation satellite system (GNSS)\npositioning method that explores the time correlation between consecutive\nepochs of the code and carrier phase measurements which significantly increases\nthe robustness against outlier measurements. Instead of relying on the time\ndifference carrier phase (TDCP) which only considers two neighboring epochs\nusing an extended Kalman filter (EKF) estimator, this paper proposed to employ\nthe carrier-phase measurements inside a window, the so-called window\ncarrier-phase (WCP), to constrain the states inside a factor graph. A left null\nspace matrix is employed to eliminate the shared unknown ambiguity variables\nand therefore, correlated the associated states inside the WCP. Then the\npseudorange, Doppler, and the constructed WCP measurements are integrated\nsimultaneously using factor graph optimization (FGO) to estimate the state of\nthe GNSS receiver. We evaluated the performance of the proposed method in two\ntypical urban canyons in Hong Kong, achieving the mean positioning error of\n1.76 meters and 2.96 meters, respectively, using the automobile-level GNSS\nreceiver. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of the proposed method is further\nevaluated using a low-cost smartphone level GNSS receiver and similar\nimprovement is also obtained, compared with several existing GNSS positioning\nmethods.",

    "abstract": "A backdoor data poisoning attack is an adversarial attack wherein the\nattacker injects several watermarked, mislabeled training examples into a\ntraining set. The watermark does not impact the test-time performance of the\nmodel on typical data; however, the model reliably errs on watermarked\nexamples.\nTo gain a better foundational understanding of backdoor data poisoning\nattacks, we present a formal theoretical framework within which one can discuss\nbackdoor data poisoning attacks for classification problems. We then use this\nto analyze important statistical and computational issues surrounding these\nattacks.\nOn the statistical front, we identify a parameter we call the memorization\ncapacity that captures the intrinsic vulnerability of a learning problem to a\nbackdoor attack. This allows us to argue about the robustness of several\nnatural learning problems to backdoor attacks. Our results favoring the\nattacker involve presenting explicit constructions of backdoor attacks, and our\nrobustness results show that some natural problem settings cannot yield\nsuccessful backdoor attacks.\nFrom a computational standpoint, we show that under certain assumptions,\nadversarial training can detect the presence of backdoors in a training set. We\nthen show that under similar assumptions, two closely related problems we call\nbackdoor filtering and robust generalization are nearly equivalent. This\nimplies that it is both asymptotically necessary and sufficient to design\nalgorithms that can identify watermarked examples in the training set in order\nto obtain a learning algorithm that both generalizes well to unseen data and is\nrobust to backdoors.",

Targeting this, Neural Process Families\n(NPFs) have recently shone a light on prediction with uncertainties by bridging\nGaussian processes and neural networks. Latent neural process, a member of NPF,\nis believed to be capable of modelling the uncertainty on certain points (local\nuncertainty) as well as the general function priors (global uncertainties).\nNonetheless, some critical questions remain unresolved, such as a formal\ndefinition of global uncertainties, the causality behind global uncertainties,\nand the manipulation of global uncertainties for generative models. Regarding\nthis, we build a member GloBal Convolutional Neural Process(GBCoNP) that\nachieves the SOTA log-likelihood in latent NPFs. It designs a global\nuncertainty representation p(z), which is an aggregation on a discretized input\nspace. The causal effect between the degree of global uncertainty and the\nintra-task diversity is discussed. The learnt prior is analyzed on a variety of\nscenarios, including 1D, 2D, and a newly proposed spatial-temporal COVID\ndataset.

    "abstract": "Real-time semantic segmentation, which can be visually understood as the\npixel-level classification task on the input image, currently has broad\napplication prospects, especially in the fast-developing fields of autonomous\ndriving and drone navigation. However, the huge burden of calculation together\nwith redundant parameters are still the obstacles to its technological\ndevelopment. In this paper, we propose a Fast Bilateral Symmetrical Network\n(FBSNet) to alleviate the above challenges. Specifically, FBSNet employs a\nsymmetrical encoder-decoder structure with two branches, semantic information\nbranch, and spatial detail branch. The semantic information branch is the main\nbranch with deep network architecture to acquire the contextual information of\nthe input image and meanwhile acquire sufficient receptive field. While spatial\ndetail branch is a shallow and simple network used to establish local\ndependencies of each pixel for preserving details, which is essential for\nrestoring the original resolution during the decoding phase. Meanwhile, a\nfeature aggregation module (FAM) is designed to effectively combine the output\nfeatures of the two branches. The experimental results of Cityscapes and CamVid\nshow that the proposed FBSNet can strike a good balance between accuracy and\nefficiency. Specifically, it obtains 70.9\\% and 68.9\\% mIoU along with the\ninference speed of 90 fps and 120 fps on these two test datasets, respectively,\nwith only 0.62 million parameters on a single RTX 2080Ti GPU.",

In our\nprevious work \\cite{huang2021gradient}, we proposed an approach to learn the\ngradient of the unclosed high order moment, which performs much better than\nlearning the moment itself and the conventional $P_N$ closure. However, while\nthe ML moment closure has better accuracy, it is not able to guarantee\nhyperbolicity and has issues with long time stability. In our second paper\n\\cite{huang2021hyperbolic}, we identified a symmetrizer which leads to\nconditions that enforce that the gradient based ML closure is symmetrizable\nhyperbolic and stable over long time. The limitation of this approach is that\nin practice the highest moment can only be related to four, or fewer, lower\nmoments.\nIn this paper, we propose a new method to enforce the hyperbolicity of the ML\nclosure model. Motivated by the observation that the coefficient matrix of the\nclosure system is a lower Hessenberg matrix, we relate its eigenvalues to the\nroots of an associated polynomial. We design two new neural network\narchitectures based on this relation. The ML closure model resulting from the\nfirst neural network is weakly hyperbolic and guarantees the physical\ncharacteristic speeds, i.e., the eigenvalues are bounded by the speed of light.\nThe second model is strictly hyperbolic and does not guarantee the boundedness\nof the eigenvalues. Several benchmark tests including the Gaussian source\nproblem and the two-material problem show the good accuracy, stability and\ngeneralizability of our hyperbolic ML closure model.",

However, the sounds to which IDLMA is applied do not always have such\ntimbres, and the timbral mismatch causes the performance degradation of IDLMA.\nTo tackle this problem, we focus on a blind source separation counterpart of\nIDLMA, independent low-rank matrix analysis. It uses nonnegative matrix\nfactorization (NMF) as the source model, which can capture source spectral\ncomponents that only appear in the target mixture, using the low-rank structure\nof the source spectrogram as a clue. We thus extend the DNN-based source model\nto encompass the NMF-based source model on the basis of the product-of-expert\nconcept, which we call the product of source models (PoSM).

Existing transfer learning approaches for low-resource NER usually have\nthe challenge that the target domain has different label sets compared with a\nresource-rich source domain, which can be concluded as class transfer and\ndomain transfer problems. In this paper, we propose a lightweight generative\nframework with prompt-guided attention for low-resource NER (LightNER) to\naddress these issues. Concretely, instead of tackling the problem by training\nlabel-specific discriminative classifiers, we convert sequence labeling to\ngenerate the entity pointer index sequence and entity categories without any\nlabel-specific classifiers, which can address the class transfer issue. We\nfurther propose prompt-guided attention by incorporating continuous prompts\ninto the self-attention layer to re-modulate the attention and adapt\npre-trained weights. Note that we only tune those continuous prompts with the\nwhole parameter of the pre-trained language model fixed, thus, making our\napproach lightweight and flexible for low-resource scenarios and can better\ntransfer knowledge across domains. Experimental results show that by tuning\nonly 0.16% of the parameters, LightNER can obtain comparable performance in the\nstandard setting and outperform standard sequence labeling and prototype-based\nmethods in low-resource settings.",

    "abstract": "It is reported that the number of online payment users in China has reached\n854 million; with the emergence of community e-commerce platforms, the trend of\nintegration of e-commerce and social applications is increasingly intense.\nCommunity e-commerce is not a mature and sound comprehensive e-commerce with\nfewer categories and low brand value. To effectively retain community users and\nfully explore customer value has become an important challenge for community\ne-commerce operators. Given the above problems, this paper uses the data-driven\nmethod to study the prediction of community e-commerce customers' repurchase\nbehaviour. The main research contents include 1. Given the complex problem of\nfeature engineering, the classic model RFM in the field of customer\nrelationship management is improved, and an improved model is proposed to\ndescribe the characteristics of customer buying behaviour, which includes five\nindicators. 2. In view of the imbalance of machine learning training samples in\nSMOTE-ENN, a training sample balance using SMOTE-ENN is proposed. The\nexperimental results show that the machine learning model can be trained more\neffectively on balanced samples. 3. Aiming at the complexity of the parameter\nadjustment process, an automatic hyperparameter optimization method based on\nthe TPE method was proposed. Compared with other methods, the model's\nprediction performance is improved, and the training time is reduced by more\nthan 450%. 4. Aiming at the weak prediction ability of a single model, the soft\nvoting based RF-LightgBM model was proposed. The experimental results show that\nthe RF-LighTGBM model proposed in this paper can effectively predict customer\nrepurchase behaviour, and the F1 value is 0.859, which is better than the\nsingle model and previous research results.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental goal of scientific research is to learn about causal\nrelationships. However, despite its critical role in the life and social\nsciences, causality has not had the same importance in Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP), which has traditionally placed more emphasis on predictive\ntasks. This distinction is beginning to fade, with an emerging area of\ninterdisciplinary research at the convergence of causal inference and language\nprocessing. Still, research on causality in NLP remains scattered across\ndomains without unified definitions, benchmark datasets and clear articulations\nof the remaining challenges. In this survey, we consolidate research across\nacademic areas and situate it in the broader NLP landscape. We introduce the\nstatistical challenge of estimating causal effects, encompassing settings where\ntext is used as an outcome, treatment, or as a means to address confounding. In\naddition, we explore potential uses of causal inference to improve the\nperformance, robustness, fairness, and interpretability of NLP models. We thus\nprovide a unified overview of causal inference for the computational\nlinguistics community.",

One is maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference, i.e., to\nfind a principal submatrix having the maximum determinant. The other is\nprobabilistic inference on exponentiated DPPs (E-DPPs), which can sharpen or\nweaken the diversity preference of DPPs with an exponent parameter $p$. We\nprove the following complexity-theoretic hardness results that explain the\ndifficulty in approximating MAP inference and the normalizing constant for\nE-DPPs.\n1. Unconstrained MAP inference for an $n \\times n$ matrix is NP-hard to\napproximate within a factor of $2^{\\beta n}$, where $\\beta = 10^{-10^{13}} $.\nThis result improves upon a $(\\frac{9}{8}-\\epsilon)$-factor inapproximability\ngiven by Kulesza and Taskar (2012).\n2. Log-determinant maximization is NP-hard to approximate within a factor of\n$\\frac{5}{4}$ for the unconstrained case and within a factor of\n$1+10^{-10^{13}}$ for the size-constrained monotone case.\n3. The normalizing constant for E-DPPs of any (fixed) constant exponent $p\n\\geq \\beta^{-1} = 10^{10^{13}}$ is NP-hard to approximate within a factor of\n$2^{\\beta pn}$.

    "abstract": "Weighted automata are a generalization of nondeterministic automata that\nassociate a weight drawn from a semiring $K$ with every transition and every\nstate. Their behaviours can be formalized either as weighted language\nequivalence or weighted bisimulation. In this paper we explore the properties\nof weighted automata in the framework of coalgebras over (i) the category\n$\\mathsf{SMod}$ of semimodules over a semiring $K$ and $K$-linear maps, and\n(ii) the category $\\mathsf{Set}$ of sets and maps. We show that the behavioural\nequivalences defined by the corresponding final coalgebras in these two cases\ncharacterize weighted language equivalence and weighted bisimulation,\nrespectively. These results extend earlier work by Bonchi et al. using the\ncategory $\\mathsf{Vect}$ of vector spaces and linear maps as the underlying\nmodel for weighted automata with weights drawn from a field $K$. The key step\nin our work is generalizing the notions of linear relations and linear\nbisimulations of Boreale from vector spaces to semimodules using the concept of\nthe kernel of a $K$-linear map in the sense of universal algebra. We also\nprovide an abstract procedure for forward partition refinement for computing\nweighted language equivalence. Since for weighted automata defined over\nsemirings the problem is undecidable in general, it is guaranteed to halt only\nin special cases. Although the results are similar to those of Bonchi et al,\nmany of our proofs are new, especially for the coalgebra in $\\mathsf{SMod}$\ncharacterizing weighted language equivalence.",

There is an urgent need for effective and suitable\ncyber-security solutions for small businesses as they employ a significant\nproportion of the workforce.\nIn this paper, we consider the small business cyber-security challenges not\ncurrently addressed by research or products, contextualised via an Australian\nlens.

In particular, if $q$ is an odd prime power then\n$\\mathcal{H}_{a,b}(\\FF_q)$ is the semisimple non-commutative matrix ring\n$M_2(\\FF_q)$. Consequently, a homogeneous weight that depends on the field size\n$q$ is obtained.

This is illustrated by the quaternions over the Galois ring\n$GR(2^r,m)$. Finally, one-sided linear block codes over the quaternions over\nGalois rings are constructed, and certain bounds on the homogeneous distance of\nthe images of these codes are proved. These bounds are based on the Hamming\ndistance of the quaternion code and the parameters of the Galois ring.

Recent studies reveal that the key to this task lies\nwithin the effective representation learning of both news and users. Existing\nworks typically encode news title and content separately while neglecting their\nsemantic interaction, which is inadequate for news text comprehension.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks produce state-of-the-art results when trained on a large\nnumber of labeled examples but tend to overfit when small amounts of labeled\nexamples are used for training. Creating a large number of labeled examples\nrequires considerable resources, time, and effort. If labeling new data is not\nfeasible, so-called semi-supervised learning can achieve better generalisation\nthan purely supervised learning by employing unlabeled instances as well as\nlabeled ones. The work presented in this paper is motivated by the observation\nthat transfer learning provides the opportunity to potentially further improve\nperformance by exploiting models pretrained on a similar domain. More\nspecifically, we explore the use of transfer learning when performing\nsemi-supervised learning using self-learning. The main contribution is an\nempirical evaluation of transfer learning using different combinations of\nsimilarity metric learning methods and label propagation algorithms in\nsemi-supervised learning. We find that transfer learning always substantially\nimproves the model's accuracy when few labeled examples are available,\nregardless of the type of loss used for training the neural network.

In this paper, we\npursue the idea of building a neural network model that automatically estimates\nthe built years of Buddha statues based only on their face images. Our model\nuses a loss function that consists of three terms: an MSE loss that provides\nthe basis for built year estimation; a KL divergence-based loss that handles\nthe samples with both an exact built year and a possible range of built years\n(e.g., dynasty or centuries) estimated by historians; finally a regularisation\nthat utilises both labelled and unlabelled samples based on manifold\nassumption.

    "abstract": "The last decade has witnessed the emergence of magneto-active polymers (MAPs)\nas one of the most advanced multi-functional soft composites. Depending on the\nmagnetisation mechanisms and responsive behaviour, MAPs are mainly classified\ninto two groups: i) hard magnetic MAPs in which a large residual magnetic flux\ndensity sustains even after the removal of the external magnetic field, and ii)\nsoft magnetic MAPs where the magnetisation of the filler particles disappear\nupon the removal of the external magnetic field. Polymeric materials are widely\ntreated as fully incompressible solids that require special numerical treatment\nto solve the associated boundary value problem. Furthermore, both soft and hard\nmagnetic particles-filled soft polymers are inherently viscoelastic. Therefore,\nthe aim of this paper is to devise a unified finite element method-based\nnumerical framework for magneto-mechanically coupled systems that can work for\ncompressible and fully incompressible materials and from hard to soft MAPs,\nincluding the effects of the time-dependent viscoelastic behaviour of the\nunderlying matrix. First, variational formulations for the uncoupled problem\nfor hard MAPs and the coupled problem for soft MAPs are derived. The weak forms\nare then discretised with higher-order B\\'ezier elements while the evolution\nequation for internal variables in viscoelastic models is solved using the\ngeneralised-alpha time integration scheme, which is implicit and second-order\naccurate. Finally, a series of experimentally-driven boundary value problems\nconsisting of the beam and robotic gripper models are solved in\nmagneto-mechanically coupled settings, demonstrating the versatility of the\nproposed numerical framework. The effect of viscoelastic material parameters on\nthe response characteristics of MAPs under coupled magneto-mechanical loading\nis also studied.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous marine vehicles play an essential role in many ocean science and\nengineering applications. Planning time and energy optimal paths for these\nvehicles to navigate in stochastic dynamic ocean environments is essential to\nreduce operational costs. In some missions, they must also harvest solar, wind,\nor wave energy (modeled as a stochastic scalar field) and move in optimal paths\nthat minimize net energy consumption. Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) provide\na natural framework for sequential decision-making for robotic agents in such\nenvironments. However, building a realistic model and solving the modeled MDP\nbecomes computationally expensive in large-scale real-time applications,\nwarranting the need for parallel algorithms and efficient implementation. In\nthe present work, we introduce an efficient end-to-end GPU-accelerated\nalgorithm that (i) builds the MDP model (computing transition probabilities and\nexpected one-step rewards); and (ii) solves the MDP to compute an optimal\npolicy. We develop methodical and algorithmic solutions to overcome the limited\nglobal memory of GPUs by (i) using a dynamic reduced-order representation of\nthe ocean flows, (ii) leveraging the sparse nature of the state transition\nprobability matrix, (iii) introducing a neighbouring sub-grid concept and (iv)\nproving that it is sufficient to use only the stochastic scalar field's mean to\ncompute the expected one-step rewards for missions involving energy harvesting\nfrom the environment; thereby saving memory and reducing the computational\neffort. We demonstrate the algorithm on a simulated stochastic dynamic\nenvironment and highlight that it builds the MDP model and computes the optimal\npolicy 600-1000x faster than conventional CPU implementations, making it\nsuitable for real-time use.",

    "abstract": "Pre-trained models for Natural Languages (NL) like BERT and GPT have been\nrecently shown to transfer well to Programming Languages (PL) and largely\nbenefit a broad set of code-related tasks. Despite their success, most current\nmethods either rely on an encoder-only (or decoder-only) pre-training that is\nsuboptimal for generation (resp. understanding) tasks or process the code\nsnippet in the same way as NL, neglecting the special characteristics of PL\nsuch as token types. We present CodeT5, a unified pre-trained encoder-decoder\nTransformer model that better leverages the code semantics conveyed from the\ndeveloper-assigned identifiers. Our model employs a unified framework to\nseamlessly support both code understanding and generation tasks and allows for\nmulti-task learning. Besides, we propose a novel identifier-aware pre-training\ntask that enables the model to distinguish which code tokens are identifiers\nand to recover them when they are masked. Furthermore, we propose to exploit\nthe user-written code comments with a bimodal dual generation task for better\nNL-PL alignment. Comprehensive experiments show that CodeT5 significantly\noutperforms prior methods on understanding tasks such as code defect detection\nand clone detection, and generation tasks across various directions including\nPL-NL, NL-PL, and PL-PL. Further analysis reveals that our model can better\ncapture semantic information from code. Our code and pre-trained models are\nreleased at https: //github.com/salesforce/CodeT5 .",

RRT generates a set of way points and the velocity obstacles\nmethod ensures safe travel between way points. We also ensure that the actions\nof ASVs do not violate maritime collision guidelines. Earlier work has used RRT\nand VO separately to generate paths for ASVs. However, RRT does not handle\nhighly dynamic situations well and and VO seems most suitable as a local path\nplanner. Combining both approaches, VORRT-COLREGs is a global path planner that\nuses a joint forward simulation to ensure that generated paths remain valid and\ncollision free as the situation changes. Experiments were conducted in\ndifferent types of collision scenarios and with different numbers of ASVs.\nResults show that VORRT-COLREGS generated collision regulations (COLREGs)\ncomplaint paths in open ocean scenarios. Furthermore, VORRT-COLREGS\nsuccessfully generated compliant paths within traffic separation schemes.

Towards a unifying treatment of fairness and\neconomic efficiency objectives, we develop an algorithmic framework for finding\nonline allocations to maximize the generalized mean of the values received by\nthe agents. In particular, working with the assumption that each agent's value\nfor the grand bundle of goods is appropriately scaled, we address online\nmaximization of $p$-mean welfare. Parameterized by an exponent term $p \\in\n(-\\infty, 1]$, these means encapsulate a range of welfare functions, including\nsocial welfare ($p=1$), egalitarian welfare ($p \\to -\\infty$), and Nash social\nwelfare ($p \\to 0$).\nWe present a simple algorithmic template that takes a threshold as input and,\nwith judicious choices for this threshold, leads to both universal and tailored\ncompetitive guarantees.

However, there\nare many practical implementation limitations, especially overload power\nconsumption, high probability of blockage, and dynamic propagation environment.\nFortunately, the recent technology reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is\nexpected to be one of the most cost-efficient solutions to address such issues.\nRIS with low-cost elements can bypass blockages and create multiple\nline-of-sight (LoS) links, and provide controllable communication channels. In\nthis paper, we present a comprehensive literature review on the RIS-assisted\nnon-terrestrial networks (RANTNs). Firstly, the framework of the RANTNs is\nintroduced with detailed discussion about distinct properties of RIS in NTNs\nand the two types of RIS, that is, terrestrial RISs (TRISs), and aerial RISs\n(ARISs), and the classification of RANTNs including RIS-assisted air-to-ground\n(A2G)/ground-to-air (G2A), ARIS-assisted ground-to-ground (G2G), and\nRIS-assisted air-to-air (A2A) communications. In combination with\nnext-generation communication technologies, the advanced technologies in RANTNs\nare discussed. Then we overview the literature related to RANTNs from the\nperspectives of performance analysis and optimization, followed by the widely\nused methodologies. Finally, open challenges and future research direction in\nthe context of the RANTNs are highlighted.",

We focus on improving information sharing\nbetween agents and propose a new multi-agent actor-critic method called\n\\textit{Multi-Agent Cooperative Recurrent Proximal Policy Optimization}\n(MACRPO). We propose two novel ways of integrating information across agents\nand time in MACRPO: First, we use a recurrent layer in critic's network\narchitecture and propose a new framework to use a meta-trajectory to train the\nrecurrent layer. This allows the network to learn the cooperation and dynamics\nof interactions between agents, and also handle partial observability. Second,\nwe propose a new advantage function that incorporates other agents' rewards and\nvalue functions. We evaluate our algorithm on three challenging multi-agent\nenvironments with continuous and discrete action spaces, Deepdrive-Zero,\nMulti-Walker, and Particle environment.

    "abstract": "In recent years, cross-media hashing technique has attracted increasing\nattention for its high computation efficiency and low storage cost. However,\nthe existing approaches still have some limitations, which need to be explored.\n1) A fixed hash length (e.g., 16bits or 32bits) is predefined before learning\nthe binary codes. Therefore, these models need to be retrained when the hash\nlength changes, that consumes additional computation power, reducing the\nscalability in practical applications. 2) Existing cross-modal approaches only\nexplore the information in the original multimedia data to perform the hash\nlearning, without exploiting the semantic information contained in the learned\nhash codes. To this end, we develop a novel Multiple hash cOdes jOint learNing\nmethod (MOON) for cross-media retrieval. Specifically, the developed MOON\nsynchronously learns the hash codes with multiple lengths in a unified\nframework. Besides, to enhance the underlying discrimination, we combine the\nclues from the multimodal data, semantic labels and learned hash codes for hash\nlearning. As far as we know, the proposed MOON is the first work to\nsimultaneously learn different length hash codes without retraining in\ncross-media retrieval.

    "abstract": "In the context of the global coronavirus pandemic, different deep learning\nsolutions for infected subject detection using chest X-ray images have been\nproposed. However, deep learning models usually need large labelled datasets to\nbe effective. Semi-supervised deep learning is an attractive alternative, where\nunlabelled data is leveraged to improve the overall model's accuracy. However,\nin real-world usage settings, an unlabelled dataset might present a different\ndistribution than the labelled dataset (i.e. the labelled dataset was sampled\nfrom a target clinic and the unlabelled dataset from a source clinic). This\nresults in a distribution mismatch between the unlabelled and labelled\ndatasets. In this work, we assess the impact of the distribution mismatch\nbetween the labelled and the unlabelled datasets, for a semi-supervised model\ntrained with chest X-ray images, for COVID-19 detection. Under strong\ndistribution mismatch conditions, we found an accuracy hit of almost 30\\%,\nsuggesting that the unlabelled dataset distribution has a strong influence in\nthe behaviour of the model. Therefore, we propose a straightforward approach to\ndiminish the impact of such distribution mismatch. Our proposed method uses a\ndensity approximation of the feature space. It is built upon the target dataset\nto filter out the observations in the source unlabelled dataset that might harm\nthe accuracy of the semi-supervised model. It assumes that a small labelled\nsource dataset is available together with a larger source unlabelled dataset.\nOur proposed method does not require any model training, it is simple and\ncomputationally cheap. We compare our proposed method against two popular state\nof the art out-of-distribution data detectors, which are also cheap and simple\nto implement. In our tests, our method yielded accuracy gains of up to 32\\%,\nwhen compared to the previous state of the art methods.",

These algorithms have advantages and disadvantages against each\nother on different issues. For this reason, a scenario was created to compare\nalgorithms. On a curved double lane road created according to this scenario,\nMIT RACECAR has to follow the lanes and when it encounters an obstacle, it has\nto change lanes without leaving the road and pass without hitting the obstacle.\nIn addition, an image processing algorithm was developed to obtain the position\ninformation of the lanes needed to implement this scenario. This algorithm\ndetects the target point by processing the image taken from the ZED camera and\ngives the target point information to the path planning algorithm.\nAfter the necessary tools were created, the algorithms were tested against\nthe scenario. In these tests, measurements such as how many obstacles the\nalgorithm successfully passed, how simple routes it chose, and computational\ncosts they have. According to these results, although it was not the algorithm\nthat successfully passed the most obstacles, APF was chosen due to its low\nprocessing load and simple working logic.

Diversity in the pose,\nscale, and position of objects in an image makes the problem even more\ndifficult.

The\nself-training (ST) process of STU-net has two steps. First, different from\ntraditional studies regarding the WPC modeling as a curve fitting problem, in\nthis paper, we renovate the WPC modeling formulation from a machine vision\naspect. To develop sufficiently diversified training samples, we synthesize\nsupervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data based on a set of S-shape\nfunctions depicting WPCs. These synthesized SCADA data and WPC functions are\nvisualized as images and paired as training samples(I_x, I_wpc). A U-net is\nthen developed to approximate the model recovering I_wpc from I_x. The\ndeveloped U-net is applied into observed SCADA data and can successfully\ngenerate the I_wpc. Moreover, we develop a pixel mapping and correction process\nto derive a mathematical form f_wpc representing I_wpcgenerated previously. The\nproposed STU-net only needs to train once and does not require any data\npreprocessing in applications. Numerical experiments based on 76 WTs are\nconducted to validate the superiority of the proposed method by benchmarking\nagainst classical WPC modeling methods.

    "abstract": "Attributed to the ever-increasing large image datasets, Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs) have become popular for vision-based tasks. It is generally\nadmirable to have larger-sized datasets for higher network training accuracies.\nHowever, the impact of dataset quality has not to be involved. It is reasonable\nto assume the near-duplicate images exist in the datasets. For instance, the\nStreet View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset having cropped house plate digits from\n0 to 9 are likely to have repetitive digits from the same/similar house plates.\nRedundant images may take up a certain portion of the dataset without\nconsciousness. While contributing little to no accuracy improvement for the\nCNNs training, these duplicated images unnecessarily pose extra resource and\ncomputation consumption. To this end, this paper proposes a framework to assess\nthe impact of the near-duplicate images on CNN training performance, called\nCE-Dedup. Specifically, CE-Dedup associates a hashing-based image deduplication\napproach with downstream CNNs-based image classification tasks. CE-Dedup\nbalances the tradeoff between a large deduplication ratio and a stable accuracy\nby adjusting the deduplication threshold. The effectiveness of CE-Dedup is\nvalidated through extensive experiments on well-known CNN benchmarks. On one\nhand, while maintaining the same validation accuracy, CE-Dedup can reduce the\ndataset size by 23%. On the other hand, when allowing a small validation\naccuracy drop (by 5%), CE-Dedup can trim the dataset size by 75%.",

Multi-source data\nfusion solves the missing data problem caused by occlusion and achieves\naccurate, rapid, and complete collection of holographic spatial and temporal\ninformation in complex urban scenes. We carried out an experiment on Baisha\nTown, Chongqing, China and obtained multi-sensor, multi-angle data from UAV and\nmobile mapping vehicle. We first extracted the point cloud from UAV and then\nintegrated the UAV and mobile mapping vehicle point cloud. The integrated\nresults combined both the characteristic of UAV and mobile mapping vehicle\npoint cloud, confirming the practicability of the proposed joint data\nacquisition platform and the effectiveness of spatio-temporal-spectral-angular\nobservation model. Compared with the observation from UAV or mobile mapping\nvehicle alone, the integrated system provides an effective data acquisition\nsolution towards comprehensive urban monitoring.",

Concurrently, the sparsification of Neural Network\nmodels attracts a great amount of academic and industrial interest. In this\npaper, we conduct a structured study of the effect of sparsification on the\ntrainable part of MPNNs known as the Update step. To this end, we design a\nseries of models to successively sparsify the linear transform in the Update\nstep. Specifically, we propose the ExpanderGNN model with a tuneable\nsparsification rate and the Activation-Only GNN, which has no linear transform\nin the Update step. In agreement with a growing trend in the literature, the\nsparsification paradigm is changed by initialising sparse neural network\narchitectures rather than expensively sparsifying already trained\narchitectures. Our novel benchmark models enable a better understanding of the\ninfluence of the Update step on model performance and outperform existing\nsimplified benchmark models such as the Simple Graph Convolution. The\nExpanderGNNs, and in some cases the Activation-Only models, achieve performance\non par with their vanilla counterparts on several downstream tasks while\ncontaining significantly fewer trainable parameters. In experiments with\nmatching parameter numbers, our benchmark models outperform the\nstate-of-the-art GNN models. Our code is publicly available at:\nhttps://github.com/ChangminWu/ExpanderGNN.",

Multi-target domain adaptation is a powerful extension in\nwhich a single classifier is learned for multiple unlabeled target domains. To\nbuild a multi-target classifier, it is crucial to effectively aggregate\nfeatures from the labeled source and different unlabeled target domains.\nTowards this, recently introduced Domain-aware Curriculum Graph Co-Teaching\n(D-CGCT) exploits dual classifier head, one of which is based on the graph\nneural network. D-CGCT uses a sequential adaptation strategy that adapts one\ndomain at a time starting from the target domains that are more similar to the\nsource, assuming that the network finds it easier to adapt to such target\ndomains.

In this paper, we\ndemonstrate a system, called MultiCategory, which processes multi-model queries\nbased on category theory and functional programming. This demo is centered\naround four main scenarios to show a tangible system. First, we show how to\nbuild a schema category and an instance category by loading different models of\ndata, including relational, XML, key-value, and graph data. Second, we show a\nfew examples of query processing by using the functional programming language\nHaskell. Third, we demo the flexible outputs with different models of data for\nthe same input query. Fourth, to better understand the category theoretical\nstructure behind the queries, we offer a variety of graphical hooks to explore\nand visualize queries as graphs with respect to the schema category, as well as\nthe query processing procedure with Haskell.",

The proposed compaction strategy was\nvalidated by resorting to a RISC-V processor and several test programs stemming\nfrom diverse generation strategies.

It often attempts to\nsuggest a sequence of point of interests (POIs) for a user who requests a\npersonalized travel demand. Conventional methods either leverage the heuristic\nalgorithms (e.g., dynamic programming) or statistical analysis (e.g., Markov\nmodels) to search or rank a POI sequence. These procedures may fail to capture\nthe diversity of human needs and transitional regularities. They even provide\nrecommendations that deviate from tourists' real travel intention when the trip\ndata is sparse.

The design makes use of Orthogonal Frequency Division\nMultiple Access (OFDMA) as a means to achieve URC. Compared with Time-Division\nMultiple Access (TDMA), OFDMA concentrates the transmit power to a narrower\nbandwidth, resulting in higher effective SNR. Compared with Frequency-Division\nMultiple Access (FDMA), OFDMA has higher spectrum efficiency thanks to the\nsmaller subcarrier spacing. Although OFDMA has been introduced in 802.11ax, the\npurpose was to add flexibility in spectrum usage. Our Reliable OFDMA design,\nreferred to as ROFA, is a clean-slate design with a single goal of\nultra-reliable packet delivery. ROFA solves a number of key challenges to\nensure the ultra-reliability: (1) a downlink-coordinated time-synchronization\nmechanism to synchronize the uplink transmission of users, with at most $0.1us$\ntiming offset; (2) an \"STF-free\" packet reception synchronization method that\nmakes use of the property of synchronous systems to avoid packet misdetection;\nand (3) an uplink precoding mechanism to reduce the CFOs between users and the\nAP to a negligible level.

    "abstract": "Secure multi-party computation (MPC) allows parties to perform computations\non data while keeping that data private. This capability has great potential\nfor machine-learning applications: it facilitates training of machine-learning\nmodels on private data sets owned by different parties, evaluation of one\nparty's private model using another party's private data, etc. Although a range\nof studies implement machine-learning models via secure MPC, such\nimplementations are not yet mainstream. Adoption of secure MPC is hampered by\nthe absence of flexible software frameworks that \"speak the language\" of\nmachine-learning researchers and engineers. To foster adoption of secure MPC in\nmachine learning, we present CrypTen: a software framework that exposes popular\nsecure MPC primitives via abstractions that are common in modern\nmachine-learning frameworks, such as tensor computations, automatic\ndifferentiation, and modular neural networks. This paper describes the design\nof CrypTen and measure its performance on state-of-the-art models for text\nclassification, speech recognition, and image classification. Our benchmarks\nshow that CrypTen's GPU support and high-performance communication between (an\narbitrary number of) parties allows it to perform efficient private evaluation\nof modern machine-learning models under a semi-honest threat model.

    "abstract": "While many efforts are currently devoted to vaccines development and\nadministration, social distancing measures, including severe restrictions such\nas lockdowns, remain fundamental tools to contain the spread of COVID-19. A\ncrucial point for any government is to understand, on the basis of the epidemic\ncurve, the right temporal instant to set up a lockdown and then to remove it.\nDifferent strategies are being adopted with distinct shades of intensity. USA\nand Europe tend to introduce restrictions of considerable temporal length. They\nvary in time: a severe lockdown may be reached and then gradually relaxed. An\ninteresting alternative is the Australian model where short and sharp responses\nhave repeatedly tackled the virus and allowed people a return to near normalcy.\nAfter a few positive cases are detected, a lockdown is immediately set. In this\npaper we show that the Australian model can be generalized and given a rigorous\nmathematical analysis, casting strategies of the type short-term pain for\ncollective gain in the context of sliding-mode control, an important branch of\nnonlinear control theory. This allows us to gain important insights regarding\nhow to implement short-term lockdowns, obtaining a better understanding of\ntheir merits and possible limitations. Our model predicts the duration of the\nsevere lockdown to be set to maintain e.g. the number of people in intensive\ncare under a certain threshold. After tuning our strategy exploiting data\ncollected in Italy, it turns out that COVID-19 epidemic could be e.g.\ncontrolled by alternating one or two weeks of complete lockdown with one or two\nmonths of freedom, respectively. Control strategies of this kind, where the\nlockdown's duration is well circumscribed, could be important also to alleviate\ncoronavirus impact on economy.",

Existing fuzzers\nhave no knowledge of such constraints, and existing constraint extraction\ntechniques are ineffective for extracting DL specific input constraints. To\nfill this gap, we design and implement a document guided fuzzing technique,\nD2C, for API functions of DL libraries.

D2C also generates inputs that violate these constraints to test\nthe input validity checking code. In addition, D2C uses the constraints to\ngenerate boundary inputs to detect more bugs. Our evaluation of three popular\nDL libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch, and MXNet) shows that D2C's accuracy in\nextracting input constraints is 83.3% to 90.0%.

Both are hard with\ncasual capture and dynamic scenes: SfM produces noisy and spatio-temporally\nsparse reconstructed point clouds, resulting in NVS with spatio-temporally\ninconsistent effects. We consider SfM and NVS parts together to ease the\nchallenge. First, for SfM, we recover stable camera poses, then we defer the\nrequirement for temporally-consistent points across the scene and reconstruct\nonly a sparse point cloud per timestep that is noisy in space-time. Second, for\nNVS, we present a variational diffusion formulation on depths and colors that\nlets us robustly cope with the noise by enforcing spatio-temporal consistency\nvia per-pixel reprojection weights derived from the input views. Together, this\ndeferred approach generates novel views for dynamic scenes without requiring\nchallenging spatio-temporally consistent reconstructions nor training complex\nmodels on large datasets.

The key idea is to transform numerical time series to\nsymbolic representations in the time or frequency domain, i.e., sequences of\nsymbols, and then extract features from these sequences. While achieving high\naccuracy, existing symbolic classifiers are computationally expensive. In this\npaper we present MrSQM, a new time series classifier which uses multiple\nsymbolic representations and efficient sequence mining, to extract important\ntime series features. We study four feature selection approaches on symbolic\nsequences, ranging from fully supervised, to unsupervised and hybrids. We\npropose a new approach for optimal supervised symbolic feature selection in\nall-subsequence space, by adapting a Chi-squared bound developed for\ndiscriminative pattern mining, to time series. Our extensive experiments on 112\ndatasets of the UEA/UCR benchmark demonstrate that MrSQM can quickly extract\nuseful features and learn accurate classifiers with the classic logistic\nregression algorithm. Interestingly, we find that a very simple and fast\nfeature selection strategy can be highly effective as compared with more\nsophisticated and expensive methods.

The typical approach is to\nincorporate physical domain knowledge as soft constraints on an empirical loss\nfunction and use existing machine learning methodologies to train the model. We\ndemonstrate that, while existing PINN methodologies can learn good models for\nrelatively trivial problems, they can easily fail to learn relevant physical\nphenomena even for simple PDEs. In particular, we analyze several distinct\nsituations of widespread physical interest, including learning differential\nequations with convection, reaction, and diffusion operators. We provide\nevidence that the soft regularization in PINNs, which involves differential\noperators, can introduce a number of subtle problems, including making the\nproblem ill-conditioned. Importantly, we show that these possible failure modes\nare not due to the lack of expressivity in the NN architecture, but that the\nPINN's setup makes the loss landscape very hard to optimize. We then describe\ntwo promising solutions to address these failure modes. The first approach is\nto use curriculum regularization, where the PINN's loss term starts from a\nsimple PDE regularization, and becomes progressively more complex as the NN\ngets trained. The second approach is to pose the problem as a\nsequence-to-sequence learning task, rather than learning to predict the entire\nspace-time at once. Extensive testing shows that we can achieve up to 1-2\norders of magnitude lower error with these methods as compared to regular PINN\ntraining.",

    "abstract": "Single image 3D photography enables viewers to view a still image from novel\nviewpoints. Recent approaches combine monocular depth networks with inpainting\nnetworks to achieve compelling results. A drawback of these techniques is the\nuse of hard depth layering, making them unable to model intricate appearance\ndetails such as thin hair-like structures. We present SLIDE, a modular and\nunified system for single image 3D photography that uses a simple yet effective\nsoft layering strategy to better preserve appearance details in novel views. In\naddition, we propose a novel depth-aware training strategy for our inpainting\nmodule, better suited for the 3D photography task. The resulting SLIDE approach\nis modular, enabling the use of other components such as segmentation and\nmatting for improved layering. At the same time, SLIDE uses an efficient\nlayered depth formulation that only requires a single forward pass through the\ncomponent networks to produce high quality 3D photos. Extensive experimental\nanalysis on three view-synthesis datasets, in combination with user studies on\nin-the-wild image collections, demonstrate superior performance of our\ntechnique in comparison to existing strong baselines while being conceptually\nmuch simpler.

Here, we present two examples of nonconvex\nproblems in optimization and sampling where continuous symmetries play --\nimplicitly or explicitly -- a key role in the development of efficient\nalgorithms. These examples rely on deep and hidden connections between\nnonconvex symmetric manifolds and convex polytopes, and are heavily\ngeneralizable.

We first present the\nbasics of Lie groups, Lie algebras, and the adjoint actions associated with\nthem, and we also mention the classification theorem for Lie algebras.\nSubsequently, we present Kostant's convexity theorem and show how it allows us\nto reduce linear optimization problems over orbits of Lie groups to linear\noptimization problems over polytopes. Finally, we present the Harish-Chandra\nand the Harish-Chandra--Itzykson--Zuber (HCIZ) formulas, which convert\npartition functions (integrals) over Lie groups into sums over the\ncorresponding (discrete) Weyl groups, enabling efficient sampling algorithms.",

    "abstract": "The ability to find correspondences in visual data is the essence of most\ncomputer vision tasks. But what are the right correspondences? The task of\nvisual correspondence is well defined for two different images of same object\ninstance. In case of two images of objects belonging to same category, visual\ncorrespondence is reasonably well-defined in most cases. But what about\ncorrespondence between two objects of completely different category -- e.g., a\nshoe and a bottle? Does there exist any correspondence? Inspired by humans'\nability to: (a) generalize beyond semantic categories and; (b) infer functional\naffordances, we introduce the problem of functional correspondences in this\npaper. Given images of two objects, we ask a simple question: what is the set\nof correspondences between these two images for a given task? For example, what\nare the correspondences between a bottle and shoe for the task of pounding or\nthe task of pouring. We introduce a new dataset: FunKPoint that has ground\ntruth correspondences for 10 tasks and 20 object categories. We also introduce\na modular task-driven representation for attacking this problem and demonstrate\nthat our learned representation is effective for this task. But most\nimportantly, because our supervision signal is not bound by semantics, we show\nthat our learned representation can generalize better on few-shot\nclassification problem.

Our experiments show that malicious actors\nwho diverge from the proposed transaction selection strategy make more profit\nas compared to honest miners.

    "abstract": "The projected gradient descent (PGD) method has shown to be effective in\nrecovering compressed signals described in a data-driven way by a generative\nmodel, i.e., a generator which has learned the data distribution. Further\nreconstruction improvements for such inverse problems can be achieved by\nconditioning the generator on the measurement. The boundary equilibrium\ngenerative adversarial network (BEGAN) implements an equilibrium based loss\nfunction and an auto-encoding discriminator to better balance the performance\nof the generator and the discriminator. In this work we investigate a\nnetwork-based projected gradient descent (NPGD) algorithm for\nmeasurement-conditional generative models to solve the inverse problem much\nfaster than regular PGD. We combine the NPGD with conditional GAN/BEGAN to\nevaluate their effectiveness in solving compressed sensing type problems. Our\nexperiments on the MNIST and CelebA datasets show that the combination of\nmeasurement conditional model with NPGD works well in recovering the compressed\nsignal while achieving similar or in some cases even better performance along\nwith a much faster reconstruction. The achieved reconstruction speed-up in our\nexperiments is up to 140-175.",

    "abstract": "Background: Previous studies have shown that up to 99.59 % of the Java apps\nusing crypto APIs misuse the API at least once. However, these studies have\nbeen conducted on Java and C, while empirical studies for other languages are\nmissing. For example, a controlled user study with crypto tasks in Python has\nshown that 68.5 % of the professional developers write a secure solution for a\ncrypto task. Aims: To understand if this observation holds for real-world code,\nwe conducted a study of crypto misuses in Python. Method: We developed a static\nanalysis tool that covers common misuses of 5 different Python crypto APIs.\nWith this analysis, we analyzed 895 popular Python projects from GitHub and 51\nMicroPython projects for embedded devices. Further, we compared our results\nwith the findings of previous studies. Results: Our analysis reveals that 52.26\n% of the Python projects have at least one misuse. Further, some Python crypto\nlibraries API design helps developers from misusing crypto functions, which\nwere much more common in studies conducted with Java and C code. Conclusion: We\nconclude that we can see a positive impact of the good API design on crypto\nmisuses for Python applications. Further, our analysis of MicroPython projects\nreveals the importance of hybrid analyses.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of learning a range of vision-based manipulation tasks\nfrom a large offline dataset of robot interaction. In order to accomplish this,\nhumans need easy and effective ways of specifying tasks to the robot. Goal\nimages are one popular form of task specification, as they are already grounded\nin the robot's observation space. However, goal images also have a number of\ndrawbacks: they are inconvenient for humans to provide, they can over-specify\nthe desired behavior leading to a sparse reward signal, or under-specify task\ninformation in the case of non-goal reaching tasks. Natural language provides a\nconvenient and flexible alternative for task specification, but comes with the\nchallenge of grounding language in the robot's observation space. To scalably\nlearn this grounding we propose to leverage offline robot datasets (including\nhighly sub-optimal, autonomously collected data) with crowd-sourced natural\nlanguage labels. With this data, we learn a simple classifier which predicts if\na change in state completes a language instruction. This provides a\nlanguage-conditioned reward function that can then be used for offline\nmulti-task RL. In our experiments, we find that on language-conditioned\nmanipulation tasks our approach outperforms both goal-image specifications and\nlanguage conditioned imitation techniques by more than 25%, and is able to\nperform visuomotor tasks from natural language, such as \"open the right drawer\"\nand \"move the stapler\", on a Franka Emika Panda robot.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia (SZ) is a mental disorder whereby due to the secretion of\nspecific chemicals in the brain, the function of some brain regions is out of\nbalance, leading to the lack of coordination between thoughts, actions, and\nemotions. This study provides various intelligent Deep Learning (DL)-based\nmethods for automated SZ diagnosis via EEG signals. The obtained results are\ncompared with those of conventional intelligent methods. In order to implement\nthe proposed methods, the dataset of the Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology\nin Warsaw, Poland, has been used. First, EEG signals are divided into\n25-seconds time frames and then were normalized by z-score or norm L2. In the\nclassification step, two different approaches are considered for SZ diagnosis\nvia EEG signals. In this step, the classification of EEG signals is first\ncarried out by conventional DL methods, e.g., KNN, DT, SVM, Bayes, bagging, RF,\nand ET. Various proposed DL models, including LSTMs, 1D-CNNs, and 1D-CNN-LSTMs,\nare used in the following. In this step, the DL models were implemented and\ncompared with different activation functions. Among the proposed DL models, the\nCNN-LSTM architecture has had the best performance. In this architecture, the\nReLU activation function and the z-score and L2 combined normalization are\nused. The proposed CNN-LSTM model has achieved an accuracy percentage of\n99.25\\%, better than the results of most former studies in this field.

    "abstract": "The number of parameters in deep neural networks (DNNs) is scaling at about\n5$\\times$ the rate of Moore's Law. To sustain the pace of growth of the DNNs,\nnew technologies and computing architectures are needed. Photonic computing\nsystems are promising avenues, since they can perform the dominant general\nmatrix-matrix multiplication (GEMM) operations in DNNs at a higher throughput\nthan their electrical counterpart. However, purely photonic systems face\nseveral challenges including a lack of photonic memory, the need for conversion\ncircuits, and the accumulation of noise. In this paper, we propose a hybrid\nelectro-photonic system realizing the best of both worlds to accelerate DNNs.\nIn contrast to prior work in photonic and electronic accelerators, we adopt a\nsystem-level perspective. Our electro-photonic system includes an electronic\nhost processor and DRAM, and a custom electro-photonic hardware accelerator\ncalled ADEPT. The fused hardware accelerator leverages a photonic computing\nunit for performing highly-efficient GEMM operations and a digital electronic\nASIC for storage and for performing non-GEMM operations. We also identify\narchitectural optimization opportunities for improving the overall ADEPT's\nefficiency. We evaluate ADEPT using three state-of-the-art neural\nnetworks-ResNet-50, BERT-large, and RNN-T-to show its general applicability in\naccelerating today's DNNs.

Unlike existing neural\nnetwork based optimization method that relies on estimated correspondences, our\nmethod directly optimizes over implicit volumes, eliminating the challenging\nstep of matching pixels in indoor scenes. The key to our approach is to utilize\nthe learning-based priors to guide the optimization process of NeRF. Our system\nfirstly adapts a monocular depth network over the target scene by finetuning on\nits sparse SfM reconstruction. Then, we show that the shape-radiance ambiguity\nof NeRF still exists in indoor environments and propose to address the issue by\nemploying the adapted depth priors to monitor the sampling process of volume\nrendering. Finally, a per-pixel confidence map acquired by error computation on\nthe rendered image can be used to further improve the depth quality.\nExperiments show that our proposed framework significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods on indoor scenes, with surprising findings presented\non the effectiveness of correspondence-based optimization and NeRF-based\noptimization over the adapted depth priors. In addition, we show that the\nguided optimization scheme does not sacrifice the original synthesis capability\nof neural radiance fields, improving the rendering quality on both seen and\nnovel views.

However, delineation\nof the left ventricle is challenging due to the inherent properties of\nultrasound imaging, such as the presence of speckle noise and the low\nsignal-to-noise ratio. Methods: We propose a semi-automated segmentation\nalgorithm for the delineation of the left ventricle in temporal 3D\nechocardiography sequences.

Advantages of the method\ninclude no dependence on prior geometrical information, training data, or\nregistration from an atlas. Results: The method was evaluated using\nthree-dimensional ultrasound scan sequences from 18 patients from the\nMazankowski Alberta Heart Institute, Edmonton, Canada, and compared to manual\ndelineations provided by an expert cardiologist and four other registration\nalgorithms. The segmentation approach yielded the following results over the\ncardiac cycle: a mean absolute difference of 1.01 (0.21) mm, a Hausdorff\ndistance of 4.41 (1.43) mm, and a Dice overlap score of 0.93 (0.02).\nConclusions: The method performed well compared to the four other registration\nalgorithms.",

    "title": "Learning to Prompt for Vision-Language Models",
    "abstract": "Vision-language pre-training has recently emerged as a promising alternative\nfor representation learning. It shifts from the tradition of using images and\ndiscrete labels for learning a fixed set of weights, seen as visual concepts,\nto aligning images and raw text for two separate encoders. Such a paradigm\nbenefits from a broader source of supervision and allows zero-shot transfer to\ndownstream tasks since visual concepts can be diametrically generated from\nnatural language, known as prompt. In this paper, we identify that a major\nchallenge of deploying such models in practice is prompt engineering. This is\nbecause designing a proper prompt, especially for context words surrounding a\nclass name, requires domain expertise and typically takes a significant amount\nof time for words tuning since a slight change in wording could have a huge\nimpact on performance. Moreover, different downstream tasks require specific\ndesigns, further hampering the efficiency of deployment. To overcome this\nchallenge, we propose a novel approach named context optimization (CoOp). The\nmain idea is to model context in prompts using continuous representations and\nperform end-to-end learning from data while keeping the pre-trained parameters\nfixed. In this way, the design of task-relevant prompts can be fully automated.\nExperiments on 11 datasets show that CoOp effectively turns pre-trained\nvision-language models into data-efficient visual learners, requiring as few as\none or two shots to beat hand-crafted prompts with a decent margin and able to\ngain significant improvements when using more shots (e.g., at 16 shots the\naverage gain is around 17% with the highest reaching over 50%). CoOp also\nexhibits strong robustness to distribution shift.",

Automating the creation of such avatars would\nenable many applications in games, social networking, animation, and AR/VR to\nname a few. The key problem is one of representation. Standard 3D meshes are\nwidely used in modeling the minimally-clothed body but do not readily capture\nthe complex topology of clothing. Recent interest has shifted to implicit\nsurface models for this task but they are computationally heavy and lack\ncompatibility with existing 3D tools.

    "abstract": "Developer forums like StackOverflow have become essential resources to modern\nsoftware development practices. However, many code snippets lack a well-defined\nmethod declaration, and thus they are often incomplete for immediate reuse.\nDevelopers must adapt the retrieved code snippets by parameterizing the\nvariables involved and identifying the return value. This activity, which we\ncall APIzation of a code snippet, can be tedious and time-consuming. In this\npaper, we present APIzator to perform APIzations of Java code snippets\nautomatically. APIzator is grounded by four common patterns that we extracted\nby studying real APIzations in GitHub. APIzator presents a static analysis\nalgorithm that automatically extracts the method parameters and return\nstatements. We evaluated APIzator with a ground-truth of 200 APIzations\ncollected from 20 developers. For 113 (56.50 %) and 115 (57.50 %) APIzations,\nAPIzator and the developers extracted identical parameters and return\nstatements, respectively. For 163 (81.50 %) APIzations, either the parameters\nor the return statements were identical.",

We carry out a systematic investigation and\ncomprehensive verification on PINN for multiple physical effects in optical\nfibers, including dispersion, self-phase modulation, and higher-order nonlinear\neffects. Moreover, both special case (soliton propagation) and general case\n(multi-pulse propagation) are investigated and realized with PINN. In the\nprevious studies, the PINN was mainly effective for single scenario. To\novercome this problem, the physical parameters (pulse peak power and amplitudes\nof sub-pulses) are hereby embedded as additional input parameter controllers,\nwhich allow PINN to learn the physical constraints of different scenarios and\nperform good generalizability. Furthermore, PINN exhibits better performance\nthan the data-driven neural network using much less data, and its computational\ncomplexity (in terms of number of multiplications) is much lower than that of\nthe split-step Fourier method. The results report here show that the PINN is\nnot only an effective partial differential equation solver, but also a\nprospective technique to advance the scientific computing and automatic\nmodeling in fiber optics.",

Next, I describe a general approach\nto proving optimization lower bounds for arbitrary randomized algorithms (as\nopposed to more restricted classes of algorithms, e.g., deterministic or\n\"zero-respecting\" algorithms), which is used extensively throughout the thesis.\nFor the remainder of the thesis, I focus on the specific case of the\n\"intermittent communication setting\", where multiple computing devices work in\nparallel with limited communication amongst themselves. In this setting, I\nanalyze the theoretical properties of the popular Local Stochastic Gradient\nDescent (SGD) algorithm in convex setting, both for homogeneous and\nheterogeneous objectives. I provide the first guarantees for Local SGD that\nimprove over simple baseline methods, but show that Local SGD is not optimal in\ngeneral. In pursuit of optimal methods in the intermittent communication\nsetting, I then show matching upper and lower bounds for the intermittent\ncommunication setting with homogeneous convex, heterogeneous convex, and\nhomogeneous non-convex objectives. These upper bounds are attained by simple\nvariants of SGD which are therefore optimal.

    "abstract": "For real-life nonlinear systems, the exact form of nonlinearity is often not\nknown and the known governing equations are often based on certain assumptions\nand approximations. Such representation introduced model-form error into the\nsystem. In this paper, we propose a novel gray-box modeling approach that not\nonly identifies the model-form error but also utilizes it to improve the\npredictive capability of the known but approximate governing equation. The\nprimary idea is to treat the unknown model-form error as a residual force and\nestimate it using duel Bayesian filter based joint input-state estimation\nalgorithms. For improving the predictive capability of the underlying physics,\nwe first use machine learning algorithm to learn a mapping between the\nestimated state and the input (model-form error) and then introduce it into the\ngoverning equation as an additional term. This helps in improving the\npredictive capability of the governing physics and allows the model to\ngeneralize to unseen environment. Although in theory, any machine learning\nalgorithm can be used within the proposed framework, we use Gaussian process in\nthis work. To test the performance of proposed framework, case studies\ndiscussing four different dynamical systems are discussed; results for which\nindicate that the framework is applicable to a wide variety of systems and can\nproduce reliable estimates of original system's states.",

Our method integrates the robust finite\nmixture Gaussian regression model with spatial constraints, to simultaneously\nhandle the spatial nonstationarity, local homogeneity, and outlier\ncontaminations. Compared with existing spatial regression models, our proposed\nmodel assumes the existence a few distinct regression models that are estimated\nbased on observations that exhibit similar response-predictor relationships. As\nsuch, the proposed model not only accounts for nonstationarity in the spatial\ntrend, but also clusters observations into a few distinct and homogenous\ngroups. This provides an advantage on interpretation with a few stationary\nsub-processes identified that capture the predominant relationships between\nresponse and predictor variables. Moreover, the proposed method incorporates\nrobust procedures to handle contaminations from both regression outliers and\nspatial outliers. By doing so, we robustly segment the spatial domain into\ndistinct local regions with similar regression coefficients, and sporadic\nlocations that are purely outliers. Rigorous statistical hypothesis testing\nprocedure has been designed to test the significance of such segmentation.\nExperimental results on many synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the\nrobustness, accuracy, and effectiveness of our proposed method, compared with\nother robust finite mixture regression, spatial regression and spatial\nsegmentation methods.",

    "abstract": "The Free Energy Principle (FEP) postulates that biological agents perceive\nand interact with their environment in order to minimize a Variational Free\nEnergy (VFE) with respect to a generative model of their environment. The\ninference of a policy (future control sequence) according to the FEP is known\nas Active Inference (AIF). The AIF literature describes multiple VFE objectives\nfor policy planning that lead to epistemic (information-seeking) behavior.\nHowever, most objectives have limited modeling flexibility. This paper\napproaches epistemic behavior from a constrained Bethe Free Energy (CBFE)\nperspective. Crucially, variational optimization of the CBFE can be expressed\nin terms of message passing on free-form generative models. The key intuition\nbehind the CBFE is that we impose a point-mass constraint on predicted\noutcomes, which explicitly encodes the assumption that the agent will make\nobservations in the future. We interpret the CBFE objective in terms of its\nconstituent behavioral drives. We then illustrate resulting behavior of the\nCBFE by planning and interacting with a simulated T-maze environment.\nSimulations for the T-maze task illustrate how the CBFE agent exhibits an\nepistemic drive, and actively plans ahead to account for the impact of\npredicted outcomes. Compared to an EFE agent, the CBFE agent incurs expected\nreward in significantly more environmental scenarios.

While practitioners commonly combine ambiguous outcome labels in an\nad hoc way to improve the accuracy of multi-class classification, there lacks a\nprincipled approach to guide label combination by any optimality criterion. To\naddress this problem, we propose the information-theoretic classification\naccuracy (ITCA), a criterion of outcome \"information\" conditional on outcome\nprediction, to guide practitioners on how to combine ambiguous outcome labels.\nITCA indicates a balance in the trade-off between prediction accuracy (how well\ndo predicted labels agree with actual labels) and prediction resolution (how\nmany labels are predictable). To find the optimal label combination indicated\nby ITCA, we develop two search strategies: greedy search and breadth-first\nsearch. Notably, ITCA and the two search strategies are adaptive to all\nmachine-learning classification algorithms. Coupled with a classification\nalgorithm and a search strategy, ITCA has two uses: to improve prediction\naccuracy and to identify ambiguous labels. We first verify that ITCA achieves\nhigh accuracy with both search strategies in finding the correct label\ncombinations on synthetic and real data.

Identifying\nprospectivity-informative predictor variables from the 3D geological models is\na challenging and tedious task. Motivated by the ability of convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) to learn the intrinsic features, in this paper, we\npresent a novel method that leverages CNNs to learn 3D mineral prospectivity\nfrom the 3D geological models. By exploiting the learning ability of CNNs, the\npresented method allows for disentangling complex correlation to the\nmineralization and thus opens a door to circumvent the tedious work for\ndesigning the predictor variables. Specifically, to explore the unstructured 3D\ngeological models with the CNNs whose input should be structured, we develop a\n2D CNN framework in which the geometry of geological boundary is compiled and\nreorganized into multi-channel images and fed into the CNN. This ensures an\neffective and efficient training of CNNs while allowing the prospective model\nto approximate the ore-forming process. The presented method is applied to a\ntypical structure-controlled hydrothermal deposit, the Dayingezhuang gold\ndeposit, eastern China, in which the presented method was compared with the\nprospectivity modeling methods using hand-designed predictor variables.

    "abstract": "Although supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) often outperform\nconventional alternatives for denoising positron emission tomography (PET)\nimages, they require many low- and high-quality reference PET image pairs.\nHerein, we propose an unsupervised 3D PET image denoising method based on\nanatomical information-guided attention mechanism. Our proposed magnetic\nresonance-guided deep decoder (MR-GDD) utilizes the spatial details and\nsemantic features of MR-guidance image more effectively by introducing\nencoder-decoder and deep decoder subnetworks. Moreover, the specific shapes and\npatterns of the guidance image do not affect the denoised PET image, because\nthe guidance image is input to the network through an attention gate. Monte\nCarlo simulation using the [$^{18}$F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) shows that\nthe proposed method outperforms other denoising algorithms in terms of the\nhighest peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity (28.33 dB/0.886).\nFurthermore, we experimentally visualized the behavior of the optimization\nprocess, which is often unknown in unsupervised CNN-based restoration problems.\nFor preclinical (using [$^{18}$F]FDG and [$^{11}$C]raclopride) and clinical\n(using [$^{18}$F]florbetapir) studies, the proposed method demonstrates\nstate-of-the-art denoising performance while retaining spatial resolution and\nquantitative accuracy, despite using only a single architecture for various\nnoisy PET images with 1/10th of the full counts. These results suggest that the\nproposed MR-GDD can reduce PET scan times and PET tracer doses considerably\nwithout impacting patients.",

Improved accented pronunciations\nhave thus been obtained by learning foreign pronunciations directly from data.\nFurthermore, a code-switching LM was deployed by converting the original NL LM\ninto a CS LM using translated word pairs and borrowing statistics for the NL\nLM. Experimental evidence clearly demonstrates that our approach better deals\nwith accented foreign pronunciations than techniques based on human labeling.\nMoreover, our best system achieves a 55.5% relative word error rate reduction\nfrom 34.4%, obtained with a conventional monolingual ASR system, to 15.3% on an\nintra-sentential CS task without harming the monolingual recognition accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Several academics have studied the ability of hybrid models mixing univariate\nGeneralized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models and\nneural networks to deliver better volatility predictions than purely\neconometric models. Despite presenting very promising results, the\ngeneralization of such models to the multivariate case has yet to be studied.\nMoreover, very few papers have examined the ability of neural networks to\npredict the covariance matrix of asset returns, and all use a rather small\nnumber of assets, thus not addressing what is known as the curse of\ndimensionality. The goal of this paper is to investigate the ability of hybrid\nmodels, mixing GARCH processes and neural networks, to forecast covariance\nmatrices of asset returns. To do so, we propose a new model, based on\nmultivariate GARCHs that decompose volatility and correlation predictions. The\nvolatilities are here forecast using hybrid neural networks while correlations\nfollow a traditional econometric process. After implementing the models in a\nminimum variance portfolio framework, our results are as follows. First, the\naddition of GARCH parameters as inputs is beneficial to the model proposed.\nSecond, the use of one-hot-encoding to help the neural network differentiate\nbetween each stock improves the performance. Third, the new model proposed is\nvery promising as it not only outperforms the equally weighted portfolio, but\nalso by a significant margin its econometric counterpart that uses univariate\nGARCHs to predict the volatilities.",

    "title": "Can Error Mitigation Improve Trainability of Noisy Variational Quantum  Algorithms?",
    "abstract": "Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are widely viewed as the best hope for\nnear-term quantum advantage. However, recent studies have shown that noise can\nseverely limit the trainability of VQAs, e.g., by exponentially flattening the\ncost landscape and suppressing the magnitudes of cost gradients. Error\nMitigation (EM) shows promise in reducing the impact of noise on near-term\ndevices. Thus, it is natural to ask whether EM can improve the trainability of\nVQAs. In this work, we first show that, for a broad class of EM strategies,\nexponential cost concentration cannot be resolved without committing\nexponential resources elsewhere. This class of strategies includes as special\ncases Zero Noise Extrapolation, Virtual Distillation, Probabilistic Error\nCancellation, and Clifford Data Regression. Second, we perform analytical and\nnumerical analysis of these EM protocols, and we find that some of them (e.g.,\nVirtual Distillation) can make it harder to resolve cost function values\ncompared to running no EM at all. As a positive result, we do find numerical\nevidence that Clifford Data Regression (CDR) can aid the training process in\ncertain settings where cost concentration is not too severe. Our results show\nthat care should be taken in applying EM protocols as they can either worsen or\nnot improve trainability. On the other hand, our positive results for CDR\nhighlight the possibility of engineering error mitigation methods to improve\ntrainability.",

    "abstract": "Mixtures of high dimensional Gaussian distributions have been studied\nextensively in statistics and learning theory. While the total variation\ndistance appears naturally in the sample complexity of distribution learning,\nit is analytically difficult to obtain tight lower bounds for mixtures.\nExploiting a connection between total variation distance and the characteristic\nfunction of the mixture, we provide fairly tight functional approximations.\nThis enables us to derive new lower bounds on the total variation distance\nbetween pairs of two-component Gaussian mixtures that have a shared covariance\nmatrix.",

    "title": "Optimal subgroup selection",
    "abstract": "In clinical trials and other applications, we often see regions of the\nfeature space that appear to exhibit interesting behaviour, but it is unclear\nwhether these observed phenomena are reflected at the population level.\nFocusing on a regression setting, we consider the subgroup selection challenge\nof identifying a region of the feature space on which the regression function\nexceeds a pre-determined threshold. We formulate the problem as one of\nconstrained optimisation, where we seek a low-complexity, data-dependent\nselection set on which, with a guaranteed probability, the regression function\nis uniformly at least as large as the threshold; subject to this constraint, we\nwould like the region to contain as much mass under the marginal feature\ndistribution as possible. This leads to a natural notion of regret, and our\nmain contribution is to determine the minimax optimal rate for this regret in\nboth the sample size and the Type I error probability. The rate involves a\ndelicate interplay between parameters that control the smoothness of the\nregression function, as well as exponents that quantify the extent to which the\noptimal selection set at the population level can be approximated by families\nof well-behaved subsets. Finally, we expand the scope of our previous results\nby illustrating how they may be generalised to a treatment and control setting,\nwhere interest lies in the heterogeneous treatment effect.",

The weights are related to the uncertainty\nassociated with the solutions of each subproblem, and are efficiently computed\nusing low-rank approximations.
