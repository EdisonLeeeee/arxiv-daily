    "abstract": "Future Moon bases will likely be constructed using resources mined from the\nsurface of the Moon. The difficulty of maintaining a human workforce on the\nMoon and communications lag with Earth means that mining will need to be\nconducted using collaborative robots with a high degree of autonomy. In this\npaper, we explore the utility of robotic vision towards addressing several\nmajor challenges in autonomous mining in the lunar environment: lack of\nsatellite positioning systems, navigation in hazardous terrain, and delicate\nrobot interactions. Specifically, we describe and report the results of robotic\nvision algorithms that we developed for Phase 2 of the NASA Space Robotics\nChallenge, which was framed in the context of autonomous collaborative robots\nfor mining on the Moon. The competition provided a simulated lunar environment\nthat exhibits the complexities alluded to above. We show how machine\nlearning-enabled vision could help alleviate the challenges posed by the lunar\nenvironment. A robust multi-robot coordinator was also developed to achieve\nlong-term operation and effective collaboration between robots.",

    "abstract": "Remaining useful life (RUL) refers to the expected remaining lifespan of a\ncomponent or system. Accurate RUL prediction is critical for prognostic and\nhealth management and for maintenance planning. In this work, we address three\nprevalent challenges in data-driven RUL prediction, namely the handling of high\ndimensional input features, the robustness to noise in sensor data and\nprognostic datasets, and the capturing of the time-dependency between system\ndegradation and RUL prediction. We devise a highly accurate RUL prediction\nmodel with uncertainty quantification, which integrates and leverages the\nadvantages of deep learning and nonstationary Gaussian process regression\n(DL-NSGPR). We examine and benchmark our model against other advanced\ndata-driven RUL prediction models using the turbofan engine dataset from the\nNASA prognostic repository. Our computational experiments show that the\nDL-NSGPR predictions are highly accurate with root mean square error 1.7 to 6.2\ntimes smaller than those of competing RUL models. Furthermore, the results\ndemonstrate that RUL uncertainty bounds with the proposed DL-NSGPR are both\nvalid and significantly tighter than other stochastic RUL prediction models. We\nunpack and discuss the reasons for this excellent performance of the DL-NSGPR.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous driving requires 3D maps that provide accurate and up-to-date\ninformation about semantic landmarks. Due to the wider availability and lower\ncost of cameras compared with laser scanners, vision-based mapping has\nattracted much attention from academia and industry. Among the existing\nsolutions, Structure-from-Motion (SfM) technology has proved to be feasible for\nbuilding 3D maps from crowdsourced data, since it allows unordered images as\ninput. Previous works on SfM have mainly focused on issues related to building\n3D point clouds and calculating camera poses, leaving the issues of automatic\nchange detection and localization open.\nWe propose in this paper an SfM-based solution for automatic map update, with\na focus on real-time change detection and localization. Our solution builds on\ncomparison of semantic map data (e.g. types and locations of traffic signs).\nThrough a novel design of the pixel-wise 3D localization algorithm, our system\ncan locate the objects detected from 2D images in a 3D space, utilizing sparse\nSfM point clouds. Experiments with dashcam videos collected from two urban\nareas prove that the system is able to locate visible traffic signs in front\nalong the driving direction with a median distance error of 1.52 meters.\nMoreover, it can detect up to 80\\% of the changes with a median distance error\nof 2.21 meters.

The main\nchallenge is to improve the expressivity of the models while keeping the\ninvertibility constraints intact. We propose to do so via the incorporation of\nlocalized self-attention. However, conventional self-attention mechanisms don't\nsatisfy the requirements to obtain invertible flows and can't be naively\nincorporated into normalizing flows.

We demonstrate\nthat ACF can be introduced into a variety of state of the art flow models in a\nplug-and-play manner. This is demonstrated to not only improve the\nrepresentation power of these models (improving on the bits per dim metric),\nbut also to results in significantly faster convergence in training them.\nQualitative results, including interpolations between test images, demonstrate\nthat samples are more realistic and capture local correlations in the data\nwell.

Many of the new modalities are necessary for IHE business.\nIn August 2019, we began collecting and analyzing data from the campus WIFI\nnetwork. A goal of the research was to answer question like what passive\nsensing of the IHE WIFI might tell us about the dynamics of the WIFI weather in\nthe IHE ecosystem and what does anonymized data tell us about the IHE\necosystem. The analogy with weather prediction seemed appropriate and a viable\napproach. Starting Fall 2019, data were collected in the observational phase.\nIn the analysis phase, we applied Singular Spectrum Analysis decomposition, to\ndeconstruct WIFI data from dorms, the central campus dining cafeteria, the\nrecreation center, and other buildings on campus. That analysis led to the\nidentification of clusters of buildings that behaved similarly. Just as in the\ncase of models of the weather, a final component of this research was\nforecasting. We found that weekly forecast of WIFI behavior in the Fall 2019,\nwere straight forward using SSA and seemed to present behavior of a low\ndimensional dynamical system. However, in Spring 2020, and the COVID\nperturbation, the campus ecosystem received a shock and data show that the\ncampus changed very quickly. We found that as the campus moved to conduct\nremote learning, teaching, the closure of research labs, and the edict to work\nremotely, SSA forecasting techniques not trained on the Spring 2020, data after\nthe shock, performed poorly.

    "abstract": "Spatiotemporal kriging is an important application in spatiotemporal data\nanalysis, aiming to recover/interpolate signals for unsampled/unobserved\nlocations based on observed signals. The principle challenge for spatiotemporal\nkriging is how to effectively model and leverage the spatiotemporal\ndependencies within the data. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown\ngreat promise for spatiotemporal kriging tasks. However, standard GNNs often\nrequire a carefully designed adjacency matrix and specific aggregation\nfunctions, which are inflexible for general applications/problems. To address\nthis issue, we present SATCN -- Spatial Aggregation and Temporal Convolution\nNetworks -- a universal and flexible framework to perform spatiotemporal\nkriging for various spatiotemporal datasets without the need for model\nspecification. Specifically, we propose a novel spatial aggregation network\n(SAN) inspired by Principal Neighborhood Aggregation, which uses multiple\naggregation functions to help one node gather diverse information from its\nneighbors. To exclude information from unsampled nodes, a masking strategy that\nprevents the unsampled sensors from sending messages to their neighborhood is\nintroduced to SAN. We capture temporal dependencies by the temporal\nconvolutional networks, which allows our model to cope with data of diverse\nsizes. To make SATCN generalizable to unseen nodes and even unseen graph\nstructures, we employ an inductive strategy to train SATCN. We conduct\nextensive experiments on three real-world spatiotemporal datasets, including\ntraffic speed and climate recordings. Our results demonstrate the superiority\nof SATCN over traditional and GNN-based kriging models.",

Generally speaking, RKC methods are low-order\nexplicit schemes with a stability domain growing quadratically with the number\nof function evaluations. For this reason, most of the computational effort is\nspent on stability rather than accuracy purposes. In this paper, we show that a\nna\\\"ive mixed-precision implementation of any Runge-Kutta scheme can harm the\nconvergence order of the method and limit its accuracy, and we introduce a new\nclass of mixed-precision RKC schemes that are instead unaffected by this\nlimiting behaviour.

These schemes perform only the few function evaluations needed for\naccuracy (1 or 2 for first- and second-order methods respectively) in high\nprecision, while the rest are performed in low precision.

    "abstract": "Multi-vehicle collision avoidance is a highly crucial problem due to the\nsoaring interests of introducing autonomous vehicles into the real world in\nrecent years. The safety of these vehicles while they complete their objectives\nis of paramount importance. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability is a promising\ntool for guaranteeing safety for low-dimensional systems. However, due to its\nexponential complexity in computation time, no reachability-based methods have\nbeen able to guarantee safety for more than three vehicles successfully in\nunstructured scenarios. For systems with four or more vehicles,we can only\nempirically validate their safety performance.While reachability-based safety\nmethods enjoy a flexible least-restrictive control strategy, it is challenging\nto reason about long-horizon trajectories online because safety at any given\nstate is determined by looking up its safety value in a pre-computed table that\ndoes not exhibit favorable properties that continuous functions have. This\nmotivates the problem of improving the safety performance of unstructured\nmulti-vehicle systems when safety cannot be guaranteed given any\nleast-restrictive safety-aware collision avoidance algorithm while avoiding\nonline trajectory optimization. In this paper, we propose a novel approach\nusing supervised learning to enhance the safety of vehicles by proposing new\ninitial states in very close neighborhood of the original initial states of\nvehicles.

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning pretrained models for automatically summarizing doctor-patient\nconversation transcripts presents many challenges: limited training data,\nsignificant domain shift, long and noisy transcripts, and high target summary\nvariability. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using pretrained\ntransformer models for automatically summarizing doctor-patient conversations\ndirectly from transcripts. We show that fluent and adequate summaries can be\ngenerated with limited training data by fine-tuning BART on a specially\nconstructed dataset. The resulting models greatly surpass the performance of an\naverage human annotator and the quality of previous published work for the\ntask. We evaluate multiple methods for handling long conversations, comparing\nthem to the obvious baseline of truncating the conversation to fit the\npretrained model length limit. We introduce a multistage approach that tackles\nthe task by learning two fine-tuned models: one for summarizing conversation\nchunks into partial summaries, followed by one for rewriting the collection of\npartial summaries into a complete summary. Using a carefully chosen fine-tuning\ndataset, this method is shown to be effective at handling longer conversations,\nimproving the quality of generated summaries. We conduct both an automatic\nevaluation (through ROUGE and two concept-based metrics focusing on medical\nfindings) and a human evaluation (through qualitative examples from literature,\nassessing hallucination, generalization, fluency, and general quality of the\ngenerated summaries).",

    "abstract": "We address the problem of designing a stabilizing closed-loop control law\ndirectly from input and state measurements collected in an open-loop\nexperiment. In the presence of noise in data, we have that a set of dynamics\ncould have generated the collected data and we need the designed controller to\nstabilize such set of data-consistent dynamics robustly. For this problem of\ndata-driven control with noisy data, we advocate the use of a popular tool from\nrobust control, Petersen's lemma. In the cases of data generated by linear and\npolynomial systems, we conveniently express the uncertainty captured in the set\nof data-consistent dynamics through a matrix ellipsoid, and we show that a\nspecific form of this matrix ellipsoid makes it possible to apply Petersen's\nlemma to all of the mentioned cases. In this way, we obtain necessary and\nsufficient conditions for data-driven stabilization of linear systems through a\nlinear matrix inequality. The matrix ellipsoid representation enables insights\nand interpretations of the designed control laws. In the same way, we also\nobtain sufficient conditions for data-driven stabilization of polynomial\nsystems through (convex) sum-of-squares programs. The findings are illustrated\nnumerically.",

    "abstract": "in healthcare. However, the existing AI model may be biased in its decision\nmarking. The bias induced by data itself, such as collecting data in subgroups\nonly, can be mitigated by including more diversified data. Distributed and\ncollaborative learning is an approach to involve training models in massive,\nheterogeneous, and distributed data sources, also known as nodes. In this work,\nwe target on examining the fairness issue in Swarm Learning (SL), a recent\nedge-computing based decentralized machine learning approach, which is designed\nfor heterogeneous illnesses detection in precision medicine. SL has achieved\nhigh performance in clinical applications, but no attempt has been made to\nevaluate if SL can improve fairness. To address the problem, we present an\nempirical study by comparing the fairness among single (node) training, SL,\ncentralized training. Specifically, we evaluate on large public available skin\nlesion dataset, which contains samples from various subgroups. The experiments\ndemonstrate that SL does not exacerbate the fairness problem compared to\ncentralized training and improves both performance and fairness compared to\nsingle training. However, there still exists biases in SL model and the\nimplementation of SL is more complex than the alternative two strategies.",

    "abstract": "Innovations from surgical robotic research rarely translates to live surgery\ndue to the significant difference between the lab and a live environment. Live\nenvironments require considerations that are often overlooked during early\nstages of research such as surgical staff, surgical procedure, and the\nchallenges of working with live tissue. One such example is the da Vinci\nResearch Kit (dVRK) which is used by over 40 robotics research groups and\nrepresents an open-sourced version of the da Vinci Surgical System. Despite\ndVRK being available for nearly a decade and the ideal candidate for\ntranslating research to practice on over 5,000 da Vinci Systems used in\nhospitals around the world, not one live surgery has been conducted with it. In\nthis paper, we address the challenges, considerations, and solutions for\ntranslating surgical robotic research from bench-to-bedside. This is explained\nfrom the perspective of a remote telesurgery scenario where motion scaling\nsolutions previously experimented in a lab setting are translated to a live pig\nsurgery. This study presents results from the first ever use of a dVRK in a\nlive animal and discusses how the surgical robotics community can approach\ntranslating their research to practice.",

Current VLP approaches\ndiffer on (i) model architecture (especially image embedders), (ii) loss\nfunctions, and (iii) masking policies. Image embedders are either deep models\nlike ResNet or linear projections that directly feed image-pixels into the\ntransformer.

In this paper, we present Masked Language and Image\nModeling (MLIM) for VLP. MLIM uses two loss functions: Masked Language Modeling\n(MLM) loss and image reconstruction (RECON) loss.

There are also two designated points on the plane, $S$ (the source) and\n$D$ (the destination). The robots are required to transmit the message from the\nsource to the destination as quickly as possible by face-to-face message\npassing.

We conduct a\nmulti-level text analysis on 36,984,559 tweets to investigate users' behaviors\nto examine the language used and understand the impact of digital activism on\nsocial media within each social movement on a sentence-level, word-level, and\ntopic-level. Our results show that excessive use of racially-related or\nprejudicial hashtags were used by the counter protests which portray potential\ndiscriminatory tendencies. Consequently, our findings highlight that social\nactivism done by Black Lives Matter activists does not diverge from the social\nissues and topics involving police-brutality related and racially-motivated\nkillings of Black individuals due to the shape of its topical graph that topics\nand conversations encircling the largest component directly relate to the topic\nof Black Lives Matter. Finally, we see that both Blue Lives Matter and All\nLives Matter movements depict a different directive, as the topics of Blue\nLives Matter or All Lives Matter do not reside in the center. These findings\nsuggest that topics and conversations within each social movement are skewed,\nrandom or possessed racially-related undertones, and thus, deviating from the\nprominent social injustice issues.",

It enables robots in a team to obtain relative bearing to\neach other, even in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) settings which is a very\nchallenging problem in robotics. It does so by analyzing the phase of their\ncommunicated WiFi signals as the robots traverse the environment. This\ncapability, based on the theory developed in our prior works, is made available\nfor the first time as an opensource tool. It is motivated by the lack of easily\ndeployable solutions that use robots' local resources (e.g WiFi) for sensing in\nNLOS. This has implications for localization, ad-hoc robot networks, and\nsecurity in multi-robot teams, amongst others. The toolbox is designed for\ndistributed and online deployment on robot platforms using commodity hardware\nand on-board sensors. We also release datasets demonstrating its performance in\nNLOS and line-of-sight (LOS) settings for a multi-robot localization usecase.\nEmpirical results show that the bearing estimation from our toolbox achieves\nmean accuracy of 5.10 degrees. This leads to a median error of 0.5m and 0.9m\nfor localization in LOS and NLOS settings respectively, in a hardware\ndeployment in an indoor office environment.",

    "abstract": "Although the importance of using static analysis to detect taint-style\nvulnerabilities in Linux-based embedded firmware is widely recognized, existing\napproaches are plagued by three major limitations. (a) Approaches based on\nsymbolic execution may miss alias information and therefore suffer from a high\nfalse-negative rate. (b) Approaches based on VSA (value set analysis) often\nprovide an over-approximate pointer range. As a result, many false positives\ncould be produced. (c) Existing work for detecting taint-style vulnerability\ndoes not consider indirect call resolution, whereas indirect calls are\nfrequently used in Internet-facing embedded devices. As a result, many false\nnegatives could be produced. In this work, we propose a precise demand-driven\nflow-, context- and field-sensitive alias analysis approach. Based on this new\napproach, we also design a novel indirect call resolution scheme. Combined with\nsanitization rule checking, our solution discovers taint-style vulnerabilities\nby static taint analysis. We implemented our idea with a prototype called\nEmTaint and evaluated it against 35 real-world embedded firmware samples from\nsix popular vendors. EmTaint discovered at least 192 bugs, including 41 n-day\nbugs and 151 0-day bugs. At least 115 CVE/PSV numbers have been allocated from\na subset of the reported vulnerabilities at the time of writing. Compared to\nstate-of-the-art tools such as KARONTE and SaTC, EmTaint found significantly\nmore bugs on the same dataset in less time.",

While\nthese attributes are crucial for a successful dialogue, it is also desirable to\nsimultaneously accomplish specific stylistic goals, such as response length,\npoint-of-view, descriptiveness, sentiment, formality, and empathy. In this\nwork, we focus on stylistic control and evaluation for schema-guided NLG, with\njoint goals of achieving both semantic and stylistic control. We experiment in\ndetail with various controlled generation methods for large pretrained language\nmodels: specifically, conditional training, guided fine-tuning, and guided\ndecoding. We discuss their advantages and limitations, and evaluate them with a\nbroad range of automatic and human evaluation metrics. Our results show that\nwhile high style accuracy and semantic correctness are easier to achieve for\nmore lexically-defined styles with conditional training, stylistic control is\nalso achievable for more semantically complex styles using discriminator-based\nguided decoding methods.

    "abstract": "In recent years, photogrammetry has been widely used in many areas to create\nphotorealistic 3D virtual data representing the physical environment. The\ninnovation of small unmanned aerial vehicles (sUAVs) has provided additional\nhigh-resolution imaging capabilities with low cost for mapping a relatively\nlarge area of interest. These cutting-edge technologies have caught the US Army\nand Navy's attention for the purpose of rapid 3D battlefield reconstruction,\nvirtual training, and simulations. Our previous works have demonstrated the\nimportance of information extraction from the derived photogrammetric data to\ncreate semantic-rich virtual environments (Chen et al., 2019). For example, an\nincrease of simulation realism and fidelity was achieved by segmenting and\nreplacing photogrammetric trees with game-ready tree models. In this work, we\nfurther investigated the semantic information extraction problem and focused on\nthe ground material segmentation and object detection tasks. The main\ninnovation of this work was that we leveraged both the original 2D images and\nthe derived 3D photogrammetric data to overcome the challenges faced when using\neach individual data source. For ground material segmentation, we utilized an\nexisting convolutional neural network architecture (i.e., 3DMV) which was\noriginally designed for segmenting RGB-D sensed indoor data. We improved its\nperformance for outdoor photogrammetric data by introducing a depth pooling\nlayer in the architecture to take into consideration the distance between the\nsource images and the reconstructed terrain model. To test the performance of\nour improved 3DMV, a ground truth ground material database was created using\ndata from the One World Terrain (OWT) data repository. Finally, a workflow for\nimporting the segmented ground materials into a virtual simulation scene was\nintroduced, and visual results are reported in this paper.",

Traditional solutions require that the items be picked to be placed\nin an orderly manner in the bin and that the exact dimensions of the items be\nknown beforehand.

We\nexperimentally verify the performance of our system by picking boxes using an\nABB IRB 1200 robot.

However, different from the matrix case, constructing\nreasonable sparse measure of tensor is a relatively difficult and very\nimportant task. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new tensor sparsity\nmeasure called Tensor Full Feature Measure (FFM). It can simultaneously\ndescribe the feature information of each dimension of the tensor and the\nrelated features between two dimensions, and connect the Tucker rank with the\ntensor tube rank. This measurement method can describe the sparse features of\nthe tensor more comprehensively. On this basis, we establish its non-convex\nrelaxation, and apply FFM to low rank tensor completion (LRTC) and tensor\nrobust principal component analysis (TRPCA). LRTC and TRPCA models based on FFM\nare proposed, and two efficient Alternating Direction Multiplier Method (ADMM)\nalgorithms are developed to solve the proposed model.

    "abstract": "The success of deep learning relies heavily on large datasets with extensive\nlabels, but we often only have access to several small, heterogeneous datasets\nassociated with partial labels, particularly in the field of medical imaging.\nWhen learning from multiple datasets, existing challenges include incomparable,\nheterogeneous, or even conflicting labeling protocols across datasets. In this\npaper, we propose a new initiative--\"data, assemble\"--which aims to unleash the\nfull potential of partially labeled data and enormous unlabeled data from an\nassembly of datasets. To accommodate the supervised learning paradigm to\npartial labels, we introduce a dynamic adapter that encodes multiple visual\ntasks and aggregates image features in a question-and-answer manner.\nFurthermore, we employ pseudo-labeling and consistency constraints to harness\nimages with missing labels and to mitigate the domain gap across datasets. From\nproof-of-concept studies on three natural imaging datasets and rigorous\nevaluations on two large-scale thorax X-ray benchmarks, we discover that\nlearning from \"negative examples\" facilitates both classification and\nsegmentation of classes of interest. This sheds new light on the computer-aided\ndiagnosis of rare diseases and emerging pandemics, wherein \"positive examples\"\nare hard to collect, yet \"negative examples\" are relatively easier to assemble.\nAs a result, besides exceeding the prior art in the NIH ChestXray benchmark,\nour model is particularly strong in identifying diseases of minority classes,\nyielding over 3-point improvement on average. Remarkably, when using existing\npartial labels, our model performance is on-par (p>0.05) with that using a\nfully curated dataset with exhaustive labels, eliminating the need for\nadditional 40% annotation costs.",

Although significant efforts have been\ndedicated to addressing this challenge, the effect on the image classification\ntask is still not satisfactory. In this paper, we propose FedProc: prototypical\ncontrastive federated learning, which is a simple and effective federated\nlearning framework. The key idea is to utilize the prototypes as global\nknowledge to correct the local training of each client. We design a local\nnetwork architecture and a global prototypical contrastive loss to regulate the\ntraining of local models, which makes local objectives consistent with the\nglobal optima. Eventually, the converged global model obtains a good\nperformance on non-IID data.

Existing DL-based MIMO detectors, however, suffer several\ndrawbacks. To address these issues, in this paper, we develop a modeldriven DL\ndetector based on variational Bayesian inference. Specifically, the proposed\nunrolled DL architecture is inspired by an inverse-free variational Bayesian\nlearning framework which circumvents matrix inversion via maximizing a relaxed\nevidence lower bound. Two networks are respectively developed for independent\nand identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian channels and arbitrarily\ncorrelated channels. The proposed networks, referred to as VBINet, have only a\nfew learnable parameters and thus can be efficiently trained with a moderate\namount of training samples. The proposed VBINet-based detectors can work in\nboth offline and online training modes. An important advantage of our proposed\nnetworks over state-of-the-art MIMO detection networks such as OAMPNet and\nMMNet is that the VBINet can automatically learn the noise variance from data,\nthus yielding a significant performance improvement over the OAMPNet and MMNet\nin the presence of noise variance uncertainty.

    "abstract": "Complication risk profiling is a key challenge in the healthcare domain due\nto the complex interaction between heterogeneous entities (e.g., visit,\ndisease, medication) in clinical data. With the availability of real-world\nclinical data such as electronic health records and insurance claims, many deep\nlearning methods are proposed for complication risk profiling. However, these\nexisting methods face two open challenges. First, data heterogeneity relates to\nthose methods leveraging clinical data from a single view only while the data\ncan be considered from multiple views (e.g., sequence of clinical visits, set\nof clinical features). Second, generalized prediction relates to most of those\nmethods focusing on single-task learning, whereas each complication onset is\npredicted independently, leading to suboptimal models. We propose a multi-view\nmulti-task network (MuViTaNet) for predicting the onset of multiple\ncomplications to tackle these issues. In particular, MuViTaNet complements\npatient representation by using a multi-view encoder to effectively extract\ninformation by considering clinical data as both sequences of clinical visits\nand sets of clinical features. In addition, it leverages additional information\nfrom both related labeled and unlabeled datasets to generate more generalized\nrepresentations by using a new multi-task learning scheme for making more\naccurate predictions. The experimental results show that MuViTaNet outperforms\nexisting methods for profiling the development of cardiac complications in\nbreast cancer survivors. Furthermore, thanks to its multi-view multi-task\narchitecture, MuViTaNet also provides an effective mechanism for interpreting\nits predictions in multiple perspectives, thereby helping clinicians discover\nthe underlying mechanism triggering the onset and for making better clinical\ntreatments in real-world scenarios.",

    "abstract": "We consider a class of multi-agent optimization problems, where each agent\nhas a local objective function that depends on its own decision variables and\nthe aggregate of others, and is willing to cooperate with other agents to\nminimize the sum of the local objectives. After associating each agent with an\nauxiliary variable and the related local estimates, we conduct primal\ndecomposition to the globally coupled problem and reformulate it so that it can\nbe solved distributedly. Based on the Douglas-Rachford method, an algorithm is\nproposed which ensures the exact convergence to a solution of the original\nproblem. The proposed method enjoys desirable scalability by only requiring\neach agent to keep local estimates that grow linearly with the number of its\nneighbors. We illustrate our proposed algorithm by numerical simulations on a\ncommodity distribution problem over a transport network.",

    "title": "A Novel Patch Convolutional Neural Network for View-based 3D Model  Retrieval",
    "abstract": "Recently, many view-based 3D model retrieval methods have been proposed and\nhave achieved state-of-the-art performance. Most of these methods focus on\nextracting more discriminative view-level features and effectively aggregating\nthe multi-view images of a 3D model, but the latent relationship among these\nmulti-view images is not fully explored. Thus, we tackle this problem from the\nperspective of exploiting the relationships between patch features to capture\nlong-range associations among multi-view images. To capture associations among\nviews, in this work, we propose a novel patch convolutional neural network\n(PCNN) for view-based 3D model retrieval. Specifically, we first employ a CNN\nto extract patch features of each view image separately. Secondly, a novel\nneural network module named PatchConv is designed to exploit intrinsic\nrelationships between neighboring patches in the feature space to capture\nlong-range associations among multi-view images. Then, an adaptive weighted\nview layer is further embedded into PCNN to automatically assign a weight to\neach view according to the similarity between each view feature and the\nview-pooling feature. Finally, a discrimination loss function is employed to\nextract the discriminative 3D model feature, which consists of softmax loss\nvalues generated by the fusion lassifier and the specific classifier. Extensive\nexperimental results on two public 3D model retrieval benchmarks, namely, the\nModelNet40, and ModelNet10, demonstrate that our proposed PCNN can outperform\nstate-of-the-art approaches, with mAP alues of 93.67%, and 96.23%,\nrespectively.",

Among them,\ngrading text answers were divided into short answer grading, and essay grading.\nThe goal of this work was to develop an ML-based short answer grading system. I\nhence built a system which uses finetuning on Roberta Large Model pretrained on\nSTS benchmark dataset and have also created an interface to show the production\nreadiness of the system. I evaluated the performance of the system on the\nMohler extended dataset and SciEntsBank Dataset. The developed system achieved\na Pearsons Correlation of 0.82 and RMSE of 0.7 on the Mohler Dataset which\nbeats the SOTA performance on this dataset which is correlation of 0.805 and\nRMSE of 0.793. Additionally, Pearsons Correlation of 0.79 and RMSE of 0.56 was\nachieved on the SciEntsBank Dataset, which only reconfirms the robustness of\nthe system. A few observations during achieving these results included usage of\nbatch size of 1 produced better results than using batch size of 16 or 32 and\nusing huber loss as loss function performed well on this regression task. The\nsystem was tried and tested on train and validation splits using various random\nseeds and still has been tweaked to achieve a minimum of 0.76 of correlation\nand a maximum 0.15 (out of 1) RMSE on any dataset.",

    "abstract": "Though recent end-to-end neural models have shown promising progress on\nConversational Recommender System (CRS), two key challenges still remain.\nFirst, the recommended items cannot be always incorporated into the generated\nreplies precisely and appropriately. Second, only the items mentioned in the\ntraining corpus have a chance to be recommended in the conversation. To tackle\nthese challenges, we introduce a novel framework called NTRD for recommender\ndialogue system that decouples the dialogue generation from the item\nrecommendation. NTRD has two key components, i.e., response template generator\nand item selector. The former adopts an encoder-decoder model to generate a\nresponse template with slot locations tied to target items, while the latter\nfills in slot locations with the proper items using a sufficient attention\nmechanism. Our approach combines the strengths of both classical slot filling\napproaches (that are generally controllable) and modern neural NLG approaches\n(that are generally more natural and accurate). Extensive experiments on the\nbenchmark ReDial show our NTRD significantly outperforms the previous\nstate-of-the-art methods. Besides, our approach has the unique advantage to\nproduce novel items that do not appear in the training set of dialogue corpus.\nThe code is available at \\url{https://github.com/jokieleung/NTRD}.",

First, we observe a baseline of cosine similarity scores\nbetween topic embeddings from automatic transcriptions and the descriptions of\nthe podcasts written by the podcast creators. We then observe how the cosine\nsimilarities decrease as transcription noise increases and conclude that even\nwhen automatic speech recognition transcripts are erroneous, it is still\npossible to obtain high-quality topic embeddings from the transcriptions.",

    "abstract": "This paper attacks an emerging challenge of multi-modal retinal disease\nrecognition. Given a multi-modal case consisting of a color fundus photo (CFP)\nand an array of OCT B-scan images acquired during an eye examination, we aim to\nbuild a deep neural network that recognizes multiple vision-threatening\ndiseases for the given case. As the diagnostic efficacy of CFP and OCT is\ndisease-dependent, the network's ability of being both selective and\ninterpretable is important. Moreover, as both data acquisition and manual\nlabeling are extremely expensive in the medical domain, the network has to be\nrelatively lightweight for learning from a limited set of labeled multi-modal\nsamples. Prior art on retinal disease recognition focuses either on a single\ndisease or on a single modality, leaving multi-modal fusion largely\nunderexplored. We propose in this paper Multi-Modal Multi-Instance Learning\n(MM-MIL) for selectively fusing CFP and OCT modalities. Its lightweight\narchitecture (as compared to current multi-head attention modules) makes it\nsuited for learning from relatively small-sized datasets. For an effective use\nof MM-MIL, we propose to generate a pseudo sequence of CFPs by over sampling a\ngiven CFP. The benefits of this tactic include well balancing instances across\nmodalities, increasing the resolution of the CFP input, and finding out regions\nof the CFP most relevant with respect to the final diagnosis. Extensive\nexperiments on a real-world dataset consisting of 1,206 multi-modal cases from\n1,193 eyes of 836 subjects demonstrate the viability of the proposed model.",

    "title": "Advances of the Python-based Fluid-Structure Interaction capabilities  included in SU2",
    "abstract": "Current research efforts in aeroelasticity aim at including higher fidelity\naerodynamic results into the simulation frameworks. In the present effort, the\nPython--based Fluid--Structure Interaction framework of the well known SU2 code\nhas been updated and extended to allow for efficient and fully open-source\nsimulations of detailed aeroelastic phenomena. The interface has been\nstandardised for easier inclusion of other external solvers and the\ncomunication scheme between processors revisited. A native solver has been\nintroduced to solve the structural equations coming from a Nastran--like Finite\nElement Model. The use of high level programming allows to perform simulations\nwith ease and minimum human work. On the other hand, the Computational Fluid\nDynamics code of choice has efficient lower level functions that provide a\nquick turnaround time. Further, the aerodynamic code is currently actively\ndeveloped and exhibits interesting features for computational aeroelasticity,\nincluding an effective means of deforming the mesh. The developed software has\nbeen assessed against three different test cases, of increasing complexity. The\nfirst test involved the comparison with analytical results for a\npitching-plunging airfoil. The second tackled a three-dimensional transonic\nwing, comparing experimental results. Finally, an entire wind tunnel test, with\na flexible half-plane model, has been simulated. In all these tests the code\nperformed well, increasing the confidence that it will be useful for a large\nrange of applications, even in industrial settings. The final goal of the\nresearch is to provide with an excellent and free alternative for aeroelastic\nsimulations, that will leverage the use of high-fidelity in the common\npractise.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised person re-identification (Re-ID) is a promising and very\nchallenging research problem in computer vision. Learning robust and\ndiscriminative features with unlabeled data is of central importance to Re-ID.\nRecently, more attention has been paid to unsupervised Re-ID algorithms based\non clustered pseudo-label. However, the previous approaches did not fully\nexploit information of hard samples, simply using cluster centroid or all\ninstances for contrastive learning. In this paper, we propose a Hard-sample\nGuided Hybrid Contrast Learning (HHCL) approach combining cluster-level loss\nwith instance-level loss for unsupervised person Re-ID. Our approach applies\ncluster centroid contrastive loss to ensure that the network is updated in a\nmore stable way. Meanwhile, introduction of a hard instance contrastive loss\nfurther mines the discriminative information. Extensive experiments on two\npopular large-scale Re-ID benchmarks demonstrate that our HHCL outperforms\nprevious state-of-the-art methods and significantly improves the performance of\nunsupervised person Re-ID.

    "abstract": "Model binarization is an effective method of compressing neural networks and\naccelerating their inference process, which enables state-of-the-art models to\nrun on resource-limited devices. However, a significant performance gap still\nexists between the 1-bit model and the 32-bit one. The empirical study shows\nthat binarization causes a great loss of information in the forward and\nbackward propagation which harms the performance of binary neural networks\n(BNNs), and the limited information representation ability of binarized\nparameter is one of the bottlenecks of BNN performance. We present a novel\nDistribution-sensitive Information Retention Network (DIR-Net) to retain the\ninformation of the forward activations and backward gradients, which improves\nBNNs by distribution-sensitive optimization without increasing the overhead in\nthe inference process. The DIR-Net mainly relies on two technical\ncontributions: (1) Information Maximized Binarization (IMB): minimizing the\ninformation loss and the quantization error of weights/activations\nsimultaneously by balancing and standardizing the weight distribution in the\nforward propagation; (2) Distribution-sensitive Two-stage Estimator (DTE):\nminimizing the information loss of gradients by gradual distribution-sensitive\napproximation of the sign function in the backward propagation, jointly\nconsidering the updating capability and accurate gradient. The DIR-Net\ninvestigates both forward and backward processes of BNNs from the unified\ninformation perspective, thereby provides new insight into the mechanism of\nnetwork binarization. Comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet\ndatasets show our DIR-Net consistently outperforms the SOTA binarization\napproaches under mainstream and compact architectures.

    "abstract": "The architecture of deep convolutional networks (CNNs) has evolved for years,\nbecoming more accurate and faster. However, it is still challenging to design\nreasonable network structures that aim at obtaining the best accuracy under a\nlimited computational budget. In this paper, we propose a Tree block, named\nafter its appearance, which extends the One-Shot Aggregation (OSA) module while\nbeing more lightweight and flexible. Specifically, the Tree block replaces each\nof the $3\\times3$ Conv layers in OSA into a stack of shallow residual block\n(SRB) and $1\\times1$ Conv layer. The $1\\times1$ Conv layer is responsible for\ndimension increasing and the SRB is fed into the next step. By doing this, when\naggregating the same number of subsequent feature maps, the Tree block has a\ndeeper network structure while having less model complexity. In addition,\nresidual connection and efficient channel attention(ECA) is added to the Tree\nblock to further improve the performance of the network. Based on the Tree\nblock, we build efficient backbone models calling TreeNets. TreeNet has a\nsimilar network architecture to ResNet, making it flexible to replace ResNet in\nvarious computer vision frameworks. We comprehensively evaluate TreeNet on\ncommon-used benchmarks, including ImageNet-1k for classification, MS COCO for\nobject detection, and instance segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat TreeNet is more efficient and performs favorably against the current\nstate-of-the-art backbone methods.",

    "abstract": "Robustness is key to engineering, automation, and science as a whole.\nHowever, the property of robustness is often underpinned by costly requirements\nsuch as over-provisioning, known uncertainty and predictive models, and known\nadversaries. These conditions are idealistic, and often not satisfiable.\nResilience on the other hand is the capability to endure unexpected\ndisruptions, to recover swiftly from negative events, and bounce back to\nnormality. In this survey article, we analyze how resilience is achieved in\nnetworks of agents and multi-robot systems that are able to overcome adversity\nby leveraging system-wide complementarity, diversity, and redundancy - often\ninvolving a reconfiguration of robotic capabilities to provide some key ability\nthat was not present in the system a priori. As society increasingly depends on\nconnected automated systems to provide key infrastructure services (e.g.,\nlogistics, transport, and precision agriculture), providing the means to\nachieving resilient multi-robot systems is paramount. By enumerating the\nconsequences of a system that is not resilient (fragile), we argue that\nresilience must become a central engineering design consideration. Towards this\ngoal, the community needs to gain clarity on how it is defined, measured, and\nmaintained. We address these questions across foundational robotics domains,\nspanning perception, control, planning, and learning. One of our key\ncontributions is a formal taxonomy of approaches, which also helps us discuss\nthe defining factors and stressors for a resilient system.

    "abstract": "Machine learning models commonly exhibit unexpected failures post-deployment\ndue to either data shifts or uncommon situations in the training environment.\nDomain experts typically go through the tedious process of inspecting the\nfailure cases manually, identifying failure modes and then attempting to fix\nthe model. In this work, we aim to standardise and bring principles to this\nprocess through answering two critical questions: (i) how do we know that we\nhave identified meaningful and distinct failure types?; (ii) how can we\nvalidate that a model has, indeed, been repaired? We suggest that the quality\nof the identified failure types can be validated through measuring the intra-\nand inter-type generalisation after fine-tuning and introduce metrics to\ncompare different subtyping methods. Furthermore, we argue that a model can be\nconsidered repaired if it achieves high accuracy on the failure types while\nretaining performance on the previously correct data. We combine these two\nideas into a principled framework for evaluating the quality of both the\nidentified failure subtypes and model repairment.

In particular, a disturbance-reactive (or disturbance feedback)\ncontroller in the form of a parameterized finite automaton is considered. We\nshow that, for a class of automata, the robust positively invariant sets of the\ncorresponding closed-loop systems can be expressed by a set of linear\ninequality constraints in the joint space of system states and controller\nparameters. This leads to an implicit representation of the invariant set in a\nlifted space.

    "abstract": "There has been a surge of recent interest in Machine Learning (ML),\nparticularly Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based models, to decode muscle\nactivities from surface Electromyography (sEMG) signals for myoelectric control\nof neurorobotic systems. DNN-based models, however, require large training sets\nand, typically, have high structural complexity, i.e., they depend on a large\nnumber of trainable parameters. To address these issues, we developed a\nframework based on the Transformer architecture for processing sEMG signals. We\npropose a novel Vision Transformer (ViT)-based neural network architecture\n(referred to as the TEMGNet) to classify and recognize upperlimb hand gestures\nfrom sEMG to be used for myocontrol of prostheses. The proposed TEMGNet\narchitecture is trained with a small dataset without the need for pre-training\nor fine-tuning. To evaluate the efficacy, following the-recent literature, the\nsecond subset (exercise B) of the NinaPro DB2 dataset was utilized, where the\nproposed TEMGNet framework achieved a recognition accuracy of 82.93% and 82.05%\nfor window sizes of 300ms and 200ms, respectively, outperforming its\nstate-of-the-art counterparts. Moreover, the proposed TEMGNet framework is\nsuperior in terms of structural capacity while having seven times fewer\ntrainable parameters. These characteristics and the high performance make\nDNN-based models promising approaches for myoelectric control of neurorobots.",

    "abstract": "Fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC), which aims at classifying objects\nwith small inter-class variances, has been significantly advanced in recent\nyears. However, ultra-fine-grained visual categorization (ultra-FGVC), which\ntargets at identifying subclasses with extremely similar patterns, has not\nreceived much attention. In ultra-FGVC datasets, the samples per category are\nalways scarce as the granularity moves down, which will lead to overfitting\nproblems. Moreover, the difference among different categories is too subtle to\ndistinguish even for professional experts. Motivated by these issues, this\npaper proposes a novel compositional feature embedding and similarity metric\n(CECS). Specifically, in the compositional feature embedding module, we\nrandomly select patches in the original input image, and these patches are then\nreplaced by patches from the images of different categories or masked out. Then\nthe replaced and masked images are used to augment the original input images,\nwhich can provide more diverse samples and thus largely alleviate overfitting\nproblem resulted from limited training samples. Besides, learning with diverse\nsamples forces the model to learn not only the most discriminative features but\nalso other informative features in remaining regions, enhancing the\ngeneralization and robustness of the model. In the compositional similarity\nmetric module, a new similarity metric is developed to improve the\nclassification performance by narrowing the intra-category distance and\nenlarging the inter-category distance. Experimental results on two ultra-FGVC\ndatasets and one FGVC dataset with recent benchmark methods consistently\ndemonstrate that the proposed CECS method achieves the state of-the-art\nperformance.",

Technically, we address an\ninformation retrieval problem on code evolution history. Given a code\nrepository, we search for regressions where a test can pass a regression-fixing\ncommit, fail a regressioninducing commit, and pass a working commit. In this\nwork, we address the challenges of (1) identifying potential regression-fixing\ncommits from the code evolution history, (2) migrating the test and its code\ndependencies over the history, and (3) minimizing the compilation overhead\nduring the regression search.

    "abstract": "This work proposes a model-reduction approach for the material point method\non nonlinear manifolds. The technique approximates the $\\textit{kinematics}$ by\napproximating the deformation map in a manner that restricts deformation\ntrajectories to reside on a low-dimensional manifold expressed from the\nextrinsic view via a parameterization function. By explicitly approximating the\ndeformation map and its spatial-temporal gradients, the deformation gradient\nand the velocity can be computed simply by differentiating the associated\nparameterization function. Unlike classical model reduction techniques that\nbuild a subspace for a finite number of degrees of freedom, the proposed method\napproximates the entire deformation map with infinite degrees of freedom.\nTherefore, the technique supports resolution changes in the reduced simulation,\nattaining the challenging task of zero-shot super-resolution by generating\nmaterial points unseen in the training data. The ability to generate material\npoints also allows for adaptive quadrature rules for stress update. A family of\nprojection methods is devised to generate $\\textit{dynamics}$, i.e., at every\ntime step, the methods perform three steps: (1) generate quadratures in the\nfull space from the reduced space, (2) compute position and velocity updates in\nthe full space, and (3) perform a least-squares projection of the updated\nposition and velocity onto the low-dimensional manifold and its tangent space.\nComputational speedup is achieved via hyper-reduction, i.e., only a subset of\nthe original material points are needed for dynamics update. Large-scale\nnumerical examples with millions of material points illustrate the method's\nability to gain an order-of-magnitude computational-cost saving -- indeed\n$\\textit{real-time simulations}$ in some cases -- with negligible errors.",

When the views are acquired and stored at\ndifferent locations, organizations and edge devices, computing GCCA in a\ndistributed, parallel and efficient manner is well-motivated. However, existing\ndistributed GCCA algorithms may incur prohitively high communication overhead.\nThis work puts forth a communication-efficient distributed framework for both\nlinear and deep GCCA under the maximum variance (MAX-VAR) paradigm.

The defacto allocation policy used in\nmost of these systems, max-min fairness, guarantees desirable properties like\nincentive compatibility and Pareto efficiency, assuming user demands are\ntime-independent. However, in modern real-world production systems, user\ndemands are dynamic, i.e., vary over time. As a result, there is now a\nfundamental mismatch between the resource allocation goals of computer systems\nand the properties enabled by classic resource allocation policies.\nWe consider a natural generalization of the classic algorithm for max-min\nfair allocation for the case of dynamic demands: this algorithm guarantees\nPareto optimality, while ensuring that allocated resources are as max-min fair\nas possible up to any time instant, given the allocation in previous periods.\nWhile this dynamic allocation scheme remains Pareto optimal, it is not\nincentive compatible. We show that the possible increase in utility by\nmisreporting demand is minimal and since this misreporting can lead to\nsignificant decrease in overall useful allocation, this suggests that it is not\na useful strategy. Our main result is to show that when user demands are random\nvariables, increasing the total amount of resource by a $(1+O(\\epsilon))$\nfactor compared to the sum of expected instantaneous demands, makes the\nalgorithm $(1+\\epsilon)$-incentive compatible: no user can improve her\nallocation by a factor more than $(1+\\epsilon)$ by misreporting demands, where\n$\\epsilon\\to 0$ as $n\\to\\infty$ and $n$ is the number of users. In the\nadversarial setting, we show that this algorithm is $3/2$-incentive compatible,\nwhich is nearly tight.

Dissipating heat produced from computation, memory\naccess remains a significant problem for processors. Therefore, processor\nthermal management continues to be an active research topic. Most thermal\nmanagement research takes place using simulations, given the challenges of\nmeasuring temperature in real processors. Since core and memory are fabricated\non separate packages in most existing processors, with the memory having lower\npower densities, thermal management research in processors has primarily\nfocused on the cores.\nMemory bandwidth limitations associated with 2D processors lead to\nhigh-density 2.5D and 3D packaging technology. 2.5D packaging places cores and\nmemory on the same package. 3D packaging technology takes it further by\nstacking layers of memory on the top of cores themselves. Such packagings\nsignificantly increase the power density, making processors prone to heating.\nTherefore, mitigating thermal issues in high-density processors (packaged with\nstacked memory) becomes an even more pressing problem. However, given the lack\nof thermal modeling for memories in existing interval thermal simulation\ntoolchains, they are unsuitable for studying thermal management for\nhigh-density processors.\nTo address this issue, we present CoMeT, the first integrated Core and Memory\ninterval Thermal simulation toolchain. CoMeT comprehensively supports thermal\nsimulation of high- and low-density processors corresponding to four different\ncore-memory configurations - off-chip DDR memory, off-chip 3D memory, 2.5D, and\n3D. CoMeT supports several novel features that facilitate overlying system\nresearch. Compared to an equivalent state-of-the-art core-only toolchain, CoMeT\nadds only a ~5% simulation-time overhead. The source code of CoMeT has been\nmade open for public use under the MIT license.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that natural language models are vulnerable to adversarial\nattacks, which are mostly input-specific in nature. Recently, it has been shown\nthat there also exist input-agnostic attacks in NLP models, called universal\nadversarial triggers. However, existing methods to craft universal triggers are\ndata intensive. They require large amounts of data samples to generate\nadversarial triggers, which are typically inaccessible by attackers. For\ninstance, previous works take 3000 data samples per class for the SNLI dataset\nto generate adversarial triggers. In this paper, we present a novel data-free\napproach, MINIMAL, to mine input-agnostic adversarial triggers from models.\nUsing the triggers produced with our data-free algorithm, we reduce the\naccuracy of Stanford Sentiment Treebank's positive class from 93.6% to 9.6%.\nSimilarly, for the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI), our single-word\ntrigger reduces the accuracy of the entailment class from 90.95% to less than\n0.6\\%. Despite being completely data-free, we get equivalent accuracy drops as\ndata-dependent methods.",

Multi-orchestrator MEL refers to the coexistence of multiple learning\ntasks with different datasets, each of which being governed by an orchestrator\nto facilitate the distributed training process. In MEL, the training\nperformance deteriorates without the availability of sufficient training data\nor computing resources. Therefore, it is crucial to motivate edge devices to\nbecome learners and offer their computing resources, and either offer their\nprivate data or receive the needed data from the orchestrator and participate\nin the training process of a learning task. In this work, we propose an\nincentive mechanism, where we formulate the orchestrators-learners interactions\nas a 2-round Stackelberg game to motivate the participation of the learners. In\nthe first round, the learners decide which learning task to get engaged in, and\nthen in the second round, the amount of data for training in case of\nparticipation such that their utility is maximized.

For serial\nrobots of this kind, the inverse kinematics problem can be split in two\nsubproblems: the position and orientation problems.

In this paper, we tackle this problem by proposing a\nminority class oversampling scheme, UCLSO, which integrates Unsupervised\nClustering and Label-Specific data Oversampling. Clustering is performed to\nfind out the key distinct and locally connected regions of a multi-label\ndataset (irrespective of the label information). Next, for each label, we\nexplore the distributions of minority points in the cluster sets. Only the\nminority points within a cluster are used to generate the synthetic minority\npoints that are used for oversampling. Even though the cluster set is the same\nacross all labels, the distributions of the synthetic minority points will vary\nacross the labels. The training dataset is augmented with the set of\nlabel-specific synthetic minority points, and classifiers are trained to\npredict the relevance of each label independently.

    "abstract": "Search-based techniques have shown great success in motion planning problems\nsuch as robotic navigation by discretizing the state space and precomputing\nmotion primitives. However in domains with complex dynamic constraints,\nconstructing motion primitives in a discretized state space is non-trivial.\nThis requires operating in continuous space which can be challenging for\nsearch-based planners as they can get stuck in local minima regions. Previous\nwork on planning in continuous spaces introduced soft duplicate detection which\nrequires search to compute the duplicity of a state with respect to previously\nseen states to avoid exploring states that are likely to be duplicates,\nespecially in local minima regions. They propose a simple metric utilizing the\neuclidean distance between states, and proximity to obstacles to compute the\nduplicity. In this paper, we improve upon this metric by introducing a\nkinodynamically informed metric, subtree overlap, between two states as the\nsimilarity between their successors that can be reached within a fixed time\nhorizon using kinodynamic motion primitives. This captures the intuition that,\ndue to robot dynamics, duplicate states can be far in euclidean distance and\nresult in very similar successor states, while non-duplicate states can be\nclose and result in widely different successors.",

There, the DeGroot update on the current states is\nfollowed by a linear combination with the previous states. We propose a\nmodification where the DeGroot update is applied to the current and previous\nstates and is then followed by a linear combination step. We show that this\nsimple modification applied to undirected networks permits convergence even for\nperiodic networks. Further, it allows for faster convergence than the DeGroot\nand accelerated averaging models for suitable networks and model parameters.",

    "abstract": "Smartphones are a crucial aspect of routine life in the modern world, and\nviewing information graphics such as charts becomes common practice for many\nunassuming tasks. However, for the vision impaired, accessing graphical\nmaterial presents many difficulties. Android smartphones usually come\npreinstalled with Google Talkback as a default screen-reader, which attempts to\ncater for the visually impaired by providing supplementary auditory information\nwhen interfacing with supported applications. Still, the crux of this situation\nis that screen-readers rely on developers correctly implementing the required\naccessibility guidelines for UI elements, such as charts. Unfortunately,\naccording to the empirical study, more than 88% of the charts found in\nreal-world Android applications are inaccessible to a vision-impaired user,\ncontributing to the wider accessibility issues faced by vision impaired users\nof smartphones. These accessibility issues can be attributed to a knowledge gap\nin considering possible disabilities for users, and time costs for developers.\nTo overcome these challenges, this study proposes CAM (Chart Accessibility\nModule), which aims to reduce time and bridge the knowledge gap required to\nimplement chart accessibility. CAM has two steps, generating chart summary\nusing raw data and feeding it to the screen-reader using the Android\nAccessibility API for MPAndroidChart library. The user study results show that\nCAM significantly reduces difficulty and time taken to implement accessibility\nfor application developers.",

    "abstract": "Auditing trained deep learning (DL) models prior to deployment is vital in\npreventing unintended consequences. One of the biggest challenges in auditing\nis in understanding how we can obtain human-interpretable specifications that\nare directly useful to the end-user. We address this challenge through a\nsequence of semantically-aligned unit tests, where each unit test verifies\nwhether a predefined specification (e.g., accuracy over 95%) is satisfied with\nrespect to controlled and semantically aligned variations in the input space\n(e.g., in face recognition, the angle relative to the camera). We perform these\nunit tests by directly verifying the semantically aligned variations in an\ninterpretable latent space of a generative model. Our framework, AuditAI,\nbridges the gap between interpretable formal verification and scalability. With\nevaluations on four different datasets, covering images of towers, chest\nX-rays, human faces, and ImageNet classes, we show how AuditAI allows us to\nobtain controlled variations for verification and certified training while\naddressing the limitations of verifying using only pixel-space perturbations.

    "abstract": "In the evasion attacks against deep neural networks (DNN), the attacker\ngenerates adversarial instances that are visually indistinguishable from benign\nsamples and sends them to the target DNN to trigger misclassifications. In this\npaper, we propose a novel multi-view adversarial image detector, namely Argos,\nbased on a novel observation. That is, there exist two \"souls\" in an\nadversarial instance, i.e., the visually unchanged content, which corresponds\nto the true label, and the added invisible perturbation, which corresponds to\nthe misclassified label. Such inconsistencies could be further amplified\nthrough an autoregressive generative approach that generates images with seed\npixels selected from the original image, a selected label, and pixel\ndistributions learned from the training data. The generated images (i.e., the\n\"views\") will deviate significantly from the original one if the label is\nadversarial, demonstrating inconsistencies that Argos expects to detect. To\nthis end, Argos first amplifies the discrepancies between the visual content of\nan image and its misclassified label induced by the attack using a set of\nregeneration mechanisms and then identifies an image as adversarial if the\nreproduced views deviate to a preset degree. Our experimental results show that\nArgos significantly outperforms two representative adversarial detectors in\nboth detection accuracy and robustness against six well-known adversarial\nattacks.

We articulate the\nconcept of EPs by demarcating it from dark patterns and highlighting the\nchallenges arising from uncertainties around pitfalls. We situate and\noperationalize the concept using a case study that showcases how, despite best\nintentions, unsuspecting negative effects such as unwarranted trust in\nnumerical explanations can emerge. We propose proactive and preventative\nstrategies to address EPs at three interconnected levels: research, design, and\norganizational.",

    "title": "Physics-informed Convolutional Neural Networks for Temperature Field  Prediction of Heat Source Layout without Labeled Data",
    "abstract": "Recently, surrogate models based on deep learning have attracted much\nattention for engineering analysis and optimization. As the construction of\ndata pairs in most engineering problems is time-consuming, data acquisition is\nbecoming the predictive capability bottleneck of most deep surrogate models,\nwhich also exists in surrogate for thermal analysis and design. To address this\nissue, this paper develops a physics-informed convolutional neural network\n(CNN) for the thermal simulation surrogate. The network can learn a mapping\nfrom heat source layout to the steady-state temperature field without labeled\ndata, which equals solving an entire family of partial difference equations\n(PDEs). To realize the physics-guided training without labeled data, we employ\nthe heat conduction equation and finite difference method to construct the loss\nfunction. Since the solution is sensitive to boundary conditions, we properly\nimpose hard constraints by padding in the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary\nconditions. In addition, the neural network architecture is well-designed to\nimprove the prediction precision of the problem at hand, and pixel-level online\nhard example mining is introduced to overcome the imbalance of optimization\ndifficulty in the computation domain. The experiments demonstrate that the\nproposed method can provide comparable predictions with numerical method and\ndata-driven deep learning models. We also conduct various ablation studies to\ninvestigate the effectiveness of the network component and training methods\nproposed in this paper.",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised methods play an increasingly important role in monocular\ndepth estimation due to their great potential and low annotation cost. To close\nthe gap with supervised methods, recent works take advantage of extra\nconstraints, e.g., semantic segmentation. However, these methods will\ninevitably increase the burden on the model. In this paper, we show theoretical\nand empirical evidence that the potential capacity of self-supervised monocular\ndepth estimation can be excavated without increasing this cost. In particular,\nwe propose (1) a novel data augmentation approach called data grafting, which\nforces the model to explore more cues to infer depth besides the vertical image\nposition, (2) an exploratory self-distillation loss, which is supervised by the\nself-distillation label generated by our new post-processing method - selective\npost-processing, and (3) the full-scale network, designed to endow the encoder\nwith the specialization of depth estimation task and enhance the\nrepresentational power of the model. Extensive experiments show that our\ncontributions can bring significant performance improvement to the baseline\nwith even less computational overhead, and our model, named EPCDepth, surpasses\nthe previous state-of-the-art methods even those supervised by additional\nconstraints.",

    "abstract": "Many nonlocal models have adopted a finite and radially symmetric nonlocal\ninteraction domains. When solving them numerically, it is sometimes convenient\nto adopt polygonal approximations of such interaction domains. A crucial\nquestion is, to what extent such approximations affect the nonlocal operators\nand the corresponding nonlocal solutions. While recent works have analyzed this\nissue for nonlocal operators in the case of a fixed horizon parameter, the\nquestion remains open in the case of a small or vanishing horizon parameter,\nwhich happens often in many practical applications and has significant impact\non the reliability and robustness of nonlocal modeling and simulations. In this\nwork, we are interested in addressing this issue and establishing the\nconvergence of new nonlocal solutions by polygonal approximations to the local\nlimit of the original nonlocal solutions. Our finding reveals that the new\nnonlocal solution does not converge to the correct local limit when the number\nof sides of polygons is uniformly bounded.

To address\nthese challenges, we propose Constrained BART (CBART) for lexically constrained\ntext generation. CBART leverages the pre-trained model BART and transfers part\nof the generation burden from the decoder to the encoder by decomposing this\ntask into two sub-tasks, thereby improving the sentence quality. Concretely, we\nextend BART by adding a token-level classifier over the encoder, aiming at\ninstructing the decoder where to replace and insert. Guided by the encoder, the\ndecoder refines multiple tokens of the input in one step by inserting tokens\nbefore specific positions and re-predicting tokens with low confidence. To\nfurther reduce the inference latency, the decoder predicts all tokens in\nparallel.

However,\napplying these methods to translate images to multiple visual domains remains\nchallenging. Existing works do not often preserve the domain-invariant part of\nthe image (e.g., the identity in human face translations), they do not usually\nhandle multiple domains, or do not allow for multi-modal translations.

    "abstract": "Image reconstruction from undersampled k-space data plays an important role\nin accelerating the acquisition of MR data, and a lot of deep learning-based\nmethods have been exploited recently. Despite the achieved inspiring results,\nthe optimization of these methods commonly relies on the fully-sampled\nreference data, which are time-consuming and difficult to collect. To address\nthis issue, we propose a novel self-supervised learning method. Specifically,\nduring model optimization, two subsets are constructed by randomly selecting\npart of k-space data from the undersampled data and then fed into two parallel\nreconstruction networks to perform information recovery. Two reconstruction\nlosses are defined on all the scanned data points to enhance the network's\ncapability of recovering the frequency information.

In this way, the\nreconstruction model can be properly trained with only the undersampled data.\nDuring the model evaluation, the undersampled data are treated as the inputs\nand either of the two trained networks is expected to reconstruct the\nhigh-quality results. The proposed method is flexible and can be employed in\nany existing deep learning-based method. The effectiveness of the method is\nevaluated on an open brain MRI dataset.

To\nbe specific, we first consider various dependency types between item nodes and\nperform dependency-aware heterogeneous attention for denoising and obtaining\naccurate sequence item representations. Secondly, for multiple interests\nextraction, multi-head attention is conducted on top of the graph embedding. To\nfilter out noisy inter-item correlations and enhance the robustness of\nextracted interests, self-supervised interest learning is introduced to the\nabove two steps. Thirdly, to aggregate the multiple interests, interest experts\ncorresponding to different interest routes give rating scores respectively,\nwhile a specialized network assigns the confidence of each score.

To validate the proposed method,\ncomprehensive experiments on two rotating machinery datasets have been\nconducted to predict the RUL. The experimental results show that the proposed\nfeature extraction method can effectively predict the RUL and outperforms the\nconventional RUL prediction approaches based on deep neural networks.

Benefiting from\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs), recent studies have promoted the\ndevelopment of SISR by recovering photo-realistic images. However, there are\nstill undesired structural distortions in the recovered images. In this paper,\nwe propose a structure-preserving super-resolution (SPSR) method to alleviate\nthe above issue while maintaining the merits of GAN-based methods to generate\nperceptual-pleasant details. Firstly, we propose SPSR with gradient guidance\n(SPSR-G) by exploiting gradient maps of images to guide the recovery in two\naspects. On the one hand, we restore high-resolution gradient maps by a\ngradient branch to provide additional structure priors for the SR process. On\nthe other hand, we propose a gradient loss to impose a second-order restriction\non the super-resolved images, which helps generative networks concentrate more\non geometric structures. Secondly, since the gradient maps are handcrafted and\nmay only be able to capture limited aspects of structural information, we\nfurther extend SPSR-G by introducing a learnable neural structure extractor\n(NSE) to unearth richer local structures and provide stronger supervision for\nSR. We propose two self-supervised structure learning methods, contrastive\nprediction and solving jigsaw puzzles, to train the NSEs. Our methods are\nmodel-agnostic, which can be potentially used for off-the-shelf SR networks.\nExperimental results on five benchmark datasets show that the proposed methods\noutperform state-of-the-art perceptual-driven SR methods under LPIPS, PSNR, and\nSSIM metrics.

Based on this dynamic access model, a Stackelberg differential\ngame based cloud computing resource sharing mechanism is proposed to facilitate\nthe resource trading between the cloud computing service provider (CCP) and\ndifferent edge computing service providers (ECPs). Then we derive the optimal\npricing and allocation strategies of cloud computing resource based on the\nreplicator dynamics of users' service selection. These strategies can promise\nthe maximum integral utilities to all computing service providers (CPs),\nmeanwhile the user distribution can reach the evolutionary stable state at this\nStackelberg equilibrium. Furthermore, simulation results validate the\nperformance of the designed resource sharing mechanism, and reveal the\nconvergence and equilibrium states of user selection, and computing resource\npricing and allocation.",

    "abstract": "Learning-based methods have achieved great success on single image dehazing\nin recent years. However, these methods are often subject to performance\ndegradation when domain shifts are confronted. Specifically, haze density gaps\nexist among the existing datasets, often resulting in poor performance when\nthese methods are tested across datasets. To address this issue, we propose a\ndensity-aware data augmentation method (DAMix) that generates synthetic hazy\nsamples according to the haze density level of the target domain. These samples\nare generated by combining a hazy image with its corresponding ground truth by\na combination ratio sampled from a density-aware distribution. They not only\ncomply with the atmospheric scattering model but also bridge the haze density\ngap between the source and target domains. DAMix ensures that the model learns\nfrom examples featuring diverse haze densities. To better utilize the various\nhazy samples generated by DAMix, we develop a dual-branch dehazing network\ninvolving two branches that can adaptively remove haze according to the haze\ndensity of the region. In addition, the dual-branch design enlarges the\nlearning capacity of the entire network; hence, our network can fully utilize\nthe DAMix-ed samples. We evaluate the effectiveness of DAMix by applying it to\nthe existing open-source dehazing methods. The experimental results demonstrate\nthat all methods show significant improvements after DAMix is applied.\nFurthermore, by combining DAMix with our model, we can achieve state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) performance in terms of domain adaptation.",

Whilst\nincreasingly stringent regulations have been applied over the years to prevent\nmoney laundering in gambling, despite this, online gambling is still a channel\nfor criminals to spend proceeds from crime. Complementing online gambling's\ngrowth more concerns are raised to its effects compared with gambling in\ntraditional, physical formats, as it might introduce higher levels of problem\ngambling or fraudulent behaviour due to its nature of immediate interaction\nwith online gambling experience. However, in most cases the main issue when\norganisations try to tackle those areas is the absence of high quality data.\nSince fraud detection related issues face the significant problem of the class\nimbalance, in this paper we propose a novel system based on Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GANs) for generating synthetic data in order to train a\nsupervised classifier.

Human consciousness and decision-making\ncapabilities are negatively influenced by manipulated, fabricated, biased or\nunverified news posts. Therefore, there is a high demand for designing veracity\nanalysis systems to detect fake information contents in multiple data\nmodalities. In an attempt to find a sophisticated solution to this critical\nissue, we proposed an architecture to consider both the textual and visual\nattributes of the data. After the data pre-processing is done, text and image\nfeatures are extracted from the training data using separate deep learning\nmodels. Feature extraction from text is done using BERT and ALBERT language\nmodels that leverage the benefits of bidirectional training of transformers\nusing a deep self-attention mechanism. The Inception-ResNet-v2 deep neural\nnetwork model is employed for image data to perform the task. The proposed\nframework focused on two independent multi-modal fusion architectures of BERT\nand Inception-ResNet-v2 as well as ALBERT and Inception-ResNet-v2. Multi-modal\nfusion of textual and visual branches is extensively experimented and analysed\nusing concatenation of feature vectors and weighted averaging of probabilities\nnamed as Early Fusion and Late Fusion respectively. Three publicly available\nbroadly accepted datasets All Data, Weibo and MediaEval 2016 that incorporates\nEnglish news articles, Chinese news articles, and Tweets correspondingly are\nused so that our designed framework's outcomes can be properly tested and\ncompared with previous notable work in the domain.",

While recent works exploited task-specific feature\nembedding using meta-tasks for few-shot learning, they are limited in many\nchallenging tasks as being distracted by the excursive features such as the\nbackground, domain and style of the image samples. In this work, we propose a\nnovel Disentangled Feature Representation framework, dubbed DFR, for few-shot\nlearning applications. DFR can adaptively decouple the discriminative features\nthat are modeled by the classification branch, from the class-irrelevant\ncomponent of the variation branch. In general, most of the popular deep\nfew-shot learning methods can be plugged in as the classification branch, thus\nDFR can boost their performance on various few-shot tasks. Furthermore, we\npropose a novel FS-DomainNet dataset based on DomainNet, for benchmarking the\nfew-shot domain generalization tasks. We conducted extensive experiments to\nevaluate the proposed DFR on general and fine-grained few-shot classification,\nas well as few-shot domain generalization, using the corresponding four\nbenchmarks, i.e., mini-ImageNet, tiered-ImageNet, CUB, as well as the proposed\nFS-DomainNet.

To overcome communication limitations, the\ncontroller schedules the transmissions and generates sequential predictive\ncommands for control. Using elements of stochastic systems theory, we derive a\nsufficient stability condition of the WNCS, which is stated in terms of both\nthe control and communication system parameters. Once the condition is\nsatisfied, there exists at least one stationary and deterministic scheduling\npolicy that can stabilize all plants of the WNCS. By analyzing and representing\nthe per-step cost function of the WNCS in terms of a finite-length countable\nvector state, we formulate the optimal transmission scheduling problem into a\nMarkov decision process problem and develop a deep-reinforcement-learning-based\nalgorithm for solving it.

In this paper, we present a method based on the Bayesian\npropensity score matching framework, applied in the unique setting of\nautomotive software engineering.

In our work, we assess the\nperformance of models for machine translation, across multiple language pairs\nto assess the difference in computational power required to train these models\nfor each of these language pairs and examine the various components of these\nmodels to analyze aspects of our pipeline that can be optimized to reduce these\ncarbon emissions.",

    "abstract": "For the lack of adequate paired noisy-clean speech corpus in many real\nscenarios, non-parallel training is a promising task for DNN-based speech\nenhancement methods. However, because of the severe mismatch between input and\ntarget speech, many previous studies only focus on magnitude spectrum\nestimation and remain the phase unaltered, resulting in the degraded speech\nquality under low signal-to-noise ratio conditions. To tackle this problem, we\ndecouple the difficult target $\\emph{w.r.t.}$ original spectrum optimization\ninto spectral magnitude and phase, and propose a novel Cycle-in-cycle\ngenerative adversarial network (dubbed CinCGAN) to jointly estimate the\nspectral magnitude and phase information stage by stage. In the first stage, we\npretrain a magnitude CycleGAN to coarsely denoise the spectral magnitude\nspectrum. In the second stage, we couple the pretrained CycleGAN with a\ncomplex-valued CycleGAN as a cycle-in-cycle structure to recover phase\ninformation and refine the spectral magnitude simultaneously. The experimental\nresults on the VoiceBank + Demand show that the proposed approach significantly\noutperforms previous baselines under non-parallel training. Experiments on\ntraining the models with standard paired data also show that the proposed\nmethod can achieve remarkable performance.",

    "abstract": "Learning sentence embeddings from dialogues has drawn increasing attention\ndue to its low annotation cost and high domain adaptability. Conventional\napproaches employ the siamese-network for this task, which obtains the sentence\nembeddings through modeling the context-response semantic relevance by applying\na feed-forward network on top of the sentence encoders. However, as the\nsemantic textual similarity is commonly measured through the element-wise\ndistance metrics (e.g. cosine and L2 distance), such architecture yields a\nlarge gap between training and evaluating. In this paper, we propose\nDialogueCSE, a dialogue-based contrastive learning approach to tackle this\nissue. DialogueCSE first introduces a novel matching-guided embedding (MGE)\nmechanism, which generates a context-aware embedding for each candidate\nresponse embedding (i.e. the context-free embedding) according to the guidance\nof the multi-turn context-response matching matrices. Then it pairs each\ncontext-aware embedding with its corresponding context-free embedding and\nfinally minimizes the contrastive loss across all pairs. We evaluate our model\non three multi-turn dialogue datasets: the Microsoft Dialogue Corpus, the Jing\nDong Dialogue Corpus, and the E-commerce Dialogue Corpus. Evaluation results\nshow that our approach significantly outperforms the baselines across all three\ndatasets in terms of MAP and Spearman's correlation measures, demonstrating its\neffectiveness.

The learning of a CF model generally depends on three\nmajor components, namely interaction encoder, loss function, and negative\nsampling. While many existing studies focus on the design of more powerful\ninteraction encoders, the impacts of loss functions and negative sampling\nratios have not yet been well explored. In this work, we show that the choice\nof loss function as well as negative sampling ratio is equivalently important.\nMore specifically, we propose the cosine contrastive loss (CCL) and further\nincorporate it to a simple unified CF model, dubbed SimpleX. Extensive\nexperiments have been conducted on 11 benchmark datasets and compared with 29\nexisting CF models in total. Surprisingly, the results show that, under our CCL\nloss and a large negative sampling ratio, SimpleX can surpass most\nsophisticated state-of-the-art models by a large margin (e.g., max 48.5%\nimprovement in NDCG@20 over LightGCN).

    "abstract": "Medical image segmentation is inherently uncertain. For a given image, there\nmay be multiple plausible segmentation hypotheses, and physicians will often\ndisagree on lesion and organ boundaries. To be suited to real-world\napplication, automatic segmentation systems must be able to capture this\nuncertainty and variability. Thus far, this has been addressed by building deep\nlearning models that, through dropout, multiple heads, or variational\ninference, can produce a set - infinite, in some cases - of plausible\nsegmentation hypotheses for any given image. However, in clinical practice, it\nmay not be practical to browse all hypotheses. Furthermore, recent work shows\nthat segmentation variability plateaus after a certain number of independent\nannotations, suggesting that a large enough group of physicians may be able to\nrepresent the whole space of possible segmentations. Inspired by this, we\npropose a simple method to obtain soft labels from the annotations of multiple\nphysicians and train models that, for each image, produce a single\nwell-calibrated output that can be thresholded at multiple confidence levels,\naccording to each application's precision-recall requirements. We evaluated our\nmethod on the MICCAI 2021 QUBIQ challenge, showing that it performs well across\nmultiple medical image segmentation tasks, produces well-calibrated\npredictions, and, on average, performs better at matching physicians'\npredictions than other physicians.",

The algorithm can be doubly pipelined\nto exploit bidirectional (telephone-like) communication capabilities of the\ncommunication system. In order to make the algorithm more symmetric, the\nprocessors are organized into two rooted trees with communication between the\ntwo roots. For each pipeline block, each non-leaf processor takes three\ncommunication steps, consisting in receiving and sending from and to the two\nchildren, and sending and receiving to and from the root. In a round-based,\nuniform, linear-cost communication model in which simultaneously sending and\nreceiving $n$ data elements takes time $\\alpha+\\beta n$ for system dependent\nconstants $\\alpha$ (communication start-up latency) and $\\beta$ (time per\nelement), the time for the allreduce operation on vectors of $m$ elements is\n$O(\\log p+\\sqrt{m\\log p})+3\\beta m$ by suitable choice of the pipeline block\nsize.

    "abstract": "There is a soaring interest in the news recommendation research scenario due\nto the information overload.

Besides, existing research\npays little attention to the click decision-making process in designing\nmulti-modal modeling modules. In this work, inspired by the fact that users\nmake their click decisions mostly based on the visual impression they perceive\nwhen browsing news, we propose to capture such visual impression information\nwith visual-semantic modeling for news recommendation. Specifically, we devise\nthe local impression modeling module to simultaneously attend to decomposed\ndetails in the impression when understanding the semantic meaning of news\ntitle, which could explicitly get close to the process of users reading news.\nIn addition, we inspect the impression from a global view and take structural\ninformation, such as the arrangement of different fields and spatial position\nof different words on the impression, into the modeling of multiple modalities.\nTo accommodate the research of visual impression-aware news recommendation, we\nextend the text-dominated news recommendation dataset MIND by adding snapshot\nimpression images and will release it to nourish the research field. Extensive\ncomparisons with the state-of-the-art news recommenders along with the in-depth\nanalyses demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and the promising\ncapability of modeling visual impressions for the content-based recommenders.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary question answering (QA) systems, including transformer-based\narchitectures, suffer from increasing computational and model complexity which\nrender them inefficient for real-world applications with limited resources.\nFurther, training or even fine-tuning such models requires a vast amount of\nlabeled data which is often not available for the task at hand. In this\nmanuscript, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the mentioned challenges and\nintroduce suitable countermeasures. We propose a novel knowledge distillation\n(KD) approach to reduce the parameter and model complexity of a pre-trained\nBERT system and utilize multiple active learning (AL) strategies for immense\nreduction in annotation efforts. In particular, we demonstrate that our model\nachieves the performance of a 6-layer TinyBERT and DistilBERT, whilst using\nonly 2% of their total parameters. Finally, by the integration of our AL\napproaches into the BERT framework, we show that state-of-the-art results on\nthe SQuAD dataset can be achieved when we only use 20% of the training data.",

    "abstract": "Multiserver queueing systems are found at the core of a wide variety of\npractical systems. Unfortunately, existing tools for analyzing multiserver\nmodels have major limitations: Techniques for exact analysis often struggle\nwith high-dimensional models, while techniques for deriving bounds are often\ntoo specialized to handle realistic system features, such as variable service\nrates of jobs. New techniques are needed to handle these complex, important,\nhigh-dimensional models.\nIn this paper we introduce the work-conserving finite-skip class of models.\nThis class includes many important models, such as the heterogeneous M/G/k, the\nlimited processor sharing policy for the M/G/1, the threshold parallelism\nmodel, and the multiserver-job model under a simple scheduling policy.\nWe prove upper and lower bounds on mean response time for any model in the\nwork-conserving finite-skip class. Our bounds are separated by an additive\nconstant, giving a strong characterization of mean response time at all loads.\nWhen specialized to each of the models above, these bounds represent the first\nbounds on mean response time known for each setting.",

In particular, we\npropose a new control pipeline, wherein the high-level trajectory modulator\nshapes the end-foot ellipsoidal trajectories, and the low-level gait controller\nregulates the torso and ankle orientation. The foot-trajectory modulator uses a\nlinear policy and the regulator uses a linear PD control law. As opposed to\nneural network-based policies, the proposed linear policy has only 13 learnable\nparameters, thereby not only guaranteeing sample efficient learning but also\nenabling simplicity and interpretability of the policy. This is achieved with\nno loss of performance on challenging terrains like slopes, stairs and outdoor\nlandscapes. We first demonstrate robust walking in the custom simulation\nenvironment, MuJoCo, and then directly transfer to hardware with no\nmodification of the control pipeline.

The agents are initially\nplaced at the origin of the line and can move with any speed up to the maximum\nspeed $1$ in any direction they wish and they all can communicate when they are\nco-located. However, the agents have different wireless communication\nabilities: while some are fully wireless and can send and receive messages at\nany distance, a subset of the agents are senders, they can only transmit\nmessages wirelessly, and the rest are receivers, they can only receive messages\nwirelessly. The agents start at the same time and their communication abilities\nare known to each other from the start. Starting at the origin of the line, the\ngoal of the agents is to collectively find a target/exit at an unknown location\non the line while minimizing the evacuation time, defined as the time when the\nlast agent reaches the target.\nWe investigate the impact of such a mixed communication model on evacuation\ntime on an infinite line for a group of cooperating agents. In particular, we\nprovide evacuation algorithms and analyze the resulting competitive ratio\n($CR$) of the evacuation time for such a group of agents. If the group has two\nagents of two different types, we give an optimal evacuation algorithm with\ncompetitive ratio $CR=3+2 \\sqrt{2}$.

    "abstract": "The ability of Variational Autoencoders to learn disentangled representations\nhas made them appealing for practical applications. However, their mean\nrepresentations, which are generally used for downstream tasks, have recently\nbeen shown to be more correlated than their sampled counterpart, on which\ndisentanglement is usually measured. In this paper, we refine this observation\nthrough the lens of selective posterior collapse, which states that only a\nsubset of the learned representations, the active variables, is encoding useful\ninformation while the rest (the passive variables) is discarded. We first\nextend the existing definition, originally proposed for sampled\nrepresentations, to mean representations and show that active variables are\nequally disentangled in both representations. Based on this new definition and\nthe pre-trained models from disentanglement lib, we then isolate the passive\nvariables and show that they are responsible for the discrepancies between mean\nand sampled representations. Specifically, passive variables exhibit high\ncorrelation scores with other variables in mean representations while being\nfully uncorrelated in sampled ones. We thus conclude that despite what their\nhigher correlation might suggest, mean representations are still good\ncandidates for downstream tasks applications. However, it may be beneficial to\nremove their passive variables, especially when used with models sensitive to\ncorrelated features.",

    "abstract": "Deterministic approaches using iterative optimisation have been historically\nsuccessful in diffeomorphic image registration (DiffIR). Although these\napproaches are highly accurate, they typically carry a significant\ncomputational burden. Recent developments in stochastic approaches based on\ndeep learning have achieved sub-second runtimes for DiffIR with competitive\nregistration accuracy, offering a fast alternative to conventional iterative\nmethods. In this paper, we attempt to reduce this difference in speed whilst\nretaining the performance advantage of iterative approaches in DiffIR. We first\npropose a simple iterative scheme that functionally composes intermediate\nnon-stationary velocity fields to handle large deformations in images whilst\nguaranteeing diffeomorphisms in the resultant deformation. We then propose a\nconvex optimisation model that uses a regularisation term of arbitrary order to\nimpose smoothness on these velocity fields and solve this model with a fast\nalgorithm that combines Nesterov gradient descent and the alternating direction\nmethod of multipliers (ADMM). Finally, we leverage the computational power of\nGPU to implement this accelerated ADMM solver on a 3D cardiac MRI dataset,\nfurther reducing runtime to less than 2 seconds. In addition to producing\nstrictly diffeomorphic deformations, our methods outperform both\nstate-of-the-art deep learning-based and iterative DiffIR approaches in terms\nof dice and Hausdorff scores, with speed approaching the inference time of deep\nlearning-based methods.",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art techniques for addressing scaling-related main memory errors\nidentify and repair bits that are at risk of error from within the memory\ncontroller. Unfortunately, modern main memory chips internally use on-die error\ncorrecting codes (on-die ECC) that obfuscate the memory controller's view of\nerrors, complicating the process of identifying at-risk bits (i.e., error\nprofiling). To understand the problems that on-die ECC causes for error\nprofiling, we analytically study how on-die ECC changes the way that memory\nerrors appear outside of the memory chip (e.g., to the memory controller). We\nshow that on-die ECC introduces statistical dependence between errors in\ndifferent bit positions, raising three key challenges for practical and\neffective error profiling.\nTo address the three challenges, we introduce Hybrid Active-Reactive\nProfiling (HARP), a new error profiling algorithm that rapidly achieves full\ncoverage of at-risk bits in memory chips that use on-die ECC. HARP separates\nerror profiling into two phases: (1) using existing profiling techniques with\nthe help of small modifications to the on-die ECC mechanism to quickly identify\na subset of at-risk bits; and (2) using a secondary ECC within the memory\ncontroller to safely identify the remaining at-risk bits, if and when they\nfail. Our evaluations show that HARP achieves full coverage of all at-risk bits\nfaster (e.g., 99th-percentile coverage 20.6%/36.4%/52.9%/62.1% faster, on\naverage, given 2/3/4/5 raw bit errors per ECC word) than two state-of-the-art\nbaseline error profiling algorithms, which sometimes fail to achieve full\ncoverage. We perform a case study of how each profiler impacts the system's\noverall bit error rate (BER) when using a repair mechanism to tolerate DRAM\ndata-retention errors. We show that HARP outperforms the best baseline\nalgorithm (e.g., by 3.7x for a raw per-bit error probability of 0.75).",

To meet these\nchallenges, we introduce a simple and extensible model that combines an\nautoregressive language model utilizing constrained attribute generation with a\ndiscriminative reranker.

    "abstract": "Demonstrating the veracity of videos is a longstanding problem that has\nrecently become more urgent and acute. It is extremely hard to accurately\ndetect manipulated videos using content analysis, especially in the face of\nsubtle, yet effective, manipulations, such as frame rate changes or skin tone\nadjustments. One prominent alternative to content analysis is to securely embed\nprovenance information into videos. However, prior approaches have poor\nperformance and/or granularity that is too coarse. To this end, we construct\nVronicle -- a video provenance system that offers fine-grained provenance\ninformation and substantially better performance. It allows a video consumer to\nauthenticate the camera that originated the video and the exact sequence of\nvideo filters that were subsequently applied to it. Vronicle exploits the\nincreasing popularity and availability of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)\non many types of computing platforms.\nOne contribution of Vronicle is the design of provenance information that\nallows the consumer to verify various aspects of the video, thereby defeating\nnumerous fake-video creation methods. Vronicle's adversarial model allows for a\npowerful adversary that can manipulate the video (e.g., in transit) and the\nsoftware state outside the TEE. Another contribution is the use of\nfixed-function Intel SGX enclaves to post-process videos. This design\nfacilitates verification of provenance information.\nWe present a prototype implementation of Vronicle (to be open sourced), which\nrelies on current technologies, making it readily deployable. Our evaluation\ndemonstrates that Vronicle's performance is well-suited for offline use-cases.",

The group's access to\nresources, obtained from its members, is traded off against the geographic\ndispersion of the group: spread-out groups are more costly to maintain. We seek\nto understand the stability and structure of such partitions. We define two\ntypes of equilibria: Acceptance Equilibria (AE), in which no agent will\nunilaterally change group affiliation, either because the agent cannot increase\nher utility by switching, or because the intended receiving group is unwilling\nto accept her (i.e., the utility of existing members would decrease if she\njoined); and Strong Acceptance Equilibria (SAE), in which no subset of any\ngroup will change group affiliations (move together) for the same reasons given\nabove.

Our framework reveals new insights: (1) both the absolute performance\nand relative gap of the methods were not accurately estimated in prior\nliterature; (2) no single method dominates most tasks with consistent\nperformance; (3) improvements of some methods diminish with a larger pretrained\nmodel; and (4) gains from different methods are often complementary and the\nbest combined model performs close to a strong fully-supervised baseline. We\nopen-source our toolkit, FewNLU, that implements our evaluation framework along\nwith a number of state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "When faced with distribution shift at test time, deep neural networks often\nmake inaccurate predictions with unreliable uncertainty estimates. While\nimproving the robustness of neural networks is one promising approach to\nmitigate this issue, an appealing alternate to robustifying networks against\nall possible test-time shifts is to instead directly adapt them to unlabeled\ninputs from the particular distribution shift we encounter at test time.\nHowever, this poses a challenging question: in the standard Bayesian model for\nsupervised learning, unlabeled inputs are conditionally independent of model\nparameters when the labels are unobserved, so what can unlabeled data tell us\nabout the model parameters at test-time? In this paper, we derive a Bayesian\nmodel that provides for a well-defined relationship between unlabeled inputs\nunder distributional shift and model parameters, and show how approximate\ninference in this model can be instantiated with a simple regularized entropy\nminimization procedure at test-time. We evaluate our method on a variety of\ndistribution shifts for image classification, including image corruptions,\nnatural distribution shifts, and domain adaptation settings, and show that our\nmethod improves both accuracy and uncertainty estimation.",

In this paper, we argue,\nusing the example of the ``Look and Say\" puzzle, that although deep neural\nnetworks can exhibit high `competence' (as measured by accuracy) when trained\non large data sets (2M examples in our case), they do not show any sign on the\ndeeper understanding of the problem, or what D.

We\napply both standard LSTMs and Transformer/Attention -- based neural networks,\nusing publicly available machine translation software. We observe that despite\nthe amazing accuracy (on both, training and test data), the performance of the\ntrained programs on the actual L\\&S sequence is bad. We then discuss a few\npossible ramifications of this finding and connections to other work,\nexperimental and theoretical. First, from the cognitive science perspective, we\nargue that we need better mathematical models of abstraction. Second, the\nclassical and more recent results on the universality of neural networks should\nbe re-examined for functions acting on discrete data sets. Mapping on discrete\nsets usually have no natural continuous extensions. This connects the results\non a simple puzzle to more sophisticated results on modeling of mathematical\nfunctions, where algebraic functions are more difficult to model than e.g.\ndifferential equations. Third, we hypothesize that for problems such as ``Look\nand Say\", computing the parity of bitstrings, or learning integer addition, it\nmight be worthwhile to introduce concepts from topology, where continuity is\ndefined without the reference to the concept of distance.",

Many volcanoes do not have continuous ground monitoring networks;\nmeaning that satellite observations provide the only record of volcanic\nbehavior and unrest. Among these remote sensing observations, thermal imagery\nis inspected daily by volcanic observatories for examining the early signs,\nonset, and evolution of eruptive activity. However, thermal scenes are often\nobstructed by clouds, meaning that forecasts must be made off image sequences\nwhose scenes are only usable intermittently through time. Here, we explore\nforecasting this thermal data stream from a deep learning perspective using\nexisting architectures that model sequences with varying spatiotemporal\nconsiderations. Additionally, we propose and evaluate new architectures that\nexplicitly model intermittent image sequences. Using ASTER Kinetic Surface\nTemperature data for $9$ volcanoes between $1999$ and $2020$, we found that a\nproposed architecture (ConvLSTM + Time-LSTM + U-Net) forecasts volcanic\ntemperature imagery with the lowest RMSE ($4.164^{\\circ}$C, other methods:\n$4.217-5.291^{\\circ}$C). Additionally, we examined performance on multiple time\nseries derived from the thermal imagery and the effect of training with data\nfrom singular volcanoes. Ultimately, we found that models with the lowest RMSE\non forecasting imagery did not possess the lowest RMSE on recreating time\nseries derived from that imagery and that training with individual volcanoes\ngenerally worsened performance relative to a multi-volcano data set.

    "abstract": "Motivated by the problem of learning when the number of training samples is\nsmall, this paper shows how to incorporate into support-vector machines (SVMs)\nthose properties that have made convolutional neural networks (CNNs)\nsuccessful. Particularly important is the ability to incorporate domain\nknowledge of invariances, e.g., translational invariance of images. Kernels\nbased on the \\textit{minimum} distance over a group of transformations, which\ncorresponds to defining similarity as the \\textit{best} over the possible\ntransformations, are not generally positive definite. Perhaps it is for this\nreason that they have neither previously been experimentally tested for their\nperformance nor studied theoretically. Instead, previous attempts have employed\nkernels based on the \\textit{average} distance over a group of transformations,\nwhich are trivially positive definite, but which generally yield both poor\nmargins as well as poor performance, as we show. We address this lacuna and\nshow that positive definiteness indeed holds \\textit{with high probability} for\nkernels based on the minimum distance in the small training sample set regime\nof interest, and that they do yield the best results in that regime. Another\nimportant property of CNNs is their ability to incorporate local features at\nmultiple spatial scales, e.g., through max pooling. A third important property\nis their ability to provide the benefits of composition through the\narchitecture of multiple layers.

The\ncurrent VQA models such as VMAF have superior correlation with perceptual\njudgments when videos to be compared have same frame rates and contain\nconventional distortions such as compression, scaling etc. However this\nframework requires additional pre-processing step when videos with different\nframe rates need to be compared, which can potentially limit its overall\nperformance. Recently, Generalized Entropic Difference (GREED) VQA model was\nproposed to account for artifacts that arise due to changes in frame rate, and\nshowed superior performance on the LIVE-YT-HFR database which contains frame\nrate dependent artifacts such as judder, strobing etc. In this paper we propose\na simple extension, where the features from VMAF and GREED are fused in order\nto exploit the advantages of both models. We show through various experiments\nthat the proposed fusion framework results in more efficient features for\npredicting frame rate dependent video quality. We also evaluate the fused\nfeature set on standard non-HFR VQA databases and obtain superior performance\nthan both GREED and VMAF, indicating the combined feature set captures\ncomplimentary perceptual quality information.",

    "abstract": "When people try to influence others to do something, they subconsciously\nadjust their speech to include appropriate emotional information. In order for\na robot to influence people in the same way, the robot should be able to\nimitate the range of human emotions when speaking. To achieve this, we propose\na speech synthesis method for imitating the emotional states in human speech.\nIn contrast to previous methods, the advantage of our method is that it\nrequires less manual effort to adjust the emotion of the synthesized speech.\nOur synthesizer receives an emotion vector to characterize the emotion of\nsynthesized speech. The vector is automatically obtained from human utterances\nby using a speech emotion recognizer. We evaluated our method in a scenario\nwhen a robot tries to regulate an elderly person's circadian rhythm by speaking\nto the person using appropriate emotional states. For the target speech to\nimitate, we collected utterances from professional caregivers when they speak\nto elderly people at different times of the day. Then we conducted a subjective\nevaluation where the elderly participants listened to the speech samples\ngenerated by our method. The results showed that listening to the samples made\nthe participants feel more active in the early morning and calmer in the middle\nof the night. This suggests that the robot may be able to adjust the\nparticipants' circadian rhythm and that the robot can potentially exert\ninfluence similarly to a person.",

To fill this gap,\nwe introduce a new listwise LTR model called Distributionally Robust\nMulti-output Regression Ranking (DRMRR). Different from existing methods, the\nscoring function of DRMRR was designed as a multivariate mapping from a feature\nvector to a vector of deviation scores, which captures local context\ninformation and cross-document interactions. DRMRR uses a Distributionally\nRobust Optimization (DRO) framework to minimize a multi-output loss function\nunder the most adverse distributions in the neighborhood of the empirical data\ndistribution defined by a Wasserstein ball. We show that this is equivalent to\na regularized regression problem with a matrix norm regularizer.

We also conducted a comprehensive analysis to\nassess the resilience of DRMRR against various types of noise: Gaussian noise,\nadversarial perturbations, and label poisoning.

However, the convergence\nefficiency of ND is facing the requirements of multi-vehicle fast networking of\nVANET with frequent topology changes. This paper proposes gossip-based\ninformation dissemination and sensing information assisted ND with MPR\n(GSIM-ND) algorithm for VANET. GSIM-ND algorithm leverages efficient\ngossip-based information dissemination in the case of multi-packet reception\n(MPR). Besides, through multi-target detection function of multiple sensors\ninstalled in roadside unit (RSU), RSU can sense the distribution of vehicles\nand help vehicles to obtain the distribution of their neighbors. Thus, GSIM-ND\nalgorithm leverages the dissemination of sensing information as well. The\nexpected number of discovered neighbors within a given period is theoretically\nderived and used as the critical metric to evaluate the performance of GSIM-ND\nalgorithm. The expected bounds of the number of time slots when a given number\nof neighbors needs to be discovered is derived as well. The simulation results\nverify the correctness of theoretical derivation. It is discovered that GSIM-ND\nalgorithm proposed in this paper can always reach the short-term convergence\nquickly. Moreover, GSIM-ND algorithm is more efficient and stable compared with\ncompletely random algorithm (CRA), scan-based algorithm (SBA) and gossip-based\nalgorithm. The convergence time of GSIM-ND algorithm is 40\\%-90\\% lower than\nthat of these existing algorithms for both low density and high density\nnetworks.

The\narchitecture represents a highly abstracted model of existing Spiking Neural\nNetwork (SNN) architectures. The proposed Optimized Deep Event-driven Spiking\nneural network Architecture (ODESA) can simultaneously learn hierarchical\nspatio-temporal features at multiple arbitrary time scales. ODESA performs\nonline learning without the use of error back-propagation or the calculation of\ngradients. Through the use of simple local adaptive selection thresholds at\neach node, the network rapidly learns to appropriately allocate its neuronal\nresources at each layer for any given problem without using a real-valued error\nmeasure. These adaptive selection thresholds are the central feature of ODESA,\nensuring network stability and remarkable robustness to noise as well as to the\nselection of initial system parameters. Network activations are inherently\nsparse due to a hard Winner-Take-All (WTA) constraint at each layer. We\nevaluate the architecture on existing spatio-temporal datasets, including the\nspike-encoded IRIS and TIDIGITS datasets, as well as a novel set of tasks based\non International Morse Code that we created.

The library provides a\nfeature-rich set of discretization techniques for the numerical approximation\nof a wide range of PDEs, including linear, nonlinear, single-field, and\nmulti-field equations. An expressive API allows users to define PDEs in weak\nform by a syntax close to the mathematical notation. While this is also\navailable in previous codes, the main novelty of Gridap is that it implements\nthis API without introducing a DSL plus a compiler of variational forms.\nInstead, it leverages the Julia just-in-time compiler to build efficient code,\nspecialized for the concrete problem at hand. As a result, there is no need to\nuse different languages for the computational back-end and the user front-end\nanymore, thus eliminating the so-called two-language problem. Gridap also\nprovides a low-level API that is modular and extensible via the\nmultiple-dispatch paradigm of Julia and provides easy access to the main\nbuilding blocks of the library. The main contribution of this paper is the\ndetailed presentation of the novel software abstractions behind the Gridap\ndesign that leverages the new software possibilities provided by the Julia\nlanguage. The second main contribution of the article is a performance\ncomparison against FEniCS. We measure CPU times needed to assemble discrete\nsystems of linear equations for different problem types and show that the\nperformance of Gridap is comparable to FEniCS, demonstrating that the new\nsoftware design does not compromise performance.

    "abstract": "We analyse a coalition formation game between strategic service providers of\na congestible service. The key novelty of our formulation is that it is a\nconstant sum game, i.e., the total payoff across all service providers (or\ncoalitions of providers) is fixed, and dictated by the total size of the\nmarket. The game thus captures the tension between resource pooling (to benefit\nfrom the resulting statistical economies of scale) and competition between\ncoalitions over market share. In a departure from the prior literature on\nresource pooling for congestible services, we show that the grand coalition is\nin general not stable, once we allow for competition over market share.\nInstead, the stable configurations are duopolies, where the dominant coalition\nexploits its economies of scale to corner a disproportionate market share. We\nanalyse the stable duopolies that emerge from this interaction, and also study\na dynamic variant of this game.",

    "abstract": "Recommender system is one of the most important information services on\ntoday's Internet. Recently, graph neural networks have become the new\nstate-of-the-art approach of recommender systems. In this survey, we conduct a\ncomprehensive review of the literature in graph neural network-based\nrecommender systems. We first introduce the background and the history of the\ndevelopment of both recommender systems and graph neural networks. For\nrecommender systems, in general, there are four aspects for categorizing\nexisting works: stage, scenario, objective, and application. For graph neural\nnetworks, the existing methods consist of two categories, spectral models and\nspatial ones. We then discuss the motivation of applying graph neural networks\ninto recommender systems, mainly consisting of the high-order connectivity, the\nstructural property of data, and the enhanced supervision signal. We then\nsystematically analyze the challenges in graph construction, embedding\npropagation/aggregation, model optimization, and computation efficiency.\nAfterward and primarily, we provide a comprehensive overview of a multitude of\nexisting works of graph neural network-based recommender systems, following the\ntaxonomy above. Finally, we raise discussions on the open problems and\npromising future directions of this area.

For\ncomparison, we estimate the uncertainty using two state-of-the-art techniques:\nMonte Carlo dropout and deep ensembles. We also compare different types of CNN\nencoders for feature extraction. We have performed several experiments on an\naffordance database on socially acceptable behaviours and we have shown\nimproved performance compared with previous works.

    "abstract": "The crime forecasting is an important problem as it greatly contributes to\nurban safety. Typically, the goal of the problem is to predict different types\nof crimes for each geographical region (like a neighborhood or censor tract) in\nthe near future. Since nearby regions usually have similar socioeconomic\ncharacteristics which indicate similar crime patterns, recent state-of-the-art\nsolutions constructed a distance-based region graph and utilized Graph Neural\nNetwork (GNN) techniques for crime forecasting, because the GNN techniques\ncould effectively exploit the latent relationships between neighboring region\nnodes in the graph. However, this distance-based pre-defined graph cannot fully\ncapture crime correlation between regions that are far from each other but\nshare similar crime patterns. Hence, to make an accurate crime prediction, the\nmain challenge is to learn a better graph that reveals the dependencies between\nregions in crime occurrences and meanwhile captures the temporal patterns from\nhistorical crime records. To address these challenges, we propose an end-to-end\ngraph convolutional recurrent network called HAGEN with several novel designs\nfor crime prediction. Specifically, our framework could jointly capture the\ncrime correlation between regions and the temporal crime dynamics by combining\nan adaptive region graph learning module with the Diffusion Convolution Gated\nRecurrent Unit (DCGRU). Based on the homophily assumption of GNN, we propose a\nhomophily-aware constraint to regularize the optimization of the region graph\nso that neighboring region nodes on the learned graph share similar crime\npatterns, thus fitting the mechanism of diffusion convolution. It also\nincorporates crime embedding to model the interdependencies between regions and\ncrime categories. Empirical experiments and comprehensive analysis on two\nreal-world datasets showcase the effectiveness of HAGEN.",

    "abstract": "Recently, many arbitrary-oriented object detection (AOOD) methods have been\nproposed and attracted widespread attention in many fields. However, most of\nthem are based on anchor-boxes or standard Gaussian heatmaps. Such label\nassignment strategy may not only fail to reflect the shape and direction\ncharacteristics of arbitrary-oriented objects, but also have high\nparameter-tuning efforts. In this paper, a novel AOOD method called General\nGaussian Heatmap Labeling (GGHL) is proposed. Specifically, an anchor-free\nobject-adaptation label assignment (OLA) strategy is presented to define the\npositive candidates based on two-dimensional (2-D) oriented Gaussian heatmaps,\nwhich reflect the shape and direction features of arbitrary-oriented objects.\nBased on OLA, an oriented-bounding-box (OBB) representation component (ORC) is\ndeveloped to indicate OBBs and adjust the Gaussian center prior weights to fit\nthe characteristics of different objects adaptively through neural network\nlearning. Moreover, a joint-optimization loss (JOL) with area normalization and\ndynamic confidence weighting is designed to refine the misalign optimal results\nof different subtasks. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate\nthat the proposed GGHL improves the AOOD performance with low parameter-tuning\nand time costs. Furthermore, it is generally applicable to most AOOD methods to\nimprove their performance including lightweight models on embedded platforms.",

    "abstract": "Object type classification for automotive radar has greatly improved with\nrecent deep learning (DL) solutions, however these developments have mostly\nfocused on the classification accuracy. Before employing DL solutions in\nsafety-critical applications, such as automated driving, an indispensable\nprerequisite is the accurate quantification of the classifiers' reliability.\nUnfortunately, DL classifiers are characterized as black-box systems which\noutput severely over-confident predictions, leading downstream decision-making\nsystems to false conclusions with possibly catastrophic consequences. We find\nthat deep radar classifiers maintain high-confidences for ambiguous, difficult\nsamples, e.g. small objects measured at large distances, under domain shift and\nsignal corruptions, regardless of the correctness of the predictions. The focus\nof this article is to learn deep radar spectra classifiers which offer robust\nreal-time uncertainty estimates using label smoothing during training. Label\nsmoothing is a technique of refining, or softening, the hard labels typically\navailable in classification datasets. In this article, we exploit\nradar-specific know-how to define soft labels which encourage the classifiers\nto learn to output high-quality calibrated uncertainty estimates, thereby\npartially resolving the problem of over-confidence. Our investigations show how\nsimple radar knowledge can easily be combined with complex data-driven learning\nalgorithms to yield safe automotive radar perception.",

Contemporary\nbrain-scale networks correspond to directed graphs of a few million nodes, each\nwith an in-degree and out-degree of several thousands of edges, where nodes and\nedges correspond to the fundamental biological units, neurons and synapses,\nrespectively. When considering a random graph, each node's edges are\ndistributed across thousands of parallel processes. The activity in neuronal\nnetworks is also sparse. Each neuron occasionally transmits a brief signal,\ncalled spike, via its outgoing synapses to the corresponding target neurons.\nThis spatial and temporal sparsity represents an inherent bottleneck for\nsimulations on conventional computers: Fundamentally irregular memory-access\npatterns cause poor cache utilization. Using an established neuronal network\nsimulation code as a reference implementation, we investigate how common\ntechniques to recover cache performance such as software-induced prefetching\nand software pipelining can benefit a real-world application. The algorithmic\nchanges reduce simulation time by up to 50%.

Towards this end, we propose\ntwo dedicated forms of meta neighborhood aggregators, an exclusive meta\naggregator termed as Greedy Gumbel Neighborhood Aggregator (GNA), and a\ndiffused meta aggregator termed as Adaptable Hybrid Neighborhood Aggregator\n(ANA). GNA learns to exclusively pick one single optimal aggregator from a pool\nof candidates, while ANA learns a hybrid aggregation behavior to simultaneously\nretain the benefits of several individual aggregators.

    "abstract": "In future wireless networks, one of the use-cases of interest is\nInternet-of-vehicles (IoV). Here, IoV refers to two different functionalities,\nnamely, serving the in-vehicle users and supporting the connected-vehicle\nfunctionalities, where both can be well provided by the transceivers installed\non top of vehicles. Such dual functionality of on-vehicle transceivers,\nhowever, implies strict rate and reliability requirements, for which one may\nneed to utilize large bandwidths/beamforming, acquire up-to-date channel state\ninformation (CSI) and avoid blockages. In this article, we incorporate the\nrecently proposed concept of predictor antennas (PAs) into a\n\\textit{large-scale cooperative PA (LSCPA)} setup where both temporal blockages\nand CSI out-dating are avoided via base stations (BSs)/vehicles cooperation.\nSummarizing the ongoing standardization progress enabling IoV communications,\nwe present the potentials and challenges of the LSCPA setup, and compare the\neffect of cooperative and non-cooperative schemes on the performance of IoV\nlinks. As we show, the BSs cooperation and blockage/CSI prediction can boost\nthe performance of IoV links remarkably.",

Additionally, it provides capabilities to prioritize the traffic of\nspecific flows, potentially considering their delay demands.

In this paper, we present HTBQueue, our implementation of a compound\nmodule for HTB support in the discrete event simulator OMNeT++.

    "abstract": "The mechanical simplicity, hover capabilities, and high agility of quadrotors\nlead to a fast adaption in the industry for inspection, exploration, and urban\naerial mobility. On the other hand, the unstable and underactuated dynamics of\nquadrotors render them highly susceptible to system faults, especially rotor\nfailures. In this work, we propose a fault-tolerant controller using the\nnonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to stabilize and control a quadrotor\nsubjected to the complete failure of a single rotor. Differently from existing\nworks that either rely on linear assumptions or resort to cascaded structures\nneglecting input constraints in the outer-loop, our method leverages full\nnonlinear dynamics of the damaged quadrotor and considers the thrust constraint\nof each rotor. Hence, this method can seamlessly transition from nominal to\nrotor failure flights, and effectively perform upset recovery from extreme\ninitial conditions. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments are\nconducted for validation, which demonstrates that the proposed NMPC method can\neffectively recover the damaged quadrotor even if the failure occurs during\naggressive maneuvers, such as flipping and tracking agile trajectories.",

    "abstract": "Item recommendation based on historical user-item interactions is of vital\nimportance for web-based services. However, the data used to train a\nrecommender system (RS) suffers from severe popularity bias. Interactions of a\nsmall fraction of popular (head) items account for almost the whole training\ndata. Normal training methods from such biased data tend to repetitively\ngenerate recommendations from the head items, which further exacerbates the\ndata bias and affects the exploration of potentially interesting items from\nniche (tail) items. In this paper, we explore the central theme of long-tail\nrecommendation. Through an empirical study, we find that head items are very\nlikely to be recommended due to the fact that the gradients coming from head\nitems dominate the overall gradient update process, which further affects the\noptimization of tail items. To this end, we propose a general framework namely\nItem Cluster-Wise Multi-Objective Training (ICMT) for long-tail recommendation.\nFirstly, the disentangled representation learning is utilized to identify the\npopularity impact behind user-item interactions. Then item clusters are\nadaptively formulated according to the disentangled popularity representation.\nAfter that, we consider the learning over the whole training data as a weighted\naggregation of multiple item cluster-wise objectives, which can be resolved\nthrough a Pareto-Efficient solver for a harmonious overall gradient direction.\nBesides, a contractive loss focusing on model robustness is derived as a\nregularization term. We instantiate ICMT with three state-of-the-art\nrecommendation models and conduct experiments on three real-world datasets.\n%Through alleviating the popularity bias, Experimental results demonstrate that\nthe proposed ICMT significantly improves the overall recommendation\nperformance, especially on tail items.",

    "abstract": "The use of semantic technologies is gaining significant traction in science\ncommunication with a wide array of applications in disciplines including the\nLife Sciences, Computer Science, and the Social Sciences. Languages like RDF,\nOWL, and other formalisms based on formal logic are applied to make scientific\nknowledge accessible not only to human readers but also to automated systems.\nThese approaches have mostly focused on the structure of scientific\npublications themselves, on the used scientific methods and equipment, or on\nthe structure of the used datasets. The core claims or hypotheses of scientific\nwork have only been covered in a shallow manner, such as by linking mentioned\nentities to established identifiers. In this research, we therefore want to\nfind out whether we can use existing semantic formalisms to fully express the\ncontent of high-level scientific claims using formal semantics in a systematic\nway. Analyzing the main claims from a sample of scientific articles from all\ndisciplines, we find that their semantics are more complex than what a\nstraight-forward application of formalisms like RDF or OWL account for, but we\nmanaged to elicit a clear semantic pattern which we call the 'super-pattern'.\nWe show here how the instantiation of the five slots of this super-pattern\nleads to a strictly defined statement in higher-order logic. We successfully\napplied this super-pattern to an enlarged sample of scientific claims. We show\nthat knowledge representation experts, when instructed to independently\ninstantiate the super-pattern with given scientific claims, show a high degree\nof consistency and convergence given the complexity of the task and the\nsubject. These results therefore open the door for expressing high-level\nscientific findings in a manner they can be automatically interpreted, which on\nthe longer run can allow us to do automated consistency checking, and much\nmore.",

Recently, two families of self-supervised methods,\ncontrastive learning and latent bootstrapping, exemplified by SimCLR and BYOL\nrespectively, have made significant progress. In this work, we hypothesize that\nadding explicit information compression to these algorithms yields better and\nmore robust representations. We verify this by developing SimCLR and BYOL\nformulations compatible with the Conditional Entropy Bottleneck (CEB)\nobjective, allowing us to both measure and control the amount of compression in\nthe learned representation, and observe their impact on downstream tasks.\nFurthermore, we explore the relationship between Lipschitz continuity and\ncompression, showing a tractable lower bound on the Lipschitz constant of the\nencoders we learn. As Lipschitz continuity is closely related to robustness,\nthis provides a new explanation for why compressed models are more robust. Our\nexperiments confirm that adding compression to SimCLR and BYOL significantly\nimproves linear evaluation accuracies and model robustness across a wide range\nof domain shifts. In particular, the compressed version of BYOL achieves 76.0%\nTop-1 linear evaluation accuracy on ImageNet with ResNet-50, and 78.8% with\nResNet-50 2x.",

    "abstract": "In machine learning workflows, determining invariance qualities of a model is\na common testing procedure. In this paper, we propose an automatic testing\nframework that is applicable to a variety of invariance qualities. We draw an\nanalogy between invariance testing and medical image analysis and propose to\nuse variance matrices as ``imagery'' testing data. This enables us to employ\nmachine learning techniques for analysing such ``imagery'' testing data\nautomatically, hence facilitating ML4ML (machine learning for machine\nlearning). We demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed\nframework by developing ML4ML models (assessors) for determining rotation-,\nbrightness-, and size-variances of a collection of neural networks. Our testing\nresults show that the trained ML4ML assessors can perform such analytical tasks\nwith sufficient accuracy.",

    "title": "Sparse Spatial Transformers for Few-Shot Learning",
    "abstract": "Learning from limited data is a challenging task since the scarcity of data\nleads to a poor generalization of the trained model. The classical global\npooled representation is likely to lose useful local information. Recently,\nmany few shot learning methods address this challenge by using deep descriptors\nand learning a pixel-level metric. However, using deep descriptors as feature\nrepresentations may lose the contextual information of the image. And most of\nthese methods deal with each class in the support set independently, which\ncannot sufficiently utilize discriminative information and task-specific\nembeddings. In this paper, we propose a novel Transformer based neural network\narchitecture called Sparse Spatial Transformers (SSFormers), which can find\ntask-relevant features and suppress task-irrelevant features. Specifically, we\nfirst divide each input image into several image patches of different sizes to\nobtain dense local features. These features retain contextual information while\nexpressing local information. Then, a sparse spatial transformer layer is\nproposed to find spatial correspondence between the query image and the entire\nsupport set to select task-relevant image patches and suppress task-irrelevant\nimage patches. Finally, we propose an image patch matching module to calculate\nthe distance between dense local representations to determine which category\nthe query image belongs to in the support set. Extensive experiments on popular\nfew-shot learning benchmarks show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art\nperformance.

However, their memory\nfootprint and high latency are prohibitive for efficient deployment and\ninference on resource-limited devices. In this work, we explore quantization\nfor transformers. We show that transformers have unique quantization challenges\n-- namely, high dynamic activation ranges that are difficult to represent with\na low bit fixed-point format. We establish that these activations contain\nstructured outliers in the residual connections that encourage specific\nattention patterns, such as attending to the special separator token. To combat\nthese challenges, we present three solutions based on post-training\nquantization and quantization-aware training, each with a different set of\ncompromises for accuracy, model size, and ease of use. In particular, we\nintroduce a novel quantization scheme -- per-embedding-group quantization. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on the GLUE benchmark using BERT,\nestablishing state-of-the-art results for post-training quantization.

However, cascaded models are\nknown to be prone to error propagation and model discrepancy problems.\nFurthermore, there is no possibility of using end-to-end training data in\nconventional cascaded systems, meaning that the training data most suited for\nthe task cannot be used. Previous studies suggested several approaches for\nintegrated end-to-end training to overcome those problems, however they mostly\nrely on (synthetic or natural) three-way data. We propose a cascaded model\nbased on the non-autoregressive Transformer that enables end-to-end training\nwithout the need for an explicit intermediate representation. This new\narchitecture (i) avoids unnecessary early decisions that can cause errors which\nare then propagated throughout the cascaded models and (ii) utilizes the\nend-to-end training data directly.

    "abstract": "The OMNeT++ simulator is well-suited for the simulation of randomized user\nbehavior in communication networks. However, there are scenarios, where such a\nrandom model is unsuited to evaluate a communication system, and this paper\nattempts to highlight such a case. Using this example of ad-hoc communication\nbetween aircraft mid-flight, a tutorial-style description is attempted that\nshall show how the OMNeT++ simulator can be used when a wealth of real-world\ntrace data is available. In particular, it is described how mobility trace\nfiles can be directly used within OMNeT++, and how to link the generation of\ndata messages to this mobility data. This is explained via an example\nsimulation that evaluates a communication network in which an aircraft notifies\nthe ground control when it enters or leaves a specific geographic region.\nAdditionally, a novel trace-based application has been developed to achieve\nthis link between mobility and message generation. Furthermore, a new\nTDMA-based medium access protocol for decentralized communication networks is\npresented, which is oracle-based and thus allows a TDMA-like behavior of medium\naccess without causing any overhead; it can be useful when upper-layer\nprotocols should be evaluated under the assumption of TDMA-like behavior, but\nisolated from the effects of a full-fledged TDMA protocol. Finally, physical\nlayer behavior is often either overly simplistic or overly computationally\nexpensive. For the latter case, when a detailed channel model is available but\nits evaluation requires prohibitive computational effort, then averaging its\nbehavior into trace data can find a middle ground between efficient evaluation\nand realistic representation. Hence, a novel trace-based radio model has been\ndeveloped that makes use of an SNR to PER mapping. In the spirit of open\nscience, all implementations have been made available under open licenses.",

To this end,\nthis paper develop a new Sinkhorn neural network which learns a non-convex\nprojection task onto a set of permutation matrices. An unsupervised training\nalgorithm is proposed where the Sinkhorn neural network can be applied to\nnetwork assignment problems. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed method in various network scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Bilateral trade, a fundamental topic in economics, models the problem of\nintermediating between two strategic agents, a seller and a buyer, willing to\ntrade a good for which they hold private valuations. In this paper, we cast the\nbilateral trade problem in a regret minimization framework over $T$ rounds of\nseller/buyer interactions, with no prior knowledge on their private valuations.\nOur main contribution is a complete characterization of the regret regimes for\nfixed-price mechanisms with different feedback models and private valuations,\nusing as a benchmark the best fixed-price in hindsight. More precisely, we\nprove the following tight bounds on the regret:\n- $\\Theta(\\sqrt{T})$ for full-feedback (i.e., direct revelation mechanisms).\n- $\\Theta(T^{2/3})$ for realistic feedback (i.e., posted-price mechanisms)\nand independent seller/buyer valuations with bounded densities.\n- $\\Theta(T)$ for realistic feedback and seller/buyer valuations with bounded\ndensities.\n- $\\Theta(T)$ for realistic feedback and independent seller/buyer valuations.\n- $\\Theta(T)$ for the adversarial setting.",

    "abstract": "Multi-beam LiDAR sensors are increasingly used in robotics, particularly for\nautonomous cars for localization and perception tasks. However, perception is\nclosely linked to the localization task and the robot's ability to build a fine\nmap of its environment. For this, we propose a new real-time LiDAR odometry\nmethod called CT-ICP, as well as a complete SLAM with loop closure. The\nprinciple of CT-ICP is to use an elastic formulation of the trajectory, with a\ncontinuity of poses intra-scan and discontinuity between scans, to be more\nrobust to high frequencies in the movements of the sensor. The registration is\nbased on scan-to-map with a dense point cloud as map structured in sparse\nvoxels to operate in real time. At the same time, a fast method of loop closure\ndetection using elevation images and an optimization of poses by graph allows\nto obtain a complete SLAM purely on LiDAR. To show the robustness of the\nmethod, we tested it on seven datasets: KITTI, KITTI-raw, KITTI-360,\nKITTI-CARLA, ParisLuco, Newer College, and NCLT in driving and high-frequency\nmotion scenarios. The CT-ICP odometry is implemented in C++ and available\nonline. The loop detection and pose graph optimization is in the framework\npyLiDAR-SLAM in Python and also available online. CT-ICP is currently first,\namong those giving access to a public code, on the KITTI odometry leaderboard,\nwith an average Relative Translation Error (RTE) of 0.59% and an average time\nper scan of 60ms on a CPU with a single thread.",

Container images are stored in\nregistry services and operated by orchestration platforms to download and start\nthe respective applications on nodes of the infrastructure. During large\napplication rollouts, the connection to the registry is prone to become a\nbottleneck, which results in longer provisioning times and deployment\nlatencies. Previous work has mainly addressed this problem by proposing\nscalable registries, leveraging the BitTorrent protocol or distributed storage\nto host container images. However, for lightweight and dynamic edge\nenvironments the overhead of several dedicated components is not feasible in\nregard to its interference of the actual workload and is subject to failures\ndue to the introduced complexity.\nIn this paper we introduce a fully decentralized container registry called\nEdgePier, that can be deployed across edge sites and is able to decrease\ncontainer deployment times by utilizing peer-to-peer connections between\nparticipating nodes. Image layers are shared without the need for further\ncentralized orchestration entities. The conducted evaluation shows that the\nprovisioning times are improved by up to 65% in comparison to a baseline\nregistry, even with limited bandwidth to the cloud.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we present our 2nd place solution to ACM RecSys 2021 Challenge\norganized by Twitter. The challenge aims to predict user engagement for a set\nof tweets, offering an exceptionally large data set of 1 billion data points\nsampled from over four weeks of real Twitter interactions. Each data point\ncontains multiple sources of information, such as tweet text along with\nengagement features, user features, and tweet features. The challenge brings\nthe problem close to a real production environment by introducing strict\nlatency constraints in the model evaluation phase: the average inference time\nfor single tweet engagement prediction is limited to 6ms on a single CPU core\nwith 64GB memory. Our proposed model relies on extensive feature engineering\nperformed with methods such as the Efficient Manifold Density Estimator (EMDE)\n- our previously introduced algorithm based on Locality Sensitive Hashing\nmethod, and novel Fourier Feature Encoding, among others. In total, we create\nnumerous features describing a user's Twitter account status and the content of\na tweet. In order to adhere to the strict latency constraints, the underlying\nmodel is a simple residual feed-forward neural network. The system is a\nvariation of our previous methods which proved successful in KDD Cup 2021, WSDM\nChallenge 2021, and SIGIR eCom Challenge 2020.

    "abstract": "In complex environments with high dimension, training a reinforcement\nlearning (RL) model from scratch often suffers from lengthy and tedious\ncollection of agent-environment interactions. Instead, leveraging expert\ndemonstration to guide RL agent can boost sample efficiency and improve final\nconvergence. In order to better integrate expert prior with on-policy RL\nmodels, we propose a generic framework for Learning from Demonstration (LfD)\nbased on actor-critic algorithms. Technically, we first employ K-Means\nclustering to evaluate the similarity of sampled exploration with demonstration\ndata. Then we increase the likelihood of actions in similar frames by modifying\nthe gradient update strategy to leverage demonstration. We conduct experiments\non 4 standard benchmark environments in Mujoco and 2 self-designed robotic\nenvironments. Results show that, under certain condition, our algorithm can\nimprove sample efficiency by 20% ~ 40%. By combining our framework with\non-policy algorithms, RL models can accelerate convergence and obtain better\nfinal mean episode rewards especially in complex robotic context where\ninteractions are expensive.",

    "abstract": "While pre-trained language models (PLMs) are the go-to solution to tackle\nmany natural language processing problems, they are still very limited in their\nability to capture and to use common-sense knowledge. In fact, even if\ninformation is available in the form of approximate (soft) logical rules, it is\nnot clear how to transfer it to a PLM in order to improve its performance for\ndeductive reasoning tasks. Here, we aim to bridge this gap by teaching PLMs how\nto reason with soft Horn rules.

We release the first dataset for this task, and we propose\na revised loss function that enables the PLM to learn how to predict precise\nprobabilities for the task. Our evaluation results show that the resulting\nfine-tuned models achieve very high performance, even on logical rules that\nwere unseen at training. Moreover, we demonstrate that logical notions\nexpressed by the rules are transferred to the fine-tuned model, yielding\nstate-of-the-art results on external datasets.",

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection is increasingly important to handle the amount of sensor\ndata in Edge and Fog environments, Smart Cities, as well as in Industry 4.0. To\nensure good results, the utilized ML models need to be updated periodically to\nadapt to seasonal changes and concept drifts in the sensor data. Although the\nincreasing resource availability at the edge can allow for in-situ execution of\nmodel training directly on the devices, it is still often offloaded to fog\ndevices or the cloud.\nIn this paper, we propose Local-Optimistic Scheduling (LOS), a method for\nexecuting periodic ML model training jobs in close proximity to the data\nsources, without overloading lightweight edge devices. Training jobs are\noffloaded to nearby neighbor nodes as necessary and the resource consumption is\noptimized to meet the training period while still ensuring enough resources for\nfurther training executions. This scheduling is accomplished in a\ndecentralized, collaborative and opportunistic manner, without full knowledge\nof the infrastructure and workload. We evaluated our method in an edge\ncomputing testbed on real-world datasets. The experimental results show that\nLOS places the training executions close to the input sensor streams, decreases\nthe deviation between training time and training period by up to 40% and\nincreases the amount of successfully scheduled training jobs compared to an\nin-situ execution.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) aims to protect data privacy by cooperatively\nlearning a model without sharing private data among users. For Federated\nLearning of Deep Neural Network with billions of model parameters, existing\nprivacy-preserving solutions are unsatisfactory. Homomorphic encryption (HE)\nbased methods provide secure privacy protections but suffer from extremely high\ncomputational and communication overheads rendering it almost useless in\npractice . Deep learning with Differential Privacy (DP) was implemented as a\npractical learning algorithm at a manageable cost in complexity. However, DP is\nvulnerable to aggressive Bayesian restoration attacks as disclosed in the\nliterature and demonstrated in experimental results of this work. To address\nthe aforementioned perplexity, we propose a novel Bayesian Privacy (BP)\nframework which enables Bayesian restoration attacks to be formulated as the\nprobability of reconstructing private data from observed public information.\nSpecifically, the proposed BP framework accurately quantifies privacy loss by\nKullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence between the prior distribution about the\nprivacy data and the posterior distribution of restoration private data\nconditioning on exposed information}. To our best knowledge, this Bayesian\nPrivacy analysis is the first to provides theoretical justification of secure\nprivacy-preserving capabilities against Bayesian restoration attacks. As a\nconcrete use case, we demonstrate that a novel federated deep learning method\nusing private passport layers is able to simultaneously achieve high model\nperformance, privacy-preserving capability and low computational complexity.\nTheoretical analysis is in accordance with empirical measurements of\ninformation leakage extensively experimented with a variety of DNN networks on\nimage classification MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets.",

In this paper we investigate the extent to which the contextualised\nembeddings of word forms that display multiplicity of sense reflect traditional\ndistinctions of polysemy and homonymy. To this end, we introduce an extended,\nhuman-annotated dataset of graded word sense similarity and co-predication\nacceptability, and evaluate how well the similarity of embeddings predicts\nsimilarity in meaning. Both types of human judgements indicate that the\nsimilarity of polysemic interpretations falls in a continuum between identity\nof meaning and homonymy. However, we also observe significant differences\nwithin the similarity ratings of polysemes, forming consistent patterns for\ndifferent types of polysemic sense alternation. Our dataset thus appears to\ncapture a substantial part of the complexity of lexical ambiguity, and can\nprovide a realistic test bed for contextualised embeddings. Among the tested\nmodels, BERT Large shows the strongest correlation with the collected word\nsense similarity ratings, but struggles to consistently replicate the observed\nsimilarity patterns.

    "abstract": "Due to the pervasive diffusion of personal mobile and IoT devices, many\n``smart environments'' (e.g., smart cities and smart factories) will be, among\nothers, generators of huge amounts of data. Currently, this is typically\nachieved through centralised cloud-based data analytics services. However,\naccording to many studies, this approach may present significant issues from\nthe standpoint of data ownership, and even wireless network capacity. One\npossibility to cope with these shortcomings is to move data analytics closer to\nwhere data is generated. In this paper, we tackle this issue by proposing and\nanalyzing a distributed learning framework, whereby data analytics are\nperformed at the edge of the network, i.e., on locations very close to where\ndata is generated. Specifically, in our framework, partial data analytics are\nperformed directly on the nodes that generate the data, or on nodes close by\n(e.g., some of the data generators can take this role on behalf of subsets of\nother nodes nearby). Then, nodes exchange partial models and refine them\naccordingly. Our framework is general enough to host different analytics\nservices. In the specific case analysed in the paper, we focus on a learning\ntask, considering two distributed learning algorithms. Using an activity\nrecognition and a pattern recognition task, both on reference datasets, we\ncompare the two learning algorithms between each other and with a central cloud\nsolution (i.e., one that has access to the complete datasets). Our results show\nthat using distributed machine learning techniques, it is possible to\ndrastically reduce the network overhead, while obtaining performance comparable\nto the cloud solution in terms of learning accuracy. The analysis also shows\nwhen each distributed learning approach is preferable, based on the specific\ndistribution of the data on the nodes.",

    "title": "Learning of Parameters in Behavior Trees for Movement Skills",
    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful mathematical framework that allows\nrobots to learn complex skills by trial-and-error. Despite numerous successes\nin many applications, RL algorithms still require thousands of trials to\nconverge to high-performing policies, can produce dangerous behaviors while\nlearning, and the optimized policies (usually modeled as neural networks) give\nalmost zero explanation when they fail to perform the task. For these reasons,\nthe adoption of RL in industrial settings is not common. Behavior Trees (BTs),\non the other hand, can provide a policy representation that a) supports modular\nand composable skills, b) allows for easy interpretation of the robot actions,\nand c) provides an advantageous low-dimensional parameter space. In this paper,\nwe present a novel algorithm that can learn the parameters of a BT policy in\nsimulation and then generalize to the physical robot without any additional\ntraining. We leverage a physical simulator with a digital twin of our\nworkstation, and optimize the relevant parameters with a black-box optimizer.\nWe showcase the efficacy of our method with a 7-DOF KUKA-iiwa manipulator in a\ntask that includes obstacle avoidance and a contact-rich insertion\n(peg-in-hole), in which our method outperforms the baselines.",

    "title": "Channel Customization for Joint Tx-RISs-Rx Design in Hybrid mmWave  systems",
    "abstract": "In strong line-of-sight millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless systems, the\nrank-deficient channel severely hampers spatial multiplexing. To address this\ninherent deficiency, distributed reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are\nintroduced in this study to customize the wireless channel. Capitalizing on the\nability of the RIS to reshape electromagnetic waves, we theoretically show that\na favorable channel with an arbitrary tunable rank and a minimized truncated\ncondition number can be established by elaborately designing the placement and\nreflection matrix of RISs. Different from existing works on distributed RISs,\nthe number of elements needed for each RIS to combat the path loss and the\nlimited phase control is also considered in this research. On the basis of the\nproposed channel customization, a joint transmitter-RISs-receiver (Tx-RISs-Rx)\ndesign under a hybrid mmWave system is investigated to maximize the downlink\nspectral efficiency. Using the proposed scheme, the optimal singular value\ndecomposition-based hybrid beamforming at the Tx and Rx can be easily obtained\nwithout matrix decomposition for the digital and analog beamforming. The\nbottoms of the sub-channel mode in the water-filling power allocation\nalgorithm, which are conventionally uncontrollable when the noise power is\nfixed, are proven to be independently adjustable by RISs. Moreover, the\ntransmit power required for realizing multi-stream transmission is derived.\nNumerical results are presented to verify our theoretical analysis and exhibit\nsubstantial gains over systems without RISs.",

    "abstract": "In NLP, a large volume of tasks involve pairwise comparison between two\nsequences (e.g. sentence similarity and paraphrase identification).\nPredominantly, two formulations are used for sentence-pair tasks: bi-encoders\nand cross-encoders. Bi-encoders produce fixed-dimensional sentence\nrepresentations and are computationally efficient, however, they usually\nunderperform cross-encoders. Cross-encoders can leverage their attention heads\nto exploit inter-sentence interactions for better performance but they require\ntask fine-tuning and are computationally more expensive. In this paper, we\npresent a completely unsupervised sentence representation model termed as\nTrans-Encoder that combines the two learning paradigms into an iterative joint\nframework to simultaneously learn enhanced bi- and cross-encoders.\nSpecifically, on top of a pre-trained Language Model (PLM), we start with\nconverting it to an unsupervised bi-encoder, and then alternate between the bi-\nand cross-encoder task formulations. In each alternation, one task formulation\nwill produce pseudo-labels which are used as learning signals for the other\ntask formulation. We then propose an extension to conduct such\nself-distillation approach on multiple PLMs in parallel and use the average of\ntheir pseudo-labels for mutual-distillation. Trans-Encoder creates, to the best\nof our knowledge, the first completely unsupervised cross-encoder and also a\nstate-of-the-art unsupervised bi-encoder for sentence similarity. Both the\nbi-encoder and cross-encoder formulations of Trans-Encoder outperform recently\nproposed state-of-the-art unsupervised sentence encoders such as Mirror-BERT\nand SimCSE by up to 5% on the sentence similarity benchmarks.",

To\nidentify the credibility of the posted claim, probable instances/clues(titles)\nof news information are first gathered from various web platforms.

The four\nsets of features based on the content, linguistics/semantic cues, similarity,\nand sentiments gathered from web-platforms and voting are applied to validate\nthe news. Finally, the combined voting decides the support given to a specific\nclaim.

To address these issues, we proposed\nCluster Attack, a novel adversarial attack by introducing a set of fake nodes\nto the original graph which can mislead the classification on certain victim\nnodes. Specifically, we query the victim model for each victim node to acquire\ntheir most adversarial feature, which is related to how the fake node's feature\nwill affect the victim nodes. We further cluster the victim nodes into several\nsubgroups according to their most adversarial features such that we can reduce\nthe searching space. Moreover, our attack is performed in a practical and\nunnoticeable manner: (1) We protect the predicted labels of nodes which we are\nnot aimed for from being changed during attack. (2) We attack by introducing\nfake nodes into the original graph without changing existing links and\nfeatures. (3) We attack with only partial information about the attacked graph,\ni.e., by leveraging the information of victim nodes along with their neighbors\nwithin $k$-hop instead of the whole graph.

Significant progress has been made\non this problem, however, solutions remain elusive when the source signal is\nunknown (such as human voice) and the channel is strongly correlated (such as\nin multipath settings). Today's algorithms reliably estimate the\ndirect-path-AoA, but the subsequent AoAs diverge in noisy real-world\nconditions.\nWe design SubAoA, an algorithm that improves on the current body of work. Our\ncore idea models signal in a new AoA sub-space, and employs a cancellation\napproach that successively cancels each AoA to decode the next.

However, only using the code snippets in question\nbody cannot provide sufficient information for title generation, and LSTMs\ncannot capture the long-range dependencies between tokens. Objective: We\npropose CCBERT, a deep learning based novel model to enhance the performance of\nquestion title generation by making full use of the bi-modal information of the\nentire question body. Methods: CCBERT follows the encoder-decoder paradigm, and\nuses CodeBERT to encode the question body into hidden representations, a\nstacked Transformer decoder to generate predicted tokens, and an additional\ncopy attention layer to refine the output distribution. Both the encoder and\ndecoder perform the multi-head self-attention operation to better capture the\nlong-range dependencies.

In this paper, we\nargue that besides evaluating the interactive capabilities of IACs, their\nunderlying driver models should be validated on natural human driving behavior.\nWe propose a workflow for this validation that includes scenario-based data\nextraction and a two-stage (tactical/operational) evaluation procedure based on\nhuman factors literature. We demonstrate this workflow in a case study on an\ninverse-reinforcement-learning-based driver model replicated from an existing\nIAC.

In particular, we assume that the\ntarget object is located in a cluttered environment where both prehensile\ngrasping and non-prehensile manipulation are combined for efficient\nteleoperation. A trajectory-based reinforcement learning is utilized for\nlearning the non-prehensile manipulation to rearrange the objects for enabling\ndirect grasping. From the depth image of the cluttered environment and the\nlocation of the goal object, the learned policy can provide multiple options of\nnon-prehensile manipulation to the human operator. We carefully design a reward\nfunction for the rearranging task where the policy is trained in a simulational\nenvironment.

ErrPs, originally described by cognitive psychologists, have been\nadopted for use in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for the detection and\ncorrection of errors, and the online refinement of decoding algorithms.\nRiemannian geometry-based feature extraction and classification is a new\napproach to BCI which shows good performance in a range of experimental\nparadigms, but has yet to be applied to the classification of ErrPs. Here, we\ndescribe an experiment that elicited ErrPs in seven normal participants\nperforming a visual discrimination task. Audio feedback was provided on each\ntrial. We used multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings to classify\nErrPs (success/failure), comparing a Riemannian geometry-based method to a\ntraditional approach that computes time-point features. Overall, the Riemannian\napproach outperformed the traditional approach (78.2% versus 75.9% accuracy, p\n< 0.05); this difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05) in three of\nseven participants.

    "abstract": "Vision transformer (ViT) has been widely applied in many areas due to its\nself-attention mechanism that help obtain the global receptive field since the\nfirst layer. It even achieves surprising performance exceeding CNN in some\nvision tasks. However, there exists an issue when leveraging vision transformer\ninto 2D+3D facial expression recognition (FER), i.e., ViT training needs mass\ndata. Nonetheless, the number of samples in public 2D+3D FER datasets is far\nfrom sufficient for evaluation. How to utilize the ViT pre-trained on RGB\nimages to handle 2D+3D data becomes a challenge. To solve this problem, we\npropose a robust lightweight pure transformer-based network for multimodal\n2D+3D FER, namely MFEViT. For narrowing the gap between RGB and multimodal\ndata, we devise an alternative fusion strategy, which replaces each of the\nthree channels of an RGB image with the depth-map channel and fuses them before\nfeeding them into the transformer encoder. Moreover, the designed sample\nfiltering module adds several subclasses for each expression and move the noisy\nsamples to their corresponding subclasses, thus eliminating their disturbance\non the network during the training stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our MFEViT outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with an accuracy of\n90.83% on BU-3DFE and 90.28% on Bosphorus. Specifically, the proposed MFEViT is\na lightweight model, requiring much fewer parameters than multi-branch CNNs. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce vision\ntransformer into multimodal 2D+3D FER. The source code of our MFEViT will be\npublicly available online.",

    "abstract": "Tremendous progress has been made in sequential processing with the recent\nadvances in recurrent neural networks. However, recurrent architectures face\nthe challenge of exploding/vanishing gradients during training, and require\nsignificant computational resources to execute back-propagation through time.\nMoreover, large models are typically needed for executing complex sequential\ntasks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel neuron model that has\ncosine activation with a time varying component for sequential processing. The\nproposed neuron provides an efficient building block for projecting sequential\ninputs into spectral domain, which helps to retain long-term dependencies with\nminimal extra model parameters and computation. A new type of recurrent network\narchitecture, named Oscillatory Fourier Neural Network, based on the proposed\nneuron is presented and applied to various types of sequential tasks. We\ndemonstrate that recurrent neural network with the proposed neuron model is\nmathematically equivalent to a simplified form of discrete Fourier transform\napplied onto periodical activation. In particular, the computationally\nintensive back-propagation through time in training is eliminated, leading to\nfaster training while achieving the state of the art inference accuracy in a\ndiverse group of sequential tasks. For instance, applying the proposed model to\nsentiment analysis on IMDB review dataset reaches 89.4% test accuracy within 5\nepochs, accompanied by over 35x reduction in the model size compared to LSTM.\nThe proposed novel RNN architecture is well poised for intelligent sequential\nprocessing in resource constrained hardware.",

The root cause of successful exploitation lies\nin emergent functionality introduced when programs are compiled and loaded in\nmemory for execution, called `Weird Machines' (WMs). Essentially WMs are\nunexpected virtual machines that execute attackers' bytecode, complicating\nmalware analysis whenever the bytecode set is unknown. We take the direction\nthat WM bytecode is best understood at the level of the process memory layout\nattained by exploit execution. Each step building towards this memory layout\ncomprises an exploit primitive, an exploit's basic building block. This work\npresents a WM reconstruction algorithm that works by identifying pre-defined\nexploit primitive-related behaviour during the dynamic analysis of target\nbinaries, associating it with the responsible exploit segment - the WM\nbytecode. In this manner any analyst familiar with exploit programming will\nimmediately recognise the reconstructed WM bytecode's semantics.

We first present a review of several application-oriented\nexplorations of EMT in the literature, assimilating them into half a dozen\nbroad categories according to their respective application areas. Within each\ncategory, the fundamental motivations for multitasking are discussed, together\nwith an illustrative case study. Second, we present a set of recipes by which\ngeneral problem formulations of practical interest, those that cut across\ndifferent disciplines, could be transformed in the new light of EMT.

Moreover, to solve the\nproblem in a way of analogy, an analogy module and a reasoning module with a\ncopy mechanism are proposed to model the interrelationship between the problem\nand each retrieved question.

In this paper, we\npresent a detailed measurement study that compares three major\nvideoconferencing systems: Zoom, Webex and Google Meet. Our study is based on\n48 hours' worth of more than 700 videoconferencing sessions, which were created\nwith a mix of emulated videoconferencing clients deployed in the cloud, as well\nas real mobile devices running from a residential network. We find that the\nexisting videoconferencing systems vary in terms of geographic scope, which in\nturns determines streaming lag experienced by users. We also observe that\nstreaming rate can change under different conditions (e.g., number of users in\na session, mobile device status, etc), which affects user-perceived streaming\nquality. Beyond these findings, our measurement methodology can enable\nreproducible benchmark analysis for any types of comparative or longitudinal\nstudy on available videoconferencing systems.",

Approximately 61 million adults\nover 30 suffer from periodontitis (42.2%), with 7.8% having severe\nperiodontitis in the United States. The measurement of radiographic bone loss\n(RBL) is necessary to make a correct periodontal diagnosis, especially if the\ncomprehensive and longitudinal periodontal mapping is unavailable. However,\ndoctors can interpret X-rays differently depending on their experience and\nknowledge. Computerized diagnosis support for doctors sheds light on making the\ndiagnosis with high accuracy and consistency and drawing up an appropriate\ntreatment plan for preventing or controlling periodontitis. We developed an\nend-to-end deep learning network HYNETS (Hybrid NETwork for pEriodoNTiTiS\nSTagES from radiograpH) by integrating segmentation and classification tasks\nfor grading periodontitis from periapical radiographic images. HYNETS leverages\na multi-task learning strategy by combining a set of segmentation networks and\na classification network to provide an end-to-end interpretable solution and\nhighly accurate and consistent results. HYNETS achieved the average dice\ncoefficient of 0.96 and 0.94 for the bone area and tooth segmentation and the\naverage AUC of 0.97 for periodontitis stage assignment. Additionally,\nconventional image processing techniques provide RBL measurements and build\ntransparency and trust in the model's prediction.

We want to start in a region of weight space a) with low loss\nvalue, b) that is favourable for second-order optimization, and c) where the\nconjugate-gradient (CG) calculations can be performed quickly. For margin\nlosses, such an initialization is achieved by selecting the initial vector such\nthat it separates the mean of all positive (relevant for a label) instances\nfrom the mean of all negatives -- two quantities that can be calculated quickly\nfor the highly imbalanced binary problems occurring in XMC. We demonstrate a\nspeedup of $\\approx 3\\times$ for training with squared hinge loss on a variety\nof XMC datasets. This comes in part from the reduced number of iterations that\nneed to be performed due to starting closer to the solution, and in part from\nan implicit negative mining effect that allows to ignore easy negatives in the\nCG step. Because of the convex nature of the optimization problem, the speedup\nis achieved without any degradation in classification accuracy.",

In practice it is not always possible to sample functions at optimal\nnodes with a low-order Lebesgue constant. Therefore, we go beyond classical\ninterpolatory quadrature by lowering the degree of the polynomial approximant\nand by applying auxiliary mapping functions that map the original quadrature\nnodes to more suitable fake nodes. More precisely, we investigate the\ncombination of the Kosloff Tal-Ezer map and Least-squares approximation (KTL)\nfor numerical quadrature: a careful selection of the mapping parameter $\\alpha$\nensures a high accuracy of the approximation and, at the same time, an\nasymptotically optimal ratio between the degree of the polynomial and the\nspacing of the grid. We will investigate the properties of this KTL quadrature\nand focus on the symmetry of the quadrature weights, the limit relations for\n$\\alpha$ converging to $0^{+}$ and $1^{-}$, as well as the computation of the\nquadrature weights in the standard monomial and in the Chebyshev bases with\nhelp of a cosine transform. Numerical tests on equispaced nodes show that some\nstatic choices of the map's parameter improve the results of the composite\ntrapezoidal rule, while a dynamic approach achieves larger stability and faster\nconvergence, even when the sampling nodes are perturbed.

It employs logs to back up arriving KV pairs and\nmaintains a few on-disk levels with exponentially increasing capacity limits,\nresembling a tiered tree-like structure. A level comprises SST files, each of\nwhich holds a sequence of sorted KV pairs. From time to time, LSM-tree\nredeploys KV pairs from a full level to the lower level by compaction, which\nmerge-sorts and moves KV pairs among SST files, thereby incurring substantial\ndisk I/Os.\nIn this paper, we revisit the design of LSM-tree and find that organizing\nmultiple KV pairs in an SST file entails the heavyweight redeployment of actual\nKV pairs in a compaction. Accordingly we revolutionize the organization of KV\npairs by transforming an SST file of KV pairs to an SST directory, in which\neach KV pair makes into an independent KV file with the key and value as\nfilename and main file contents, respectively. Moving KV pairs in a compaction\nconverts to transferring directory entries (dentrys), which causes concretely\nfewer disk I/Os. This is the essence of our design named DeLSM.

This controller is\ntrained entirely in simulation, but transfers easily to real trees via a neural\nnetwork which transforms raw images into a simplified, segmented\nrepresentation. Once contact is established, the system hands over control to\nan interaction controller that guides the cutter pivot point to the branch\nwhile minimizing interaction forces.

Along this line, this study aims to develop a spatial deduction\nmodel to obtain the full-faced mechanical behaviors through integrating\nmechanical properties into pure data-driven model. The spatial tunnel structure\nis divided into many parts and reconstructed in a form of matrix. Then, the\nexternal load applied on structure in the field was considered to study the\nmechanical behaviors of tunnel. Based on the limited observed monitoring data\nin matrix and mechanical analysis results, a double-driven model was developed\nto obtain the full-faced information, in which the data-driven model was the\ndominant one and the mechanical constraint was the secondary one. To verify the\npresented spatial deduction model, cross-test was conducted through assuming\npartial monitoring data are unknown and regarding them as testing points. The\nwell agreement between deduction results with actual monitoring results means\nthe proposed model is reasonable. Therefore, it was employed to deduct both the\ncurrent and historical performance of tunnel full face, which is crucial to\nprevent structural disasters.",

Many\nrecent TCP studies employ various Machine Learning (ML) techniques to deal with\nthe dynamic and complex nature of CI.

Third, we develop\nmethods and tools to collect the defined features for 25 open-source software\nsystems with enough failed builds whose regression testing takes at least five\nminutes.

The results show that a background\nsubtraction-based method can achieve good detection performance on RGB images\n(F1 scores around 0.9 for most cases), and a more varied performance is seen on\nthermal images with different azimuth angles.

As millions of papers come out\nevery year in the biomedical domain, automatically discovering DTI knowledge\nfrom biomedical literature, which are usually triplets about drugs, targets and\ntheir interaction, becomes an urgent demand in the industry. Existing methods\nof discovering biological knowledge are mainly extractive approaches that often\nrequire detailed annotations (e.g., all mentions of biological entities,\nrelations between every two entity mentions, etc.). However, it is difficult\nand costly to obtain sufficient annotations due to the requirement of expert\nknowledge from biomedical domains. To overcome these difficulties, we explore\nthe first end-to-end solution for this task by using generative approaches. We\nregard the DTI triplets as a sequence and use a Transformer-based model to\ndirectly generate them without using the detailed annotations of entities and\nrelations. Further, we propose a semi-supervised method, which leverages the\naforementioned end-to-end model to filter unlabeled literature and label them.\nExperimental results show that our method significantly outperforms extractive\nbaselines on DTI discovery.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have become larger over the years with increasing demand\nof computational resources for inference; incurring exacerbate costs and\nleaving little room for deployment on devices with limited battery and other\nresources for real-time applications. The multi-exit architectures are type of\ndeep neural network that are interleaved with several output (or exit) layers\nat varying depths of the model. They provide a sound approach for improving\ncomputational time and energy utilization of running a model through producing\npredictions from early exits. In this work, we present a novel and\narchitecture-agnostic approach for robust training of multi-exit architectures\ntermed consistent exit training. The crux of the method lies in a\nconsistency-based objective to enforce prediction invariance over clean and\nperturbed inputs. We leverage weak supervision to align model output with\nconsistency training and jointly optimize dual-losses in a multi-task learning\nfashion over the exits in a network. Our technique enables exit layers to\ngeneralize better when confronted with increasing uncertainty, hence, resulting\nin superior quality-efficiency trade-offs.

    "abstract": "Real-time end-to-end task scheduling in networked control systems (NCSs)\nrequires the joint consideration of both network and computing resources to\nguarantee the desired quality of service (QoS). This paper introduces a new\nmodel for composite resource scheduling (CRS) in real-time networked control\nsystems, which considers a strict execution order of sensing, computing, and\nactuating segments based on the control loop of the target NCS. We prove that\nthe general CRS problem is NP-hard and study two special cases of the CRS\nproblem. The first case restricts the computing and actuating segments to have\nunit-size execution time while the second case assumes that both sensing and\nactuating segments have unit-size execution time. We propose an optimal\nalgorithm to solve the first case by checking the intervals with 100% network\nresource utilization and modify the deadlines of the tasks within those\nintervals to prune the search. For the second case, we propose another optimal\nalgorithm based on a novel backtracking strategy to check the time intervals\nwith the network resource utilization larger than 100% and modify the timing\nparameters of tasks based on these intervals. For the general case, we design a\ngreedy strategy to modify the timing parameters of both network segments and\ncomputing segments within the time intervals that have network and computing\nresource utilization larger than 100%, respectively. The correctness and\neffectiveness of the proposed algorithms are verified through extensive\nexperiments.",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art deep learning classifiers are heavily overparameterized with\nrespect to the amount of training examples and observed to generalize well on\n\"clean\" data, but be highly susceptible to infinitesmal adversarial\nperturbations. In this paper, we identify an overparameterized linear ensemble,\nthat uses the \"lifted\" Fourier feature map, that demonstrates both of these\nbehaviors. The input is one-dimensional, and the adversary is only allowed to\nperturb these inputs and not the non-linear features directly. We find that the\nlearned model is susceptible to adversaries in an intermediate regime where\nclassification generalizes but regression does not. Notably, the susceptibility\narises despite the absence of model mis-specification or label noise, which are\ncommonly cited reasons for adversarial-susceptibility. These results are\nextended theoretically to a random-Fourier-sum setup that exhibits\ndouble-descent behavior. In both feature-setups, the adversarial vulnerability\narises because of a phenomenon we term spatial localization: the predictions of\nthe learned model are markedly more sensitive in the vicinity of training\npoints than elsewhere. This sensitivity is a consequence of feature lifting and\nis reminiscent of Gibb's and Runge's phenomena from signal processing and\nfunctional analysis. Despite the adversarial susceptibility, we find that\nclassification with these features can be easier than the more commonly studied\n\"independent feature\" models.",

We use the common class\ndiscretization for stress, dividing its continuous values into three classes:\nlow, medium, and high. We design and evaluate three computer vision modeling\napproaches to classify the driver's stress levels: (1) object presence\nfeatures, where features are computed using automatic scene segmentation; (2)\nend-to-end image classification; and (3) end-to-end video classification. All\nthree approaches show promising results, suggesting that it is possible to\napproximate the drivers' subjective stress from the information found in the\nvisual scene.

Conventional 2D CNNs are computationally\ncheap but cannot capture temporal relationships; 3D CNN-based methods can\nachieve good performance but are computationally intensive. In this paper, we\npropose a generic and effective Temporal Shift Module (TSM) that enjoys both\nhigh efficiency and high performance. The key idea of TSM is to shift part of\nthe channels along the temporal dimension, thus facilitate information\nexchanged among neighboring frames. It can be inserted into 2D CNNs to achieve\ntemporal modeling at zero computation and zero parameters. TSM offers several\nunique advantages. Firstly, TSM has high performance; it ranks the first on the\nSomething-Something leaderboard upon submission. Secondly, TSM has high\nefficiency; it achieves a high frame rate of 74fps and 29fps for online video\nrecognition on Jetson Nano and Galaxy Note8. Thirdly, TSM has higher\nscalability compared to 3D networks, enabling large-scale Kinetics training on\n1,536 GPUs in 15 minutes. Lastly, TSM enables action concepts learning, which\n2D networks cannot model; we visualize the category attention map and find that\nspatial-temporal action detector emerges during the training of classification\ntasks.

However, these\ndatasets have ethical and technical shortcomings, such as containing personal\ninformation taken without consent, unclear license usage, biases, and, in some\ncases, even problematic image content. On the other hand, state-of-the-art\npretraining is nowadays obtained with unsupervised methods, meaning that\nlabelled datasets such as ImageNet may not be necessary, or perhaps not even\noptimal, for model pretraining. We thus propose an unlabelled dataset PASS:\nPictures without humAns for Self-Supervision. PASS only contains images with\nCC-BY license and complete attribution metadata, addressing the copyright\nissue. Most importantly, it contains no images of people at all, and also\navoids other types of images that are problematic for data protection or\nethics. We show that PASS can be used for pretraining with methods such as\nMoCo-v2, SwAV and DINO. In the transfer learning setting, it yields similar\ndownstream performances to ImageNet pretraining even on tasks that involve\nhumans, such as human pose estimation. PASS does not make existing datasets\nobsolete, as for instance it is insufficient for benchmarking. However, it\nshows that model pretraining is often possible while using safer data, and it\nalso provides the basis for a more robust evaluation of pretraining methods.",

The percentage of RBL was calculated to determine the\nstage of RBL for each tooth. A provisional periodontal diagnosis was assigned\nusing the 2018 periodontitis classification. RBL percentage, staging, and\npresumptive diagnosis were compared to the measurements and diagnoses made by\nthe independent examiners.\nResults: The average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) for segmentation was\nover 0.91. There was no significant difference in RBL percentage measurements\ndetermined by DL and examiners (p=0.65). The Area Under the Receiver Operating\nCharacteristics Curve of RBL stage assignment for stage I, II and III was 0.89,\n0.90 and 0.90, respectively. The accuracy of the case diagnosis was 0.85.\nConclusion: The proposed DL model provides reliable RBL measurements and\nimage-based periodontal diagnosis using periapical radiographic images.\nHowever, this model has to be further optimized and validated by a larger\nnumber of images to facilitate its application.",

This\ncasts great challenges to deep neural network (DNN) based blind IQA (BIQA),\nwhich requires large-scale training data that is representative of the natural\nimage distribution. It is extremely difficult to create human-rated IQA\ndatasets composed of millions of images due to constraints of subjective\ntesting. While a number of efforts have focused on design innovations to\nenhance the performance of DNN based BIQA, attempts to address the scarcity of\nlabeled IQA data remain surprisingly missing. To address this data challenge,\nwe construct so far the largest IQA database, namely Waterloo Exploration-II,\nwhich contains 3,570 pristine reference and around 3.45 million singly and\nmultiply distorted images. Since subjective testing for such a large dataset is\nnearly impossible, we develop a novel mechanism that synthetically assigns\nperceptual quality labels to the distorted images. We construct a DNN-based\nBIQA model called EONSS, train it on Waterloo Exploration-II, and test it on\nnine subject-rated IQA datasets, without any retraining or fine-tuning. The\nresults show that with a straightforward DNN architecture, EONSS is able to\noutperform the very state-of-the-art in BIQA, both in terms of quality\nprediction performance and execution speed. This study strongly supports the\nview that the quantity and quality of meaningfully annotated training data,\nrather than a sophisticated network architecture or training strategy, is the\ndominating factor that determines the performance of DNN-based BIQA models.\n(Note: Since this is an ongoing project, the final versions of Waterloo\nExploration-II database, quality annotations, and EONSS, will be made publicly\navailable in the future when it culminates.)",

Recently, deep learning methods have shown\nstate-of-the-art performance for segmenting these structures.

To overcome this problem, domain adaptation is an\neffective way to leverage information from source domain to obtain accurate\nsegmentations without requiring manual labels in target domain. In this paper,\nwe propose an unsupervised learning framework to segment the VS and cochlea.\nOur framework leverages information from contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (ceT1-w)\nMRIs and its labels, and produces segmentations for T2-weighted MRIs without\nany labels in the target domain.

    "abstract": "Background: The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, was first detected in the United\nStates in January 2020. To curb the spread of the disease in mid-March,\ndifferent states issued mandatory stay-at-home (SAH) orders. These\nnonpharmaceutical interventions were mandated based on prior experiences, such\nas the 1918 influenza epidemic. Hence, we decided to study the impact of\nrestrictions on mobility on reducing COVID-19 transmission. Methods: We\ndesigned an ecological time series study with our exposure variable as Mobility\npatterns in the state of Maryland for March- December 2020 and our outcome\nvariable as the COVID-19 hospitalizations for the same period. We built an\nExtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) ensemble machine learning model and\nregressed the lagged COVID-19 hospitalizations with Mobility volume for\ndifferent regions of Maryland. Results: We found an 18% increase in COVID-19\nhospitalizations when mobility was increased by a factor of five, similarly a\n43% increase when mobility was further increased by a factor of ten.\nConclusion: The findings of our study demonstrated a positive linear\nrelationship between mobility and the incidence of COVID-19 cases. These\nfindings are partially consistent with other studies suggesting the benefits of\nmobility restrictions. Although more detailed approach is needed to precisely\nunderstand the benefits and limitations of mobility restrictions as part of a\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "The primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) algorithm is a first-order method that\nsplits convex optimization problems with saddle-point structure into smaller\nsubproblems. Those subproblems, unlike those obtained from most other splitting\nmethods, can generally be solved efficiently because they involve simple\noperations such as matrix-vector multiplications or proximal mappings that are\neasy to evaluate. In order to work fast, however, the PDHG algorithm requires\nstepsize parameters fine-tuned for the problem at hand. Unfortunately, the\nstepsize parameters must often be estimated from quantities that are\nprohibitively expensive to compute for large-scale optimization problems, such\nas those in machine learning. In this paper, we introduce accelerated nonlinear\nvariants of the PDHG algorithm that can achieve, for a broad class of\noptimization problems relevant to machine learning, an optimal rate of\nconvergence with stepsize parameters that are simple to compute. We prove\nrigorous convergence results, including for problems posed on\ninfinite-dimensional reflexive Banach spaces.

    "abstract": "We study the linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control problem, in which the\ncontroller's observation of the system state is such that a desired cost is\nunattainable. To achieve the desired LQG cost, we introduce a communication\nlink from the observer (encoder) to the controller. We investigate the optimal\ntrade-off between the improved LQG cost and the consumed communication\n(information) resources, measured with the conditional directed information,\nacross all encoding-decoding policies. The main result is a semidefinite\nprogramming formulation for that optimization problem in the finite-horizon\nscenario, which applies to time-varying linear dynamical systems. This result\nextends a seminal work by Tanaka et al., where the only information the\ncontroller knows about the system state arrives via a communication channel, to\nthe scenario where the controller has also access to a noisy observation of the\nsystem state. As part of our derivation to show the optimiality of an encoder\nthat transmits a memoryless Gaussian measurement of the state, we show that the\npresence of the controller's observations at the encoder can not reduce the\nminimal directed information. For time-invariant systems, where the optimal\npolicy may be time-varying, we show in the infinite-horizon scenario that the\noptimal policy is time-invariant and can be computed explicitly from a solution\nof a finite-dimensional semidefinite programming. The results are demonstrated\nvia examples that show that even low-quality measurements can have a\nsignificant impact on the required communication resources.",

    "abstract": "Particle settling in inclined channels is an important phenomenon that occurs\nduring hydraulic fracturing of shale gas production. Generally, in order to\naccurately simulate the large-scale (field-scale) proppant transport process,\nconstructing a fast and accurate sub-scale proppant settling model, or\nsurrogate model, becomes a critical issue, since mapping between physical\nparameters and proppant settling velocity is complex. Previously, particle\nsettling has usually been investigated via high-fidelity experiments and\nmeso-scale numerical simulations, both of which are time-consuming. In this\nwork, a new method is proposed and utilized, i.e., the multi-fidelity neural\nnetwork (MFNN), to construct a settling surrogate model, which could utilize\nboth high-fidelity and low-fidelity (thus, less expensive) data. The results\ndemonstrate that constructing the settling surrogate with the MFNN can reduce\nthe need for high-fidelity data and thus computational cost by 80%, while the\naccuracy lost is less than 5% compared to a high-fidelity surrogate. Moreover,\nthe investigated particle settling surrogate is applied in macro-scale proppant\ntransport simulation, which shows that the settling model is significant to\nproppant transport and yields accurate results.

The\nfeatures we propose have a direct biological interpretation: They measure the\ndeformation caused by the tumor on the surrounding brain structures, comparing\nthe shape of various structures in the patient's brain to their expected shape\nin healthy individuals. To obtain the required segmentations, we use an\nautomatic method that is contrast-adaptive and robust to missing modalities,\nmaking the features generalizable across scanners and imaging protocols. Since\nthe features we propose do not depend on characteristics of the tumor region\nitself, they are also applicable to post-operative images, which have been much\nless studied in the context of survival prediction.

    "abstract": "Registration of brain MRI images requires to solve a deformation field, which\nis extremely difficult in aligning intricate brain tissues, e.g., subcortical\nnuclei, etc. Existing efforts resort to decomposing the target deformation\nfield into intermediate sub-fields with either tiny motions, i.e., progressive\nregistration stage by stage, or lower resolutions, i.e., coarse-to-fine\nestimation of the full-size deformation field. In this paper, we argue that\nthose efforts are not mutually exclusive, and propose a unified framework for\nrobust brain MRI registration in both progressive and coarse-to-fine manners\nsimultaneously. Specifically, building on a dual-encoder U-Net, the\nfixed-moving MRI pair is encoded and decoded into multi-scale deformation\nsub-fields from coarse to fine. Each decoding block contains two proposed novel\nmodules: i) in Deformation Field Integration (DFI), a single integrated\nsub-field is calculated, warping by which is equivalent to warping\nprogressively by sub-fields from all previous decoding blocks, and ii) in\nNon-rigid Feature Fusion (NFF), features of the fixed-moving pair are aligned\nby DFI-integrated sub-field, and then fused to predict a finer sub-field.\nLeveraging both DFI and NFF, the target deformation field is factorized into\nmulti-scale sub-fields, where the coarser fields alleviate the estimate of a\nfiner one and the finer field learns to make up those misalignments insolvable\nby previous coarser ones.

This study introduces an\nimportant missing dimension - computational fairness - to travel behavior\nanalysis. We first operationalize computational fairness by equality of\nopportunity, then differentiate between the bias inherent in data and the bias\nintroduced by modeling. We then demonstrate the prediction disparities in\ntravel behavior modeling using the 2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS)\nand the 2018-2019 My Daily Travel Survey in Chicago. Empirically, deep neural\nnetwork (DNN) and discrete choice models (DCM) reveal consistent prediction\ndisparities across multiple social groups: both over-predict the false negative\nrate of frequent driving for the ethnic minorities, the low-income and the\ndisabled populations, and falsely predict a higher travel burden of the\nsocially disadvantaged groups and the rural populations than reality. Comparing\nDNN with DCM, we find that DNN can outperform DCM in prediction disparities\nbecause of DNN's smaller misspecification error. To mitigate prediction\ndisparities, this study introduces an absolute correlation regularization\nmethod, which is evaluated with synthetic and real-world data. The results\ndemonstrate the prevalence of prediction disparities in travel behavior\nmodeling, and the disparities still persist regarding a variety of model\nspecifics such as the number of DNN layers, batch size and weight\ninitialization. Since these prediction disparities can exacerbate social\ninequity if prediction results without fairness adjustment are used for\ntransportation policy making, we advocate for careful consideration of the\nfairness problem in travel behavior modeling, and the use of bias mitigation\nalgorithms for fair transport decisions.",

Our analyses suggest an intriguing experimentally testable\nhypothesis for tracking plumes in changing wind direction -- that agents follow\nlocal plume shape rather than the current wind direction. While reflexive\nshort-memory behaviors are sufficient for tracking plumes in constant wind,\nlonger timescales of memory are essential for tracking plumes that switch\ndirection. At the level of neural dynamics, the RNNs' population activity is\nlow-dimensional and organized into distinct dynamical structures, with some\ncorrespondence to behavioral modules. Our in silico approach provides key\nintuitions for turbulent plume tracking strategies and motivates future\ntargeted experimental and theoretical developments.",

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation in surgical videos is a prerequisite for a broad range\nof applications towards improving surgical outcomes and surgical video\nanalysis. However, semantic segmentation in surgical videos involves many\nchallenges. In particular, in cataract surgery, various features of the\nrelevant objects such as blunt edges, color and context variation, reflection,\ntransparency, and motion blur pose a challenge for semantic segmentation. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel convolutional module termed as \\textit{ReCal}\nmodule, which can calibrate the feature maps by employing region\nintra-and-inter-dependencies and channel-region cross-dependencies. This\ncalibration strategy can effectively enhance semantic representation by\ncorrelating different representations of the same semantic label, considering a\nmulti-angle local view centering around each pixel. Thus the proposed module\ncan deal with distant visual characteristics of unique objects as well as\ncross-similarities in the visual characteristics of different objects.\nMoreover, we propose a novel network architecture based on the proposed module\ntermed as ReCal-Net. Experimental results confirm the superiority of ReCal-Net\ncompared to rival state-of-the-art approaches for all relevant objects in\ncataract surgery. Moreover, ablation studies reveal the effectiveness of the\nReCal module in boosting semantic segmentation accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale deployment of connected vehicles with cooperative awareness\ntechnologies increases the demand for vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication\nspectrum in 5.9 GHz that is mainly allocated for the exchange of safety\nmessages. To supplement V2X communication and support the high data rates\nneeded by broadband applications, the millimeter-wave (mmWave) automotive radar\nspectrum at 76-81 GHz can be utilized. For this purpose, joint\nradar-communication systems have been proposed in the literature to perform\nboth functions using the same waveform and hardware. While multiple-input and\nmultiple-output (MIMO) communication with multiple users enables independent\ndata streaming for high throughput, MIMO radar processing provides\nhigh-resolution imaging that is crucial for safety-critical systems. However,\nemploying conventional precoding methods designed for communication generates\ndirectional beams that impair MIMO radar imaging and target tracking\ncapabilities during data streaming. In this paper, we propose a MIMO joint\nautomotive radar-communication (JARC) framework based on orthogonal frequency\ndivision multiplexing (OFDM) waveform. First, we show that the MIMO-OFDM\npreamble can be exploited for both MIMO radar processing and estimation of the\ncommunication channel. Then, we propose an optimal precoder design method that\nenables high accuracy target tracking while transmitting independent data\nstreams to multiple receivers. The proposed methods provide high-resolution\nradar imaging and high throughput capabilities for MIMO JARC networks.

Two testing policies, effective during the onset of an\nepidemic when no treatment or vaccine is available, are devised: (i)\nbest-effort strategy for testing (BEST) and (ii) constant optimal strategy for\ntesting (COST).

    "abstract": "Recent studies have witnessed the effectiveness of 3D convolutions on\nsegmenting volumetric medical images. Compared with the 2D counterparts, 3D\nconvolutions can capture the spatial context in three dimensions. Nevertheless,\nmodels employing 3D convolutions introduce more trainable parameters and are\nmore computationally complex, which may lead easily to model overfitting\nespecially for medical applications with limited available training data. This\npaper aims to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of 3D convolutions by\nintroducing a novel Group Shift Pointwise Convolution (GSP-Conv). GSP-Conv\nsimplifies 3D convolutions into pointwise ones with 1x1x1 kernels, which\ndramatically reduces the number of model parameters and FLOPs (e.g. 27x fewer\nthan 3D convolutions with 3x3x3 kernels). Na\\\"ive pointwise convolutions with\nlimited receptive fields cannot make full use of the spatial image context. To\naddress this problem, we propose a parameter-free operation, Group Shift (GS),\nwhich shifts the feature maps along with different spatial directions in an\nelegant way. With GS, pointwise convolutions can access features from different\nspatial locations, and the limited receptive fields of pointwise convolutions\ncan be compensated. We evaluate the proposed methods on two datasets, PROMISE12\nand BraTS18. Results show that our method, with substantially decreased model\ncomplexity, achieves comparable or even better performance than models\nemploying 3D convolutions.",

An essential step of RT planning is the accurate\nsegmentation of various organs-at-risks (OARs) in HaN CT images. Nevertheless,\nsegmenting OARs manually is time-consuming, tedious, and error-prone\nconsidering that typical HaN CT images contain tens to hundreds of slices.\nAutomated segmentation algorithms are urgently required. Recently,\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been extensively investigated on this\ntask. Particularly, 3D CNNs are frequently adopted to process 3D HaN CT images.\nThere are two issues with na\\\"ive 3D CNNs. First, the depth resolution of 3D CT\nimages is usually several times lower than the in-plane resolution. Direct\nemployment of 3D CNNs without distinguishing this difference can lead to the\nextraction of distorted image features and influence the final segmentation\nperformance. Second, a severe class imbalance problem exists, and large organs\ncan be orders of times larger than small organs. It is difficult to\nsimultaneously achieve accurate segmentation for all the organs. To address\nthese issues, we propose a novel hybrid CNN that fuses 2D and 3D convolutions\nto combat the different spatial resolutions and extract effective edge and\nsemantic features from 3D HaN CT images. To accommodate large and small organs,\nour final model, named OrganNet2.5D, consists of only two instead of the\nclassic four downsampling operations, and hybrid dilated convolutions are\nintroduced to maintain the respective field. Experiments on the MICCAI 2015\nchallenge dataset demonstrate that OrganNet2.5D achieves promising performance\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods.",

These models were later supported by\nneurophysiological experiments using monkeys and neuroimaging experiments\ninvolving humans. These early studies influenced neuroscience from basic,\nsensory-motor control to higher cognitive functions. One of the most perplexing\nenigmas related to internal models is to understand the neural mechanisms that\nenable animals to learn large-dimensional problems with so few trials.\nConsciousness and metacognition -- the ability to monitor one's own thoughts,\nmay be part of the solution to this enigma. Based on literature reviews of the\npast 20 years, here we propose a computational neuroscience model of\nmetacognition. The model comprises a modular hierarchical\nreinforcement-learning architecture of parallel and layered, generative-inverse\nmodel pairs. In the prefrontal cortex, a distributed executive network called\nthe \"cognitive reality monitoring network\" (CRMN) orchestrates conscious\ninvolvement of generative-inverse model pairs in perception and action. Based\non mismatches between computations by generative and inverse models, as well as\nreward prediction errors, CRMN computes a \"responsibility signal\" that gates\nselection and learning of pairs in perception, action, and reinforcement\nlearning. A high responsibility signal is given to the pairs that best capture\nthe external world, that are competent in movements (small mismatch), and that\nare capable of reinforcement learning (small reward prediction error). CRMN\nselects pairs with higher responsibility signals as objects of metacognition,\nand consciousness is determined by the entropy of responsibility signals across\nall pairs.",

It is a two-pass\ndecoding model decomposing the overall task into ASR and machine translation\nsub-tasks. However, the decoding speed is not fast enough for real-world\napplications because it conducts beam search for both sub-tasks during\ninference. We propose Fast-MD, a fast MD model that generates HI by\nnon-autoregressive (NAR) decoding based on connectionist temporal\nclassification (CTC) outputs followed by an ASR decoder. We investigated two\ntypes of NAR HI: (1) parallel HI by using an autoregressive Transformer ASR\ndecoder and (2) masked HI by using Mask-CTC, which combines CTC and the\nconditional masked language model. To reduce a mismatch in the ASR decoder\nbetween teacher-forcing during training and conditioning on CTC outputs during\ntesting, we also propose sampling CTC outputs during training. Experimental\nevaluations on three corpora show that Fast-MD achieved about 2x and 4x faster\ndecoding speed than that of the na\\\"ive MD model on GPU and CPU with comparable\ntranslation quality.

In this thesis, we address the question, whether it is possible to\nconstruct a continuous-time quantum walk on general directed graphs, preserving\nits propagation properties. Secondly, the quantum spatial search defined\nthrough CTQW has been proven to work well on various undirected graphs.\nHowever, most of these graphs have very simple structures. The most advanced\nresults concerned the Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi model of random graphs, which is the\nmost popular but not realistic random graph model, and Barab\\'asi-Albert random\ngraphs, for which full quadratic speed-up was not confirmed. In the scope of\nthis aspect we analyze, whether quantum speed-up is observed for complicated\ngraph structures as well.",

Their core building blocks are\nDynamic Alignment Units (DAUs), which are optimised to transform their inputs\nwith dynamically computed weight vectors that align with task-relevant\npatterns. As a result, CoDA Nets model the classification prediction through a\nseries of input-dependent linear transformations, allowing for linear\ndecomposition of the output into individual input contributions. Given the\nalignment of the DAUs, the resulting contribution maps align with\ndiscriminative input patterns. These model-inherent decompositions are of high\nvisual quality and outperform existing attribution methods under quantitative\nmetrics. Further, CoDA Nets constitute performant classifiers, achieving on par\nresults to ResNet and VGG models on e.g. CIFAR-10 and TinyImagenet. Lastly,\nCoDA Nets can be combined with conventional neural network models to yield\npowerful classifiers that more easily scale to complex datasets such as\nImagenet whilst exhibiting an increased interpretable depth, i.e., the output\ncan be explained well in terms of contributions from intermediate layers within\nthe network.",

Second, we prove a spectral gap based mixing\ntime lower bound for reversible MCMC algorithms on general state spaces. We\napply this lower bound result to construct a hard distribution for which MALA\nrequires at least $\\tilde \\Omega (\\kappa \\sqrt{d})$ steps to mix.

Our machine learning model, built using simple\ncomponents and following a few well established practices, is capable of\nlearning latent representations of the transport process substantially closer\nto the ground truth than expected from the nominal error characterising the\ndata, leading to sound generalisation properties. This is demonstrated through\nan idealized study of the long standing problem of heat flux suppression under\nconditions relevant for fusion and cosmic plasmas. A simple analysis shows that\nthe result applies beyond those case specific assumptions and that, in\nparticular, the accuracy of the learned representation is controllable through\nknowledge of the data quality (error properties) and a suitable choice of the\ndataset size. While the learned representation can be used as a plug-in for\nnumerical modeling purposes, it can also be leveraged with the above error\nanalysis to obtain reliable mathematical expressions describing the transport\nmechanism and of great theoretical value.",

The SOF setting can be quite\ncommon, for example, when there are unmodeled hidden states in the underlying\nprocess. We first identify several important properties of the SOF cost\nfunction, including coercivity, L-smoothness, and M-Lipschitz continuous\nHessian. Based on these results, we show that when the observation matrix has\nfull column rank, gradient descent is able to converge to the global optimal\ncontroller at a linear rate. For the partially observed case, convergence to\nstationary points is obtained in general and the corresponding convergence rate\nis characterized. In the latter more challenging case, we further prove that\nunder some mild conditions, gradient descent converges linearly to a local\nminimum if the starting point is close to one. These results not only\ncharacterize the performance of gradient descent in optimizing the SOF problem,\nbut also shed light on the efficiency of general policy gradient methods in\nreinforcement learning.",

While embedded artificial intelligence\ncan greatly benefit from such functionality, a practical demonstration in\nhardware is still missing. Here, we show how the intrinsic properties of\nmetal-oxide volatile memristors emulate the hidden processes that support\nbiological palimpsest consolidation.

The synapses can also implement familiarity detection of previously\nforgotten memories. Crucially, palimpsest operation is achieved automatically\nand without the need for specialised instructions.

In recent years, the rise of video gameplay is\nunprecedented, further triggered by the lockdown imposed due to the COVID-19\npandemic. This paper presents an end-to-end stress analysis for video gaming\nstimuli using EEG. The PSD value of the Alpha and Beta bands is computed to\ncalculate the Beta-to-Alpha ratio (BAR). In this article, BAR is used to denote\nmental stress. Subjects are chosen based on various factors such as gender,\ngameplay experience, age, and BMI. EEG is recorded using Scan SynAmps2 Express\nequipment. There are three types of video gameplay: strategic, puzzle, and\ncombinational. Relaxation is accomplished in this study by the use of music of\nvarious pitches. Two types of regression analysis are done to mathematically\nmodel stress and relaxation curve.

Non-gamer subjects have\nan average BAR of 2.403 for 1 hour of strategic video gameplay, whereas gamers\nhave 2.218 BAR concurrently.
