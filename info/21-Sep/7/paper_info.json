We show, both\ntheoretically and empirically, how exploiting a given cluster structure can\nsignificantly improve the regret and computational cost compared to using\nstandard Thompson sampling. In the case of the stochastic multi-armed bandit we\ngive upper bounds on the expected cumulative regret showing how it depends on\nthe quality of the clustering.

    "title": "A Multi-view Multi-task Learning Framework for Multi-variate Time Series  Forecasting",
    "abstract": "Multi-variate time series (MTS) data is a ubiquitous class of data\nabstraction in the real world. Any instance of MTS is generated from a hybrid\ndynamical system and their specific dynamics are usually unknown. The hybrid\nnature of such a dynamical system is a result of complex external attributes,\nsuch as geographic location and time of day, each of which can be categorized\ninto either spatial attributes or temporal attributes. Therefore, there are two\nfundamental views which can be used to analyze MTS data, namely the spatial\nview and the temporal view. Moreover, from each of these two views, we can\npartition the set of data samples of MTS into disjoint forecasting tasks in\naccordance with their associated attribute values. Then, samples of the same\ntask will manifest similar forthcoming pattern, which is less sophisticated to\nbe predicted in comparison with the original single-view setting. Considering\nthis insight, we propose a novel multi-view multi-task (MVMT) learning\nframework for MTS forecasting. Instead of being explicitly presented in most\nscenarios, MVMT information is deeply concealed in the MTS data, which severely\nhinders the model from capturing it naturally. To this end, we develop two\nkinds of basic operations, namely task-wise affine transformation and task-wise\nnormalization, respectively. Applying these two operations with prior knowledge\non the spatial and temporal view allows the model to adaptively extract MVMT\ninformation while predicting. Extensive experiments on three datasets are\nconducted to illustrate that canonical architectures can be greatly enhanced by\nthe MVMT learning framework in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. In\naddition, we design rich case studies to reveal the properties of\nrepresentations produced at different phases in the entire prediction\nprocedure.",

However, it remains\none of the most underdiagnosed and undertreated conditions in ophthalmology.\nMany tests used in the diagnosis of DED rely on an experienced observer for\nimage interpretation, which may be considered subjective and result in\nvariation in diagnosis.

Powerful machine learning techniques have been\nharnessed to understand nuances in patient data and medical images, aiming for\nconsistent diagnosis and stratification of disease severity. This is the first\nliterature review on the use of AI in DED. We provide a brief introduction to\nAI, report its current use in DED research and its potential for application in\nthe clinic. Our review found that AI has been employed in a wide range of DED\nclinical tests and research applications, primarily for interpretation of\ninterferometry, slit-lamp and meibography images.

Many of the existing detection techniques focus on\nsymptoms having the same equal importance. However, it has been shown that some\nsymptoms are more prevalent than others. In this paper, we present a multimodal\nmethod to predict COVID-19 by incorporating existing deep learning classifiers\nusing convolutional neural networks and our novel probability-based weighting\nfunction that considers the prevalence of each symptom.

For networks that do not admit a polyhedral Lyapunov\nfunction, we investigate whether it is possible to enforce polyhedral\nstructural stability by applying a strong negative feedback on some pinned\nnodes: in terms of the Petri net, this is equivalent to turning pinned nodes\ninto black holes that clear any positive or negative incoming token.

    "abstract": "With the rise of the competition in the movie production market, because of\nnew players such as Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max, and Amazon Prime, whose primary\ngoal is producing a large amount of exclusive content in order to gain a\ncompetitive advantage, it is extremely important to minimize the number of\nunsuccessful titles. This paper focuses on new approaches to predict film\nsuccess, based on the movie industry community structure, and highlights the\nrole of the casting director in movie success.

    "title": "Towards Accurate Alignment in Real-time 3D Hand-Mesh Reconstruction",
    "abstract": "3D hand-mesh reconstruction from RGB images facilitates many applications,\nincluding augmented reality (AR). However, this requires not only real-time\nspeed and accurate hand pose and shape but also plausible mesh-image alignment.\nWhile existing works already achieve promising results, meeting all three\nrequirements is very challenging. This paper presents a novel pipeline by\ndecoupling the hand-mesh reconstruction task into three stages: a joint stage\nto predict hand joints and segmentation; a mesh stage to predict a rough hand\nmesh; and a refine stage to fine-tune it with an offset mesh for mesh-image\nalignment. With careful design in the network structure and in the loss\nfunctions, we can promote high-quality finger-level mesh-image alignment and\ndrive the models together to deliver real-time predictions. Extensive\nquantitative and qualitative results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the\nquality of our results outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on\nhand-mesh/pose precision and hand-image alignment. In the end, we also showcase\nseveral real-time AR scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Social media and other platforms rely on automated detection of abusive\ncontent to help combat disinformation, harassment, and abuse. One common\napproach is to check user content for similarity against a server-side database\nof problematic items. However, such method fundamentally endangers user\nprivacy. Instead, we target client-side detection, notifying only the users\nwhen such matches occur to warn them against abusive content.\nOur solution is based on privacy-preserving similarity testing. Existing\napproaches rely on expensive cryptographic protocols that do not scale well to\nlarge databases and may sacrifice the correctness of the matching. To contend\nwith this challenge, we propose and formalize the concept of similarity-based\nbucketization(SBB). With SBB, a client reveals a small amount of information to\na database-holding server so that it can generate a bucket of potentially\nsimilar items. The bucket is small enough for efficient application of\nprivacy-preserving protocols for similarity. To analyze the privacy risk of the\nrevealed information, we introduce a reasoning framework that measures an\nadversary's ability to infer a predicate about the client input with good\nconfidence. We develop a practical SBB protocol for image content, and evaluate\nits client privacy guarantee with real-world social media data. We then combine\nthe protocol with various similarity protocols, showing that SBB provides a\nspeedup of at least 29x on large-scale databases, while retaining correctness\nof over 95%.",

We implement a complex, real-world, real-time\nmonitoring application using the proposed app slice abstraction, and\ndemonstrate on a private 5G/LTE testbed that the proposed runtime system\nsignificantly improves the application performance and resource usage when\ncompared with the case where the coupling between the compute and network\nresource usage is ignored.",

Traditional data sets (e.g., CelebA, CASIA-WebFace) used for\ntraining these systems were released before the pandemic, so they now seem\nunsuited due to the lack of examples of people wearing masks. We propose a\nmethod for enhancing data sets containing faces without masks by creating\nsynthetic masks and overlaying them on faces in the original images. Our method\nrelies on Spark AR Studio, a developer program made by Facebook that is used to\ncreate Instagram face filters. In our approach, we use 9 masks of different\ncolors, shapes and fabrics.

    "abstract": "Robots learn as they interact with humans. Consider a human teleoperating an\nassistive robot arm: as the human guides and corrects the arm's motion, the\nrobot gathers information about the human's desired task. But how does the\nhuman know what their robot has inferred? Today's approaches often focus on\nconveying intent: for instance, upon legible motions or gestures to indicate\nwhat the robot is planning. However, closing the loop on robot inference\nrequires more than just revealing the robot's current policy: the robot should\nalso display the alternatives it thinks are likely, and prompt the human\nteacher when additional guidance is necessary. In this paper we propose a\nmultimodal approach for communicating robot inference that combines both\npassive and active feedback. Specifically, we leverage information-rich\naugmented reality to passively visualize what the robot has inferred, and\nattention-grabbing haptic wristbands to actively prompt and direct the human's\nteaching. We apply our system to shared autonomy tasks where the robot must\ninfer the human's goal in real-time. Within this context, we integrate passive\nand active modalities into a single algorithmic framework that determines when\nand which type of feedback to provide. Combining both passive and active\nfeedback experimentally outperforms single modality baselines; during an\nin-person user study, we demonstrate that our integrated approach increases how\nefficiently humans teach the robot while simultaneously decreasing the amount\nof time humans spend interacting with the robot.

Specifically, we conduct a study of\nhow to utilize various types and large amounts of students log data to train\naccurate machine learning models that predict the knowledge state of future\nstudents. This study is the first to use four very large datasets made\navailable recently from four distinct intelligent tutoring systems. Our results\ninclude a new machine learning approach that defines a new state of the art for\nSP modeling, improving over earlier methods in several ways: First, we achieve\nimproved accuracy by introducing new features that can be easily computed from\nconventional question-response logs (e.g., the pattern in the student's most\nrecent answers). Second, we take advantage of features of the student history\nthat go beyond question-response pairs (e.g., which video segments the student\nwatched, or skipped) as well as information about prerequisite structure in the\ncurriculum. Third, we train multiple specialized modeling models for different\naspects of the curriculum (e.g., specializing in early versus later segments of\nthe student history), then combine these specialized models to create a group\nprediction of student knowledge. Taken together, these innovations yield an\naverage AUC score across these four datasets of 0.807 compared to the previous\nbest logistic regression approach score of 0.766, and also outperforming\nstate-of-the-art deep neural net approaches. Importantly, we observe consistent\nimprovements from each of our three methodological innovations, in each\ndataset, suggesting that our methods are of general utility and likely to\nproduce improvements for other online tutoring systems as well.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale conversational assistants like Alexa, Siri, Cortana and Google\nAssistant process every utterance using multiple models for domain, intent and\nnamed entity recognition. Given the decoupled nature of model development and\nlarge traffic volumes, it is extremely difficult to identify utterances\nprocessed erroneously by such systems. We address this challenge to detect\ndomain classification errors using offline Transformer models. We combine\nutterance encodings from a RoBERTa model with the Nbest hypothesis produced by\nthe production system. We then fine-tune end-to-end in a multitask setting\nusing a small dataset of humanannotated utterances with domain classification\nerrors. We tested our approach for detecting misclassifications from one domain\nthat accounts for <0.5% of the traffic in a large-scale conversational AI\nsystem. Our approach achieves an F1 score of 30% outperforming a bi- LSTM\nbaseline by 16.9% and a standalone RoBERTa model by 4.8%. We improve this\nfurther by 2.2% to 32.2% by ensembling multiple models.",

The\nimportance of the fixed-dimensional vector representation generated by the\nsingle-head network has been demonstrated for industrial machinery condition\nmonitoring and predictive maintenance. However, processing heterogeneous sensor\nsignals with a single head may result in a model that cannot explicitly account\nfor the diversity in time-varying multivariate inputs. This work extends the\nconventional single-head deep learning models to a more robust form by\ndeveloping context-specific heads to independently capture the inherent pattern\nof each sensor reading in multivariate time series signals. Using the turbofan\naircraft engine benchmark dataset (CMAPSS), an extensive experiment is\nperformed to verify the effectiveness and benefits of multi-head fully\nconnected neurons, recurrent networks, convolution network, the\ntransformer-style stand-alone attention network, and their variants for\nremaining useful life estimation. Moreover, the effect of different attention\nmechanisms on the multi-head models is also evaluated. In addition, each\narchitecture's relative advantage and computational overhead are analyzed.\nResults show that utilizing the attention layer is task-sensitive and\nmodel-dependent, as it does not provide consistent improvement across the\nmodels investigated. The result is further compared with five state-of-the-art\nmodels, and the comparison shows that a relatively simple multi-head\narchitecture performs better than the state-of-the-art models. The results\npresented in this study demonstrate the importance of multi-head models and\nattention mechanisms to improved understanding of the remaining useful life of\nindustrial assets.",

Despite of the success of previous works,\nexplorations on an effective training strategy for the saliency network and\naccurate matches between image-level annotations and salient objects are still\ninadequate. In this work, 1) we propose a self-calibrated training strategy by\nexplicitly establishing a mutual calibration loop between pseudo labels and\nnetwork predictions, liberating the saliency network from error-prone\npropagation caused by pseudo labels. 2) we prove that even a much smaller\ndataset (merely 1.8% of ImageNet) with well-matched annotations can facilitate\nmodels to achieve better performance as well as generalizability.

This paper focuses on the embedding learning aspect of the tensor\ncompletion problem and proposes a new multi-layer neural network architecture\nfor tensor factorization and completion (MLCTR). The network architecture\nentails multiple advantages: a series of low-rank matrix factorizations (MF)\nbuilding blocks to minimize overfitting, interleaved transfer functions in each\nlayer for non-linearity, and by-pass connections to reduce the gradient\ndiminishing problem and increase the depths of neural networks.

It is furthermore observed that enhancing the message\npassing step in GCNs by adding the node feature kernel to the adjacency matrix\nof the graph structure solves this problem. An empirical study of a GCN\nutilised for node classification on six real datasets further confirms the\ntheoretical findings and demonstrates that perturbations of the graph structure\ncan result in GCNs performing significantly worse than Multi-Layer Perceptrons\nrun on the node features alone. In practice, adding a node feature kernel to\nthe message passing of perturbed graphs results in a significant improvement of\nthe GCN's performance, thereby rendering it more robust to graph perturbations.\nOur code is publicly available at:https://github.com/ChangminWu/RobustGCN.",

    "abstract": "The wide application of smart devices enables the availability of multimodal\ndata, which can be utilized in many tasks. In the field of multimodal sentiment\nanalysis (MSA), most previous works focus on exploring intra- and inter-modal\ninteractions.

Moreover,\nthe size of datasets limits the generalization ability of existing methods. To\naddress the afore-mentioned issues, we propose a novel framework HyCon for\nhybrid contrastive learning of tri-modal representation. Specifically, we\nsimultaneously perform intra-/inter-modal contrastive learning and\nsemi-contrastive learning (that is why we call it hybrid contrastive learning),\nwith which the model can fully explore cross-modal interactions, preserve\ninter-class relationships and reduce the modality gap. Besides, a refinement\nterm is devised to prevent the model falling into a sub-optimal solution.\nMoreover, HyCon can naturally generate a large amount of training pairs for\nbetter generalization and reduce the negative effect of limited datasets.\nExtensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our proposed method\noutperforms existing works.",

Lastly, the degree of highlight and non-highlight for each query\nframe is calculated as semantic similarity to its comprehensive and\nnon-highlight preferences, respectively. Besides, to alleviate the ambiguity\ndue to the incomplete annotation, a new bi-directional contrastive loss is\nproposed to ensure a compact and differentiable metric space.

It has been shown that events alone can be used for end-task learning,\n\\eg, semantic segmentation, based on encoder-decoder-like networks. However, as\nevents are sparse and mostly reflect edge information, it is difficult to\nrecover original details merely relying on the decoder.

In this paper, we propose a simple yet flexible two-stream\nframework named Dual Transfer Learning (DTL) to effectively enhance the\nperformance on the end-tasks without adding extra inference cost. The proposed\napproach consists of three parts: event to end-task learning (EEL) branch,\nevent to image translation (EIT) branch, and transfer learning (TL) module that\nsimultaneously explores the feature-level affinity information and pixel-level\nknowledge from the EIT branch to improve the EEL branch.

Each XDM typically focus on a specific\naspect that drives its processes and steps. This aspect is indicated by its\nlabel. An evaluation method called qualitative screening mode is used in this\nstudy. XDMs are analysed based on their features to determine the suitability\nor support for service-oriented solutions. Criteria used to appraise each\nmethod are taken from SOA characteristics and SOA manifesto points. Of the four\ndiscussed XDMs, business-driven development is the best-suited approach to\nimplement a service-oriented system shown by its conformity with the selected\nassessment criteria. Nevertheless, the other three XDMs have also their own\nstrengths. Model-driven development is excellent for productivity, event-driven\ndevelopment is preferential for a quick response and asynchronous work, while\ndomain-driven development is distinctive to describe problems precisely. The\noriginality of this research is in the assessment general software development\napproaches of XDMs to be applied to SOA approach.

Different from traditional vision tasks, VEA is inherently\nmore challenging since it involves a much higher level of complexity and\nambiguity in human cognitive process. Most of the existing methods adopt deep\nlearning techniques to extract general features from the whole image,\ndisregarding the specific features evoked by various emotional stimuli.\nInspired by the \\textit{Stimuli-Organism-Response (S-O-R)} emotion model in\npsychological theory, we proposed a stimuli-aware VEA method consisting of\nthree stages, namely stimuli selection (S), feature extraction (O) and emotion\nprediction (R). First, specific emotional stimuli (i.e., color, object, face)\nare selected from images by employing the off-the-shelf tools. To the best of\nour knowledge, it is the first time to introduce stimuli selection process into\nVEA in an end-to-end network. Then, we design three specific networks, i.e.,\nGlobal-Net, Semantic-Net and Expression-Net, to extract distinct emotional\nfeatures from different stimuli simultaneously. Finally, benefiting from the\ninherent structure of Mikel's wheel, we design a novel hierarchical\ncross-entropy loss to distinguish hard false examples from easy ones in an\nemotion-specific manner.

A common\napproach is to represent data objects as binary vectors, denoted \\textit{hash\ncodes}, which require little storage and enable efficient similarity search\nthrough direct indexing into a hash table or through similarity computations in\nan appropriate space. Due to the limited expressibility of hash codes, compared\nto real-valued representations, a core open challenge is how to generate hash\ncodes that well capture semantic content or latent properties using a small\nnumber of bits, while ensuring that the hash codes are distributed in a way\nthat does not reduce their search efficiency.

The dataset consists of $\\sim$45K Chinese\nconversations with $\\sim$606K utterances. Each conversation contains about $13$\nutterances with about $4$ Internet memes on average and each utterance equipped\nwith an Internet meme is annotated with the corresponding emotion. In addition,\nwe present a simple and effective method, which utilizes a unified generation\nnetwork to solve the MOD task. Experimental results demonstrate that our method\ntrained on the proposed corpus is able to achieve expressive communication\nincluding texts and memes. The corpus and models have been publicly available\nat https://github.com/lizekang/DSTC10-MOD.",

More specifically, we design\na set of empirical evaluations that compare the robustness of representations\nin discriminative and generative models against catastrophic forgetting. We\nobserve that representations learned by discriminative models are more prone to\ncatastrophic forgetting than their generative counterparts, which sheds new\nlight on the advantages of developing generative models for continual learning.\nFinally, our work opens new research pathways and possibilities to adopt\ngenerative models in continual learning beyond mere replay mechanisms.",

To survive the\ntraining in heavily cluttered scenes, we propose a scene-guided training\nstrategy to solve the 3D space ambiguity in the occluded regions and learn\nsharp boundaries for each object.

For the bipartite matching result, modifying the\napproach from [FGT], we convert the static non-zero circulation weights to\ndynamic matching-isolating weights.\nWhile reachability is in DynFOar under O(log n/loglog n) changes, no such\nbound is known for either distance or matching in any non-trivial class of\ngraphs under non-constant changes.

    "abstract": "For the MIDOG mitosis detection challenge, we created a cascade algorithm\nconsisting of a Mask-RCNN detector, followed by a classification ensemble\nconsisting of ResNet50 and DenseNet201 to refine detected mitotic candidates.\nThe MIDOG training data consists of 200 frames originating from four scanners,\nthree of which are annotated for mitotic instances with centroid annotations.\nOur main algorithmic choices are as follows: first, to enhance the\ngeneralizability of our detector and classification networks, we use a\nstate-of-the-art residual Cycle-GAN to transform each scanner domain to every\nother scanner domain. During training, we then randomly load, for each image,\none of the four domains. In this way, our networks can learn from the fourth\nnon-annotated scanner domain even if we don't have annotations for it. Second,\nfor training the detector network, rather than using centroid-based fixed-size\nbounding boxes, we create mitosis-specific bounding boxes. We do this by\nmanually annotating a small selection of mitoses, training a Mask-RCNN on this\nsmall dataset, and applying it to the rest of the data to obtain full\nannotations. We trained the follow-up classification ensemble using only the\nchallenge-provided positive and hard-negative examples. On the preliminary test\nset, the algorithm scores an F1 score of 0.7578, putting us as the second-place\nteam on the leaderboard.",

Retrieval data\nstructures can be used to implement a static approximate membership query data\nstructure (AMQ) (i.e., a Bloom filter alternative) with false positive rate\n$2^{-r}$. The information-theoretic lower bound for both tasks is $r|S|$ bits.\nWhile succinct theoretical constructions using $(1+o(1))r|S|$ bits were known,\nthese could not achieve very small overheads in practice because they have an\nunfavorable space-time tradeoff hidden in the asymptotic costs or because small\noverheads would only be reached for physically impossible input sizes.

In multi-agent planning, the main challenge is to predict the actions\nof other agents, especially human drivers, as their intentions are hidden from\nother agents. Our algorithm uses game theory to develop a new auction, called\n\\model, that directly determines the optimal action for each agent based on\ntheir driving style (which is observable via commonly available sensors like\nlidars and cameras). GamePlan assigns a higher priority to more aggressive or\nimpatient drivers and a lower priority to more conservative or patient drivers;\nwe theoretically prove that such an approach, although counter-intuitive, is\ngame-theoretically optimal. Our approach successfully prevents collisions and\ndeadlocks. We compare our approach with prior state-of-the-art auction\ntechniques including economic auctions, time-based auctions (first-in\nfirst-out), and random bidding and show that each of these methods result in\ncollisions among agents when taking into account driver behavior.

To\nthis end, we first derive a novel upper bound to the prediction risk. We show\nthat imposing a mild assumption on the representation to be learned, namely\nmanifold restricted invertibility, is sufficient to deal with this issue.\nFurther, unlike existing approaches, our novel upper bound doesn't require the\nassumption of Lipschitzness of the loss function. In addition, the\ndistributional discrepancy in the representation space is handled via the\nWasserstein-2 barycenter cost. In this context, we creatively leverage old and\nrecent transport inequalities, which link various optimal transport metrics, in\nparticular the $L^1$ distance (also known as the total variation distance) and\nthe Wasserstein-2 distances, with the Kullback-Liebler divergence. These\nanalyses and insights motivate a new representation learning cost for DG that\nadditively balances three competing objectives: 1) minimizing classification\nerror across seen domains via cross-entropy, 2) enforcing domain-invariance in\nthe representation space via the Wasserstein-2 barycenter cost, and 3)\npromoting non-degenerate, nearly-invertible representation via one of two\nmechanisms, viz., an autoencoder-based reconstruction loss or a mutual\ninformation loss. It is to be noted that the proposed algorithms completely\nbypass the use of any adversarial training mechanism that is typical of many\ncurrent domain generalization approaches.

However, as noted by Pearl, interventional queries only form\npart of a larger hierarchy of causal queries, with counterfactuals sitting at\nthe top. Despite this, our community has not fully succeeded in adapting\nmachine learning tools to answer counterfactual queries. This work addresses\nthis challenge by showing how to implement twin network counterfactual\ninference -- an alternative to abduction, action, & prediction counterfactual\ninference -- with deep learning to estimate counterfactual queries.

Note, however, many\nrepresentative works on SNNs do not fully demonstrate the usefulness of their\ninherent recurrence (membrane potentials retaining information about the past)\nfor sequential learning. Most of the works train SNNs to recognize static\nimages by artificially expanded input representation in time through rate\ncoding. We show that SNNs can be trained for sequential tasks and propose\nmodifications to a network of LIF neurons that enable internal states to learn\nlong sequences and make their inherent recurrence resilient to the vanishing\ngradient problem.

    "title": "Modelling Arbitrary Complex Dielectric Properties -- an automated  implementation for gprMax",
    "abstract": "There is a need to accurately simulate materials with complex electromagnetic\nproperties when modelling Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR), as many objects\nencountered with GPR contain water, e.g. soils, curing concrete, and\nwater-filled pipes. One of widely-used open-source software that simulates\nelectromagnetic wave propagation is gprMax. It uses Yee's algorithm to solve\nMaxwell's equations with the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method. A\nsignificant drawback of the FDTD method is the limited ability to model\nmaterials with dispersive properties, currently narrowed to specific set of\nrelaxation mechanisms, namely multi-Debye, Drude and Lorentz media.\nConsequently, modelling any arbitrary complex material should be done by\napproximating it as a combination of these functions. This paper describes work\ncarried out as part of the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) programme 2021 to\ndevelop a new module within gprMax that can be used to simulate complex\ndispersive materials using multi-Debye expansions in an automatic manner. The\nmodule is capable of modelling Havriliak-Negami, Cole-Cole, Cole-Davidson,\nJonscher, Complex-Refractive Index Models, and indeed any arbitrary dispersive\nmaterial with real and imaginary permittivity specified by the user.",

    "abstract": "Vision-and-language (V\\&L) reasoning necessitates perception of visual\nconcepts such as objects and actions, understanding semantics and language\ngrounding, and reasoning about the interplay between the two modalities. One\ncrucial aspect of visual reasoning is spatial understanding, which involves\nunderstanding relative locations of objects, i.e.\\ implicitly learning the\ngeometry of the scene. In this work, we evaluate the faithfulness of V\\&L\nmodels to such geometric understanding, by formulating the prediction of\npair-wise relative locations of objects as a classification as well as a\nregression task. Our findings suggest that state-of-the-art transformer-based\nV\\&L models lack sufficient abilities to excel at this task. Motivated by this,\nwe design two objectives as proxies for 3D spatial reasoning (SR) -- object\ncentroid estimation, and relative position estimation, and train V\\&L with weak\nsupervision from off-the-shelf depth estimators. This leads to considerable\nimprovements in accuracy for the \"GQA\" visual question answering challenge (in\nfully supervised, few-shot, and O.O.D settings) as well as improvements in\nrelative spatial reasoning.

In elections, social media became\nan integral part of political campaigning to reach a greater audience and\ngather more support. The 2019 Lok Sabha election saw a massive spike in the\nusage of online social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp;\nwith every major political party launching its own organized social media\ncampaigns. In 2014, Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) took one step ahead in\norganizing the campaign by launching its app - NaMo App. We focus our research\non Twitter and NaMo App during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and CAA protests.\nTwitter is a platform where every individual can express their views and is not\nbiased. In contrast, NaMo App is one of the first apps centered around a\nspecific political party. It acted as a digital medium for BJP for organizing\nthe political campaign to make people's opinion in their favour. This research\naims to characterize the role of the NaMo App in a more traditional network as\nTwitter in shaping political discourse and studies the existence of an online\necho chamber. We began by analyzing the amount and type of content shared using\nthe NaMo App on Twitter. We performed content and network analysis for the\nexistence of the echo chamber. We also applied Hawkes process to see the\ninfluence that NaMo App has on Twitter. Through this research, we can conclude\nthat the users who share content using NaMo App, may be part of an online echo\nchamber and are likely to be BJP workers. We show the reach and influence that\nthe NaMo App has on Twitter is significantly less, indicating its inability to\nbreak through the diverse audience and change the narrative on Twitter.",

For question answering\n(QA), the current state-of-the-art pre-trained models typically need\nfine-tuning on tens of thousands of examples to obtain good results. Their\nperformance degrades significantly in a few-shot setting (< 100 examples). To\naddress this, we propose a simple fine-tuning framework that leverages\npre-trained text-to-text models and is directly aligned with their pre-training\nframework. Specifically, we construct the input as a concatenation of the\nquestion, a mask token representing the answer span and a context. Given this\ninput, the model is fine-tuned using the same objective as that of its\npre-training objective. Through experimental studies on various few-shot\nconfigurations, we show that this formulation leads to significant gains on\nmultiple QA benchmarks (an absolute gain of 34.2 F1 points on average when\nthere are only 16 training examples). The gains extend further when used with\nlarger models (Eg:- 72.3 F1 on SQuAD using BART-large with only 32 examples)\nand translate well to a multilingual setting . On the multilingual TydiQA\nbenchmark, our model outperforms the XLM-Roberta-large by an absolute margin of\nupto 40 F1 points and an average of 33 F1 points in a few-shot setting (<= 64\ntraining examples).

Specially, we introduce two\nalgorithms to find the proper counterfactuals in both discrete and continuous\nscenarios and then use the acquired counterfactuals to measure faithfulness.\nEmpirical results on several datasets show that compared with existing metrics,\nour proposed counterfactual evaluation method can achieve top correlation with\nthe ground truth under diffe",

    "abstract": "We develop a systemic risk framework to explore cascading systemic failures\nin networked control systems. A time-delayed version of the vehicle platooning\nproblem is used as a benchmark to study the interplay among network\nconnectivity, system dynamics, physical limitations, and uncertainty onto the\npossibility of cascading failure phenomena. The measure of value-at-risk is\nemployed to investigate the domino effect of failures among pairs of vehicles\nwithin the platoon. The systemic risk framework is suitably extended to\nquantify the robustness of cascading failures via a novel manipulation of\nbi-variate distribution. We establish closed-form risk formulas that explain\nthe effect of network parameters (e.g., Laplacian eigen-spectrum, time delay),\nnoise statistics, and systemic event sets onto the cascading failures. Our\nfindings can be applied to the design of robust platoons to lower the cascading\nrisk. We support our theoretical results with extensive simulations.",

    "abstract": "Due to the large bandwidth, low latency and computationally intensive\nfeatures of virtual reality (VR) video applications, the current\nresource-constrained wireless and edge networks cannot meet the requirements of\non-demand VR delivery. In this letter, we propose a joint horizontal and\nvertical collaboration architecture in mobile edge computing (MEC)-enabled\nsmall-cell networks for VR delivery. In the proposed architecture, multiple MEC\nservers can jointly provide VR head-mounted devices (HMDs) with edge caching\nand viewpoint computation services, while the computation tasks can also be\nperformed at HMDs or on the cloud. Power allocation at base stations (BSs) is\nconsidered in coordination with horizontal collaboration (HC) and vertical\ncollaboration (VC) of MEC servers to obtain lower end-to-end latency of VR\ndelivery. A joint caching, power allocation and task offloading problem is then\nformulated, and a discrete branch-reduce-and-bound (DBRB) algorithm inspired by\nmonotone optimization is proposed to effectively solve the problem. Simulation\nresults demonstrate the advantage of the proposed architecture and algorithm in\nterms of existing ones.",

    "abstract": "Using only a model that was trained to predict where people look at images,\nand no additional training data, we can produce a range of powerful editing\neffects for reducing distraction in images. Given an image and a mask\nspecifying the region to edit, we backpropagate through a state-of-the-art\nsaliency model to parameterize a differentiable editing operator, such that the\nsaliency within the masked region is reduced. We demonstrate several operators,\nincluding: a recoloring operator, which learns to apply a color transform that\ncamouflages and blends distractors into their surroundings; a warping operator,\nwhich warps less salient image regions to cover distractors, gradually\ncollapsing objects into themselves and effectively removing them (an effect\nakin to inpainting); a GAN operator, which uses a semantic prior to fully\nreplace image regions with plausible, less salient alternatives. The resulting\neffects are consistent with cognitive research on the human visual system\n(e.g., since color mismatch is salient, the recoloring operator learns to\nharmonize objects' colors with their surrounding to reduce their saliency),\nand, importantly, are all achieved solely through the guidance of the\npretrained saliency model, with no additional supervision.

    "abstract": "We consider adversarial attacks to a black-box model when no queries are\nallowed. In this setting, many methods directly attack surrogate models and\ntransfer the obtained adversarial examples to fool the target model. Plenty of\nprevious works investigated what kind of attacks to the surrogate model can\ngenerate more transferable adversarial examples, but their performances are\nstill limited due to the mismatches between surrogate models and the target\nmodel. In this paper, we tackle this problem from a novel angle -- instead of\nusing the original surrogate models, can we obtain a Meta-Surrogate Model (MSM)\nsuch that attacks to this model can be easier transferred to other models? We\nshow that this goal can be mathematically formulated as a well-posed\n(bi-level-like) optimization problem and design a differentiable attacker to\nmake training feasible. Given one or a set of surrogate models, our method can\nthus obtain an MSM such that adversarial examples generated on MSM enjoy\neximious transferability. Comprehensive experiments on Cifar-10 and ImageNet\ndemonstrate that by attacking the MSM, we can obtain stronger transferable\nadversarial examples to fool black-box models including adversarially trained\nones, with much higher success rates than existing methods. The proposed method\nreveals significant security challenges of deep models and is promising to be\nserved as a state-of-the-art benchmark for evaluating the robustness of deep\nmodels in the black-box setting.",

An online domain adaptation\ntechnique under multisource streaming processes, namely automatic online\nmulti-source domain adaptation (AOMSDA), is proposed in this paper. The online\ndomain adaptation strategy of AOMSDA is formulated under a coupled generative\nand discriminative approach of denoising autoencoder (DAE) where the central\nmoment discrepancy (CMD)-based regularizer is integrated to handle the\nexistence of multi-source domains thereby taking advantage of complementary\ninformation sources. The asynchronous concept drifts taking place at different\ntime periods are addressed by a self-organizing structure and a node\nre-weighting strategy. Our numerical study demonstrates that AOMSDA is capable\nof outperforming its counterparts in 5 of 8 study cases while the ablation\nstudy depicts the advantage of each learning component. In addition, AOMSDA is\ngeneral for any number of source streams. The source code of AOMSDA is shared\npublicly in https://github.com/Renchunzi-Xie/AOMSDA.git.",

We collect 16,855 scientific papers from six top\njournals in the field of machine learning published from 1997 to 2016 and\nanalyze them using ATM. The dataset is broken down into 4 intervals to identify\nthe top researchers and find similar researchers using their similarity score.\nThe similarity score is calculated using Hellinger distance. The researchers\nare plotted using t-SNE, which reduces the dimensionality of the data while\nkeeping the same distance between the points.

    "abstract": "In deep neural networks, better results can often be obtained by increasing\nthe complexity of previously developed basic models. However, it is unclear\nwhether there is a way to boost performance by decreasing the complexity of\nsuch models. Here, based on an optimization method, we investigate the\nfeasibility of improving graph classification performance while simplifying the\nmodel learning process. Inspired by progress in structural information\nassessment, we optimize the given data sample from graphs to encoding trees. In\nparticular, we minimize the structural entropy of the transformed encoding tree\nto decode the key structure underlying a graph. This transformation is denoted\nas structural optimization. Furthermore, we propose a novel feature combination\nscheme, termed hierarchical reporting, for encoding trees. In this scheme,\nfeatures are transferred from leaf nodes to root nodes by following the\nhierarchical structures of encoding trees. We then present an implementation of\nthe scheme in a tree kernel and a convolutional network to perform graph\nclassification. The tree kernel follows label propagation in the\nWeisfeiler-Lehman (WL) subtree kernel, but it has a lower runtime complexity\n$O(n)$. The convolutional network is a special implementation of our tree\nkernel in the deep learning field and is called Encoding Tree Learning (ETL).\nWe empirically validate our tree kernel and convolutional network with several\ngraph classification benchmarks and demonstrate that our methods achieve better\nperformance and lower computational consumption than competing approaches.",

    "abstract": "The recent progress in multi-agent deep reinforcement learning(MADRL) makes\nit more practical in real-world tasks, but its relatively poor scalability and\nthe partially observable constraints raise challenges to its performance and\ndeployment. Based on our intuitive observation that the human society could be\nregarded as a large-scale partially observable environment, where each\nindividual has the function of communicating with neighbors and remembering its\nown experience, we propose a novel network structure called hierarchical graph\nrecurrent network(HGRN) for multi-agent cooperation under partial\nobservability. Specifically, we construct the multi-agent system as a graph,\nuse the hierarchical graph attention network(HGAT) to achieve communication\nbetween neighboring agents, and exploit GRU to enable agents to record\nhistorical information. To encourage exploration and improve robustness, we\ndesign a maximum-entropy learning method to learn stochastic policies of a\nconfigurable target action entropy. Based on the above technologies, we\nproposed a value-based MADRL algorithm called Soft-HGRN and its actor-critic\nvariant named SAC-HRGN. Experimental results based on three homogeneous tasks\nand one heterogeneous environment not only show that our approach achieves\nclear improvements compared with four baselines, but also demonstrates the\ninterpretability, scalability, and transferability of the proposed model.\nAblation studies prove the function and necessity of each component.",

However,\nexisting works focus on OoD algorithms, such as invariant risk minimization,\ndomain generalization, or stable learning, without considering the influence of\ndeep model architectures on OoD generalization, which may lead to sub-optimal\nperformance. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods search for architecture\nbased on its performance on the training data, which may result in poor\ngeneralization for OoD tasks. In this work, we propose robust Neural\nArchitecture Search for OoD generalization (NAS-OoD), which optimizes the\narchitecture with respect to its performance on generated OoD data by gradient\ndescent. Specifically, a data generator is learned to synthesize OoD data by\nmaximizing losses computed by different neural architectures, while the goal\nfor architecture search is to find the optimal architecture parameters that\nminimize the synthetic OoD data losses. The data generator and the neural\narchitecture are jointly optimized in an end-to-end manner, and the minimax\ntraining process effectively discovers robust architectures that generalize\nwell for different distribution shifts. Extensive experimental results show\nthat NAS-OoD achieves superior performance on various OoD generalization\nbenchmarks with deep models having a much fewer number of parameters. In\naddition, on a real industry dataset, the proposed NAS-OoD method reduces the\nerror rate by more than 70% compared with the state-of-the-art method,\ndemonstrating the proposed method's practicality for real applications.",

    "abstract": "To alleviate data sparsity and cold-start problems of traditional recommender\nsystems (RSs), incorporating knowledge graphs (KGs) to supplement auxiliary\ninformation has attracted considerable attention recently. However, simply\nintegrating KGs in current KG-based RS models is not necessarily a guarantee to\nimprove the recommendation performance, which may even weaken the holistic\nmodel capability. This is because the construction of these KGs is independent\nof the collection of historical user-item interactions; hence, information in\nthese KGs may not always be helpful for recommendation to all users.\nIn this paper, we propose attentive Knowledge-aware Graph convolutional\nnetworks with Collaborative Guidance for personalized Recommendation (CG-KGR).\nCG-KGR is a novel knowledge-aware recommendation model that enables ample and\ncoherent learning of KGs and user-item interactions, via our proposed\nCollaborative Guidance Mechanism. Specifically, CG-KGR first encapsulates\nhistorical interactions to interactive information summarization. Then CG-KGR\nutilizes it as guidance to extract information out of KGs, which eventually\nprovides more precise personalized recommendation. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on four real-world datasets over two recommendation tasks, i.e.,\nTop-K recommendation and Click-Through rate (CTR) prediction. The experimental\nresults show that the CG-KGR model significantly outperforms recent\nstate-of-the-art models by 4.0-53.2% and 0.4-3.2%, in terms of Recall metric on\nTop-K recommendation and AUC on CTR prediction, respectively.",

Recently, it has been\nstudied on the heterogeneous graph, which contains multiple types of nodes and\nedges, posing great challenges for modeling the high-order relationship between\nnodes. With the surge of graph embedding mechanism, it has also been adopted to\ncommunity detection. A remarkable group of works use the meta-path to capture\nthe high-order relationship between nodes and embed them into nodes' embedding\nto facilitate community detection. However, defining meaningful meta-paths\nrequires much domain knowledge, which largely limits their applications,\nespecially on schema-rich heterogeneous graphs like knowledge graphs. To\nalleviate this issue, in this paper, we propose to exploit the context path to\ncapture the high-order relationship between nodes, and build a Context\nPath-based Graph Neural Network (CP-GNN) model. It recursively embeds the\nhigh-order relationship between nodes into the node embedding with attention\nmechanisms to discriminate the importance of different relationships. By\nmaximizing the expectation of the co-occurrence of nodes connected by context\npaths, the model can learn the nodes' embeddings that both well preserve the\nhigh-order relationship between nodes and are helpful for community detection.\nExtensive experimental results on four real-world datasets show that CP-GNN\noutperforms the state-of-the-art community detection methods.",

However, there are many ways to express\nsuch conditionals in natural language and also many ways how they can be\ninterpreted. We hypothesize that conditional statements in requirements are a\nsource of ambiguity, potentially affecting downstream activities such as test\ncase generation negatively. Objective: Our goal is to understand how specific\nconditionals are interpreted by readers who work with requirements. Method: We\nconduct a descriptive survey with 104 RE practitioners and ask how they\ninterpret 12 different conditional clauses. We map their interpretations to\nlogical formulas written in Propositional (Temporal) Logic and discuss the\nimplications. Results: The conditionals in our tested requirements were\ninterpreted ambiguously. We found that practitioners disagree on whether an\nantecedent is only sufficient or also necessary for the consequent.\nInterestingly, the disagreement persists even when the system behavior is known\nto the practitioners. We also found that certain cue phrases are associated\nwith specific interpretations. Conclusion: Conditionals in requirements are a\nsource of ambiguity and there is not just one way to interpret them formally.\nThis affects any analysis that builds upon formalized requirements (e.g.,\ninconsistency checking, test-case generation).

    "title": "Hierarchical Object-to-Zone Graph for Object Navigation",
    "abstract": "The goal of object navigation is to reach the expected objects according to\nvisual information in the unseen environments. Previous works usually implement\ndeep models to train an agent to predict actions in real-time. However, in the\nunseen environment, when the target object is not in egocentric view, the agent\nmay not be able to make wise decisions due to the lack of guidance. In this\npaper, we propose a hierarchical object-to-zone (HOZ) graph to guide the agent\nin a coarse-to-fine manner, and an online-learning mechanism is also proposed\nto update HOZ according to the real-time observation in new environments. In\nparticular, the HOZ graph is composed of scene nodes, zone nodes and object\nnodes. With the pre-learned HOZ graph, the real-time observation and the target\ngoal, the agent can constantly plan an optimal path from zone to zone. In the\nestimated path, the next potential zone is regarded as sub-goal, which is also\nfed into the deep reinforcement learning model for action prediction. Our\nmethods are evaluated on the AI2-Thor simulator. In addition to widely used\nevaluation metrics SR and SPL, we also propose a new evaluation metric of SAE\nthat focuses on the effective action rate. Experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.",

    "abstract": "Rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence have shifted the focus from\ntraditional human-directed robots to fully autonomous ones that do not require\nexplicit human control. These are commonly referred to as Human-on-the-Loop\n(HotL) systems. Transparency of HotL systems necessitates clear explanations of\nautonomous behavior so that humans are aware of what is happening in the\nenvironment and can understand why robots behave in a certain way. However, in\ncomplex multi-robot environments, especially those in which the robots are\nautonomous, mobile, and require intermittent interventions, humans may struggle\nto maintain situational awareness. Presenting humans with rich explanations of\nautonomous behavior tends to overload them with too much information and\nnegatively affect their understanding of the situation. Therefore, explaining\nthe autonomous behavior or autonomy of multiple robots creates a design tension\nthat demands careful investigation. This paper examines the User Interface (UI)\ndesign trade-offs associated with providing timely and detailed explanations of\nautonomous behavior for swarms of small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS) or\ndrones. We analyze the impact of UI design choices on human awareness of the\nsituation.

Nowadays, many convolutional\nneural networks have been proposed for the hyperspectral image super-resolution\nproblem.

In this case, the observation\nweighting matrices (inverse error covariance matrices) used in the assimilation\nmay be full matrices rather than diagonal. Thus, the computation of\nmatrix-vector products in the variational minimization problem may be very\ntime-consuming, particularly if the parallel computation of the matrix-vector\nproduct requires a high degree of communication between processing elements.\nHence, we introduce a well-known numerical approximation method, called the\nfast multipole method (FMM), to speed up the matrix-vector multiplications in\ndata assimilation. We explore a particular type of FMM that uses a singular\nvalue decomposition (SVD-FMM) and adjust it to suit our new application in data\nassimilation. By approximating a large part of the computation of the\nmatrix-vector product, the SVD-FMM technique greatly reduces the computational\ncomplexity compared with the standard approach. We develop a novel possible\nparallelization scheme of the SVD-FMM for our application, which can reduce the\ncommunication costs. We investigate the accuracy of the SVD-FMM technique in\nseveral numerical experiments: we first assess the accuracy using covariance\nmatrices that are created using different correlation functions and\nlengthscales; then investigate the impact of reconditioning the covariance\nmatrices on the accuracy; and finally examine the feasibility of the technique\nin the presence of missing observations.

Although recent studies have successfully discretized a full-precision\nnetwork, they still incur large quantization errors after training, thus giving\nrise to a significant performance gap between a full-precision network and its\nquantized counterpart. In this work, we propose a novel quantization method for\nneural networks, Cluster-Promoting Quantization (CPQ) that finds the optimal\nquantization grids while naturally encouraging the underlying full-precision\nweights to gather around those quantization grids cohesively during training.\nThis property of CPQ is thanks to our two main ingredients that enable\ndifferentiable quantization: i) the use of the categorical distribution\ndesigned by a specific probabilistic parametrization in the forward pass and\nii) our proposed multi-class straight-through estimator (STE) in the backward\npass. Since our second component, multi-class STE, is intrinsically biased, we\nadditionally propose a new bit-drop technique, DropBits, that revises the\nstandard dropout regularization to randomly drop bits instead of neurons. As a\nnatural extension of DropBits, we further introduce the way of learning\nheterogeneous quantization levels to find proper bit-length for each layer by\nimposing an additional regularization on DropBits. We experimentally validate\nour method on various benchmark datasets and network architectures, and also\nsupport a new hypothesis for quantization: learning heterogeneous quantization\nlevels outperforms the case using the same but fixed quantization levels from\nscratch.",

    "abstract": "Assist-as-needed (AAN) control aims at promoting therapeutic outcomes in\nrobot-assisted rehabilitation by encouraging patients' active participation.\nImpedance control is used by most AAN controllers to create a compliant force\nfield around a target motion to ensure tracking accuracy while allowing\nmoderate kinematic errors. However, since the parameters governing the shape of\nthe force field are often tuned manually or adapted online based on simplistic\nassumptions about subjects' learning abilities, the effectiveness of\nconventional AAN controllers may be limited. In this work, we propose a novel\nadaptive AAN controller that is capable of autonomously reshaping the force\nfield in a phase-dependent manner according to each individual's motor\nabilities and task requirements. The proposed controller consists of a modified\nPolicy Improvement with Path Integral algorithm, a model-free, sampling-based\nreinforcement learning method that learns a subject-specific impedance\nlandscape in real-time, and a hierarchical policy parameter evaluation\nstructure that embeds the AAN paradigm by specifying performance-driven\nlearning goals. The adaptability of the proposed control strategy to subjects'\nmotor responses and its ability to promote short-term motor adaptations are\nexperimentally validated through treadmill training sessions with able-bodied\nsubjects who learned altered gait patterns with the assistance of a powered\nankle-foot orthosis.",

We give a randomized algorithm that can output a spanning forest of a\nweighted graph with constant probability after $O(\\log^4(n))$ matrix-vector\nmultiplication queries to the adjacency matrix.

Many splitting algorithms have been designed for\nefficient temporal discretization. In this paper, our goal is to use temporal\nsplitting concepts in designing machine learning algorithms and, at the same\ntime, help splitting algorithms by incorporating data and speeding them up.\nSince the spitting solution usually has an explicit and implicit part, we will\ncall our method hybrid explicit-implict (HEI) learning. We will consider a\nrecently introduced multiscale splitting algorithms. To approximate the\ndynamics, only a few degrees of freedom are solved implicitly, while others\nexplicitly. In this paper, we use this splitting concept in machine learning\nand propose several strategies. First, the implicit part of the solution can be\nlearned as it is more difficult to solve, while the explicit part can be\ncomputed. This provides a speed-up and data incorporation for splitting\napproaches. Secondly, one can design a hybrid neural network architecture\nbecause handling explicit parts requires much fewer communications among\nneurons and can be done efficiently. Thirdly, one can solve the coarse grid\ncomponent via PDEs or other approximation methods and construct simpler neural\nnetworks for the explicit part of the solutions. We discuss these options and\nimplement one of them by interpreting it as a machine translation task. This\ninterpretation successfully enables us using the Transformer since it can\nperform model reduction for multiple time series and learn the connection. We\nalso find that the splitting scheme is a great platform to predict the coarse\nsolution with insufficient information of the target model: the target problem\nis partially given and we need to solve it through a known problem.

    "abstract": "As the High Performance Computing world moves towards the Exa-Scale era, huge\namounts of data should be analyzed, manipulated and stored. In the traditional\nstorage/memory hierarchy, each compute node retains its data objects in its\nlocal volatile DRAM. Whenever the DRAM's capacity becomes insufficient for\nstoring this data, the computation should either be distributed between several\ncompute nodes, or some portion of these data objects must be stored in a\nnon-volatile block device such as a hard disk drive or an SSD storage device.\nOptane DataCenter Persistent Memory Module (DCPMM), a new technology introduced\nby Intel, provides non-volatile memory that can be plugged into standard memory\nbus slots and therefore be accessed much faster than standard storage devices.\nIn this work, we present and analyze the results of a comprehensive performance\nassessment of several ways in which DCPMM can 1) replace standard storage\ndevices, and 2) replace or augment DRAM for improving the performance of HPC\nscientific computations. To achieve this goal, we have configured an HPC system\nsuch that DCPMM can service I/O operations of scientific applications, replace\nstandard storage devices and file systems (specifically for diagnostics and\ncheckpoint-restarting), and serve for expanding applications' main memory. We\nfocus on keeping the scientific codes with as few changes as possible, while\nallowing them to access the NVM transparently as if they access persistent\nstorage. Our results show that DCPMM allows scientific applications to fully\nutilize nodes' locality by providing them with sufficiently-large main memory.\nMoreover, it can be used for providing a high-performance replacement for\npersistent storage. Thus, the usage of DCPMM has the potential of replacing\nstandard HDD and SSD storage devices in HPC architectures and enabling a more\nefficient platform for modern supercomputing applications.",

    "abstract": "GAN-based techniques that generate and synthesize realistic faces have caused\nsevere social concerns and security problems. Existing methods for detecting\nGAN-generated faces can perform well on limited public datasets. However,\nimages from existing public datasets do not represent real-world scenarios well\nenough in terms of view variations and data distributions (where real faces\nlargely outnumber synthetic faces). The state-of-the-art methods do not\ngeneralize well in real-world problems and lack the interpretability of\ndetection results. Performance of existing GAN-face detection models degrades\nsignificantly when facing imbalanced data distributions. To address these\nshortcomings, we propose a robust, attentive, end-to-end network that can spot\nGAN-generated faces by analyzing their eye inconsistencies. Specifically, our\nmodel learns to identify inconsistent eye components by localizing and\ncomparing the iris artifacts between the two eyes automatically. Our deep\nnetwork addresses the imbalance learning issues by considering the AUC loss and\nthe traditional cross-entropy loss jointly. Comprehensive evaluations of the\nFFHQ dataset in terms of both balanced and imbalanced scenarios demonstrate the\nsuperiority of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles must reason about spatial occlusions in urban\nenvironments to ensure safety without being overly cautious. Prior work\nexplored occlusion inference from observed social behaviors of road agents.\nInferring occupancy from agent behaviors is an inherently multimodal problem; a\ndriver may behave in the same manner for different occupancy patterns ahead of\nthem (e.g., a driver may move at constant speed in traffic or on an open road).\nPast work, however, does not account for this multimodality, thus neglecting to\nmodel this source of aleatoric uncertainty in the relationship between driver\nbehaviors and their environment. We propose an occlusion inference method that\ncharacterizes observed behaviors of human agents as sensor measurements, and\nfuses them with those from a standard sensor suite. To capture the aleatoric\nuncertainty, we train a conditional variational autoencoder with a discrete\nlatent space to learn a multimodal mapping from observed driver trajectories to\nan occupancy grid representation of the view ahead of the driver. Our method\nhandles multi-agent scenarios, combining measurements from multiple observed\ndrivers using evidential theory to solve the sensor fusion problem. Our\napproach is validated on a real-world dataset, outperforming baselines and\ndemonstrating real-time capable performance.

    "abstract": "In this paper we propose a novel square root sliding-window bundle adjustment\nsuitable for real-time odometry applications. The square root formulation\npervades three major aspects of our optimization-based sliding-window\nestimator: for bundle adjustment we eliminate landmark variables with nullspace\nprojection; to store the marginalization prior we employ a matrix square root\nof the Hessian; and when marginalizing old poses we avoid forming normal\nequations and update the square root prior directly with a specialized QR\ndecomposition. We show that the proposed square root marginalization is\nalgebraically equivalent to the conventional use of Schur complement (SC) on\nthe Hessian. Moreover, it elegantly deals with rank-deficient Jacobians\nproducing a prior equivalent to SC with Moore-Penrose inverse. Our evaluation\nof visual and visual-inertial odometry on real-world datasets demonstrates that\nthe proposed estimator is 36% faster than the baseline. It furthermore shows\nthat in single precision, conventional Hessian-based marginalization leads to\nnumeric failures and reduced accuracy. We analyse numeric properties of the\nmarginalization prior to explain why our square root form does not suffer from\nthe same effect and therefore entails superior performance.",

First, if $d$ represents the doubling\ndimension of the metric space, we show that the distortion of STV is $O(d \\log\n\\log m)$, where $m$ represents the number of candidates. For doubling metrics\nthis implies an exponential improvement over the lower bound for general\nmetrics, and as a special case it effectively answers a question left open by\nSkowron and Elkind (AAAI '17) regarding the distortion of STV under\nlow-dimensional Euclidean spaces. More broadly, this constitutes the first\nnexus between the performance of any voting rule and the \"intrinsic\ndimensionality\" of the underlying metric space. We also establish a\nnearly-matching lower bound, refining the construction of Skowron and Elkind.\nMoreover, motivated by the efficiency of STV, we investigate whether natural\nlearning rules can lead to low-distortion outcomes. Specifically, we introduce\nsimple, deterministic and decentralized exploration/exploitation dynamics, and\nwe show that they converge to a candidate with $O(1)$ distortion. Finally,\ndriven by applications in facility location games, we consider several\nrefinements and extensions of the standard metric-setting. Namely, we prove\nthat the deterministic mechanism recently introduced by Gkatzelis, Halpern, and\nShah (FOCS '20) attains the optimal distortion bound of $2$ under\nultra-metrics, while it also comes close to our lower bound under distances\nsatisfying approximate triangle inequalities.",

    "abstract": "Emerging real-time applications such as those classified under ultra-reliable\nlow latency (uRLLC) generate bursty traffic and have strict Quality of Service\n(QoS) requirements. Passive Optical Network (PON) is a popular access network\ntechnology, which is envisioned to handle such applications at the access\nsegment of the network. However, the existing standards cannot handle strict\nQoS constraints. The available solutions rely on instantaneous heuristic\ndecisions and maintain QoS constraints (mostly bandwidth) in an average sense.\nExisting works with optimal strategies are computationally complex and are not\nsuitable for uRLLC applications. This paper presents a novel\ncomputationally-efficient, far-sighted bandwidth allocation policy design for\nfacilitating bursty traffic in a PON framework while satisfying strict QoS (age\nof information/delay and bandwidth) requirements of modern applications. To\nthis purpose, first we design a delay-tracking mechanism which allows us to\nmodel the resource allocation problem from a control-theoretic viewpoint as a\nModel Predictive Control (MPC). MPC helps in taking far-sighted decisions\nregarding resource allocations and captures the time-varying dynamics of the\nnetwork. We provide computationally efficient polynomial-time solutions and\nshow its implementation in the PON framework.

We aim at a\nconversation strategy for the robot by reinforcement learning to stimulate the\nPwD to talk. Specifically, to characterize the stochastic reactions of a PwD to\nthe robot's actions, a simulation model of a PwD is developed which features\nthe transition probabilities among different PwD states consisting of the\nresponse relevance, emotion levels and confusion conditions. A Q-learning (QL)\nalgorithm is then designed to achieve the best conversation strategy for the\nrobot. The objective is to stimulate the PwD to talk as much as possible while\nkeeping the PwD's states as positive as possible. In certain conditions, the\nachieved strategy gives the PwD choices to continue or change the topic, or\nstop the conversation, so that the PwD has a sense of control to mitigate the\nconversation stress. To achieve this, the standard QL algorithm is revised to\ndeliberately integrate the impact of PwD's choices into the Q-value updates.\nFinally, the simulation results demonstrate the learning convergence and\nvalidate the efficacy of the achieved strategy. Tests show that the strategy is\ncapable to duly adjust the difficulty level of prompt according to the PwD's\nstates, take actions (e.g., repeat or explain the prompt, or comfort) to help\nthe PwD out of bad states, and allow the PwD to control the conversation\ntendency when bad states continue.",

    "abstract": "In combinatorial reconfiguration, the reconfiguration problems on a vertex\nsubset (e.g., an independent set) are well investigated. In these problems,\nsome tokens are placed on a subset of vertices of the graph, and there are\nthree natural reconfiguration rules called ``token sliding,'' ``token\njumping,'' and ``token addition and removal''. In the context of computational\ncomplexity of puzzles, the sliding block puzzles play an important role.\nDepending on the rules and set of pieces, the sliding block puzzles\ncharacterize the computational complexity classes including P, NP, and PSPACE.\nThe sliding block puzzles correspond to the token sliding model in the context\nof combinatorial reconfiguration. On the other hand, a relatively new notion of\njumping block puzzles is proposed in puzzle society. This is the counterpart to\nthe token jumping model of the combinatorial reconfiguration problems in the\ncontext of block puzzles. We investigate several variants of jumping block\npuzzles and determine their computational complexities.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we focus on landscape animation, which aims to generate\ntime-lapse videos from a single landscape image. Motion is crucial for\nlandscape animation as it determines how objects move in videos. Existing\nmethods are able to generate appealing videos by learning motion from real\ntime-lapse videos. However, current methods suffer from inaccurate motion\ngeneration, which leads to unrealistic video results. To tackle this problem,\nwe propose a model named FGLA to generate high-quality and realistic videos by\nlearning Fine-Grained motion embedding for Landscape Animation. Our model\nconsists of two parts: (1) a motion encoder which embeds time-lapse motion in a\nfine-grained way. (2) a motion generator which generates realistic motion to\nanimate input images. To train and evaluate on diverse time-lapse videos, we\nbuild the largest high-resolution Time-lapse video dataset with Diverse scenes,\nnamely Time-lapse-D, which includes 16,874 video clips with over 10 million\nframes. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our method. In particular, our method achieves relative\nimprovements by 19% on LIPIS and 5.6% on FVD compared with state-of-the-art\nmethods on our dataset. A user study carried out with 700 human subjects shows\nthat our approach visually outperforms existing methods by a large margin.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the problem of facial kinship verification by\nlearning hierarchical reasoning graph networks. Conventional methods usually\nfocus on learning discriminative features for each facial image of a paired\nsample and neglect how to fuse the obtained two facial image features and\nreason about the relations between them. To address this, we propose a\nStar-shaped Reasoning Graph Network (S-RGN). Our S-RGN first constructs a\nstar-shaped graph where each surrounding node encodes the information of\ncomparisons in a feature dimension and the central node is employed as the\nbridge for the interaction of surrounding nodes. Then we perform relational\nreasoning on this star graph with iterative message passing. The proposed S-RGN\nuses only one central node to analyze and process information from all\nsurrounding nodes, which limits its reasoning capacity. We further develop a\nHierarchical Reasoning Graph Network (H-RGN) to exploit more powerful and\nflexible capacity. More specifically, our H-RGN introduces a set of latent\nreasoning nodes and constructs a hierarchical graph with them. Then bottom-up\ncomparative information abstraction and top-down comprehensive signal\npropagation are iteratively performed on the hierarchical graph to update the\nnode features. Extensive experimental results on four widely used kinship\ndatabases show that the proposed methods achieve very competitive results.",

    "abstract": "Model compression techniques are recently gaining explosive attention for\nobtaining efficient AI models for various real-time applications. Channel\npruning is one important compression strategy and is widely used in slimming\nvarious DNNs. Previous gate-based or importance-based pruning methods aim to\nremove channels whose importance is smallest. However, it remains unclear what\ncriteria the channel importance should be measured on, leading to various\nchannel selection heuristics. Some other sampling-based pruning methods deploy\nsampling strategies to train sub-nets, which often causes the training\ninstability and the compressed model's degraded performance. In view of the\nresearch gaps, we present a new module named Gates with Differentiable\nPolarization (GDP), inspired by principled optimization ideas. GDP can be\nplugged before convolutional layers without bells and whistles, to control the\non-and-off of each channel or whole layer block. During the training process,\nthe polarization effect will drive a subset of gates to smoothly decrease to\nexact zero, while other gates gradually stay away from zero by a large margin.\nWhen training terminates, those zero-gated channels can be painlessly removed,\nwhile other non-zero gates can be absorbed into the succeeding convolution\nkernel, causing completely no interruption to training nor damage to the\ntrained model. Experiments conducted over CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets show\nthat the proposed GDP algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art performance on\nvarious benchmark DNNs at a broad range of pruning ratios. We also apply GDP to\nDeepLabV3Plus-ResNet50 on the challenging Pascal VOC segmentation task, whose\ntest performance sees no drop (even slightly improved) with over 60% FLOPs\nsaving.",

Notably, for adversarial textual attack, it is even better\nthan the previous bound which only holds in special case. Extensive experiments\ninvolving five NLP tasks, six datasets and eleven NLP models show that LS can\nlargely reduce the number of queries usually by an order of magnitude to\nachieve high attack success rates.

They leverage predefined heuristic static\nanalysis rules to scan source code or binary code of a software project, and\nreport violations to these rules as warnings to be verified. However, the\nadvantages of static bug finders are overshadowed by such issues as uncovered\nobvious bugs, false positives, etc. To improve these tools, many techniques\nhave been proposed to filter out false positives reported or design new static\nanalysis rules. Nevertheless, the under-performance of bug finders can also be\ncaused by the incorrectness of current rules contained in the static bug\nfinders, which is not explored yet. In this work, we propose a differential\ntesting approach to detect bugs in the rules of four widely-used static bug\nfinders, i.e., SonarQube, PMD, SpotBugs, and ErrorProne, and conduct a\nqualitative study about the bugs found. To retrieve paired rules across static\nbug finders for differential testing, we design a heuristic-based rule mapping\nmethod which combines the similarity in rules description and the overlap in\nwarning information reported by the tools. The experiment on 2,728 open source\nprojects reveals 46 bugs in the static bug finders, among which 24 are fixed or\nconfirmed and the left are awaiting confirmation. We also summarize 13 bug\npatterns in the static analysis rules based on their context and root causes,\nwhich can serve as the checklist for designing and implementing other rules and\nor in other tools. This study indicates that the commonly-used static bug\nfinders are not as reliable as they might have been envisaged.

To ascertain the soundness of our framework, the\nreproducibility assessment embraces variations of different factors such as\ntraining strategies and data perturbations. Despite these challenges, our\nframework successfully yielded replicable conclusions across different training\nstrategies and various clinical datasets. Our findings could thus pave the way\nfor the development of biomarker trustworthiness and reliability assessment\nmethods for computer-aided diagnosis and prognosis tasks.

    "abstract": "Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) offers several advantages including minimum\ntissue injury and blood loss, and quick recovery time, however, it imposes some\nlimitations on surgeons ability. Among others such as lack of tactile or haptic\nfeedback, poor visualization of the surgical site is one of the most\nacknowledged factors that exhibits several surgical drawbacks including\nunintentional tissue damage. To the context of robot assisted surgery, lack of\nframe contextual details makes vision task challenging when it comes to\ntracking tissue and tools, segmenting scene, and estimating pose and depth. In\nMIS the acquired frames are compromised by different noises and get blurred\ncaused by motions from different sources. Moreover, when underwater environment\nis considered for instance knee arthroscopy, mostly visible noises and blur\neffects are originated from the environment, poor control on illuminations and\nimaging conditions. Additionally, in MIS, procedure like automatic white\nbalancing and transformation between the raw color information to its standard\nRGB color space are often absent due to the hardware miniaturization. There is\na high demand of an online preprocessing framework that can circumvent these\ndrawbacks. Our proposed method is able to restore a latent clean and sharp\nimage in standard RGB color space from its noisy, blur and raw observation in a\nsingle preprocessing stage.",

Extracting and then normalising\nPopulation, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) information from\nclinical trial articles may be an effective way to automatically assign trials\nto systematic reviews and avoid searching and screening - the two most\ntime-consuming systematic review processes. We propose and test a novel\napproach to PICO span detection. The major difference between our proposed\nmethod and previous approaches comes from detecting spans without needing\nannotated span data and using only crowdsourced sentence-level annotations.\nExperiments on two datasets show that PICO span detection results achieve much\nhigher results for recall when compared to fully supervised methods with PICO\nsentence detection at least as good as human annotations. By removing the\nreliance on expert annotations for span detection, this work could be used in\nhuman-machine pipeline for turning low-quality crowdsourced, and sentence-level\nPICO annotations into structured information that can be used to quickly assign\ntrials to relevant systematic reviews.",

    "abstract": "Users of social networks tend to post and share content with little\nrestraint. Hence, rumors and fake news can quickly spread on a huge scale. This\nmay pose a threat to the credibility of social media and can cause serious\nconsequences in real life. Therefore, the task of rumor detection and\nverification has become extremely important. Assessing the veracity of a social\nmedia message (e.g., by fact checkers) involves analyzing the text of the\nmessage, its context and any multimedia attachment. This is a very\ntime-consuming task that can be much helped by machine learning. In the\nliterature, most message veracity verification methods only exploit textual\ncontents and metadata. Very few take both textual and visual contents, and more\nparticularly images, into account. In this paper, we second the hypothesis that\nexploiting all of the components of a social media post enhances the accuracy\nof veracity detection. To further the state of the art, we first propose using\na set of advanced image features that are inspired from the field of image\nquality assessment, which effectively contributes to rumor detection. These\nmetrics are good indicators for the detection of fake images, even for those\ngenerated by advanced techniques like generative adversarial networks (GANs).\nThen, we introduce the Multimodal fusiON framework to assess message veracIty\nin social neTwORks (MONITOR), which exploits all message features (i.e., text,\nsocial context, and image features) by supervised machine learning. Such\nalgorithms provide interpretability and explainability in the decisions taken,\nwhich we believe is particularly important in the context of rumor\nverification. Experimental results show that MONITOR can detect rumors with an\naccuracy of 96% and 89% on the MediaEval benchmark and the FakeNewsNet dataset,\nrespectively. These results are significantly better than those of\nstate-of-the-art machine learning baselines.",

However, current direct control methods are\nimpractical, and existing tools for programming robot remotely have focused on\nusers with significant robotic experience. Extending robot remote programming\nto end users, i.e., users who are experts in a domain but novices in robotics,\nrequires tools that balance the rich features necessary for complex\nteleoperation tasks with ease of use. The primary challenge to usability is\nthat novice users are unable to specify complete and robust task plans to allow\na robot to perform duties autonomously, particularly in highly variable\nenvironments. Our solution is to allow operators to specify shorter sequences\nof high-level commands, which we call task-level authoring, to create periods\nof variable robot autonomy. This approach allows inexperienced users to create\nrobot behaviors in uncertain environments by interleaving exploration,\nspecification of behaviors, and execution as separate steps. End users are able\nto break down the specification of tasks and adapt to the current needs of the\ninteraction and environments, combining the reactivity of direct control to\nasynchronous operation. In this paper, we describe a prototype system\ncontextualized in light manufacturing and its empirical validation in a user\nstudy where 18 participants with some programming experience were able to\nperform a variety of complex telemanipulation tasks with little training. Our\nresults show that our approach allowed users to create flexible periods of\nautonomy and solve rich manipulation tasks.

However, in the lack of common discipline-specific\nguidelines for artifacts evaluation, subjective and conflicting expectations\nmay happen and threaten artifact quality. In this paper, we discuss our\npreliminary ideas for a framework based on quality management principles (5W2H)\nthat can aid in the establishment of common guidelines for artifact evaluation\nand sharing. Also, using the Analytic Hierarchy Process, we discuss how\nresearch communities could join efforts to aid the guidelines' adequacy to\nresearch priorities.

    "title": "Towards Retrieval-based Conversational Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Conversational recommender systems have attracted immense attention recently.\nThe most recent approaches rely on neural models trained on recorded dialogs\nbetween humans, implementing an end-to-end learning process. These systems are\ncommonly designed to generate responses given the user's utterances in natural\nlanguage. One main challenge is that these generated responses both have to be\nappropriate for the given dialog context and must be grammatically and\nsemantically correct. An alternative to such generation-based approaches is to\nretrieve responses from pre-recorded dialog data and to adapt them if needed.\nSuch retrieval-based approaches were successfully explored in the context of\ngeneral conversational systems, but have received limited attention in recent\nyears for CRS. In this work, we re-assess the potential of such approaches and\ndesign and evaluate a novel technique for response retrieval and ranking. A\nuser study (N=90) revealed that the responses by our system were on average of\nhigher quality than those of two recent generation-based systems. We\nfurthermore found that the quality ranking of the two generation-based\napproaches is not aligned with the results from the literature, which points to\nopen methodological questions. Overall, our research underlines that\nretrieval-based approaches should be considered an alternative or complement to\nlanguage generation approaches.",

    "abstract": "Software model checking is a verification technique which is widely used for\nchecking temporal properties of software systems. Even though it is a property\nverification technique, its common usage in practice is in \"bug finding\", that\nis, finding violations of temporal properties. Motivated by this observation\nand leveraging the recent progress in fuzzing, we build a greybox fuzzing\nframework to find violations of Linear-time Temporal Logic (LTL) properties.\nOur framework takes as input a sequential program written in C/C++, and an\nLTL property. It finds violations, or counterexample traces, of the LTL\nproperty in stateful software systems; however, it does not achieve\nverification. Our work substantially extends directed greybox fuzzing to\nwitness arbitrarily complex event orderings. We note that existing directed\ngreybox fuzzing approaches are limited to witnessing reaching a location or\nwitnessing simple event orderings like use-after-free. At the same time,\ncompared to model checkers, our approach finds the counterexamples faster,\nthereby finding more counterexamples within a given time budget.\nOur LTL-Fuzzer tool, built on top of the AFL fuzzer, is shown to be effective\nin detecting bugs in well-known protocol implementations, such as OpenSSL and\nTelnet. We use LTL-Fuzzer to reproduce known vulnerabilities (CVEs), to find 15\nzero-day bugs by checking properties extracted from RFCs (for which 10 CVEs\nhave been assigned), and to find violations of both safety as well as liveness\nproperties in real-world protocol implementations. Our work represents a\npractical advance over software model checkers -- while simultaneously\nrepresenting a conceptual advance over existing greybox fuzzers. Our work thus\nprovides a starting point for understanding the unexplored synergies between\nsoftware model checking and greybox fuzzing.",

In this paper, in order to effectively\nutilize the higher-dimensional and complicated similarities among objects, we\nintroduce hypergraph to the framework of NTR to further enhance the feature\nextraction, upon which a hypergraph regularized nonnegative tensor ring\ndecomposition (HGNTR) method is developed.

    "abstract": "High-throughput satellite communications systems are growing in strategic\nimportance thanks to their role in delivering broadband services to mobile\nplatforms and residences and/or businesses in rural and remote regions\nglobally. Although precoding has emerged as a prominent technique to meet\never-increasing user demands, there is a lack of studies dealing with\ncongestion control. This paper enhances the performance of multi-beam high\nthroughput geostationary (GEO) satellite systems under congestion, where the\nusers' quality of service (QoS) demands cannot be fully satisfied with limited\nresources. In particular, we propose congestion control strategies, relying on\nsimple power control schemes. We formulate a multi-objective optimization\nframework balancing the system sum-rate and the number of users satisfying\ntheir QoS requirements. Next, we propose two novel approaches that effectively\nhandle the proposed multi-objective optimization problem. The former is a\nmodel-based approach that relies on the weighted sum method to enrich the\nnumber of satisfied users by solving a series of the sum-rate optimization\nproblems in an iterative manner. Meanwhile, the latter is a data-driven\napproach that offers a low-cost solution by utilizing supervised learning and\nexploiting the optimization structures as continuous mappings. The proposed\ngeneral framework is evaluated for different linear precoding techniques, for\nwhich the low computational complexity algorithms are designed. Numerical\nresults manifest that our proposed framework effectively handles the congestion\nissue and brings superior improvements of rate satisfaction to many users than\nprevious works. Furthermore, the proposed algorithms show low run-time, which\nmake them realistic for practical systems.",

Recent works intuitively apply contrastive\nlearning (CL) to learn representations, regarded as a pairwise manner, which is\nstill scalable: view-specific noise is not filtered in learning view-shared\nrepresentations; the fake negative pairs, where the negative terms are actually\nwithin the same class as the positive, and the real negative pairs are\ncoequally treated; and evenly measuring the similarities between terms might\ninterfere with optimization. Importantly, few works research the theoretical\nframework of generalized self-supervised multi-view learning, especially for\nmore than two views. To this end, we rethink the existing multi-view learning\nparadigm from the information theoretical perspective and then propose a novel\ninformation theoretical framework for generalized multi-view learning. Guided\nby it, we build a multi-view coding method with a three-tier progressive\narchitecture, namely Information theory-guided heuristic Progressive Multi-view\nCoding (IPMC). In the distribution-tier, IPMC aligns the distribution between\nviews to reduce view-specific noise. In the set-tier, IPMC builds self-adjusted\npools for contrasting, which utilizes a view filter to adaptively modify the\npools. Lastly, in the instance-tier, we adopt a designed unified loss to learn\ndiscriminative representations and reduce the gradient interference.\nTheoretically and empirically, we demonstrate the superiority of IPMC over\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain and distributed ledger technologies have received significant\ninterest in various areas beyond the financial sector, with profound\napplications in the Internet of Things (IoT), providing the means for creating\ntruly trustless and secure solutions for IoT applications. Taking into account\nthe weak security defences that the majority of IoT devices have, it is\ncritical that a blockchain-based solution targeting the IoT is not only capable\nof addressing the many challenges IoT is facing, but also does not introduce\nother defects, in terms of performance, making its adoption hard to achieve.\nThis paper aims at addressing the above needs by providing a comprehensive and\ncoherent review of the available blockchain solutions to determine their\nability to meet the requirements and tackle the challenges of the IoT, using\nthe smart home as the reference domain. Key architectural aspects of blockchain\nsolutions are examined in terms of their ability to withstand various types of\ncommon IoT and blockchain attacks, deliver enhanced privacy features, and\nassure adequate performance levels while processing large amounts of\ntransactions being generated in an IoT environment. The analysis carried out\nidentified that the defences currently provided by blockchain platforms are not\nsufficient to thwart all the prominent attacks against blockchains, with\nblockchain 1.0 and 2.0 platforms being susceptible to the majority of them. On\nthe other side, privacy related mechanisms are being supported, to varying\ndegrees, by all platforms investigated; however, each of the them tackles\nspecific only privacy aspects, thus rendering the overall privacy evaluation a\nchallenging task which needs to be considered in an ad-hoc basis. If the\nunderlying consensus protocols performance and fault tolerance is also\nconsidered, then only a small number of platforms meet the requirements of our\nreference IoT domain.",

    "abstract": "In practice, and more especially when training deep neural networks, visual\nrecognition rules are often learned based on various sources of information. On\nthe other hand, the recent deployment of facial recognition systems with uneven\npredictive performances on different population segments highlights the\nrepresentativeness issues possibly induced by a naive aggregation of image\ndatasets. Indeed, sampling bias does not vanish simply by considering larger\ndatasets, and ignoring its impact may completely jeopardize the generalization\ncapacity of the learned prediction rules. In this paper, we show how biasing\nmodels, originally introduced for nonparametric estimation in (Gill et al.,\n1988), and recently revisited from the perspective of statistical learning\ntheory in (Laforgue and Cl\\'emen\\c{c}on, 2019), can be applied to remedy these\nproblems in the context of visual recognition. Based on the (approximate)\nknowledge of the biasing mechanisms at work, our approach consists in\nreweighting the observations, so as to form a nearly debiased estimator of the\ntarget distribution. One key condition for our method to be theoretically valid\nis that the supports of the distributions generating the biased datasets at\ndisposal must overlap, and cover the support of the target distribution. In\norder to meet this requirement in practice, we propose to use a low dimensional\nimage representation, shared across the image databases. Finally, we provide\nnumerical experiments highlighting the relevance of our approach whenever the\nbiasing functions are appropriately chosen.",

GRL aims to capture the graph's structural\ninformation and exploit it in combination with node and edge attributes to\ncompute low-dimensional representations. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)\nhave been used in state-of-the-art GRL architectures, they have been shown to\nsuffer from over smoothing when many GNN layers need to be stacked. In a\ndifferent GRL approach, spectral methods based on graph filtering have emerged\naddressing over smoothing; however, up to now, they employ traditional neural\nnetworks that cannot efficiently exploit the structure of graph data.

This\narticle contributes to this small body of knowledge by providing a\nfirst-of-its-kind systematic mapping of the back-end infrastructural support\nthat makes up the tech stacks of Czech and Slovak untrustworthy websites.

The task aims at extending the identification of offensive language,\nby including additional subtasks that identify comments which should be\nprioritized for fact-checking by moderators and community managers. Our\ncontribution focuses on a feature-engineering approach with a conventional\nclassification backend. We combine semantic and writing style embeddings\nderived from pre-trained deep neural networks with additional numerical\nfeatures, specifically designed for this task. Ensembles of Logistic Regression\nclassifiers and Support Vector Machines are used to derive predictions for each\nsubtask via a majority voting scheme. Our best submission achieved\nmacro-averaged F1-scores of 66.8%, 69.9% and 72.5% for the identification of\ntoxic, engaging, and fact-claiming comments.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents our recent development on a portable and refreshable text\nreading and sensory substitution system for the blind or visually impaired\n(BVI), called Finger-eye. The system mainly consists of an opto-text processing\nunit and a compact electro-tactile based display that can deliver text-related\nelectrical signals to the fingertip skin through a wearable and Braille-dot\npatterned electrode array and thus delivers the electro-stimulation based\nBraille touch sensations to the fingertip. To achieve the goal of aiding BVI to\nread any text not written in Braille through this portable system, in this\nwork, a Rapid Optical Character Recognition (R-OCR) method is firstly developed\nfor real-time processing text information based on a Fisheye imaging device\nmounted at the finger-wearable electro-tactile display. This allows real-time\ntranslation of printed text to electro-Braille along with natural movement of\nuser's fingertip as if reading any Braille display or book. More importantly,\nan electro-tactile neuro-stimulation feedback mechanism is proposed and\nincorporated with the R-OCR method, which facilitates a new opto-electrotactile\nfeedback based text line tracking control approach that enables text line\nfollowing by user fingertip during reading. Multiple experiments were designed\nand conducted to test the ability of blindfolded participants to read through\nand follow the text line based on the opto-electrotactile-feedback method. The\nexperiments show that as the result of the opto-electrotactile-feedback, the\nusers were able to maintain their fingertip within a $2mm$ distance of the text\nwhile scanning a text line. This research is a significant step to aid the BVI\nusers with a portable means to translate and follow to read any printed text to\nBraille, whether in the digital realm or physically, on any surface.",

Ambiguity arises from discontinuity and decontextualization, from\nthe deliberate omission of facts, and from the skillful superimposition of\ncontradictory codes. An ontology of interactive media explains the elusive\nvisual poetry and image perception. The five basic elements of media are\npresented. The model shows the key correlations of user, content, and\ntechnology in image perception. An overview of utopian representation as a\ncross-media phenomenon places game design in an interdisciplinary context. Six\nselected computer-generated illustrations show how the above design criteria\ncan be successfully applied to the design of virtual worlds.

New IoT deployments (e.g., smart\ncity scenarios) can have thousands of devices per square kilometer leading to\nhuge amount of power consumption to provide connectivity. In this paper, we\ninvestigate green LoRa wireless networks powered by a hybrid of the grid and\nrenewable energy sources, which can benefit from harvested energy while dealing\nwith the intermittent supply. This paper proposes resource management schemes\nof the limited number of channels and spreading factors (SFs) with the\nobjective of improving the LoRa gateway energy efficiency. First, the problem\nof grid power consumption minimization while satisfying the system's quality of\nservice demands is formulated. Specifically, both scenarios the uncorrelated\nand time-correlated channels are investigated. The optimal resource management\nproblem is solved by decoupling the formulated problem into two sub-problems:\nchannel and SF assignment problem and energy management problem. Since the\noptimal solution is obtained with high complexity, online resource management\nheuristic algorithms that minimize the grid energy consumption are proposed.\nFinally, taking into account the channel and energy correlation, adaptable\nresource management schemes based on Reinforcement Learning (RL), are\ndeveloped.

    "abstract": "Federated learning is a novel framework that enables resource-constrained\nedge devices to jointly learn a model, which solves the problem of data\nprotection and data islands. However, standard federated learning is vulnerable\nto Byzantine attacks, which will cause the global model to be manipulated by\nthe attacker or fail to converge. On non-iid data, the current methods are not\neffective in defensing against Byzantine attacks. In this paper, we propose a\nByzantine-robust framework for federated learning via credibility assessment on\nnon-iid data (BRCA). Credibility assessment is designed to detect Byzantine\nattacks by combing adaptive anomaly detection model and data verification.\nSpecially, an adaptive mechanism is incorporated into the anomaly detection\nmodel for the training and prediction of the model. Simultaneously, a unified\nupdate algorithm is given to guarantee that the global model has a consistent\ndirection. On non-iid data, our experiments demonstrate that the BRCA is more\nrobust to Byzantine attacks compared with conventional methods",

    "abstract": "Advertising is critical to many online e-commerce platforms such as e-Bay and\nAmazon. One of the important signals that these platforms rely upon is the\nclick-through rate (CTR) prediction. The recent popularity of multi-modal\nsharing platforms such as TikTok has led to an increased interest in online\nmicro-videos. It is, therefore, useful to consider micro-videos to help a\nmerchant target micro-video advertising better and find users' favourites to\nenhance user experience. Existing works on CTR prediction largely exploit\nunimodal content to learn item representations. A relatively minimal effort has\nbeen made to leverage multi-modal information exchange among users and items.\nWe propose a model to exploit the temporal user-item interactions to guide the\nrepresentation learning with multi-modal features, and further predict the user\nclick rate of the micro-video item. We design a Hypergraph Click-Through Rate\nprediction framework (HyperCTR) built upon the hyperedge notion of hypergraph\nneural networks, which can yield modal-specific representations of users and\nmicro-videos to better capture user preferences. We construct a time-aware\nuser-item bipartite network with multi-modal information and enrich the\nrepresentation of each user and item with the generated interests-based user\nhypergraph and item hypergraph. Through extensive experiments on three public\ndatasets, we demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms\nvarious state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Aspect-level sentiment classification (ALSC) aims at identifying the\nsentiment polarity of a specified aspect in a sentence. ALSC is a practical\nsetting in aspect-based sentiment analysis due to no opinion term labeling\nneeded, but it fails to interpret why a sentiment polarity is derived for the\naspect. To address this problem, recent works fine-tune pre-trained Transformer\nencoders for ALSC to extract an aspect-centric dependency tree that can locate\nthe opinion words. However, the induced opinion words only provide an intuitive\ncue far below human-level interpretability. Besides, the pre-trained encoder\ntends to internalize an aspect's intrinsic sentiment, causing sentiment bias\nand thus affecting model performance. In this paper, we propose a span-based\nanti-bias aspect representation learning framework. It first eliminates the\nsentiment bias in the aspect embedding by adversarial learning against aspects'\nprior sentiment. Then, it aligns the distilled opinion candidates with the\naspect by span-based dependency modeling to highlight the interpretable opinion\nterms. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on five benchmarks,\nwith the capability of unsupervised opinion extraction.",

    "abstract": "Quantum computing hardware has progressed rapidly. Simultaneously, there has\nbeen a proliferation of programming languages and program optimization tools\nfor quantum computing. Existing quantum compilers use intermediate\nrepresentations (IRs) where quantum programs are described as circuits. Such\nIRs fail to leverage existing work on compiler optimizations. In such IRs, it\nis non-trivial to statically check for physical constraints such as the\nno-cloning theorem, which states that qubits cannot be copied. We introduce\nQSSA, a novel quantum IR based on static single assignment (SSA) that enables\ndecades of research in compiler optimizations to be applied to quantum\ncompilation. QSSA models quantum operations as being side-effect-free. The\ninputs and outputs of the operation are in one-to-one correspondence; qubits\ncannot be created or destroyed. As a result, our IR supports a static analysis\npass that verifies no-cloning at compile-time. The quantum circuit is fully\nencoded within the def-use chain of the IR, allowing us to leverage existing\noptimization passes on SSA representations such as redundancy elimination and\ndead-code elimination. Running our QSSA-based compiler on the QASMBench and IBM\nQuantum Challenge datasets, we show that our optimizations perform comparably\nto IBM's Qiskit quantum compiler infrastructure. QSSA allows us to represent,\nanalyze, and transform quantum programs using the robust theory of SSA\nrepresentations, bringing quantum compilation into the realm of well-understood\ntheory and practice.",

Physics-based models that capture the wake flow-field with high-fidelity\nare computationally very expensive to perform layout optimization of wind\nfarms, and, thus, data-driven reduced order models can represent an efficient\nalternative for simulating wind farms. In this work, we use real-world light\ndetection and ranging (LiDAR) measurements of wind-turbine wakes to construct\npredictive surrogate models using machine learning. Specifically, we first\ndemonstrate the use of deep autoencoders to find a low-dimensional\n\\emph{latent} space that gives a computationally tractable approximation of the\nwake LiDAR measurements. Then, we learn the mapping between the parameter space\nand the (latent space) wake flow-fields using a deep neural network.\nAdditionally, we also demonstrate the use of a probabilistic machine learning\ntechnique, namely, Gaussian process modeling, to learn the\nparameter-space-latent-space mapping in addition to the epistemic and aleatoric\nuncertainty in the data. Finally, to cope with training large datasets, we\ndemonstrate the use of variational Gaussian process models that provide a\ntractable alternative to the conventional Gaussian process models for large\ndatasets. Furthermore, we introduce the use of active learning to adaptively\nbuild and improve a conventional Gaussian process model predictive capability.\nOverall, we find that our approach provides accurate approximations of the\nwind-turbine wake flow field that can be queried at an orders-of-magnitude\ncheaper cost than those generated with high-fidelity physics-based simulations.",

Then, stochastic on-off switching dynamics of the Markov\nchain model, including time evolutions of PDFs, stationary PDFs and power\nspectral density functions of model-simulated postural sway are analyzed. We\nalso investigate how the stationary PDF alters as values of important\nparameters of the model change. Dynamics of the Markov chain model are compared\nwith Monte Carlo-based dynamics of the original intermittent control model, by\nwhich the developed numerical recipe and the resultant Markov chain model are\nvalidated.",

    "abstract": "Despite the remarkable success deep models have achieved in Textual Matching\n(TM), their robustness issue is still a topic of concern. In this work, we\npropose a new perspective to study this issue -- via the length divergence bias\nof TM models. We conclude that this bias stems from two parts: the label bias\nof existing TM datasets and the sensitivity of TM models to superficial\ninformation. We critically examine widely used TM datasets, and find that all\nof them follow specific length divergence distributions by labels, providing\ndirect cues for predictions. As for the TM models, we conduct adversarial\nevaluation and show that all models' performances drop on the\nout-of-distribution adversarial test sets we construct, which demonstrates that\nthey are all misled by biased training sets. This is also confirmed by the\n\\textit{SentLen} probing task that all models capture rich length information\nduring training to facilitate their performances. Finally, to alleviate the\nlength divergence bias in TM models, we propose a practical adversarial\ntraining method using bias-free training data. Our experiments indicate that we\nsuccessfully improve the robustness and generalization ability of models at the\nsame time.",

    "abstract": "The unprecedented global crisis brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic has\nsparked numerous efforts to create predictive models for the detection and\nprognostication of SARS-CoV-2 infections with the goal of helping health\nsystems allocate resources. Machine learning models, in particular, hold\npromise for their ability to leverage patient clinical information and medical\nimages for prediction. However, most of the published COVID-19 prediction\nmodels thus far have little clinical utility due to methodological flaws and\nlack of appropriate validation. In this paper, we describe our methodology to\ndevelop and validate multi-modal models for COVID-19 mortality prediction using\nmulti-center patient data. The models for COVID-19 mortality prediction were\ndeveloped using retrospective data from Madrid, Spain (N=2547) and were\nexternally validated in patient cohorts from a community hospital in New\nJersey, USA (N=242) and an academic center in Seoul, Republic of Korea (N=336).\nThe models we developed performed differently across various clinical settings,\nunderscoring the need for a guided strategy when employing machine learning for\nclinical decision-making. We demonstrated that using features from both the\nstructured electronic health records and chest X-ray imaging data resulted in\nbetter 30-day-mortality prediction performance across all three datasets (areas\nunder the receiver operating characteristic curves: 0.85 (95% confidence\ninterval: 0.83-0.87), 0.76 (0.70-0.82), and 0.95 (0.92-0.98)). We discuss the\nrationale for the decisions made at every step in developing the models and\nhave made our code available to the research community. We employed the best\nmachine learning practices for clinical model development. Our goal is to\ncreate a toolkit that would assist investigators and organizations in building\nmulti-modal models for prediction, classification and/or optimization.",

The proposed method utilizes\nclinical features extracted from the vertical Ground Reaction Force (vGRF),\nmeasured by 16 wearable sensors placed in the soles of subjects' shoes and\nlearns interpretable fuzzy rules. Therefore, experts can verify the decision\nmade by the proposed method based on investigating the firing strength of\ninterpretable fuzzy rules. Moreover, experts can utilize the extracted fuzzy\nrules for patient diagnosing or adjust them based on their knowledge. To\nimprove the robustness of the proposed method against uncertainty and noisy\nsensor measurements, Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic is applied. To learn fuzzy\nrules, two paradigms are proposed: 1- A batch learning approach based on\nclustering available samples is applied to extract initial fuzzy rules, 2- A\ncomplementary online learning is proposed to improve the rule base encountering\nnew labeled samples. The performance of the method is evaluated for classifying\npatients and healthy subjects in different conditions including the presence of\nnoise or observing new instances. Moreover, the performance of the model is\ncompared to some previous supervised and unsupervised machine learning\napproaches. The final Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score of the proposed\nmethod are 88.74%, 89.41%, 95.10%, and 92.16%. Finally, the extracted fuzzy\nsets for each feature are reported.",

    "abstract": "Top-N recommendation, which aims to learn user ranking-based preference, has\nlong been a fundamental problem in a wide range of applications. Traditional\nmodels usually motivate themselves by designing complex or tailored\narchitectures based on different assumptions. However, the training data of\nrecommender system can be extremely sparse and imbalanced, which poses great\nchallenges for boosting the recommendation performance. To alleviate this\nproblem, in this paper, we propose to reformulate the recommendation task\nwithin the causal inference framework, which enables us to counterfactually\nsimulate user ranking-based preferences to handle the data scarce problem. The\ncore of our model lies in the counterfactual question: \"what would be the\nuser's decision if the recommended items had been different?\". To answer this\nquestion, we firstly formulate the recommendation process with a series of\nstructural equation models (SEMs), whose parameters are optimized based on the\nobserved data. Then, we actively indicate many recommendation lists (called\nintervention in the causal inference terminology) which are not recorded in the\ndataset, and simulate user feedback according to the learned SEMs for\ngenerating new training samples. Instead of randomly intervening on the\nrecommendation list, we design a learning-based method to discover more\ninformative training samples. Considering that the learned SEMs can be not\nperfect, we, at last, theoretically analyze the relation between the number of\ngenerated samples and the model prediction error, based on which a heuristic\nmethod is designed to control the negative effect brought by the prediction\nerror. Extensive experiments are conducted based on both synthetic and\nreal-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.",

Examples provide a precise but incomplete\nspecification, and natural language provides an ambiguous but more \"complete\"\ntask description. Machine-learned pre-trained models (PTMs) are adept at\nhandling ambiguous natural language, but struggle with generating syntactically\nand semantically precise code. Program synthesis techniques can generate\ncorrect code, often even from incomplete but precise specifications, such as\nexamples, but they are unable to work with the ambiguity of natural languages.\nWe present an approach that combines PTMs with component-based synthesis (CBS):\nPTMs are used to generate candidates programs from the natural language\ndescription of the task, which are then used to guide the CBS procedure to find\nthe program that matches the precise examples-based specification. We use our\ncombination approach to instantiate multi-modal synthesis systems for two\nprogramming domains: the domain of regular expressions and the domain of CSS\nselectors.

It aims to address the data silo and privacy problems altogether.\nCurrent federated recommender systems mainly utilize homomorphic encryption and\ndifferential privacy methods to protect the intermediate computational results.\nHowever, the former comes with extra communication and computation costs, the\nlatter damages model accuracy. Neither of them could simultaneously satisfy the\nreal-time feedback and accurate personalization requirements of recommender\nsystems.

Federated masked matrix\nfactorization could protect the data privacy in federated recommender systems\nwithout sacrificing efficiency or efficacy. Instead of using homomorphic\nencryption and differential privacy, we utilize the secret sharing technique to\nincorporate the secure aggregation process of federated matrix factorization.\nCompared with homomorphic encryption, secret sharing largely speeds up the\nwhole training process. In addition, we introduce a new idea of personalized\nmasks and apply it in the proposed federated masked matrix factorization\nframework. On the one hand, personalized masks could further improve\nefficiency. On the other hand, personalized masks also benefit efficacy.\nEmpirically, we show the superiority of the designed model on different\nreal-world data sets.

    "abstract": "This paper aims to unify spatial dependency and temporal dependency in a\nnon-Euclidean space while capturing the inner spatial-temporal dependencies for\nspatial-temporal graph data. For spatial-temporal attribute entities with\ntopological structure, the space-time is consecutive and unified while each\nnode's current status is influenced by its neighbors' past states over variant\nperiods of each neighbor. Most spatial-temporal neural networks study spatial\ndependency and temporal correlation separately in processing, gravely impaired\nthe space-time continuum, and ignore the fact that the neighbors' temporal\ndependency period for a node can be delayed and dynamic. To model this actual\ncondition, we propose TraverseNet, a novel spatial-temporal graph neural\nnetwork, viewing space and time as an inseparable whole, to mine\nspatial-temporal graphs while exploiting the evolving spatial-temporal\ndependencies for each node via message traverse mechanisms. Experiments with\nablation and parameter studies have validated the effectiveness of the proposed\nTraverseNets, and the detailed implementation can be found from\nhttps://github.com/nnzhan/TraverseNet.",

Conventional 3D\nconvolutional backbones in voxel-based 3D detectors cannot efficiently capture\nlarge context information, which is crucial for object recognition and\nlocalization, owing to the limited receptive fields. In this paper, we resolve\nthe problem by introducing a Transformer-based architecture that enables\nlong-range relationships between voxels by self-attention. Given the fact that\nnon-empty voxels are naturally sparse but numerous, directly applying standard\nTransformer on voxels is non-trivial. To this end, we propose the sparse voxel\nmodule and the submanifold voxel module, which can operate on the empty and\nnon-empty voxel positions effectively. To further enlarge the attention range\nwhile maintaining comparable computational overhead to the convolutional\ncounterparts, we propose two attention mechanisms for multi-head attention in\nthose two modules: Local Attention and Dilated Attention, and we further\npropose Fast Voxel Query to accelerate the querying process in multi-head\nattention. VoTr contains a series of sparse and submanifold voxel modules and\ncan be applied in most voxel-based detectors.

    "abstract": "We present a flexible and high-performance framework, named Pyramid R-CNN,\nfor two-stage 3D object detection from point clouds. Current approaches\ngenerally rely on the points or voxels of interest for RoI feature extraction\non the second stage, but cannot effectively handle the sparsity and non-uniform\ndistribution of those points, and this may result in failures in detecting\nobjects that are far away. To resolve the problems, we propose a novel\nsecond-stage module, named pyramid RoI head, to adaptively learn the features\nfrom the sparse points of interest. The pyramid RoI head consists of three key\ncomponents. Firstly, we propose the RoI-grid Pyramid, which mitigates the\nsparsity problem by extensively collecting points of interest for each RoI in a\npyramid manner. Secondly, we propose RoI-grid Attention, a new operation that\ncan encode richer information from sparse points by incorporating conventional\nattention-based and graph-based point operators into a unified formulation.\nThirdly, we propose the Density-Aware Radius Prediction (DARP) module, which\ncan adapt to different point density levels by dynamically adjusting the\nfocusing range of RoIs. Combining the three components, our pyramid RoI head is\nrobust to the sparse and imbalanced circumstances, and can be applied upon\nvarious 3D backbones to consistently boost the detection performance.

To be practically viable, mmWave massive MU-MIMO basestations (BSs)\nmust rely on low-resolution data converters which leaves them vulnerable to\njammer interference. This paper proposes beam-slicing, a method that mitigates\nthe impact of a permanently transmitting jammer during uplink transmission for\nBSs equipped with low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs).\nBeam-slicing is a localized analog spatial transform that focuses the jammer\nenergy onto few ADCs, so that the transmitted data can be recovered based on\nthe outputs of the interference-free ADCs. We demonstrate the efficacy of\nbeam-slicing in combination with two digital jammer-mitigating data detectors:\nSNIPS and CHOPS. Soft-Nulling of Interferers with Partitions in Space (SNIPS)\ncombines beam-slicing with a soft-nulling data detector that exploits knowledge\nof the ADC contamination; projeCtion onto ortHOgonal complement with Partitions\nin Space (CHOPS) combines beam-slicing with a linear projection that removes\nall signal components co-linear to an estimate of the jammer channel.

    "abstract": "In various contexts of networking research, end-host path selection has\nrecently regained momentum as a design principle. While such path selection has\nthe potential to increase performance and security of networks, there is a\nprominent concern that it could also lead to network instability (i.e.,\nflow-volume oscillation) if paths are selected in a greedy, load-adaptive\nfashion. However, the extent and the impact vectors of instability caused by\npath selection are rarely concretized or quantified, which is essential to\ndiscuss the merits and drawbacks of end-host path selection.\nIn this work, we investigate the effect of end-host path selection on various\nmetrics of networks both qualitatively and quantitatively. To achieve general\nand fundamental insights, we leverage the recently introduced axiomatic\nperspective on congestion control and adapt it to accommodate joint algorithms\nfor path selection and congestion control, i.e., multi-path congestion-control\nprotocols. Using this approach, we identify equilibria of the multi-path\ncongestion-control dynamics and analytically characterize these equilibria with\nrespect to important metrics of interest in networks (the 'axioms') such as\nefficiency, fairness, and loss avoidance. Moreover, we analyze how these\naxiomatic ratings for a general network change compared to a scenario without\npath selection, thereby obtaining an interpretable and quantititative\nformalization of the performance impact of end-host path-selection. Finally, we\nshow that there is a fundamental trade-off in multi-path congestion-control\nprotocol design between efficiency, stability, and loss avoidance on one side\nand fairness and responsiveness on the other side.",

    "abstract": "Cloud Computing (CC) is the most prevalent paradigm under which services are\nprovided over the Internet. The most relevant feature for its success is its\ncapability to promptly scale service based on user demand. When scaling, the\nmain objective is to maximize as much as possible service performance.\nMoreover, resources in the Cloud are usually so abundant, that they can be\nassumed infinite from the service point of view: an application provider can\nhave as many servers it wills, as long it pays for it. This model has some\nlimitations. First, energy efficiency is not among the first criteria for\nscaling decisions, which has raised concerns about the environmental effects of\ntoday's wild computations in the Cloud. Moreover, it is not viable for Edge\nComputing (EC), a paradigm in which computational resources are distributed up\nto the very edge of the network, i.e., co-located with base stations or access\npoints. In edge nodes, resources are limited, which imposes different\nparsimonious scaling strategies to be adopted. In this work, we design a\nscaling strategy aimed to instantiate, parsimoniously, a number of\nmicroservices sufficient to guarantee a certain Quality of Service (QoS)\ntarget. We implement such a strategy in a Kubernetes/Docker environment. The\nstrategy is based on a simple Proportional-Integrative-Derivative (PID)\ncontroller.

Although\nvarious data-driven vulnerability detection methods have been proposed, the\ntask remains challenging since the diversity and complexity of real-world\nvulnerable code in syntax and semantics make it difficult to extract vulnerable\nfeatures with regular deep learning models, especially in analyzing a large\nprogram. Moreover, the fact that real-world vulnerable codes contain a lot of\nredundant information unrelated to vulnerabilities will further aggravate the\nabove problem. To mitigate such challenges, we define a novel code\nrepresentation named Slice Property Graph (SPG), and then propose VulSPG, a new\nvulnerability detection approach using the improved R-GCN model with triple\nattention mechanism to identify potential vulnerabilities in SPG. Our approach\nhas at least two advantages over other methods. First, our proposed SPG can\nreflect the rich semantics and explicit structural information that may be\nrelevance to vulnerabilities, while eliminating as much irrelevant information\nas possible to reduce the complexity of graph. Second, VulSPG incorporates\ntriple attention mechanism in R-GCNs to achieve more effective learning of\nvulnerability patterns from SPG. We have extensively evaluated VulSPG on two\nlarge-scale datasets with programs from SARD and real-world projects.\nExperimental results prove the effectiveness and efficiency of VulSPG.",

    "abstract": "API economy is driving the digital transformation of business applications\nacross the hybrid Cloud and edge environments. For such transformations to\nsucceed, end-to-end testing of the application API composition is required.\nTesting of API compositions, even in centralized Cloud environments, is\nchallenging as it requires coverage of functional as well as reliability\nrequirements. The combinatorial space of scenarios is huge, e.g., API input\nparameters, order of API execution, and network faults. Hybrid Cloud and edge\nenvironments exacerbate the challenge of API testing due to the need to\ncoordinate test execution across dynamic wide-area networks, possibly across\nnetwork boundaries. To handle this challenge, we envision a test framework\nnamed Distributed Software Test Kit (DSTK). The DSTK leverages Combinatorial\nTest Design (CTD) to cover the functional requirements and then automatically\ncovers the reliability requirements via under-the-hood closed loop between test\nexecution feedback and AI based search algorithms. In each iteration of the\nclosed loop, the search algorithms generate more reliability test scenarios to\nbe executed next. Specifically, five kinds of reliability tests are envisioned:\nout-of-order execution of APIs, network delays and faults, API performance and\nthroughput, changes in API call graph patterns, and changes in application\ntopology.",

We also introduce the pedestrian map that specifies\nthe movements of pedestrians around the robot. By applying both maps as inputs\nof the neural network, we show that a navigation policy can be trained to\nbetter interact with pedestrians following different collision avoidance\nstrategies. We evaluate our approach under multiple scenarios both in the\nsimulator and on an actual robot.

It was then used to create a data-set of\n\"fake\" patients through synthetic data generation (SDG) to circumvent usage\nconstraints. This real-world data was tabular, binary, intensive care unit\n(ICU) patient diagnosis data. The entire data-set was split into separate data\nsilos to mimic real-world scenarios where multiple ICU units across different\nhospitals may have similarly structured data-sets within their own\norganisations but do not have access to each other's data-sets. We implemented\nfederated learning (FL) to train separate GANs locally at each organisation,\nusing their unique data silo and then combining the GANs into a single central\nGAN, without any siloed data ever being exposed. This global, central GAN was\nthen used to generate the synthetic patients data-set. We performed an\nevaluation of these synthetic patients with statistical measures and through a\nstructured review by a group of medical professionals. It was shown that there\nwas no significant reduction in the quality of the synthetic EHR when we moved\nbetween training a single central model and training on separate data silos\nwith individual models before combining them into a central model. This was\ntrue for both the statistical evaluation (Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of\n0.0154 for single-source vs. RMSE of 0.0169 for dual-source federated) and also\nfor the medical professionals' evaluation (no quality difference between EHR\ngenerated from a single source and EHR generated from multiple sources).",

We will especially investigate the usefulness of\napplying these algorithms to automatically defend against potential internal\nthreats, without human intervention. The effectiveness of these two models is\nevaluated on the public dataset CERT dataset (CERT r4.2). This version of the\nCERT Insider Threat Test dataset includes both benign and malicious activities\ngenerated from 1000 simulated users. The comparison results with other models\nshow that the Variational Autoencoder neural network provides the best overall\nperformance with a greater detection accuracy and a reasonable false positive\nrate",

    "title": "Enhancing Language Models with Plug-and-Play Large-Scale Commonsense",
    "abstract": "We study how to enhance language models (LMs) with textual commonsense\nknowledge. Previous work (e.g., KnowBERT) has focused on the integrating entity\nknowledge from knowledge graphs. In order to introduce the external entity\nembeddings, they learn to jointly represent the original sentences and external\nknowledge by pre-training on a large scale corpus. However, when switching to\ntextual commonsense, unlike the light entity embeddings, the encoding of\ncommonsense descriptions is heavy. Therefore, the pre-training for learning to\njointly represent the target sentence and external commonsense descriptions is\nunaffordable. On the other hand, since pre-trained LMs for representing the\ntarget sentences alone are readily available, is it feasible to introduce\ncommonsense knowledge in downstream tasks by fine-tuning them only? In this\npaper, we propose a plug-and-play method for large-scale commonsense\nintegration without pre-training. Our method is inspired by the observation\nthat in the regular fine-tuning for downstream tasks where no external\nknowledge was introduced, the variation in the parameters of the language model\nwas minor. Our method starts from a pre-trained LM that represents the target\nsentences only (e.g., BERT). We think that the pre-training for joint\nrepresentation learning can be avoided, if the joint representation reduces the\nimpact of parameters on the starting LM. Previous methods such as KnowBERT\nproposed complex modifications to the vanilla LM to introduce external\nknowledge. Our model (Cook-Transformer, COmmOnsense Knowledge-enhanced\nTransformer), on the other hand, hardly changes the vanilla LM except adding a\nknowledge token in each Transformer layer. In a variety of experiments,\nCOOK-Transformer-based BERT/RoBERTa improve their effect without any\npre-training.",

    "abstract": "Modern semantic parsers suffer from two principal limitations. First,\ntraining requires expensive collection of utterance-program pairs. Second,\nsemantic parsers fail to generalize at test time to new compositions/structures\nthat have not been observed during training. Recent research has shown that\nautomatic generation of synthetic utterance-program pairs can alleviate the\nfirst problem, but its potential for the second has thus far been\nunder-explored. In this work, we investigate automatic generation of synthetic\nutterance-program pairs for improving compositional generalization in semantic\nparsing. Given a small training set of annotated examples and an \"infinite\"\npool of synthetic examples, we select a subset of synthetic examples that are\nstructurally-diverse and use them to improve compositional generalization. We\nevaluate our approach on a new split of the schema2QA dataset, and show that it\nleads to dramatic improvements in compositional generalization as well as\nmoderate improvements in the traditional i.i.d setup. Moreover,\nstructurally-diverse sampling achieves these improvements with as few as 5K\nexamples, compared to 1M examples when sampling uniformly at random -- a 200x\nimprovement in data efficiency.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we prove a hypercontractive inequality for matrix-valued\nfunctions defined over large alphabets, generalizing a result of Ben-Aroya,\nRegev, de Wolf (FOCS'08) for the Boolean alphabet. To obtain our result we\ngeneralize the powerful $2$-uniform convexity inequality for trace norms of\nBall, Carlen, Lieb (Inventiones Mathematicae'94). We give two applications of\nthis hypercontractive inequality.\nLocally decodable codes (LDC): we present a lower bound for LDCs over large\nalphabets. An LDC $C:\\mathbb{Z}_r^n\\to \\mathbb{Z}_r^N$ encodes\n$x\\in\\mathbb{Z}_r^n$ into a codeword $C(x)$ such that one can recover any $x_i$\n(with probability at least $1/r+\\varepsilon$) by making a few queries to a\ncorrupted codeword. The main question is the trade-off between $N$ and $n$. By\nusing hypercontractivity, we prove that $N=2^{\\Omega(\\varepsilon^4 n/r^4)}$ for\n$2$-query (possibly non-linear) LDCs over $\\mathbb{Z}_r$. Previously\nexponential lower bounds were known for $r=2$ (Kerenidis and de Wolf (JCSS'04))\nand for linear codes (Dvir and Shpilka (SICOMP'07)).\nStreaming algorithms: we present upper and lower bounds for the communication\ncomplexity of the Hidden Hypermatching problem when defined over large\nalphabets, which generalizes the well-known Boolean Hidden Matching problem. We\nthen consider streaming algorithms for approximating the value of Unique Games\non a $t$-hyperedge hypergraph: a simple edge-counting argument gives an\n$r$-approximation with $O(\\log{n})$ space. On the other hand, we use our\ncommunication lower bound to show that any streaming algorithm in the\nadversarial model achieving a $(r-\\varepsilon)$-approximation requires\n$\\Omega(n^{1-1/t})$ classical or $\\Omega(n^{1-2/t})$ quantum space.

In this\npaper, we propose a novel attention mechanism, the Class Semantics-based\nAttention (CSA), that learns from the temporal distribution of semantics of\naction classes present in an input video to find the importance scores of the\nencoded features, which are used to provide attention to the more useful\nencoded features.

    "abstract": "Video summarization aims to simplify large scale video browsing by generating\nconcise, short summaries that diver from but well represent the original video.\nDue to the scarcity of video annotations, recent progress for video\nsummarization concentrates on unsupervised methods, among which the GAN based\nmethods are most prevalent. This type of methods includes a summarizer and a\ndiscriminator. The summarized video from the summarizer will be assumed as the\nfinal output, only if the video reconstructed from this summary cannot be\ndiscriminated from the original one by the discriminator. The primary problems\nof this GAN based methods are two folds. First, the summarized video in this\nway is a subset of original video with low redundancy and contains high\npriority events/entities. This summarization criterion is not enough. Second,\nthe training of the GAN framework is not stable. This paper proposes a novel\nEntity relationship Aware video summarization method (ERA) to address the above\nproblems. To be more specific, we introduce an Adversarial Spatio Temporal\nnetwork to construct the relationship among entities, which we think should\nalso be given high priority in the summarization. The GAN training problem is\nsolved by introducing the Wasserstein GAN and two newly proposed video\npatch/score sum losses. In addition, the score sum loss can also relieve the\nmodel sensitivity to the varying video lengths, which is an inherent problem\nfor most current video analysis tasks. Our method substantially lifts the\nperformance on the target benchmark datasets and exceeds the current\nleaderboard Rank 1 state of the art CSNet (2.1% F1 score increase on TVSum and\n3.1% F1 score increase on SumMe).

    "abstract": "A novel framework has recently been proposed for designing the molecular\nstructure of chemical compounds with a desired chemical property using both\nartificial neural networks and mixed integer linear programming. In this paper,\nwe design a new method for inferring a polymer based on the framework. For\nthis, we introduce a new way of representing a polymer as a form of monomer and\ndefine new descriptors that feature the structure of polymers. We also use\nlinear regression as a building block of constructing a prediction function in\nthe framework. The results of our computational experiments reveal a set of\nchemical properties on polymers to which a prediction function constructed with\nlinear regression performs well. We also observe that the proposed method can\ninfer polymers with up to 50 non-hydrogen atoms in a monomer form.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous driving is the key technology of intelligent logistics in\nIndustrial Internet of Things (IIoT). In autonomous driving, the appearance of\nincomplete point clouds losing geometric and semantic information is inevitable\nowing to limitations of occlusion, sensor resolution, and viewing angle when\nthe Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) is applied. The emergence of incomplete\npoint clouds, especially incomplete vehicle point clouds, would lead to the\nreduction of the accuracy of autonomous driving vehicles in object detection,\ntraffic alert, and collision avoidance. Existing point cloud completion\nnetworks, such as Point Fractal Network (PF-Net), focus on the accuracy of\npoint cloud completion, without considering the efficiency of inference\nprocess, which makes it difficult for them to be deployed for vehicle point\ncloud repair in autonomous driving. To address the above problem, in this\npaper, we propose an efficient deep learning approach to repair incomplete\nvehicle point cloud accurately and efficiently in autonomous driving. In the\nproposed method, an efficient downsampling algorithm combining incremental\nsampling and one-time sampling is presented to improves the inference speed of\nthe PF-Net based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). To evaluate the\nperformance of the proposed method, a real dataset is used, and an autonomous\ndriving scene is created, where three incomplete vehicle point clouds with 5\ndifferent sizes are set for three autonomous driving situations. The improved\nPF-Net can achieve the speedups of over 19x with almost the same accuracy when\ncompared to the original PF-Net. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nimproved PF-Net can be applied to efficiently complete vehicle point clouds in\nautonomous driving.",

Astronomers have invested heavily in knowledge\ninfrastructures - robust networks of people, artifacts, and institutions that\ngenerate, share, and maintain specific knowledge about the human and natural\nworlds. Drawing upon a decade of interviews and ethnography, this article\ncompares how three astronomy groups capture, process, and archive data, and for\nwhom. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey is a mission with a dedicated telescope and\ninstruments, while the Black Hole Group and Integrative Astronomy Group (both\npseudonyms) are university-based, investigator-led collaborations. Findings are\norganized into four themes: how these projects develop and maintain their\nworkflows; how they capture and archive their data; how they maintain and\nrepair knowledge infrastructures; and how they use and reuse data products over\ntime. We found that astronomers encode their research methods in software known\nas pipelines. Algorithms help to point telescopes at targets, remove artifacts,\ncalibrate instruments, and accomplish myriad validation tasks. Observations may\nbe reprocessed many times to become new data products that serve new scientific\npurposes. Knowledge production in the form of scientific publications is the\nprimary goal of these projects. They vary in incentives and resources to\nsustain access to their data products. We conclude that software pipelines are\nessential components of astronomical knowledge infrastructures, but are\nfragile, difficult to maintain and repair, and often invisible. Reusing data\nproducts is fundamental to the science of astronomy, whether or not those\nresources are made publicly available.

To alleviate the communication burden,\nsign-based optimization algorithms have gained popularity recently in both\nindustrial and academic communities, which is shown to be closely related to\nadaptive gradient methods, such as Adam. Along this line, this paper\ninvestigates faster convergence for a variant of sign-based gradient descent,\ncalled scaled signGD, in three cases: 1) the objective function is strongly\nconvex; 2) the objective function is nonconvex but satisfies the\nPolyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) inequality; 3) the gradient is stochastic, called\nscaled signGD in this case. For the first two cases, it can be shown that the\nscaled signGD converges at a linear rate. For case 3), the algorithm is shown\nto converge linearly to a neighborhood of the optimal value when a constant\nlearning rate is employed, and the algorithm converges at a rate of $O(1/k)$\nwhen using a diminishing learning rate, where $k$ is the iteration number. The\nresults are also extended to the distributed setting by majority vote in a\nparameter-server framework.

The isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene mutation status provides\ncritical diagnostic and prognostic value for glioma and is now accepted as the\nstandard of care. A non-invasive prediction of IDH mutation based on the\npre-treatment MRI has crucial clinical significance. Machine learning and deep\nlearning models show reasonable performance in predicting IDH mutation status.\nHowever, most models neglect the systematic brain alterations caused by tumor\ninvasion, where the infiltration along white matter tracts throughout the brain\nis identified as a hallmark of glioma. Structural brain network provides an\neffective tool to characterise brain organisation, which could be captured by\nthe graph neural networks (GNN) for a more accurate prediction of IDH mutation\nstatus.\nHere we propose a method to predict the IDH mutation using GNN, based on the\nstructural brain network of patients. Specifically, we firstly construct a\nnetwork template of healthy subjects, which consists of atlases of edges (white\nmatter tracts) and nodes (cortical and subcortical brain regions) to provide\nregions of interest (ROI). Next, we employ autoencoders to extract the latent\nmulti-modal MRI features from the ROIs of the edge and node in patients. These\nfeatures of edge and node of brain networks are used to train a GNN\narchitecture in predicting IDH mutation status. The results show that the\nproposed method outperforms the baseline models using 3D-CNN and 3D-DenseNet.\nIn addition, the model interpretation suggests its ability to identify the\ntracts infiltrated by tumor and corresponds to clinical prior knowledge.

    "abstract": "This paper presents an automatic algorithm for the segmentation of areas\naffected by an acute stroke on the non-contrast computed tomography brain\nimages. The proposed algorithm is designed for learning in a weakly supervised\nscenario when some images are labeled accurately, and some images are labeled\ninaccurately. Wrong labels appear as a result of inaccuracy made by a\nradiologist in the process of manual annotation of computed tomography images.\nWe propose methods for solving the segmentation problem in the case of\ninaccurately labeled training data. We use the U-Net neural network\narchitecture with several modifications. Experiments on real computed\ntomography scans show that the proposed methods increase the segmentation\naccuracy.",

    "abstract": "This work gives a Lie operator derivation of various Boris solvers via a\ndetailed study of first and second-order trajectory errors in a constant\nmagnetic field. These errors in the gyro-circle center and gyro-radius are the\nfoundational basis for why Boris solvers existed, independent of any\nfinite-difference schemes. The elimination of these errors then forces the\nsecond-order solver's trajectory to be exactly on the gyro-circle. By\nrevisiting some historical calculations, it is found that many publications do\nnot distinguish the poorly behaved first-order leap-frog solver with the\ncorrect second-order Boris algorithm. This work shows that this second-order\nBoris solver is much more accurate then previously thought and that its\ntrajectory remains close to the exact orbit in a combined $nonuniform$ electric\nand magnetic field at time-steps greater than the cyclotron period.",

In the past few years, deep\nlearning has gained huge attention from the research community and produced\npromising image reconstruction results. Therefore, recent methods focused on\ndeveloping deeper and more complex networks, which significantly increased\nnetwork complexity. In this paper, two effective novel blocks are developed:\nanalysis and synthesis block that employs the convolution layer and Generalized\nDivisive Normalization (GDN) in the variable-rate encoder and decoder side. Our\nnetwork utilizes a pixel RNN approach for quantization. Furthermore, to improve\nthe whole network, we encode a residual image using LSTM cells to reduce\nunnecessary information.

In this work, we\npropose a multi-scale, multi-level attention embedded CNN architecture\n((M)SLAe-Net) to address the issue of multi-stage processing for robust and\nprecise segmentation of retinal vessels. We do this by extracting features at\nmultiple scales and multiple levels of the network, enabling our model to\nholistically extracts the local and global features.

    "abstract": "Classification has been a major task for building intelligent systems as it\nenables decision-making under uncertainty. Classifier design aims at building\nmodels from training data for representing feature-label distributions--either\nexplicitly or implicitly. In many scientific or clinical settings, training\ndata are typically limited, which makes designing accurate classifiers and\nevaluating their classification error extremely challenging. While transfer\nlearning (TL) can alleviate this issue by incorporating data from relevant\nsource domains to improve learning in a different target domain, it has\nreceived little attention for performance assessment, notably in error\nestimation. In this paper, we fill this gap by investigating knowledge\ntransferability in the context of classification error estimation within a\nBayesian paradigm. We introduce a novel class of Bayesian minimum mean-square\nerror (MMSE) estimators for optimal Bayesian transfer learning (OBTL), which\nenables rigorous evaluation of classification error under uncertainty in a\nsmall-sample setting. Using Monte Carlo importance sampling, we employ the\nproposed estimator to evaluate the classification accuracy of a broad family of\nclassifiers that span diverse learning capabilities.

In this work, we propose an\nautomatic RV segmentation framework, where the information from long-axis (LA)\nviews is utilized to assist the segmentation of short-axis (SA) views via\ninformation transition. Specifically, we employed the transformed segmentation\nfrom LA views as a prior information, to extract the ROI from SA views for\nbetter segmentation. The information transition aims to remove the surrounding\nambiguous regions in the SA views. %, such as the tricuspid valve regions. We\ntested our model on a public dataset with 360 multi-center, multi-vendor and\nmulti-disease subjects that consist of both LA and SA MRIs. Our experimental\nresults show that including LA views can be effective to improve the accuracy\nof the SA segmentation. Our model is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/NanYoMy/MMs-2.",

    "abstract": "Plant water stress may occur due to the limited availability of water to the\nroots/soil or due to increased transpiration. These factors adversely affect\nplant physiology and photosynthetic ability to the extent that it has been\nshown to have inhibitory effects in both growth and yield [18]. Early\nidentification of plant water stress status enables suitable corrective\nmeasures to be applied to obtain the expected crop yield. Further, improving\ncrop yield through precision agriculture methods is a key component of climate\npolicy and the UN sustainable development goals [1]. Leaf water content (LWC)\nis a measure that can be used to estimate water content and identify stressed\nplants. LWC during the early crop growth stages is an important indicator of\nplant productivity and yield. The effect of water stress can be instantaneous\n[15], affecting gaseous exchange or long-term, significantly reducing [9, 18,\n22]. It is thus necessary to identify potential plant water stress during the\nearly stages of growth [15] to introduce corrective irrigation and alleviate\nstress. LWC is also useful for identifying plant genotypes that are tolerant to\nwater stress and salinity by measuring the stability of LWC even under\nartificially induced water stress [18, 25]. Such experiments generally employ\ndestructive procedures to obtain the LWC, which is time-consuming and labor\nintensive. Accordingly, this research has developed a non-destructive method to\nestimate LWC from UAV-based hyperspectral data.",

    "abstract": "Radiomics is an active area of research focusing on high throughput feature\nextraction from medical images with a wide array of applications in clinical\npractice, such as clinical decision support in oncology. However, noise in low\ndose computed tomography (CT) scans can impair the accurate extraction of\nradiomic features. In this article, we investigate the possibility of using\ndeep learning generative models to improve the performance of radiomics from\nlow dose CTs. We used two datasets of low dose CT scans -NSCLC Radiogenomics\nand LIDC-IDRI - as test datasets for two tasks - pre-treatment survival\nprediction and lung cancer diagnosis. We used encoder-decoder networks and\nconditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs) trained in a previous study\nas generative models to transform low dose CT images into full dose CT images.\nRadiomic features extracted from the original and improved CT scans were used\nto build two classifiers - a support vector machine (SVM) and a deep attention\nbased multiple instance learning model - for survival prediction and lung\ncancer diagnosis respectively. Finally, we compared the performance of the\nmodels derived from the original and improved CT scans. Encoder-decoder\nnetworks and CGANs improved the area under the curve (AUC) of survival\nprediction from 0.52 to 0.57 (p-value<0.01). On the other hand, Encoder-decoder\nnetwork and CGAN can improve the AUC of lung cancer diagnosis from 0.84 to 0.88\nand 0.89 respectively (p-value<0.01). Moreover, there are no statistically\nsignificant differences in improving AUC by using encoder-decoder network and\nCGAN (p-value=0.34) when networks trained at 75 and 100 epochs. Generative\nmodels can improve the performance of low dose CT-based radiomics in different\ntasks. Hence, denoising using generative models seems to be a necessary\npre-processing step for calculating radiomic features from low dose CTs.",

The biggest goal in these searches is whether there are\nother life-harbouring planets. However, the question which of these detected\nplanets are habitable, potentially-habitable, or maybe even inhabited, is still\nnot answered. Some potentially habitable exoplanets have been hypothesized, but\nsince Earth is the only known habitable planet, measures of habitability are\nnecessarily determined with Earth as the reference. Several recent works\nintroduced new habitability metrics based on optimization methods.\nClassification of potentially habitable exoplanets using supervised learning is\nanother emerging area of study.

We propose an anomaly detection method, the\nMulti-Stage Memetic Algorithm (MSMA), to detect anomalies and extend it to an\nunsupervised clustering algorithm MSMVMCA to use it to detect potentially\nhabitable exoplanets as anomalies. The algorithm is based on the postulate that\nEarth is an anomaly, with the possibility of existence of few other anomalies\namong thousands of data points. We describe an MSMA-based clustering approach\nwith a novel distance function to detect habitable candidates as anomalies\n(including Earth). The results are cross-matched with the habitable exoplanet\ncatalog (PHL-HEC) of the Planetary Habitability Laboratory (PHL) with both\noptimistic and conservative lists of potentially habitable exoplanets.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Static cardiac imaging such as late gadolinium enhancement, mapping,\nor 3-D coronary angiography require prior information, e.g., the phase during a\ncardiac cycle with least motion, called resting phase (RP). The purpose of this\nwork is to propose a fully automated framework that allows the detection of the\nright coronary artery (RCA) RP within CINE series. Methods: The proposed\nprototype system consists of three main steps. First, the localization of the\nregions of interest (ROI) is performed. Second, as CINE series are\ntime-resolved, the cropped ROI series over all time points are taken for\ntracking motions quantitatively. Third, the output motion values are used to\nclassify RPs. In this work, we focused on the detection of the area with the\nouter edge of the cross-section of the RCA as our target. The proposed\nframework was evaluated on 102 clinically acquired dataset at 1.5T and 3T. The\nautomatically classified RPs were compared with the ground truth RPs annotated\nmanually by a medical expert for testing the robustness and feasibility of the\nframework. Results: The predicted RCA RPs showed high agreement with the\nexperts annotated RPs with 92.7% accuracy, 90.5% sensitivity and 95.0%\nspecificity for the unseen study dataset. The mean absolute difference of the\nstart and end RP was 13.6 ${\\pm}$ 18.6 ms for the validation study dataset\n(n=102).

    "abstract": "The rapid recent progress in machine learning (ML) has raised a number of\nscientific questions that challenge the longstanding dogma of the field. One of\nthe most important riddles is the good empirical generalization of\noverparameterized models. Overparameterized models are excessively complex with\nrespect to the size of the training dataset, which results in them perfectly\nfitting (i.e., interpolating) the training data, which is usually noisy. Such\ninterpolation of noisy data is traditionally associated with detrimental\noverfitting, and yet a wide range of interpolating models -- from simple linear\nmodels to deep neural networks -- have recently been observed to generalize\nextremely well on fresh test data. Indeed, the recently discovered double\ndescent phenomenon has revealed that highly overparameterized models often\nimprove over the best underparameterized model in test performance.\nUnderstanding learning in this overparameterized regime requires new theory\nand foundational empirical studies, even for the simplest case of the linear\nmodel. The underpinnings of this understanding have been laid in very recent\nanalyses of overparameterized linear regression and related statistical\nlearning tasks, which resulted in precise analytic characterizations of double\ndescent. This paper provides a succinct overview of this emerging theory of\noverparameterized ML (henceforth abbreviated as TOPML) that explains these\nrecent findings through a statistical signal processing perspective. We\nemphasize the unique aspects that define the TOPML research area as a subfield\nof modern ML theory and outline interesting open questions that remain.",

    "abstract": "Quality control (QC) of MR images is essential to ensure that downstream\nanalyses such as segmentation can be performed successfully. Currently, QC is\npredominantly performed visually and subjectively, at significant time and\noperator cost. We aim to automate the process using a probabilistic network\nthat estimates segmentation uncertainty through a heteroscedastic noise model,\nproviding a measure of task-specific quality. By augmenting training images\nwith k-space artefacts, we propose a novel CNN architecture to decouple sources\nof uncertainty related to the task and different k-space artefacts in a\nself-supervised manner. This enables the prediction of separate uncertainties\nfor different types of data degradation. While the uncertainty predictions\nreflect the presence and severity of artefacts, the network provides more\nrobust and generalisable segmentation predictions given the quality of the\ndata. We show that models trained with artefact augmentation provide\ninformative measures of uncertainty on both simulated artefacts and problematic\nreal-world images identified by human raters, both qualitatively and\nquantitatively in the form of error bars on volume measurements. Relating\nartefact uncertainty to segmentation Dice scores, we observe that our\nuncertainty predictions provide a better estimate of MRI quality from the point\nof view of the task (gray matter segmentation) compared to commonly used\nmetrics of quality including signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise\nratio (CNR), hence providing a real-time quality metric indicative of\nsegmentation quality.",

    "title": "Evaluation of Convolutional Neural Networks for COVID-19 Classification  on Chest X-Rays",
    "abstract": "Early identification of patients with COVID-19 is essential to enable\nadequate treatment and to reduce the burden on the health system. The gold\nstandard for COVID-19 detection is the use of RT-PCR tests. However, due to the\nhigh demand for tests, these can take days or even weeks in some regions of\nBrazil. Thus, an alternative for detecting COVID-19 is the analysis of Digital\nChest X-rays (XR). Changes due to COVID-19 can be detected in XR, even in\nasymptomatic patients. In this context, models based on deep learning have\ngreat potential to be used as support systems for diagnosis or as screening\ntools. In this paper, we propose the evaluation of convolutional neural\nnetworks to identify pneumonia due to COVID-19 in XR. The proposed methodology\nconsists of a preprocessing step of the XR, data augmentation, and\nclassification by the convolutional architectures DenseNet121,\nInceptionResNetV2, InceptionV3, MovileNetV2, ResNet50, and VGG16 pre-trained\nwith the ImageNet dataset. The obtained results demonstrate that the VGG16\narchitecture obtained superior performance in the classification of XR for the\nevaluation metrics using the methodology proposed in this article. The obtained\nresults for our methodology demonstrate that the VGG16 architecture presented a\nsuperior performance in the classification of XR, with an Accuracy of 85.11%,\nSensitivity of 85.25%, Specificity of $85.16%, F1-score of $85.03%, and an AUC\nof 0.9758.",

    "abstract": "Discovering causal structures from data is a challenging inference problem of\nfundamental importance in all areas of science. The appealing scaling\nproperties of neural networks have recently led to a surge of interest in\ndifferentiable neural network-based methods for learning causal structures from\ndata. So far differentiable causal discovery has focused on static datasets of\nobservational or interventional origin. In this work, we introduce an active\nintervention-targeting mechanism which enables a quick identification of the\nunderlying causal structure of the data-generating process. Our method\nsignificantly reduces the required number of interactions compared with random\nintervention targeting and is applicable for both discrete and continuous\noptimization formulations of learning the underlying directed acyclic graph\n(DAG) from data. We examine the proposed method across a wide range of settings\nand demonstrate superior performance on multiple benchmarks from simulated to\nreal-world data.",

    "abstract": "30 million Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imaging tests are issued every\nyear to diagnose various retinal diseases, but accurate diagnosis of OCT scans\nrequires trained ophthalmologists who are still prone to making\nmisclassifications. With better systems for diagnosis, many cases of vision\nloss caused by retinal disease could be entirely avoided. In this work, we\ndeveloped a CNN-based model for accurate classification of CNV, DME, Drusen,\nand Normal OCT scans. Furthermore, we placed an emphasis on producing both\nqualitative and quantitative explanations of the model's decisions. Our\nclass-weighted EfficientNet B2 classification model performed at 99.79%\naccuracy. We then produced and analyzed heatmaps of where in the OCT scan the\nmodel focused. After producing the heatmaps, we created breakdowns of the\nspecific retinal layers the model focused on. While highly accurate models have\nbeen previously developed, our work is the first to produce detailed\nexplanations of the model's decisions. The combination of accuracy and\ninterpretability in our work can be clinically applied for better patient care.\nFuture work can use a similar model for classification on larger and more\ndiverse data sets.",

Driven by a\nrecent observation that signals in Gaussian shift-invariant spaces are\ndetermined by lattice measurements [Grohs, P., Liehr, L., Injectivity of Gabor\nphase retrieval from lattice measurements, arXiv:2008.07238] we prove a\nsampling result on the stable approximation from finitely many spectrogram\nsamples.

Causal mechanisms can be described by structural causal models. In\nthis work, we propose a method for estimating bivariate structural causal\nmodels using a combination of normalising flows applied to density estimation\nand variational Gaussian process regression for post-nonlinear models. It\nfacilitates causal discovery, i.e. distinguishing cause and effect, by either\nthe independence of cause and residual or a likelihood ratio test. Our method\nwhich estimates post-nonlinear models can better explain a variety of\nreal-world cause-effect pairs than a simple additive noise model. Though it\nremains difficult to exploit this benefit regarding all pairs from the\nT\\\"ubingen benchmark database, we demonstrate that combining the additive noise\nmodel approach with our method significantly enhances causal discovery.",
