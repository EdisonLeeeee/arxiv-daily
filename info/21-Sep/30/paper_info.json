    "title": "Separating Circuits : Switching Lemmas and Random Restrictions",
    "abstract": "This was submitted as a final project for CS254B, taught by Li Yang Tan and\nTom Knowles. The field of Circuit Complexity utilises careful analysis of\nBoolean Circuit Functions in order to extract meaningful information about a\nrange of complexity classes. In particular, the complexity class $P /\n\\text{Poly}$ has played a central role in much of the historical attempts to\ntackle the problem of whether solution and verification are equivalent i.e. the\ncentral $P$ versus $NP$ problem. Whilst circuits can potentially be easier to\nanalyse than Turing Machines due to their non-uniform nature of computation\n(program size is allowed to depend on the input size), it is notoriously hard\nto establish lower bounds for them. In this report, we will touch upon several\nresults published by Hastad, Sipser and Razborov that will highlight a dynamic\ninterplay between circuit complexity and many of the central ideas of\nmodern-day complexity theory, and in particular the central importance of\nHastad's Switching Lemma.",

    "abstract": "Click-through rate (CTR) prediction becomes indispensable in ubiquitous web\nrecommendation applications. Nevertheless, the current methods are struggling\nunder the cold-start scenarios where the user interactions are extremely\nsparse. We consider this problem as an automatic identification about whether\nthe user behaviors are rich enough to capture the interests for prediction, and\npropose an Auto-Quantized Contrastive Learning (AQCL) loss to regularize the\nmodel. Different from previous methods, AQCL explores both the\ninstance-instance and the instance-cluster similarity to robustify the latent\nrepresentation, and automatically reduces the information loss to the active\nusers due to the quantization. The proposed framework is agnostic to different\nmodel architectures and can be trained in an end-to-end fashion.

    "abstract": "With smartphones' omnipresence in people's pockets, Machine Learning (ML) on\nmobile is gaining traction as devices become more powerful. With applications\nranging from visual filters to voice assistants, intelligence on mobile comes\nin many forms and facets. However, Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference remains\na compute intensive workload, with devices struggling to support intelligence\nat the cost of responsiveness.On the one hand, there is significant research on\nreducing model runtime requirements and supporting deployment on embedded\ndevices. On the other hand, the strive to maximise the accuracy of a task is\nsupported by deeper and wider neural networks, making mobile deployment of\nstate-of-the-art DNNs a moving target.\nIn this paper, we perform the first holistic study of DNN usage in the wild\nin an attempt to track deployed models and match how these run on widely\ndeployed devices. To this end, we analyse over 16k of the most popular apps in\nthe Google Play Store to characterise their DNN usage and performance across\ndevices of different capabilities, both across tiers and generations.\nSimultaneously, we measure the models' energy footprint, as a core cost\ndimension of any mobile deployment. To streamline the process, we have\ndeveloped gaugeNN, a tool that automates the deployment, measurement and\nanalysis of DNNs on devices, with support for different frameworks and\nplatforms. Results from our experience study paint the landscape of deep\nlearning deployments on smartphones and indicate their popularity across app\ndevelopers. Furthermore, our study shows the gap between bespoke techniques and\nreal-world deployments and the need for optimised deployment of deep learning\nmodels in a highly dynamic and heterogeneous ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Simulation based or dynamic probabilistic risk assessment methodologies were\nprimarily developed for proving a more realistic and complete representation of\ncomplex systems accident response. Such simulation based methodologies have\nproven to be particularly powerful for systems with control loops and complex\ninteractions between its elements, be they hardware, software, or human, as\nthey provide a natural probabilistic environment to include physical models of\nsystem behavior (e.g., coupled neutronics and thermal hydraulic codes for\nnuclear power plants), mechanistic models of materials or hardware systems to\npredict failure, and those of natural hazards. Despite the advancements in\nsimulation based methodologies, the fundamental challenge still persists as the\nspace of possible probabilistic system trajectories is nearly infinite in size\nin simulating even systems of relatively low complexity. In this paper, a\nframework is developed to identify rare and extreme events and enabling the use\nof reverse trajectories to trace failures (or other system states) to causes\nfor potential mitigation actions. This framework consists of an Intelligent\nGuidance module, Trajectory Generation module and Physical Simulation module.\nThe Intelligent Guidance module provides planning information to the Trajectory\nGeneration module that creates scenarios by interacting with the Physical\nSimulation in its environment. In turn, system trajectories or scenarios are\ncreated and post processed to provide updating information to the Intelligent\nGuidance module or aggregate the results when stopping criteria are met. The\nobjective of guided simulation is to control the growth of the scenario tree\nand to efficiently identify important scenarios that meet single or multiple\ncriteria.

    "abstract": "Automating the Key Information Extraction (KIE) from documents improves\nefficiency, productivity, and security in many industrial scenarios such as\nrapid indexing and archiving. Many existing supervised learning methods for the\nKIE task need to feed a large number of labeled samples and learn separate\nmodels for different types of documents. However, collecting and labeling a\nlarge dataset is time-consuming and is not a user-friendly requirement for many\ncloud platforms. To overcome these challenges, we propose a deep end-to-end\ntrainable network for one-shot KIE using partial graph matching. Contrary to\nprevious methods that the learning of similarity and solving are optimized\nseparately, our method enables the learning of the two processes in an\nend-to-end framework. Existing one-shot KIE methods are either template or\nsimple attention-based learning approach that struggle to handle texts that are\nshifted beyond their desired positions caused by printers, as illustrated in\nFig.1. To solve this problem, we add one-to-(at most)-one constraint such that\nwe will find the globally optimized solution even if some texts are drifted.\nFurther, we design a multimodal context ensemble block to boost the performance\nthrough fusing features of spatial, textual, and aspect representations. To\npromote research of KIE, we collected and annotated a one-shot document KIE\ndataset named DKIE with diverse types of images. The DKIE dataset consists of\n2.5K document images captured by mobile phones in natural scenes, and it is the\nlargest available one-shot KIE dataset up to now.

    "abstract": "Robots deployed in the real world over extended periods of time need to\nreason about unexpected failures, learn to predict them, and to proactively\ntake actions to avoid future failures. Existing approaches for competence-aware\nplanning are either model-based, requiring explicit enumeration of known\nfailure modes, or purely statistical, using state- and location-specific\nfailure statistics to infer competence. We instead propose a structured\nmodel-free approach to competence-aware planning by reasoning about plan\nexecution failures due to errors in perception, without requiring a-priori\nenumeration of failure modes or requiring location-specific failure statistics.\nWe introduce competence-aware path planning via introspective perception\n(CPIP), a Bayesian framework to iteratively learn and exploit task-level\ncompetence in novel deployment environments. CPIP factorizes the\ncompetence-aware planning problem into two components. First, perception errors\nare learned in a model-free and location-agnostic setting via introspective\nperception prior to deployment in novel environments. Second, during actual\ndeployments, the prediction of task-level failures is learned in a\ncontext-aware setting. Experiments in a simulation show that the proposed CPIP\napproach outperforms the frequentist baseline in multiple mobile robot tasks,\nand is further validated via real robot experiments in an environment with\nperceptually challenging obstacles and terrain.",

For given positive integer $m$, a\ncodebook is generated with up to $2^{m(m+3)/2}$ codewords of length $2^m$,\nwhere each codeword is a unique RM sequence determined by a matrix-vector pair\nwith binary entries.

    "title": "ParaLiNGAM: Parallel Causal Structure Learning for Linear non-Gaussian  Acyclic Models",
    "abstract": "One of the key objectives in many fields in machine learning is to discover\ncausal relationships among a set of variables from observational data. In\nlinear non-Gaussian acyclic models (LiNGAM), it can be shown that the true\nunderlying causal structure can be identified uniquely from merely\nobservational data. DirectLiNGAM algorithm is a well-known solution to learn\nthe true causal structure in high dimensional setting. DirectLiNGAM algorithm\nexecutes in a sequence of iterations and it performs a set of comparisons\nbetween pairs of variables in each iteration. Unfortunately, the runtime of\nthis algorithm grows significantly as the number of variables increases. In\nthis paper, we propose a parallel algorithm, called ParaLiNGAM, to learn casual\nstructures based on DirectLiNGAM algorithm. We propose a threshold mechanism\nthat can reduce the number of comparisons remarkably compared with the\nsequential solution. Moreover, in order to further reduce runtime, we employ a\nmessaging mechanism between workers and derive some mathematical formulations\nto simplify the execution of comparisons. We also present an implementation of\nParaLiNGAM on GPU, considering hardware constraints. Experimental results on\nsynthetic and real data show that the implementation of proposed algorithm on\nGPU can outperform DirectLiNGAM by a factor up to 4600 X.",

    "abstract": "Graph Convolution Networks (GCN) are used in numerous settings involving a\nlarge underlying graph as well as several layers. Standard SGD-based training\nscales poorly here since each descent step ends up updating node embeddings for\na large portion of the graph. Recent methods attempt to remedy this by\nsub-sampling the graph which does reduce the compute load, but at the cost of\nbiased gradients which may offer suboptimal performance. In this work we\nintroduce a new method IGLU that caches forward-pass embeddings for all nodes\nat various GCN layers. This enables IGLU to perform lazy updates that do not\nrequire updating a large number of node embeddings during descent which offers\nmuch faster convergence but does not significantly bias the gradients. Under\nstandard assumptions such as objective smoothness, IGLU provably converges to a\nfirst-order saddle point. We validate IGLU extensively on a variety of\nbenchmarks, where it offers up to 1.2% better accuracy despite requiring up to\n88% less wall-clock time.",

This study explores the effect of vaccine hesitancy on the\nspread of disease by introducing an SIRS-V$_\\kappa$ model, with compartments of\nsusceptible (S), infected (I), recovered (R), and vaccinated (V). We leverage\nthe concept of carrying capacity to account for vaccine hesitancy by defining a\nvaccine confidence level $\\kappa$, which is the maximum number of people that\nwill become vaccinated during the course of a disease. The inverse of vaccine\nconfidence is vaccine hesitance, $(\\frac{1}{\\kappa})$.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown their success as high-dimensional\nfunction approximators in many applications; however, training DNNs can be\nchallenging in general. DNN training is commonly phrased as a stochastic\noptimization problem whose challenges include non-convexity, non-smoothness,\ninsufficient regularization, and complicated data distributions. Hence, the\nperformance of DNNs on a given task depends crucially on tuning\nhyperparameters, especially learning rates and regularization parameters. In\nthe absence of theoretical guidelines or prior experience on similar tasks,\nthis requires solving many training problems, which can be time-consuming and\ndemanding on computational resources. This can limit the applicability of DNNs\nto problems with non-standard, complex, and scarce datasets, e.g., those\narising in many scientific applications. To remedy the challenges of DNN\ntraining, we propose slimTrain, a stochastic optimization method for training\nDNNs with reduced sensitivity to the choice hyperparameters and fast initial\nconvergence. The central idea of slimTrain is to exploit the separability\ninherent in many DNN architectures; that is, we separate the DNN into a\nnonlinear feature extractor followed by a linear model. This separability\nallows us to leverage recent advances made for solving large-scale, linear,\nill-posed inverse problems. Crucially, for the linear weights, slimTrain does\nnot require a learning rate and automatically adapts the regularization\nparameter. Since our method operates on mini-batches, its computational\noverhead per iteration is modest. In our numerical experiments, slimTrain\noutperforms existing DNN training methods with the recommended hyperparameter\nsettings and reduces the sensitivity of DNN training to the remaining\nhyperparameters.",

To\nthis end, this paper proposes nine probing datasets organized by the type of\n\\emph{controllable} text perturbation for three Indo-European languages with a\nvarying degree of word order flexibility: English, Swedish and Russian. Based\non the probing analysis of the M-BERT and M-BART models, we report that the\nsyntactic sensitivity depends on the language and model pre-training\nobjectives.

Network members are often under pressure from incoming\ninformation with different sources, such as informative campaigns for\nincreasing awareness, viral marketing, rumours, fake news, or the results of\nother activities. Messages are often repeated, and such repetition can improve\nperformance in the form of cumulative influence. Repeated messages may also be\nignored due to a limited ability to process information. Learning processes are\nleading to the repeated messages being ignored, as their content has already\nbeen absorbed. In such cases, responsiveness decreases with repetition, and the\nhabituation effect can be observed. Here, we analyse spreading processes while\nconsidering the habituation effect and performance drop along with an increased\nnumber of contacts. The the ability to recover when reducing the number of\nmessages is also considered. The results show that even low habituation and a\ndecrease in propagation probability may substantially impact network coverage.\nThis can lead to a significant reduction in the potential for a seed set\nselected with an influence maximisation method. Apart from the impact of the\nhabituation effect on spreading processes, we show how it can be reduced with\nthe use of the sequential seeding approach. This shows that sequential seeding\nis less sensitive to the habituation effect than single-stage seeding, and that\nit can be used to limit the negative impact on users overloaded with incoming\nmessages.",

    "abstract": "Status update systems consist of sensors that take measurements of a physical\nparameter and transmit them to a remote receiver. Age of Information (AoI) has\nbeen studied extensively as a metric for the freshness of information in such\nsystems with and without an enforced hard or soft deadline. In this paper, we\npropose three metrics for status update systems to measure the ability of\ndifferent queuing systems to meet a threshold requirement for the AoI. The {\\em\noverage probability} is defined as the probability that the age of the most\nrecent update packet held by the receiver is larger than the threshold. The\n{\\em stale update probability} is the probability that an update is stale,\ni.e., its age has exceeded the deadline, when it is delivered to the receiver.\nFinally, the {\\em average overage} is defined as the time average of the\noverage (i.e., age beyond the threshold), and is a measure of the average\n``staleness'' of the update packets held by the receiver. We investigate these\nmetrics in three typical status update queuing systems -- M/G/1/1, M/G/1/$2^*$,\nand M/M/1. Numerical results show the performances for these metrics under\ndifferent parameter settings and different service distributions. The\ndifferences between the average overage and average AoI are also shown. Our\nresults demonstrate that a lower bound exists for the stale update probability\nwhen the buffer size is limited. Further, we observe that the overage\nprobability decreases and the stale update probability increases as the update\narrival rate increases.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic geometry (SG) has been successfully used as a modelling tool for\ncellular networks to characterize the coverage probability in both the downlink\n(DL) and uplink (UL) systems, under the assumption that the base stations (BS)\nare deployed as a Poisson point process. In the present article, we extend this\nuse and provide further results for interference limited and Rayleigh fading\nnetworks, culminating in a multifaceted contribution. First, we compactly model\nthe two systems at once, allowing parallels to be drawn and contrast to be\ncreated. Also, for DL we manage to obtain two closed form expressions for two\nspecial cases. Moreover, for UL, notorious for being difficult, we develop a\nclever approximation that overcomes the difficulty, yielding excellent results.\nAdditionally, we present two efficient Monte Carlo simulation algorithms,\ndesigned primarily to validate the models, but can be of great use for SG\nmodelling of communications systems in general. Finally, we prove two theorems\nat odds with popular belief in cellular communications research. Specifically,\nwe prove that under the SG model, the coverage probability in both DL and UL is\nindependent of BS density. Based on this revelation, a plethora of results in\nthe literature have to be re-examined to rid them of a parameter that has been\nproven superfluous.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a method to generate Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM)\ncarrying vortex waves inside a metallic circular waveguide (CW). These waves\nfeature ability to carry multiple orthogonal modes at the same frequency, by\nthe virtue of their unique spatial structure. In essence high data rate\nchannels can be developed using such waves. In free space, OAM carrying vortex\nwaves has beam divergence issues and a central NULL, which makes the waves\nunfavourable for free space communication. But, OAM modes in guided structures\ndo not suffer from these drawbacks. This prospect of enhancement of\ncommunication spectrum provides the background for the study of vortex wave in\nthe circular waveguides. In this work, a radial array of monopoles is designed\nto generate the vortex wave inside the waveguide. Further, we introduced the\ndielectric materials inside the waveguide in order to manipulate the operating\nfrequency of the OAM modes. Simulation results shows that the various\ndielectric materials allow us to tune the working frequency of the OAM beam to\na desired frequency.",

These cameras can detect\nobjects that are outside the line of sight of the autonomous vehicles (AV) and\nsend that information to AVs using V2X technology. However, in order for this\ninformation to be of any use to the AV, the detected objects should be provided\nin the reference frame of the prior map that the AV uses for its own\nnavigation. Therefore, it is important to know the accurate pose of the\ninfrastructure camera with respect to the prior map.

An efficient method for the\ntreatment of singularities in the linear PBE was introduced in\n\\cite{BeKKKS:18}, that is based on the RS tensor decomposition for both\nelectrostatic potential and the discretized Dirac delta distribution. In this\npaper, we extend this regularization method to the nonlinear PBE.

In this paper, we consider the recovery of a\n$k$-bandlimited graph signal that is an initial signal of a heat diffusion\nprocess from its space-time samples. We propose three random space-time\nsampling regimes, termed dynamical sampling techniques, that consist in\nselecting a small subset of space-time nodes at random according to some\nprobability distribution. We show that the number of space-time samples\nrequired to ensure stable recovery for each regime depends on a parameter\ncalled the spectral graph weighted coherence, that depends on the interplay\nbetween the dynamics over the graphs and sampling probability distributions. In\noptimal scenarios, no more than $\\mathcal{O}(k \\log(k))$ space-time samples are\nsufficient to ensure accurate and stable recovery of all $k$-bandlimited\nsignals. In any case, dynamical sampling typically requires much fewer spatial\nsamples than the static case by leveraging the temporal information. Then, we\npropose a computationally efficient method to reconstruct $k$-bandlimited\nsignals from their space-time samples.

To date, QRA has mostly focused on\ntechnical barriers, despite many accidents having human failure as a primary\ncause or a contributing factor. Human Reliability Analysis (HRA) allows for the\nassessment of the human contribution to risk to be assessed both qualitatively\nand quantitatively. Most credible and highly advanced HRA methods have largely\nbeen developed and applied in support of nuclear power plants control room\noperations and in context of probabilistic risk analysis. Moreover, many of the\nHRA methods have issues that have led to inconsistencies, insufficient\ntraceability and reproducibility in both the qualitative and quantitative\nphases.

Furthermore, it is fundamental to\nassess these methods against good practices of HRA and the requirements for\nadvanced HRA methods. The present paper accomplishes this by analyzing seven\nHRA methods. The evaluation of the methods was performed in three stages. The\nfirst stage consisted of an evaluation of the degree of adaptability of the\nmethod for the Oil and Gas industry. In the second stage the methods were\nevaluated against desirable items in an HRA method.

In addition to the methods' evaluation, this paper presents an\noverview of state-of-the-art discussions on HRA, led by the Nuclear industry\ncommunity.

Based on this model we define two computational problems: data\ncleaning and probabilistic query answering and study for both of them their\ncorresponding complexity when considering that the transformation of the\ndatabase can be caused by either removing (subset) or adding (superset) nodes\nand edges.",

The key characteristic of parametric CAD is that design\nintent is encoded not only via geometric primitives, but also by parameterized\nconstraints between the elements. This relational specification can be viewed\nas the construction of a constraint program, allowing edits to coherently\npropagate to other parts of the design. Machine learning offers the intriguing\npossibility of accelerating the design process via generative modeling of these\nstructures, enabling new tools such as autocompletion, constraint inference,\nand conditional synthesis. In this work, we present such an approach to\ngenerative modeling of parametric CAD sketches, which constitute the basic\ncomputational building blocks of modern mechanical design. Our model, trained\non real-world designs from the SketchGraphs dataset, autoregressively\nsynthesizes sketches as sequences of primitives, with initial coordinates, and\nconstraints that reference back to the sampled primitives. As samples from the\nmodel match the constraint graph representation used in standard CAD software,\nthey may be directly imported, solved, and edited according to downstream\ndesign tasks. In addition, we condition the model on various contexts,\nincluding partial sketches (primers) and images of hand-drawn sketches.\nEvaluation of the proposed approach demonstrates its ability to synthesize\nrealistic CAD sketches and its potential to aid the mechanical design workflow.",

Recent advances in\nusing data-driven approaches have achieved significant improvements in terms of\nprediction accuracy. However, the lack of group-aware analysis has limited the\nperformance of forecasting models. This is especially apparent in highly\npopulated scenes, where pedestrians are moving in groups and the interactions\nbetween groups are extremely complex and dynamic. In this paper, we present\nGrouptron, a multi-scale dynamic forecasting framework that leverages\npedestrian group detection and utilizes individual-level, group-level, and\nscene-level information for better understanding and representation of the\nscenes. Our approach employs spatio-temporal clustering algorithms to identify\npedestrian groups, creates spatio-temporal graphs at the individual, group, and\nscene levels. It then uses graph neural networks to encode dynamics at\ndifferent scales and incorporates encoding across different scales for\ntrajectory prediction. We carried out extensive comparisons and ablation\nexperiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our method\nachieves 9.3% decrease in final displacement error (FDE) compared with\nstate-of-the-art methods on ETH/UCY benchmark datasets, and 16.1% decrease in\nFDE in more crowded scenes where extensive human group interactions are more\nfrequently present.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of computing all Pareto-optimal journeys in a public\ntransit network regarding the two criteria of arrival time and number of\ntransfers taken. In recent years, great advances have been made in making\npublic transit network routing more scalable to larger networks. However, most\napproaches are silent on scalability in another dimension: Time. Experimental\nevaluations are often done on slices of timetables spanning a couple of days,\nwhen in reality, the planning horizon is much longer. We introduce an extension\nto trip-based public transit routing, proposed in [12], that allows efficient\nhandling of arbitrarily long timetables. Our experimental evaluation shows that\nthe resulting algorithm achieves fast queries on year-spanning timetables, and\ncan incorporate updates such as delays or changed routes quickly even on large\nnetworks.",

    "abstract": "Disease progression modeling (DPM) involves using mathematical frameworks to\nquantitatively measure the severity of how certain disease progresses. DPM is\nuseful in many ways such as predicting health state, categorizing disease\nstages, and assessing patients disease trajectory etc. Recently, with wider\navailability of electronic health records (EHR) and the broad application of\ndata-driven machine learning method, DPM has attracted much attention yet\nremains two major challenges: (i) Due to the existence of irregularity,\nheterogeneity and long-term dependency in EHRs, most existing DPM methods might\nnot be able to provide comprehensive patient representations. (ii) Lots of\nrecords in EHRs might be irrelevant to the target disease. Most existing models\nlearn to automatically focus on the relevant information instead of explicitly\ncapture the target-relevant events, which might make the learned model\nsuboptimal. To address these two issues, we propose Temporal Clustering with\nExternal Memory Network (TC-EMNet) for DPM that groups patients with similar\ntrajectories to form disease clusters/stages. TC-EMNet uses a variational\nautoencoder (VAE) to capture internal complexity from the input data and\nutilizes an external memory work to capture long term distance information,\nboth of which are helpful for producing comprehensive patient states. Last but\nnot least, k-means algorithm is adopted to cluster the extracted comprehensive\npatient states to capture disease progression. Experiments on two real-world\ndatasets show that our model demonstrates competitive clustering performance\nagainst state-of-the-art methods and is able to identify clinically meaningful\nclusters. The visualization of the extracted patient states shows that the\nproposed model can generate better patient states than the baselines.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has had a far reaching impact in robotics. Specifically, deep\nreinforcement learning algorithms have been highly effective in synthesizing\nneural-network controllers for a wide range of tasks. However, despite this\nempirical success, these controllers still lack theoretical guarantees on their\nperformance, such as Lyapunov stability (i.e., all trajectories of the\nclosed-loop system are guaranteed to converge to a goal state under the control\npolicy). This is in stark contrast to traditional model-based controller\ndesign, where principled approaches (like LQR) can synthesize stable\ncontrollers with provable guarantees. To address this gap, we propose a generic\nmethod to synthesize a Lyapunov-stable neural-network controller, together with\na neural-network Lyapunov function to simultaneously certify its stability. Our\napproach formulates the Lyapunov condition verification as a mixed-integer\nlinear program (MIP). Our MIP verifier either certifies the Lyapunov condition,\nor generates counter examples that can help improve the candidate controller\nand the Lyapunov function. We also present an optimization program to compute\nan inner approximation of the region of attraction for the closed-loop system.\nWe apply our approach to robots including an inverted pendulum, a 2D and a 3D\nquadrotor, and showcase that our neural-network controller outperforms a\nbaseline LQR controller.

Specifically, we first\ndevelop one behavior policy and use it to traverse the feature set and generate\ntraining data. And then, we evaluate the target policy based on the training\ndata and improve the target policy by Bellman equation. Besides, we conduct the\nimportance sampling in an incremental way, and propose an early stopping\nstrategy to improve the training efficiency by the removal of skew data. In the\nearly stopping strategy, the behavior policy stops traversing with a\nprobability inversely proportional to the importance sampling weight.

    "abstract": "Digitalization is changing how people visit museums and explore the artifacts\nthey house. Museums, as important educational venues outside classrooms, need\nto actively explore the application of digital interactive media, including\ngames that can balance entertainment and knowledge acquisition. In this paper,\nwe introduce RelicVR, a virtual reality (VR) game that encourages players to\ndiscover artifacts through physical interaction in a game-based approach.\nPlayers need to unearth artifacts hidden in a clod enclosure by using available\ntools and physical movements. The game relies on the dynamic voxel deformation\ntechnique to allow players to chip away earth covering the artifacts. We added\nuncertainty in the exploration process to bring it closer to how archaeological\ndiscovery happens in real life. Players do not know the shape or features of\nthe hidden artifact and have to take away the earth gradually but strategically\nwithout hitting the artifact itself. From playtesting sessions with eight\nparticipants, we found that the uncertainty elements are conducive to their\nengagement and exploration experience. Overall, RelicVR is an innovative game\nthat can improve players' learning motivation and outcomes of ancient\nartifacts.",

However, scholars have noted a\ntrend in data flow and collection; and have alleged mass surveillance and\ndigital supremacy. To this end therefore, nations of the world such as Russia,\nChina, Germany, Canada, France and Brazil among others have taken steps toward\nchanging the narrative. The question now is, should Africans join these giants\nin this school of thought on digital sovereignty or fold their hands to remain\non the other side of the divide? This question among others are the main\nreasons that provoked the thoughts of putting this paper together. This is with\na view to demystifying the strategies to reconfigure data infrastructure in the\ncontext of Africa. It also highlights the benefits of digital technologies and\nits propensity to foster all round development in the continent as it relates\nto economic face-lift, employment creation, national security, among others.\nThere is therefore a need for African nations to design appropriate blueprint\nto ensure security of her digital infrastructure and the flow of data within\nher cyber space. In addition, a roadmap in the immediate, short- and long-term\nin accordance with the framework of African developmental goals should be put\nin place to guide the implementation.",

There are plenty of research\nprototypes and industrial deployments of causally consistent distributed\nsystems. However, as far as we know, none of them consider Byzantine faults,\nexcept Byz-RCM proposed by Tseng et al. Byz-RCM achieves causal consistency in\nthe client-server model with $3f + 1$ servers where up to $f$ servers may\nsuffer Byzantine faults, but assumes that clients are non-Byzantine. In this\nwork, we present Byz-Gentlerain, the first causal consistency protocol which\ntolerates up to $f$ Byzantine servers among $3f + 1$ servers in each partition\nand any number of Byzantine clients. Byz-GentleRain is inspired by the\nstabilization mechanism of GentleRain for causal consistency. To prevent causal\nviolations due to Byzantine faults, Byz-GentleRain relies on PBFT to reach\nagreement on a sequence of global stable times and updates among servers, and\nonly updates with timestamps less than or equal to such common global stable\ntimes are visible to clients. We prove that Byz-GentleRain achieves Byz-CC, the\ncausal consistency variant in the presence of Byzantine faults. We evaluate\nByz-GentleRain on Aliyun.

In this paper, we try to reveal the influence of the\nbinomial crossover by performing a theoretical comparison between the $(1+1)EA$\nand its variants, the $(1+1)EA_{C}$ and the $(1+1)EA_{CM}$. Generally, the\nintroduction of the binomial crossover contributes to the enhancement of the\nexploration ability as well as degradation of the exploitation ability, and\nunder some conditions, leads to the dominance of the transition matrix for\nbinary optimization problems. As a result, both the $(1+1)EA_{C}$ and the\n$(1+1)EA_{CM}$ outperform the $(1+1)EA$ on the unimodal OneMax problem, but do\nnot always dominate it on the Deceptive problem. Finally, we perform\nexploration analysis by investigating probabilities to transfer from\nnon-optimal statuses to the optimal status of the Deceptive problem, inspired\nby which adaptive strategies are proposed to improve the ability of global\nexploration. It suggests that incorporation of the binomial crossover could be\na feasible strategy to improve the performances of randomized search\nheuristics.",

Since last many years there are many tools and\ntechniques that have been developed to support the writing of language script.\nMost of the Asian languages like Arabic, Urdu, Persian, Chains and Korean are\nwritten in Roman alphabets. Roman alphabets are the most commonly used for\ntransliteration of languages, which have non-Latin scripts. For writing Urdu\ncharacters as an input, there are many layouts which are already exist. Mostly\nUrdu speaker prefer to use Roman-Urdu for different applications, because\nmostly user is not familiar with Urdu language keyboard.

The algorithm work like, convert the encoding roman\nwords into the words in the standard Urdu script and match it with the lexicon.\nIf match found, then display the word in the text editor. The highest frequency\nwords are displayed if more than one match found in the lexicon. Display the\nfirst encoded and converted instance and set it to the default if there is not\na single instance of the match is found and then adjust the given ambiguous\nword to their desire location according to their context.

Second, dialogues are often informal structures, wherein\ndifferent individuals express personal perspectives, unlike text summarization,\ntasks that usually target formal documents such as news articles. To address\nthese issues, we focused on the association between utterances from individual\nspeakers and unique syntactic structures. Speakers have unique textual styles\nthat can contain linguistic information, such as voiceprint. Therefore, we\nconstructed a syntax-aware model by leveraging linguistic information (i.e.,\nPOS tagging), which alleviates the above issues by inherently distinguishing\nsentences uttered from individual speakers. We employed multi-task learning of\nboth syntax-aware information and dialogue summarization. To the best of our\nknowledge, our approach is the first method to apply multi-task learning to the\ndialogue summarization task.

We also develop an efficient\ndecoding algorithm that combines pipeline decoding and layered scheduling for\nthe decoding of SCPLDPCH- CCs. To estimate the decoding thresholds of\nSC-PLDPCH-CCs, we first propose a layered protograph extrinsic information\ntransfer (PEXIT) algorithm to evaluate the thresholds of spatially coupled\nPLDPC-Hadamard terminated codes (SC-PLDPCH-TDCs) with a moderate coupling\nlength. With the use of the proposed layered PEXIT method, we develop a genetic\nalgorithm to look for good SC-PLDPCH-TDCs in a systematic way. Subsequently, we\nextend the coupling length of these SC-PLDPCH-TDCs with good thresholds to form\ngood SC-PLDPCH-CCs. Based on the same set of split protomatrices, we regard the\nthreshold of SC-PLDPCH-TDC as the proxy of SC-PLDPCH-CC when the SC-PLDPCH-TDC\nwith long coupling length has almost the same code rate as the SC-PLDPCH-CC.\nResults show that our optimized SC-PLDPCH-CCs can achieve comparable thresholds\nto the block code counterparts.

On the theory side, however, despite the existence of theoretical\nresults showing the efficiency of Adam-type methods in minimization problems,\nthe reason of their wonderful performance still remains absent in GAN's\ntraining. In existing works, the fast convergence has long been considered as\none of the most important reasons and multiple works have been proposed to give\na theoretical guarantee of the convergence to a critical point of min-max\noptimization algorithms under certain assumptions. In this paper, we firstly\nargue empirically that in GAN's training, Adam does not converge to a critical\npoint even upon successful training: Only the generator is converging while the\ndiscriminator's gradient norm remains high throughout the training. We name\nthis one-sided convergence. Then we bridge the gap between experiments and\ntheory by showing that Adam-type algorithms provably converge to a one-sided\nfirst order stationary points in min-max optimization problems under the\none-sided MVI condition. We also empirically verify that such one-sided MVI\ncondition is satisfied for standard GANs after trained over standard data sets.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the very first result which provides an\nempirical observation and a strict theoretical guarantee on the one-sided\nconvergence of Adam-type algorithms in min-max optimization.",

However, existing neural network-based\ninference procedures fail to take advantage of this inductive bias. In this\npaper, we precisely characterize these isomorphic properties of factor graphs\nand propose two inference models: Factor-Equivariant Neural Belief Propagation\n(FE-NBP) and Factor-Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (FE-GNN). FE-NBP is a\nneural network that generalizes BP and respects each of the above properties of\nfactor graphs while FE-GNN is an expressive GNN model that relaxes an\nisomorphic property in favor of greater expressivity. Empirically, we\ndemonstrate on both real-world and synthetic datasets, for both marginal\ninference and MAP inference, that FE-NBP and FE-GNN together cover a range of\nsample complexity regimes: FE-NBP achieves state-of-the-art performance on\nsmall datasets while FE-GNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on large\ndatasets.",

It can be applied to any aggregation-based\napproaches, including algorithms for training a global model, as well as\npersonalized FL frameworks. Model aggregation needs to also be resilient to\nlikely user dropouts in FL system, making its design substantially more\ncomplex. State-of-the-art secure aggregation protocols essentially rely on\nsecret sharing of the random-seeds that are used for mask generations at the\nusers, in order to enable the reconstruction and cancellation of those\nbelonging to dropped users. The complexity of such approaches, however, grows\nsubstantially with the number of dropped users. We propose a new approach,\nnamed LightSecAgg, to overcome this bottleneck by turning the focus from\n\"random-seed reconstruction of the dropped users\" to \"one-shot aggregate-mask\nreconstruction of the active users\". More specifically, in LightSecAgg each\nuser protects its local model by generating a single random mask. This mask is\nthen encoded and shared to other users, in such a way that the aggregate-mask\nof any sufficiently large set of active users can be reconstructed directly at\nthe server via encoded masks. We show that LightSecAgg achieves the same\nprivacy and dropout-resiliency guarantees as the state-of-the-art protocols,\nwhile significantly reducing the overhead for resiliency to dropped users.\nFurthermore, our system optimization helps to hide the runtime cost of offline\nprocessing by parallelizing it with model training. We evaluate LightSecAgg via\nextensive experiments for training diverse models on various datasets in a\nrealistic FL system, and demonstrate that LightSecAgg significantly reduces the\ntotal training time, achieving a performance gain of up to $12.7\\times$ over\nbaselines.",

    "abstract": "Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are brain-inspired models that enable\nenergy-efficient implementation on neuromorphic hardware. However, the\nsupervised training of SNNs remains a hard problem due to the discontinuity of\nthe spiking neuron model. Most existing methods imitate the backpropagation\nframework and feedforward architectures for artificial neural networks, and use\nsurrogate derivatives or compute gradients with respect to the spiking time to\ndeal with the problem. These approaches either accumulate approximation errors\nor only propagate information limitedly through existing spikes, and usually\nrequire information propagation along time steps with large memory costs and\nbiological implausibility. In this work, we consider feedback spiking neural\nnetworks, which are more brain-like, and propose a novel training method that\ndoes not rely on the exact reverse of the forward computation. First, we show\nthat the average firing rates of SNNs with feedback connections would gradually\nevolve to an equilibrium state along time, which follows a fixed-point\nequation. Then by viewing the forward computation of feedback SNNs as a\nblack-box solver for this equation, and leveraging the implicit differentiation\non the equation, we can compute the gradient for parameters without considering\nthe exact forward procedure. In this way, the forward and backward procedures\nare decoupled and therefore the problem of non-differentiable spiking functions\nis avoided. We also briefly discuss the biological plausibility of implicit\ndifferentiation, which only requires computing another equilibrium. Extensive\nexperiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, N-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100\ndemonstrate the superior performance of our method for feedback models with\nfewer neurons and parameters in a small number of time steps.

In this work, we notice that\ntraffic flow has a high correlation with road network, which was either\ncompletely ignored or simply treated as an external factor in previous works.\nTo facilitate this problem, we propose a novel Road-Aware Traffic Flow\nMagnifier (RATFM) that explicitly exploits the prior knowledge of road networks\nto fully learn the road-aware spatial distribution of fine-grained traffic\nflow. Specifically, a multi-directional 1D convolutional layer is first\nintroduced to extract the semantic feature of the road network.

    "abstract": "This paper discusses a data-driven, empirically-based framework to make\nalgorithmic decisions or recommendations without expert knowledge. We improve\nthe performance of two algorithmic case studies: the selection of a pivot rule\nfor the Simplex method and the selection of an all-pair shortest paths\nalgorithm. We train machine learning methods to select the optimal algorithm\nfor given data without human expert opinion. We use two types of techniques,\nneural networks and boosted decision trees. We concluded, based on our\nexperiments, that:\n1) Our selection framework recommends various pivot rules that improve\noverall total performance over just using a fixed default pivot rule.\nOver many years experts identified steepest-edge pivot rule as a favorite\npivot rule. Our data analysis corroborates that the number of iterations by\nsteepest-edge is no more than 4 percent more than the optimal selection which\ncorroborates human expert knowledge, but this time the knowledge was obtained\nusing machine learning. Here our recommendation system is best when using\ngradient boosted trees.\n2) For the all-pairs shortest path problem, the models trained made a large\nimprovement and our selection is on average .07 percent away from the optimal\nchoice. The conclusions do not seem to be affected by the machine learning\nmethod we used.\nWe tried to make a parallel analysis of both algorithmic problems, but it is\nclear that there are intrinsic differences. For example, in the all-pairs\nshortest path problem the graph density is a reasonable predictor, but there is\nno analogous single parameter for decisions in the Simplex method.",

    "abstract": "Explanation techniques that synthesize small, interpretable changes to a\ngiven image while producing desired changes in the model prediction have become\npopular for introspecting black-box models. Commonly referred to as\ncounterfactuals, the synthesized explanations are required to contain\ndiscernible changes (for easy interpretability) while also being realistic\n(consistency to the data manifold). In this paper, we focus on the case where\nwe have access only to the trained deep classifier and not the actual training\ndata. While the problem of inverting deep models to synthesize images from the\ntraining distribution has been explored, our goal is to develop a deep\ninversion approach to generate counterfactual explanations for a given query\nimage. Despite their effectiveness in conditional image synthesis, we show that\nexisting deep inversion methods are insufficient for producing meaningful\ncounterfactuals. We propose DISC (Deep Inversion for Synthesizing\nCounterfactuals) that improves upon deep inversion by utilizing (a) stronger\nimage priors, (b) incorporating a novel manifold consistency objective and (c)\nadopting a progressive optimization strategy. We find that, in addition to\nproducing visually meaningful explanations, the counterfactuals from DISC are\neffective at learning classifier decision boundaries and are robust to unknown\ntest-time corruptions.",

Previous studies\nsuggest that many modern neural networks are over-confident on the predictions,\nhowever, surprisingly, we discover that GNNs are primarily in the opposite\ndirection, i.e., GNNs are under-confident. Therefore, the confidence\ncalibration for GNNs is highly desired. In this paper, we propose a novel\ntrustworthy GNN model by designing a topology-aware post-hoc calibration\nfunction. Specifically, we first verify that the confidence distribution in a\ngraph has homophily property, and this finding inspires us to design a\ncalibration GNN model (CaGCN) to learn the calibration function. CaGCN is able\nto obtain a unique transformation from logits of GNNs to the calibrated\nconfidence for each node, meanwhile, such transformation is able to preserve\nthe order between classes, satisfying the accuracy-preserving property.\nMoreover, we apply the calibration GNN to self-training framework, showing that\nmore trustworthy pseudo labels can be obtained with the calibrated confidence\nand further improve the performance.

    "abstract": "For nearly three decades, spatial games have produced a wealth of insights to\nthe study of behavior and its relation to population structure. However, as\ndifferent rules and factors are added or altered, the dynamics of spatial\nmodels often become increasingly complicated to interpret. To tackle this\nproblem, we introduce persistent homology as a rigorous framework that can be\nused to both define and compute higher-order features of data in a manner which\nis invariant to parameter choices, robust to noise, and independent of human\nobservation. Our work demonstrates its relevance for spatial games by showing\nhow topological features of simulation data that persist over different spatial\nscales reflect the stability of strategies in 2D lattice games. To do so, we\nanalyze the persistent homology of scenarios from two games: a Prisoner's\nDilemma and a SIRS epidemic model. The experimental results show how the method\naccurately detects features that correspond to real aspects of the game\ndynamics. Unlike other tools that study dynamics of spatial systems, persistent\nhomology can tell us something meaningful about population structure while\nremaining neutral about the underlying structure itself. Regardless of game\ncomplexity, since strategies either succeed or fail to conform to shapes of a\ncertain topology there is much potential for the method to provide novel\ninsights for a wide variety of spatially extended systems in biology, social\nscience, and physics.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, targeted attacks like Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) has become\none of the major concern of many enterprise networks. As a common approach to\ncounter these attacks, security staff deploy a variety of security and\nnon-security sensors at different lines of defense (Network, Host, and\nApplication) to track the attacker's behaviors during their kill chain.\nHowever, one of the drawbacks of this approach is the huge amount of events\nraised by heterogeneous security and non-security sensors which makes it\ndifficult to analyze logged events for later processing i.e. event correlation\nfor timely detection of APT attacks. Till now, some research papers have been\npublished on event aggregation for reducing the volume of logged low-level\nevents. However, most research works have been provided a method to aggregate\nthe events of a single-type and homogeneous event source i.e. NIDS. In\naddition, their main focus is only on the degree to which the event volume is\nreduced, while the amount of security information lost during the event\naggregation process is also very important. In this paper, we propose a\nthree-phase event aggregation method to reduce the volume of logged\nheterogeneous events during APT attacks considering the lowest rate of loss of\nsecurity information. To this aim, at first, low-level events of the sensors\nare clustered into some similar event groups and then, after filtering noisy\nevent clusters, the remained clusters are summarized based on an\nAttribute-Oriented Induction (AOI) method in a controllable manner to reduce\nthe unimportant or duplicated events. The method has been evaluated on the\nthree publicly available datasets: SotM34, Bryant, and LANL. The experimental\nresults show that the method is efficient enough in event aggregation and can\nreduce events volume up to 99.7\\% with an acceptable level of information loss\nratio (ILR).",

These models are designed to fit within the limited area and\nenergy constraints of the edge computing platforms, each targeting various\napplications (e.g., face detection, speech recognition, translation, image\ncaptioning, video analytics). To understand how edge ML accelerators perform,\nwe characterize the performance of a commercial Google Edge TPU, using 24\nGoogle edge NN models (which span a wide range of NN model types) and analyzing\neach NN layer within each model. We find that the Edge TPU suffers from three\nmajor shortcomings: (1) it operates significantly below peak computational\nthroughput, (2) it operates significantly below its theoretical energy\nefficiency, and (3) its memory system is a large energy and performance\nbottleneck. Our characterization reveals that the one-size-fits-all, monolithic\ndesign of the Edge TPU ignores the high degree of heterogeneity both across\ndifferent NN models and across different NN layers within the same NN model,\nleading to the shortcomings we observe.\nWe propose a new acceleration framework called Mensa. Mensa incorporates\nmultiple heterogeneous edge ML accelerators (including both on-chip and\nnear-data accelerators), each of which caters to the characteristics of a\nparticular subset of NN models and layers. During NN inference, for each NN\nlayer, Mensa decides which accelerator to schedule the layer on, taking into\naccount both the optimality of each accelerator for the layer and\nlayer-to-layer communication costs.

We design our\nsafety-aware reinforcement learning by storing all the history of \"recovery\"\nactions that rescue the agent from dangerous situations into a separate\n\"safety\" buffer and finding the best recovery action when the agent encounters\nsimilar states. Because this functionality requires the algorithm to query\nsimilar states, we implement the proposed safety mechanism using an\nunsupervised learning algorithm, k-means clustering. We evaluate the proposed\nalgorithm on six robotic control tasks that cover navigation and manipulation.\nOur results show that the proposed safety RL algorithm can achieve higher\nrewards compared with multiple baselines in both discrete and continuous\ncontrol problems.

    "abstract": "Crash localization, an important step in debugging crashes, is challenging\nwhen dealing with an extremely large number of diverse applications and\nplatforms and underlying root causes. Large-scale error reporting systems,\ne.g., Windows Error Reporting (WER), commonly rely on manually developed rules\nand heuristics to localize blamed frames causing the crashes. As new\napplications and features are routinely introduced and existing applications\nare run under new environments, developing new rules and maintaining existing\nones become extremely challenging. We propose a data-driven solution to address\nthe problem. We start with the first large-scale empirical study of 362K\ncrashes and their blamed methods reported to WER by tens of thousands of\napplications running in the field. The analysis provides valuable insights on\nwhere and how the crashes happen and what methods to blame for the crashes.\nThese insights enable us to develop DeepAnalyze, a novel multi-task sequence\nlabeling approach for identifying blamed frames in stack traces. We evaluate\nour model with over a million real-world crashes from four popular Microsoft\napplications and show that DeepAnalyze, trained with crashes from one set of\napplications, not only accurately localizes crashes of the same applications,\nbut also bootstraps crash localization for other applications with zero to very\nlittle additional training data.",

    "abstract": "Graph-level representation learning is the pivotal step for downstream tasks\nthat operate on the whole graph. The most common approach to this problem\nheretofore is graph pooling, where node features are typically averaged or\nsummed to obtain the graph representations. However, pooling operations like\naveraging or summing inevitably cause massive information missing, which may\nseverely downgrade the final performance. In this paper, we argue what is\ncrucial to graph-level downstream tasks includes not only the topological\nstructure but also the distribution from which nodes are sampled. Therefore,\npowered by existing Graph Neural Networks (GNN), we propose a new plug-and-play\npooling module, termed as Distribution Knowledge Embedding (DKEPool), where\ngraphs are rephrased as distributions on top of GNNs and the pooling goal is to\nsummarize the entire distribution information instead of retaining a certain\nfeature vector by simple predefined pooling operations. A DKEPool network de\nfacto disassembles representation learning into two stages, structure learning\nand distribution learning. Structure learning follows a recursive neighborhood\naggregation scheme to update node features where structure information is\nobtained. Distribution learning, on the other hand, omits node interconnections\nand focuses more on the distribution depicted by all the nodes. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed DKEPool significantly and\nconsistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",

In this regard, we aim to understand the\nrelationship between induced algorithmic fairness and its perception in humans.\nIn particular, we are interested in whether these two are positively correlated\nand reflect substantive fairness.

To\nunderstand this, we perform a user study to simulate candidate shortlisting by\nintroduced (manipulating mathematical) fairness in a human resource recruitment\nsetting. Our experimental results demonstrate that different levels of\nintroduced fairness are positively related to human perception of fairness, and\nsimultaneously it is also positively related to user trust in algorithmic\ndecision making.

    "abstract": "Analytical database systems are typically designed to use a column-first data\nlayout that maps better to analytical queries of access patterns. This choice\nis premised on the assumption that storing data in a row-first format leads to\naccessing unwanted fields; moreover, transforming rows to columns at runtime is\nexpensive. On the other hand, new data items are constantly ingested in\nrow-first form and transformed in the background to columns to facilitate\nfuture analytical queries. How will this design change if we can always access\nonly the desired set of columns? In this paper, to address this question, we\npresent a radically new approach to data transformation from rows to columns.\nWe build upon recent advancements in commercial embedded platforms with\ntightly-coupled re-programmable logic to design native in-memory access on rows\nand columns. We propose a new database management system (DBMS) architecture\nthat is the first hardware/software co-design. It relies on an FPGA-based\naccelerator to transparently transform base data to any group of columns with\nminimal overhead at runtime. This design allows the DBMS to access any group of\ncolumns as if it already exists in memory. Our method, termed relational\nmemory, currently implements projection, and offers the groundwork for\nimplementing selection, group by, aggregation, and supporting joins in\nhardware, thus, vastly simplifying the software logic and accelerating the\nquery execution. We present a detailed analysis of relational memory using both\nsynthetic benchmarks and realistic workloads. Our relational memory\nimplementation can convert on the fly rows to arbitrary groups of columns\nwithout any latency penalty. Essentially, relational memory can load in cache\nthe desired columns from a row-oriented base data layout as fast as reading\nfrom column-oriented base data layout by outsourcing data transformation to the\nhardware.",

Novel benchmarks for multilingual natural\nlanguage understanding (NLU) include monolingual sentences in several\nlanguages, annotated with intents and slots. In such setup models for\ncross-lingual transfer show remarkable performance in joint intent recognition\nand slot filling. However, existing benchmarks lack of code-switched\nutterances, which are difficult to gather and label due to complexity in the\ngrammatical structure. The evaluation of NLU models seems biased and limited,\nsince code-switching is being left out of scope.\nOur work adopts recognized methods to generate plausible and\nnaturally-sounding code-switched utterances and uses them to create a synthetic\ncode-switched test set. Based on experiments, we report that the\nstate-of-the-art NLU models are unable to handle code-switching. At worst, the\nperformance, evaluated by semantic accuracy, drops as low as 15\\% from 80\\%\nacross languages. Further we show, that pre-training on synthetic code-mixed\ndata helps to maintain performance on the proposed test set at a comparable\nlevel with monolingual data.

Although facts themselves are\nlanguage-agnostic, the fact labels (i.e., language-specific representation of\nthe fact) in the KG are often present only in a few languages. This makes it\nchallenging to link KG facts to sentences in languages other than the limited\nset of languages. To address this problem, we introduce the task of\nMultilingual Fact Linking (MFL) where the goal is to link fact expressed in a\nsentence to corresponding fact in the KG, even when the fact label in the KG is\nnot available in the language of the sentence. To facilitate research in this\narea, we present a new evaluation dataset, IndicLink. This dataset contains\n11,293 linked WikiData facts and 6,429 sentences spanning English and six\nIndian languages. We propose a Retrieval+Generation model, ReFCoG, that can\nscale to millions of KG facts by combining Dual Encoder based retrieval with a\nSeq2Seq based generation model which is constrained to output only valid KG\nfacts. ReFCoG outperforms standard Retrieval+Re-ranking models by 10.7 pts in\nPrecision@1.

    "abstract": "The performance of machine learning algorithms can be considerably improved\nwhen trained over larger datasets. In many domains, such as medicine and\nfinance, larger datasets can be obtained if several parties, each having access\nto limited amounts of data, collaborate and share their data. However, such\ndata sharing introduces significant privacy challenges. While multiple recent\nstudies have investigated methods for private collaborative machine learning,\nthe fairness of such collaborative algorithms was overlooked. In this work we\nsuggest a feasible privacy-preserving pre-process mechanism for enhancing\nfairness of collaborative machine learning algorithms. Our experimentation with\nthe proposed method shows that it is able to enhance fairness considerably with\nonly a minor compromise in accuracy.",

    "abstract": "The digitalization of railway systems should increase the efficiency of the\ntrain operation to achieve future mobility challenges and climate goals. But\nthis digitalization also comes with several new challenges in providing a\nsecure and reliable train operation. The work resulting in this paper tackles\ntwo major challenges. First, there is no single university curriculum combining\ncomputer science, railway operation, and certification processes. Second, many\nrailway processes are still manual and without the usage of digital tools and\nresult in static implementations and configurations of the railway\ninfrastructure devices. This case study occurred as part of the Digital Rail\nSummer School 2021, a university course combining the three mentioned aspects\nas cooperation of several German universities with partners from the railway\nindustry. It passes through all steps from a digital Control-Command and\nSignalling (CCS) planning in ProSig 7.3, the transfer, and validation of the\nplanning in the PlanPro data format and toolbox, to the generation of code of\nan interlocking for the digital CCS planning to contribute to the vision of\ntest automation. This paper contributes the experiences of the case study and a\nproof-of-concept of the whole lifecycle for the Digital Testfield of Deutsche\nBahn in Scheibenberg. This proof-of-concept will be continued in ongoing and\nfollowing projects to fulfill the vision of test automation and automated\nlaunching of new devices.",

    "abstract": "The infrared small-dim target detection is one of the key techniques in the\ninfrared search and tracking system. Since the local regions which similar to\ninfrared small-dim targets spread over the whole background, exploring the\ninteraction information amongst image features in large-range dependencies to\nmine the difference between the target and background is crucial for robust\ndetection. However, existing deep learning-based methods are limited by the\nlocality of convolutional neural networks, which impairs the ability to capture\nlarge-range dependencies. To this end, we propose a new infrared small-dim\ntarget detection method with the transformer. We adopt the self-attention\nmechanism of the transformer to learn the interaction information of image\nfeatures in a larger range. Additionally, we design a feature enhancement\nmodule to learn more features of small-dim targets. After that, we adopt a\ndecoder with the U-Net-like skip connection operation to get the detection\nresult.

    "abstract": "Error correction is widely used in automatic speech recognition (ASR) to\npost-process the generated sentence, and can further reduce the word error rate\n(WER). Although multiple candidates are generated by an ASR system through beam\nsearch, current error correction approaches can only correct one sentence at a\ntime, failing to leverage the voting effect from multiple candidates to better\ndetect and correct error tokens. In this work, we propose FastCorrect 2, an\nerror correction model that takes multiple ASR candidates as input for better\ncorrection accuracy. FastCorrect 2 adopts non-autoregressive generation for\nfast inference, which consists of an encoder that processes multiple source\nsentences and a decoder that generates the target sentence in parallel from the\nadjusted source sentence, where the adjustment is based on the predicted\nduration of each source token. However, there are some issues when handling\nmultiple source sentences. First, it is non-trivial to leverage the voting\neffect from multiple source sentences since they usually vary in length. Thus,\nwe propose a novel alignment algorithm to maximize the degree of token\nalignment among multiple sentences in terms of token and pronunciation\nsimilarity. Second, the decoder can only take one adjusted source sentence as\ninput, while there are multiple source sentences. Thus, we develop a candidate\npredictor to detect the most suitable candidate for the decoder. Experiments on\nour inhouse dataset and AISHELL-1 show that FastCorrect 2 can further reduce\nthe WER over the previous correction model with single candidate by 3.2% and\n2.6%, demonstrating the effectiveness of leveraging multiple candidates in ASR\nerror correction. FastCorrect 2 achieves better performance than the cascaded\nre-scoring and correction pipeline and can serve as a unified post-processing\nmodule for ASR.",

    "abstract": "By constructing digital twins (DT) of an integrated energy system (IES), one\ncan benefit from DT's predictive capabilities to improve coordinations among\nvarious energy converters, hence enhancing energy efficiency, cost savings and\ncarbon emission reduction. This paper is motivated by the fact that practical\nIESs suffer from multiple uncertainty sources, and complicated surrounding\nenvironment. To address this problem, a novel DT-based day-ahead scheduling\nmethod is proposed. The physical IES is modelled as a multi-vector energy\nsystem in its virtual space that interacts with the physical IES to manipulate\nits operations. A deep neural network is trained to make statistical\ncost-saving scheduling by learning from both historical forecasting errors and\nday-ahead forecasts. Case studies of IESs show that the proposed DT-based\nmethod is able to reduce the operating cost of IES by 63.5%, comparing to the\nexisting forecast-based scheduling methods. It is also found that both electric\nvehicles and thermal energy storages play proactive roles in the proposed\nmethod, highlighting their importance in future energy system integration and\ndecarbonisation.",

    "title": "Minimal Expected Regret in Linear Quadratic Control",
    "abstract": "We consider the problem of online learning in Linear Quadratic Control\nsystems whose state transition and state-action transition matrices $A$ and $B$\nmay be initially unknown. We devise an online learning algorithm and provide\nguarantees on its expected regret. This regret at time $T$ is upper bounded (i)\nby $\\widetilde{O}((d_u+d_x)\\sqrt{d_xT})$ when $A$ and $B$ are unknown, (ii) by\n$\\widetilde{O}(d_x^2\\log(T))$ if only $A$ is unknown, and (iii) by\n$\\widetilde{O}(d_x(d_u+d_x)\\log(T))$ if only $B$ is unknown and under some mild\nnon-degeneracy condition ($d_x$ and $d_u$ denote the dimensions of the state\nand of the control input, respectively). These regret scalings are minimal in\n$T$, $d_x$ and $d_u$ as they match existing lower bounds in scenario (i) when\n$d_x\\le d_u$ [SF20], and in scenario (ii) [lai1986]. We conjecture that our\nupper bounds are also optimal in scenario (iii) (there is no known lower bound\nin this setting).\nExisting online algorithms proceed in epochs of (typically exponentially)\ngrowing durations. The control policy is fixed within each epoch, which\nconsiderably simplifies the analysis of the estimation error on $A$ and $B$ and\nhence of the regret. Our algorithm departs from this design choice: it is a\nsimple variant of certainty-equivalence regulators, where the estimates of $A$\nand $B$ and the resulting control policy can be updated as frequently as we\nwish, possibly at every step. Quantifying the impact of such a\nconstantly-varying control policy on the performance of these estimates and on\nthe regret constitutes one of the technical challenges tackled in this paper.",

    "abstract": "One popular example of metaheuristic algorithms from the swarm intelligence\nfamily is the Bat algorithm (BA). The algorithm was first presented in 2010 by\nYang and quickly demonstrated its efficiency in comparison with other common\nalgorithms. The BA is based on echolocation in bats. The BA uses automatic\nzooming to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation by imitating\nthe deviations of the bat's pulse emission rate and loudness as it searches for\nprey. The BA maintains solution diversity using the frequency-tuning technique.\nIn this way, the BA can quickly and efficiently switch from exploration to\nexploitation. Therefore, it becomes an efficient optimizer for any application\nwhen a quick solution is needed. In this paper, an improvement on the original\nBA has been made to speed up convergence and make the method more practical for\nlarge applications. To conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis between the\noriginal BA, the modified BA proposed in this paper, and other state-of-the-art\nbio-inspired metaheuristics, the performance of both approaches is evaluated on\na standard set of 23 (unimodal, multimodal, and fixed-dimension multimodal)\nbenchmark functions. Afterward, the modified BA was applied to solve a\nreal-world job scheduling problem in hotels and restaurants. Based on the\nachieved performance metrics, the proposed MBA establishes better global search\nability and convergence than the original BA and other approaches.",

The tremendous benefits of this technology in civilian\napplications such as hostage rescue and parcel delivery will integrate smart\ncities in the future. Nowadays, the affordability of commercial drones expands\nits usage at a large scale. However, the development of drone technology is\nassociated with vulnerabilities and threats due to the lack of efficient\nsecurity implementations. Moreover, the complexity of UAVs in software and\nhardware triggers potential security and privacy issues. Thus, posing\nsignificant challenges for the industry, academia, and governments. In this\npaper, we extensively survey the security and privacy issues of UAVs by\nproviding a systematic classification at four levels: Hardware-level,\nSoftware-level, Communication-level, and Sensor-level. In particular, for each\nlevel, we thoroughly investigate (1) common vulnerabilities affecting UAVs for\npotential attacks from malicious actors, (2) existing threats that are\njeopardizing the civilian application of UAVs, (3) active and passive attacks\nperformed by the adversaries to compromise the security and privacy of UAVs,\n(4) possible countermeasures and mitigation techniques to protect UAVs from\nsuch malicious activities. In addition, we summarize the takeaways that\nhighlight lessons learned about UAVs' security and privacy issues.

    "title": "One Loss for All: Deep Hashing with a Single Cosine Similarity based  Learning Objective",
    "abstract": "A deep hashing model typically has two main learning objectives: to make the\nlearned binary hash codes discriminative and to minimize a quantization error.\nWith further constraints such as bit balance and code orthogonality, it is not\nuncommon for existing models to employ a large number (>4) of losses. This\nleads to difficulties in model training and subsequently impedes their\neffectiveness. In this work, we propose a novel deep hashing model with only a\nsingle learning objective. Specifically, we show that maximizing the cosine\nsimilarity between the continuous codes and their corresponding binary\northogonal codes can ensure both hash code discriminativeness and quantization\nerror minimization. Further, with this learning objective, code balancing can\nbe achieved by simply using a Batch Normalization (BN) layer and multi-label\nclassification is also straightforward with label smoothing. The result is an\none-loss deep hashing model that removes all the hassles of tuning the weights\nof various losses. Importantly, extensive experiments show that our model is\nhighly effective, outperforming the state-of-the-art multi-loss hashing models\non three large-scale instance retrieval benchmarks, often by significant\nmargins.

    "abstract": "Natural disasters continue to cause tremendous damage to human lives and\nproperties. The Philippines, due to its geographic location, is considered a\nnatural disaster-prone country experiencing an average of 20 tropical cyclones\nannually. Understanding what factors significantly affect decision making\nduring crucial evacuation stages could help in making decisions on how to\nprepare for disasters, how to act appropriately and strategically respond\nduring and after a calamity. In this work, an agent-based model for preemptive\nevacuation decisions during typhoon is presented. In the model, civilians are\nrepresented by households and their evacuation decisions were based from\ncalculated perceived risk. Also, rescuer and shelter manager agents were\nincluded as facilitators during the preemptive evacuation process. National and\nmunicipal census data were employed in the model, particularly for the\ndemographics of household agents. Further, geospatial data of a village in a\ntyphoon-susceptible municipality was used to represent the environment. The\ndecision to evacuate or not to evacuate depends on the agent's perceived risk\nwhich also depends on three decision factors: characteristics of the decision\nmaker (CDM); capacity related factors (CRF); and hazard related factors (HRF).\nFinally, the number of households who decided to evacuate or opted to stay as\ninfluenced by the model`s decision factors were determined during simulations.\nSensitivity analysis using linear regression shows that all parameters used in\nthe model are significant in the evacuation decision of household agents.",

    "abstract": "Scientific discovery concerns finding patterns in data and creating\ninsightful hypotheses that explain these patterns. Traditionally, this process\nrequired human ingenuity, but with the galloping advances in artificial\nintelligence (AI) it becomes feasible to automate some parts of scientific\ndiscovery. In this work we leverage AI for strategy discovery for understanding\nhuman planning. In the state-of-the-art methods data about the process of human\nplanning is often used to group similar behaviors together and formulate verbal\ndescriptions of the strategies which might underlie those groups. Here, we\nautomate these two steps. Our algorithm, called Human-Interpret, uses imitation\nlearning to describe process-tracing data collected in psychological\nexperiments with the Mouselab-MDP paradigm in terms of a procedural formula.\nThen, it translates that formula to natural language using a pre-defined\npredicate dictionary. We test our method on a benchmark data set that\nresearchers have previously scrutinized manually. We find that the descriptions\nof human planning strategies obtained automatically are about as understandable\nas human-generated descriptions. They also cover a substantial proportion of\nall types of human planning strategies that had been discovered manually. Our\nmethod saves scientists' time and effort as all the reasoning about human\nplanning is done automatically. This might make it feasible to more rapidly\nscale up the search for yet undiscovered cognitive strategies to many new\ndecision environments, populations, tasks, and domains. Given these results, we\nbelieve that the presented work may accelerate scientific discovery in\npsychology, and due to its generality, extend to problems from other fields.",

    "abstract": "In many situations it is either impossible or impractical to develop and\nevaluate agents entirely on the target domain on which they will be deployed.\nThis is particularly true in robotics, where doing experiments on hardware is\nmuch more arduous than in simulation. This has become arguably more so in the\ncase of learning-based agents. To this end, considerable recent effort has been\ndevoted to developing increasingly realistic and higher fidelity simulators.\nHowever, we lack any principled way to evaluate how good a ``proxy domain'' is,\nspecifically in terms of how useful it is in helping us achieve our end\nobjective of building an agent that performs well in the target domain. In this\nwork, we investigate methods to address this need. We begin by clearly\nseparating two uses of proxy domains that are often conflated: 1) their ability\nto be a faithful predictor of agent performance and 2) their ability to be a\nuseful tool for learning. In this paper, we attempt to clarify the role of\nproxy domains and establish new proxy usefulness (PU) metrics to compare the\nusefulness of different proxy domains. We propose the relative predictive PU to\nassess the predictive ability of a proxy domain and the learning PU to quantify\nthe usefulness of a proxy as a tool to generate learning data. Furthermore, we\nargue that the value of a proxy is conditioned on the task that it is being\nused to help solve. We demonstrate how these new metrics can be used to\noptimize parameters of the proxy domain for which obtaining ground truth via\nsystem identification is not trivial.",

First, we characterize DRAM timing parameter margins\nand find that certain regions of DRAM can be accessed faster than other regions\ndue to DRAM cell process manufacturing variation. We exploit this by enabling\nvariable access times depending on the DRAM cells being accessed, which not\nonly improves overall system performance, but also decreases power consumption.\nSecond, we find that we can uniquely identify DRAM devices by the locations of\nfailures that result when we access DRAM with timing parameters reduced below\nspecification values. Because we induce these failures with DRAM accesses, we\ncan generate these unique identifiers significantly more quickly than prior\nwork. Third, we propose a random number generator that is based on our\nobservation that timing failures in certain DRAM cells are randomly induced and\ncan thus be repeatedly polled to very quickly generate true random values.\nFinally, we characterize the RowHammer security vulnerability on a wide range\nof modern DRAM chips while violating the DRAM refresh requirement in order to\ndirectly characterize the underlying DRAM technology without the interference\nof refresh commands. We demonstrate with our characterization of real chips,\nthat existing RowHammer mitigation mechanisms either are not scalable or suffer\nfrom prohibitively large performance overheads in projected future devices and\nit is critical to research more effective solutions to RowHammer. Overall, our\nstudies build a new understanding of modern DRAM devices to improve computing\nsystem performance, reliability and security all at the same time.",

    "title": "Analyse or Transmit: Utilising Correlation at the Edge with Deep  Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Millions of sensors, cameras, meters, and other edge devices are deployed in\nnetworks to collect and analyse data. In many cases, such devices are powered\nonly by Energy Harvesting(EH) and have limited energy available to analyse\nacquired data. When edge infrastructure is available, a device has a choice: to\nperform analysis locally or offload the task to other resource-rich devices\nsuch as cloudlet servers. However, such a choice carries a price in terms of\nconsumed energy and accuracy. On the one hand, transmitting raw data can result\nin a higher energy cost in comparison to the required energy to process data\nlocally. On the other hand, performing data analytics on servers can improve\nthe task's accuracy. Additionally, due to the correlation between information\nsent by multiple devices, accuracy might not be affected if some edge devices\ndecide to neither process nor send data and preserve energy instead. For such a\nscenario, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based solution capable\nof learning and adapting the policy to the time-varying energy arrival due to\nEH patterns. We leverage two datasets, one to model energy an EH device can\ncollect and the other to model the correlation between cameras. Furthermore, we\ncompare the proposed solution performance to three baseline policies. Our\nresults show that we can increase accuracy by 15% in comparison to conventional\napproaches while preventing outages.",

    "abstract": "Neural networks have shown tremendous growth in recent years to solve\nnumerous problems. Various types of neural networks have been introduced to\ndeal with different types of problems. However, the main goal of any neural\nnetwork is to transform the non-linearly separable input data into more\nlinearly separable abstract features using a hierarchy of layers. These layers\nare combinations of linear and nonlinear functions. The most popular and common\nnon-linearity layers are activation functions (AFs), such as Logistic Sigmoid,\nTanh, ReLU, ELU, Swish and Mish. In this paper, a comprehensive overview and\nsurvey is presented for AFs in neural networks for deep learning. Different\nclasses of AFs such as Logistic Sigmoid and Tanh based, ReLU based, ELU based,\nand Learning based are covered. Several characteristics of AFs such as output\nrange, monotonicity, and smoothness are also pointed out. A performance\ncomparison is also performed among 18 state-of-the-art AFs with different\nnetworks on different types of data. The insights of AFs are presented to\nbenefit the researchers for doing further research and practitioners to select\namong different choices.

    "abstract": "Developing robust vision-guided controllers for quadrupedal robots in complex\nenvironments, with various obstacles, dynamical surroundings and uneven\nterrains, is very challenging. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a\npromising paradigm for agile locomotion skills with vision inputs in\nsimulation, it is still very challenging to deploy the RL policy in the real\nworld. Our key insight is that aside from the discrepancy in the domain gap, in\nvisual appearance between the simulation and the real world, the latency from\nthe control pipeline is also a major cause of difficulty. In this paper, we\npropose Multi-Modal Delay Randomization (MMDR) to address this issue when\ntraining RL agents. Specifically, we simulate the latency of real hardware by\nusing past observations, sampled with randomized periods, for both\nproprioception and vision. We train the RL policy for end-to-end control in a\nphysical simulator without any predefined controller or reference motion, and\ndirectly deploy it on the real A1 quadruped robot running in the wild. We\nevaluate our method in different outdoor environments with complex terrains and\nobstacles. We demonstrate the robot can smoothly maneuver at a high speed,\navoid the obstacles, and show significant improvement over the baselines.

In this paper, we propose a\ndefinition for the lower and upper finite-state mutual dimensions\n$mdim_{FS}(S:T)$ and $Mdim_{FS}(S:T)$ between two sequences $S \\in\n\\Sigma^\\infty$ and $T \\in \\Sigma^\\infty$ over an alphabet $\\Sigma$.\nIntuitively, the finite-state dimension of a sequence $S \\in \\Sigma^\\infty$\nrepresents the density of finite-state information contained within $S$, while\nthe finite-state mutual dimension between two sequences $S \\in \\Sigma^\\infty$\nand $T \\in \\Sigma^\\infty$ represents the density of finite-state information\nshared by $S$ and $T$. Thus ``finite-state mutual dimension'' can be viewed as\na ``finite-state'' version of mutual dimension and as a ``mutual'' version of\nfinite-state dimension.\nThe main results of this investigation are as follows. First, we show that\nfinite-state mutual dimension, defined using information-lossless finite-state\ncompressors, has all of the properties expected of a measure of mutual\ninformation. Next, we prove that finite-state mutual dimension may be\ncharacterized in terms of block mutual information rates. Finally, we provide\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for two normal sequences to achieve\n$mdim_{FS}(S:T) = Mdim_{FS}(S:T) = 0$.",

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning has substantially advanced medical image\nsegmentation since it alleviates the heavy burden of acquiring the costly\nexpert-examined annotations. Especially, the consistency-based approaches have\nattracted more attention for their superior performance, wherein the real\nlabels are only utilized to supervise their paired images via supervised loss\nwhile the unlabeled images are exploited by enforcing the perturbation-based\n\\textit{\"unsupervised\"} consistency without explicit guidance from those real\nlabels. However, intuitively, the expert-examined real labels contain more\nreliable supervision signals. Observing this, we ask an unexplored but\ninteresting question: can we exploit the unlabeled data via explicit real label\nsupervision for semi-supervised training? To this end, we discard the previous\nperturbation-based consistency but absorb the essence of non-parametric\nprototype learning. Based on the prototypical network, we then propose a novel\ncyclic prototype consistency learning (CPCL) framework, which is constructed by\na labeled-to-unlabeled (L2U) prototypical forward process and an\nunlabeled-to-labeled (U2L) backward process. Such two processes synergistically\nenhance the segmentation network by encouraging more discriminative and compact\nfeatures. In this way, our framework turns previous \\textit{\"unsupervised\"}\nconsistency into new \\textit{\"supervised\"} consistency, obtaining the\n\\textit{\"all-around real label supervision\"} property of our method.

    "abstract": "Purpose: to optimize a pipeline of clinical data gathering and CT images\nprocessing implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis and to develop\nartificial intelligence model for different of viral pneumonia. Methods: 1028\nchest CT image of patients with positive swab were segmented automatically for\nlung extraction. A Gaussian model developed in Python language was applied to\ncalculate quantitative metrics (QM) describing well-aerated and ill portions of\nthe lungs from the histogram distribution of lung CT numbers in both lungs of\neach image and in four geometrical subdivision. Furthermore, radiomic features\n(RF) of first and second order were extracted from bilateral lungs using\nPyRadiomic tools. QM and RF were used to develop 4 different Multi-Layer\nPerceptron (MLP) classifier to discriminate images of patients with COVID\n(n=646) and non-COVID (n=382) viral pneumonia. Results: The Gaussian model\napplied to lung CT histogram correctly described healthy parenchyma 94% of the\npatients. The resulting accuracy of the models for COVID diagnosis were in the\nrange 0.76-0.87, as the integral of the receiver operating curve. The best\ndiagnostic performances were associated to the model based on RF of first and\nsecond order, with 21 relevant features after LASSO regression and an accuracy\nof 0.81$\\pm$0.02 after 4-fold cross validation Conclusions: Despite these\nresults were obtained with CT images from a single center, a platform for\nextracting useful quantitative metrics from CT images was developed and\noptimized. Four artificial intelligence-based models for classifying patients\nwith COVID and non-COVID viral pneumonia were developed and compared showing\noverall good diagnostic performances",

    "abstract": "The problem of phase retrieval, or the algorithmic recovery of lost phase\ninformation from measured intensity alone, underlies various imaging methods\nfrom astronomy to nanoscale imaging. Traditional methods of phase retrieval are\niterative in nature, and are therefore computationally expensive and time\nconsuming. More recently, deep learning (DL) models have been developed to\neither provide learned priors to iterative phase retrieval or in some cases\ncompletely replace phase retrieval with networks that learn to recover the lost\nphase information from measured intensity alone. However, such models require\nvast amounts of labeled data, which can only be obtained through simulation or\nperforming computationally prohibitive phase retrieval on hundreds of or even\nthousands of experimental datasets. Using a 3D nanoscale X-ray imaging modality\n(Bragg Coherent Diffraction Imaging or BCDI) as a representative technique, we\ndemonstrate AutoPhaseNN, a DL-based approach which learns to solve the phase\nproblem without labeled data. By incorporating the physics of the imaging\ntechnique into the DL model during training, AutoPhaseNN learns to invert 3D\nBCDI data from reciprocal space to real space in a single shot without ever\nbeing shown real space images. Once trained, AutoPhaseNN is about one hundred\ntimes faster than traditional iterative phase retrieval methods while providing\ncomparable image quality.",

Until recently only target sound events were considered when\nsynthesizing the soundscapes.

In\nthis paper, we focus on the impact of these non-target events in the synthetic\nsoundscapes. Firstly, we investigate to what extent using non-target events\nalternatively during the training or validation phase (or none of them) helps\nthe system to correctly detect target events. Secondly, we analyze to what\nextend adjusting the signal-to-noise ratio between target and non-target events\nat training improves the sound event detection performance. The results show\nthat using both target and non-target events for only one of the phases\n(validation or training) helps the system to properly detect sound events,\noutperforming the baseline (which uses non-target events in both phases).

This fact became particularly evident\nduring the 2016 U.S. political elections and even more so with the advent of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. Several research studies have shown how the effects of\nfake news dissemination can be mitigated by promoting greater competence\nthrough lifelong learning and discussion communities, and generally rigorous\ntraining in the scientific method and broad interdisciplinary education. The\nurgent need for models that can describe the growing infodemic of fake news has\nbeen highlighted by the current pandemic. The resulting slowdown in vaccination\ncampaigns due to misinformation and generally the inability of individuals to\ndiscern the reliability of information is posing enormous risks to the\ngovernments of many countries. In this research using the tools of kinetic\ntheory we describe the interaction between fake news spreading and competence\nof individuals through multi-population models in which fake news spreads\nanalogously to an infectious disease with different impact depending on the\nlevel of competence of individuals. The level of competence, in particular, is\nsubject to an evolutionary dynamic due to both social interactions between\nagents and external learning dynamics. The results show how the model is able\nto correctly describe the dynamics of diffusion of fake news and the important\nrole of competence in their containment.",

    "abstract": "Bubbles rising in viscoelastic liquids may exhibit a jump discontinuity of\nthe rise velocity as a critical bubble volume is exceeded. The phenomenon has\nbeen extensively investigated in the literature, both by means of experiments\nas well as via numerical simulations. The occurrence of the velocity jump has\nbeen associated with a change of the bubble shape under the formation of a\npointed tip at the rear end and to the appearance of a so-called negative wake\nwith the liquid velocity behind the bubble, pointing in the opposite direction\nto that in viscous Newtonian fluids. We revisit this topic, starting with a\nreview of the state of knowledge on the interrelations between the mentioned\ncharacteristic features. In search for a convincing explanation of the jump\nphenomenon, we performed detailed numerical simulations of the transient rise\nof single bubbles in 3D, allowing for a local polymer molecular conformation\ntensor analysis. The latter shows that polymer molecules traveling along the\nupper bubble hemisphere are stretched in the circumferential direction, due to\nthe flow kinematics. Then, depending on the relaxation time scale of the\npolymer, the stored elastic energy is either unloaded essentially above or\nbelow the bubble's equator. In the former case, this slows down the bubble,\nwhile the bubble gets accelerated otherwise. In this latter case, the relative\nvelocity of the polymer molecules against the bubble is increased, giving rise\nto a self-amplification of the effect and thus causing the bubble rise velocity\nto jump to a higher level. Detailed experimental velocity measurements in the\nliquid field around the bubble confirmed the conclusion that the ratio of the\ntime scale of the Lagrangian transport of polymer molecules along the bubble\ncontour to the relaxation time scale of the polymer molecules determines the\nsub- or supercritical state of the bubble motion.",

Indeed, achieving both statistical zero-knowledge and statistical\nsoundness at the same time with classical verifier is impossible for NP unless\nthe polynomial-time hierarchy collapses, and it is also believed to be\nimpossible even with a quantum verifier. In this work, we introduce a novel\ncompromise, which we call the certified everlasting zero-knowledge proof for\nQMA. It is a computational zero-knowledge proof for QMA, but the verifier\nissues a classical certificate that shows that the verifier has deleted its\nquantum information. If the certificate is valid, even unbounded malicious\nverifier can no longer learn anything beyond the validity of the statement. We\nconstruct a certified everlasting zero-knowledge proof for QMA. For the\nconstruction, we introduce a new quantum cryptographic primitive, which we call\ncommitment with statistical binding and certified everlasting hiding, where the\nhiding property becomes statistical once the receiver has issued a valid\ncertificate that shows that the receiver has deleted the committed information.\nWe construct commitment with statistical binding and certified everlasting\nhiding from quantum encryption with certified deletion by Broadbent and Islam\n[TCC 2020] (in a black box way), and then combine it with the quantum\nsigma-protocol for QMA by Broadbent and Grilo [FOCS 2020] to construct the\ncertified everlasting zero-knowledge proof for QMA.

    "abstract": "Computed Tomography (CT) plays an important role in monitoring\nradiation-induced Pulmonary Fibrosis (PF), where accurate segmentation of the\nPF lesions is highly desired for diagnosis and treatment follow-up. However,\nthe task is challenged by ambiguous boundary, irregular shape, various position\nand size of the lesions, as well as the difficulty in acquiring a large set of\nannotated volumetric images for training. To overcome these problems, we\npropose a novel convolutional neural network called PF-Net and incorporate it\ninto a semi-supervised learning framework based on Iterative Confidence-based\nRefinement And Weighting of pseudo Labels (I-CRAWL). Our PF-Net combines 2D and\n3D convolutions to deal with CT volumes with large inter-slice spacing, and\nuses multi-scale guided dense attention to segment complex PF lesions. For\nsemi-supervised learning, our I-CRAWL employs pixel-level uncertainty-based\nconfidence-aware refinement to improve the accuracy of pseudo labels of\nunannotated images, and uses image-level uncertainty for confidence-based image\nweighting to suppress low-quality pseudo labels in an iterative training\nprocess. Extensive experiments with CT scans of Rhesus Macaques with\nradiation-induced PF showed that: 1) PF-Net achieved higher segmentation\naccuracy than existing 2D, 3D and 2.5D neural networks, and 2) I-CRAWL\noutperformed state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods for the PF\nlesion segmentation task. Our method has a potential to improve the diagnosis\nof PF and clinical assessment of side effects of radiotherapy for lung cancers.",

    "abstract": "We study the asymptotic convergence of AA($m$), i.e., Anderson acceleration\nwith window size $m$ for accelerating fixed-point methods $x_{k+1}=q(x_{k})$,\n$x_k \\in R^n$. Convergence acceleration by AA($m$) has been widely observed but\nis not well understood. We consider the case where the fixed-point iteration\nfunction $q(x)$ is differentiable and the convergence of the fixed-point method\nitself is root-linear. We identify numerically several conspicuous properties\nof AA($m$) convergence: First, AA($m$) sequences $\\{x_k\\}$ converge\nroot-linearly but the root-linear convergence factor depends strongly on the\ninitial condition. Second, the AA($m$) acceleration coefficients $\\beta^{(k)}$\ndo not converge but oscillate as $\\{x_k\\}$ converges to $x^*$. To shed light on\nthese observations, we write the AA($m$) iteration as an augmented fixed-point\niteration $z_{k+1} =\\Psi(z_k)$, $z_k \\in R^{n(m+1)}$ and analyze the continuity\nand differentiability properties of $\\Psi(z)$ and $\\beta(z)$. We find that the\nvector of acceleration coefficients $\\beta(z)$ is not continuous at the fixed\npoint $z^*$. However, we show that, despite the discontinuity of $\\beta(z)$,\nthe iteration function $\\Psi(z)$ is Lipschitz continuous and directionally\ndifferentiable at $z^*$ for AA(1), and we generalize this to AA($m$) with $m>1$\nfor most cases. Furthermore, we find that $\\Psi(z)$ is not differentiable at\n$z^*$. We then discuss how these theoretical findings relate to the observed\nconvergence behaviour of AA($m$). The discontinuity of $\\beta(z)$ at $z^*$\nallows $\\beta^{(k)}$ to oscillate as $\\{x_k\\}$ converges to $x^*$, and the\nnon-differentiability of $\\Psi(z)$ allows AA($m$) sequences to converge with\nroot-linear convergence factors that strongly depend on the initial condition.\nAdditional numerical results illustrate our findings.",

    "abstract": "Decades of research has studied how language learning infants learn to\ndiscriminate speech sounds, segment words, and associate words with their\nmeanings. While gradual development of such capabilities is unquestionable, the\nexact nature of these skills and the underlying mental representations yet\nremains unclear. In parallel, computational studies have shown that basic\ncomprehension of speech can be achieved by statistical learning between speech\nand concurrent referentially ambiguous visual input. These models can operate\nwithout prior linguistic knowledge such as representations of linguistic units,\nand without learning mechanisms specifically targeted at such units. This has\nraised the question of to what extent knowledge of linguistic units, such as\nphone(me)s, syllables, and words, could actually emerge as latent\nrepresentations supporting the translation between speech and representations\nin other modalities, and without the units being proximal learning targets for\nthe learner. In this study, we formulate this idea as the so-called latent\nlanguage hypothesis (LLH), connecting linguistic representation learning to\ngeneral predictive processing within and across sensory modalities. We review\nthe extent that the audiovisual aspect of LLH is supported by the existing\ncomputational studies. We then explore LLH further in extensive learning\nsimulations with different neural network models for audiovisual\ncross-situational learning, and comparing learning from both synthetic and real\nspeech data. We investigate whether the latent representations learned by the\nnetworks reflect phonetic, syllabic, or lexical structure of input speech by\nutilizing an array of complementary evaluation metrics related to linguistic\nselectivity and temporal characteristics of the representations.

    "abstract": "Precise segmentation of knee tissues from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is\ncritical in quantitative imaging and diagnosis. Convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs), which are state of the art, have limitations owing to the lack of\nimage-specific adaptation, such as low tissue contrasts and structural\ninhomogeneities, thereby leading to incomplete segmentation results. This paper\npresents a deep learning based automatic segmentation framework for knee tissue\nsegmentation. A novel multipath CNN-based method is proposed, which consists of\nan encoder decoder-based segmentation network in combination with a low rank\ntensor-reconstructed segmentation network. Low rank reconstruction in MRI\ntensor sub-blocks is introduced to exploit the structural and morphological\nvariations in knee tissues. To further improve the segmentation from CNNs,\ntrimap generation, which effectively utilizes superimposed regions, is proposed\nfor defining high, medium and low confidence regions from the multipath CNNs.\nThe secondary path with low rank reconstructed input mitigates the conditions\nin which the primary segmentation network can potentially fail and overlook the\nboundary regions. The outcome of the segmentation is solved as an alpha matting\nproblem by blending the trimap with the source input. Experiments on\nOsteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) datasets and a self prepared scan validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method. We specifically demonstrate the\napplication of the proposed method in a cartilage segmentation based thickness\nmap for diagnosis purposes.",

In order to control the nonlinear numerical dissipation\nadaptively, the flow scales are first measured by examining the first-order\nundivided difference and the cut-off constant $C_T$ in the TENO weighting\nstrategy is adapted based on the corresponding measurement.

    "abstract": "Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) are able to amend radio propagation\ncondition tasks on account of its functional properties in phase shift\noptimizing. In fact, there exists geometry manifold in the base-station (BS)\nbeamforming matrix and IRS reflection vector. Therefore, we propose a novel\ndouble manifold alternating optimization (DMAO) algorithm which makes use of\ndifferential geometry theory to improve optimization performance. First, we\ndevelop a multi-IRS multi-user system model to maximize the weighted sum-rate,\nwhich may lead to the non-convexity in our optimization procedure. Then in\norder to allocate an optimized coefficients to each BS antenna and IRS\nreflecting element, we present the beamforming matrix and reflection vector\nusing complex sphere manifold and complex oblique manifold, respectively, which\nintegrates the inner geometry structure and the constrains. By an innovative\nalternative iteration method, the system gradually converges an optimized\nstable state, which is associating with the maximized sum-rate. Furthermore, we\nquantize the IRS reflection coefficient considering the practical constrains.\nExperimental results demonstrated that our approach significantly outperforms\nthe conventional methods in terms of weighted sum-rate.",

    "abstract": "Class imbalance is common in medical image classification tasks, where the\nnumber of abnormal samples is fewer than the number of normal samples. The\ndifficulty of imbalanced classification is compounded by other issues such as\nthe size and distribution of the dataset. Reliable training of deep neural\nnetworks continues to be a major challenge in such class-imbalanced conditions.\nThe loss function used to train the deep neural networks highly impact the\nperformance of both balanced and imbalanced tasks. Currently, the cross-entropy\nloss remains the de-facto loss function for balanced and imbalanced\nclassification tasks. This loss, however, asserts equal learning to all\nclasses, leading to the classification of most samples as the majority normal\nclass.

This assumption renders these theories inadequate for\ncharacterizing 21$^{st}$ century real world data problems, which are typically\ncharacterized by evaluation distributions that differ from the training data\ndistributions (referred to as out-of-distribution learning). We therefore make\na small change to existing formal definitions of learnability by relaxing that\nassumption. We then introduce \\textbf{learning efficiency} (LE) to quantify the\namount a learner is able to leverage data for a given problem, regardless of\nwhether it is an in- or out-of-distribution problem. We then define and prove\nthe relationship between generalized notions of learnability, and show how this\nframework is sufficiently general to characterize transfer, multitask, meta,\ncontinual, and lifelong learning. We hope this unification helps bridge the gap\nbetween empirical practice and theoretical guidance in real world problems.\nFinally, because biological learning continues to outperform machine learning\nalgorithms on certain OOD challenges, we discuss the limitations of this\nframework vis-\\'a-vis its ability to formalize biological learning, suggesting\nmultiple avenues for future research.",

    "title": "An Energy Efficient Health Monitoring Approach with Wireless Body Area  Networks",
    "abstract": "Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) comprise a network of sensors\nsubcutaneously implanted or placed near the body surface and facilitate\ncontinuous monitoring of health parameters of a patient. Research endeavours\ninvolving WBAN are directed towards effective transmission of detected\nparameters to a Local Processing Unit (LPU, usually a mobile device) and\nanalysis of the parameters at the LPU or a back-end cloud. An important concern\nin WBAN is the lightweight nature of WBAN nodes and the need to conserve their\nenergy. This is especially true for subcutaneously implanted nodes that cannot\nbe recharged or regularly replaced. Work in energy conservation is mostly aimed\nat optimising the routing of signals to minimise energy expended. In this\npaper, a simple yet innovative approach to energy conservation and detection of\nalarming health status is proposed. Energy conservation is ensured through a\ntwo-tier approach wherein the first tier eliminates `uninteresting' health\nparameter readings at the site of a sensing node and prevents these from being\ntransmitted across the WBAN to the LPU. A reading is categorised as\nuninteresting if it deviates very slightly from its immediately preceding\nreading and does not provide new insight on the patient's well being. In\naddition to this, readings that are faulty and emanate from possible sensor\nmalfunctions are also eliminated. These eliminations are done at the site of\nthe sensor using algorithms that are light enough to effectively function in\nthe extremely resource-constrained environments of the sensor nodes. We notice,\nthrough experiments, that this eliminates and thus reduces around 90% of the\nreadings that need to be transmitted to the LPU leading to significant energy\nsavings. Furthermore, the proper functioning of these algorithms in such\nconstrained environments is confirmed and validated over a hardware simulation\nset up. The second tier of assessment includes a proposed anomaly detection\nmodel at the LPU that is capable of identifying anomalies from streaming health\nparameter readings and indicates an adverse medical condition. In addition to\nbeing able to handle streaming data, the model works within the\nresource-constrained environments of an LPU and eliminates the need of\ntransmitting the data to a back-end cloud, ensuring further energy savings. The\nanomaly detection capability of the model is validated using data available\nfrom the critical care units of hospitals and is shown to be superior to other\nanomaly detection techniques.",

However, existing deep blind methods\nusually directly reconstruct the image without predicting the quality factor,\nthus lacking the flexibility to control the output as the non-blind methods. To\nremedy this problem, in this paper, we propose a flexible blind convolutional\nneural network, namely FBCNN, that can predict the adjustable quality factor to\ncontrol the trade-off between artifacts removal and details preservation.\nSpecifically, FBCNN decouples the quality factor from the JPEG image via a\ndecoupler module and then embeds the predicted quality factor into the\nsubsequent reconstructor module through a quality factor attention block for\nflexible control. Besides, we find existing methods are prone to fail on\nnon-aligned double JPEG images even with only a one-pixel shift, and we thus\npropose a double JPEG degradation model to augment the training data. Extensive\nexperiments on single JPEG images, more general double JPEG images, and\nreal-world JPEG images demonstrate that our proposed FBCNN achieves favorable\nperformance against state-of-the-art methods in terms of both quantitative\nmetrics and visual quality.",

Our bounds depend on the\ninterplay between a pair of graphs: the Tanner graph of the set of measured\nPauli operators, and the connectivity graph which represents the qubit\nconnections required to implement the circuit. For local-expander quantum\ncodes, which are promising for low-overhead quantum error correction, we prove\nthat any syndrome extraction circuit implemented with local Clifford gates in a\n2D square patch of $N$ qubits has depth at least $\\Omega(n/\\sqrt{N})$ where $n$\nis the code length. Then, we propose two families of quantum circuits\nsaturating this bound. First, we construct 2D local syndrome extraction\ncircuits for quantum LDPC codes with bounded depth using only $O(n^2)$ ancilla\nqubits. Second, we design a family of 2D local syndrome extraction circuits for\nhypergraph product codes using $O(n)$ ancilla qubits with depth $O(\\sqrt{n})$.\nFinally, we use circuit noise simulations to compare the performance of a\nfamily of hypergraph product codes using this last family of 2D syndrome\nextraction circuits with a syndrome extraction circuit implemented with fully\nconnected qubits. While there is a threshold of about $10^{-3}$ for a fully\nconnected implementation, we observe no threshold for the 2D local\nimplementation despite simulating error rates of as low as $10^{-6}$. This\nsuggests that quantum LDPC codes are impractical with 2D local quantum\nhardware. We believe that our proof technique is of independent interest and\ncould find other applications. Our bounds on circuit sizes are derived from a\nlower bound on the amount of correlations between two subsets of qubits of the\ncircuit and an upper bound on the amount of correlations introduced by each\ncircuit gate, which together provide a lower bound on the circuit size.",

    "title": "Constant-overhead quantum error correction with thin planar connectivity",
    "abstract": "Quantum LDPC codes may provide a path to build low-overhead fault-tolerant\nquantum computers. However, as general LDPC codes lack geometric constraints,\nna\\\"ive layouts couple many distant qubits with crossing connections which\ncould be hard to build in hardware and could result in performance-degrading\ncrosstalk. We propose a 2D layout for quantum LDPC codes by decomposing their\nTanner graphs into a small number of planar layers. Each layer contains\nlong-range connections which do not cross. For any CSS code with a\ndegree-$\\delta$ Tanner graph, we design stabilizer measurement circuits with\ndepth at most $(2\\delta +2)$ using at most $\\lceil \\delta/2 \\rceil$ layers. We\nobserve a circuit-noise threshold of 0.28\\% for a positive-rate code family\nusing 49 physical qubits per logical qubit. For a physical error rate of\n$10^{-4}$, this family reaches a logical error rate of $10^{-15}$ using\nfourteen times fewer physical qubits than the surface code.",
