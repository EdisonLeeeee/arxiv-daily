    "abstract": "The measured spatiotemporal response of various physical processes is\nutilized to infer the governing partial differential equations (PDEs). We\npropose SimultaNeous Basis Function Approximation and Parameter Estimation\n(SNAPE), a technique of parameter estimation of PDEs that is robust against\nhigh levels of noise nearly 100 %, by simultaneously fitting basis functions to\nthe measured response and estimating the parameters of both ordinary and\npartial differential equations. The domain knowledge of the general\nmultidimensional process is used as a constraint in the formulation of the\noptimization framework. SNAPE not only demonstrates its applicability on\nvarious complex dynamic systems that encompass wide scientific domains\nincluding Schr\\\"odinger equation, chaotic duffing oscillator, and Navier-Stokes\nequation but also estimates an analytical approximation to the process\nresponse. The method systematically combines the knowledge of well-established\nscientific theories and the concepts of data science to infer the properties of\nthe process from the observed data.",

    "abstract": "Melt pool (MP) temperature is one of the determining factors and key\nsignatures for the properties of printed components during metal additive\nmanufacturing (AM). The state-of-the art measurement systems are hindered by\nboth the equipment cost and the large-scale data acquisition and processing\ndemands. In this work, we introduce a novel coaxial high-speed single-camera\ntwo-wavelength imaging pyrometer (STWIP) system as opposed to the typical\nutilization of multiple cameras for measuring MP temperature profiles through a\nlaser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process. Developed on a commercial LPBF machine\n(EOS M290), the STWIP system is demonstrated to be able to quantitatively\nmonitor MP temperature and variation for 50 layers at high framerates (> 30,000\nfps) during a print of five standard fatigue specimens. High performance\ncomputing is employed to analyze the acquired big data of MP images for\ndetermining each MPs average temperature and 2D temperature profile. The MP\ntemperature evolution in the gage section of a fatigue specimen is also\nexamined at a temporal resolution of 1ms by evaluating the derived MP\ntemperatures of the printed samples first, middle and last layers. This paper\nis first of its kind on monitoring MP temperature distribution and evolution at\nsuch a large, detailed scale for longer durations in practical applications.\nFuture work includes MP registration and machine learning of MP-Part Property\nrelations.",

    "title": "Learning Robot Structure and Motion Embeddings using Graph Neural  Networks",
    "abstract": "We propose a learning framework to find the representation of a robot's\nkinematic structure and motion embedding spaces using graph neural networks\n(GNN). Finding a compact and low-dimensional embedding space for complex\nphenomena is a key for understanding its behaviors, which may lead to a better\nlearning performance, as we observed in other domains of images or languages.\nHowever, although numerous robotics applications deal with various types of\ndata, the embedding of the generated data has been relatively less studied by\nroboticists. To this end, our work aims to learn embeddings for two types of\nrobotic data: the robot's design structure, such as links, joints, and their\nrelationships, and the motion data, such as kinematic joint positions. Our\nmethod exploits the tree structure of the robot to train appropriate embeddings\nto the given robot data. To avoid overfitting, we formulate multi-task learning\nto find a general representation of the embedding spaces. We evaluate the\nproposed learning method on a robot with a simple linear structure and\nvisualize the learned embeddings using t-SNE. We also study a few design\nchoices of the learning framework, such as network architectures and message\npassing schemes.",

    "abstract": "A nonlinear multigrid solver for two-phase flow and transport in a mixed\nfractional-flow velocity-pressure-saturation formulation is proposed. The\nsolver, which is under the framework of the full approximation scheme (FAS),\nextends our previous work on nonlinear multigrid for heterogeneous diffusion\nproblems. The coarse spaces in the multigrid hierarchy are constructed by first\naggregating degrees of freedom, and then solving some local flow problems. The\nmixed formulation and the choice of coarse spaces allow us to assemble the\ncoarse problems without visiting finer levels during the solving phase, which\nis crucial for the scalability of multigrid methods. Specifically, a natural\ngeneralization of the upwind flux can be evaluated directly on coarse levels\nusing the precomputed coarse flux basis vectors. The resulting solver is\napplicable to problems discretized on general unstructured grids. The\nperformance of the proposed nonlinear multigrid solver in comparison with the\nstandard single level Newton's method is demonstrated through challenging\nnumerical examples. It is observed that the proposed solver is robust for\nhighly nonlinear problems and clearly outperforms Newton's method in the case\nof high Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) numbers.",

    "abstract": "Kidney DCE-MRI aims at both qualitative assessment of kidney anatomy and\nquantitative assessment of kidney function by estimating the tracer kinetic\n(TK) model parameters. Accurate estimation of TK model parameters requires an\naccurate measurement of the arterial input function (AIF) with high temporal\nresolution. Accelerated imaging is used to achieve high temporal resolution,\nwhich yields under-sampling artifacts in the reconstructed images. Compressed\nsensing (CS) methods offer a variety of reconstruction options. Most commonly,\nsparsity of temporal differences is encouraged for regularization to reduce\nartifacts. Increasing regularization in CS methods removes the ambient\nartifacts but also over-smooths the signal temporally which reduces the\nparameter estimation accuracy. In this work, we propose a single image trained\ndeep neural network to reduce MRI under-sampling artifacts without reducing the\naccuracy of functional imaging markers. Instead of regularizing with a penalty\nterm in optimization, we promote regularization by generating images from a\nlower dimensional representation. In this manuscript we motivate and explain\nthe lower dimensional input design. We compare our approach to CS\nreconstructions with multiple regularization weights. Proposed approach results\nin kidney biomarkers that are highly correlated with the ground truth markers\nestimated using the CS reconstruction which was optimized for functional\nanalysis.

    "abstract": "In recent years, online ride-hailing platforms have become an indispensable\npart of urban transportation. After a passenger is matched up with a driver by\nthe platform, both the passenger and the driver have the freedom to simply\naccept or cancel a ride with one click. Hence, accurately predicting whether a\npassenger-driver pair is a good match turns out to be crucial for ride-hailing\nplatforms to devise instant order assignments. However, since the users of\nride-hailing platforms consist of two parties, decision-making needs to\nsimultaneously account for the dynamics from both the driver and the passenger\nsides. This makes it more challenging than traditional online advertising\ntasks. Moreover, the amount of available data is severely imbalanced across\ndifferent cities, creating difficulties for training an accurate model for\nsmaller cities with scarce data. Though a sophisticated neural network\narchitecture can help improve the prediction accuracy under data scarcity, the\noverly complex design will impede the model's capacity of delivering timely\npredictions in a production environment. In the paper, to accurately predict\nthe MSR of passenger-driver, we propose the Multi-View model (MV) which\ncomprehensively learns the interactions among the dynamic features of the\npassenger, driver, trip order, as well as context.

These traditional\napproaches cannot cope with network data challenges. As a new learning\nparadigm, network representation learning has been proposed to map a real-world\ninformation network into a low-dimensional space while preserving inherent\nproperties of the network. In this paper, we present a systematic comprehensive\nsurvey of network representation learning, known also as network embedding,\nfrom birth to the current development state. Through the undertaken survey, we\nprovide a comprehensive view of reasons behind the emergence of network\nembedding and, types of settings and models used in the network embedding\npipeline. Thus, we introduce a brief history of representation learning and\nword representation learning ancestor of network embedding. We provide also\nformal definitions of basic concepts required to understand network\nrepresentation learning followed by a description of network embedding\npipeline. Most commonly used downstream tasks to evaluate embeddings, their\nevaluation metrics and popular datasets are highlighted. Finally, we present\nthe open-source libraries for network embedding.",

The problems considered in this paper have been studied by\nChan~(2020), who gave algorithms that solve them, in the standard real-RAM\nmodel, in $O((n^2/\\log^2n)\\log^{O(1)}\\log n)$ time. We present solutions in the\nalgebraic decision-tree model whose cost is $O(n^{60/31+\\varepsilon})$, for any\n$\\varepsilon>0$.\nOur approach is based on a primal-dual range searching mechanism, which\nexploits the multi-level polynomial partitioning machinery recently developed\nby Agarwal, Aronov, Ezra, and Zahl~(2020).\nA key step in the procedure is a variant of point location in arrangements,\nsay of lines in the plane, which is based solely on the \\emph{order type} of\nthe lines, a \"handicap\" that turns out to be beneficial for speeding up our\nalgorithm.",

On the language side, most of these models primarily focus on English\nsince most multi-modal datasets are monolingual. We try to bridge this gap with\na zero-shot approach for learning multi-modal representations using\ncross-lingual pre-training on the text side. We present a simple yet practical\napproach for building a cross-lingual image retrieval model which trains on a\nmonolingual training dataset but can be used in a zero-shot cross-lingual\nfashion during inference. We also introduce a new objective function which\ntightens the text embedding clusters by pushing dissimilar texts away from each\nother. For evaluation, we introduce a new 1K multi-lingual MSCOCO2014 caption\ntest dataset (XTD10) in 7 languages that we collected using a crowdsourcing\nplatform. We use this as the test set for zero-shot model performance across\nlanguages. We also demonstrate how a cross-lingual model can be used for\ndownstream tasks like multi-lingual image tagging in a zero shot manner. XTD10\ndataset is made publicly available here:\nhttps://github.com/adobe-research/Cross-lingual-Test-Dataset-XTD10.",

    "title": "BacHMMachine: An Interpretable and Scalable Model for Algorithmic  Harmonization for Four-part Baroque Chorales",
    "abstract": "Algorithmic harmonization - the automated harmonization of a musical piece\ngiven its melodic line - is a challenging problem that has garnered much\ninterest from both music theorists and computer scientists. One genre of\nparticular interest is the four-part Baroque chorales of J.S. Bach. Methods for\nalgorithmic chorale harmonization typically adopt a black-box, \"data-driven\"\napproach: they do not explicitly integrate principles from music theory but\nrely on a complex learning model trained with a large amount of chorale data.\nWe propose instead a new harmonization model, called BacHMMachine, which\nemploys a \"theory-driven\" framework guided by music composition principles,\nalong with a \"data-driven\" model for learning compositional features within\nthis framework. As its name suggests, BacHMMachine uses a novel Hidden Markov\nModel based on key and chord transitions, providing a probabilistic framework\nfor learning key modulations and chordal progressions from a given melodic\nline. This allows for the generation of creative, yet musically coherent\nchorale harmonizations; integrating compositional principles allows for a much\nsimpler model that results in vast decreases in computational burden and\ngreater interpretability compared to state-of-the-art algorithmic harmonization\nmethods, at no penalty to quality of harmonization or musicality. We\ndemonstrate this improvement via comprehensive experiments and Turing tests\ncomparing BacHMMachine to existing methods.",

In our protocol, only encrypted files are transferred. The cryptographic\nkey is stored in the world state in a secure way and can be accessed only by\nauthorized parties. A receiver has to request the corresponding cryptographic\nkey from the sender to decrypt such encrypted files. All requests are run\nthrough transactions to establish reliable chain of custody.

To better understand how discussions on different\ntopics/oral diseases vary across the users, we acquire or infer demographic\ninformation of users and other characteristics based on retrieved information\nfrom user profiles. Women and younger adults (19-29) are more likely to talk\nabout oral health problems. We use the LDA topic model to extract the major\ntopics/oral diseases in tweets. Overall, 26.70% of the Twitter users talk about\nwisdom tooth pain/jaw hurt, 23.86% tweet about dental service/cavity, 18.97%\ndiscuss chipped tooth/tooth break, 16.23% talk about dental pain, and the rest\nare about tooth decay/gum bleeding.

People from counties with higher\ninsurance coverage tend to tweet less about all topics of oral diseases. People\nfrom counties at a higher risk of COVID-19 talk more about tooth decay/gum\nbleeding and chipped tooth/tooth break.

The key\npoints of RGBT tracking lie in feature extraction and feature fusion of visible\nand infrared images. Current RGBT tracking methods mostly pay attention to both\nindividual features (features extracted from images of a single camera) and\ncommon features (features extracted and fused from an RGB camera and a thermal\ncamera), while pay less attention to the different and dynamic contributions of\nindividual features and common features for different sequences of registered\nimage pairs. This paper proposes a novel RGBT tracking method, called Dynamic\nFusion Network (DFNet), which adopts a two-stream structure, in which two\nnon-shared convolution kernels are employed in each layer to extract individual\nfeatures. Besides, DFNet has shared convolution kernels for each layer to\nextract common features. Non-shared convolution kernels and shared convolution\nkernels are adaptively weighted and summed according to different image pairs,\nso that DFNet can deal with different contributions for different sequences.\nDFNet has a fast speed, which is 28.658 FPS. The experimental results show that\nwhen DFNet only increases the Mult-Adds of 0.02% than the\nnon-shared-convolution-kernel-based fusion method, Precision Rate (PR) and\nSuccess Rate (SR) reach 88.1% and 71.9% respectively.",

    "abstract": "We propose an Ontology-Based Information Extraction (OBIE) system to automate\nthe extraction of the criteria and values applied in Land Use Suitability\nAnalysis (LUSA) from bylaw and regulation documents related to the geographic\narea of interest. The results obtained by our proposed LUSA OBIE system (land\nuse suitability criteria and their values) are presented as an ontology\npopulated with instances of the extracted criteria and property values. This\nlatter output ontology is incorporated into a Multi-Criteria Decision Making\n(MCDM) model applied for constructing suitability maps for different kinds of\nland uses. The resulting maps may be the final desired product or can be\nincorporated into the cellular automata urban modeling and simulation for\npredicting future urban growth. A case study has been conducted where the\noutput from LUSA OBIE is applied to help produce a suitability map for the City\nof Regina, Saskatchewan, to assist in the identification of suitable areas for\nresidential development. A set of Saskatchewan bylaw and regulation documents\nwere downloaded and input to the LUSA OBIE system. We accessed the extracted\ninformation using both the populated LUSA ontology and the set of annotated\ndocuments. In this regard, the LUSA OBIE system was effective in producing a\nfinal suitability map.",

    "abstract": "We study the class of reach-avoid dynamic games in which multiple agents\ninteract noncooperatively, and each wishes to satisfy a distinct target\ncondition while avoiding a failure condition. Reach-avoid games are commonly\nused to express safety-critical optimal control problems found in mobile robot\nmotion planning. While a wide variety of approaches exist for these motion\nplanning problems, we focus on finding time-consistent solutions, in which\nplanned future motion is still optimal despite prior suboptimal actions. Though\nabstract, time consistency encapsulates an extremely desirable property:\nnamely, time-consistent motion plans remain optimal even when a robot's motion\ndiverges from the plan early on due to, e.g., intrinsic dynamic uncertainty or\nextrinsic environment disturbances. Our main contribution is a\ncomputationally-efficient algorithm for multi-agent reach-avoid games which\nrenders time-consistent solutions. We demonstrate our approach in a simulated\ndriving scenario, where we construct a two-player adversarial game to model a\nrange of defensive driving behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Reasoning over commonsense knowledge bases (CSKB) whose elements are in the\nform of free-text is an important yet hard task in NLP. While CSKB completion\nonly fills the missing links within the domain of the CSKB, CSKB population is\nalternatively proposed with the goal of reasoning unseen assertions from\nexternal resources. In this task, CSKBs are grounded to a large-scale\neventuality (activity, state, and event) graph to discriminate whether novel\ntriples from the eventuality graph are plausible or not. However, existing\nevaluations on the population task are either not accurate (automatic\nevaluation with randomly sampled negative examples) or of small scale (human\nannotation). In this paper, we benchmark the CSKB population task with a new\nlarge-scale dataset by first aligning four popular CSKBs, and then presenting a\nhigh-quality human-annotated evaluation set to probe neural models' commonsense\nreasoning ability. We also propose a novel inductive commonsense reasoning\nmodel that reasons over graphs. Experimental results show that generalizing\ncommonsense reasoning on unseen assertions is inherently a hard task. Models\nachieving high accuracy during training perform poorly on the evaluation set,\nwith a large gap between human performance. We will make the data publicly\navailable for future contributions.

The matrix\nfactorization model has become a mainstream cornerstone technique for\ncomputational drug repositioning due to its ease of implementation and\nexcellent scalability.

    "abstract": "Road extraction is an essential step in building autonomous navigation\nsystems. Detecting road segments is challenging as they are of varying widths,\nbifurcated throughout the image, and are often occluded by terrain, cloud, or\nother weather conditions. Using just convolution neural networks (ConvNets) for\nthis problem is not effective as it is inefficient at capturing distant\ndependencies between road segments in the image which is essential to extract\nroad connectivity. To this end, we propose a Spatial and Interaction Space\nGraph Reasoning (SPIN) module which when plugged into a ConvNet performs\nreasoning over graphs constructed on spatial and interaction spaces projected\nfrom the feature maps. Reasoning over spatial space extracts dependencies\nbetween different spatial regions and other contextual information. Reasoning\nover a projected interaction space helps in appropriate delineation of roads\nfrom other topographies present in the image. Thus, SPIN extracts long-range\ndependencies between road segments and effectively delineates roads from other\nsemantics. We also introduce a SPIN pyramid which performs SPIN graph reasoning\nacross multiple scales to extract multi-scale features. We propose a network\nbased on stacked hourglass modules and SPIN pyramid for road segmentation which\nachieves better performance compared to existing methods.

However, for the one-step HQP, the solution can\noscillate when it is close to the boundary of constraints. It is because the\nabrupt hit of the bounds gives rise to unrealisable jerks and even infeasible\nsolutions. This paper proposes the mixed control, which blends the single-axis\nmodel predictive control (MPC) and proportional derivate (PD) control for the\nwhole-body compliance to overcome these deficiencies. The MPC predicts the\ndistances between the bounds and the control target of the critical tasks, and\nit provides smooth and feasible solutions by prediction and optimisation in\nadvance. However, applying MPC will inevitably increase the computation time.\nTherefore, to achieve a 500 Hz servo rate, the PD controllers still regulate\nother tasks to save computation resources. Also, we use a more efficient null\nspace projection (NSP) whole-body controller instead of the HQP and distribute\nthe single-axis MPCs into four CPU cores for parallel computation.

We demonstrate that Basil\nalongside ACDS with only $5\\%$ data sharing provides effective toleration of\nByzantine nodes, unlike the state-of-the-art Byzantine robust algorithm that\ncompletely fails in the heterogeneous data setting. Finally, to reduce the\noverall latency of Basil resulting from its sequential implementation over the\nlogical ring, we propose Basil+. In particular, Basil+ provides scalability by\nenabling Byzantine-robust parallel training across groups of logical rings, and\nat the same time, it retains the performance gains of Basil due to sequential\ntraining within each group. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate the\nscalability gains of Basil+ through different sets of experiments.",

    "title": "Dense Pruning of Pointwise Convolutions in the Frequency Domain",
    "abstract": "Depthwise separable convolutions and frequency-domain convolutions are two\nrecent ideas for building efficient convolutional neural networks. They are\nseemingly incompatible: the vast majority of operations in depthwise separable\nCNNs are in pointwise convolutional layers, but pointwise layers use 1x1\nkernels, which do not benefit from frequency transformation. This paper unifies\nthese two ideas by transforming the activations, not the kernels. Our key\ninsights are that 1) pointwise convolutions commute with frequency\ntransformation and thus can be computed in the frequency domain without\nmodification, 2) each channel within a given layer has a different level of\nsensitivity to frequency domain pruning, and 3) each channel's sensitivity to\nfrequency pruning is approximately monotonic with respect to frequency. We\nleverage this knowledge by proposing a new technique which wraps each pointwise\nlayer in a discrete cosine transform (DCT) which is truncated to selectively\nprune coefficients above a given threshold as per the needs of each channel. To\nlearn which frequencies should be pruned from which channels, we introduce a\nnovel learned parameter which specifies each channel's pruning threshold. We\nadd a new regularization term which incentivizes the model to decrease the\nnumber of retained frequencies while still maintaining task accuracy. Unlike\nweight pruning techniques which rely on sparse operators, our contiguous\nfrequency band pruning results in fully dense computation. We apply our\ntechnique to MobileNetV2 and in the process reduce computation time by 22% and\nincur <1% accuracy degradation.",

    "abstract": "Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) enables a simple, attractive framework for\nsecure search. Compared to other secure search systems, no costly setup\nprocedure is necessary; it is sufficient for the client merely to upload the\nencrypted database to the server. Confidentiality is provided because the\nserver works only on the encrypted query and records. While the search\nfunctionality is enabled by the full homomorphism of the encryption scheme.\nFor this reason, researchers have been paying increasing attention to this\nproblem. Since Akavia et al. (CCS 2018) presented a framework for secure search\non FHE encrypted data and gave a working implementation called SPiRiT, several\nmore efficient realizations have been proposed.\nIn this paper, we identify the main bottlenecks of this framework and show\nhow to significantly improve the performance of FHE-base secure search. In\nparticular,\n1. To retrieve $\\ell$ matching items, the existing framework needs to repeat\nthe protocol $\\ell$ times sequentially. In our new framework, all matching\nitems are retrieved in parallel in a single protocol execution.\n2. The most recent work by Wren et al. (CCS 2020) requires $O(n)$\nmultiplications to compute the first matching index. Our solution requires no\nhomomorphic multiplication, instead using only additions and scalar\nmultiplications to encode all matching indices.\n3. Our implementation and experiments show that to fetch 16 matching records,\nour system gives an 1800X speed-up over the state of the art in fetching the\nquery results resulting in a 26X speed-up for the full search functionality.",

    "abstract": "Machine/deep-learning (ML/DL) based techniques are emerging as a driving\nforce behind many cutting-edge technologies, achieving high accuracy on\ncomputer vision workloads such as image classification and object detection.\nHowever, training these models involving large parameters is both\ntime-consuming and energy-hogging. In this regard, several prior works have\nadvocated for sparsity to speed up the of DL training and more so, the\ninference phase. This work begins with the observation that during training,\nsparsity in the forward and backward passes are correlated. In that context, we\ninvestigate two types of sparsity (input and output type) inherent in gradient\ndescent-based optimization algorithms and propose a hardware micro-architecture\nto leverage the same. Our experimental results use five state-of-the-art CNN\nmodels on the Imagenet dataset, and show back propagation speedups in the range\nof 1.69$\\times$ to 5.43$\\times$, compared to the dense baseline execution. By\nexploiting sparsity in both the forward and backward passes, speedup\nimprovements range from 1.68$\\times$ to 3.30$\\times$ over the sparsity-agnostic\nbaseline execution.

Threat models for these demonstrations are limited to (1)\ntargeted attacks through real-time manipulation of the agent's observation, and\n(2) untargeted attacks through manipulation of the physical environment. The\nformer assumes full access to the agent's states/observations at all times,\nwhile the latter has no control over attack outcomes. This paper investigates\nthe feasibility of targeted attacks through visually learned patterns placed on\nphysical object in the environment, a threat model that combines the\npracticality and effectiveness of the existing ones. Through analysis, we\ndemonstrate that a pre-trained policy can be hijacked within a time window,\ne.g., performing an unintended self-parking, when an adversarial object is\npresent. To enable the attack, we adopt an assumption that the dynamics of both\nthe environment and the agent can be learned by the attacker. Lastly, we\nempirically show the effectiveness of the proposed attack on different driving\nscenarios, perform a location robustness test, and study the tradeoff between\nthe attack strength and its effectiveness.",

An important approach for mitigating this threat is remote attestation,\nwhich enables the defender to remotely verify the integrity of devices and\ntheir software. There are a number of approaches for remote attestation, and\neach has its unique advantages and disadvantages in terms of detection accuracy\nand computational cost. Further, an attestation method may be applied in\nmultiple ways, such as various levels of software coverage. Therefore, to\nminimize both security risks and computational overhead, defenders need to\ndecide strategically which attestation methods to apply and how to apply them,\ndepending on the characteristic of the devices and the potential losses.\nTo answer these questions, we first develop a testbed for remote attestation\nof IoT devices, which enables us to measure the detection accuracy and\nperformance overhead of various attestation methods. Our testbed integrates two\nexample IoT applications, memory-checksum based attestation, and a variety of\nsoftware vulnerabilities that allow adversaries to inject arbitrary code into\nrunning applications.

We\nhave considered two cases: complete information (noisy preferences of all the\nagents are entirely known) and partial information (noisy preferences over some\ncoalitions are only known). We introduce a noise model that probabilistically\nscales the valuations of coalitions. The performance metric is the probability\nof our prediction conditioned on all or few noisy preferences of the agents be\ncorrect. The nature of our results is that this prediction probability is\nrelatively low, including being zero, and rarely it is one. In the complete\ninformation two-agent model, in which each agent `retains' or `inflates' the\nvalues of its coalitions, we identify the expressions of the prediction\nprobabilities in terms of the noise probability. We identify the interval of\nthe noise probability such that the prediction probability is at least a\nuser-given threshold. It turned out that, for some noisy games, the noise\nprobability interval does not exist for a threshold as low as 0.1481, thus\ndemonstrating that the prediction probabilities are generally low even in this\nmodel. In the partial information setup, we consider $n$ agent games with $l$\nsupport of noise values, and such noisy preferences are available for some\ncoalitions only.

To fill this gap, we organized a Kaggle\ncompetition where 20 competing teams designed advanced machine learning\npipelines for predicting the brain connectivity evolution from a single\ntimepoint. The competing teams developed their ML pipelines with a combination\nof data pre-processing, dimensionality reduction, and learning methods.\nUtilizing an inclusive evaluation approach, we ranked the methods based on two\ncomplementary evaluation metrics (mean absolute error (MAE) and Pearson\nCorrelation Coefficient (PCC)) and their performances using different training\nand testing data perturbation strategies (single random split and\ncross-validation). The final rank was calculated using the rank product for\neach competing team across all evaluation measures and validation strategies.\nIn support of open science, the developed 20 ML pipelines along with the\nconnectomic dataset are made available on GitHub. The outcomes of this\ncompetition are anticipated to lead to the further development of predictive\nmodels that can foresee the evolution of brain connectivity over time, as well\nas other types of networks (e.g., genetic networks).",

    "abstract": "We present an empirical study of scaling properties of encoder-decoder\nTransformer models used in neural machine translation (NMT). We show that\ncross-entropy loss as a function of model size follows a certain scaling law.\nSpecifically (i) We propose a formula which describes the scaling behavior of\ncross-entropy loss as a bivariate function of encoder and decoder size, and\nshow that it gives accurate predictions under a variety of scaling approaches\nand languages; we show that the total number of parameters alone is not\nsufficient for such purposes. (ii) We observe different power law exponents\nwhen scaling the decoder vs scaling the encoder, and provide recommendations\nfor optimal allocation of encoder/decoder capacity based on this observation.\n(iii) We also report that the scaling behavior of the model is acutely\ninfluenced by composition bias of the train/test sets, which we define as any\ndeviation from naturally generated text (either via machine generated or human\ntranslated text). We observe that natural text on the target side enjoys\nscaling, which manifests as successful reduction of the cross-entropy loss.\n(iv) Finally, we investigate the relationship between the cross-entropy loss\nand the quality of the generated translations. We find two different behaviors,\ndepending on the nature of the test data. For test sets which were originally\ntranslated from target language to source language, both loss and BLEU score\nimprove as model size increases. In contrast, for test sets originally\ntranslated from source language to target language, the loss improves, but the\nBLEU score stops improving after a certain threshold. We release generated text\nfrom all models used in this study.",

    "abstract": "With increased frequency and intensity due to climate change, wildfires have\nbecome a growing global concern. This creates severe challenges for fire and\nemergency services as well as communities in the wildland-urban interface\n(WUI). To reduce wildfire risk and enhance the safety of WUI communities,\nimproving our understanding of wildfire evacuation is a pressing need. To this\nend, this study proposes a new methodology to analyze human behavior during\nwildfires by leveraging a large-scale GPS dataset. This methodology includes a\nhome-location inference algorithm and an evacuation-behavior inference\nalgorithm, to systematically identify different groups of wildfire evacuees\n(i.e., self-evacuee, shadow evacuee, evacuee under warning, and ordered\nevacuee). We applied the methodology to the 2019 Kincade Fire in Sonoma County,\nCA. We found that among all groups of evacuees, self-evacuees and shadow\nevacuees accounted for more than half of the evacuees during the Kincade Fire.\nThe results also show that inside of the evacuation warning/order zones, the\ntotal evacuation compliance rate was around 46% among all the categorized\npeople.

To this end, this work aims\nat three challenges: (i) complex visual observations, (ii) partial\nobservability of local sensing, and (iii) multimodal navigation behaviors that\ndepend on both the local environment and the high-level goal. We propose a\nnovel neural network (NN) architecture to represent a local controller and\nleverage the flexibility of the end-to-end approach to learn a powerful policy.\nTo tackle complex visual observations, we extract multiscale spatial\ninformation through convolution layers. To deal with partial observability, we\nencode rich history information in LSTM-like modules. Importantly, we integrate\nthe two into a single unified architecture that exploits convolutional memory\ncells to track the observation history at multiple spatial scales, which can\ncapture the complex spatiotemporal dependencies between observations and\ncontrols. We additionally condition the network on the high-level goal in order\nto generate different navigation behavior modes. Specifically, we propose to\nuse independent memory cells for different modes to prevent mode collapse in\nthe learned policy. We implemented the NN controller on the SPOT robot and\nevaluate it on three challenging tasks with partial observations: adversarial\npedestrian avoidance, blind-spot obstacle avoidance, and elevator riding. Our\nmodel significantly outperforms CNNs, conventional LSTMs, or the ablated\nversions of our model.

Under\nmild assumptions, asymptotic expressions for the eigenvalues and the\neigenvectors of the channel covariance matrices are derived. We find that, when\nthe channel close to an RIS is correlated, for instance due to small angle\nspread, the communication link benefits significantly from the RIS\noptimization, resulting in gains that are surprisingly higher than the nearly\nuncorrelated case. Furthermore, when the desired reflection from the RIS\ndeparts significantly from geometrical optics, the surface can be optimized to\nprovide robust communication links. Building on the properties of the\neigenvectors of the covariance matrices, we are able to find the optimal\nresponse of the RISs in closed form, bypassing the need for brute-force\noptimization.",

    "abstract": "While the fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC) problems have been\ngreatly developed in the past years, the Ultra-fine-grained visual\ncategorization (Ultra-FGVC) problems have been understudied. FGVC aims at\nclassifying objects from the same species (very similar categories), while the\nUltra-FGVC targets at more challenging problems of classifying images at an\nultra-fine granularity where even human experts may fail to identify the visual\ndifference. The challenges for Ultra-FGVC mainly comes from two aspects: one is\nthat the Ultra-FGVC often arises overfitting problems due to the lack of\ntraining samples; and another lies in that the inter-class variance among\nimages is much smaller than normal FGVC tasks, which makes it difficult to\nlearn discriminative features for each class. To solve these challenges, a\nmask-guided feature extraction and feature augmentation method is proposed in\nthis paper to extract discriminative and informative regions of images which\nare then used to augment the original feature map. The advantage of the\nproposed method is that the feature detection and extraction model only\nrequires a small amount of target region samples with bounding boxes for\ntraining, then it can automatically locate the target area for a large number\nof images in the dataset at a high detection accuracy.

    "abstract": "Safety is of great importance in multi-robot navigation problems. In this\npaper, we propose a control barrier function (CBF) based optimizer that ensures\nrobot safety with both high probability and flexibility, using only sensor\nmeasurement.

With the help of a deep transition model that\npredicts the evolution of surrounding dynamics and the consequences of\ndifferent actions, the CBF module can guide the optimization in a reasonable\ntime horizon. We also present a novel joint training framework that improves\nthe cooperation between the Reinforcement Learning (RL) based policy and the\nCBF-based optimizer both in training and inference procedures by utilizing\nreward feedback from the CBF module. We observe that the policy using our\nmethod can achieve a higher success rate while maintaining the safety of\nmultiple robots in significantly fewer episodes compared with other methods.\nExperiments are conducted in multiple scenarios both in simulation and the real\nworld, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in maintaining\nthe safety of multi-robot navigation.

    "abstract": "Future wireless access networks will support simultaneously a large number of\ndevices with heterogeneous service requirements. These include data rates,\nerror rates, and latencies. While there exist achievable rate and capacity\nresults for Gaussian broadcast channels in the asymptotic regime, the\ncharacterization of second-order achievable rate regions for different\nblocklength constraints are not available. Therefore, we investigate a two-user\nGaussian broadcast channel (GBC) with heterogeneous blocklength constraints\nunder a maximal input power constraint and an average error probability\nconstraint. Unlike the traditional GBC where two users have the same\nblocklength constraints, here the user with higher output SNR has a shorter\nblocklength constraint. We show that with sufficiently large output SNR, the\nstronger user can invoke the technique named early decoding (ED) to decode the\ninterference. Then the successive interference cancellation (SIC) can proceed.\nThis leads to an improved achievable rate region compared to the state of the\nart. To achieve it, we derive an explicit lower bound on the necessary number\nof received symbols for a successful ED, using an independent and identically\ndistributed Gaussian input. A second-order rate of the weaker user who suffers\nfrom an SNR change due to the heterogeneous blocklength constraint, is also\nderived. We then formulate the rate region of the considered setting with\nindividual and also sum power constraints and compare to that of the hybrid\nnon-orthogonal multiple access (HNOMA) scheme. Numerical results show that ED\nhas a larger rate region than HNOMA partly when the gain of the better channel\nis sufficiently larger than the weaker one. Under the considered setting, about\n7-dB SNR gain can be achieved. This makes ED with SIC a promising technique for\nfuture wireless network.",

    "abstract": "In distributed applications, Brewer's CAP theorem tells us that when networks\nbecome partitioned, there is a tradeoff between consistency and availability.\nConsistency is agreement on the values of shared variables across a system, and\navailability is the ability to respond to reads and writes accessing those\nshared variables. We quantify these concepts, giving numerical values to\ninconsistency and unavailability. Recognizing that network partitioning is not\nan all-or-nothing proposition, we replace the P in CAP with L, a numerical\nmeasure of apparent latency, and derive the CAL theorem, an algebraic relation\nbetween inconsistency, unavailability, and apparent latency. This relation\nshows that if latency becomes unbounded (e.g., the network becomes\npartitioned), then one of inconsistency and unavailability must also become\nunbounded, and hence the CAP theorem is a special case of the CAL theorem. We\ndescribe two distributed coordination mechanisms, which we have implemented as\nan extension of the Lingua Franca coordination language, that support arbitrary\ntradeoffs between consistency and availability as apparent latency varies. With\ncentralized coordination, inconsistency remains bounded by a chosen numerical\nvalue at the cost that unavailability becomes unbounded under network\npartitioning. With decentralized coordination, unavailability remains bounded\nby a chosen numerical quantity at the cost that inconsistency becomes unbounded\nunder network partitioning. Our centralized coordination mechanism is an\nextension of techniques that have historically been used for distributed\nsimulation, an application where consistency is paramount. Our decentralized\ncoordination mechanism is an extension of techniques that have been used in\ndistributed databases when availability is paramount.",

So far, this has only\nbeen partially achieved in driverless cars and warehouse installations where\nmarked structures such as roads, lanes, and traffic signs simplify the motion\nplanning and collision avoidance problem. We are presenting a new control\nframework for car-like vehicles that is suitable for virtually any environment.\nIt is based on an unprecedentedly fast-paced A* implementation that allows the\ncontrol cycle to run at a frequency of 33~Hz. Due to an efficient heuristic\nconsisting of rotate-translate-rotate motions laid out along the shortest path\nto the target, our Short Term Aborting A* (STAA*) can be aborted early in order\nto maintain a high and steady control rate. This enables us to place our STAA*\nalgorithm as a low-level replanning controller that is well suited for\nnavigation and collision avoidance in dynamic environments. While our STAA*\nexpands states along the shortest path, it takes care of collision checking\nwith the environment including predicted future states of moving obstacles, and\nreturns the best solution found when the computation time runs out. Despite the\nbounded computation time, our STAA* does not get trapped in environmental\nminima due to the following of the shortest path.

    "abstract": "Researches on dialogue empathy aim to endow an agent with the capacity of\naccurate understanding and proper responding for emotions. Existing models for\nempathetic dialogue generation focus on the emotion flow in one direction, that\nis, from the context to response. We argue that conducting an empathetic\nconversation is a bidirectional process, where empathy occurs when the emotions\nof two interlocutors could converge on the same point, i.e., reaching an\nemotion consensus. Besides, we also find that the empathetic dialogue corpus is\nextremely limited, which further restricts the model performance. To address\nthe above issues, we propose a dual-generative model, Dual-Emp, to\nsimultaneously construct the emotion consensus and utilize some external\nunpaired data. Specifically, our model integrates a forward dialogue model, a\nbackward dialogue model, and a discrete latent variable representing the\nemotion consensus into a unified architecture. Then, to alleviate the\nconstraint of paired data, we extract unpaired emotional data from open-domain\nconversations and employ Dual-Emp to produce pseudo paired empathetic samples,\nwhich is more efficient and low-cost than the human annotation. Automatic and\nhuman evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms competitive baselines\nin producing coherent and empathetic responses.",

Employ the base\ndata to generate a CNN-based feature extraction model (FEM). (2) Meta-test.\nApply the trained FEM to acquire the novel data's features and recognize them.\nFSL relies heavily on the design of the FEM. However, various FEMs have\ndistinct emphases. For example, several may focus more attention on the contour\ninformation, whereas others may lay particular emphasis on the texture\ninformation. The single-head feature is only a one-sided representation of the\nsample. Besides the negative influence of cross-domain (e.g., the trained FEM\ncan not adapt to the novel class flawlessly), the distribution of novel data\nmay have a certain degree of deviation compared with the ground truth\ndistribution, which is dubbed as distribution-shift-problem (DSP). To address\nthe DSP, we propose Multi-Head Feature Collaboration (MHFC) algorithm, which\nattempts to project the multi-head features (e.g., multiple features extracted\nfrom a variety of FEMs) to a unified space and fuse them to capture more\ndiscriminative information. Typically, first, we introduce a subspace learning\nmethod to transform the multi-head features to aligned low-dimensional\nrepresentations. It corrects the DSP via learning the feature with more\npowerful discrimination and overcomes the problem of inconsistent measurement\nscales from different head features. Then, we design an attention block to\nupdate combination weights for each head feature automatically.

To complement existing\nquantitative studies on literature recommendation, we present qualitative study\nresults that report on users' perceptions for two contrasting recommendation\nclasses: (1) link-based recommendation represented by the Co-Citation Proximity\n(CPA) approach, and (2) text-based recommendation represented by Lucene's\nMoreLikeThis (MLT) algorithm.

    "title": "Transductive Learning for Unsupervised Text Style Transfer",
    "abstract": "Unsupervised style transfer models are mainly based on an inductive learning\napproach, which represents the style as embeddings, decoder parameters, or\ndiscriminator parameters and directly applies these general rules to the test\ncases. However, the lacking of parallel corpus hinders the ability of these\ninductive learning methods on this task. As a result, it is likely to cause\nsevere inconsistent style expressions, like `the salad is rude`. To tackle this\nproblem, we propose a novel transductive learning approach in this paper, based\non a retrieval-based context-aware style representation. Specifically, an\nattentional encoder-decoder with a retriever framework is utilized. It involves\ntop-K relevant sentences in the target style in the transfer process. In this\nway, we can learn a context-aware style embedding to alleviate the above\ninconsistency problem. In this paper, both sparse (BM25) and dense retrieval\nfunctions (MIPS) are used, and two objective functions are designed to\nfacilitate joint learning. Experimental results show that our method\noutperforms several strong baselines. The proposed transductive learning\napproach is general and effective to the task of unsupervised style transfer,\nand we will apply it to the other two typical methods in the future.",

    "abstract": "One of the major capacity boosters for 5G networks is the deployment of\nultra-dense heterogeneous networks (UDHNs). However, this deployment results in\ntremendousincrease in the energy consumption of the network due to the large\nnumber of base stations (BSs) involved. In addition to enhanced capacity, 5G\nnetworks must also be energy efficient for it to be economically viable and\nenvironmentally friendly. Dynamic cell switching is a very common way of\nreducing the total energy consumption of the network but most of the proposed\nmethods are computationally demanding which makes them unsuitable for\napplication in ultra-dense network deployment with massive number of BSs. To\ntackle this problem, we propose a lightweight cell switching scheme also known\nas Threshold-based Hybrid cEllswItching Scheme (THESIS) for energy optimization\nin UDHNs. The developed approach combines the benefits of clustering and\nexhaustive search (ES) algorithm to produce a solution whose optimality is\nclose to that of the ES (which is guaranteed tobe optimal), but is\ncomputationally more efficient than ES and as such can be applied for cell\nswitching in real networks even when their dimension is large. The performance\nevaluation shows that the THESIS produces a significant reduction in the energy\nconsumption of the UDHN and is able to reduce the complexity of finding a\nnear-optimal solution from exponential to polynomial complexity.",

This paper investigates a deep\nlearning-based optimization approach of the downlink beamforming to maximize\nthe system sum rate, when only the uplink channel information is available. Our\nmain contribution is to propose a model-driven learning technique that exploits\nthe structure of the optimal downlink beamforming to design an effective hybrid\nlearning strategy with the aim to maximize the sum rate performance. This is\nachieved by jointly considering the learning performance of the downlink\nchannel, the power and the sum rate in the training stage. The proposed\napproach applies to generic cases in which the uplink channel information is\navailable, but its relation to the downlink channel is unknown and does not\nrequire an explicit downlink channel estimation. We further extend the\ndeveloped technique to massive multiple-input multiple-output scenarios and\nachieve a distributed learning strategy for multicell systems without an\ninter-cell signalling overhead. Simulation results verify that our proposed\nmethod provides the performance close to the state of the art numerical\nalgorithms with perfect downlink channel information and significantly\noutperforms existing data-driven methods in terms of the sum rate.",

Moreover, physical synthesis is carried out for this architecture and\na tapeout-ready layout is presented. The estimated dynamic power consumption of\nthe high-frequency architecture is approximately 184mW for key generation and\n187mW for encapsulation or decapsulation operations.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is emerging as tool for tackling complex control\nand decision-making problems. However, in high-risk environments such as\nhealthcare, manufacturing, automotive or aerospace, it is often challenging to\nbridge the gap between an apparently optimal policy learnt by an agent and its\nreal-world deployment, due to the uncertainties and risk associated with it.\nBroadly speaking RL agents face two kinds of uncertainty, 1. aleatoric\nuncertainty, which reflects randomness or noise in the dynamics of the world,\nand 2. epistemic uncertainty, which reflects the bounded knowledge of the agent\ndue to model limitations and finite amount of information/data the agent has\nacquired about the world. These two types of uncertainty carry fundamentally\ndifferent implications for the evaluation of performance and the level of risk\nor trust. Yet these aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties are generally\nconfounded as standard and even distributional RL is agnostic to this\ndifference. Here we propose how a distributional approach (UA-DQN) can be\nrecast to render uncertainties by decomposing the net effects of each\nuncertainty. We demonstrate the operation of this method in grid world examples\nto build intuition and then show a proof of concept application for an RL agent\noperating as a clinical decision support system in critical care",

    "abstract": "Two-sided matching markets have long existed to pair agents in the absence of\nregulated exchanges. A common example is school choice, where a matching\nmechanism uses student and school preferences to assign students to schools. In\nsuch settings, forming preferences is both difficult and critical. Prior work\nhas suggested various prediction mechanisms that help agents make decisions\nabout their preferences. Although often deployed together, these matching and\nprediction mechanisms are almost always analyzed separately. The present work\nshows that at the intersection of the two lies a previously unexplored type of\nstrategic behavior: agents returning to the market (e.g., schools) can attack\nfuture predictions by interacting short-term non-optimally with their matches.\nHere, we first introduce this type of strategic behavior, which we call an\n`adversarial interaction attack'. Next, we construct a formal economic model\nthat captures the feedback loop between prediction mechanisms designed to\nassist agents and the matching mechanism used to pair them. This economic model\nallows us to analyze adversarial interaction attacks. Finally, using school\nchoice as an example, we build a simulation to show that, as the trust in and\naccuracy of predictions increases, schools gain progressively more by\ninitiating an adversarial interaction attack.

This prompted a sharp\nwidespread use of telehealth to provide low-risk care for patients.\nNevertheless, a continuous mutation into new variants and widespread\nunavailability of test kits, especially in developing countries, possess the\nchallenge to control future potential waves of infection. In this paper, we\npropose a novel Smartphone application-based platform for early diagnosis of\npossible Covid-19 infected patients. The application provides three modes of\ndiagnosis from possible symptoms, cough sound, and specific blood biomarkers.\nWhen a user chooses a particular setting and provides the necessary\ninformation, it sends the data to a trained machine learning (ML) model\ndeployed in a remote server using the internet. The ML algorithm then predicts\nthe possibility of contracting Covid-19 and sends the feedback to the user. The\nentire procedure takes place in real-time. Our machine learning models can\nidentify Covid-19 patients with an accuracy of 100%, 95.65%, and 77.59% from\nblood parameters, cough sound, and symptoms respectively. Moreover, the ML\nsensitivity for blood and sound is 100%, which indicates correct identification\nof Covid positive patients. This is significant in limiting the spread of the\nvirus.

We reformulate the\npadding problem as an image extrapolation problem and illustrate the effects on\nthe semantic segmentation task. Using context-aware padding, the ResNet-based\nsegmentation model achieves higher mean Intersection-Over-Union than the\ntraditional zero padding on the Cityscapes and the dataset of DeepGlobe\nsatellite imaging challenge.

    "abstract": "Continual learning refers to the ability of humans and animals to\nincrementally learn over time in a given environment. Trying to simulate this\nlearning process in machines is a challenging task, also due to the inherent\ndifficulty in creating conditions for designing continuously evolving dynamics\nthat are typical of the real-world. Many existing research works usually\ninvolve training and testing of virtual agents on datasets of static images or\nshort videos, considering sequences of distinct learning tasks. However, in\norder to devise continual learning algorithms that operate in more realistic\nconditions, it is fundamental to gain access to rich, fully customizable and\ncontrolled experimental playgrounds. Focussing on the specific case of vision,\nwe thus propose to leverage recent advances in 3D virtual environments in order\nto approach the automatic generation of potentially life-long dynamic scenes\nwith photo-realistic appearance. Scenes are composed of objects that move along\nvariable routes with different and fully customizable timings, and randomness\ncan also be included in their evolution. A novel element of this paper is that\nscenes are described in a parametric way, thus allowing the user to fully\ncontrol the visual complexity of the input stream the agent perceives. These\ngeneral principles are concretely implemented exploiting a recently published\n3D virtual environment. The user can generate scenes without the need of having\nstrong skills in computer graphics, since all the generation facilities are\nexposed through a simple high-level Python interface. We publicly share the\nproposed generator.",

The latest trend of mixed precision quantization takes\nadvantage of hardware's multiple bit-width arithmetic operations to unleash the\nfull potential of network quantization. However, this also results in a\ndifficult integer programming formulation, and forces most existing approaches\nto use an extremely time-consuming search process even with various\nrelaxations.

This approach reduces the search time\nand required data amount by orders of magnitude, with little compromise on\nquantization accuracy.

    "abstract": "Estimating the performance of a machine learning system is a longstanding\nchallenge in artificial intelligence research. Today, this challenge is\nespecially relevant given the emergence of systems which appear to increasingly\noutperform human beings. In some cases, this \"superhuman\" performance is\nreadily demonstrated; for example by defeating legendary human players in\ntraditional two player games. On the other hand, it can be challenging to\nevaluate classification models that potentially surpass human performance.\nIndeed, human annotations are often treated as a ground truth, which implicitly\nassumes the superiority of the human over any models trained on human\nannotations. In reality, human annotators can make mistakes and be subjective.\nEvaluating the performance with respect to a genuine oracle may be more\nobjective and reliable, even when querying the oracle is expensive or\nimpossible. In this paper, we first raise the challenge of evaluating the\nperformance of both humans and models with respect to an oracle which is\nunobserved. We develop a theory for estimating the accuracy compared to the\noracle, using only imperfect human annotations for reference. Our analysis\nprovides a simple recipe for detecting and certifying superhuman performance in\nthis setting, which we believe will assist in understanding the stage of\ncurrent research on classification. We validate the convergence of the bounds\nand the assumptions of our theory on carefully designed toy experiments with\nknown oracles. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of our theory by\nmeta-analyzing large-scale natural language processing tasks, for which an\noracle does not exist, and show that under our assumptions a number of models\nfrom recent years are with high probability superhuman.",

Those solutions usually encode\nhair structures via orientation maps, which, however, are not very effective to\nencode complex structures. We observe that colored hair sketches already\nimplicitly define target hair shapes as well as hair appearance and are more\nflexible to depict hair structures than orientation maps. Based on these\nobservations, we present SketchHairSalon, a two-stage framework for generating\nrealistic hair images directly from freehand sketches depicting desired hair\nstructure and appearance. At the first stage, we train a network to predict a\nhair matte from an input hair sketch, with an optional set of non-hair strokes.\nAt the second stage, another network is trained to synthesize the structure and\nappearance of hair images from the input sketch and the generated matte. To\nmake the networks in the two stages aware of long-term dependency of strokes,\nwe apply self-attention modules to them. To train these networks, we present a\nnew dataset containing thousands of annotated hair sketch-image pairs and\ncorresponding hair mattes. Two efficient methods for sketch completion are\nproposed to automatically complete repetitive braided parts and hair strokes,\nrespectively, thus reducing the workload of users.

In Chinese NER, character substitution is a complicated\nlinguistic phenomenon. Some Chinese characters are quite similar for sharing\nthe same components or having similar pronunciations. People replace characters\nin a named entity with similar characters to generate a new collocation but\nreferring to the same object. It becomes even more common in the Internet age\nand is often used to avoid Internet censorship or just for fun.

To the best\nof our knowledge, this is the first scaling study on dynamic GNN. We devise\nmechanisms for reducing the GPU memory usage and identify two execution time\nbottlenecks: CPU-GPU data transfer; and communication volume. Exploiting\nproperties of dynamic graphs, we design a graph difference-based strategy to\nsignificantly reduce the transfer time. We develop a simple, but effective data\ndistribution technique under which the communication volume remains fixed and\nlinear in the input size, for any number of GPUs. Our experiments using\nbillion-size graphs on a system of 128 GPUs shows that: (i) the distribution\nscheme achieves up to 30x speedup on 128 GPUs; (ii) the graph-difference\ntechnique reduces the transfer time by a factor of up to 4.1x and the overall\nexecution time by up to 40%",

    "abstract": "The crucial problem in vehicle re-identification is to find the same vehicle\nidentity when reviewing this object from cross-view cameras, which sets a\nhigher demand for learning viewpoint-invariant representations. In this paper,\nwe propose to solve this problem from two aspects: constructing robust feature\nrepresentations and proposing camera-sensitive evaluations. We first propose a\nnovel Heterogeneous Relational Complement Network (HRCN) by incorporating\nregion-specific features and cross-level features as complements for the\noriginal high-level output. Considering the distributional differences and\nsemantic misalignment, we propose graph-based relation modules to embed these\nheterogeneous features into one unified high-dimensional space. On the other\nhand, considering the deficiencies of cross-camera evaluations in existing\nmeasures (i.e., CMC and AP), we then propose a Cross-camera Generalization\nMeasure (CGM) to improve the evaluations by introducing position-sensitivity\nand cross-camera generalization penalties. We further construct a new benchmark\nof existing models with our proposed CGM and experimental results reveal that\nour proposed HRCN model achieves new state-of-the-art in VeRi-776, VehicleID,\nand VERI-Wild.",

    "abstract": "Humankind faces many existential threats, but has limited resources to\nmitigate them. Choosing how and when to deploy those resources is, therefore, a\nfateful decision. Here, I analyze the priority for allocating resources to\nmitigate the risk of superintelligences.\nPart I observes that a superintelligence unconnected to the outside world\n(de-efferented) carries no threat, and that any threat from a harmful\nsuperintelligence derives from the peripheral systems to which it is connected,\ne.g., nuclear weapons, biotechnology, etc. Because existentially-threatening\nperipheral systems already exist and are controlled by humans, the initial\neffects of a superintelligence would merely add to the existing human-derived\nrisk. This additive risk can be quantified and, with specific assumptions, is\nshown to decrease with the square of the number of humans having the capability\nto collapse civilization.\nPart II proposes that biotechnology ranks high in risk among peripheral\nsystems because, according to all indications, many humans already have the\ntechnological capability to engineer harmful microbes having pandemic spread.\nProgress in biomedicine and computing will proliferate this threat. ``Savant''\nsoftware that is not generally superintelligent will underpin much of this\nprogress, thereby becoming the software responsible for the highest and most\nimminent existential risk -- ahead of hypothetical risk from\nsuperintelligences.\nThe analysis concludes that resources should be preferentially applied to\nmitigating the risk of peripheral systems and savant software. Concerns about\nsuperintelligence are at most secondary, and possibly superfluous.",

    "abstract": "Online learning is becoming increasingly popular, whether for convenience, to\naccommodate work hours, or simply to have the freedom to study from anywhere.\nEspecially, during the Covid-19 pandemic, it has become the only viable option\nfor learning. The effectiveness of teaching various hard-core programming\ncourses with a mix of theoretical content is determined by the student\ninteraction and responses. In contrast to a digital lecture through Zoom or\nTeams, a lecturer may rapidly acquire such responses from students' facial\nexpressions, behavior, and attitude in a physical session, even if the listener\nis largely idle and non-interactive. However, student assessment in virtual\nlearning is a challenging task. Despite the challenges, different technologies\nare progressively being integrated into teaching environments to boost student\nengagement and motivation. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of\nvarious in-class feedback assessment methods such as Kahoot!, Mentimeter,\nPadlet, and polling to assist a lecturer in obtaining real-time feedback from\nstudents throughout a session and adapting the teaching style accordingly.\nFurthermore, some of the topics covered by student suggestions include tutor\nsuggestions, enhancing teaching style, course content, and other subjects. Any\ninput gives the instructor valuable insight into how to improve the student's\nlearning experience, however, manually going through all of the qualitative\ncomments and extracting the ideas is tedious. Thus, in this paper, we propose a\nsentiment analysis model for extracting the explicit suggestions from the\nstudents' qualitative feedback comments.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, colleges and universities use predictive analytics in a variety of\nways to increase student success rates. Despite the potentials for predictive\nanalytics, there exist two major barriers to their adoption in higher\neducation: (a) the lack of democratization in deployment, and (b) the potential\nto exacerbate inequalities. Education researchers and policymakers encounter\nnumerous challenges in deploying predictive modeling in practice. These\nchallenges present in different steps of modeling including data preparation,\nmodel development, and evaluation. Nevertheless, each of these steps can\nintroduce additional bias to the system if not appropriately performed. Most\nlarge-scale and nationally representative education data sets suffer from a\nsignificant number of incomplete responses from the research participants.\nMissing Values are the frequent latent causes behind many data analysis\nchallenges. While many education-related studies addressed the challenges of\nmissing data, little is known about the impact of handling missing values on\nthe fairness of predictive outcomes in practice.\nIn this paper, we set out to first assess the disparities in predictive\nmodeling outcome for college-student success, then investigate the impact of\nimputation techniques on the model performance and fairness using a\ncomprehensive set of common metrics. The comprehensive analysis of a real\nlarge-scale education dataset reveals key insights on the modeling disparity\nand how different imputation techniques fundamentally compare to one another in\nterms of their impact on the fairness of the student-success predictive\noutcome.",

To\ndemonstrate the use of DISPEL, a 32-bit commercial processor core is\nimplemented using theoretical n-type MoS2 and p-type Black Phosphorous (BP)\nplanar FETs at a projected 5-nm node, and the performance is benchmarked\nagainst Si FinFETs. While the superior gate control of the MoS2/BP FETs can\ntheoretically provide 51% reduction in the iso-frequency energy consumption,\nthe actual performance can be greatly limited by the source/drain contact\nresistances.

    "abstract": "Domain alignment is currently the most prevalent solution to unsupervised\ndomain-adaptation tasks and are often being presented as minimizers of some\ntheoretical upper-bounds on risk in the target domain. However, further works\nrevealed severe inadequacies between theory and practice: we consolidate this\nanalysis and confirm that imposing domain invariance on features is neither\nnecessary nor sufficient to obtain low target risk. We instead argue that\nsuccessful deep domain adaptation rely largely on hidden inductive biases found\nin the common practice, such as model pre-training or design of encoder\narchitecture. We perform various ablation experiments on popular benchmarks and\nour own synthetic transfers to illustrate their role in prototypical\nsituations.

    "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of secure packet routing at the maximum\nachievable rate in a Quantum key distribution (QKD) network. Assume that a QKD\nprotocol generates symmetric private keys for secure communication over each\nlink in a multi-hop network. The quantum key generation process, which is\naffected by noise, is assumed to be modeled by a stochastic counting process.\nPackets are first encrypted with the available quantum keys for each hop and\nthen transmitted on a point-to-point basis over the communication links. A\nfundamental problem that arises in this setting is to design a secure and\ncapacity-achieving routing policy that accounts for the time-varying\navailability of the quantum keys for encryption and finite link capacities for\ntransmission. In this paper, by combining the QKD protocol with the Universal\nMax Weight (UMW) routing policy, we design a new secure throughput-optimal\nrouting policy, called Tandem Queue Decomposition (TQD). TQD solves the problem\nof secure routing efficiently for a wide class of traffic, including unicast,\nbroadcast, and multicast. One of our main contributions in this paper is to\nshow that the problem can be reduced to the usual generalized network flow\nproblem on a transformed network without the key availability constraints.\nSimulation results show that the proposed policy incurs a substantially smaller\ndelay as compared to the state-of-the-art routing and key management policies.\nThe proof of throughput-optimality of the proposed policy makes use of the\nLyapunov stability theory along with a careful treatment of the key-storage\ndynamics.",

In this paper, we propose RetrievalSum, a novel retrieval\nenhanced abstractive summarization framework consisting of a dense Retriever\nand a Summarizer. At first, several closely related exemplars are retrieved as\nsupplementary input to help the generation model understand the text more\ncomprehensively. Furthermore, retrieved exemplars can also play a role in\nguiding the model to capture the writing style of a specific corpus. We\nvalidate our method on a wide range of summarization datasets across multiple\ndomains and two backbone models: BERT and BART. Results show that our framework\nobtains significant improvement by 1.38~4.66 in ROUGE-1 score when compared\nwith the powerful pre-trained models, and achieve new state-of-the-art on\nBillSum.

    "abstract": "Recommender system usually suffers from severe popularity bias -- the\ncollected interaction data usually exhibits quite imbalanced or even\nlong-tailed distribution over items. Such skewed distribution may result from\nthe users' conformity to the group, which deviates from reflecting users' true\npreference. Existing efforts for tackling this issue mainly focus on completely\neliminating popularity bias. However, we argue that not all popularity bias is\nevil. Popularity bias not only results from conformity but also item quality,\nwhich is usually ignored by existing methods. Some items exhibit higher\npopularity as they have intrinsic better property. Blindly removing the\npopularity bias would lose such important signal, and further deteriorate model\nperformance. To sufficiently exploit such important information for\nrecommendation, it is essential to disentangle the benign popularity bias\ncaused by item quality from the harmful popularity bias caused by conformity.\nAlthough important, it is quite challenging as we lack an explicit signal to\ndifferentiate the two factors of popularity bias. In this paper, we propose to\nleverage temporal information as the two factors exhibit quite different\npatterns along the time: item quality revealing item inherent property is\nstable and static while conformity that depends on items' recent clicks is\nhighly time-sensitive. Correspondingly, we further propose a novel Time-aware\nDisEntangled framework (TIDE), where a click is generated from three components\nnamely the static item quality, the dynamic conformity effect, as well as the\nuser-item matching score returned by any recommendation model. Lastly, we\nconduct interventional inference such that the recommendation can benefit from\nthe benign popularity bias while circumvent the harmful one.

Contrary to prior methods that train\nend-to-end deep networks that estimate the vehicles' velocity from the video\npixels, we propose a two-step approach where first an off-the-shelf tracker is\nused to extract vehicle bounding boxes and then a small neural network is used\nto regress the vehicle velocity from the tracked bounding boxes. Surprisingly,\nwe find that this still achieves state-of-the-art estimation performance with\nthe significant benefit of separating perception from dynamics estimation via a\nclean, interpretable and verifiable interface which allows us distill the\nstatistics which are crucial for velocity estimation. We show that the latter\ncan be used to easily generate synthetic training data in the space of bounding\nboxes and use this to improve the performance of our method further.",

    "title": "TruthfulQA: Measuring How Models Mimic Human Falsehoods",
    "abstract": "We propose a benchmark to measure whether a language model is truthful in\ngenerating answers to questions. The benchmark comprises 817 questions that\nspan 38 categories, including health, law, finance and politics. We crafted\nquestions that some humans would answer falsely due to a false belief or\nmisconception. To perform well, models must avoid generating false answers\nlearned from imitating human texts. We tested GPT-3, GPT-Neo/J, GPT-2 and a\nT5-based model. The best model was truthful on 58% of questions, while human\nperformance was 94%. Models generated many false answers that mimic popular\nmisconceptions and have the potential to deceive humans. The largest models\nwere generally the least truthful. For example, the 6B-parameter GPT-J model\nwas 17% less truthful than its 125M-parameter counterpart. This contrasts with\nother NLP tasks, where performance improves with model size. However, this\nresult is expected if false answers are learned from the training distribution.\nWe suggest that scaling up models alone is less promising for improving\ntruthfulness than fine-tuning using training objectives other than imitation of\ntext from the web.",

    "abstract": "With the growing capabilities of autonomous vehicles, there is a higher\ndemand for sophisticated and pragmatic quality assurance approaches for machine\nlearning-enabled systems in the automotive AI context. The use of\nsimulation-based prototyping platforms provides the possibility for early-stage\ntesting, enabling inexpensive testing and the ability to capture critical\ncorner-case test scenarios. Simulation-based testing properly complements\nconventional on-road testing. However, due to the large space of test input\nparameters in these systems, the efficient generation of effective test\nscenarios leading to the unveiling of failures is a challenge. This paper\npresents a study on testing pedestrian detection and emergency braking system\nof the Baidu Apollo autonomous driving platform within the SVL simulator. We\npropose an evolutionary automated test generation technique that generates\nfailure-revealing scenarios for Apollo in the SVL environment. Our approach\nmodels the input space using a generic and flexible data structure and benefits\na multi-criteria safety-based heuristic for the objective function targeted for\noptimization. This paper presents the results of our proposed test generation\ntechnique in the 2021 IEEE Autonomous Driving AI Test Challenge. In order to\ndemonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach, we also report\nthe results from a baseline random generation technique. Our evaluation shows\nthat the proposed evolutionary test case generator is more effective at\ngenerating failure-revealing test cases and provides higher diversity between\nthe generated failures than the random baseline.",

    "abstract": "Spatial symmetries and invariances play an important role in the description\nof materials. When modelling material properties, it is important to be able to\nrespect such invariances. Here we discuss how to model and generate random\nensembles of tensors where one wants to be able to prescribe certain classes of\nspatial symmetries and invariances for the whole ensemble, while at the same\ntime demanding that the mean or expected value of the ensemble be subject to a\npossibly 'higher' spatial invariance class. Our special interest is in the\nclass of physically symmetric and positive definite tensors, as they appear\noften in the description of materials. As the set of positive definite tensors\nis not a linear space, but rather an open convex cone in the linear vector\nspace of physically symmetric tensors, it may be advantageous to widen the\nnotion of mean to the so-called Fr\\'echet mean, which is based on distance\nmeasures between positive definite tensors other than the usual Euclidean one.\nFor the sake of simplicity, as well as to expose the main idea as clearly as\npossible, we limit ourselves here to second order tensors. It is shown how the\nrandom ensemble can be modelled and generated, with fine control of the spatial\nsymmetry or invariance of the whole ensemble, as well as its Fr\\'echet mean,\nindependently in its scaling and directional aspects. As an example, a 2D and a\n3D model of steady-state heat conduction in a human proximal femur, a bone with\nhigh material anisotropy, is explored. It is modelled with a random thermal\nconductivity tensor, and the numerical results show the distinct impact of\nincorporating into the constitutive model different material\nuncertainties$-$scaling, orientation, and prescribed material symmetry$-$on the\ndesired quantities of interest, such as temperature distribution and heat flux.",

    "abstract": "The open domain-dialogue system Alquist has a goal to conduct a coherent and\nengaging conversation that can be considered as one of the benchmarks of social\nintelligence. The fourth version of the system, developed within the Alexa\nPrize Socialbot Grand Challenge 4, brings two main innovations. The first\naddresses coherence, and the second addresses the engagingness of the\nconversation. For innovations regarding coherence, we propose a novel hybrid\napproach combining hand-designed responses and a generative model. The proposed\napproach utilizes hand-designed dialogues, out-of-domain detection, and a\nneural response generator. Hand-designed dialogues walk the user through\nhigh-quality conversational flows. The out-of-domain detection recognizes that\nthe user diverges from the predefined flow and prevents the system from\nproducing a scripted response that might not make sense for unexpected user\ninput. Finally, the neural response generator generates a response based on the\ncontext of the dialogue that correctly reacts to the unexpected user input and\nreturns the dialogue to the boundaries of hand-designed dialogues. The\ninnovations for engagement that we propose are mostly inspired by the famous\nexploration-exploitation dilemma. To conduct an engaging conversation with the\ndialogue partners, one has to learn their preferences and interests --\nexploration. Moreover, to engage the partner, we have to utilize the knowledge\nwe have already learned -- exploitation. In this work, we present the\nprinciples and inner workings of individual components of the open-domain\ndialogue system Alquist developed within the Alexa Prize Socialbot Grand\nChallenge 4 and the experiments we have conducted to evaluate them.",

The LIO subsystem (FAST-LIO) takes advantage of\nthe measurement from LiDAR and inertial sensors and builds the geometry\nstructure of (i.e. the position of 3D points) global maps. The VIO subsystem\nutilizes the data of visual-inertial sensors and renders the map's texture\n(i.e. the color of 3D points). More specifically, the VIO subsystem fuses the\nvisual data directly and effectively by minimizing the frame-to-map photometric\nerror. The developed system R3LIVE is developed based on our previous work\nR2LIVE, with careful architecture design and implementation. Experiment results\nshow that the resultant system achieves more robustness and higher accuracy in\nstate estimation than current counterparts (see our attached video).\nR3LIVE is a versatile and well-engineered system toward various possible\napplications, which can not only serve as a SLAM system for real-time robotic\napplications, but can also reconstruct the dense, precise, RGB-colored 3D maps\nfor applications like surveying and mapping. Moreover, to make R3LIVE more\nextensible, we develop a series of offline utilities for reconstructing and\ntexturing meshes, which further minimizes the gap between R3LIVE and various of\n3D applications such as simulators, video games and etc (see our demos video).\nTo share our findings and make contributions to the community, we open source\nR3LIVE on our Github, including all of our codes, software utilities, and the\nmechanical design of our device.",

At the same time, this\nadaptability raises uncertainties concerning the run-time product quality or\ndependability, such as reliability and security, of these systems. Systems can\nbe tested and monitored, but this does not provide protection against faults\nand failures in adapted ML systems themselves. We studied software designs that\naim at introducing fault tolerance in ML systems so that possible problems in\nML components of the systems can be avoided. The research was conducted as a\ncase study, and its data was collected through five semi-structured interviews\nwith experienced software architects. We present a conceptualisation of the\nmisbehaviour of ML systems, the perceived role of fault tolerance, and the\ndesigns used. Common patterns to incorporating ML components in design in a\nfault tolerant fashion have started to emerge. ML models are, for example,\nguarded by monitoring the inputs and their distribution, and enforcing business\nrules on acceptable outputs. Multiple, specialised ML models are used to adapt\nto the variations and changes in the surrounding world, and simpler fall-over\ntechniques like default outputs are put in place to have systems up and running\nin the face of problems. However, the general role of these patterns is not\nwidely acknowledged.

In recent years, machine\nlearning (ML) techniques have been widely applied for network slicing. However,\nmost existing works do not take advantage of the knowledge transfer capability\nin ML. In this paper, we propose a transfer reinforcement learning (TRL) scheme\nfor joint radio and cache resources allocation to serve 5G RAN slicing.We first\ndefine a hierarchical architecture for the joint resources allocation. Then we\npropose two TRL algorithms: Q-value transfer reinforcement learning (QTRL) and\naction selection transfer reinforcement learning (ASTRL). In the proposed\nschemes, learner agents utilize the expert agents' knowledge to improve their\nperformance on target tasks. The proposed algorithms are compared with both the\nmodel-free Q-learning and the model-based priority proportional fairness and\ntime-to-live (PPF-TTL) algorithms. Compared with Q-learning, QTRL and ASTRL\npresent 23.9% lower delay for Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications slice\nand 41.6% higher throughput for enhanced Mobile Broad Band slice, while\nachieving significantly faster convergence than Q-learning. Moreover, 40.3%\nlower URLLC delay and almost twice eMBB throughput are observed with respect to\nPPF-TTL.",

In this study\nimpactful models are trained on a widely used open-source data and tested on an\nexternal test set and a hospital dataset, for the task of classifying chest\nX-rays into one of three classes: COVID-19, non-COVID pneumonia and\nno-pneumonia. Classification performance of the models investigated is\nevaluated through ROC curves, confusion matrices and standard classification\nmetrics. Explainability modules are implemented to explore the image features\nmost important to classification. Data analysis and model evaluations show that\nthe popular open-source dataset COVIDx is not representative of the real\nclinical problem and that results from testing on this are inflated.

To handle\nthis emerging problem, many fake news detection methods have been proposed,\napplying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques on the article text.\nConsidering that even people cannot easily distinguish fake news by news\ncontent, these text-based solutions are insufficient. To further improve fake\nnews detection, researchers suggested graph-based solutions, utilizing the\nsocial context information such as user engagement or publishers information.\nHowever, existing graph-based methods still suffer from the following four\nmajor drawbacks: 1) expensive computational cost due to a large number of user\nnodes in the graph, 2) the error in sub-tasks, such as textual encoding or\nstance detection, 3) loss of rich social context due to homogeneous\nrepresentation of news graphs, and 4) the absence of temporal information\nutilization. In order to overcome the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel\nsocial context aware fake news detection method, Hetero-SCAN, based on a\nheterogeneous graph neural network. Hetero-SCAN learns the news representation\nfrom the heterogeneous graph of news in an end-to-end manner.

    "abstract": "Many recent literary works have leveraged generative adversarial networks\n(GANs) to spawn unseen evasion samples. The purpose is to annex the generated\ndata with the original train set for adversarial training to improve the\ndetection performance of machine learning (ML) classifiers. The quality\ngeneration of adversarial samples relies on the adequacy of training data\nsamples. Sadly in low data regimes like medical anomaly detection, drug\ndiscovery and cybersecurity, the attack samples are scarce in number. This\npaper proposes a novel GAN design called Evasion Generative Adversarial Network\n(EVAGAN), more suitable for low data regime problems that use oversampling for\ndetection improvement of ML classifiers. EVAGAN not only can generate evasion\nsamples, but its discriminator can act as an evasion aware classifier. We have\nconsidered Auxiliary Classifier GAN (ACGAN) as a benchmark to evaluate the\nperformance of EVAGAN on cybersecurity (ISCX-2014, CIC-2017 and CIC2018) botnet\nand CV (MNIST) datasets. We demonstrate that EVAGAN outperforms ACGAN for\nimbalance datasets regarding detection performance, training stability, time\ncomplexity. EVAGAN's generator quickly learns to generate the low sample class\nand hardens its discriminator simultaneously. In contrast to ML classifiers\nthat require security hardening after being adversarially trained by GAN\ngenerated data, EVAGAN renders it needless. The experimental analysis proves\nEVAGAN to be an efficient evasion hardened model for low data regimes in\ncybersecurity and CV. Code will be available at\nhttps://github.com/rhr407/EVAGAN.",

To attain good\nperformances, the neural network architecture used for a given application must\nbe chosen with care. These architectures are often handcrafted and therefore\nprone to human biases and sub-optimal selection. Neural Architecture Search\n(NAS) is a framework introduced to mitigate such risks by jointly optimizing\nthe network architectures and its weights. Albeit its novelty, it was applied\non complex tasks with significant results - e.g. semantic image segmentation.\nIn this technical paper, we aim to evaluate its ability to tackle a challenging\noperational task: semantic segmentation of objects of interest in satellite\nimagery. Designing a NAS framework is not trivial and has strong dependencies\nto hardware constraints. We therefore motivate our NAS approach selection and\nprovide corresponding implementation details. We also present novel ideas to\ncarry out other such use-case studies.",

However, recommender systems are\noften trained on highly sensitive user data, thus potential data leakage from\nrecommender systems may lead to severe privacy problems.\nIn this paper, we make the first attempt on quantifying the privacy leakage\nof recommender systems through the lens of membership inference. In contrast\nwith traditional membership inference against machine learning classifiers, our\nattack faces two main differences. First, our attack is on the user-level but\nnot on the data sample-level. Second, the adversary can only observe the\nordered recommended items from a recommender system instead of prediction\nresults in the form of posterior probabilities. To address the above\nchallenges, we propose a novel method by representing users from relevant\nitems. Moreover, a shadow recommender is established to derive the labeled\ntraining data for training the attack model. Extensive experimental results\nshow that our attack framework achieves a strong performance. In addition, we\ndesign a defense mechanism to effectively mitigate the membership inference\nthreat of recommender systems.",

Negotiations over\nthe scope of these searches often reflect a fear that something will be missed\n(Fear of Missing Out: FOMO). A Recall level of 80%, for example, means that 20%\nof the relevant documents will be left unproduced. This paper makes the\nargument that eDiscovery is the process of identifying responsive information,\nnot identifying documents. Documents are the carriers of the information; they\nare not the direct targets of the process. A given document may contain one or\nmore topics or factoids and a factoid may appear in more than one document. The\ncoupon collector's problem, Heaps law, and other analyses provide ways to model\nthe problem of finding information from among documents. In eDiscovery,\nhowever, the parties do not know how many factoids there might be in a\ncollection or their probabilities. This paper describes a simple model that\nestimates the confidence that a fact will be omitted from the produced set (the\nidentified set), while being contained in the missed set. Two data sets are\nthen analyzed, a small set involving microaggressions and larger set involving\nclassification of web pages. Both show that it is possible to discover at least\none example of each available topic within a relatively small number of\ndocuments, meaning the further effort will not return additional novel\ninformation.

    "title": "Associative Memories via Predictive Coding",
    "abstract": "Associative memories in the brain receive and store patterns of activity\nregistered by the sensory neurons, and are able to retrieve them when\nnecessary. Due to their importance in human intelligence, computational models\nof associative memories have been developed for several decades now. They\ninclude autoassociative memories, which allow for storing data points and\nretrieving a stored data point $s$ when provided with a noisy or partial\nvariant of $s$, and heteroassociative memories, able to store and recall\nmulti-modal data. In this paper, we present a novel neural model for realizing\nassociative memories, based on a hierarchical generative network that receives\nexternal stimuli via sensory neurons. This model is trained using predictive\ncoding, an error-based learning algorithm inspired by information processing in\nthe cortex. To test the capabilities of this model, we perform multiple\nretrieval experiments from both corrupted and incomplete data points. In an\nextensive comparison, we show that this new model outperforms in retrieval\naccuracy and robustness popular associative memory models, such as autoencoders\ntrained via backpropagation, and modern Hopfield networks. In particular, in\ncompleting partial data points, our model achieves remarkable results on\nnatural image datasets, such as ImageNet, with a surprisingly high accuracy,\neven when only a tiny fraction of pixels of the original images is presented.\nFurthermore, we show that this method is able to handle multi-modal data,\nretrieving images from descriptions, and vice versa. We conclude by discussing\nthe possible impact of this work in the neuroscience community, by showing that\nour model provides a plausible framework to study learning and retrieval of\nmemories in the brain, as it closely mimics the behavior of the hippocampus as\na memory index and generative model.",

This\npaper describes our work to assist non-profits that employ automated messaging\nprograms to deliver timely preventive care information to beneficiaries (new\nand expecting mothers) during pregnancy and after delivery. Unfortunately, a\nkey challenge in such information delivery programs is that a significant\nfraction of beneficiaries drop out of the program. Yet, non-profits often have\nlimited health-worker resources (time) to place crucial service calls for live\ninteraction with beneficiaries to prevent such engagement drops. To assist\nnon-profits in optimizing this limited resource, we developed a Restless\nMulti-Armed Bandits (RMABs) system. One key technical contribution in this\nsystem is a novel clustering method of offline historical data to infer unknown\nRMAB parameters. Our second major contribution is evaluation of our RMAB system\nin collaboration with an NGO, via a real-world service quality improvement\nstudy. The study compared strategies for optimizing service calls to 23003\nparticipants over a period of 7 weeks to reduce engagement drops. We show that\nthe RMAB group provides statistically significant improvement over other\ncomparison groups, reducing ~ 30% engagement drops.

This paper\npresents a zero-shot open information extraction technique that extracts the\nentities (value) and their descriptions (key) from a sentence, using off the\nshelf machine reading comprehension (MRC) Model.

The main objective of this\npaper is to systematically review primary studies that have investigated the\neffects of various human aspects on RE. A systematic literature review (SLR)\nwas conducted and identified 474 initial primary research studies. These were\neventually filtered down to 74 relevant, high-quality primary studies. Among\nthe studies, the effects of communication have been considered in many RE\nstudies. Other human aspects such as personality, motivation and gender have\nmainly been investigated to date related to SE studies including RE as one\nphase. Findings show that studying more than one human aspect together is\nbeneficial, as this reveals relationships between various human aspects and how\nthey together impact the RE process. However, the majority of these studied\ncombinations of human aspects are unique. From 56.8% of studies that identified\nthe effects of human aspects on RE, 40.5% identified the positive impact, 30.9%\nnegative, 26.2% identified both impacts whereas 2.3% mentioned that there was\nno impact. This implies that a variety of human aspects positively or\nnegatively affects the RE process and a well-defined theoretical analysis on\nthe effects of different human aspects on RE remains to be defined and\npractically evaluated. Findings of this SLR help researchers who are\ninvestigating the impact of various human aspects on RE by identifying\nwell-studied research areas, and highlight new areas that should be focused on\nin future research.",

    "title": "Conservative Data Sharing for Multi-Task Offline Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have shown promising results\nin domains where abundant pre-collected data is available. However, prior\nmethods focus on solving individual problems from scratch with an offline\ndataset without considering how an offline RL agent can acquire multiple\nskills. We argue that a natural use case of offline RL is in settings where we\ncan pool large amounts of data collected in various scenarios for solving\ndifferent tasks, and utilize all of this data to learn behaviors for all the\ntasks more effectively rather than training each one in isolation. However,\nsharing data across all tasks in multi-task offline RL performs surprisingly\npoorly in practice. Thorough empirical analysis, we find that sharing data can\nactually exacerbate the distributional shift between the learned policy and the\ndataset, which in turn can lead to divergence of the learned policy and poor\nperformance. To address this challenge, we develop a simple technique for\ndata-sharing in multi-task offline RL that routes data based on the improvement\nover the task-specific data. We call this approach conservative data sharing\n(CDS), and it can be applied with multiple single-task offline RL methods. On a\nrange of challenging multi-task locomotion, navigation, and vision-based\nrobotic manipulation problems, CDS achieves the best or comparable performance\ncompared to prior offline multi-task RL methods and previous data sharing\napproaches.",

    "abstract": "The creation of a large summarization quality dataset is a considerable,\nexpensive, time-consuming effort, requiring careful planning and setup.

Among them, dense phrase retrieval-the most\nfine-grained retrieval unit-is appealing because phrases can be directly used\nas the output for question answering and slot filling tasks. In this work, we\nfollow the intuition that retrieving phrases naturally entails retrieving\nlarger text blocks and study whether phrase retrieval can serve as the basis\nfor coarse-level retrieval including passages and documents. We first observe\nthat a dense phrase-retrieval system, without any retraining, already achieves\nbetter passage retrieval accuracy (+3-5% in top-5 accuracy) compared to passage\nretrievers, which also helps achieve superior end-to-end QA performance with\nfewer passages. Then, we provide an interpretation for why phrase-level\nsupervision helps learn better fine-grained entailment compared to\npassage-level supervision, and also show that phrase retrieval can be improved\nto achieve competitive performance in document-retrieval tasks such as entity\nlinking and knowledge-grounded dialogue. Finally, we demonstrate how phrase\nfiltering and vector quantization can reduce the size of our index by 4-10x,\nmaking dense phrase retrieval a practical and versatile solution in\nmulti-granularity retrieval.",

    "abstract": "While in two-player zero-sum games the Nash equilibrium is a well-established\nprescriptive notion of optimal play, its applicability as a prescriptive tool\nbeyond that setting is limited. Consequently, the study of decentralized\nlearning dynamics that guarantee convergence to correlated solution concepts in\nmultiplayer, general-sum extensive-form (i.e., tree-form) games has become an\nimportant topic of active research. The per-iteration complexity of the\ncurrently known learning dynamics depends on the specific correlated solution\nconcept considered. For example, in the case of extensive-form correlated\nequilibrium (EFCE), all known dynamics require, as an intermediate step at each\niteration, to compute the stationary distribution of multiple Markov chains, an\nexpensive operation in practice. Oppositely, in the case of normal-form coarse\ncorrelated equilibrium (NFCCE), simple no-external-regret learning dynamics\nthat amount to a linear-time traversal of the tree-form decision space of each\nagent suffice to guarantee convergence. This paper focuses on extensive-form\ncoarse correlated equilibrium (EFCCE), an intermediate solution concept that is\na subset of NFCCE and a superset of EFCE. Being a superset of EFCE, any\nlearning dynamics for EFCE automatically guarantees convergence to EFCCE.\nHowever, since EFCCE is a simpler solution concept, this begs the question: do\nlearning dynamics for EFCCE that avoid the expensive computation of stationary\ndistributions exist? This paper answers the previous question in the positive.\nOur learning dynamics only require the orchestration of no-external-regret\nminimizers, thus showing that EFCCE is more akin to NFCCE than to EFCE from a\nlearning perspective. Our dynamics guarantees that the empirical frequency of\nplay after $T$ iteration is a $O(1/\\sqrt{T})$-approximate EFCCE with high\nprobability, and an EFCCE almost surely in the limit.",

Recently, deep\nlearning, which leverages Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to learn deep\nrepresentations of image patterns, has been introduced to the survival\nprediction in various cancers including NPC. It has been reported that\nimage-derived end-to-end deep survival models have the potential to outperform\nclinical prognostic indicators and traditional radiomics-based survival models\nin prognostic performance. However, deep survival models, especially 3D models,\nrequire large image training data to avoid overfitting. Unfortunately, medical\nimage data is usually scarce, especially for Positron Emission\nTomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) due to the high cost of PET/CT\nscanning. Compared to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Computed Tomography\n(CT) providing only anatomical information of tumors, PET/CT that provides both\nanatomical (from CT) and metabolic (from PET) information is promising to\nachieve more accurate survival prediction. However, we have not identified any\n3D end-to-end deep survival model that applies to small PET/CT data of NPC\npatients. In this study, we introduced the concept of multi-task leaning into\ndeep survival models to address the overfitting problem resulted from small\ndata. Tumor segmentation was incorporated as an auxiliary task to enhance the\nmodel's efficiency of learning from scarce PET/CT data. Based on this idea, we\nproposed a 3D end-to-end Deep Multi-Task Survival model (DeepMTS) for joint\nsurvival prediction and tumor segmentation.

Then, we characterize the value function as a viscosity solution to the\nassociated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. Based on the result, we\nderive a necessary and sufficient condition for the $L^0$ optimality, which\nimmediately gives the optimal feedback map. Especially for control-affine\nsystems, we consider the relationship with $L^1$ optimal control problem and\nshow an equivalence theorem.",

    "abstract": "Physical layer security is a useful tool to prevent confidential information\nfrom wiretapping. In this paper, we consider a generalized model of\nconventional physical layer security, referred to as hierarchical information\naccessibility (HIA). A main feature of the HIA model is that a network has a\nhierarchy in information accessibility, wherein decoding feasibility is\ndetermined by a priority of users. Under this HIA model, we formulate a sum\nsecrecy rate maximization problem with regard to precoding vectors. This\nproblem is challenging since multiple non-smooth functions are involved into\nthe secrecy rate to fulfill the HIA conditions and also the problem is\nnon-convex. To address the challenges, we approximate the minimum function by\nusing the LogSumExp technique, thereafter obtain the first-order optimality\ncondition. One key observation is that the derived condition is cast as a\nfunctional eigenvalue problem, where the eigenvalue is equivalent to the\napproximated objective function of the formulated problem. Accordingly, we show\nthat finding a principal eigenvector is equivalent to finding a local optimal\nsolution. To this end, we develop a novel method called generalized power\niteration for HIA (GPI-HIA). Simulations demonstrate that the GPI-HIA\nsignificantly outperforms other baseline methods in terms of the secrecy rate.",

The wireless intelligence empowered by state-of-the-art\nartificial intelligence techniques has been widely considered at the\ntransceivers, and now the paradigm is deemed to be shifted to the smart control\nof radio propagation environment by virtue of RISs. In this article, we argue\nthat to harness the full potential of RISs, localization and communication must\nbe tightly coupled.

In\nthe present study, utterance-level neural confidence measure (NCM) in\nend-to-end automatic speech recognition (E2E ASR) is investigated. The E2E\nsystem adopts the joint CTC-attention Transformer architecture. The prediction\nof NCM is formulated as a task of binary classification, i.e., accept/reject\nthe input utterance, based on a set of predictor features acquired during the\nASR decoding process. The investigation is focused on evaluating and comparing\nthe efficacies of predictor features that are derived from different internal\nand external modules of the E2E system. Experiments are carried out on children\nspeech, for which state-of-the-art ASR systems show less than satisfactory\nperformance and robust confidence measure is particularly useful. It is noted\nthat predictor features related to acoustic information of speech play a more\nimportant role in estimating confidence measure than those related to\nlinguistic information. N-best score features show significantly better\nperformance than single-best ones.

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have promising coverage and data\nrate gains for wireless communication systems in 5G and beyond. Prior work has\nmainly focused on analyzing the performance of these surfaces using computer\nsimulations or lab-level prototypes. To draw accurate insights about the actual\nperformance of these systems, this paper develops an RIS proof-of-concept\nprototype and extensively evaluates its potential gains in the field and under\nrealistic wireless communication settings. In particular, a 160-element\nreconfigurable surface, operating at a 5.8GHz band, is first designed,\nfabricated, and accurately measured in the anechoic chamber. This surface is\nthen integrated into a wireless communication system and the beamforming gains,\npath-loss, and coverage improvements are evaluated in realistic outdoor\ncommunication scenarios. When both the transmitter and receiver employ\ndirectional antennas and with 5m and 10m distances between the transmitter-RIS\nand RIS-receiver, the developed RIS achieves $15$-$20$dB gain in the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in a range of $\\pm60^\\circ$ beamforming angles. In\nterms of coverage, and considering a far-field experiment with a blockage\nbetween a base station and a grid of mobile users and with an average distance\nof $35m$ between base station (BS) and the user (through the RIS), the RIS\nprovides an average SNR improvement of $6$dB (max $8$dB) within an area $>\n75$m$^2$. Thanks to the scalable RIS design, these SNR gains can be directly\nincreased with larger RIS areas. For example, a 1,600-element RIS with the same\ndesign is expected to provide around $26$dB SNR gain for a similar deployment.\nThese results, among others, draw useful insights into the design and\nperformance of RIS systems and provide an important proof for their potential\ngains in real-world far-field wireless communication environments.",

ALT has not been well developed mainly due to\nthe dearth of paired singing voice and lyrics datasets for model training.\nConsidering that there is a large amount of ASR training data, a\nstraightforward method is to leverage ASR data to enhance ALT training.\nHowever, the improvement is marginal when training the ALT system directly with\nASR data, because of the gap between the singing voice and standard speech data\nwhich is rooted in music-specific acoustic characteristics in singing voice. In\nthis paper, we propose PDAugment, a data augmentation method that adjusts pitch\nand duration of speech at syllable level under the guidance of music scores to\nhelp ALT training. Specifically, we adjust the pitch and duration of each\nsyllable in natural speech to those of the corresponding note extracted from\nmusic scores, so as to narrow the gap between natural speech and singing voice.\nExperiments on DSing30 and Dali corpus show that the ALT system equipped with\nour PDAugment outperforms previous state-of-the-art systems by 5.9% and 18.1%\nWERs respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of PDAugment for ALT.",

    "abstract": "Cine cardiac MRI is routinely acquired for the assessment of cardiac health,\nbut the imaging process is slow and typically requires several breath-holds to\nacquire sufficient k-space profiles to ensure good image quality. Several\nundersampling-based reconstruction techniques have been proposed during the\nlast decades to speed up cine cardiac MRI acquisition. However, the\nundersampling factor is commonly fixed to conservative values before\nacquisition to ensure diagnostic image quality, potentially leading to\nunnecessarily long scan times. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end\nquality-aware cine short-axis cardiac MRI framework that combines image\nacquisition and reconstruction with downstream tasks such as segmentation,\nvolume curve analysis and estimation of cardiac functional parameters. The goal\nis to reduce scan time by acquiring only a fraction of k-space data to enable\nthe reconstruction of images that can pass quality control checks and produce\nreliable estimates of cardiac functional parameters. The framework consists of\na deep learning model for the reconstruction of 2D+t cardiac cine MRI images\nfrom undersampled data, an image quality-control step to detect good quality\nreconstructions, followed by a deep learning model for bi-ventricular\nsegmentation, a quality-control step to detect good quality segmentations and\nautomated calculation of cardiac functional parameters. To demonstrate the\nfeasibility of the proposed approach, we perform simulations using a cohort of\nselected participants from the UK Biobank (n=270), 200 healthy subjects and 70\npatients with cardiomyopathies. Our results show that we can produce\nquality-controlled images in a scan time reduced from 12 to 4 seconds per\nslice, enabling reliable estimates of cardiac functional parameters such as\nejection fraction within 5% mean absolute error.",

    "abstract": "Given the Hamiltonian, the evaluation of unitary operators has been at the\nheart of many quantum algorithms. Motivated by existing deterministic and\nrandom methods, we present a hybrid approach, where Hamiltonians with large\namplitude are evaluated at each time step, while the remaining terms are\nevaluated at random. The bound for the mean square error is obtained, together\nwith a concentration bound. The mean square error consists of a variance term\nand a bias term, arising respectively from the random sampling of the\nHamiltonian terms and the operator splitting error. Leveraging on the\nbias/variance trade-off, the error can be minimized by balancing the two. The\nconcentration bound provides an estimate on the number of gates. The estimates\nare verified by using numerical experiments on classical computers.",

    "abstract": "Increasing the resolution of a model can improve the performance of a data\nassimilation system: first because model field are in better agreement with\nhigh resolution observations, then the corrections are better sustained and,\nwith ensemble data assimilation, the forecast error covariances are improved.\nHowever, resolution increase is associated with a cubical increase of the\ncomputational costs. Here we are testing an approach inspired from images\nsuper-resolution techniques and called \"Super-resolution data assimilation\"\n(SRDA). Starting from a low-resolution forecast, a neural network (NN) emulates\na high-resolution field that is then used to assimilate high-resolution\nobservations. We apply the SRDA to a quasi-geostrophic model representing\nsimplified surface ocean dynamics, with a model resolution up to four times\nlower than the reference high-resolution and we use the Ensemble Kalman Filter\ndata assimilation method. We show that SRDA outperforms the low-resolution data\nassimilation approach and a SRDA version with cubic spline interpolation\ninstead of NN. The NN's ability to anticipate the systematic differences\nbetween low and high resolution model dynamics explains the enhanced\nperformance, for example by correcting the difference of propagation speed of\neddies. Increasing the computational cost by 55\\% above the LR data\nassimilation system (using a 25-members ensemble), the SRDA reduces the errors\nby 40\\% making the performance very close to the HR system (16\\% larger,\ncompared to 92\\% larger for the LR EnKF). The reliability of the ensemble\nsystem is not degraded by SRDA.",

    "abstract": "American football is an increasingly popular sport, with a growing audience\nin many countries in the world. The most watched American football league in\nthe world is the United States' National Football League (NFL), where every\noffensive play can be either a run or a pass, and in this work we focus on\npasses. Many factors can affect the probability of pass completion, such as\nreceiver separation from the nearest defender, distance from receiver to\npasser, offense formation, among many others. When predicting the completion\nprobability of a pass, it is essential to know who the target of the pass is.\nBy using distance measures between players and the ball, it is possible to\ncalculate empirical probabilities and predict very accurately who the target\nwill be. The big question is: how likely is it for a pass to be completed in an\nNFL match while the ball is in the air? We developed a machine learning\nalgorithm to answer this based on several predictors. Using data from the 2018\nNFL season, we obtained conditional and marginal predictions for pass\ncompletion probability based on a random forest model. This is based on a\ntwo-stage procedure: first, we calculate the probability of each offensive\nplayer being the pass target, then, conditional on the target, we predict\ncompletion probability based on the random forest model. Finally, the general\ncompletion probability can be calculated using the law of total probability. We\npresent animations for selected plays and show the pass completion probability\nevolution.",

Their complexity means that their dynamics are necessarily\ncomprehended under strong reducing assumptions. It is therefore important to\nhave a clear picture of these reducing assumptions' range of validity. The\nhighly influential chaotic hypothesis of Gallavotti and Cohen states that the\nlarge-scale dynamics of high-dimensional systems are effectively hyperbolic,\nwhich implies many felicitous statistical properties. We demonstrate, contrary\nto the chaotic hypothesis, the existence of non-hyperbolic large-scale dynamics\nin a mean-field coupled system. To do this we reduce the system to its\nthermodynamic limit, which we approximate numerically with a Chebyshev Galerkin\ntransfer operator discretisation. This enables us to obtain a high precision\nestimate of a homoclinic tangency, implying a failure of hyperbolicity. Robust\nnon-hyperbolic behaviour is expected under perturbation. As a result, the\nchaotic hypothesis should not be assumed to hold in all systems, and a better\nunderstanding of the domain of its validity is required.",

    "abstract": "Societies change through time, entailing changes in behaviors and\ninstitutions. We ask how social change occurs when behaviors and institutions\nare interdependent. We model a group-structured society in which the\ntransmission of individual behavior occurs in parallel with the selection of\ngroup-level institutions. We consider a cooperative behavior that generates\ncollective benefits for groups but does not spread between individuals on its\nown. Groups exhibit institutions that increase the diffusion of the behavior\nwithin the group, but also incur a group cost. Groups adopt institutions in\nproportion to their fitness. Finally, cooperative behavior may also spread\nglobally. As expected, we find that cooperation and institutions are mutually\nreinforcing. But the model also generates behavioral source-sink dynamics when\ncooperation generated in institutional groups spreads to non-institutional\ngroups, boosting their fitness. Consequently, the global diffusion of\ncooperation creates a pattern of institutional free-riding that limits the\nevolution of group-beneficial institutions. Our model suggests that, in a\ngroup-structured society, large-scale change in behavior and institutions (i.e.\nsocial change) can be best achieved when the two remain correlated, such as\nthrough the spread successful pilot programs.",

    "abstract": "Holographic displays can generate light fields by dynamically modulating the\nwavefront of a coherent beam of light using a spatial light modulator,\npromising rich virtual and augmented reality applications. However, the limited\nspatial resolution of existing dynamic spatial light modulators imposes a tight\nbound on the diffraction angle. As a result, today's holographic displays\npossess low \\'{e}tendue, which is the product of the display area and the\nmaximum solid angle of diffracted light. The low \\'{e}tendue forces a sacrifice\nof either the field of view (FOV) or the display size. In this work, we lift\nthis limitation by presenting neural \\'{e}tendue expanders. This new breed of\noptical elements, which is learned from a natural image dataset, enables higher\ndiffraction angles for ultra-wide FOV while maintaining both a compact form\nfactor and the fidelity of displayed contents to human viewers. With neural\n\\'{e}tendue expanders, we achieve 64$\\times$ \\'{e}tendue expansion of natural\nimages with reconstruction quality (measured in PSNR) over 29dB on simulated\nretinal-resolution images. As a result, the proposed approach with expansion\nfactor 64$\\times$ enables high-fidelity ultra-wide-angle holographic projection\nof natural images using an 8K-pixel SLM, resulting in a 18.5 mm eyebox size and\n2.18 steradians FOV, covering 85\\% of the human stereo FOV.",

    "abstract": "The perceptual task of speech quality assessment (SQA) is a challenging task\nfor machines to do. Objective SQA methods that rely on the availability of the\ncorresponding clean reference have been the primary go-to approaches for SQA.\nClearly, these methods fail in real-world scenarios where the ground truth\nclean references are not available. In recent years, non-intrusive methods that\ntrain neural networks to predict ratings or scores have attracted much\nattention, but they suffer from several shortcomings such as lack of\nrobustness, reliance on labeled data for training and so on. In this work, we\npropose a new direction for speech quality assessment. Inspired by human's\ninnate ability to compare and assess the quality of speech signals even when\nthey have non-matching contents, we propose a novel framework that predicts a\nsubjective relative quality score for the given speech signal with respect to\nany provided reference without using any subjective data. We show that neural\nnetworks trained using our framework produce scores that correlate well with\nsubjective mean opinion scores (MOS) and are also competitive to methods such\nas DNSMOS, which explicitly relies on MOS from humans for training networks.\nMoreover, our method also provides a natural way to embed quality-related\ninformation in neural networks, which we show is helpful for downstream tasks\nsuch as speech enhancement.",

    "abstract": "We consider adversarial machine learning based attacks on power allocation\nwhere the base station (BS) allocates its transmit power to multiple orthogonal\nsubcarriers by using a deep neural network (DNN) to serve multiple user\nequipments (UEs). The DNN that corresponds to a regression model is trained\nwith channel gains as the input and allocated transmit powers as the output.\nWhile the BS allocates the transmit power to the UEs to maximize rates for all\nUEs, there is an adversary that aims to minimize these rates. The adversary may\nbe an external transmitter that aims to manipulate the inputs to the DNN by\ninterfering with the pilot signals that are transmitted to measure the channel\ngain. Alternatively, the adversary may be a rogue UE that transmits fabricated\nchannel estimates to the BS. In both cases, the adversary carefully crafts\nadversarial perturbations to manipulate the inputs to the DNN of the BS subject\nto an upper bound on the strengths of these perturbations. We consider the\nattacks targeted on a single UE or all UEs. We compare these attacks with a\nbenchmark, where the adversary scales down the input to the DNN. We show that\nadversarial attacks are much more effective than the benchmark attack in terms\nof reducing the rate of communications.
