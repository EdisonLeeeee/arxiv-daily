Our objective is to learn a sequence of sessions incrementally,\nwhere each session only includes a few training instances per class while\npreserving the knowledge of the previously learned ones. SoftNet jointly learns\nthe model weights and adaptive non-binary soft masks at a base training session\nin which each mask consists of the major and minor subnetwork; the former aims\nto minimize catastrophic forgetting during training, and the latter aims to\navoid overfitting to a few samples in each new training session.

    "abstract": "Adversarial training (AT) methods are effective against adversarial attacks,\nyet they introduce severe disparity of accuracy and robustness between\ndifferent classes, known as the robust fairness problem. Previously proposed\nFair Robust Learning (FRL) adaptively reweights different classes to improve\nfairness. However, the performance of the better-performed classes decreases,\nleading to a strong performance drop. In this paper, we observed two unfair\nphenomena during adversarial training: different difficulties in generating\nadversarial examples from each class (source-class fairness) and disparate\ntarget class tendencies when generating adversarial examples (target-class\nfairness). From the observations, we propose Balance Adversarial Training (BAT)\nto address the robust fairness problem. Regarding source-class fairness, we\nadjust the attack strength and difficulties of each class to generate samples\nnear the decision boundary for easier and fairer model learning; considering\ntarget-class fairness, by introducing a uniform distribution constraint, we\nencourage the adversarial example generation process for each class with a fair\ntendency. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10,\nCIFAR-100, and ImageNette) demonstrate that our method can significantly\noutperform other baselines in mitigating the robust fairness problem (+5-10\\%\non the worst class accuracy)",

    "title": "One-Shot Synthesis of Images and Segmentation Masks",
    "abstract": "Joint synthesis of images and segmentation masks with generative adversarial\nnetworks (GANs) is promising to reduce the effort needed for collecting image\ndata with pixel-wise annotations. However, to learn high-fidelity image-mask\nsynthesis, existing GAN approaches first need a pre-training phase requiring\nlarge amounts of image data, which limits their utilization in restricted image\ndomains. In this work, we take a step to reduce this limitation, introducing\nthe task of one-shot image-mask synthesis. We aim to generate diverse images\nand their segmentation masks given only a single labelled example, and\nassuming, contrary to previous models, no access to any pre-training data. To\nthis end, inspired by the recent architectural developments of single-image\nGANs, we introduce our OSMIS model which enables the synthesis of segmentation\nmasks that are precisely aligned to the generated images in the one-shot\nregime. Besides achieving the high fidelity of generated masks, OSMIS\noutperforms state-of-the-art single-image GAN models in image synthesis quality\nand diversity. In addition, despite not using any additional data, OSMIS\ndemonstrates an impressive ability to serve as a source of useful data\naugmentation for one-shot segmentation applications, providing performance\ngains that are complementary to standard data augmentation techniques.

Multi-GPU systems nowadays\nbeing ubiquitous in supercomputers and data-centers present great potentials in\nscaling up large sparse linear algebra kernels. In this work, we design a novel\nsparse matrix representation framework for multi-GPU systems called MSREP, to\nscale sparse linear algebra operations based on our augmented sparse matrix\nformats in a balanced pattern. Different from dense operations, sparsity\nsignificantly intensifies the difficulty of distributing the computation\nworkload among multiple GPUs in a balanced manner. We enhance three mainstream\nsparse data formats -- CSR, CSC, and COO, to enable fine-grained data\ndistribution. We take sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) as an example\nto demonstrate the efficiency of our MSREP framework. In addition, MSREP can be\neasily extended to support other sparse linear algebra kernels based on the\nthree fundamental formats (i.e., CSR, CSC and COO).",

Our method computes\ncontrollers that are also pH (and thus passive) such that the resulting\nclosed-loop systems is again passive, which ensures closed-loop stability\nsimply from the structure of the plant and controller matrices. In this way, we\ncan avoid computationally expensive eigenvalue computations that would\notherwise be necessary. In combination with a sample-based objective function\nwhich allows us to avoid multiple evaluations of the H-infinity norm (which is\ntypically the main computational burden in fixed-order H-infinity controller\nsynthesis), this makes our method well-suited for plants with a high\nstate-space dimension.\nIn our numerical experiments, we show that applying a passivity-enforcing\npost-processing step after using well-established H-infinity synthesis methods\noften leads to a deteriorated H-infinity performance. In constrast to that, our\nmethod computes pH controllers, that are automatically passive and\nsimultaneously aim to minimize the H-infinity norm of the closed-loop transfer\nfunction.

However, in real-world\nscenarios, where entity resolution is part of a more general data project,\ndownstream applications may have varying interpretations of real-world entities\nrelating, for example, to various user needs. In what follows, we introduce the\nproblem of multiple intents entity resolution (MIER), an extension to the\nuniversal (single intent) entity resolution task. As a solution, we propose\nFlexER, utilizing contemporary solutions to universal entity resolution tasks\nto solve multiple intents entity resolution. FlexER addresses the problem as a\nmulti-label classification problem. It combines intent-based representations of\ntuple pairs using a multiplex graph representation that serves as an input to a\ngraph neural network (GNN). FlexER learns intent representations and improves\nthe outcome to multiple resolution problems.

The butterfly species is one of the prominent and a bit\ninsightful in their random flights and converting that into an artificial\nmetaphor would lead to enormous possibilities. This paper considers one such\nmetaphor known as Butterfly Mating Optimization (BMO). In BMO, the Bfly follows\nthe patrolling mating phenomena and simultaneously captures all the local\noptima of multimodal functions. To imitate this algorithm, a mobile robot\n(Bflybot) was designed to meet the features of the Bfly in the BMO algorithm.\nAlso, the multi-Bflybot swarm is designed to act like butterflies in nature and\nfollow the algorithm's rules. The real-time experiments were performed on the\nBMO algorithm in the multi-robotic arena and considered the signal source as\nthe light source. The experimental results show that the BMO algorithm is\napplicable to detect multiple signal sources with significant variations in\ntheir movements i.e., static and dynamic. In the case of static signal sources,\nwith varying initial locations of Bflybots, the convergence is affected in\nterms of time and smoothness.

    "title": "Context-Aware Query Rewriting for Improving Users' Search Experience on  E-commerce Websites",
    "abstract": "E-commerce queries are often short and ambiguous. Consequently, query\nunderstanding often uses query rewriting to disambiguate user-input queries.\nWhile using e-commerce search tools, users tend to enter multiple searches,\nwhich we call context, before purchasing. These history searches contain\ncontextual insights about users' true shopping intents. Therefore, modeling\nsuch contextual information is critical to a better query rewriting model.\nHowever, existing query rewriting models ignore users' history behaviors and\nconsider only the instant search query, which is often a short string offering\nlimited information about the true shopping intent.\nWe propose an end-to-end context-aware query rewriting model to bridge this\ngap, which takes the search context into account. Specifically, our model\nbuilds a session graph using the history search queries and their contained\nwords. We then employ a graph attention mechanism that models cross-query\nrelations and computes contextual information of the session. The model\nsubsequently calculates session representations by combining the contextual\ninformation with the instant search query using an aggregation network. The\nsession representations are then decoded to generate rewritten queries.\nEmpirically, we demonstrate the superiority of our method to state-of-the-art\napproaches under various metrics. On in-house data from an online shopping\nplatform, by introducing contextual information, our model achieves 11.6%\nimprovement under the MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank) metric and 20.1% improvement\nunder the HIT@16 metric (a hit rate metric), in comparison with the best\nbaseline method (Transformer-based model).",

    "abstract": "Several existing works study either adversarial or natural distributional\nrobustness of deep neural networks separately. In practice, however, models\nneed to enjoy both types of robustness to ensure reliability. In this work, we\nbridge this gap and show that in fact, explicit tradeoffs exist between\nadversarial and natural distributional robustness. We first consider a simple\nlinear regression setting on Gaussian data with disjoint sets of core and\nspurious features. In this setting, through theoretical and empirical analysis,\nwe show that (i) adversarial training with $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ norms\nincreases the model reliance on spurious features; (ii) For $\\ell_\\infty$\nadversarial training, spurious reliance only occurs when the scale of the\nspurious features is larger than that of the core features; (iii) adversarial\ntraining can have an unintended consequence in reducing distributional\nrobustness, specifically when spurious correlations are changed in the new test\ndomain. Next, we present extensive empirical evidence, using a test suite of\ntwenty adversarially trained models evaluated on five benchmark datasets\n(ObjectNet, RIVAL10, Salient ImageNet-1M, ImageNet-9, Waterbirds), that\nadversarially trained classifiers rely on backgrounds more than their\nstandardly trained counterparts, validating our theoretical results. We also\nshow that spurious correlations in training data (when preserved in the test\ndomain) can improve adversarial robustness, revealing that previous claims that\nadversarial vulnerability is rooted in spurious correlations are incomplete.",

    "abstract": "Linear computation broadcast (LCBC) refers to a setting with $d$ dimensional\ndata stored at a central server, where $K$ users, each with some prior linear\nside-information, wish to retrieve various linear combinations of the data. The\ngoal is to determine the minimum amount of information that must be broadcast\nto satisfy all the users. The reciprocal of the optimal broadcast cost is the\ncapacity of LCBC. The capacity is known for up to $K=3$ users. Since LCBC\nincludes index coding as a special case, large $K$ settings of LCBC are at\nleast as hard as the index coding problem. Instead of the general setting (all\ninstances), by focusing on the generic setting (almost all instances) this work\nshows that the generic capacity of the symmetric LCBC (where every user has\n$m'$ dimensions of side-information and $m$ dimensions of demand) for large\nnumber of users ($K>d$ suffices) is $C_g=1/\\Delta_g$, where\n$\\Delta_g=\\min\\left\\{\\max\\{0,d-m'\\}, Km, \\frac{dm}{m+m'}\\right\\}$ is the\nbroadcast cost that is both achievable and unbeatable asymptotically almost\nsurely for large $n$, among all LCBC instances with the given parameters\n$p,K,d,m,m'$. Relative to baseline schemes of random coding or separate\ntransmissions, $C_g$ shows an extremal gain by a factor of $K$ as a function of\nnumber of users, and by a factor of $\\approx d/4$ as a function of data\ndimensions, when optimized over remaining parameters. For arbitrary number of\nusers, the generic capacity of the symmetric LCBC is characterized within a\nfactor of $2$.",

To apply traditional machine\nlearning and data analytic techniques to such data it is necessary to transform\ngraphs into vector-based representations that preserve the most essential\nstructural properties of graphs. For this purpose, a large number of graph\nembedding methods have been proposed in the literature. Most of them produce\ngeneral-purpose embeddings suitable for a variety of applications such as node\nclustering, node classification, graph visualisation and link prediction. In\nthis paper, we propose two novel graph embedding algorithms based on random\nwalks that are specifically designed for the node classification problem.\nRandom walk sampling strategies of the proposed algorithms have been designed\nto pay special attention to hubs -- high-degree nodes that have the most\ncritical role for the overall connectedness in large-scale graphs. The proposed\nmethods are experimentally evaluated by analyzing the classification\nperformance of three classification algorithms trained on embeddings of\nreal-world networks.

However, the performance of KD is\naffected by the large capacity gap between the teacher and student networks.\nRecent methods have resorted to a multiple teacher assistant (TA) setting for\nKD, which sequentially decreases the size of the teacher model to relatively\nbridge the size gap between these models.

    "abstract": "Battery life is an increasingly urgent challenge for today's untethered VR\nand AR devices. However, the power efficiency of head-mounted displays is\nnaturally at odds with growing computational requirements driven by better\nresolution, refresh rate, and dynamic ranges, all of which reduce the sustained\nusage time of untethered AR/VR devices. For instance, the Oculus Quest 2, under\na fully-charged battery, can sustain only 2 to 3 hours of operation time. Prior\ndisplay power reduction techniques mostly target smartphone displays. Directly\napplying smartphone display power reduction techniques, however, degrades the\nvisual perception in AR/VR with noticeable artifacts. For instance, the\n\"power-saving mode\" on smartphones uniformly lowers the pixel luminance across\nthe display and, as a result, presents an overall darkened visual perception to\nusers if directly applied to VR content.\nOur key insight is that VR display power reduction must be cognizant of the\ngaze-contingent nature of high field-of-view VR displays. To that end, we\npresent a gaze-contingent system that, without degrading luminance, minimizes\nthe display power consumption while preserving high visual fidelity when users\nactively view immersive video sequences. This is enabled by constructing a\ngaze-contingent color discrimination model through psychophysical studies, and\na display power model (with respect to pixel color) through real-device\nmeasurements. Critically, due to the careful design decisions made in\nconstructing the two models, our algorithm is cast as a constrained\noptimization problem with a closed-form solution, which can be implemented as a\nreal-time, image-space shader. We evaluate our system using a series of\npsychophysical studies and large-scale analyses on natural images. Experiment\nresults show that our system reduces the display power by as much as 24% with\nlittle to no perceptual fidelity degradation.",

    "abstract": "In social networks, a node's position is a form of \\it{social capital}.\nBetter-positioned members not only benefit from (faster) access to diverse\ninformation, but innately have more potential influence on information spread.\nStructural biases often arise from network formation, and can lead to\nsignificant disparities in information access based on position. Further,\nprocesses such as link recommendation can exacerbate this inequality by relying\non network structure to augment connectivity.\nWe argue that one can understand and quantify this social capital through the\nlens of information flow in the network. We consider the setting where all\nnodes may be sources of distinct information, and a node's (dis)advantage deems\nits ability to access all information available on the network. We introduce\nthree new measures of advantage (broadcast, influence, and control), which are\nquantified in terms of position in the network using \\it{access signatures} --\nvectors that represent a node's ability to share information. We then consider\nthe problem of improving equity by making interventions to increase the access\nof the least-advantaged nodes. We argue that edge augmentation is most\nappropriate for mitigating bias in the network structure, and frame a budgeted\nintervention problem for maximizing minimum pairwise access.\nFinally, we propose heuristic strategies for selecting edge augmentations and\nempirically evaluate their performance on a corpus of real-world social\nnetworks. We demonstrate that a small number of interventions significantly\nincrease the broadcast measure of access for the least-advantaged nodes (over 5\ntimes more than random), and also improve the minimum influence.

    "title": "Differentiable Bilevel Programming for Stackelberg Congestion Games",
    "abstract": "A Stackelberg congestion game (SCG) is a bilevel program in which a leader\naims to maximize their own gain by anticipating and manipulating the\nequilibrium state at which followers settle by playing a congestion game.\nLarge-scale SCGs are well known for their intractability and complexity. This\nstudy approaches SCGs through differentiable programming, which marries the\nlatest developments in machine learning with conventional methodologies. The\ncore idea centers on representing the lower-level equilibrium problem using an\nevolution path formed by the imitative logit dynamics. It enables the use of\nautomatic differentiation over the evolution path towards equilibrium, leading\nto a double-loop gradient descent algorithm. We further show the fixation on\nthe lower-level equilibrium may be a self-imposed computational obstacle.\nInstead, the leader may only look ahead along the followers' evolution path for\na few steps, while updating their decisions in sync with the followers through\na co-evolution process. The revelation gives rise to a single-loop algorithm\nthat is more efficient in terms of both memory consumption and computation\ntime. Through numerical experiments that cover a wide range of benchmark\nproblems, we find the single-loop algorithm consistently strikes a good balance\nbetween solution quality and efficiency, outperforming not only the standard\ndouble-loop implementation but also other methods from the literature.\nImportantly, our results highlight both the wastefulness of \"full anticipation\"\nand the peril of \"zero anticipation\". If a quick-and-dirty heuristic is needed\nfor solving a really large SCG, the proposed single-loop algorithm with a\none-step look-ahead makes an ideal candidate.",

The motivating application is\ntime-dependent thermal modeling on vast planetary surfaces, with a focus on\npermanently shadowed craters which receive energy through indirect irradiance.\nIn this setting, shape models are comprised of a large number of triangular\nfacets which conform to a rough surface. At each time step, a quadratic number\nof triangle-to-triangle scattered fluxes must be summed; that is, as the sun\nmoves through the sky, we must solve the same view factor system of equations\nfor a potentially unlimited number of time-varying righthand sides. We first\nconduct numerical experiments with a synthetic spherical cap-shaped crater,\nwhere the equilibrium temperature is analytically available. We also test our\nimplementation with triangle meshes of planetary surfaces derived from digital\nelevation models recovered by orbiting spacecrafts.

    "abstract": "In 1993, Stampe [1993] suggested two \"heurisitic\" filters that were designed\nfor video-oculography data. Several manufacturers (e.g., SR-Research, Tobii T60\nXL and SMI) have employed these filters as an option for recording\neye-movements. For the EyeLink family of eye-trackers, these two filters are\nreferred to as standard (STD) or EXTRA. We have implemented these filters as\nsoftware functions. For those who use their eye-trackers for data-collection\nonly, this will allow users to collect unfiltered data and simultaneously have\naccess to unfiltered, STD filtered and EXTRA filtered data for the exact same\nrecording. Based on the literature, which has employed various eye-tracking\ntechnologies, and our analysis of our EyeLink-1000 data, we conclude that the\nhighest signal frequency content needed for most eye-tracking studies (i.e.,\nsaccades, microsaccades and smooth pursuit) is around 100 Hz, excluding\nfixation microtremor. For those who collect their data at 1000 Hz or higher, we\ntest two zero-phase low-pass digital filters, one with a cutoff of 50 Hz and\none with a cutoff of 100 Hz. We perform a Fourier (FFT) analysis to examine the\nfrequency content for unfiltered data, STD data, EXTRA filtered data, and data\nfiltered by low-pass digital filters. We also examine the frequency response of\nthese filters. The digital filter with the 100 Hz cutoff dramatically\noutperforms both heuristic filters because the heuristic filters leave noise\nabove 100 Hz. In the paper we provide additional conclusions and suggest the\nuse of digital filters in scenarios where offline data processing is an option.",

    "abstract": "Efficient custom pooling techniques that can aggressively trim the dimensions\nof a feature map and thereby reduce inference compute and memory footprint for\nresource-constrained computer vision applications have recently gained\nsignificant traction. However, prior pooling works extract only the local\ncontext of the activation maps, limiting their effectiveness. In contrast, we\npropose a novel non-local self-attentive pooling method that can be used as a\ndrop-in replacement to the standard pooling layers, such as max/average pooling\nor strided convolution. The proposed self-attention module uses patch\nembedding, multi-head self-attention, and spatial-channel restoration, followed\nby sigmoid activation and exponential soft-max. This self-attention mechanism\nefficiently aggregates dependencies between non-local activation patches during\ndown-sampling. Extensive experiments on standard object classification and\ndetection tasks with various convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures\ndemonstrate the superiority of our proposed mechanism over the state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) pooling techniques. In particular, we surpass the test accuracy of\nexisting pooling techniques on different variants of MobileNet-V2 on ImageNet\nby an average of 1.2%. With the aggressive down-sampling of the activation maps\nin the initial layers (providing up to 22x reduction in memory consumption),\nour approach achieves 1.43% higher test accuracy compared to SOTA techniques\nwith iso-memory footprints. This enables the deployment of our models in\nmemory-constrained devices, such as micro-controllers (without losing\nsignificant accuracy), because the initial activation maps consume a\nsignificant amount of on-chip memory for high-resolution images required for\ncomplex vision tasks. Our proposed pooling method also leverages the idea of\nchannel pruning to further reduce memory footprints.",

Many algorithms have been proposed to reduce overestimation, including\nseveral recent ensemble methods, however none have shown success in\nsample-efficient learning through addressing estimation variance as the root\ncause of overestimation. In this paper, we propose MeanQ, a simple ensemble\nmethod that estimates target values as ensemble means. Despite its simplicity,\nMeanQ shows remarkable sample efficiency in experiments on the Atari Learning\nEnvironment benchmark. Importantly, we find that an ensemble of size 5\nsufficiently reduces estimation variance to obviate the lagging target network,\neliminating it as a source of bias and further gaining sample efficiency. We\njustify intuitively and empirically the design choices in MeanQ, including the\nnecessity of independent experience sampling. On a set of 26 benchmark Atari\nenvironments, MeanQ outperforms all tested baselines, including the best\navailable baseline, SUNRISE, at 100K interaction steps in 16/26 environments,\nand by 68% on average.

While there are many research and\nbreeding efforts underway to minimize browning, the progress is hindered by the\nlack of a rapid and reliable methodology to evaluate browning. Current methods\nto identify and quantify browning are either too subjective, labor intensive,\nor inaccurate. In this paper, we report a deep learning model for lettuce\nbrowning prediction. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first-of-its-kind\non deep learning for lettuce browning prediction using a pretrained Siamese\nQuadratic Swin (SQ-Swin) transformer with several highlights. First, our model\nincludes quadratic features in the transformer model which is more powerful to\nincorporate real-world representations than the linear transformer. Second, a\nmulti-scale training strategy is proposed to augment the data and explore more\nof the inherent self-similarity of the lettuce images. Third, the proposed\nmodel uses a siamese architecture which learns the inter-relations among the\nlimited training samples. Fourth, the model is pretrained on the ImageNet and\nthen trained with the reptile meta-learning algorithm to learn higher-order\ngradients than a regular one.

In the past\ndecade, we witnessed dramatic gains in natural language processing and\nunprecedented scaling of large language models. Recent work has characterized\nthe capability of few-shot prompting techniques such as chain of thought to\nemulate human reasoning in large language models. This hallmark feature of\nfew-shot prompting, combined with ever scaling language models, opened a vista\nof possibilities to solve various tasks, such as math word problems, code\ncompletion, and commonsense reasoning. Chain of thought (CoT) prompting further\npushes the performance of models in a few-shot setup, by supplying intermediate\nsteps and urging the model to follow the same process. Despite its compelling\nperformance, the genesis of reasoning capability in these models is less\nexplored.

    "title": "An Extrinsic Calibration Method of a 3D-LiDAR and a Pose Sensor for  Autonomous Driving",
    "abstract": "Accurate and reliable sensor calibration is critical for fusing LiDAR and\ninertial measurements in autonomous driving. This paper proposes a novel\nthree-stage extrinsic calibration method of a 3D-LiDAR and a pose sensor for\nautonomous driving. The first stage can quickly calibrate the extrinsic\nparameters between the sensors through point cloud surface features so that the\nextrinsic can be narrowed from a large initial error to a small error range in\nlittle time. The second stage can further calibrate the extrinsic parameters\nbased on LiDAR-mapping space occupancy while removing motion distortion. In the\nfinal stage, the z-axis errors caused by the plane motion of the autonomous\nvehicle are corrected, and an accurate extrinsic parameter is finally obtained.\nSpecifically, This method utilizes the natural characteristics of road scenes,\nmaking it independent and easy to apply in large-scale conditions. Experimental\nresults on real-world data sets demonstrate the reliability and accuracy of our\nmethod. The codes are open-sourced on the Github website. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first open-source code specifically designed for\nautonomous driving to calibrate LiDAR and pose-sensor extrinsic parameters.

    "title": "Deliberated Domain Bridging for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation",
    "abstract": "In unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), directly adapting from the source to\nthe target domain usually suffers significant discrepancies and leads to\ninsufficient alignment. Thus, many UDA works attempt to vanish the domain gap\ngradually and softly via various intermediate spaces, dubbed domain bridging\n(DB). However, for dense prediction tasks such as domain adaptive semantic\nsegmentation (DASS), existing solutions have mostly relied on rough style\ntransfer and how to elegantly bridge domains is still under-explored. In this\nwork, we resort to data mixing to establish a deliberated domain bridging (DDB)\nfor DASS, through which the joint distributions of source and target domains\nare aligned and interacted with each in the intermediate space. At the heart of\nDDB lies a dual-path domain bridging step for generating two intermediate\ndomains using the coarse-wise and the fine-wise data mixing techniques,\nalongside a cross-path knowledge distillation step for taking two complementary\nmodels trained on generated intermediate samples as 'teachers' to develop a\nsuperior 'student' in a multi-teacher distillation manner. These two\noptimization steps work in an alternating way and reinforce each other to give\nrise to DDB with strong adaptation power. Extensive experiments on adaptive\nsegmentation tasks with different settings demonstrate that our DDB\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

    "title": "Towards A Unified Policy Abstraction Theory and Representation Learning  Approach in Markov Decision Processes",
    "abstract": "Lying on the heart of intelligent decision-making systems, how policy is\nrepresented and optimized is a fundamental problem. The root challenge in this\nproblem is the large scale and the high complexity of policy space, which\nexacerbates the difficulty of policy learning especially in real-world\nscenarios. Towards a desirable surrogate policy space, recently policy\nrepresentation in a low-dimensional latent space has shown its potential in\nimproving both the evaluation and optimization of policy. The key question\ninvolved in these studies is by what criterion we should abstract the policy\nspace for desired compression and generalization. However, both the theory on\npolicy abstraction and the methodology on policy representation learning are\nless studied in the literature. In this work, we make very first efforts to\nfill up the vacancy. First, we propose a unified policy abstraction theory,\ncontaining three types of policy abstraction associated to policy features at\ndifferent levels. Then, we generalize them to three policy metrics that\nquantify the distance (i.e., similarity) of policies, for more convenient use\nin learning policy representation. Further, we propose a policy representation\nlearning approach based on deep metric learning. For the empirical study, we\ninvestigate the efficacy of the proposed policy metrics and representations, in\ncharacterizing policy difference and conveying policy generalization\nrespectively. Our experiments are conducted in both policy optimization and\nevaluation problems, containing trust-region policy optimization (TRPO),\ndiversity-guided evolution strategy (DGES) and off-policy evaluation (OPE).\nSomewhat naturally, the experimental results indicate that there is no a\nuniversally optimal abstraction for all downstream learning problems; while the\ninfluence-irrelevance policy abstraction can be a generally preferred choice.",

    "abstract": "Graph contrastive learning (GCL) is prevalent to tackle the supervision\nshortage issue in graph learning tasks. Many recent GCL methods have been\nproposed with various manually designed augmentation techniques, aiming to\nimplement challenging augmentations on the original graph to yield robust\nrepresentation. Although many of them achieve remarkable performances, existing\nGCL methods still struggle to improve model robustness without risking losing\ntask-relevant information because they ignore the fact the augmentation-induced\nlatent factors could be highly entangled with the original graph, thus it is\nmore difficult to discriminate the task-relevant information from irrelevant\ninformation. Consequently, the learned representation is either brittle or\nunilluminating. In light of this, we introduce the Adversarial Cross-View\nDisentangled Graph Contrastive Learning (ACDGCL), which follows the information\nbottleneck principle to learn minimal yet sufficient representations from graph\ndata. To be specific, our proposed model elicits the augmentation-invariant and\naugmentation-dependent factors separately. Except for the conventional\ncontrastive loss which guarantees the consistency and sufficiency of the\nrepresentations across different contrastive views, we introduce a cross-view\nreconstruction mechanism to pursue the representation disentanglement. Besides,\nan adversarial view is added as the third view of contrastive loss to enhance\nmodel robustness. We empirically demonstrate that our proposed model\noutperforms the state-of-the-arts on graph classification task over multiple\nbenchmark datasets.",

However, traditional Gradient-Descent based methods fail to solve\nproblems which contains objective functions with L1 regularization, such as\nLasso regression. In this paper, we present Federated Coordinate Descent, a new\ndistributed scheme called FCD, to address this issue securely under multiparty\nscenarios. Specifically, through secure aggregation and added perturbations,\nour scheme guarantees that: (1) no local information is leaked to other\nparties, and (2) global model parameters are not exposed to cloud servers. The\nadded perturbations can eventually be eliminated by each party to derive a\nglobal model with high performance. We show that the FCD scheme fills the gap\nof multiparty secure Coordinate Descent methods and is applicable for general\nlinear regressions, including linear, ridge and lasso regressions. Theoretical\nsecurity analysis and experimental results demonstrate that FCD can be\nperformed effectively and efficiently, and provide as low MAE measure as\ncentralized methods under tasks of three types of linear regressions on\nreal-world UCI datasets.",

However, most of\nthem simply replace vanilla convolutions with stacked separable convolutions,\nwhich may not be efficient due to a lot of precision losses and may not be able\nto detect oriented bounding boxes (OBB). Also, the existing OBB detection\nmethods are difficult to constrain the shape of objects predicted by CNNs\naccurately. In this paper, we propose an effective lightweight oriented object\ndetector (LO-Det). Specifically, a channel separation-aggregation (CSA)\nstructure is designed to simplify the complexity of stacked separable\nconvolutions, and a dynamic receptive field (DRF) mechanism is developed to\nmaintain high accuracy by customizing the convolution kernel and its perception\nrange dynamically when reducing the network complexity. The CSA-DRF component\noptimizes efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. Then, a diagonal support\nconstraint head (DSC-Head) component is designed to detect OBBs and constrain\ntheir shapes more accurately and stably.

    "title": "Enhance the Visual Representation via Discrete Adversarial Training",
    "abstract": "Adversarial Training (AT), which is commonly accepted as one of the most\neffective approaches defending against adversarial examples, can largely harm\nthe standard performance, thus has limited usefulness on industrial-scale\nproduction and applications. Surprisingly, this phenomenon is totally opposite\nin Natural Language Processing (NLP) task, where AT can even benefit for\ngeneralization. We notice the merit of AT in NLP tasks could derive from the\ndiscrete and symbolic input space. For borrowing the advantage from NLP-style\nAT, we propose Discrete Adversarial Training (DAT). DAT leverages VQGAN to\nreform the image data to discrete text-like inputs, i.e. visual words. Then it\nminimizes the maximal risk on such discrete images with symbolic adversarial\nperturbations. We further give an explanation from the perspective of\ndistribution to demonstrate the effectiveness of DAT. As a plug-and-play\ntechnique for enhancing the visual representation, DAT achieves significant\nimprovement on multiple tasks including image classification, object detection\nand self-supervised learning. Especially, the model pre-trained with Masked\nAuto-Encoding (MAE) and fine-tuned by our DAT without extra data can get 31.40\nmCE on ImageNet-C and 32.77% top-1 accuracy on Stylized-ImageNet, building the\nnew state-of-the-art.

    "abstract": "Neural tangent kernel (NTK) is a powerful tool to analyze training dynamics\nof neural networks and their generalization bounds. The study on NTK has been\ndevoted to typical neural network architectures, but is incomplete for neural\nnetworks with Hadamard products (NNs-Hp), e.g., StyleGAN and polynomial neural\nnetworks. In this work, we derive the finite-width NTK formulation for a\nspecial class of NNs-Hp, i.e., polynomial neural networks. We prove their\nequivalence to the kernel regression predictor with the associated NTK, which\nexpands the application scope of NTK. Based on our results, we elucidate the\nseparation of PNNs over standard neural networks with respect to extrapolation\nand spectral bias. Our two key insights are that when compared to standard\nneural networks, PNNs are able to fit more complicated functions in the\nextrapolation regime and admit a slower eigenvalue decay of the respective NTK.\nBesides, our theoretical results can be extended to other types of NNs-Hp,\nwhich expand the scope of our work. Our empirical results validate the\nseparations in broader classes of NNs-Hp, which provide a good justification\nfor a deeper understanding of neural architectures.",

In this paper, we propose a highly feasible framework for\nautomatically building a marking-level HD map using a simple sensor setup (one\nor more monocular cameras). We optimize the position of the marking corners to\nfit the result of marking segmentation and simultaneously optimize the inverse\nperspective mapping (IPM) matrix of the corresponding camera to obtain an\naccurate transformation from the front view image to the bird's-eye view (BEV).\nIn the quantitative evaluation, the built HD map almost attains\ncentimeter-level accuracy.

    "abstract": "Vision transformers have shown excellent performance in computer vision\ntasks. However, the computation cost of their (local) self-attention mechanism\nis expensive. Comparatively, CNN is more efficient with built-in inductive\nbias. Recent works show that CNN is promising to compete with vision\ntransformers by learning their architecture design and training protocols.\nNevertheless, existing methods either ignore multi-level features or lack\ndynamic prosperity, leading to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we\npropose a novel attention mechanism named MCA, which captures different\npatterns of input images by multiple kernel sizes and enables input-adaptive\nweights with a gating mechanism. Based on MCA, we present a neural network\nnamed ConvFormer. ConvFormer adopts the general architecture of vision\ntransformers, while replacing the (local) self-attention mechanism with our\nproposed MCA. Extensive experimental results demonstrated that ConvFormer\noutperforms similar size vision transformers(ViTs) and convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) in various tasks. For example, ConvFormer-S, ConvFormer-L\nachieve state-of-the-art performance of 82.8%, 83.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet\ndataset.

    "abstract": "In order to replace fossil fuels with the use of renewable energy resources,\nunbalanced resource production of intermittent wind and photovoltaic (PV) power\nis a critical issue for peer-to-peer (P2P) power trading. To resolve this\nproblem, a reinforcement learning (RL) technique is introduced in this paper.\nFor RL, graph convolutional network (GCN) and bi-directional long short-term\nmemory (Bi-LSTM) network are jointly applied to P2P power trading between\nnanogrid clusters based on cooperative game theory. The flexible and reliable\nDC nanogrid is suitable to integrate renewable energy for distribution system.\nEach local nanogrid cluster takes the position of prosumer, focusing on power\nproduction and consumption simultaneously. For the power management of nanogrid\nclusters, multi-objective optimization is applied to each local nanogrid\ncluster with the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Charging/discharging of\nelectric vehicle (EV) is performed considering the intermittent characteristics\nof wind and PV power production. RL algorithms, such as deep Q-learning network\n(DQN), deep recurrent Q-learning network (DRQN), Bi-DRQN, proximal policy\noptimization (PPO), GCN-DQN, GCN-DRQN, GCN-Bi-DRQN, and GCN-PPO, are used for\nsimulations. Consequently, the cooperative P2P power trading system maximizes\nthe profit utilizing the time of use (ToU) tariff-based electricity cost and\nsystem marginal price (SMP), and minimizes the amount of grid power\nconsumption. Power management of nanogrid clusters with P2P power trading is\nsimulated on the distribution test feeder in real-time and proposed GCN-PPO\ntechnique reduces the electricity cost of nanogrid clusters by 36.7%.",

However, randomized experiments are often\ntime-consuming, expensive, risky, infeasible or unethical to perform, leaving\ndecision makers little choice but to rely on observational data collected under\nhistorical policies when training models. This opens questions regarding not\nonly which decision-making policies would perform best in practice, but also\nregarding the impact of different data collection protocols on the performance\nof various policies trained on the data, or the robustness of policy\nperformance with respect to changes in problem characteristics such as action-\nor reward- specific delays in observing outcomes. We aim to answer such\nquestions for the problem of optimizing sales channel allocations at LinkedIn,\nwhere sales accounts (leads) need to be allocated to one of three channels,\nwith the goal of maximizing the number of successful conversions over a period\nof time. A key problem feature constitutes the presence of stochastic delays in\nobserving allocation outcomes, whose distribution is both channel- and outcome-\ndependent.

When provided as\ninput several example language commands (formatted as comments) followed by\ncorresponding policy code (via few-shot prompting), LLMs can take in new\ncommands and autonomously re-compose API calls to generate new policy code\nrespectively. By chaining classic logic structures and referencing third-party\nlibraries (e.g., NumPy, Shapely) to perform arithmetic, LLMs used in this way\ncan write robot policies that (i) exhibit spatial-geometric reasoning, (ii)\ngeneralize to new instructions, and (iii) prescribe precise values (e.g.,\nvelocities) to ambiguous descriptions (\"faster\") depending on context (i.e.,\nbehavioral commonsense).

To tackle with this issue, this paper proposes an Expansion and Shrinkage\nscheme based on the offset learning in the deformable convolution, to\nsequentially improve the recall and precision of the located object in the two\nrespective stages. In the Expansion stage, an offset learning branch in a\ndeformable convolution layer, referred as \"expansion sampler\" seeks for\nsampling increasingly less discriminative object regions, driven by an inverse\nsupervision signal that maximizes image-level classification loss. The located\nmore complete object in the Expansion stage is then gradually narrowed down to\nthe final object region during the Shrinkage stage. In the Shrinkage stage, the\noffset learning branch of another deformable convolution layer, referred as\n\"shrinkage sampler\", is introduced to exclude the false positive background\nregions attended in the Expansion stage to improve the precision of the\nlocalization maps. We conduct various experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS\nCOCO 2014 to well demonstrate the superiority of our method over other\nstate-of-the-art methods for weakly-supervised semantic segmentation.

    "abstract": "Occupancy mapping has been widely utilized to represent the surroundings for\nautonomous robots to perform tasks such as navigation and manipulation. While\noccupancy mapping in 2-D environments has been well-studied, there have been\nfew approaches suitable for 3-D dynamic occupancy mapping which is essential\nfor aerial robots. This paper presents a novel 3-D dynamic occupancy mapping\nalgorithm called DSK3DOM. We first establish a Bayesian method to sequentially\nupdate occupancy maps for a stream of measurements based on the random finite\nset theory. Then, we approximate it with particles in the Dempster-Shafer\ndomain to enable real time computation. Moreover, the algorithm applies kernel\nbased inference with Dirichlet basic belief assignment to enable dense mapping\nfrom sparse measurements. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is\ndemonstrated through simulations and real experiments.",

We consider a vehicle model with parameter\nuncertainties and external disturbances and propose a distributed control law\nbased on an event-triggered extended state observer (ESO).

The control law of each follower vehicle only uses the information\nobtained by on-board sensors, including its own velocity, acceleration, the\nvelocity of the preceding vehicle and the inter-vehicle distance. Finally, we\ngive the range of the control parameters to ensure the stability of the vehicle\nplatoon system.

    "abstract": "Weakly supervised point cloud semantic segmentation methods that require 1\\%\nor fewer labels, hoping to realize almost the same performance as fully\nsupervised approaches, which recently, have attracted extensive research\nattention. A typical solution in this framework is to use self-training or\npseudo labeling to mine the supervision from the point cloud itself, but ignore\nthe critical information from images. In fact, cameras widely exist in LiDAR\nscenarios and this complementary information seems to be greatly important for\n3D applications. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-modality weakly\nsupervised method for 3D segmentation, incorporating complementary information\nfrom unlabeled images. Basically, we design a dual-branch network equipped with\nan active labeling strategy, to maximize the power of tiny parts of labels and\ndirectly realize 2D-to-3D knowledge transfer. Afterwards, we establish a\ncross-modal self-training framework in an Expectation-Maximum (EM) perspective,\nwhich iterates between pseudo labels estimation and parameters updating. In the\nM-Step, we propose a cross-modal association learning to mine complementary\nsupervision from images by reinforcing the cycle-consistency between 3D points\nand 2D superpixels. In the E-step, a pseudo label self-rectification mechanism\nis derived to filter noise labels thus providing more accurate labels for the\nnetworks to get fully trained. The extensive experimental results demonstrate\nthat our method even outperforms the state-of-the-art fully supervised\ncompetitors with less than 1\\% actively selected annotations.",

The main intuition of PointCAT is\nencouraging the target recognition model to narrow the decision gap between\nclean point clouds and corrupted point clouds. Specifically, we leverage a\nsupervised contrastive loss to facilitate the alignment and uniformity of the\nhypersphere features extracted by the recognition model, and design a pair of\ncentralizing losses with the dynamic prototype guidance to avoid these features\ndeviating from their belonging category clusters. To provide the more\nchallenging corrupted point clouds, we adversarially train a noise generator\nalong with the recognition model from the scratch, instead of using\ngradient-based attack as the inner loop like previous adversarial training\nmethods. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed PointCAT outperforms\nthe baseline methods and dramatically boosts the robustness of different point\ncloud recognition models, under a variety of corruptions including isotropic\npoint noises, the LiDAR simulated noises, random point dropping and adversarial\nperturbations.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that detectors based on deep models are vulnerable\nto adversarial examples, even in the black-box scenario where the attacker\ncannot access the model information. Most existing attack methods aim to\nminimize the true positive rate, which often shows poor attack performance, as\nanother sub-optimal bounding box may be detected around the attacked bounding\nbox to be the new true positive one. To settle this challenge, we propose to\nminimize the true positive rate and maximize the false positive rate, which can\nencourage more false positive objects to block the generation of new true\npositive bounding boxes. It is modeled as a multi-objective optimization (MOP)\nproblem, of which the generic algorithm can search the Pareto-optimal.

Thus, we extend the standard Genetic Algorithm with Random Subset\nselection and Divide-and-Conquer, called GARSDC, which significantly improves\nthe efficiency. Moreover, to alleviate the sensitivity to population quality in\ngeneric algorithms, we generate a gradient-prior initial population, utilizing\nthe transferability between different detectors with similar backbones.\nCompared with the state-of-art attack methods, GARSDC decreases by an average\n12.0 in the mAP and queries by about 1000 times in extensive experiments.

Many deep\nlearning models have been proposed to conduct clinical predictive tasks such as\nmortality prediction for COVID-19 patients in intensive care units using\nElectronic Health Record (EHR) data.

    "abstract": "In this work, we present a novel learning-based framework that combines the\nlocal accuracy of contrastive learning with the global consistency of geometric\napproaches, for robust non-rigid matching. We first observe that while\ncontrastive learning can lead to powerful point-wise features, the learned\ncorrespondences commonly lack smoothness and consistency, owing to the purely\ncombinatorial nature of the standard contrastive losses. To overcome this\nlimitation we propose to boost contrastive feature learning with two types of\nsmoothness regularization that inject geometric information into correspondence\nlearning. With this novel combination in hand, the resulting features are both\nhighly discriminative across individual points, and, at the same time, lead to\nrobust and consistent correspondences, through simple proximity queries. Our\nframework is general and is applicable to local feature learning in both the 3D\nand 2D domains.

    "title": "Model Inversion Attacks against Graph Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Many data mining tasks rely on graphs to model relational structures among\nindividuals (nodes). Since relational data are often sensitive, there is an\nurgent need to evaluate the privacy risks in graph data. One famous privacy\nattack against data analysis models is the model inversion attack, which aims\nto infer sensitive data in the training dataset and leads to great privacy\nconcerns. Despite its success in grid-like domains, directly applying model\ninversion attacks on non-grid domains such as graph leads to poor attack\nperformance. This is mainly due to the failure to consider the unique\nproperties of graphs. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic study on\nmodel inversion attacks against Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), one of the\nstate-of-the-art graph analysis tools in this paper. Firstly, in the white-box\nsetting where the attacker has full access to the target GNN model, we present\nGraphMI to infer the private training graph data. Specifically, in GraphMI, a\nprojected gradient module is proposed to tackle the discreteness of graph edges\nand preserve the sparsity and smoothness of graph features; a graph\nauto-encoder module is used to efficiently exploit graph topology, node\nattributes, and target model parameters for edge inference; a random sampling\nmodule can finally sample discrete edges. Furthermore, in the hard-label\nblack-box setting where the attacker can only query the GNN API and receive the\nclassification results, we propose two methods based on gradient estimation and\nreinforcement learning (RL-GraphMI). Our experimental results show that such\ndefenses are not sufficiently effective and call for more advanced defenses\nagainst privacy attacks.",

    "abstract": "While self-supervised learning techniques are often used to mining implicit\nknowledge from unlabeled data via modeling multiple views, it is unclear how to\nperform effective representation learning in a complex and inconsistent\ncontext. To this end, we propose a methodology, specifically consistency and\ncomplementarity network (CoCoNet), which avails of strict global inter-view\nconsistency and local cross-view complementarity preserving regularization to\ncomprehensively learn representations from multiple views. On the global stage,\nwe reckon that the crucial knowledge is implicitly shared among views, and\nenhancing the encoder to capture such knowledge from data can improve the\ndiscriminability of the learned representations. Hence, preserving the global\nconsistency of multiple views ensures the acquisition of common knowledge.\nCoCoNet aligns the probabilistic distribution of views by utilizing an\nefficient discrepancy metric measurement based on the generalized sliced\nWasserstein distance. Lastly on the local stage, we propose a heuristic\ncomplementarity-factor, which joints cross-view discriminative knowledge, and\nit guides the encoders to learn not only view-wise discriminability but also\ncross-view complementary information. Theoretically, we provide the\ninformation-theoretical-based analyses of our proposed CoCoNet. Empirically, to\ninvestigate the improvement gains of our approach, we conduct adequate\nexperimental validations, which demonstrate that CoCoNet outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art self-supervised methods by a significant margin proves that\nsuch implicit consistency and complementarity preserving regularization can\nenhance the discriminability of latent representations.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we study estimating Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) in the\ncase where the agents (individuals) are strategic or self-interested and they\nconcern about their privacy when reporting data. Compared with the classical\nsetting, here we aim to design mechanisms that can both incentivize most agents\nto truthfully report their data and preserve the privacy of individuals'\nreports, while their outputs should also close to the underlying parameter. In\nthe first part of the paper, we consider the case where the covariates are\nsub-Gaussian and the responses are heavy-tailed where they only have the finite\nfourth moments. First, motivated by the stationary condition of the maximizer\nof the likelihood function, we derive a novel private and closed form\nestimator. Based on the estimator, we propose a mechanism which has the\nfollowing properties via some appropriate design of the computation and payment\nscheme for several canonical models such as linear regression, logistic\nregression and Poisson regression: (1) the mechanism is $o(1)$-jointly\ndifferentially private (with probability at least $1-o(1)$); (2) it is an\n$o(\\frac{1}{n})$-approximate Bayes Nash equilibrium for a $(1-o(1))$-fraction\nof agents to truthfully report their data, where $n$ is the number of agents;\n(3) the output could achieve an error of $o(1)$ to the underlying parameter;\n(4) it is individually rational for a $(1-o(1))$ fraction of agents in the\nmechanism ; (5) the payment budget required from the analyst to run the\nmechanism is $o(1)$. In the second part, we consider the linear regression\nmodel under more general setting where both covariates and responses are\nheavy-tailed and only have finite fourth moments.

For the graph-level representation,\nit is important to learn both representation of neighboring nodes, i.e.,\naggregation, and graph structural information. A number of graph pooling\nmethods have been developed for this goal.

In this paper, we propose Structure\nPrototype Guided Pooling (SPGP) that utilizes prior graph structures to\novercome the limitation.

    "abstract": "With the success of contextualized language models, much research explores\nwhat these models really learn and in which cases they still fail. Most of this\nwork focuses on specific NLP tasks and on the learning outcome. Little research\nhas attempted to decouple the models' weaknesses from specific tasks and focus\non the embeddings per se and their mode of learning. In this paper, we take up\nthis research opportunity: based on theoretical linguistic insights, we explore\nwhether the semantic constraints of function words are learned and how the\nsurrounding context impacts their embeddings. We create suitable datasets,\nprovide new insights into the inner workings of LMs vis-a-vis function words\nand implement an assisting visual web interface for qualitative analysis.",

    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is the key to deploying models safely in\nthe open world. For OOD detection, collecting sufficient in-distribution (ID)\nlabeled data is usually more time-consuming and costly than unlabeled data.\nWhen ID labeled data is limited, the previous OOD detection methods are no\nlonger superior due to their high dependence on the amount of ID labeled data.\nBased on limited ID labeled data and sufficient unlabeled data, we define a new\nsetting called Weakly-Supervised Out-of-Distribution Detection (WSOOD). To\nsolve the new problem, we propose an effective method called Topological\nStructure Learning (TSL). Firstly, TSL uses a contrastive learning method to\nbuild the initial topological structure space for ID and OOD data. Secondly,\nTSL mines effective topological connections in the initial topological space.\nFinally, based on limited ID labeled data and mined topological connections,\nTSL reconstructs the topological structure in a new topological space to\nincrease the separability of ID and OOD instances. Extensive studies on several\nrepresentative datasets show that TSL remarkably outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art, verifying the validity and robustness of our method in the\nnew setting of WSOOD.",

Yet, an open challenge remains on how to apply FES to achieve desired\nmovements. This challenge is accentuated by the complexities of human bodies\nand the non-stationarities of the muscles' responses. The former causes\ndifficulties in performing inverse dynamics, and the latter causes control\nperformance to degrade over extended periods of use. Here, we engage the\nchallenge via a data-driven approach. Specifically, we learn to control FES\nthrough Reinforcement Learning (RL) which can automatically customise the\nstimulation for the patients. However, RL typically has Markovian assumptions\nwhile FES control systems are non-Markovian because of the non-stationarities.\nTo deal with this problem, we use a recurrent neural network to create\nMarkovian state representations. We cast FES controls into RL problems and\ntrain RL agents to control FES in different settings in both simulations and\nthe real world.

We make three main contributions. First, we investigate\nscaling behaviors for red teaming across 3 model sizes (2.7B, 13B, and 52B\nparameters) and 4 model types: a plain language model (LM); an LM prompted to\nbe helpful, honest, and harmless; an LM with rejection sampling; and a model\ntrained to be helpful and harmless using reinforcement learning from human\nfeedback (RLHF). We find that the RLHF models are increasingly difficult to red\nteam as they scale, and we find a flat trend with scale for the other model\ntypes. Second, we release our dataset of 38,961 red team attacks for others to\nanalyze and learn from. We provide our own analysis of the data and find a\nvariety of harmful outputs, which range from offensive language to more subtly\nharmful non-violent unethical outputs. Third, we exhaustively describe our\ninstructions, processes, statistical methodologies, and uncertainty about red\nteaming. We hope that this transparency accelerates our ability to work\ntogether as a community in order to develop shared norms, practices, and\ntechnical standards for how to red team language models.",

    "abstract": "Connectivity augmentation problems are among the most elementary questions in\nNetwork Design. Many of these problems admit natural $2$-approximation\nalgorithms, often through various classic techniques, whereas it remains open\nwhether approximation factors below $2$ can be achieved. One of the most basic\nexamples thereof is the Weighted Connectivity Augmentation Problem (WCAP). In\nWCAP, one is given an undirected graph together with a set of additional\nweighted candidate edges, and the task is to find a cheapest set of candidate\nedges whose addition to the graph increases its edge-connectivity. We present a\n$(1.5+\\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for WCAP, showing for the first\ntime that factors below $2$ are achievable.\nOn a high level, we design a well-chosen local search algorithm, inspired by\nrecent advances for Weighted Tree Augmentation. To measure progress, we\nconsider a directed weakening of WCAP and show that it has highly structured\nplanar solutions. Interpreting a solution of the original problem as one of\nthis directed weakening allows us to describe local exchange steps in a clean\nand algorithmically amenable way. Leveraging these insights, we show that we\ncan efficiently search for good exchange steps within a component class for\nlink sets that is closely related to bounded treewidth subgraphs of circle\ngraphs. Moreover, we prove that an optimum solution can be decomposed into\nsmaller components, at least one of which leads to a good local search step as\nlong as we did not yet achieve the claimed approximation guarantee.",

During the past decades, many log\nanalysis approaches have been proposed to detect system anomalies reflected by\nlogs.

These anomalies are often identified as violations of\nquantitative relational patterns or sequential patterns of log events in log\nsequences. However, existing methods fail to leverage the spatial structural\nrelationships among log events, resulting in potential false alarms and\nunstable performance. In this study, we propose a novel graph-based log anomaly\ndetection method, LogGD, to effectively address the issue by transforming log\nsequences into graphs. We exploit the powerful capability of Graph Transformer\nNeural Network, which combines graph structure and node semantics for log-based\nanomaly detection. We evaluate the proposed method on four widely-used public\nlog datasets. Experimental results show that LogGD can outperform\nstate-of-the-art quantitative-based and sequence-based methods and achieve\nstable performance under different window size settings.

It can be solved efficiently by the eigenvalue decomposition\nor singular value decomposition. If the optimal value of the first quaternion\noptimization subproblem is zero, then the system is rotationwise noiseless,\ni.e., there exists a ``perfect'' robot hand motion which meets all the testing\nposes rotationwise exactly. In this case, we apply the regularization technique\nfor solving the second subproblem to minimize the distance of the translation.\nOtherwise we apply the patching technique to solve the second quaternion\noptimization subproblem. Then solving the second quaternion optimization\nsubproblem turns out to be solving a quadratically constrained quadratic\nprogram.

    "title": "Less is Better: Recovering Intended-Feature Subspace to Robustify NLU  Models",
    "abstract": "Datasets with significant proportions of bias present threats for training a\ntrustworthy model on NLU tasks. Despite yielding great progress, current\ndebiasing methods impose excessive reliance on the knowledge of bias\nattributes. Definition of the attributes, however, is elusive and varies across\ndifferent datasets. Furthermore, leveraging these attributes at input level to\nbias mitigation may leave a gap between intrinsic properties and the underlying\ndecision rule. To narrow down this gap and liberate the supervision on bias, we\nsuggest extending bias mitigation into feature space. Therefore, a novel model,\nRecovering Intended-Feature Subspace with Knowledge-Free (RISK) is developed.\nAssuming that shortcut features caused by various biases are unintended for\nprediction, RISK views them as redundant features. When delving into a lower\nmanifold to remove redundancies, RISK reveals that an extremely low-dimensional\nsubspace with intended features can robustly represent the highly biased\ndataset. Empirical results demonstrate our model can consistently improve model\ngeneralization to out-of-distribution set, and achieves a new state-of-the-art\nperformance.",

    "abstract": "The robustness of signal temporal logic not only assesses whether a signal\nadheres to a specification but also provides a measure of how much a formula is\nfulfilled or violated. The calculation of robustness is based on evaluating the\nrobustness of underlying predicates. However, the robustness of predicates is\nusually defined in a model-free way, i.e., without including the system\ndynamics. Moreover, it is often nontrivial to define the robustness of\ncomplicated predicates precisely. To address these issues, we propose a notion\nof model predictive robustness, which provides a more systematic way of\nevaluating robustness compared to previous approaches by considering\nmodel-based predictions. In particular, we use Gaussian process regression to\nlearn the robustness based on precomputed predictions so that robustness values\ncan be efficiently computed online. We evaluate our approach for the use case\nof autonomous driving with predicates used in formalized traffic rules on a\nrecorded dataset, which highlights the advantage of our approach compared to\ntraditional approaches in terms of expressiveness. By incorporating our\nrobustness definitions into a trajectory planner, autonomous vehicles obey\ntraffic rules more robustly than human drivers in the dataset.",

    "abstract": "Data-driven predictive control (DPC) has been studied and used in various\nscenarios, since it could generate the predicted control sequence only relying\non the historical input and output data. Recently, based on cloud computing,\ndata-driven predictive cloud control system (DPCCS) has been proposed with the\nadvantage of sufficient computational resources. However, the existing\ncomputation mode of DPCCS is centralized. This computation mode could not\nutilize fully the computing power of cloud computing, of which the structure is\ndistributed. Thus, the computation delay could not been reduced and still\naffects the control quality. In this paper, a novel cloud-edge collaborative\ncontainerised workflow-based DPC system with disturbance observer (DOB) is\nproposed, to improve the computation efficiency and guarantee the control\naccuracy. First, a construction method for the DPC workflow is designed, to\nmatch the distributed processing environment of cloud computing. But the\nnon-computation overheads of the workflow tasks are relatively high. Therefore,\na cloud-edge collaborative control scheme with DOB is designed. The low-weight\ndata could be truncated to reduce the non-computation overheads. Meanwhile, we\ndesign an edge DOB to estimate and compensate the uncertainty in cloud workflow\nprocessing, and obtain the composite control variable. The UUB stability of the\nDOB is also proved. Third, to execute the workflow-based DPC controller and\nevaluate the proposed cloud-edge collaborative control scheme with DOB in the\nreal cloud environment, we design and implement a practical workflow-based\ncloud control experimental system based on container technology. Finally, a\nseries of evaluations show that, the computation times are decreased by 45.19%\nand 74.35% for two real-time control examples, respectively, and by at most\n85.10% for a high-dimension control example.",

    "abstract": "Numerous applications require robots to operate in environments shared with\nother agents such as humans or other robots. However, such shared scenes are\ntypically subject to different kinds of long-term semantic scene changes. The\nability to model and predict such changes is thus crucial for robot autonomy.\nIn this work, we formalize the task of semantic scene variability estimation\nand identify three main varieties of semantic scene change: changes in the\nposition of an object, its semantic state, or the composition of a scene as a\nwhole. To represent this variability, we propose the Variable Scene Graph\n(VSG), which augments existing 3D Scene Graph (SG) representations with the\nvariability attribute, representing the likelihood of discrete long-term change\nevents. We present a novel method, DeltaVSG, to estimate the variability of\nVSGs in a supervised fashion. We evaluate our method on the 3RScan long-term\ndataset, showing notable improvements in this novel task over existing\napproaches. Our method DeltaVSG achieves a precision of 72.2% and recall of\n66.8%, often mimicking human intuition about how indoor scenes change over\ntime. We further show the utility of VSG predictions in the task of active\nrobotic change detection, speeding up task completion by 62.4% compared to a\nscene-change-unaware planner.

While contrastive learning has yielded continuous advancements in\nsampling strategy and architecture design, it still remains two persistent\ndefects: the interference of task-irrelevant information and sample\ninefficiency, which are related to the recurring existence of trivial constant\nsolutions. From the perspective of dimensional analysis, we find out that the\ndimensional redundancy and dimensional confounder are the intrinsic issues\nbehind the phenomena, and provide experimental evidence to support our\nviewpoint. We further propose a simple yet effective approach MetaMask, short\nfor the dimensional Mask learned by Meta-learning, to learn representations\nagainst dimensional redundancy and confounder. MetaMask adopts the\nredundancy-reduction technique to tackle the dimensional redundancy issue and\ninnovatively introduces a dimensional mask to reduce the gradient effects of\nspecific dimensions containing the confounder, which is trained by employing a\nmeta-learning paradigm with the objective of improving the performance of\nmasked representations on a typical self-supervised task.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has been a vital protocol for migrating\ninformation learned from a labeled source domain to facilitate the\nimplementation in an unlabeled heterogeneous target domain. Although UDA is\ntypically jointly trained on data from both domains, accessing the labeled\nsource domain data is often restricted, due to concerns over patient data\nprivacy or intellectual property. To sidestep this, we propose \"off-the-shelf\n(OS)\" UDA (OSUDA), aimed at image segmentation, by adapting an OS segmentor\ntrained in a source domain to a target domain, in the absence of source domain\ndata in adaptation. Toward this goal, we aim to develop a novel batch-wise\nnormalization (BN) statistics adaptation framework. In particular, we gradually\nadapt the domain-specific low-order BN statistics, e.g., mean and variance,\nthrough an exponential momentum decay strategy, while explicitly enforcing the\nconsistency of the domain shareable high-order BN statistics, e.g., scaling and\nshifting factors, via our optimization objective. We also adaptively quantify\nthe channel-wise transferability to gauge the importance of each channel, via\nboth low-order statistics divergence and a scaling factor.~Furthermore, we\nincorporate unsupervised self-entropy minimization into our framework to boost\nperformance alongside a novel queued, memory-consistent self-training strategy\nto utilize the reliable pseudo label for stable and efficient unsupervised\nadaptation. We evaluated our OSUDA-based framework on both cross-modality and\ncross-subtype brain tumor segmentation and cardiac MR to CT segmentation tasks.\nOur experimental results showed that our memory consistent OSUDA performs\nbetter than existing source-relaxed UDA methods and yields similar performance\nto UDA methods with source data.",

    "abstract": "Detecting dangerous traffic agents in videos captured by vehicle-mounted\ndashboard cameras (dashcams) is essential to facilitate safe navigation in a\ncomplex environment. Accident-related videos are just a minor portion of the\ndriving video big data, and the transient pre-accident processes are highly\ndynamic and complex. Besides, risky and non-risky traffic agents can be similar\nin their appearance. These make risky object localization in the driving video\nparticularly challenging. To this end, this paper proposes an attention-guided\nmultistream feature fusion network (AM-Net) to localize dangerous traffic\nagents from dashcam videos. Two Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks use object\nbounding box and optical flow features extracted from consecutive video frames\nto capture spatio-temporal cues for distinguishing dangerous traffic agents. An\nattention module coupled with the GRUs learns to attend to the traffic agents\nrelevant to an accident. Fusing the two streams of features, AM-Net predicts\nthe riskiness scores of traffic agents in the video. In supporting this study,\nthe paper also introduces a benchmark dataset called Risky Object Localization\n(ROL).

    "title": "A Deep Moving-camera Background Model",
    "abstract": "In video analysis, background models have many applications such as\nbackground/foreground separation, change detection, anomaly detection,\ntracking, and more. However, while learning such a model in a video captured by\na static camera is a fairly-solved task, in the case of a Moving-camera\nBackground Model (MCBM), the success has been far more modest due to\nalgorithmic and scalability challenges that arise due to the camera motion.\nThus, existing MCBMs are limited in their scope and their supported\ncamera-motion types. These hurdles also impeded the employment, in this\nunsupervised task, of end-to-end solutions based on deep learning (DL).\nMoreover, existing MCBMs usually model the background either on the domain of a\ntypically-large panoramic image or in an online fashion. Unfortunately, the\nformer creates several problems, including poor scalability, while the latter\nprevents the recognition and leveraging of cases where the camera revisits\npreviously-seen parts of the scene. This paper proposes a new method, called\nDeepMCBM, that eliminates all the aforementioned issues and achieves\nstate-of-the-art results. Concretely, first we identify the difficulties\nassociated with joint alignment of video frames in general and in a DL setting\nin particular. Next, we propose a new strategy for joint alignment that lets us\nuse a spatial transformer net with neither a regularization nor any form of\nspecialized (and non-differentiable) initialization. Coupled with an\nautoencoder conditioned on unwarped robust central moments (obtained from the\njoint alignment), this yields an end-to-end regularization-free MCBM that\nsupports a broad range of camera motions and scales gracefully. We demonstrate\nDeepMCBM's utility on a variety of videos, including ones beyond the scope of\nother methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/BGU-CS-VIL/DeepMCBM .",

    "abstract": "Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly advanced the\nperformance of machine learning tasks on graphs. However, this technological\nbreakthrough makes people wonder: how does a GNN make such decisions, and can\nwe trust its prediction with high confidence? When it comes to some critical\nfields such as biomedicine, where making wrong decisions can have severe\nconsequences, interpreting the inner working mechanisms of GNNs before applying\nthem is crucial. In this paper, we propose a novel model-agnostic model-level\nexplanation method for different GNNs that follow the message passing scheme,\nGNNInterpreter, to explain the high-level decision-making process of the GNN\nmodel. More specifically, with continuous relaxation of graphs and the\nreparameterization trick, GNNInterpreter learns a probabilistic generative\ngraph distribution which produces the most representative graph for the target\nprediction in the eye of the GNN model. Compared with the only existing work,\nGNNInterpreter is more computationally efficient and more flexible in\ngenerating explanation graphs with different types of node features and edge\nfeatures, without introducing another blackbox to explain the GNN and without\nrequiring domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, the experimental studies\nconducted on four different datasets demonstrate that the explanation graph\ngenerated by GNNInterpreter can match the desired graph pattern when the model\nis ideal and reveal potential model pitfalls if there exist any.",

However, we observe that existing works endow\nconvolutional kernels with the dynamic property through one dimension\n(regarding the convolutional kernel number) of the kernel space, but the other\nthree dimensions (regarding the spatial size, the input channel number and the\noutput channel number for each convolutional kernel) are overlooked.

ODConv leverages a novel multi-dimensional attention mechanism with a\nparallel strategy to learn complementary attentions for convolutional kernels\nalong all four dimensions of the kernel space at any convolutional layer. As a\ndrop-in replacement of regular convolutions, ODConv can be plugged into many\nCNN architectures.

    "abstract": "Open source code is considered a common practice in modern software\ndevelopment. However, reusing other code allows bad actors to access a wide\ndevelopers' community, hence the products that rely on it. Those attacks are\ncategorized as supply chain attacks. Recent years saw a growing number of\nsupply chain attacks that leverage open source during software development,\nrelaying the download and installation procedures, whether automatic or manual.\nOver the years, many approaches have been invented for detecting vulnerable\npackages. However, it is uncommon to detect malicious code within packages.\nThose detection approaches can be broadly categorized as analyzes that use\n(dynamic) and do not use (static) code execution. Here, we introduce Malicious\nSource code Detection using Transformers (MSDT) algorithm. MSDT is a novel\nstatic analysis based on a deep learning method that detects real-world code\ninjection cases to source code packages. In this study, we used MSDT and a\ndataset with over 600,000 different functions to embed various functions and\napplied a clustering algorithm to the resulting vectors, detecting the\nmalicious functions by detecting the outliers. We evaluated MSDT's performance\nby conducting extensive experiments and demonstrated that our algorithm is\ncapable of detecting functions that were injected with malicious code with\nprecision@k values of up to 0.909.",

    "abstract": "Can we train a hybrid discriminative-generative model within a single\nnetwork? This question has recently been answered in the affirmative,\nintroducing the field of Joint Energy-based Model (JEM), which achieves high\nclassification accuracy and image generation quality simultaneously. Despite\nrecent advances, there remain two performance gaps: the accuracy gap to the\nstandard softmax classifier, and the generation quality gap to state-of-the-art\ngenerative models. In this paper, we introduce a variety of training techniques\nto bridge the accuracy gap and the generation quality gap of JEM. 1) We\nincorporate a recently proposed sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) framework to\ntrain JEM, which promotes the energy landscape smoothness and the\ngeneralizability of JEM. 2) We exclude data augmentation from the maximum\nlikelihood estimate pipeline of JEM, and mitigate the negative impact of data\naugmentation to image generation quality. Extensive experiments on multiple\ndatasets demonstrate that our SADA-JEM achieves state-of-the-art performances\nand outperforms JEM in image classification, image generation, calibration,\nout-of-distribution detection and adversarial robustness by a notable margin.",

    "abstract": "Phase field models are promising to tackle various fracture problems where a\ndiffusive crack is introduced and modelled using the phase variable. Owing to\nthe non-convexity of the energy functional, the derived partial differential\nequations are usually solved in a staggered manner. However, this method\nsuffers from a low convergence rate, and a large number of staggered iterations\nare needed, especially at the fracture nucleation and propagation. In this\nstudy, we propose novel staggered schemes, which are inspired by the\nfixed-stress split scheme in poromechanics. By fixing the stress when solving\nthe damage evolution, the displacement increment is expressed in terms of the\nincrement of the phase variable. The relation between these two increments\nenables a prediction of the displacement and the active energy based on the\nincrement of the phase variable. Thus, the maximum number of staggered\niterations is reduced, and the computational efficiency is improved. We present\nthree staggered schemes by fixing the first invariant, second invariant, or\nboth invariants of the stress, denoted by S1, S2, and S3 schemes. The\nperformance of the schemes is then verified by comparing with the standard\nstaggered scheme through three benchmark examples, i.e., tensile, shear, and\nL-shape panel tests. The results exhibit that the force-displacement relations\nand the crack patterns computed using the fast schemes are consistent with the\nones based on the standard staggered scheme. Moreover, the proposed S1 and S2\nschemes can largely reduce the maximum number of staggered iterations and total\nCPU time in all benchmark tests. The S2 scheme performs comparably except in\nthe shear test, where the underlying assumption is violated in the region close\nto the crack.",

The time-varying delay is a weird phenomenon that is appeared in\nalmost all systems. It can make many problems and instability while the system\nis working. In this paper, the time-varying delay is considered in both states\nand input vectors and is the sensible difference between the proposed method\nhere and previous algorithms, besides, it is unknown but bounded. To solve the\nproblem, the Razumikhin approach is applied to the proposed method since it\nincludes a Lyapunov function with the original nonaugmented state space of\nsystem models compared to Krasovskii formula. On the other hand, the Razumikhin\nmethod act better and avoids the inherent complexity of the Krasovskii\nspecifically when large delays and disturbances are appeared. To stabilize\noutput results, the model predictive control (MPC) is designed for the system\nand the considered system in this paper is interval type-2 (IT2) fuzzy T-S that\nhas better estimation of the dynamic model of the system.

We study the cost minimization counterpart of the\nclassical prophet inequality, where one is facing a sequence of costs $X_1,\nX_2, \\dots, X_n$ in an online manner and must ''stop'' at some point and take\nthe last cost seen. Given that the $X_i$'s are independent, drawn from known\ndistributions, the goal is to devise a stopping strategy $S$ (online algorithm)\nthat minimizes the expected cost.\nWe first observe that if the $X_i$'s are not identically distributed, then no\nstrategy can achieve a bounded approximation, no matter if the arrival order is\nadversarial or random. This leads us to consider the case where the $X_i$'s are\nI.I.D.. For the I.I.D. case, we give a complete characterization of the optimal\nstopping strategy. We show that it achieves a (distribution-dependent)\nconstant-factor approximation to the prophet's cost for almost all\ndistributions and that this constant is tight. In particular, for distributions\nfor which the integral of the hazard rate is a polynomial $H(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^k\na_i x^{d_i}$, where $d_1 < \\dots < d_k$, the approximation factor is\n$\\lambda(d_1)$, a decreasing function of $d_1$. Furthermore, for MHR\ndistributions, we show that this constant is at most $2$, and this is again\ntight.\nWe also analyze single-threshold strategies for the cost prophet inequality\nproblem. We design a threshold that achieves a\n$\\operatorname{O}(\\operatorname{polylog}n)$-factor approximation, where the\nexponent in the logarithmic factor is a distribution-dependent constant, and we\nshow a matching lower bound.\nWe believe that our results are of independent interest for analyzing\napproximately optimal (posted price-style) mechanisms for procuring items.",

Previous\nCNN and Transformer-based methods usually first generate a bird's-eye-view\n(BEV) feature map from the front view image, and then use a sub-network with\nBEV feature map as input to predict 3D lanes. Such approaches require an\nexplicit view transformation between BEV and front view, which itself is still\na challenging problem. In this paper, we propose CurveFormer, a single-stage\nTransformer-based method that directly calculates 3D lane parameters and can\ncircumvent the difficult view transformation step. Specifically, we formulate\n3D lane detection as a curve propagation problem by using curve queries. A 3D\nlane query is represented by a dynamic and ordered anchor point set. In this\nway, queries with curve representation in Transformer decoder iteratively\nrefine the 3D lane detection results. Moreover, a curve cross-attention module\nis introduced to compute the similarities between curve queries and image\nfeatures. Additionally, a context sampling module that can capture more\nrelative image features of a curve query is provided to further boost the 3D\nlane detection performance. We evaluate our method for 3D lane detection on\nboth synthetic and real-world datasets, and the experimental results show that\nour method achieves promising performance compared with the state-of-the-art\napproaches.

In this article, we argue that a straightforward\napplication of information maximization among alternative latent\nrepresentations of the same input naturally solves the collapse problem and\nachieves competitive empirical results. We propose a self-supervised learning\nmethod, CorInfoMax, that uses a second-order statistics-based mutual\ninformation measure that reflects the level of correlation among its arguments.\nMaximizing this correlative information measure between alternative\nrepresentations of the same input serves two purposes: (1) it avoids the\ncollapse problem by generating feature vectors with non-degenerate covariances;\n(2) it establishes relevance among alternative representations by increasing\nthe linear dependence among them. An approximation of the proposed information\nmaximization objective simplifies to a Euclidean distance-based objective\nfunction regularized by the log-determinant of the feature covariance matrix.\nThe regularization term acts as a natural barrier against feature space\ndegeneracy. Consequently, beyond avoiding complete output collapse to a single\npoint, the proposed approach also prevents dimensional collapse by encouraging\nthe spread of information across the whole feature space.

    "abstract": "Class-incremental learning for semantic segmentation (CiSS) is presently a\nhighly researched field which aims at updating a semantic segmentation model by\nsequentially learning new semantic classes. A major challenge in CiSS is\novercoming the effects of catastrophic forgetting, which describes the sudden\ndrop of accuracy on previously learned classes after the model is trained on a\nnew set of classes. Despite latest advances in mitigating catastrophic\nforgetting, the underlying causes of forgetting specifically in CiSS are not\nwell understood. Therefore, in a set of experiments and representational\nanalyses, we demonstrate that the semantic shift of the background class and a\nbias towards new classes are the major causes of forgetting in CiSS.\nFurthermore, we show that both causes mostly manifest themselves in deeper\nclassification layers of the network, while the early layers of the model are\nnot affected. Finally, we demonstrate how both causes are effectively mitigated\nutilizing the information contained in the background, with the help of\nknowledge distillation and an unbiased cross-entropy loss.",

To\nreduce human efforts, Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has become a popular\nfield that aims to automatically select, construct, tune, and update machine\nlearning models to achieve the best performance on specified tasks. In this\npaper, we conduct a review of existing methods in the model selection, tuning,\nand updating procedures in the area of AutoML in order to identify and\nsummarize the optimal solutions for every step of applying ML algorithms to IoT\ndata analytics. To justify our findings and help industrial users and\nresearchers better implement AutoML approaches, a case study of applying AutoML\nto IoT anomaly detection problems is conducted in this work.

    "abstract": "Search trees on trees (STTs) generalize the fundamental binary search tree\n(BST) data structure: in STTs the underlying search space is an arbitrary tree,\nwhereas in BSTs it is a path. An optimal BST of size $n$ can be computed for a\ngiven distribution of queries in $O(n^2)$ time [Knuth 1971] and centroid BSTs\nprovide a nearly-optimal alternative, computable in $O(n)$ time [Mehlhorn\n1977].\nBy contrast, optimal STTs are not known to be computable in polynomial time,\nand the fastest constant-approximation algorithm runs in $O(n^3)$ time\n[Berendsohn, Kozma 2022]. Centroid trees can be defined for STTs analogously to\nBSTs, and they have been used in a wide range of algorithmic applications. In\nthe unweighted case (i.e., for a uniform distribution of queries), a centroid\ntree can be computed in $O(n)$ time [Brodal et al. 2001; Della Giustina et al.\n2019]. These algorithms, however, do not readily extend to the weighted case.\nMoreover, no approximation guarantees were previously known for centroid trees\nin either the unweighted or weighted cases.\nIn this paper we revisit centroid trees in a general, weighted setting, and\nwe settle both the algorithmic complexity of constructing them, and the quality\nof their approximation. For constructing a weighted centroid tree, we give an\noutput-sensitive $O(n\\log h)\\subseteq O(n\\log n)$ time algorithm, where $h$ is\nthe height of the resulting centroid tree. If the weights are of polynomial\ncomplexity, the running time is $O(n\\log\\log n)$. We show these bounds to be\noptimal, in a general decision tree model of computation. For approximation, we\nprove that the cost of a centroid tree is at most twice the optimum, and this\nguarantee is best possible, both in the weighted and unweighted cases. We also\ngive tight, fine-grained bounds on the approximation-ratio for bounded-degree\ntrees and on the approximation-ratio of more general $\\alpha$-centroid trees.",

Nowadays, archiving is not enough anymore. The amount of\ndata that gets generated daily is beyond human comprehension, and appeals for\nnew information retrieval strategies. Instead of referencing every single data\npiece as in traditional archival techniques, a more relevant approach consists\nin understanding the overall ideas conveyed in data flows. To spot such general\ntendencies, a precise comprehension of the underlying data generation\nmechanisms is required. In the rich literature tackling this problem, the\nquestion of information interaction remains nearly unexplored. First, we\ninvestigate the frequency of such interactions. Building on recent advances\nmade in Stochastic Block Modelling, we explore the role of interactions in\nseveral social networks. We find that interactions are rare in these datasets.\nThen, we wonder how interactions evolve over time. Earlier data pieces should\nnot have an everlasting influence on ulterior data generation mechanisms. We\nmodel this using dynamic network inference advances. We conclude that\ninteractions are brief. Finally, we design a framework that jointly models rare\nand brief interactions based on Dirichlet-Hawkes Processes. We argue that this\nnew class of models fits brief and sparse interaction modelling. We conduct a\nlarge-scale application on Reddit and find that interactions play a minor role\nin this dataset. From a broader perspective, our work results in a collection\nof highly flexible models and in a rethinking of core concepts of machine\nlearning.

Existing acyclicity characterizations\nare based on the idea that powers of an adjacency matrix contain information\nabout walks and cycles. In this work, we propose a $\\textit{fundamentally\ndifferent}$ acyclicity characterization based on the log-determinant (log-det)\nfunction, which leverages the nilpotency property of DAGs. To deal with the\ninherent asymmetries of a DAG, we relate the domain of our log-det\ncharacterization to the set of $\\textit{M-matrices}$, which is a key difference\nto the classical log-det function defined over the cone of positive definite\nmatrices. Similar to acyclicity functions previously proposed, our\ncharacterization is also exact and differentiable. However, when compared to\nexisting characterizations, our log-det function: (1) Is better at detecting\nlarge cycles; (2) Has better-behaved gradients; and (3) Its runtime is in\npractice about an order of magnitude faster. From the optimization side, we\ndrop the typically used augmented Lagrangian scheme, and propose DAGMA\n($\\textit{Directed Acyclic Graphs via M-matrices for Acyclicity}$), a method\nthat resembles the central path for barrier methods. Each point in the central\npath of DAGMA is a solution to an unconstrained problem regularized by our\nlog-det function, then we show that at the limit of the central path the\nsolution is guaranteed to be a DAG.

However, most learning algorithms return\nonly one of these models, leaving practitioners with no practical way to\nexplore alternative models that might have desirable properties beyond what\ncould be expressed within a loss function. The Rashomon set is the set of these\nall almost-optimal models. Rashomon sets can be extremely complicated,\nparticularly for highly nonlinear function classes that allow complex\ninteraction terms, such as decision trees. We provide the first technique for\ncompletely enumerating the Rashomon set for sparse decision trees; in fact, our\nwork provides the first complete enumeration of any Rashomon set for a\nnon-trivial problem with a highly nonlinear discrete function class. This\nallows the user an unprecedented level of control over model choice among all\nmodels that are approximately equally good. We represent the Rashomon set in a\nspecialized data structure that supports efficient querying and sampling. We\nshow three applications of the Rashomon set: 1) it can be used to study\nvariable importance for the set of almost-optimal trees (as opposed to a single\ntree), 2) the Rashomon set for accuracy enables enumeration of the Rashomon\nsets for balanced accuracy and F1-score, and 3) the Rashomon set for a full\ndataset can be used to produce Rashomon sets constructed with only subsets of\nthe data set. Thus, we are able to examine Rashomon sets across problems with a\nnew lens, enabling users to choose models rather than be at the mercy of an\nalgorithm that produces only a single model.",

It is known that decision tree complexity is bounded above by the\ncube of block sensitivity, and the cube of polynomial degree. However, the\nwidest separation between decision tree complexity and each of block\nsensitivity and degree that is witnessed by known Boolean functions is\nquadratic. In this work, we investigate the tightness of the existing cubic\nupper bounds.\nWe improve the cubic upper bounds for many interesting classes of Boolean\nfunctions. We show that for graph properties and for functions with a constant\nnumber of alternations, both of the cubic upper bounds can be improved to\nquadratic. We define a class of Boolean functions, which we call the zebra\nfunctions, that comprises Boolean functions where each monotone path from 0^n\nto 1^n has an equal number of alternations. This class contains the symmetric\nand monotone functions as its subclasses. We show that for any zebra function,\ndecision tree complexity is at most the square of block sensitivity, and\ncertificate complexity is at most the square of degree.\nFinally, we show using a lifting theorem of communication complexity by\nG{\\\"{o}}{\\\"{o}}s, Pitassi and Watson that the task of proving an improved upper\nbound on the decision tree complexity for all functions is in a sense\nequivalent to the potentially easier task of proving a similar upper bound on\ncommunication complexity for each bi-partition of the input variables, for all\nfunctions. In particular, this implies that to bound the decision tree\ncomplexity it suffices to bound smaller measures like parity decision tree\ncomplexity, subcube decision tree complexity and decision tree rank, that are\ndefined in terms of models that can be efficiently simulated by communication\nprotocols.",

Extensive experiments and case studies show that our work\nis more effective and superior.",

    "abstract": "Mobile apps are becoming an integral part of people's daily life by providing\nvarious functionalities, such as messaging and gaming. App developers try their\nbest to ensure user experience during app development and maintenance to\nimprove the rating of their apps on app platforms and attract more user\ndownloads. Previous studies indicated that responding to users' reviews tends\nto change their attitude towards the apps positively. Users who have been\nreplied are more likely to update the given ratings. However, reading and\nresponding to every user review is not an easy task for developers since it is\ncommon for popular apps to receive tons of reviews every day. Thus, automation\ntools for review replying are needed.\nTo address the need above, the paper introduces a Transformer-based approach,\nnamed TRRGen, to automatically generate responses to given user reviews. TRRGen\nextracts apps' categories, rating, and review text as the input features. By\nadapting a Transformer-based model, TRRGen can generate appropriate replies for\nnew reviews. Comprehensive experiments and analysis on the real-world datasets\nindicate that the proposed approach can generate high-quality replies for\nusers' reviews and significantly outperform current state-of-art approaches on\nthe task. The manual validation results on the generated replies further\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

    "abstract": "Tabular data is the foundation of the information age and has been\nextensively studied. Recent studies show that neural-based models are effective\nin learning contextual representation for tabular data. The learning of an\neffective contextual representation requires meaningful features and a large\namount of data. However, current methods often fail to properly learn a\ncontextual representation from the features without semantic information. In\naddition, it's intractable to enlarge the training set through mixed tabular\ndatasets due to the difference between datasets. To address these problems, we\npropose a novel framework PTab, using the Pre-trained language model to model\nTabular data. PTab learns a contextual representation of tabular data through a\nthree-stage processing: Modality Transformation(MT), Masked-Language\nFine-tuning(MF), and Classification Fine-tuning(CF). We initialize our model\nwith a pre-trained Model (PTM) which contains semantic information learned from\nthe large-scale language data. Consequently, contextual representation can be\nlearned effectively during the fine-tuning stages. In addition, we can\nnaturally mix the textualized tabular data to enlarge the training set to\nfurther improve representation learning. We evaluate PTab on eight popular\ntabular classification datasets. Experimental results show that our method has\nachieved a better average AUC score in supervised settings compared to the\nstate-of-the-art baselines(e.g. XGBoost), and outperforms counterpart methods\nunder semi-supervised settings.

Recent work provides a data-driven approach to compute the\ndensity distribution of autonomous systems' forward reachable states online. In\nthis paper, we study the use of such approach in combination with model\npredictive control for verifiable safe path planning under uncertainties. We\nfirst use the learned density distribution to compute the risk of collision\nonline. If such risk exceeds the acceptable threshold, our method will plan for\na new path around the previous trajectory, with the risk of collision below the\nthreshold. Our method is well-suited to handle systems with uncertainties and\ncomplicated dynamics as our data-driven approach does not need an analytical\nform of the systems' dynamics and can estimate forward state density with an\narbitrary initial distribution of uncertainties. We design two challenging\nscenarios (autonomous driving and hovercraft control) for safe motion planning\nin environments with obstacles under system uncertainties. We first show that\nour density estimation approach can reach a similar accuracy as the\nMonte-Carlo-based method while using only 0.01X training samples.

Scalability is\na major issue for vehicular communication, specially, when the number of\nvehicles increases at any given point. Vehicles also suffer some other problems\nsuch as broadcast problem. Clustering can solve the issues of vehicular ad hoc\nnetwork (VANET); however, due to the high mobility of the vehicles, clustering\nin VANET suffers stability issue. Previously proposed clustering algorithms for\nVANET are optimized for either straight road or for intersection. Moreover, the\nabsence of the intelligent use of a combination of the mobility parameters,\nsuch as direction, movement, position, velocity, degree of vehicle, movement at\nthe intersection etc., results in cluster stability issues. A dynamic\nclustering algorithm considering the efficient use of all the mobility\nparameters can solve the stability problem in VANET. To achieve higher\nstability for VANET, a novel robust and dynamic clustering algorithm stable\ndynamic predictive clustering (SDPC) for VANET is proposed in this paper. In\ncontrast to previous studies, vehicle relative velocity, vehicle position,\nvehicle distance, transmission range, and vehicle density are considered in the\ncreation of a cluster, whereas relative distance, movement at the intersection,\ndegree of vehicles are considered to select the cluster head. From the mobility\nparameters the future road scenario is constructed. The cluster is created, and\nthe cluster head is selected based on the future construction of the road. The\nperformance of SDPC is compared in terms of the average cluster head change\nrate, the average cluster head duration, the average cluster member duration,\nand the ratio of clustering overhead in terms of total packet transmission.

Most of the objects have never received a\nspectroscopic follow-up, which is especially crucial for transients e.g.\nsupernovae. In such cases, observed light curves could present an affordable\nalternative. Time series are actively used for photometric classification and\ncharacterization, such as peak and luminosity decline estimation. However, the\ncollected time series are multidimensional, irregularly sampled, contain\noutliers, and do not have well-defined systematic uncertainties. Machine\nlearning methods help extract useful information from available data in the\nmost efficient way.

We\nshow that the methods described in this work have better computational\ncomplexity and work faster than Gaussian Processes. We analyze the performance\nof the approximation techniques aiming to fill the gaps in the observations of\nthe light curves, and show that the use of appropriate technique increases the\naccuracy of peak finding and supernova classification.

    "abstract": "Precipitation results from complex processes across many scales, making its\naccurate simulation in Earth system models (ESMs) challenging. Existing\npost-processing methods can improve ESM simulations locally, but cannot correct\nerrors in modelled spatial patterns. Here we propose a framework based on\nphysically constrained generative adversarial networks (GANs) to improve local\ndistributions and spatial structure simultaneously. We apply our approach to\nthe computationally efficient ESM CM2Mc-LPJmL. Our method outperforms existing\nones in correcting local distributions, and leads to strongly improved spatial\npatterns especially regarding the intermittency of daily precipitation.\nNotably, a double-peaked Intertropical Convergence Zone, a common problem in\nESMs, is removed. Enforcing a physical constraint to preserve global\nprecipitation sums, the GAN can generalize to future climate scenarios unseen\nduring training. Feature attribution shows that the GAN identifies regions\nwhere the ESM exhibits strong biases. Our method constitutes a general\nframework for correcting ESM variables and enables realistic simulations at a\nfraction of the computational costs.",

    "abstract": "Batch normalization is widely used in deep learning to normalize intermediate\nactivations. Deep networks suffer from notoriously increased training\ncomplexity, mandating careful initialization of weights, requiring lower\nlearning rates, etc. These issues have been addressed by Batch Normalization\n(\\textbf{BN}), by normalizing the inputs of activations to zero mean and unit\nstandard deviation. Making this batch normalization part of the training\nprocess dramatically accelerates the training process of very deep networks. A\nnew field of research has been going on to examine the exact theoretical\nexplanation behind the success of \\textbf{BN}. Most of these theoretical\ninsights attempt to explain the benefits of \\textbf{BN} by placing them on its\ninfluence on optimization, weight scale invariance, and regularization. Despite\n\\textbf{BN} undeniable success in accelerating generalization, the gap of\nanalytically relating the effect of \\textbf{BN} to the regularization parameter\nis still missing. This paper aims to bring out the data-dependent auto-tuning\nof the regularization parameter by \\textbf{BN} with analytical proofs. We have\nposed \\textbf{BN} as a constrained optimization imposed on non-\\textbf{BN}\nweights through which we demonstrate its data statistics dependant auto-tuning\nof regularization parameter.

Prior work has demonstrated that\ndeep learning models that take advantage of the data's 3D structure can\noutperform standard machine learning on several learning tasks. However, most\nprior research in this area has focused on neuroimaging data from adults.\nWithin the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset, a large\nlongitudinal development study, we examine structural MRI data to predict\ngender and identify gender-related changes in brain structure. Results\ndemonstrate that gender prediction accuracy is exceptionally high (>97%) with\ntraining epochs >200 and that this accuracy increases with age. Brain regions\nidentified as the most discriminative in the task under study include\npredominantly frontal areas and the temporal lobe. When evaluating gender\npredictive changes specific to a two-year increase in age, a broader set of\nvisual, cingulate, and insular regions are revealed. Our findings show a robust\ngender-related structural brain change pattern, even over a small age range.\nThis suggests that it might be possible to study how the brain changes during\nadolescence by looking at how these changes are related to different behavioral\nand environmental factors.",

The interaction potentials are then learned directly by stochastic\ngradient descent, using backpropagation to calculate the gradient of the\nstructural loss metric with respect to the interaction potential through the MD\nsimulation. This gradient-based method is flexible and can be configured to\nsimulate and optimize multiple systems simultaneously.

Additionally, there is not a single unified approach for\nembedding real-world large-scale datasets in limited qubits. 2) Some real-world\ndatasets are very small for training QML networks. Hence, to tackle these two\nchallenges for benchmarking and validating QML networks on real-world, small,\nand large-scale datasets in one-go, we employ quantum transfer learning\ncomposed a multi-qubit QML network and very deep convolutional network (VGG16)\nextracting informative features from any small, large-scale dataset. We use\nreal amplitudes and strong entangling N-layer QML networks with and without\ndata re-uploading layers as a multi-qubit QML network and evaluate their\nexpressive power quantified by using local effective dimension; the lower local\neffective dimension of a QML network is, the better its performance on unseen\ndata is. Our numerical result shows that the strong entangling N-layer QML\nnetwork has lower local effective dimension than the real amplitudes QML\nnetwork and outperforms it and classical transfer learning on the\nhard-to-classify three-class labelling problem. In addition, quantum transfer\nlearning helps us to tackle the two challenges mentioned for benchmarking and\nvalidating QML networks on real-world, small, and large-scale datasets.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider decentralized optimization problems where agents\nhave individual cost functions to minimize subject to subspace constraints that\nrequire the minimizers across the network to lie in low-dimensional subspaces.\nThis constrained formulation includes consensus or single-task optimization as\nspecial cases, and allows for more general task relatedness models such as\nmultitask smoothness and coupled optimization. In order to cope with\ncommunication constraints, we propose and study an adaptive decentralized\nstrategy where the agents employ differential randomized quantizers to compress\ntheir estimates before communicating with their neighbors. The analysis shows\nthat, under some general conditions on the quantization noise, and for\nsufficiently small step-sizes $\\mu$, the strategy is stable both in terms of\nmean-square error and average bit rate: by reducing $\\mu$, it is possible to\nkeep the estimation errors small (on the order of $\\mu$) without increasing\nindefinitely the bit rate as $\\mu\\rightarrow 0$. Simulations illustrate the\ntheoretical findings and the effectiveness of the proposed approach, revealing\nthat decentralized learning is achievable at the expense of only a few bits.",

    "abstract": "Ti-6Al-4V is a titanium alloy with excellent properties for lightweight\napplications and its production through Additive Manufacturing processes is\nattractive for different industrial sectors. In this work, the influence of\nmechanical properties on the notch fracture resistance of Ti-6Al-4V produced by\nSelective Laser Melting is numerically investigated. Literature data is used to\ninform material behaviour. The as-built brittle behaviour is compared to the\nenhanced ductile response after heat treatment (HT) and hot isostatic pressing\n(HIP) post-processes. A Phase Field framework is adopted to capture damage\nnucleation and propagation from two different notch geometries and a discussion\non the influence of fracture energy and the characteristic length is carried\nout. In addition, the influence of oxygen uptake is analysed by reproducing\nnon-inert atmospheres during HT and HIP, showing that oxygen shifts fracture to\nbrittle failures due to the formation of an alpha case layer, especially for\nthe V-notch geometry. Results show that a pure elastic behaviour can be assumed\nfor the as-built SLM condition, whereas elastic-plastic phenomena must be\nmodelled for specimens subjected to heat treatment or hot isostatic pressing.\nThe present brittle Phase Field framework coupled with an elastic-plastic\nconstitutive analysis is demonstrated to be a robust prediction tool for notch\nfracture after different post-processing routes.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) images, such as CT, MRI, and PET, are common in\nmedical imaging applications and important in clinical diagnosis. Semantic\nambiguity is a typical feature of many medical image labels. It can be caused\nby many factors, such as the imaging properties, pathological anatomy, and the\nweak representation of the binary masks, which brings challenges to accurate 3D\nsegmentation. In 2D medical images, using soft masks instead of binary masks\ngenerated by image matting to characterize lesions can provide rich semantic\ninformation, describe the structural characteristics of lesions more\ncomprehensively, and thus benefit the subsequent diagnoses and analyses. In\nthis work, we introduce image matting into the 3D scenes to describe the\nlesions in 3D medical images. The study of image matting in 3D modality is\nlimited, and there is no high-quality annotated dataset related to 3D matting,\ntherefore slowing down the development of data-driven deep-learning-based\nmethods. To address this issue, we constructed the first 3D medical matting\ndataset and convincingly verified the validity of the dataset through quality\ncontrol and downstream experiments in lung nodules classification. We then\nadapt the four selected state-of-the-art 2D image matting algorithms to 3D\nscenes and further customize the methods for CT images. Also, we propose the\nfirst end-to-end deep 3D matting network and implement a solid 3D medical image\nmatting benchmark, which will be released to encourage further research.",

    "abstract": "There has been growing research interest in using deep learning based method\nto achieve fully automated segmentation of lesion in Positron emission\ntomography computed tomography(PET CT) scans for the prognosis of various\ncancers. Recent advances in the medical image segmentation shows the nnUNET is\nfeasible for diverse tasks. However, lesion segmentation in the PET images is\nnot straightforward, because lesion and physiological uptake has similar\ndistribution patterns. The Distinction of them requires extra structural\ninformation in the CT images. The present paper introduces a nnUNet based\nmethod for the lesion segmentation task. The proposed model is designed on the\nbasis of the joint 2D and 3D nnUNET architecture to predict lesions across the\nwhole body. It allows for automated segmentation of potential lesions.

Recently\nO'Sullivan studied the asymptotic expansion of $p^{k}(n)$-partitions into $k$th\npowers, initiated by Wright, and consequently obtained an asymptotic expansion\nfor $p(n)$ along with a concise description of the coefficients involved in the\nexpansion but without any estimation of the error term.

The Fourier transform requires the\ntransitive closure of the DAG for which several forms are possible depending on\nthe interpretation of the edge weights. Examples include level of influence,\ndistance, or pollution distribution. Our framework is different from prior GSP:\nit is specific to DAGs and leverages, and extends, the classical theory of\nMoebius inversion from combinatorics. For a prototypical application we\nconsider DAGs modeling dynamic networks in which edges change over time.\nSpecifically, we model the spread of an infection on such a DAG obtained from\nreal-world contact tracing data and learn the infection signal from samples\nassuming sparsity in the Fourier domain.",

    "abstract": "The Gaussian kernel and its traditional normalizations (e.g., row-stochastic)\nare popular approaches for assessing similarities between data points, commonly\nused for manifold learning and clustering, as well as supervised and\nsemi-supervised learning on graphs. In many practical situations, the data can\nbe corrupted by noise that prohibits traditional affinity matrices from\ncorrectly assessing similarities, especially if the noise magnitudes vary\nconsiderably across the data, e.g., under heteroskedasticity or outliers. An\nalternative approach that provides a more stable behavior under noise is the\ndoubly stochastic normalization of the Gaussian kernel. In this work, we\ninvestigate this normalization in a setting where points are sampled from an\nunknown density on a low-dimensional manifold embedded in high-dimensional\nspace and corrupted by possibly strong, non-identically distributed,\nsub-Gaussian noise. We establish the pointwise concentration of the doubly\nstochastic affinity matrix and its scaling factors around certain population\nforms. We then utilize these results to develop several tools for robust\ninference. First, we derive a robust density estimator that can substantially\noutperform the standard kernel density estimator under high-dimensional noise.\nSecond, we provide estimators for the pointwise noise magnitudes, the pointwise\nsignal magnitudes, and the pairwise Euclidean distances between clean data\npoints. Lastly, we derive robust graph Laplacian normalizations that\napproximate popular manifold Laplacians, including the Laplace Beltrami\noperator, showing that the local geometry of the manifold can be recovered\nunder high-dimensional noise. We exemplify our results in simulations and on\nreal single-cell RNA-sequencing data. In the latter, we show that our proposed\nnormalizations are robust to technical variability associated with different\ncell types.",
