    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved excellent performance in various\nfields. However, DNNs' vulnerability to Adversarial Examples (AE) hinders their\ndeployments to safety-critical applications. This paper presents a novel AE\ndetection framework, named BEYOND, for trustworthy predictions. BEYOND performs\nthe detection by distinguishing the AE's abnormal relation with its augmented\nversions, i.e. neighbors, from two prospects: representation similarity and\nlabel consistency. An off-the-shelf Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) model is\nused to extract the representation and predict the label for its highly\ninformative representation capacity compared to supervised learning models. For\nclean samples, their representations and predictions are closely consistent\nwith their neighbors, whereas those of AEs differ greatly. Furthermore, we\nexplain this observation and show that by leveraging this discrepancy BEYOND\ncan effectively detect AEs. We develop a rigorous justification for the\neffectiveness of BEYOND. Furthermore, as a plug-and-play model, BEYOND can\neasily cooperate with the Adversarial Trained Classifier (ATC), achieving the\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) robustness accuracy. Experimental results show that\nBEYOND outperforms baselines by a large margin, especially under adaptive\nattacks. Empowered by the robust relation net built on SSL, we found that\nBEYOND outperforms baselines in terms of both detection ability and speed. Our\ncode will be publicly available.",

    "abstract": "Minimum flow decomposition (MFD) -- the problem of finding a minimum set of\nweighted source-to-sink paths that perfectly decomposes a flow -- is a\nclassical problem in Computer Science, and variants of it are powerful models\nin different fields such as Bioinformatics and Transportation. Even on acyclic\ngraphs, the problem is NP-hard, and most practical solutions have been via\nheuristics or approximations. While there is an extensive body of research on\nacyclic graphs, currently, there is no \\emph{exact} solution on graphs with\ncycles. In this paper, we present the first ILP formulation for three natural\nvariants of the MFD problem in graphs with cycles, asking for a decomposition\nconsisting only of weighted source-to-sink paths or cycles, trails, and walks,\nrespectively. On three datasets of increasing levels of complexity from both\nBioinformatics and Transportation, our approaches solve any instance in under\n10 minutes.

    "abstract": "Current self-supervised approaches for skeleton action representation\nlearning often focus on constrained scenarios, where videos and skeleton data\nare recorded in laboratory settings. When dealing with estimated skeleton data\nin real-world videos, such methods perform poorly due to the large variations\nacross subjects and camera viewpoints. To address this issue, we introduce ViA,\na novel View-Invariant Autoencoder for self-supervised skeleton action\nrepresentation learning. ViA leverages motion retargeting between different\nhuman performers as a pretext task, in order to disentangle the latent\naction-specific `Motion' features on top of the visual representation of a 2D\nor 3D skeleton sequence. Such `Motion' features are invariant to skeleton\ngeometry and camera view and allow ViA to facilitate both, cross-subject and\ncross-view action classification tasks. We conduct a study focusing on\ntransfer-learning for skeleton-based action recognition with self-supervised\npre-training on real-world data (e.g., Posetics). Our results showcase that\nskeleton representations learned from ViA are generic enough to improve upon\nstate-of-the-art action classification accuracy, not only on 3D laboratory\ndatasets such as NTU-RGB+D 60 and NTU-RGB+D 120, but also on real-world\ndatasets where only 2D data are accurately estimated, e.g., Toyota Smarthome,\nUAV-Human and Penn Action.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised contrastive learning (UCL) is a self-supervised learning\ntechnique that aims to learn a useful representation function by pulling\npositive samples close to each other while pushing negative samples far apart\nin the embedding space. To improve the performance of UCL, several works\nintroduced hard-negative unsupervised contrastive learning (H-UCL) that aims to\nselect the \"hard\" negative samples in contrast to a random sampling strategy\nused in UCL. In another approach, under the assumption that the label\ninformation is available, supervised contrastive learning (SCL) has developed\nrecently by extending the UCL to a fully-supervised setting. In this paper,\nmotivated by the effectiveness of hard-negative sampling strategies in H-UCL\nand the usefulness of label information in SCL, we propose a contrastive\nlearning framework called hard-negative supervised contrastive learning\n(H-SCL). Our numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of H-SCL over both\nSCL and H-UCL on several image datasets. In addition, we theoretically prove\nthat, under certain conditions, the objective function of H-SCL can be bounded\nby the objective function of H-UCL but not by the objective function of UCL.\nThus, minimizing the H-UCL loss can act as a proxy to minimize the H-SCL loss\nwhile minimizing UCL loss cannot. As we numerically showed that H-SCL\noutperforms other contrastive learning methods, our theoretical result\n(bounding H-SCL loss by H-UCL loss) helps to explain why H-UCL outperforms UCL\nin practice.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicle platooning promises many benefits such as fuel efficiency,\nroad safety, reduced traffic congestion, and passenger comfort. Platooning\nvehicles travel in a single file, in close distance, and at the same velocity.\nThe platoon formation is autonomously maintained by a Cooperative Adaptive\nCruise Control (CACC) system which relies on sensory data and\nvehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. In fact, V2V messages play a critical\nrole in shortening the platooning distance while maintaining safety. Whereas\nV2V message integrity and source authentication can be verified via\ncryptographic methods, establishing the truthfulness of the message contents is\na much harder task.\nThis work establishes a physical access control mechanism to restrict V2V\nmessages to platooning members. Specifically, we aim at tying the digital\nidentity of a candidate requesting to join a platoon to its physical trajectory\nrelative to the platoon. We propose the {\\em Wiggle} protocol that employs a\nphysical challenge-response exchange to prove that a candidate requesting to be\nadmitted into a platoon actually follows it. The protocol name is inspired by\nthe random longitudinal movements that the candidate is challenged to execute.\n{\\em Wiggle} prevents any remote adversary from joining the platoon and\ninjecting fake CACC messages.

    "abstract": "Safety is a critical property for control systems in medicine,\ntransportation, manufacturing, and other applications, and can be defined as\nensuring positive invariance of a predefined safe set. One approach to ensuring\nsafety is to construct a Control Barrier Function (CBF) such that the system is\nsafe when the CBF is nonnegative, and then choose a control input to ensure\nnonnegativity of the CBF at each time step, provided that such an input exists.\nThis paper investigates the problems of verification and synthesis of control\nbarrier functions. In the area of verification, we use the algebraic-geometric\nPositivstellensatz to construct convex equivalent conditions for a CBF to\nensure safety. We extend these conditions to control policies based on unions\nand intersections of CBFs, high-order CBFs, and systems with trigonometric\ndynamics, actuation constraints, and Euler-Lagrange dynamics. In the area of\nsynthesis, we propose algorithms for constructing CBFs, namely, an\nalternating-descent approach, a local CBF approach, and a Newton's method\napproach.

To\novercome these limitations we investigate a new computational approach that\nbuilds on a novel shape representation that is volumetric, as in recent\ndifferentiable rendering approaches, but parameterized with depth maps to\nbetter materialize the shape surface. The shape energy associated to this\nrepresentation evaluates 3D geometry given color images and does not need\nappearance prediction but still benefits from volumetric integration when\noptimized.

Various photo-consistency priors can be accounted\nfor such as a median based baseline, or a more elaborated criterion as with a\nlearned function.

Given the results, the GGArray is\na potentially useful structure for applications with high uncertainty on the\nmemory usage as well as applications that have phases, such as an insertion\nphase followed by a regular GPU phase. In such cases, the GGArray can be used\nfor the first phase and then data can be flattened for the second phase in\norder to allow the classical GPU memory accesses which are faster. These\nresults constitute a step towards achieving a parallel efficient C++ like\nvector for modern GPU architectures.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the equivalence of two kinds of Model Predictive Control\n(MPC) based on the state-space (SS) model and the autoregressive model with\nexogenous (ARX) terms model. Firstly, based on the Cayley-Hamilton (CH)\ntheorem, a SS model can be transformed into a unique equivalent ARX model, but\nthis CH-based SS-to-ARX transformation is sensitive to process and measurement\nnoises. We then present two more generalized SS-to-ARX transformations based on\nthe Observer-Theory (OT) and Kalman Filter (KF). The same structure of their\nfinal transformed ARX models explains that the OT-based SS-to-ARX\ntransformation is robust to noises. Thus, an observable linear SS model can be\nequivalently transformed into an ARX model by designing an observer via pole\nplacement method. This paper suggests for the first time how to play the role\nof SS-to-ARX transformation, which can be used in an interpretive and adaptive\nMPC framework. That is, an interpretative SS model is transformed into its\nequivalent adaptive ARX model in offline design, and then the adaptive ARX\nmodel updates online. An AFTI-16 MPC numerical example is used to illustrate\nthe equivalence of SS-based MPC and ARX-based MPC problem and investigate the\nrobustness of different SS-to-ARX transformations to noises",

Our findings show that contextualized methods can often\npredict high change scores for words which are not undergoing any real\ndiachronic semantic shift in the lexicographic sense of the term (or at least\nthe status of these shifts is questionable). Such challenging cases are\ndiscussed in detail with examples, and their linguistic categorization is\nproposed. Our conclusion is that pre-trained contextualized language models are\nprone to confound changes in lexicographic senses and changes in contextual\nvariance, which naturally stem from their distributional nature, but is\ndifferent from the types of issues observed in methods based on static\nembeddings.

    "abstract": "An oracle is a mechanism to decide whether the outputs of the program for the\nexecuted test cases are correct. For machine learning programs, such oracle is\nnot available or too difficult to apply. Metamorphic testing is a testing\napproach that uses metamorphic relations, which are necessary properties of the\nsoftware under test to help verify the correctness of a program. Prioritization\nof metamorphic relations helps to reduce the cost of metamorphic testing [1].\nHowever, prioritizing metamorphic relations based on code coverage is often not\neffective for prioritizing MRs for machine learning programs, since the\ndecision logic of a machine learning model is learned from training data, and\n100% code coverage can be easily achieved with a single test input. To this\nend, in this work, we propose a cost-effective approach based on diversity in\nthe source and follow-up data set to prioritize metamorphic relations for\nmachine learning programs. We show that the proposed data diversity-based\nprioritization approach increase the fault detection effectiveness by up to 40%\nwhen compared to the code coverage-based approach and reduce the time taken to\ndetect a fault by 29% when compared to random execution of MRs. Overall, our\napproach leads to saving time and cost during testing.",

    "title": "Stability of the Gaussian Stationary Point in the Han-Kobayashi Region  for Z-Interference Channels",
    "abstract": "The Gaussian stationary point in an inequality motivated by the\nZ-interference channel was recently conjectured by Costa, Nair, Ng, and Wang to\nbe the global optimizer, which, if true, would imply the optimality of the\nHan-Kobayashi region for the Gaussian Z-interference channel. This conjecture\nwas known to be true for some parameter regimes, but the validity for all\nparameters, although suggested by Gaussian tensorization, was previously open.\nIn this paper we construct several counterexamples showing that this conjecture\nmay fail in certain regimes: A simple construction without Hermite polynomial\nperturbation is proposed, where distributions far from Gaussian are\nanalytically shown to be better than the Gaussian stationary point. As\nalternatives, we consider perturbation along geodesics under either the $L^2$\nor Wasserstein-2 metric, showing that the Gaussian stationary point is unstable\nin a certain regime. Similarity to stability of the Levy-Cramer theorem is\ndiscussed. The stability phase transition point admits a simple\ncharacterization in terms of the maximum eigenvalue of the Gaussian maximizer.\nSimilar to the Holley-Stroock principle, we can show that in the stable regime\nthe Gaussian stationary point is optimal in a neighborhood under the\n$L^{\\infty}$-norm with respect to the Gaussian measure. For protocols with\nconstant power control, our counterexamples imply Gaussian suboptimality for\nthe Han-Kobayashi region. Allowing variable power control, we show that the\nGaussian optimizers for the Han-Kobayashi region always lie in the stable\nregime. We propose an amended conjecture, whose validity would imply Gaussian\noptimality of the Han-Kobayashi bound in a certain regime.",

However, the cyber security breach classification\nis still a difficult problem, even using cutting-edge artificial intelligence\n(AI) approaches. In this paper, we study the multi-class classification problem\nin cyber security for attack detection. A challenging multi-node data-censoring\ncase is considered. In such a case, data within each data center/node cannot be\nshared while the local data is incomplete. Particularly, local nodes contain\nonly a part of the multiple classes. In order to train a global multi-class\nclassifier without sharing the raw data across all nodes, the main result of\nour study is designing a multi-node multi-class classification ensemble\napproach. By gathering the estimated parameters of the binary classifiers and\ndata densities from each local node, the missing information for each local\nnode is completed to build the global multi-class classifier. Numerical\nexperiments are given to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach\nunder the multi-node data-censoring case.

However, the nature of repetition and\nstructure in music is still not well understood, especially in the context of\nmusic generation, and much remains to be explored with Music Information\nRetrieval (MIR) techniques. Analyses of two popular music datasets (Chinese and\nAmerican) illustrate important music construction principles: (1) structure\nexists at multiple hierarchical levels, (2) songs use repetition and limited\nvocabulary so that individual songs do not follow general statistics of song\ncollections, (3) structure interacts with rhythm, melody, harmony, and\npredictability, and (4) over the course of a song, repetition is not random,\nbut follows a general trend as revealed by cross-entropy. These and other\nfindings offer challenges as well as opportunities for deep-learning music\ngeneration and suggest new formal music criteria and evaluation methods. Music\nfrom recent music generation systems is analyzed and compared to human-composed\nmusic in our datasets, often revealing striking differences from a structural\nperspective.",

    "abstract": "Medical image classification has been widely adopted in medical image\nanalysis. However, due to the difficulty of collecting and labeling data in the\nmedical area, medical image datasets are usually highly-imbalanced. To address\nthis problem, previous works utilized class samples as prior for re-weighting\nor re-sampling but the feature representation is usually still not\ndiscriminative enough. In this paper, we adopt the contrastive learning to\ntackle the long-tailed medical imbalance problem. Specifically, we first\npropose the category prototype and adversarial proto-instance to generate\nrepresentative contrastive pairs. Then, the prototype recalibration strategy is\nproposed to address the highly imbalanced data distribution. Finally, a unified\nproto-loss is designed to train our framework. The overall framework, namely as\nPrototype-aware Contrastive learning (ProCo), is unified as a single-stage\npipeline in an end-to-end manner to alleviate the imbalanced problem in medical\nimage classification, which is also a distinct progress than existing works as\nthey follow the traditional two-stage pipeline.

    "title": "Hermes: Accelerating Long-Latency Load Requests via Perceptron-Based  Off-Chip Load Prediction",
    "abstract": "Long-latency load requests continue to limit the performance of\nhigh-performance processors. To increase the latency tolerance of a processor,\narchitects have primarily relied on two key techniques: sophisticated data\nprefetchers and large on-chip caches. In this work, we show that: 1) even a\nsophisticated state-of-the-art prefetcher can only predict half of the off-chip\nload requests on average across a wide range of workloads, and 2) due to the\nincreasing size and complexity of on-chip caches, a large fraction of the\nlatency of an off-chip load request is spent accessing the on-chip cache\nhierarchy. The goal of this work is to accelerate off-chip load requests by\nremoving the on-chip cache access latency from their critical path. To this\nend, we propose a new technique called Hermes, whose key idea is to: 1)\naccurately predict which load requests might go off-chip, and 2) speculatively\nfetch the data required by the predicted off-chip loads directly from the main\nmemory, while also concurrently accessing the cache hierarchy for such loads.\nTo enable Hermes, we develop a new lightweight, perceptron-based off-chip load\nprediction technique that learns to identify off-chip load requests using\nmultiple program features (e.g., sequence of program counters). For every load\nrequest, the predictor observes a set of program features to predict whether or\nnot the load would go off-chip. If the load is predicted to go off-chip, Hermes\nissues a speculative request directly to the memory controller once the load's\nphysical address is generated. If the prediction is correct, the load\neventually misses the cache hierarchy and waits for the ongoing speculative\nrequest to finish, thus hiding the on-chip cache hierarchy access latency from\nthe critical path of the off-chip load. Our evaluation shows that Hermes\nsignificantly improves performance of a state-of-the-art baseline. We\nopen-source Hermes.",

    "abstract": "As a significant ingredient regarding health status, data-driven\nstate-of-health (SOH) estimation has become dominant for lithium-ion batteries\n(LiBs). To handle data discrepancy across batteries, current SOH estimation\nmodels engage in transfer learning (TL), which reserves apriori knowledge\ngained through reusing partial structures of the offline trained model.\nHowever, multiple degradation patterns of a complete life cycle of a battery\nmake it challenging to pursue TL. The concept of the stage is introduced to\ndescribe the collection of continuous cycles that present a similar degradation\npattern. A transferable multi-stage SOH estimation model is proposed to perform\nTL across batteries in the same stage, consisting of four steps. First, with\nidentified stage information, raw cycling data from the source battery are\nreconstructed into the phase space with high dimensions, exploring hidden\ndynamics with limited sensors. Next, domain invariant representation across\ncycles in each stage is proposed through cycling discrepancy subspace with\nreconstructed data. Third, considering the unbalanced discharge cycles among\ndifferent stages, a switching estimation strategy composed of a lightweight\nmodel with the long short-term memory network and a powerful model with the\nproposed temporal capsule network is proposed to boost estimation accuracy.\nLastly, an updating scheme compensates for estimation errors when the cycling\nconsistency of target batteries drifts.

As rules in classical structured argumentation\nframeworks, p-rules form deduction systems. In addition, p-rules also represent\nconditional probabilities that define joint probability distributions. With PD\nframeworks, one performs probabilistic reasoning by solving Rule-Probabilistic\nSatisfiability. At the same time, one can obtain an argumentative reading to\nthe probabilistic reasoning with arguments and attacks. In this work, we\nintroduce a probabilistic version of the Closed-World Assumption (P-CWA) and\nprove that our probabilistic approach coincides with the complete extension in\nclassical argumentation under P-CWA and with maximum entropy reasoning. We\npresent several approaches to compute the joint probability distribution from\np-rules for achieving a practical proof theory for PD. PD provides a framework\nto unify probabilistic reasoning with argumentative reasoning. This is the\nfirst work in probabilistic structured argumentation where the joint\ndistribution is not assumed form external sources.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a two-grid temporal second-order scheme for the\ntwo-dimensional nonlinear Volterra integro-differential equation with weakly\nsingular kernel is proposed to reduce the computation time and improve the\naccuracy of the scheme developed by Xu et al. (Applied Numerical Mathematics\n152 (2020) 169-184). The proposed scheme consists of three steps: First, a\nsmall nonlinear system is solved on the coarse grid using fix-point iteration.\nSecond, the Lagrange's linear interpolation formula is used to arrive at some\nauxiliary values for analysis of the fine grid. Finally, a linearized\nCrank-Nicolson finite difference system is solved on the fine grid. Moreover,\nthe algorithm uses a central difference approximation for the spatial\nderivatives. In the time direction, the time derivative and integral term are\napproximated by Crank-Nicolson technique and product integral rule,\nrespectively. With the help of the discrete energy method, the stability and\nspace-time second-order convergence of the proposed approach are obtained in\n$L^2$-norm. Finally, the numerical results agree with the theoretical analysis\nand verify the effectiveness of the algorithm.",

This work illustrates how a dataset of Geo-tagged images from a\nmobile phone camera, can be used in navigating to the most convenient public\nparking lot in Johannesburg with an available parking space, detected by a\nneural network powered-public camera. The images are used to fine-tune a\nDetectron2 model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset to demonstrate detection\nand segmentation of vacant parking spots, we then add the parking lot's\ncorresponding longitude and latitude coordinates to recommend the most\nconvenient parking lot to the driver based on the Haversine distance and number\nof available parking spots. Using the VGG Image Annotation (VIA) we use 76\nimages from an expanding dataset of images, and annotate these with polygon\noutlines of the four different types of objects of interest: cars, open parking\nspots, people, and car number plates. We use the segmentation model to ensure\nnumber plates can be occluded in production for car registration anonymity\npurposes. We get an 89% and 82% intersection over union cover score on cars and\nparking spaces respectively. This work has the potential to help reduce the\namount of time commuters spend searching for free public parking, hence easing\ntraffic congestion in and around shopping complexes and other public places,\nand maximize people's utility with respect to driving on public roads.",

In particular, many of the\nhigh-performing dense retrieval models evaluate representations of query and\ndocument using BERT, and subsequently apply a cosine-similarity based scoring\nto determine the relevance. BERT representations, however, are known to follow\nan anisotropic distribution of a narrow cone shape and such an anisotropic\ndistribution can be undesirable for the cosine-similarity based scoring. In\nthis work, we first show that BERT-based DR also follows an anisotropic\ndistribution. To cope with the problem, we introduce unsupervised\npost-processing methods of Normalizing Flow and whitening, and develop\ntoken-wise method in addition to the sequence-wise method for applying the\npost-processing methods to the representations of dense retrieval models. We\nshow that the proposed methods can effectively enhance the representations to\nbe isotropic, then we perform experiments with ColBERT and RepBERT to show that\nthe performance (NDCG at 10) of document re-ranking can be improved by\n5.17\\%$\\sim$8.09\\% for ColBERT and 6.88\\%$\\sim$22.81\\% for RepBERT. To examine\nthe potential of isotropic representation for improving the robustness of DR\nmodels, we investigate out-of-distribution tasks where the test dataset differs\nfrom the training dataset. The results show that isotropic representation can\nachieve a generally improved performance. For instance, when training dataset\nis MS-MARCO and test dataset is Robust04, isotropy post-processing can improve\nthe baseline performance by up to 24.98\\%.

The lack of integration between\nphysical principles and data-driven models is an important reason for limiting\nthe development of this field. In the literature, physics-based methods can\nusually provide a clear interpretation of the dynamic process of traffic flow\nsystems but are with limited accuracy, while data-driven methods, especially\ndeep learning with black-box structures, can achieve improved performance but\ncan not be fully trusted due to lack of a reasonable physical basis. To bridge\nthe gap between purely data-driven and physics-driven approaches, we propose a\nphysics-guided deep learning model named Spatio-Temporal Differential Equation\nNetwork (STDEN), which casts the physical mechanism of traffic flow dynamics\ninto a deep neural network framework. Specifically, we assume the traffic flow\non road networks is driven by a latent potential energy field (like water flows\nare driven by the gravity field), and model the spatio-temporal dynamic process\nof the potential energy field as a differential equation network. STDEN absorbs\nboth the performance advantage of data-driven models and the interpretability\nof physics-based models, so is named a physics-guided prediction model.\nExperiments on three real-world traffic datasets in Beijing show that our model\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin.

    "abstract": "Continual relation extraction (CRE) requires the model to continually learn\nnew relations from class-incremental data streams. In this paper, we propose a\nFrustratingly easy but Effective Approach (FEA) method with two learning stages\nfor CRE: 1) Fast Adaption (FA) warms up the model with only new data. 2)\nBalanced Tuning (BT) finetunes the model on the balanced memory data. Despite\nits simplicity, FEA achieves comparable (on TACRED or superior (on FewRel)\nperformance compared with the state-of-the-art baselines. With careful\nexaminations, we find that the data imbalance between new and old relations\nleads to a skewed decision boundary in the head classifiers over the pretrained\nencoders, thus hurting the overall performance. In FEA, the FA stage unleashes\nthe potential of memory data for the subsequent finetuning, while the BT stage\nhelps establish a more balanced decision boundary. With a unified view, we find\nthat two strong CRE baselines can be subsumed into the proposed training\npipeline. The success of FEA also provides actionable insights and suggestions\nfor future model designing in CRE.",

    "abstract": "The visual quality of point clouds has been greatly emphasized since the\never-increasing 3D vision applications are expected to provide cost-effective\nand high-quality experiences for users. Looking back on the development of\npoint cloud quality assessment (PCQA) methods, the visual quality is usually\nevaluated by utilizing single-modal information, i.e., either extracted from\nthe 2D projections or 3D point cloud. The 2D projections contain rich texture\nand semantic information but are highly dependent on viewpoints, while the 3D\npoint clouds are more sensitive to geometry distortions and invariant to\nviewpoints. Therefore, to leverage the advantages of both point cloud and\nprojected image modalities, we propose a novel no-reference point cloud quality\nassessment (NR-PCQA) metric in a multi-modal fashion. In specific, we split the\npoint clouds into sub-models to represent local geometry distortions such as\npoint shift and down-sampling. Then we render the point clouds into 2D image\nprojections for texture feature extraction. To achieve the goals, the\nsub-models and projected images are encoded with point-based and image-based\nneural networks. Finally, symmetric cross-modal attention is employed to fuse\nmulti-modal quality-aware information. Experimental results show that our\napproach outperforms all compared state-of-the-art methods and is far ahead of\nprevious NR-PCQA methods, which highlights the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod.",

    "abstract": "The recently released IEEE 802.15.6 standard specifies several physical (PHY)\nlayers and medium access control (MAC) layer protocols for variety of medical\nand non-medical applications of Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN). The medical\napplications of WBAN has several obligatory requirements and constrains viz.\nhigh reliability, strict delay deadlines and low power consumption. The\nstandard IEEE 802.15.6 MAC scheme is not able to fulfil the all requirements of\nmedical applications of WBAN. To address this issue we propose an IEEE\n802.15.6-based MAC scheme that is the modification of superframe structure,\nuser priorities and access mechanism of standard IEEE 802.15.6 MAC scheme. The\nproposed superframe has three access phases: random access phases (RAP), manage\naccess phases (MAP) and contention access phase (CAP). The proposed four user\npriorities nodes access the channel during RAP using CAMA/CA mechanism with a\nlarge value of contention window. The proposed MAC scheme uses RTS/CTS access\nmechanism instead of basic access mechanism to mitigate the effect of hidden\nand expose terminal problem. Moreover, we develop an analytical model to\nevaluate the performance of proposed MAC scheme and solve the analytical model\nusing Maple. The results show that the modified IEEE 802.15.6 MAC scheme\nachieve the better performance in terms of reliability, throughput, average\naccess delay, energy consumption, channel utilization and fairness compared to\nstandard IEEE 802.15.6 MAC scheme in E-health applications.",

    "abstract": "Cybersecurity has become a primary global concern with the rapid increase in\nsecurity attacks and data breaches. Artificial intelligence is promising to\nhelp humans analyzing and identifying attacks. However, labeling millions of\npackets for supervised learning is never easy. This study aims to leverage\ntransfer learning technique that stores the knowledge gained from well-defined\nattack lifecycle documents and applies it to hundred thousands of unlabeled\nattacks (packets) for identifying their attack tactics. We anticipate the\nknowledge of an attack is well-described in the documents, and the cutting edge\ntransformer-based language model can embed the knowledge into a\nhigh-dimensional latent space. Then, reusing the information from the language\nmodel for the learning of attack tactic carried by packets to improve the\nlearning efficiency. We propose a system, PELAT, that fine-tunes BERT model\nwith 1,417 articles from MITRE ATT&CK lifecycle framework to enhance its attack\nknowledge (including syntax used and semantic meanings embedded). PELAT then\ntransfers its knowledge to perform semi-supervised learning for unlabeled\npackets to generate their tactic labels. Further, when a new attack packet\narrives, the packet payload will be processed by the PELAT language model with\na downstream classifier to predict its tactics. In this way, we can effectively\nreduce the burden of manually labeling big datasets. In a one-week honeypot\nattack dataset (227 thousand packets per day), PELAT performs 99% of precision,\nrecall, and F1 on testing dataset.

    "abstract": "Privacy issues on social networks have been extensively discussed in recent\nyears. The user identity linkage (UIL) task, aiming at finding corresponding\nusers across different social networks, would be a threat to privacy if\nunethically applied. The sensitive user information might be detected through\nconnected identities. A promising and novel solution to this issue is to design\nan adversarial strategy to degrade the matching performance of UIL models.\nHowever, most existing adversarial attacks on graphs are designed for models\nworking in a single network, while UIL is a cross-network learning task.\nMeanwhile, privacy protection against UIL works unilaterally in real-world\nscenarios, i.e., the service provider can only add perturbations to its own\nnetwork to protect its users from being linked. To tackle these challenges,\nthis paper proposes a novel adversarial attack strategy that poisons one target\nnetwork to prevent its nodes from being linked to other networks by UIL\nalgorithms. Specifically, we reformalize the UIL problem in the perspective of\nkernelized topology consistency and convert the attack objective to maximizing\nthe structural changes within the target network before and after attacks. A\nnovel graph kernel is then defined with Earth mover's distance (EMD) on the\nedge-embedding space. In terms of efficiency, a fast attack strategy is\nproposed by greedy searching and replacing EMD with its lower bound. Results on\nthree real-world datasets indicate that the proposed attacks can best fool a\nwide range of UIL models and reach a balance between attack effectiveness and\nimperceptibility.",

    "title": "Conditional graph entropy as an alternating minimization problem",
    "abstract": "The systematic study of alternating minimization problems was initiated by\nCsisz\\'ar and Tusn\\'ady. The area gained renewed interest recently due to its\napplications in machine learning. We will use this theory in the context of\nconditional graph entropy. The unconditioned version of this entropy notion was\nintroduced by K\\\"orner. The conditional version is important due to a result of\nOrlitsky and Roche showing that the minimal rate for a natural functional\ncompression problem (with side information at the receiver) is given by\nconditional graph entropy.\nIn this paper we show that conditional graph entropy can be formulated as an\nalternating minimization problem. More specifically, we present a function of\ntwo (vector-valued) variables such that, fixing any of the two variables, the\noptimal choice for the other variable can be expressed explicitly. Then\nminimizing in the fixed variable gives us the global minimum. Depending on\nwhich variable we start with, we get two different minimization problems with\nthe same optimum. In one case we get back the original formula for conditional\ngraph entropy. In the other we obtain a new formula. This new formula shows\nthat conditional graph entropy is part of a more general framework: the\nsolution of an optimization problem over a so-called convex corner. In the\nunconditioned case (i.e., graph entropy) this was known due to Csisz\\'ar,\nK\\\"orner, Lov\\'asz, Marton, and Simonyi. In that case the role of the convex\ncorner was played by the so-called vertex packing polytope. In the conditional\nversion it is a more intricate convex body but the function to minimize is the\nsame.\nFurthermore, if we alternate in optimally choosing one variable given the\nother, then we get a decreasing sequence of function values converging to the\nminimum, which allows one to numerically compute (conditional) graph entropy.",

    "abstract": "Creating a complex work of art like music necessitates profound creativity.\nWith recent advancements in deep learning and powerful models such as\ntransformers, there has been huge progress in automatic music generation. In an\naccompaniment generation context, creating a coherent drum pattern with\napposite fills and improvisations at proper locations in a song is a\nchallenging task even for an experienced drummer. Drum beats tend to follow a\nrepetitive pattern through stanzas with fills or improvisation at section\nboundaries. In this work, we tackle the task of drum pattern generation\nconditioned on the accompanying music played by four melodic instruments:\nPiano, Guitar, Bass, and Strings. We use the transformer sequence to sequence\nmodel to generate a basic drum pattern conditioned on the melodic accompaniment\nto find that improvisation is largely absent, attributed possibly to its\nexpectedly relatively low representation in the training data. We propose a\nnovelty function to capture the extent of improvisation in a bar relative to\nits neighbors. We train a model to predict improvisation locations from the\nmelodic accompaniment tracks. Finally, we use a novel BERT-inspired in-filling\narchitecture, to learn the structure of both the drums and melody to in-fill\nelements of improvised music.",

However, high-cost laser devices are not only difficult to deploy\nfor a large scale of robots but also demonstrate unsatisfactory robustness\ntowards the complex obstacles, including irregular obstacles, e.g., tables,\nchairs, and shelves, as well as complex ground and special materials. In this\npaper, we propose a novel monocular camera-based complex obstacle avoidance\nframework. Particularly, we innovatively transform the captured RGB images to\npseudo-laser measurements for efficient deep reinforcement learning. Compared\nto the traditional laser measurement captured at a certain height that only\ncontains one-dimensional distance information away from the neighboring\nobstacles, our proposed pseudo-laser measurement fuses the depth and semantic\ninformation of the captured RGB image, which makes our method effective for\ncomplex obstacles. We also design a feature extraction guidance module to\nweight the input pseudo-laser measurement, and the agent has more reasonable\nattention for the current state, which is conducive to improving the accuracy\nand efficiency of the obstacle avoidance policy.",

    "abstract": "Supervised machine learning provides state-of-the-art solutions to a wide\nrange of computer vision problems. However, the need for copious labelled\ntraining data limits the capabilities of these algorithms in scenarios where\nsuch input is scarce or expensive. Self-supervised learning offers a way to\nlower the need for manually annotated data by pretraining models for a specific\ndomain on unlabelled data. In this approach, labelled data are solely required\nto fine-tune models for downstream tasks. Medical image segmentation is a field\nwhere labelling data requires expert knowledge and collecting large labelled\ndatasets is challenging; therefore, self-supervised learning algorithms promise\nsubstantial improvements in this field. Despite this, self-supervised learning\nalgorithms are used rarely to pretrain medical image segmentation networks. In\nthis paper, we elaborate and analyse the effectiveness of supervised and\nself-supervised pretraining approaches on downstream medical image\nsegmentation, focusing on convergence and data efficiency. We find that\nself-supervised pretraining on natural images and target-domain-specific images\nleads to the fastest and most stable downstream convergence. In our experiments\non the ACDC cardiac segmentation dataset, this pretraining approach achieves\n4-5 times faster fine-tuning convergence compared to an ImageNet pretrained\nmodel. We also show that this approach requires less than five epochs of\npretraining on domain-specific data to achieve such improvement in the\ndownstream convergence time. Finally, we find that, in low-data scenarios,\nsupervised ImageNet pretraining achieves the best accuracy, requiring less than\n100 annotated samples to realise close to minimal error.",

However the computational effort required by\nsuch algorithms grows fast with the number of users and resources. Therefore,\npreallocation-based CA represents a promising approach for these setups. The\naim of preallocation is to constrain the number of bids submitted by\nparticipants in the CA process, thus allow the numerical feasibility of the\nauction problem. Reduction of bid number is achieved via limiting the number of\nitems (in our case channels) considered by auction participants (tenants) in\ntheir bids.

In addition to simple iterative\nrandom and semi-random algorithms which serve as baseline reference, we\nconsider the many-to-many version of the Gale-Shapley algorithm (M2MGS) and\nintroduce a relaxed version of the combinatorial auction algorithm (RCA) for\nthe preallocation stage, which allows the multiple allocation of single items.\nFurthermore, we analyze the optimal parametrization of the M2MGS and the RCA\npreallocation methods, and formulate recommendations for optimal performance\nbased on the analysis.",

Our framework integrates collapsibility information into our existing\ntraversability analysis, as vision and geometric information alone could be\nmisled by unpredictable non-rigid terrains such as soft soil, bush area, or\nwater puddles. With the new traversability analysis framework, our robot has a\nmore comprehensive assessment of unpredictable terrain, which is critical for\nits safety in outdoor environments. The pipeline first identifies the terrain's\ngeometric and semantic properties using an RGB-D camera and desired probing\nlocations on questionable terrains. These regions are probed using a force\nsensor to determine the risk of terrain collapsing when the robot steps over\nit. This risk is formulated as a collapsibility metric, which estimates an\nunpredictable region's ground collapsibility. Thereafter, the collapsibility\nmetric, together with geometric and semantic spatial data, is combined and\nanalyzed to produce global and local traversability grid maps. These\ntraversability grid maps tell the robot whether it is safe to step over\ndifferent regions of the map. The grid maps are then utilized to generate\noptimal paths for the robot to safely navigate to its goal.

    "abstract": "We propose a novel numerical method for the solution of the shallow water\nequations in different regimes of the Froude number making use of general\npolygonal meshes. The fluxes of the governing equations are split such that\nadvection and acoustic-gravity sub-systems are derived, hence separating slow\nand fast phenomena. This splitting allows the nonlinear convective fluxes to be\ndiscretized explicitly in time, while retaining an implicit time marching for\nthe acoustic-gravity terms. Consequently, the novel schemes are particularly\nwell suited in the low Froude limit of the model, since no numerical viscosity\nis added in the implicit solver. Besides, stability follows from a milder CFL\ncondition which is based only on the advection speed and not on the celerity.\nHigh order time accuracy is achieved using the family of semi-implicit IMEX\nRunge-Kutta schemes, while high order in space is granted relying on two\ndiscretizations: (i) a cell-centered finite volume (FV) scheme for the\nnonlinear convective contribution on the polygonal cells; (ii) a staggered\ndiscontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme for the solution of the linear system\nassociated to the implicit discretization of the pressure sub-system.\nTherefore, three different meshes are used, namely a polygonal Voronoi mesh, a\ntriangular subgrid and a staggered quadrilateral subgrid. The novel schemes are\nproved to be Asymptotic Preserving (AP), hence a consistent discretization of\nthe limit model is retrieved for vanishing Froude numbers, which is the given\nby the so-called \"lake at rest\" equations. Furthermore, the novel methods are\nwell-balanced by construction, and this property is also demonstrated. Accuracy\nand robustness are then validated against a set of benchmark test cases with\nFroude numbers ranging in the interval $\\Fr \\approx [10^{-6};5]$, hence showing\nthat multiple time scales can be handled by the novel methods.",

    "abstract": "A key challenge of continual reinforcement learning (CRL) in dynamic\nenvironments is to promptly adapt the RL agent's behavior as the environment\nchanges over its lifetime, while minimizing the catastrophic forgetting of the\nlearned information. To address this challenge, in this article, we propose\nDaCoRL, i.e., dynamics-adaptive continual RL. DaCoRL learns a\ncontext-conditioned policy using progressive contextualization, which\nincrementally clusters a stream of stationary tasks in the dynamic environment\ninto a series of contexts and opts for an expandable multihead neural network\nto approximate the policy. Specifically, we define a set of tasks with similar\ndynamics as an environmental context and formalize context inference as a\nprocedure of online Bayesian infinite Gaussian mixture clustering on\nenvironment features, resorting to online Bayesian inference to infer the\nposterior distribution over contexts. Under the assumption of a Chinese\nrestaurant process prior, this technique can accurately classify the current\ntask as a previously seen context or instantiate a new context as needed\nwithout relying on any external indicator to signal environmental changes in\nadvance. Furthermore, we employ an expandable multihead neural network whose\noutput layer is synchronously expanded with the newly instantiated context, and\na knowledge distillation regularization term for retaining the performance on\nlearned tasks. As a general framework that can be coupled with various deep RL\nalgorithms, DaCoRL features consistent superiority over existing methods in\nterms of the stability, overall performance and generalization ability, as\nverified by extensive experiments on several robot navigation and MuJoCo\nlocomotion tasks.",

Second, we develop a graphical user interface which allows\nusers to select different styles of chord progression and piano texture.\nCurrently, chord progression styles include Pop, R&B, and Dark, while piano\ntexture styles include several levels of voicing density and rhythmic\ncomplexity. Experimental results show that both our harmonization and\narrangement results significantly outperform the baselines.

Current methods that obtain state-of-the-art\nperformance on in-the-lab benchmarks achieve much worse accuracy on the\nrecently proposed in-the-wild datasets because these methods can hardly model\nthe varied temporal dynamics of gait sequences in unconstrained scenes.\nTherefore, this paper presents a novel multi-hop temporal switch method to\nachieve effective temporal modeling of gait patterns in real-world scenes.\nConcretely, we design a novel gait recognition network, named Multi-hop\nTemporal Switch Network (MTSGait), to learn spatial features and multi-scale\ntemporal features simultaneously. Different from existing methods that use 3D\nconvolutions for temporal modeling, our MTSGait models the temporal dynamics of\ngait sequences by 2D convolutions. By this means, it achieves high efficiency\nwith fewer model parameters and reduces the difficulty in optimization compared\nwith 3D convolution-based models. Based on the specific design of the 2D\nconvolution kernels, our method can eliminate the misalignment of features\namong adjacent frames. In addition, a new sampling strategy, i.e., non-cyclic\ncontinuous sampling, is proposed to make the model learn more robust temporal\nfeatures.

For unsupervised object discovery, this approach\noutperforms the competing approaches by a margin of 6.1%, 5.7%, and 2.6%,\nrespectively, when tested with the VOC07, VOC12, and COCO20K datasets. For the\nunsupervised saliency detection task in images, this method improves the score\nfor Intersection over Union (IoU) by 4.4%, 5.6% and 5.2%. When tested with the\nECSSD, DUTS, and DUT-OMRON datasets, respectively, compared to current\nstate-of-the-art techniques. This method also achieves competitive results for\nunsupervised video object segmentation tasks with the DAVIS, SegTV2, and FBMS\ndatasets.",

    "title": "Secrecy Analysis for IRS-aided Wiretap MIMO Communications: Fundamental  Limits and System Design",
    "abstract": "In order to meet the demands of future innovative applications, many efforts\nhave been made to exceed the limits predicted by Shannon's Theory. Besides the\ninvestigation of beyond-Shannon metrics such as security, latency, and\nsemantics, another direction is to jointly design the transceiver and the\nenvironment by utilizing the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS). In this\npaper, we consider the analysis and design of IRS-aided multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO) secure communications, which has attracted much research\nattention but still in its infancy. For example, despite their importance, the\nfundamental limits of IRS-aided wiretap MIMO communications are not yet\navailable in the literature. In this paper, we will investigate these\nfundamental limits by determining the ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) and secrecy\noutage probability (SOP). For that purpose, the central limit theorem (CLT) for\nthe joint distributions of the mutual information (MI) statistics over the\nIRS-aided MIMO secure communication channel is derived by utilizing the random\nmatrix theory (RMT). The derived CLT is then used to obtain the closed form\nexpressions for the ESR and SOP, which are also extended to the scenario with\nmultiple multi-antenna eavesdroppers. Based on the theoretical results,\nalgorithms for maximizing the artificial noise (AN) aided ESR and minimizing\nthe SOP are proposed. Numerical results validate the accuracy of the\ntheoretical results and effectiveness of the proposed optimization algorithms.",

    "abstract": "To enhance the compatibility in the version control of Java Third-party\nLibraries (TPLs), Maven adopts Semantic Versioning (SemVer) to standardize the\nunderlying meaning of versions, but users could still confront abnormal\nexecution and crash after upgrades even if compilation and linkage succeed. It\nis caused by semantic breaking (SemB) issues, such that APIs directly used by\nusers have identical signatures but inconsistent semantics across upgrades. To\nstrengthen compliance with SemVer rules, developers and users should be alerted\nof such issues. Unfortunately, it is challenging to detect them statically,\nbecause semantic changes in the internal methods of APIs are difficult to\ncapture. Dynamic testing can confirmingly uncover some, but it is limited by\ninadequate coverage.\nTo detect SemB issues over compatible upgrades (Patch and Minor) by SemVer\nrules, we conduct an empirical study on 180 SemB issues to understand the root\ncauses, inspired by which, we propose Sembid (Semantic Breaking Issue Detector)\nto statically detect such issues of TPLs for developers and users. Since APIs\nare directly used by users, Sembid detects and reports SemB issues based on\nAPIs. For a pair of APIs, Sembid walks through the call chains originating from\nthe API to locate breaking changes by measuring semantic diff. Then, Sembid\nchecks if the breaking changes can affect API's output along call chains. The\nevaluation showed Sembid achieved 90.26% recall and 81.29% precision and\noutperformed other API checkers on SemB API detection. We also revealed Sembid\ndetected over 3 times more SemB APIs with better coverage than unit tests, the\ncommonly used solution. Furthermore, we carried out an empirical study on\n1,629,589 APIs from 546 version pairs of top Java libraries and found there\nwere 2-4 times more SemB APIs than those with signature-based issues.",

    "abstract": "Recognizing human actions from point cloud videos has attracted tremendous\nattention from both academia and industry due to its wide applications like\nautomatic driving, robotics, and so on. However, current methods for point\ncloud action recognition usually require a huge amount of data with manual\nannotations and a complex backbone network with high computation costs, which\nmakes it impractical for real-world applications. Therefore, this paper\nconsiders the task of semi-supervised point cloud action recognition. We\npropose a Masked Pseudo-Labeling autoEncoder (\\textbf{MAPLE}) framework to\nlearn effective representations with much fewer annotations for point cloud\naction recognition. In particular, we design a novel and efficient\n\\textbf{De}coupled \\textbf{s}patial-\\textbf{t}emporal Trans\\textbf{Former}\n(\\textbf{DestFormer}) as the backbone of MAPLE. In DestFormer, the spatial and\ntemporal dimensions of the 4D point cloud videos are decoupled to achieve\nefficient self-attention for learning both long-term and short-term features.\nMoreover, to learn discriminative features from fewer annotations, we design a\nmasked pseudo-labeling autoencoder structure to guide the DestFormer to\nreconstruct features of masked frames from the available frames. More\nimportantly, for unlabeled data, we exploit the pseudo-labels from the\nclassification head as the supervision signal for the reconstruction of\nfeatures from the masked frames. Finally, comprehensive experiments demonstrate\nthat MAPLE achieves superior results on three public benchmarks and outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art method by 8.08\\% accuracy on the MSR-Action3D dataset.",

    "title": "Efficient ML Models for Practical Secure Inference",
    "abstract": "ML-as-a-service continues to grow, and so does the need for very strong\nprivacy guarantees. Secure inference has emerged as a potential solution,\nwherein cryptographic primitives allow inference without revealing users'\ninputs to a model provider or model's weights to a user. For instance, the\nmodel provider could be a diagnostics company that has trained a\nstate-of-the-art DenseNet-121 model for interpreting a chest X-ray and the user\ncould be a patient at a hospital. While secure inference is in principle\nfeasible for this setting, there are no existing techniques that make it\npractical at scale. The CrypTFlow2 framework provides a potential solution with\nits ability to automatically and correctly translate clear-text inference to\nsecure inference for arbitrary models. However, the resultant secure inference\nfrom CrypTFlow2 is impractically expensive: Almost 3TB of communication is\nrequired to interpret a single X-ray on DenseNet-121. In this paper, we address\nthis outstanding challenge of inefficiency of secure inference with three\ncontributions. First, we show that the primary bottlenecks in secure inference\nare large linear layers which can be optimized with the choice of network\nbackbone and the use of operators developed for efficient clear-text inference.\nThis finding and emphasis deviates from many recent works which focus on\noptimizing non-linear activation layers when performing secure inference of\nsmaller networks. Second, based on analysis of a bottle-necked convolution\nlayer, we design a X-operator which is a more efficient drop-in replacement.\nThird, we show that the fast Winograd convolution algorithm further improves\nefficiency of secure inference. In combination, these three optimizations prove\nto be highly effective for the problem of X-ray interpretation trained on the\nCheXpert dataset.",

In this work,\nparticipants were asked to approach and touch a humanoid robot on the hand (Nao\n-- 26 participants; Pepper -- 28 participants) to get its attention. We\ndesigned reaction behaviors for the robot that consisted in four different\ncombinations of arm movements with the touched hand moving forward or back and\nthe other hand moving forward or staying in place, with simultaneous leaning\nback, followed by looking at the participant. We studied which reaction of the\nrobot people found the most appropriate and what was the reason for their\nchoice. For both robots, the preferred reaction of the robot hand being touched\nwas moving back. For the other hand, no movement at all was rated most natural\nfor the Pepper, while it was movement forward for the Nao. A correlation\nbetween the anxiety subscale of the participants' personality traits and the\npassive to active/aggressive nature of the robot reactions was found. Most\nparticipants noticed the leaning back and rated it positively. Looking at the\nparticipant was commented on positively by some participants in unstructured\ncomments. We also analyzed where and how participants spontaneously touched the\nrobot on the hand. In summary, the touch reaction behaviors designed here are\ngood candidates to be deployed more generally in social robots, possibly\nincluding incidental touch in crowded environments.

Specifically, the UAV is required to collect a fixed amount of\ninformation of each target by hovering at a pre-determined location (via e.g.,\nphotography/videography/sensing), and transmit all the collected information to\nthe cellular network during its flight. We aim to jointly optimize the UAV's\ntrajectory and the information collection order of the ground targets to\nminimize the mission completion time. The formulated problem is NP-hard due to\nthe need of visiting the information collection locations for all targets;\nmoreover, the UAV's trajectories over different time durations are coupled in\nnon-convex constraints for ensuring information transmission completion. To\nhandle this difficult problem, we first propose a structured communication\nprotocol between the UAV and the cellular network, which decouples the UAV's\ntrajectory designs in different time durations. Then, under the proposed\nprotocol, we establish an equivalent graph-based model for the considered\nproblem, and devise a low-complexity algorithm for finding an approximate\nsolution by exploiting the problem structure and leveraging graph theory.\nNumerical results show that our proposed design achieves efficient information\ncollection and transmission, and outperforms various benchmark schemes.",

    "abstract": "The Pseudo-haptic technique is used to modify haptic perception by\nappropriately changing visual feedback to body movements. Because tendon\nvibration can affect our somatosensory perception, we propose a method for\nleveraging tendon vibration to extend pseudo-haptics. To evaluate the proposed\nmethod, we conducted three experiments that investigate the effect of tendon\nvibration on the range and resolution of pseudo-haptic sensation. The first\nexperiment evaluated the effect of tendon vibration on the detection threshold\n(DT) of visual/physical motion discrepancy. The results show that vibrations on\nthe inner tendons of the wrist and elbow increased the DT. This indicates that\ntendon vibration can increase applicable visual motion gain without being\nnoticed by users. The second experiment investigated the effect of tendon\nvibration on the resolution, that is, the just noticeable difference (JND) of\npseudo-weight sensation. The results indicate that both with- and\nwithout-vibration conditions had a similar JND of pseudo-weight sensation and\nthus, both conditions can be considered to have a similar resolution of sense\nof weight. The third experiment investigated the equivalence between the weight\nsensation induced by tendon vibration and visual motion gain, that is, the\npoint of subjective equality (PSE). The results show that vibration increases\nthe sense of weight, and its effect was the same as that using a gain of 0.64\nwithout vibration. Taken together, our results suggest that using tendon\nvibration can enable a significantly wider (nearly double) range of\npseudo-haptic sensation, without impairing its resolution.",

(which we will refer to as\nDL2SP from now on) for both within- and cross-project estimation scenarios, and\nevaluated the extent to which each components of GPT2SP contribute towards the\naccuracy of the SP estimates. Their results show that GPT2SP outperforms DL2SP\nwith a 6%-47% improvement over MAE for the within-project scenario and a 3%-46%\nimprovement for the cross-project scenarios. However, when we attempted to use\nthe GPT2SP source code made available by Fu and Tantithamthavorn to reproduce\ntheir experiments, we found a bug in the computation of the Mean Absolute Error\n(MAE), which may have inflated the GPT2SP's accuracy reported in their work.\nTherefore, we had issued a pull request to fix such a bug, which has been\naccepted and merged into their repository at\nhttps://github.com/awsm-research/gpt2sp/pull/2.\nIn this report, we describe the results we achieved by using the fixed\nversion of GPT2SP to replicate the experiments conducted in the original paper\nfor RQ1 and RQ2. Following the original study, we analyse the results\nconsidering the Medan Absolute Error (MAE) of the estimation methods over all\nissues in each project, but we also report the Median Absolute Error (MdAE) and\nthe Standard accuracy (SA) for completeness.",

    "abstract": "Ensembling neural networks is a long-standing technique for improving the\ngeneralization error of neural networks by combining networks with orthogonal\nproperties via a committee decision. We show that this technique is an ideal\nfit for machine learning on medical data: First, ensembles are amenable to\nparallel and asynchronous learning, thus enabling efficient training of\npatient-specific component neural networks. Second, building on the idea of\nminimizing generalization error by selecting uncorrelated patient-specific\nnetworks, we show that one can build an ensemble of a few selected\npatient-specific models that outperforms a single model trained on much larger\npooled datasets. Third, the non-iterative ensemble combination step is an\noptimal low-dimensional entry point to apply output perturbation to guarantee\nthe privacy of the patient-specific networks.

    "abstract": "One of the main methods for semantic interpretation of text is mapping it\ninto a vector in some embedding space. Such vectors can then be used for a\nvariety of text processing tasks. Recently, most embedding spaces are a product\nof training large language models. One major drawback of this type of\nrepresentation is its incomprehensibility to humans. Understanding the\nembedding space is crucial for several important needs, including the need to\nexplain the decision of a system that uses the embedding, the need to debug the\nembedding method and compare it to alternatives, and the need to detect biases\nhidden in the model. In this paper, we present a novel method of transforming\nany embedding space into a comprehensible conceptual space. We first present an\nalgorithm for deriving a conceptual space with dynamic on-demand granularity.\nWe then show a method for transferring any vector in the original\nincomprehensible space to an understandable vector in the conceptual space. We\ncombine human tests with cross-model tests to show that the conceptualized\nvectors indeed represent the semantics of the original vectors. We also show\nhow the conceptualized vectors can be used for various tasks including\nidentifying weaknesses in the semantics underlying the original spaces and\ndifferences in the semantics of alternative models.",

Hence, we propose a new approach for retrieval of mathematical\nexpressions based on machine learning. We design an unsupervised representation\nlearning task that combines embedding learning with self-supervised learning.\nUsing graph convolutional neural networks we embed mathematical expression into\nlow-dimensional vector spaces that allow efficient nearest neighbor queries.

    "abstract": "Like many team sports, basketball involves two groups of players who engage\nin collaborative and adversarial activities to win a game. Players and teams\nare executing various complex strategies to gain an advantage over their\nopponents. Defining, identifying, and analyzing different types of activities\nis an important task in sports analytics, as it can lead to better strategies\nand decisions by the players and coaching staff. The objective of this paper is\nto automatically recognize basketball group activities from tracking data\nrepresenting locations of players and the ball during a game. We propose a\nnovel deep learning approach for group activity recognition (GAR) in team\nsports called NETS. To efficiently model the player relations in team sports,\nwe combined a Transformer-based architecture with LSTM embedding, and a\nteam-wise pooling layer to recognize the group activity. Training such a neural\nnetwork generally requires a large amount of annotated data, which incurs high\nlabeling cost. To address scarcity of manual labels, we generate weak-labels\nand pretrain the neural network on a self-supervised trajectory prediction\ntask. We used a large tracking data set from 632 NBA games to evaluate our\napproach. The results show that NETS is capable of learning group activities\nwith high accuracy, and that self- and weak-supervised training in NETS have a\npositive impact on GAR accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by dynamic graph visualization, we study the problem of\nrepresenting a graph $G$ in the form of a \\emph{storyplan}, that is, a sequence\nof frames with the following properties. Each frame is a planar drawing of the\nsubgraph of $G$ induced by a suitably defined subset of its vertices. Between\ntwo consecutive frames, a new vertex appears while some other vertices may\ndisappear, namely those whose incident edges have already been drawn in at\nleast one frame. In a storyplan, each vertex appears and disappears exactly\nonce. For a vertex (edge) visible in a sequence of consecutive frames, the\npoint (curve) representing it does not change throughout the sequence.\nNote that the order in which the vertices of $G$ appear in the sequence of\nframes is a total order. In the \\textsc{StoryPlan} problem, we are given a\ngraph and we want to decide whether there exists a total order of its vertices\nfor which a storyplan exists. We prove that the problem is NP-complete, and\ncomplement this hardness with two parameterized algorithms, one in the vertex\ncover number and one in the feedback edge set number of $G$. Also, we prove\nthat partial $3$-trees always admit a storyplan, which can be computed in\nlinear time. Finally, we show that the problem remains NP-complete in the case\nin which the total order of the vertices is given as part of the input and we\nhave to choose how to draw the frames.",

In this paper, we propose to incorporate contrastive learning into the\nframework of Variational AutoEncoders to address these challenges\nsimultaneously.

    "abstract": "Using artificial intelligence (AI) to automatically test a game remains a\ncritical challenge for the development of richer and more complex game worlds\nand for the advancement of AI at large. One of the most promising methods for\nachieving that long-standing goal is the use of generative AI agents, namely\nprocedural personas, that attempt to imitate particular playing behaviors which\nare represented as rules, rewards, or human demonstrations. All research\nefforts for building those generative agents, however, have focused solely on\nplaying behavior which is arguably a narrow perspective of what a player\nactually does in a game. Motivated by this gap in the existing state of the\nart, in this paper we extend the notion of behavioral procedural personas to\ncater for player experience, thus examining generative agents that can both\nbehave and experience their game as humans would. For that purpose, we employ\nthe Go-Explore reinforcement learning paradigm for training human-like\nprocedural personas, and we test our method on behavior and experience\ndemonstrations of more than 100 players of a racing game. Our findings suggest\nthat the generated agents exhibit distinctive play styles and experience\nresponses of the human personas they were designed to imitate. Importantly, it\nalso appears that experience, which is tied to playing behavior, can be a\nhighly informative driver for better behavioral exploration.",

Safety\nand risk assessment of systems are strongly correlated with the accuracy of\nmeasurements: Distinctive parameters are often not directly accessible via\nknown models and must therefore be measured. However, measurements generally\nsuffer from uncertainties due to the limited performance of sensors, even\nunknown environmental disturbances, or humans. In this work, we quantify these\nmeasurement uncertainties by making use of conservation measures which are\nquantitative, system specific properties that are constant over time, space, or\nother state space dimensions. The key idea of our method lies in the immediate\ndata evaluation of incoming data during run-time referring to conservation\nequations. In particular, we estimate violations of a-priori known, domain\nspecific conservation properties and consider them as the consequence of\nmeasurement uncertainties. We validate our method on a use case in the context\nof human-robot collaboration, thereby highlighting the importance of our\ncontribution for the successful development of safe robot systems under\nreal-world conditions, e.g., in industrial environments.

    "abstract": "Automatic medical question summarization can significantly help the system to\nunderstand consumer health questions and retrieve correct answers. The Seq2Seq\nmodel based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) has been applied in this\ntask, which faces two general problems: the model can not capture well question\nfocus and and the traditional MLE strategy lacks the ability to understand\nsentence-level semantics. To alleviate these problems, we propose a novel\nquestion focus-driven contrastive learning framework (QFCL). Specially, we\npropose an easy and effective approach to generate hard negative samples based\non the question focus, and exploit contrastive learning at both encoder and\ndecoder to obtain better sentence level representations. On three medical\nbenchmark datasets, our proposed model achieves new state-of-the-art results,\nand obtains a performance gain of 5.33, 12.85 and 3.81 points over the baseline\nBART model on three datasets respectively. Further human judgement and detailed\nanalysis prove that our QFCL model learns better sentence representations with\nthe ability to distinguish different sentence meanings, and generates\nhigh-quality summaries by capturing question focus.",

    "abstract": "Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent\nsurfaces (STAR-RISs) is a promising passive device that contributes to a\nfull-space coverage via transmitting and reflecting the incident signal\nsimultaneously. As a new paradigm in wireless communications, how to analyze\nthe coverage and capacity performance of STAR-RISs becomes essential but\nchallenging. To solve the coverage and capacity optimization (CCO) problem in\nSTAR-RIS assisted networks, a multi-objective proximal policy optimization\n(MO-PPO) algorithm is proposed to handle long-term benefits than conventional\noptimization algorithms. To strike a balance between each objective, the MO-PPO\nalgorithm provides a set of optimal solutions to form a Pareto front (PF),\nwhere any solution on the PF is regarded as an optimal result. Moreover, in\norder to improve the performance of the MO-PPO algorithm, two update\nstrategies, i.e., action-value-based update strategy (AVUS) and loss\nfunction-based update strategy (LFUS), are investigated. For the AVUS, the\nimproved point is to integrate the action values of both coverage and capacity\nand then update the loss function. For the LFUS, the improved point is only to\nassign dynamic weights for both loss functions of coverage and capacity, while\nthe weights are calculated by a min-norm solver at every update. The numerical\nresults demonstrated that the investigated update strategies outperform the\nfixed weights MO optimization algorithms in different cases, which includes a\ndifferent number of sample grids, the number of STAR-RISs, the number of\nelements in the STAR-RISs, and the size of STAR-RISs. Additionally, the\nSTAR-RIS assisted networks achieve better performance than conventional\nwireless networks without STAR-RISs. Moreover, with the same bandwidth,\nmillimeter wave is able to provide higher capacity than sub-6 GHz, but at a\ncost of smaller coverage.",

    "abstract": "Equilibrium propagation (EP) is an alternative to backpropagation (BP) that\nallows the training of deep neural networks with local learning rules. It thus\nprovides a compelling framework for training neuromorphic systems and\nunderstanding learning in neurobiology. However, EP requires infinitesimal\nteaching signals, thereby limiting its applicability in noisy physical systems.\nMoreover, the algorithm requires separate temporal phases and has not been\napplied to large-scale problems. Here we address these issues by extending EP\nto holomorphic networks. We show analytically that this extension naturally\nleads to exact gradients even for finite-amplitude teaching signals.\nImportantly, the gradient can be computed as the first Fourier coefficient from\nfinite neuronal activity oscillations in continuous time without requiring\nseparate phases. Further, we demonstrate in numerical simulations that our\napproach permits robust estimation of gradients in the presence of noise and\nthat deeper models benefit from the finite teaching signals. Finally, we\nestablish the first benchmark for EP on the ImageNet 32x32 dataset and show\nthat it matches the performance of an equivalent network trained with BP. Our\nwork provides analytical insights that enable scaling EP to large-scale\nproblems and establishes a formal framework for how oscillations could support\nlearning in biological and neuromorphic systems.",

    "abstract": "A widely-studied deep reinforcement learning (RL) technique known as\nPrioritized Experience Replay (PER) allows agents to learn from transitions\nsampled with non-uniform probability proportional to their temporal-difference\n(TD) error. Although it has been shown that PER is one of the most crucial\ncomponents for the overall performance of deep RL methods in discrete action\ndomains, many empirical studies indicate that it considerably underperforms\nactor-critic algorithms in continuous control. We theoretically show that actor\nnetworks cannot be effectively trained with transitions that have large TD\nerrors. As a result, the approximate policy gradient computed under the\nQ-network diverges from the actual gradient computed under the optimal\nQ-function. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel experience replay sampling\nframework for actor-critic methods, which also regards issues with stability\nand recent findings behind the poor empirical performance of PER. The\nintroduced algorithm suggests a new branch of improvements to PER and schedules\neffective and efficient training for both actor and critic networks. An\nextensive set of experiments verifies our theoretical claims and demonstrates\nthat the introduced method significantly outperforms the competing approaches\nand obtains state-of-the-art results over the standard off-policy actor-critic\nalgorithms.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a predictor-corrector strategy for constructing\nrank-adaptive, dynamical low-rank approximations (DLRAs) of matrix-valued ODE\nsystems. The strategy is a compromise between (i) low-rank step-truncation\napproaches that alternately evolve and compress solutions and (ii) strict DLRA\napproaches that augment the low-rank manifold using subspaces generated locally\nin time by the DLRA integrator. The strategy is based on an analysis of the\nerror between a forward temporal update into the ambient full-rank space, which\nis typically computed in a step-truncation approach before re-compressing, and\nthe standard DLRA update, which is forced to live in a low-rank manifold. We\nuse this error, without requiring its full-rank representation, to correct the\nDLRA solution. A key ingredient for maintaining a low-rank representation of\nthe error is a randomized singular value decomposition (SVD), which introduces\nsome degree of stochastic variability into the implementation. The strategy is\nformulated and implemented in the context of discontinuous Galerkin spatial\ndiscretizations of partial differential equations and applied to several\nversions of DLRA methods found in the literature, as well as a new variant.\nNumerical experiments comparing predictor-corrector strategy to other methods\ndemonstrate robustness the overcome short-comings of step truncation or strict\nDLRA approaches: the former may require more memory than is strictly needed\nwhile the latter may miss transients solution features that cannot be\nrecovered.

    "abstract": "Remote sensor image object detection is an important technology for Earth\nobservation, and is used in various tasks such as forest fire monitoring and\nocean monitoring. Image object detection technology, despite the significant\ndevelopments, is struggling to handle remote sensor images and small-scale\nobjects, due to the limited pixels of small objects. Numerous existing studies\nhave demonstrated that an effective way to promote small object detection is to\nintroduce the spatial context. Meanwhile, recent researches for image\nclassification have shown that spectral convolution operations can perceive\nlong-term spatial dependence more efficiently in the frequency domain than\nspatial domain. Inspired by this observation, we propose a Frequency-aware\nFeature Pyramid Framework (FFPF) for remote sensing object detection, which\nconsists of a novel Frequency-aware ResNet (F-ResNet) and a Bilateral\nSpectral-aware Feature Pyramid Network (BS-FPN). Specifically, the F-ResNet is\nproposed to perceive the spectral context information by plugging the frequency\ndomain convolution into each stage of the backbone, extracting richer features\nof small objects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to\nintroduce frequency-domain convolution into remote sensing object detection\ntask. In addition, the BSFPN is designed to use a bilateral sampling strategy\nand skipping connection to better model the association of object features at\ndifferent scales, towards unleashing the potential of the spectral context\ninformation from F-ResNet. Extensive experiments are conducted for object\ndetection in the optical remote sensing image dataset (DIOR and DOTA). The\nexperimental results demonstrate the excellent performance of our method.

The metaverse constitutes an emerging social\nimaginary, a way of both understanding and directing our shared existence.

Each job has a size and each machine has a\nspeed, and the load due to a job assigned to a machine is obtained by dividing\nthe first value by the second. The goal is to minimize the maximum overall load\nany machine receives. However, unlike in the pure online case, each time a new\njob arrives it contributes a migration potential equal to the product of its\nsize and a certain migration factor. This potential can be spend to reassign\njobs either right away (non-amortized case) or at any later time (amortized\ncase). Semi-online models of this flavor have been studied intensively for\nseveral fundamental problems, e.g., load balancing on identical machines and\nbin packing, but uniformly related machines have not been considered up to now.\nIn the present paper, the classical doubling strategy on uniformly related\nmachines is combined with migration to achieve an\n$(8/3+\\varepsilon)$-competitive algorithm and a $(4+\\varepsilon)$-competitive\nalgorithm with $O(1/\\varepsilon)$ amortized and non-amortized migration,\nrespectively, while the best known competitive ratio in the pure online setting\nis roughly $5.828$.",

Learning how to fuse this information has proved\nchallenging for transformer-based language models. Therefore, we present MulCo:\nMulti-Scale Contrastive Co-Training, a technique for the better fusion of local\nand global contextualized features.

The ability of these\nsystems to complete these tasks depends on a large range of technologies such\nas the mechanical and electrical parts that make up the physical body of the\nrobot and its sensors, perception algorithms to perceive the environment, and\nplanning and control algorithms to produce meaningful actions. Therefore, it is\noften necessary to consider the interactions between these components when\ndesigning an embodied system. This thesis explores work on the task-driven\nco-optimization of robotics systems in an end-to-end manner, simultaneously\noptimizing the physical components of the system with inference or control\nalgorithms directly for task performance. We start by considering the problem\nof optimizing a beacon-based localization system directly for localization\naccuracy. Designing such a system involves placing beacons throughout the\nenvironment and inferring location from sensor readings. In our work, we\ndevelop a deep learning approach to optimize both beacon placement and location\ninference directly for localization accuracy. We then turn our attention to the\nrelated problem of task-driven optimization of robots and their controllers. In\nour work, we start by proposing a data-efficient algorithm based on multi-task\nreinforcement learning. Our approach efficiently optimizes both physical design\nand control parameters directly for task performance by leveraging a\ndesign-conditioned controller capable of generalizing over the space of\nphysical designs. We then follow this up with an extension to allow for the\noptimization over discrete morphological parameters such as the number and\nconfiguration of limbs.

Recently, many\nmodel-based methods have been designed to address this issue, with learning in\nthe imagination of a world model being one of the most prominent approaches.\nHowever, while virtually unlimited interaction with a simulated environment\nsounds appealing, the world model has to be accurate over extended periods of\ntime. Motivated by the success of Transformers in sequence modeling tasks, we\nintroduce IRIS, a data-efficient agent that learns in a world model composed of\na discrete autoencoder and an autoregressive Transformer.

    "abstract": "Many contextualized word representations are now learned by intricate neural\nnetwork models, such as masked neural language models (MNLMs) which are made up\nof huge neural network structures and trained to restore the masked text. Such\nrepresentations demonstrate superhuman performance in some reading\ncomprehension (RC) tasks which extract a proper answer in the context given a\nquestion. However, identifying the detailed knowledge trained in MNLMs is\nchallenging owing to numerous and intermingled model parameters. This paper\nprovides new insights and empirical analyses on commonsense knowledge included\nin pretrained MNLMs. First, we use a diagnostic test that evaluates whether\ncommonsense knowledge is properly trained in MNLMs. We observe that a large\nproportion of commonsense knowledge is not appropriately trained in MNLMs and\nMNLMs do not often understand the semantic meaning of relations accurately. In\naddition, we find that the MNLM-based RC models are still vulnerable to\nsemantic variations that require commonsense knowledge. Finally, we discover\nthe fundamental reason why some knowledge is not trained. We further suggest\nthat utilizing an external commonsense knowledge repository can be an effective\nsolution. We exemplify the possibility to overcome the limitations of the\nMNLM-based RC models by enriching text with the required knowledge from an\nexternal commonsense knowledge repository in controlled experiments.",

    "title": "Sparse Attention Acceleration with Synergistic In-Memory Pruning and  On-Chip Recomputation",
    "abstract": "As its core computation, a self-attention mechanism gauges pairwise\ncorrelations across the entire input sequence. Despite favorable performance,\ncalculating pairwise correlations is prohibitively costly. While recent work\nhas shown the benefits of runtime pruning of elements with low attention\nscores, the quadratic complexity of self-attention mechanisms and their on-chip\nmemory capacity demands are overlooked. This work addresses these constraints\nby architecting an accelerator, called SPRINT, which leverages the inherent\nparallelism of ReRAM crossbar arrays to compute attention scores in an\napproximate manner. Our design prunes the low attention scores using a\nlightweight analog thresholding circuitry within ReRAM, enabling SPRINT to\nfetch only a small subset of relevant data to on-chip memory. To mitigate\npotential negative repercussions for model accuracy, SPRINT re-computes the\nattention scores for the few fetched data in digital. The combined in-memory\npruning and on-chip recompute of the relevant attention scores enables SPRINT\nto transform quadratic complexity to a merely linear one. In addition, we\nidentify and leverage a dynamic spatial locality between the adjacent attention\noperations even after pruning, which eliminates costly yet redundant data\nfetches. We evaluate our proposed technique on a wide range of state-of-the-art\ntransformer models. On average, SPRINT yields 7.5x speedup and 19.6x energy\nreduction when total 16KB on-chip memory is used, while virtually on par with\niso-accuracy of the baseline models (on average 0.36% degradation).",

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have attracted increasing\nresearch interest in recent three years. Most existing HGNNs fall into two\nclasses. One class is meta-path-based HGNNs which either require domain\nknowledge to handcraft meta-paths or consume huge amount of time and memory to\nautomatically construct meta-paths. The other class does not rely on meta-path\nconstruction. It takes homogeneous convolutional graph neural networks\n(Conv-GNNs) as backbones and extend them to heterogeneous graphs by introducing\nnode-type- and edge-type-dependent parameters. Regardless of the meta-path\ndependency, most existing HGNNs employ shallow Conv-GNNs such as GCN and GAT to\naggregate neighborhood information, and may have limited capability to capture\ninformation from high-order neighborhood. In this work, we propose two\nheterogeneous graph tree network models: Heterogeneous Graph Tree Convolutional\nNetwork (HetGTCN) and Heterogeneous Graph Tree Attention Network (HetGTAN),\nwhich do not rely on meta-paths to encode heterogeneity in both node features\nand graph structure. Extensive experiments on three real-world heterogeneous\ngraph data demonstrate that the proposed HetGTCN and HetGTAN are efficient and\nconsistently outperform all state-of-the-art HGNN baselines on semi-supervised\nnode classification tasks, and can go deep without compromising performance.",

This\nmatters to determine whether ID performance can serve as a proxy for OOD\ngeneralization.\nThis short paper shows that inverse correlations between ID and OOD\nperformance do happen in real-world benchmarks.

We show an example of the\npattern on the WILDS-Camelyon17 dataset, using models from multiple training\nepochs and random seeds. Our observations are particularly striking on models\ntrained with a regularizer that diversifies the solutions to the ERM objective.\nWe nuance recommendations and conclusions made in past studies.

    "abstract": "Classic algorithms and machine learning systems like neural networks are both\nabundant in everyday life. While classic computer science algorithms are\nsuitable for precise execution of exactly defined tasks such as finding the\nshortest path in a large graph, neural networks allow learning from data to\npredict the most likely answer in more complex tasks such as image\nclassification, which cannot be reduced to an exact algorithm. To get the best\nof both worlds, this thesis explores combining both concepts leading to more\nrobust, better performing, more interpretable, more computationally efficient,\nand more data efficient architectures. The thesis formalizes the idea of\nalgorithmic supervision, which allows a neural network to learn from or in\nconjunction with an algorithm. When integrating an algorithm into a neural\narchitecture, it is important that the algorithm is differentiable such that\nthe architecture can be trained end-to-end and gradients can be propagated back\nthrough the algorithm in a meaningful way. To make algorithms differentiable,\nthis thesis proposes a general method for continuously relaxing algorithms by\nperturbing variables and approximating the expectation value in closed form,\ni.e., without sampling. In addition, this thesis proposes differentiable\nalgorithms, such as differentiable sorting networks, differentiable renderers,\nand differentiable logic gate networks.

Unfortunately, most of\nthese pre-processing methods lead to the generation a new distribution that is\nvery different from the original one, thus often leading to unrealistic data.\nAs a side effect, this new data distribution implies that existing models need\nto be re-trained to be able to make accurate predictions. To address this\nissue, we propose a novel pre-processing method, that we coin as fair mapping,\nbased on the transformation of the distribution of protected groups onto a\nchosen target one, with additional privacy constraints whose objective is to\nprevent the inference of sensitive attributes. More precisely, we leverage on\nthe recent works of the Wasserstein GAN and AttGAN frameworks to achieve the\noptimal transport of data points coupled with a discriminator enforcing the\nprotection against attribute inference. Our proposed approach, preserves the\ninterpretability of data and can be used without defining exactly the sensitive\ngroups.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of 2D pose representation during\nunsupervised 2D to 3D pose lifting to improve the accuracy, stability and\ngeneralisability of 3D human pose estimation (HPE) models. All unsupervised\n2D-3D HPE approaches provide the entire 2D kinematic skeleton to a model during\ntraining. We argue that this is sub-optimal and disruptive as long-range\ncorrelations are induced between independent 2D key points and predicted 3D\nordinates during training. To this end, we conduct the following study. With a\nmaximum architecture capacity of 6 residual blocks, we evaluate the performance\nof 5 models which each represent a 2D pose differently during the adversarial\nunsupervised 2D-3D HPE process. Additionally, we show the correlations between\n2D key points which are learned during the training process, highlighting the\nunintuitive correlations induced when an entire 2D pose is provided to a\nlifting model. Our results show that the most optimal representation of a 2D\npose is that of two independent segments, the torso and legs, with no shared\nfeatures between each lifting network. This approach decreased the average\nerror by 20\\% on the Human3.6M dataset when compared to a model with a near\nidentical parameter count trained on the entire 2D kinematic skeleton.\nFurthermore, due to the complex nature of adversarial learning, we show how\nthis representation can also improve convergence during training allowing for\nan optimum result to be obtained more often.",

To leverage powerful transformers like BERT in this\nlow-latency setting, many existing approaches perform ad-side computations\noffline. While efficient, these approaches are unable to serve cold start ads,\nresulting in poor relevance predictions for such ads. This work aims to design\na new, low-latency BERT via structured pruning to empower real-time online\ninference for cold start ads relevance on a CPU platform. Our challenge is that\nprevious methods typically prune all layers of the transformer to a high,\nuniform sparsity, thereby producing models which cannot achieve satisfactory\ninference speed with an acceptable accuracy.\nIn this paper, we propose SwiftPruner - an efficient framework that leverages\nevolution-based search to automatically find the best-performing layer-wise\nsparse BERT model under the desired latency constraint. Different from existing\nevolution algorithms that conduct random mutations, we propose a reinforced\nmutator with a latency-aware multi-objective reward to conduct better mutations\nfor efficiently searching the large space of layer-wise sparse models.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently achieves higher\nROC AUC and lower latency than the uniform sparse baseline and state-of-the-art\nsearch methods. Remarkably, under our latency requirement of 1900us on CPU,\nSwiftPruner achieves a 0.86% higher AUC than the state-of-the-art uniform\nsparse baseline for BERT-Mini on a large scale real-world dataset.

The framework captures Milner's algebra of\nregular behaviours (Milner, 1984) but fails to give an honest account of a\nclosely related calculus of probabilistic processes (Stark and Smolka, 1999).\nWe capture Stark and Smolka's calculus by giving an alternative framework,\naimed at studying a family of ordered process calculi with inequationally\nspecified branching structures and recursion operators. We observe that a\nrecent probabilistic extension of guarded Kleene algebra with tests (Rozowski,\nKozen, Kappe, Schmid, Silva, 2022) is a fragment of one of our calculi, along\nwith other examples. We also compare the intrinsic order in our process calculi\nwith the notion of similarity in coalgebra.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a unified framework for video action segmentation via\nsequence to sequence (seq2seq) translation in a fully and timestamp supervised\nsetup. In contrast to current state-of-the-art frame-level prediction methods,\nwe view action segmentation as a seq2seq translation task, i.e., mapping a\nsequence of video frames to a sequence of action segments. Our proposed method\ninvolves a series of modifications and auxiliary loss functions on the standard\nTransformer seq2seq translation model to cope with long input sequences opposed\nto short output sequences and relatively few videos. We incorporate an\nauxiliary supervision signal for the encoder via a frame-wise loss and propose\na separate alignment decoder for an implicit duration prediction. Finally, we\nextend our framework to the timestamp supervised setting via our proposed\nconstrained k-medoids algorithm to generate pseudo-segmentations. Our proposed\nframework performs consistently on both fully and timestamp supervised\nsettings, outperforming or competing state-of-the-art on several datasets.",

    "abstract": "This paper looks at semi-supervised learning (SSL) for image-based text\nrecognition. One of the most popular SSL approaches is pseudo-labeling (PL). PL\napproaches assign labels to unlabeled data before re-training the model with a\ncombination of labeled and pseudo-labeled data. However, PL methods are\nseverely degraded by noise and are prone to over-fitting to noisy labels, due\nto the inclusion of erroneous high confidence pseudo-labels generated from\npoorly calibrated models, thus, rendering threshold-based selection\nineffective. Moreover, the combinatorial complexity of the hypothesis space and\nthe error accumulation due to multiple incorrect autoregressive steps posit\npseudo-labeling challenging for sequence models. To this end, we propose a\npseudo-label generation and an uncertainty-based data selection framework for\nsemi-supervised text recognition. We first use Beam-Search inference to yield\nhighly probable hypotheses to assign pseudo-labels to the unlabelled examples.\nThen we adopt an ensemble of models, sampled by applying dropout, to obtain a\nrobust estimate of the uncertainty associated with the prediction, considering\nboth the character-level and word-level predictive distribution to select good\nquality pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on several benchmark handwriting\nand scene-text datasets show that our method outperforms the baseline\napproaches and the previous state-of-the-art semi-supervised text-recognition\nmethods.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we address the problem of generating speech from silent lip\nvideos for any speaker in the wild. In stark contrast to previous works, our\nmethod (i) is not restricted to a fixed number of speakers, (ii) does not\nexplicitly impose constraints on the domain or the vocabulary and (iii) deals\nwith videos that are recorded in the wild as opposed to within laboratory\nsettings. The task presents a host of challenges, with the key one being that\nmany features of the desired target speech, like voice, pitch and linguistic\ncontent, cannot be entirely inferred from the silent face video. In order to\nhandle these stochastic variations, we propose a new VAE-GAN architecture that\nlearns to associate the lip and speech sequences amidst the variations. With\nthe help of multiple powerful discriminators that guide the training process,\nour generator learns to synthesize speech sequences in any voice for the lip\nmovements of any person. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show that\nwe outperform all baselines by a large margin. Further, our network can be\nfine-tuned on videos of specific identities to achieve a performance comparable\nto single-speaker models that are trained on $4\\times$ more data.

    "abstract": "Modeling and control of epidemics such as the novel Corona virus have assumed\nparamount importance at a global level. A natural and powerful dynamical\nmodeling framework that has emerged in this context is a continuous time Markov\ndecision process (CTMDP) that encompasses classical compartmental paradigms\nsuch as the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model. Using a CTMDP based\nmodel poses certain technical and computational challenges. These challenges\nmotivate the need for a more efficient approach and the mean field approach\noffers an effective alternative. The mean field approach computes the\ncollective behavior of a dynamical system comprising numerous interacting nodes\n(where nodes represent individuals in the population). This paper provides a\nstate-of-the-art update on recent advances in the mean field approach to\nepidemic modeling and control. Our discussion in this paper proceeds in two\nthreads. The first thread assumes that the individual nodes faithfully follow a\nsocially optimal control policy prescribed by a regulatory authority. The\nsecond thread allows the individual nodes to exhibit independent, strategic\nbehavior. In this case, the strategic interaction is modeled as a mean field\ngame and the control is based on the associated mean field Nash equilibria. In\nthis paper, we start with a discussion of modeling of epidemics using an\nextended compartmental model - SIVR and provide an illustrative example. We\nthen provide a review of relevant literature, using a mean field approach, on\noptimal control of epidemics, dealing with how a regulatory authority may\noptimally contain epidemic spread in a population. Following this, we provide\nan update on the state-of-the-art literature on the use of the mean field game\nbased approach in the study of epidemic spread and control. We conclude the\npaper with some future research directions.",

The adhesion and surface mechanics of biofilms play crucial\nroles in generating and removing biofilm. Designing customized nano-surfaces\nwith different surface topologies can alter the adhesive properties to remove\nbiofilms more easily and greatly improve long-term biofilm control. To rapidly\ndesign such topologies, we employ individual-based modeling and Bayesian\noptimization to automate the design process and generate different active\nsurfaces for effective biofilm removal. Our framework successfully generated\nideal nano-surfaces for biofilm removal through applied shear and vibration.\nDensely distributed short pillar topography is the optimal geometry to prevent\nbiofilm formation. Under fluidic shearing, the optimal topography is to\nsparsely distribute tall, slim, pillar-like structures. When subjected to\neither vertical or lateral vibrations, thick trapezoidal cones are found to be\noptimal. Optimizing the vibrational loading indicates a small vibration\nmagnitude with relatively low frequencies is more efficient in removing\nbiofilm.

In addition to the PAP and GNs, the\nsystem consists of a set of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) mounted on\nman-made structures to increase the number of bits transmitted per Joule of\nenergy consumed measured as the global energy efficiency (GEE). The GEE\ntrajectory for the PAP is designed by considering the UAV propulsion energy\nconsumption and the Peukert effect of the PAP battery, which represents an\naccurate battery discharge profile as a non-linear function of the UAV power\nconsumption profile. The GEE trajectory design problem is solved in two phases:\nin the first, a path for the PAP and feasible positions for the IRS modules are\nfound using a multi-tier circle packing method, and the required IRS phase\nshift values are calculated using an alternate optimization method that\nconsiders the interdependence between the amplitude and phase responses of an\nIRS element; in the second phase, the PAP flying velocity and user scheduling\nare calculated using a novel multilap trajectory design algorithm. Numerical\nevaluations show that: neglecting the Peukert effect overestimates the\navailable flight time of the PAP; after a certain threshold, increasing the\nbattery size reduces the available flight time of the PAP; the presence of IRS\nmodules improves the GEE of the system compared to other baseline scenarios;\nthe multi-lap trajectory saves more energy compared to a single-lap trajectory\ndeveloped using a combination of sequential convex programming and Dinkelbach\nalgorithm.",

    "title": "Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces: A Multi-Sector Mode  Enabling Highly Directional Full-Space Wireless Coverage",
    "abstract": "Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has gained much traction due to its\npotential to manipulate the propagation environment via nearly-passive\nreconfigurable elements. In our previous work, we have analyzed and proposed a\nbeyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) model, which is not limited to traditional\ndiagonal phase shift matrices, to unify different RIS modes/architectures. In\nthis paper, we create a new branch of BD-RIS supporting a multi-sector mode. A\nmulti-sector BD-RIS is modeled as multiple antennas connected to a multi-port\ngroup-connected reconfigurable impedance network. More specifically, antennas\nare divided into $L$ ($L \\ge 2$) sectors and arranged as a polygon prism with\neach sector covering $1/L$ space. Different from the recently introduced\nconcept of intelligent omni-surface (or simultaneously transmitting and\nreflecting RIS), the multi-sector BD-RIS not only achieves a full-space\ncoverage, but also has significant performance gains thanks to the highly\ndirectional beam of each sector.We derive the constraint of the multi-sector\nBD-RIS and the corresponding channel model taking into account the relationship\nbetween antenna beamwidth and gain. With the proposed model, we first derive\nthe scaling law of the received signal power for a multi-sector BD-RIS-assisted\nsingle-user system. We then propose efficient beamforming design algorithms to\nmaximize the sum-rate of the multi-sector BD-RIS-assisted multiuser system.\nSimulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed design and\ndemonstrate the performance enhancement of the proposed multi-sector BD-RIS.",

That is, as\nthe number of input features grows, good predictive performance requires the\nnumber of summarising variables, and their associated cost, to grow rapidly. We\nintroduce a kernel that allows the number of summarising variables to grow\nexponentially with the number of input features, but requires only linear cost\nin both number of observations and input features.

We demonstrated the added-value of\nour approach through extensive experimentation with the publicly available\nFast-MRI dataset. Our physically-primed approach achieved an enhanced\ngeneralization capacity which resulted in significantly improved robustness\nagainst variations in the acquisition process and in the anatomical\ndistribution, especially in pathological regions, compared to both vanilla DNN\nmethods and DNN trained with undersampling mask augmentation.

    "abstract": "In the problem of binary quantum channel discrimination with product inputs,\nthe supremum of all type II error exponents for which the optimal type I errors\ngo to zero is equal to the Umegaki channel relative entropy, while the infimum\nof all type II error exponents for which the optimal type I errors go to one is\nequal to the infimum of the sandwiched channel R\\'enyi $\\alpha$-divergences\nover all $\\alpha>1$. Here we prove that these two threshold values coincide,\nthus proving, in particular, the strong converse property for this problem.\nOur proof method uses a minimax argument, which crucially relies on a newly\nestablished continuity property of the sandwiched R\\'enyi $\\alpha$-divergences\nfor $\\alpha\\in(1,2]$. Motivated by this, we also prove various other continuity\nproperties for quantum (channel) R\\'eny divergences, which may be of\nindependent interest.",
