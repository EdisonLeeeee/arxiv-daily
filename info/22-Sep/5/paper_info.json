    "title": "Addressing Hidden Imperfections in Online Experimentation",
    "abstract": "Technology companies are increasingly using randomized controlled trials\n(RCTs) as part of their development process. Despite having fine control over\nengineering systems and data instrumentation, these RCTs can still be\nimperfectly executed. In fact, online experimentation suffers from many of the\nsame biases seen in biomedical RCTs including opt-in and user activity bias,\nselection bias, non-compliance with the treatment, and more generally,\nchallenges in the ability to test the question of interest. The result of these\nimperfections can lead to a bias in the estimated causal effect, a loss in\nstatistical power, an attenuation of the effect, or even a need to reframe the\nquestion that can be answered. This paper aims to make practitioners of\nexperimentation more aware of imperfections in technology-industry RCTs, which\ncan be hidden throughout the engineering stack or in the design process.",

If the trust is increased, we\nconsider this a positive. However, there are two issues with this. First, we\nusually have no way of knowing whether participants should trust the model.\nTrust should surely decrease if a model is of poor quality. Second, these\nscales measure perceived trust rather than demonstrated trust. This paper\nshowcases three methods that do a good job at measuring perceived and\ndemonstrated trust.

    "title": "Towards Optimization and Model Selection for Domain Generalization: A  Mixup-guided Solution",
    "abstract": "The distribution shifts between training and test data typically undermine\nthe performance of deep learning models. In recent years, lots of work pays\nattention to domain generalization (DG) where distribution shift exists and\ntarget data are unseen. Despite the progress in algorithm design, two\nfoundational factors have long been ignored: 1) the optimization for\nregularization-based objectives (e.g., distribution alignment), and 2) the\nmodel selection for DG since no knowledge about the target domain can be\nutilized. In this paper, we propose Mixup guided optimization and selection\ntechniques for domain generalization. For optimization, we utilize an adapted\nMixup to generate an out-of-distribution dataset that can guide the preference\ndirection and optimize with Pareto optimization. For model selection, we\ngenerate a validation dataset with a closer distance to the target\ndistribution, and thereby it can better represent the target data. We also\npresent some theoretical insights behind our proposals. Comprehensive\nexperiments on one visual classification benchmark and three time-series\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our model optimization and selection techniques can\nlargely improve the performance of existing domain generalization algorithms\nand even achieve new state-of-the-art results.",

ID is the occurrence of a situation where\nthe quantity of the samples belonging to one class outnumbers that of the other\nby a wide margin, making such models learning process biased towards the\nmajority class. In recent years, to address this issue, several solutions have\nbeen put forward, which opt for either synthetically generating new data for\nthe minority class or reducing the number of majority classes for balancing the\ndata. Hence, in this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of methods based\non Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), mixed\nwith a variety of well-known imbalanced data solutions meaning oversampling and\nundersampling. To evaluate our methods, we have used KEEL, breast cancer, and\nZ-Alizadeh Sani datasets. In order to achieve reliable results, we conducted\nour experiments 100 times with randomly shuffled data distributions. The\nclassification results demonstrate that the mixed Synthetic Minority\nOversampling Technique (SMOTE)-Normalization-CNN outperforms different\nmethodologies achieving 99.08% accuracy on the 24 imbalanced datasets.\nTherefore, the proposed mixed model can be applied to imbalanced binary\nclassification problems on other real datasets.",

    "title": "Temporal Conditional VAE for Distributional Drift Adaptation in  Multivariate Time Series",
    "abstract": "Due to the nonstationary nature, the distribution of real-world multivariate\ntime series (MTS) changes over time, which is known as distribution drift. Most\nexisting MTS forecasting models greatly suffer from the distribution drift and\ndegrade the forecasting performance over time. Existing methods address\ndistribution drift via adapting to the latest arrived data or self-correcting\nper the meta knowledge derived from future data. Despite their great success in\nMTS forecasting, these methods hardly capture the intrinsic distribution\nchanges especially from a distributional perspective. Accordingly, we propose a\nnovel framework temporal conditional variational autoencoder (TCVAE) to model\nthe dynamic distributional dependencies over time between historical\nobservations and future data in MTS and infer the dependencies as a temporal\nconditional distribution to leverage latent variables. Specifically, a novel\ntemporal Hawkes attention mechanism represents temporal factors subsequently\nfed into feed-forward networks to estimate the prior Gaussian distribution of\nlatent variables. The representation of temporal factors further dynamically\nadjusts the structures of Transformer-based encoder and decoder to distribution\nchanges by leveraging a gated attention mechanism. Moreover, we introduce\nconditional continuous normalization flow to transform the prior Gaussian to a\ncomplex and form-free distribution to facilitate flexible inference of the\ntemporal conditional distribution. Extensive experiments conducted on six\nreal-world MTS datasets demonstrate the TCVAE's superior robustness and\neffectiveness over the state-of-the-art MTS forecasting baselines. We further\nillustrate the TCVAE applicability through multifaceted case studies and\nvisualization in real-world scenarios.",

This observation enables us to\nextend desirability to the nonlinear case by letting the utility scale be\nrepresented via a general closure operator. The new theory directly expresses\nrewards in actual nonlinear currency (money), much in Savage's spirit, while\narguably weakening the founding assumptions to a minimum. We characterise the\nmain properties of the new theory both from the perspective of sets of gambles\nand of their lower and upper prices (previsions).

    "abstract": "Video conferencing has become the preferred way of interacting virtually.\nCurrent video conferencing applications, like Zoom, Teams or WebEx, are\ncentralized, cloud-based platforms whose performance crucially depends on the\nproximity of clients to their data centers. Clients from low-income countries\nare particularly affected as most data centers from major cloud providers are\nlocated in economically advanced nations. Centralized conferencing applications\nalso suffer from occasional outages and are embattled by serious privacy\nviolation allegations. In recent years, decentralized video conferencing\napplications built over p2p networks and incentivized through blockchain are\nbecoming popular. A key characteristic of these networks is their openness:\nanyone can host a media server on the network and gain reward for providing\nservice. Strong economic incentives combined with lower entry barrier to join\nthe network, makes increasing server coverage to even remote regions of the\nworld. These reasons, however, also lead to a security problem: a server may\nobfuscate its true location in order to gain an unfair business advantage. In\nthis paper, we consider the problem of multicast tree construction for video\nconferencing sessions in open p2p conferencing applications. We propose DecVi,\na decentralized multicast tree construction protocol that adaptively discovers\nefficient tree structures based on an exploration-exploitation framework. DecVi\nis motivated by the combinatorial multi-armed bandit problem and uses a\nsuccinct learning model to compute effective actions. Despite operating in a\nmulti-agent setting with each server having only limited knowledge of the\nglobal network and without cooperation among servers, experimentally we show\nDecVi achieves similar quality-of-experience compared to a centralized globally\noptimal algorithm while achieving higher reliability and flexibility.",

    "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been widely applied in modeling\ndiverse image distributions. However, despite its impressive applications, the\nstructure of the latent space in GANs largely remains as a black-box, leaving\nits controllable generation an open problem, especially when spurious\ncorrelations between different semantic attributes exist in the image\ndistributions. To address this problem, previous methods typically learn linear\ndirections or individual channels that control semantic attributes in the image\nspace. However, they often suffer from imperfect disentanglement, or are unable\nto obtain multi-directional controls. In this work, in light of the above\nchallenges, we propose a novel approach that discovers nonlinear controls,\nwhich enables multi-directional manipulation as well as effective\ndisentanglement, based on gradient information in the learned GAN latent space.\nMore specifically, we first learn interpolation directions by following the\ngradients from classification networks trained separately on the attributes,\nand then navigate the latent space by exclusively controlling channels\nactivated for the target attribute in the learned directions. Empirically, with\nsmall training data, our approach is able to gain fine-grained controls over a\ndiverse set of bi-directional and multi-directional attributes, and we showcase\nits ability to achieve disentanglement significantly better than\nstate-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.",

    "abstract": "The growing penetration of variable renewable energy sources (VRES) requires\nadditional flexibility reserve to cope with the uncertainty in power system\noperation. Current industrial practice typically assumes a certain fraction of\nthe VRES production forecast power as flexibility reserve, even though the VRES\nvariability and uncertainty is a function of weather conditions. Therefore,\nthis paper focuses on weather-driven flexibility reserve sizing and allocation\nfor large-scale wind power installations. First, we propose a method, which\ngenerates statistically credible wind power forecast errors based on forecasts\nof various weather features, thus stressing a given wind power forecast. Then,\nthese errors are mapped into a risk-based reserve requirement, which is then\ncompared with the current extent-based and probability-based requirements.\nAdditionally, the risk-, extent-, and probability-based reserve requirements\nare allocated to compare their cost and deliverability performance. Throughout\nthe paper, we use real-world data to compute weather-driven flexibility reserve\nrequirements and evaluate their performance using numerical experiments on a\n1819-bus NYISO system model with both on- and off-shore wind power\ninstallations.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by cloud computing applications, we study the problem of how to\noptimally deploy new hardware subject to both power and robustness constraints.\nTo model the situation observed in large-scale data centers, we introduce the\nOnline Demand Scheduling with Failover problem. There are $m$ identical devices\nwith capacity constraints. Demands come one-by-one and, to be robust against a\ndevice failure, need to be assigned to a pair of devices. When a device fails\n(in a failover scenario), each demand assigned to it is rerouted to its paired\ndevice (which may now run at increased capacity). The goal is to assign demands\nto the devices to maximize the total utilization subject to both the normal\ncapacity constraints as well as these novel failover constraints. These latter\nconstraints introduce new decision tradeoffs not present in classic assignment\nproblems such as the Multiple Knapsack problem and AdWords.\nIn the worst-case model, we design a deterministic $\\approx\n\\frac{1}{2}$-competitive algorithm, and show this is essentially tight. To\ncircumvent this constant-factor loss, which in the context of big cloud\nproviders represents substantial capital losses, we consider the stochastic\narrival model, where all demands come i.i.d. from an unknown distribution. In\nthis model we design an algorithm that achieves a sub-linear additive regret\n(i.e. as OPT or $m$ increases, the multiplicative competitive ratio goes to\n$1$). This requires a combination of different techniques, including a\nconfiguration LP with a non-trivial post-processing step and an online monotone\nmatching procedure introduced by Rhee and Talagrand.",

For the applications mentioned\nabove, surface of the earth is usually associated with the free surface\nboundary condition. In this study, we demonstrate that the weakly imposed free\nsurface boundary condition through the simultaneous-approximation-terms\ntechnique can have issue when the source terms, which introduces abrupt\ndisturbances to the wave field, are placed too close to the surface. In\nresponse, we propose to build the free surface boundary condition into the\nsummation-by-parts finite difference operators and hence strongly and\nautomatically impose the free surface boundary condition to address this issue.\nThe procedure is very simple for acoustic wave equation, requiring resetting a\nfew rows and columns in the existing difference operators only. For the elastic\nwave equation, the procedure is more involved and requires special design of\nthe grid layout and summation-by-parts operators that satisfy additional\nrequirements, as revealed by the discrete energy analysis. In both cases, the\nenergy conserving property is preserved. Numerical examples are presented to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

    "abstract": "The constantly evolving digital transformation imposes new requirements on\nour society. Aspects relating to reliance on the networking domain and the\ndifficulty of achieving security by design pose a challenge today. As a result,\ndata-centric and machine-learning approaches arose as feasible solutions for\nsecuring large networks. Although, in the network security domain, ML-based\nsolutions face a challenge regarding the capability to generalize between\ndifferent contexts. In other words, solutions based on specific network data\nusually do not perform satisfactorily on other networks. This paper describes\nthe stacked-unsupervised federated learning (FL) approach to generalize on a\ncross-silo configuration for a flow-based network intrusion detection system\n(NIDS). The proposed approach we have examined comprises a deep autoencoder in\nconjunction with an energy flow classifier in an ensemble learning task. Our\napproach performs better than traditional local learning and naive\ncross-evaluation (training in one context and testing on another network data).\nRemarkably, the proposed approach demonstrates a sound performance in the case\nof non-iid data silos. In conjunction with an informative feature in an\nensemble architecture for unsupervised learning, we advise that the proposed\nFL-based NIDS results in a feasible approach for generalization between\nheterogeneous networks. To the best of our knowledge, our proposal is the first\nsuccessful approach to applying unsupervised FL on the problem of network\nintrusion detection generalization using flow-based data.",

However, due to the complex land\ncover patterns, the costly training sample collections, and the severe\ndistribution shifts of satellite imageries, few studies have applied\nhigh-resolution images to land cover mapping in detailed categories at large\nscale. To fill this gap, we present a large-scale land cover dataset,\nFive-Billion-Pixels. It contains more than 5 billion labeled pixels of 150\nhigh-resolution Gaofen-2 (4 m) satellite images, annotated in a 24-category\nsystem covering artificial-constructed, agricultural, and natural classes. In\naddition, we propose a deep-learning-based unsupervised domain adaptation\napproach that can transfer classification models trained on labeled dataset\n(referred to as the source domain) to unlabeled data (referred to as the target\ndomain) for large-scale land cover mapping. Specifically, we introduce an\nend-to-end Siamese network employing dynamic pseudo-label assignment and class\nbalancing strategy to perform adaptive domain joint learning. To validate the\ngeneralizability of our dataset and the proposed approach across different\nsensors and different geographical regions, we carry out land cover mapping on\nfive megacities in China and six cities in other five Asian countries severally\nusing: PlanetScope (3 m), Gaofen-1 (8 m), and Sentinel-2 (10 m) satellite\nimages.

    "abstract": "Despite recent progresses of practical asynchronous Byzantine fault tolerant\n(BFT) consensus, the state-of-the-art designs still suffer from suboptimal\nperformance. Particularly, to obtain maximum throughput, most existing\nprotocols with guaranteed linear amortized communication complexity require\neach participating node to broadcast a huge batch of transactions, which\ndramatically sacrifices latency. Worse still, the f slowest nodes' broadcasts\nmight never be agreed to output and thus can be censored (where f is the number\nof faults). Implementable mitigation to the threat either uses computationally\ncostly threshold encryption or incurs communication blow-up, thus causing\nfurther efficiency issues.\nWe present Dumbo-NG, a novel asynchronous BFT consensus (atomic broadcast) to\nsolve the remaining practical issues. Its technical core is a non-trivial\ndirect reduction from asynchronous atomic broadcast to multi-valued validated\nByzantine agreement (MVBA) with quality property. Most interestingly, the new\nprotocol structure empowers completely concurrent execution of transaction\ndissemination and asynchronous agreement. This brings about two benefits: (i)\nthe throughput-latency tension is resolved to approach peak throughput with\nminimal increase in latency; (ii) the transactions broadcasted by any honest\nnode can be agreed to output, thus conquering the censorship threat with no\nextra cost.\nWe implement Dumbo-NG and compare it to the state-of-the-art asynchronous BFT\nwith guaranteed censorship resilience including Dumbo (CCS'20) and\nSpeeding-Dumbo (NDSS'22). We also apply the techniques from Speeding-Dumbo to\nDispersedLedger (NSDI'22) and obtain an improved variant of DispersedLedger\ncalled sDumbo-DL for comprehensive comparison.

    "abstract": "In performative prediction, a predictive model impacts the distribution that\ngenerates future data, a phenomenon that is being ignored in classical\nsupervised learning. In this closed-loop setting, the natural measure of\nperformance, denoted the performative risk, captures the expected loss incurred\nby a predictive model after deployment. The core difficulty of minimizing the\nperformative risk is that the data distribution itself depends on the model\nparameters. This dependence is governed by the environment and not under the\ncontrol of the learner. As a consequence, even the choice of a convex loss\nfunction can result in a highly non-convex performative risk minimization\nproblem.

    "title": "Artifact-Tolerant Clustering-Guided Contrastive Embedding Learning for  Ophthalmic Images",
    "abstract": "Ophthalmic images and derivatives such as the retinal nerve fiber layer\n(RNFL) thickness map are crucial for detecting and monitoring ophthalmic\ndiseases (e.g., glaucoma). For computer-aided diagnosis of eye diseases, the\nkey technique is to automatically extract meaningful features from ophthalmic\nimages that can reveal the biomarkers (e.g., RNFL thinning patterns) linked to\nfunctional vision loss. However, representation learning from ophthalmic images\nthat links structural retinal damage with human vision loss is non-trivial\nmostly due to large anatomical variations between patients. The task becomes\neven more challenging in the presence of image artifacts, which are common due\nto issues with image acquisition and automated segmentation. In this paper, we\npropose an artifact-tolerant unsupervised learning framework termed EyeLearn\nfor learning representations of ophthalmic images. EyeLearn has an artifact\ncorrection module to learn representations that can best predict artifact-free\nophthalmic images. In addition, EyeLearn adopts a clustering-guided contrastive\nlearning strategy to explicitly capture the intra- and inter-image affinities.\nDuring training, images are dynamically organized in clusters to form\ncontrastive samples in which images in the same or different clusters are\nencouraged to learn similar or dissimilar representations, respectively. To\nevaluate EyeLearn, we use the learned representations for visual field\nprediction and glaucoma detection using a real-world ophthalmic image dataset\nof glaucoma patients. Extensive experiments and comparisons with\nstate-of-the-art methods verified the effectiveness of EyeLearn for learning\noptimal feature representations from ophthalmic images.",

    "abstract": "Many optimization problems suffer from noise, and nonlinearity check-based\ndecomposition methods (e.g. Differential Grouping) will completely fail to\ndetect the interactions between variables in multiplicative noisy environments,\nthus, it is difficult to decompose the large-scale optimization problems\n(LSOPs) in noisy environments. In this paper, we propose an automatic Random\nGrouping (aRG), which does not need any explicit hyperparameter specified by\nusers. Simulation experiments and mathematical analysis show that aRG can\ndetect the interactions between variables without the fitness landscape\nknowledge, and the sub-problems decomposed by aRG have smaller scales, which is\neasier for EAs to optimize. Based on the cooperative coevolution (CC)\nframework, we introduce an advanced optimizer named Modified Differential\nEvolution with Distance-based Selection (MDE-DS) to enhance the search ability\nin noisy environments. Compared with canonical DE, the parameter\nself-adaptation, the balance between diversification and intensification, and\nthe distance-based probability selection endow MDE-DS with stronger ability in\nexploration and exploitation. To evaluate the performance of our proposal, we\ndesign $500$-D and $1000$-D problems with various separability in noisy\nenvironments based on the CEC2013 LSGO Suite.

    "abstract": "As an important cyber-physical system (CPS), smart grid is highly vulnerable\nto cyber attacks. Amongst various types of attacks, false data injection attack\n(FDIA) proves to be one of the top-priority cyber-related issues and has\nreceived increasing attention in recent years. However, so far little attention\nhas been paid to privacy preservation issues in the detection of FDIAs in smart\ngrid. Inspired by federated learning, a FDIA detection method based on secure\nfederated deep learning is proposed in this paper by combining Transformer,\nfederated learning and Paillier cryptosystem. The Transformer, as a detector\ndeployed in edge nodes, delves deep into the connection between individual\nelectrical quantities by using its multi-head self-attention mechanism. By\nusing federated learning framework, our approach utilizes the data from all\nnodes to collaboratively train a detection model while preserving data privacy\nby keeping the data locally during training. To improve the security of\nfederated learning, a secure federated learning scheme is designed by combing\nPaillier cryptosystem with federated learning. Through extensive experiments on\nthe IEEE 14-bus and 118-bus test systems, the effectiveness and superiority of\nthe proposed method are verifed.",

    "abstract": "In a two-way relay channel (TWRC), physical-layer network coding (PNC)\ndoubles the system throughput by turning superimposed signals transmitted\nsimultaneously by different end nodes into useful network-coded information\n(known as PNC decoding). Prior works indicated that the PNC decoding\nperformance is affected by the relative phase offset between the received\nsignals from different nodes. In particular, some \"bad\" relative phase offsets\ncould lead to huge performance degradation. Previous solutions to mitigate the\nrelative phase offset effect were limited to the conventional bit-oriented\ncommunication paradigm, aiming at delivering a given information stream as\nquickly and reliably as possible. In contrast, this paper puts forth the first\nsemantic communication-empowered PNC-enabled TWRC to address the relative phase\noffset issue, referred to as SC-PNC. Despite the bad relative phase offsets,\nSC-PNC directly extracts the semantic meaning of transmitted messages rather\nthan ensuring accurate bit stream transmission. We jointly design deep neural\nnetwork (DNN)-based transceivers at the end nodes and propose a semantic PNC\ndecoder at the relay.

Motivated by\nthe essential interplay between point cloud denoising and normal filtering, we\nrevisit point cloud denoising from a multitask perspective, and propose an\nend-to-end network, named PCDNF, to denoise point clouds via joint normal\nfiltering. In particular, we introduce an auxiliary normal filtering task to\nhelp the overall network remove noise more effectively while preserving\ngeometric features more accurately. In addition to the overall architecture,\nour network has two novel modules. On one hand, to improve noise removal\nperformance, we design a shape-aware selector to construct the latent tangent\nspace representation of the specific point by comprehensively considering the\nlearned point and normal features and geometry priors. On the other hand, point\nfeatures are more suitable for describing geometric details, and normal\nfeatures are more conducive for representing geometric structures (e.g., sharp\nedges and corners). Combining point and normal features allows us to overcome\ntheir weaknesses. Thus, we design a feature refinement module to fuse point and\nnormal features for better recovering geometric information.

Given the abundant information and complex topology of a large-scale\ngraph, we argue that redundancy exists in such graphs and will degrade the\ntraining efficiency. Unfortunately, the model scalability severely restricts\nthe efficiency of training large-scale graphs via vanilla GNNs. Despite recent\nadvances in sampling-based training methods, sampling-based GNNs generally\noverlook the redundancy issue. It still takes intolerable time to train these\nmodels on large-scale graphs. Thereby, we propose to drop redundancy and\nimprove efficiency of training large-scale graphs with GNNs, by rethinking the\ninherent characteristics in a graph.\nIn this paper, we pioneer to propose a once-for-all method, termed DropReef,\nto drop the redundancy in large-scale graphs. Specifically, we first conduct\npreliminary experiments to explore potential redundancy in large-scale graphs.\nNext, we present a metric to quantify the neighbor heterophily of all nodes in\na graph. Based on both experimental and theoretical analysis, we reveal the\nredundancy in a large-scale graph, i.e., nodes with high neighbor heterophily\nand a great number of neighbors. Then, we propose DropReef to detect and drop\nthe redundancy in large-scale graphs once and for all, helping reduce the\ntraining time while ensuring no sacrifice in the model accuracy. To demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of DropReef, we apply it to recent state-of-the-art\nsampling-based GNNs for training large-scale graphs, owing to the high\nprecision of such models. With DropReef leveraged, the training efficiency of\nmodels can be greatly promoted. DropReef is highly compatible and is offline\nperformed, benefiting the state-of-the-art sampling-based GNNs in the present\nand future to a significant extent.",

An increasing\nnumber of research studies have demonstrated that machine learning is an\neffective and promising approach for malware detection, and some works have\neven claimed that their proposed models could achieve 99\\% detection accuracy,\nleaving little room for further improvement. However, numerous prior studies\nhave suggested that unrealistic experimental designs bring substantial biases,\nresulting in over-optimistic performance in malware detection.

    "title": "CASU: Compromise Avoidance via Secure Update for Low-end Embedded  Systems",
    "abstract": "Guaranteeing runtime integrity of embedded system software is an open\nproblem. Trade-offs between security and other priorities (e.g., cost or\nperformance) are inherent, and resolving them is both challenging and\nimportant. The proliferation of runtime attacks that introduce malicious code\n(e.g., by injection) into embedded devices has prompted a range of mitigation\ntechniques. One popular approach is Remote Attestation (RA), whereby a trusted\nentity (verifier) checks the current software state of an untrusted remote\ndevice (prover). RA yields a timely authenticated snapshot of prover state that\nverifier uses to decide whether an attack occurred.\nCurrent RA schemes require verifier to explicitly initiate RA, based on some\nunclear criteria. Thus, in case of prover's compromise, verifier only learns\nabout it late, upon the next RA instance. While sufficient for compromise\ndetection, some applications would benefit from a more proactive,\nprevention-based approach. To this end, we construct CASU: Compromise Avoidance\nvia Secure Updates. CASU is an inexpensive hardware/software co-design\nenforcing: (i) runtime software immutability, thus precluding any illegal\nsoftware modification, and (ii) authenticated updates as the sole means of\nmodifying software. In CASU, a successful RA instance serves as a proof of\nsuccessful update, and continuous subsequent software integrity is implicit,\ndue to the runtime immutability guarantee. This obviates the need for RA in\nbetween software updates and leads to unobtrusive integrity assurance with\nguarantees akin to those of prior RA techniques, with better overall\nperformance.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a fully-integrated CMOS temperature sensor for\ndensely-distributed thermal monitoring in systems on chip supporting dynamic\nvoltage and frequency scaling. The sensor front-end exploits a sub-threshold\nPMOS-based circuit to convert the local temperature into two biasing currents.\nThese are then used to define two oscillation frequencies, whose ratio is\nproportional to absolute-temperature. Finally, the sensor back-end translates\nsuch frequency ratio into the digital temperature code. Thanks to its\nlow-complexity architecture, the proposed design achieves a very compact\nfootprint along with low-power consumption and high accuracy in a wide\ntemperature range. Moreover, thanks to a simple embedded line regulation\nmechanism, our sensor supports voltage-scalability.

    "abstract": "Structural bias has recently been exploited for aspect sentiment triplet\nextraction (ASTE) and led to improved performance. On the other hand, it is\nrecognized that explicitly incorporating structural bias would have a negative\nimpact on efficiency, whereas pretrained language models (PLMs) can already\ncapture implicit structures. Thus, a natural question arises: Is structural\nbias still a necessity in the context of PLMs? To answer the question, we\npropose to address the efficiency issues by using an adapter to integrate\nstructural bias in the PLM and using a cheap-to-compute relative position\nstructure in place of the syntactic dependency structure. Benchmarking\nevaluation is conducted on the SemEval datasets. The results show that our\nproposed structural adapter is beneficial to PLMs and achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance over a range of strong baselines, yet with a light parameter demand\nand low latency. Meanwhile, we give rise to the concern that the current\nevaluation default with data of small scale is under-confident. Consequently,\nwe release a large-scale dataset for ASTE. The results on the new dataset hint\nthat the structural adapter is confidently effective and efficient to a large\nscale. Overall, we draw the conclusion that structural bias shall still be a\nnecessity even with PLMs.",

    "abstract": "A lottery is a popular form of gambling between a seller and multiple buyers,\nand its profitable design is of primary interest to the seller. Designing a\nlottery requires modeling the buyer decision-making process for uncertain\noutcomes. One of the most promising descriptive models of such decision-making\nis the cumulative prospect theory (CPT), which represents people's different\nattitudes towards gain and loss, and their overestimation of extreme events. In\nthis study, we design a lottery that maximizes the seller's profit when the\nbuyers follow CPT. The derived problem is nonconvex and constrained, and hence,\nit is challenging to directly characterize its optimal solution. We overcome\nthis difficulty by reformulating the problem as a three-level optimization\nproblem. The reformulation enables us to characterize the optimal solution.\nBased on this characterization, we propose an algorithm that computes the\noptimal lottery in linear time with respect to the number of lottery tickets.\nIn addition, we provide an efficient algorithm for a more general setting in\nwhich the ticket price is constrained.

As measurement noise is omnipresent in practice and can have detrimental\neffects, for instance, by inducing Zeno behavior in the closed-loop system and\nwith that the lack of a positive lower bound on the inter-event times,\nrendering the event-triggered control design practically useless, it is of\ngreat importance to address this gap in the literature. To do so, we present a\ngeneral framework for set stabilization of (distributed) event-triggered\ncontrol systems affected by additive measurement noise. It is shown that, under\ngeneral conditions, Zeno-free static as well as dynamic triggering rules can be\ndesigned such that the closed-loop system satisfies an input-to-state practical\nset stability property. We ensure Zeno-freeness by proving the existence of a\nuniform strictly positive lower-bound on the minimum inter-event time. The\ngeneral framework is applied to point stabilization and consensus problems as\nparticular cases, where we show that, under similar assumptions as the original\nwork, existing schemes can be redesigned to robustify them to measurement\nnoise.

An accurate and pleasant layout\nshould consider both the intra-domain relationship within layout elements and\nthe inter-domain relationship between layout elements and the image. However,\nmost previous methods simply focus on image-content-agnostic layout generation,\nwithout leveraging the complex visual information from the image. To this end,\nwe explore a novel paradigm entitled image-conditioned layout generation, which\naims to add text overlays to an image in a semantically coherent manner.\nSpecifically, we propose an Image-Conditioned Variational Transformer (ICVT)\nthat autoregressively generates various layouts in an image. First,\nself-attention mechanism is adopted to model the contextual relationship within\nlayout elements, while cross-attention mechanism is used to fuse the visual\ninformation of conditional images. Subsequently, we take them as building\nblocks of conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), which demonstrates\nappealing diversity. Second, in order to alleviate the gap between layout\nelements domain and visual domain, we design a Geometry Alignment module, in\nwhich the geometric information of the image is aligned with the layout\nrepresentation. In addition, we construct a large-scale advertisement poster\nlayout designing dataset with delicate layout and saliency map annotations.\nExperimental results show that our model can adaptively generate layouts in the\nnon-intrusive area of the image, resulting in a harmonious layout design.",

Here, we focus on a more practical setting in object rearrangement,\ni.e., rearranging objects from shuffled layouts to a normative target\ndistribution without explicit goal specification. However, it remains\nchallenging for AI agents, as it is hard to describe the target distribution\n(goal specification) for reward engineering or collect expert trajectories as\ndemonstrations. Hence, it is infeasible to directly employ reinforcement\nlearning or imitation learning algorithms to address the task. This paper aims\nto search for a policy only with a set of examples from a target distribution\ninstead of a handcrafted reward function. We employ the score-matching\nobjective to train a Target Gradient Field (TarGF), indicating a direction on\neach object to increase the likelihood of the target distribution. For object\nrearrangement, the TarGF can be used in two ways: 1) For model-based planning,\nwe can cast the target gradient into a reference control and output actions\nwith a distributed path planner; 2) For model-free reinforcement learning, the\nTarGF is not only used for estimating the likelihood-change as a reward but\nalso provides suggested actions in residual policy learning.

    "title": "Treasure Hunt in Graph using Pebbles",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the treasure hunt problem in a graph by a mobile\nagent. The nodes in the graph $G=(V,E)$ are anonymous and the edges incident to\na vertex $v\\in V$ whose degree is $deg(v)$ are labeled arbitrarily as\n$0,1,\\ldots, deg(v)-1$. At a node $t$ in $G$ a stationary object, called {\\it\ntreasure} is located. The mobile agent that is initially located at a node $s$\nin $G$, the starting point of the agent, must find the treasure by reaching the\nnode $t$. The distance from $s$ to $t$ is $D$. The {\\it time} required to find\nthe treasure is the total number of edges the agent visits before it finds the\ntreasure. The agent does not have any prior knowledge about the graph or the\nposition of the treasure. An oracle, that knows the graph, the initial position\nof the agent, and the position of the treasure, places some pebbles on the\nnodes, at most one per node, of the graph to guide the agent towards the\ntreasure.\nThis paper aims to study the trade-off between the number of pebbles provided\nand the time required to find the treasure. To be specific, we aim to answer\nthe following question. ``What is the minimum time for treasure hunt in a graph\nwith maximum degree $\\Delta$ and diameter $D$ if $k$ pebbles are placed? \"\nWe answer the above question when $k<D$ or $k=cD$ for some positive integer\n$c$. We design efficient algorithms for the agent for different values of $k$.\nWe also propose an almost matching lower bound result for $k<D$.",

    "title": "A Discussion of Discrimination and Fairness in Insurance Pricing",
    "abstract": "Indirect discrimination is an issue of major concern in algorithmic models.\nThis is particularly the case in insurance pricing where protected policyholder\ncharacteristics are not allowed to be used for insurance pricing. Simply\ndisregarding protected policyholder information is not an appropriate solution\nbecause this still allows for the possibility of inferring the protected\ncharacteristics from the non-protected ones. This leads to so-called proxy or\nindirect discrimination. Though proxy discrimination is qualitatively different\nfrom the group fairness concepts in machine learning, these group fairness\nconcepts are proposed to 'smooth out' the impact of protected characteristics\nin the calculation of insurance prices. The purpose of this note is to share\nsome thoughts about group fairness concepts in the light of insurance pricing\nand to discuss their implications. We present a statistical model that is free\nof proxy discrimination, thus, unproblematic from an insurance pricing point of\nview. However, we find that the canonical price in this statistical model does\nnot satisfy any of the three most popular group fairness axioms. This seems\npuzzling and we welcome feedback on our example and on the usefulness of these\ngroup fairness axioms for non-discriminatory insurance pricing.",

    "abstract": "Recent works have shown huge success of deep learning models for common in\nvocabulary (IV) scene text recognition. However, in real-world scenarios,\nout-of-vocabulary (OOV) words are of great importance and SOTA recognition\nmodels usually perform poorly on OOV settings. Inspired by the intuition that\nthe learned language prior have limited OOV preformence, we design a framework\nnamed Vision Language Adaptive Mutual Decoder (VLAMD) to tackle OOV problems\npartly. VLAMD consists of three main conponents. Firstly, we build an attention\nbased LSTM decoder with two adaptively merged visual-only modules, yields a\nvision-language balanced main branch. Secondly, we add an auxiliary query based\nautoregressive transformer decoding head for common visual and language prior\nrepresentation learning. Finally, we couple these two designs with\nbidirectional training for more diverse language modeling, and do mutual\nsequential decoding to get robuster results. Our approach achieved 70.31\\% and\n59.61\\% word accuracy on IV+OOV and OOV settings respectively on Cropped Word\nRecognition Task of OOV-ST Challenge at ECCV 2022 TiE Workshop, where we got\n1st place on both settings.",

    "title": "Real-time 3D Single Object Tracking with Transformer",
    "abstract": "LiDAR-based 3D single object tracking is a challenging issue in robotics and\nautonomous driving. Currently, existing approaches usually suffer from the\nproblem that objects at long distance often have very sparse or\npartially-occluded point clouds, which makes the features extracted by the\nmodel ambiguous. Ambiguous features will make it hard to locate the target\nobject and finally lead to bad tracking results. To solve this problem, we\nutilize the powerful Transformer architecture and propose a\nPoint-Track-Transformer (PTT) module for point cloud-based 3D single object\ntracking task. Specifically, PTT module generates fine-tuned attention features\nby computing attention weights, which guides the tracker focusing on the\nimportant features of the target and improves the tracking ability in complex\nscenarios. To evaluate our PTT module, we embed PTT into the dominant method\nand construct a novel 3D SOT tracker named PTT-Net. In PTT-Net, we embed PTT\ninto the voting stage and proposal generation stage, respectively. PTT module\nin the voting stage could model the interactions among point patches, which\nlearns context-dependent features. Meanwhile, PTT module in the proposal\ngeneration stage could capture the contextual information between object and\nbackground. We evaluate our PTT-Net on KITTI and NuScenes datasets.\nExperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PTT module and the\nsuperiority of PTT-Net, which surpasses the baseline by a noticeable margin,\n~10% in the Car category. Meanwhile, our method also has a significant\nperformance improvement in sparse scenarios. In general, the combination of\ntransformer and tracking pipeline enables our PTT-Net to achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance on both two datasets. Additionally, PTT-Net could\nrun in real-time at 40FPS on NVIDIA 1080Ti GPU. Our code is open-sourced for\nthe research community at https://github.com/shanjiayao/PTT.",

    "abstract": "Bayesian optimization is a popular formalism for global optimization, but its\ncomputational costs limit it to expensive-to-evaluate functions. A competing,\ncomputationally more efficient, global optimization framework is optimistic\noptimization, which exploits prior knowledge about the geometry of the search\nspace in form of a dissimilarity function. We investigate to which degree the\nconceptual advantages of Bayesian Optimization can be combined with the\ncomputational efficiency of optimistic optimization. By mapping the kernel to a\ndissimilarity, we obtain an optimistic optimization algorithm for the Bayesian\nOptimization setting with a run-time of up to $\\mathcal{O}(N \\log N)$. As a\nhigh-level take-away we find that, when using stationary kernels on objectives\nof relatively low evaluation cost, optimistic optimization can be strongly\npreferable over Bayesian optimization, while for strongly coupled and\nparametric models, good implementations of Bayesian optimization can perform\nmuch better, even at low evaluation cost. We argue that there is a new research\ndomain between geometric and probabilistic search, i.e. methods that run\ndrastically faster than traditional Bayesian optimization, while retaining some\nof the crucial functionality of Bayesian optimization.",

In full-diversity scenarios where the coherence time is at\nleast T>= (K+1)M, the proposed constellation design criterion is based on the\nasymptotic expression of the multiuser pairwise error probability (PEP) derived\nby Brehler and Varanasi. In non-full diversity scenarios, for which the\nprevious PEP expression is no longer valid, the proposed design criteria are\nbased on proxies of the PEP recently proposed by Ngo and Yang. Although both\nthe PEP expression and its bounds or proxies were previously considered\nintractable for optimization, in this work we derive their respective\nunconstrained gradients. These gradients are in turn used in the optimization\nof the proposed cost functions in different Riemannian manifolds representing\ndifferent power constraints. In particular, in addition to the standard unitary\nspace-time modulation (USTM) leading to optimization on the Grassmann manifold,\nwe consider a more relaxed per-codeword power constraint leading to\noptimization on the so-called oblique manifold, and an average power constraint\nleading to optimization on the so-called trace manifold.

For this the typical approach is to\nregularize the learned representation through prior probability distributions.\nHowever such priors are usually unavailable or ad hoc. To deal with this, we\npropose a dynamics-constrained representation learning framework. Instead of\nusing predefined probabilities, we restrict the latent representation to follow\nspecific dynamics, which is a more natural constraint for representation\nlearning in dynamical systems.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we analyze the approximation quality of a greedy heuristic for\nautomatic map labeling. As input, we have a set of events, each associated with\na label at a fixed position, a timestamp, and a weight. Let a time-window\nlabeling be a selection of these labels such that all corresponding timestamps\nlie in a queried time window and no two labels overlap. A solution to the\ntime-window labeling problem consists of a data structure that encodes a\ntime-window labeling for each possible time window; when a user specifies a\ntime window of interest using a slider interface, we query the data structure\nfor the corresponding labeling.\nWe define the quality of a time-window labeling solution as the sum of the\nweights of the labels in each time-window labeling, integrated over all time\nwindows. We aim at maximizing the quality under the condition that a label may\nnever disappear when the user shrinks the time window. In this paper, we\nanalyze how well a greedy heuristic approximates the maximum quality that can\nbe realized under this condition.\nOn the one hand, we present an instance with square labels of equal size and\nequal weight for which the greedy heuristic fails to find a solution of at\nleast 1/4 of the quality of an optimal solution. On the other hand, we prove\nthat the greedy heuristic does guarantee a solution with at least 1/8 of the\nquality of an optimal solution. In the case of disk-shaped labels of equal size\nand equal weight, the greedy heuristic gives a solution with at least 1/10 of\nthe quality of an optimal solution. If the labels are squares or disks of equal\nsize and the maximum weight divided by the minimum weight is at most b, then\nthe greedy heuristic has approximation ratio Theta(log b).",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used for graph representation\nlearning. Despite its prevalence, GNN suffers from two drawbacks in the graph\nclassification task, the neglect of graph-level relationships, and the\ngeneralization issue. Each graph is treated separately in GNN message\npassing/graph pooling, and existing methods to address overfitting operate on\neach individual graph. This makes the graph representations learnt less\neffective in the downstream classification. In this paper, we propose a\nClass-Aware Representation rEfinement (CARE) framework for the task of graph\nclassification. CARE computes simple yet powerful class representations and\ninjects them to steer the learning of graph representations towards better\nclass separability. CARE is a plug-and-play framework that is highly flexible\nand able to incorporate arbitrary GNN backbones without significantly\nincreasing the computational cost. We also theoretically prove that CARE has a\nbetter generalization upper bound than its GNN backbone through\nVapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension analysis. Our extensive experiments with 10\nwell-known GNN backbones on 9 benchmark datasets validate the superiority and\neffectiveness of CARE over its GNN counterparts.",

In\nthis work, we propose a more principled way of creating a graph from a 3D\npointcloud. Our method is based on performing k-NN over a transformation of the\ninput 3D pointcloud. This transformation is done by an Multi-Later Perceptron\n(MLP) with learnable parameters that is optimized through backpropagation\njointly with the rest of the network. We also introduce a regularization method\nbased on stress minimization, which allows to control how distant is the learnt\ngraph from our baseline: k-NN over xyz space. This framework is tested on\nModelNet40, where graphs generated by our network outperformed the baseline by\n0.3 points in overall accuracy.",

Specifically, we\napply a graph neural network (GNN) to obtain the embeddings of the clauses in\nthe conjunctive normal format (CNF). A hierarchical Transformer architecture is\napplied on the clause embeddings to capture the relationships among clauses,\nand the self-attention weight is learned to be high when those clauses forming\nUNSAT cores are attended together, and set to be low otherwise. By doing so,\nSATformer effectively learns the correlations among clauses for SAT prediction.\nExperimental results show that SATformer is more powerful than existing\nend-to-end learning-based SAT solvers.",

    "abstract": "This paper considers the simultaneous position and orientation planning of\nnonholonomic multirobot systems. Different from common researches which only\nfocus on final position constraints, we model the nonholonomic mobile robot as\na rigid body and introduce the orientation as well as position constraints for\nthe robot's final states. In other words, robots should not only reach the\nspecified positions, but also point to the desired orientations simultaneously.\nThe challenge of this problem lies in the underactuation of full-state motion\nplanning, since three states need to be planned by mere two control inputs. To\nthis end, we propose a dynamic vector field (DVF) based on the rigid body\nmodeling. Specifically, the dynamics of the robot orientation are brought into\nthe vector field, implying that the vector field is not static on the 2-D plane\nanymore, but a dynamic one varying with the attitude angle. Hence, each robot\ncan move along the integral curve of the DVF to arrive at the desired position,\nand in the meantime, the attitude angle can converge to the specified value\nfollowing the orientation dynamics. Subsequently, by designing a circular\nvector field under the framework of the DVF, we further study the obstacle\navoidance and mutual-robot-collision avoidance in the motion planning. Finally,\nnumerical simulation examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the\nproposed methodology.",

While tremendous successful methods have obtained excellent results,\nmost of them are computationally expensive and not applicable for real-time\non-device inference. In this paper, we aim to address more practical\napplications of monocular depth estimation, where the solution should consider\nnot only the precision but also the inference time on mobile devices. To this\nend, we first develop an end-to-end learning-based model with a tiny weight\nsize (1.4MB) and a short inference time (27FPS on Raspberry Pi 4). Then, we\npropose a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy, called R2 crop, to\nboost the model performance. Moreover, we observe that the simple lightweight\nmodel trained with only one single loss term will suffer from performance\nbottleneck. To alleviate this issue, we adopt multiple loss terms to provide\nsufficient constraints during the training stage. Furthermore, with a simple\ndynamic re-weight strategy, we can avoid the time-consuming hyper-parameter\nchoice of loss terms. Finally, we adopt the structure-aware distillation to\nfurther improve the model performance.

    "abstract": "Gradualizing the Calculus of Inductive Constructions (CIC) involves dealing\nwith subtle tensions between normalization, graduality, and conservativity with\nrespect to CIC. Recently, GCIC has been proposed as a parametrized gradual type\ntheory that admits three variants, each sacrificing one of these properties.\nFor devising a gradual proof assistant based on CIC, normalization and\nconservativity with respect to CIC are key, but the tension with graduality\nneeds to be addressed. Additionally, several challenges remain: (1) The\npresence of two wildcard terms at any type-the error and unknown terms-enables\ntrivial proofs of any theorem, jeopardizing the use of a gradual type theory in\na proof assistant; (2) Supporting general indexed inductive families, most\nprominently equality, is an open problem; (3) Theoretical accounts of gradual\ntyping and graduality so far do not support handling type mismatches detected\nduring reduction; (4) Precision and graduality are external notions not\namenable to reasoning within a gradual type theory. All these issues manifest\nprimally in CastCIC, the cast calculus used to define GCIC. In this work, we\npresent an extension of CastCIC called GRIP. GRIP is a reasonably gradual type\ntheory that addresses the issues above, featuring internal precision and\ngeneral exception handling. GRIP features an impure (gradual) sort of types\ninhabited by errors and unknown terms, and a pure (non-gradual) sort of strict\npropositions for consistent reasoning about gradual terms. Internal precision\nsupports reasoning about graduality within GRIP itself, for instance to\ncharacterize gradual exception-handling terms, and supports gradual subset\ntypes.

Deep\nlearning has been explored in image smoothing to deal with the complex\nentanglement of semantic structures and trivial details. However, current\nmethods neglect two important facts in smoothing: 1) naive pixel-level\nregression supervised by the limited number of high-quality smoothing\nground-truth could lead to domain shift and cause generalization problems\ntowards real-world images; 2) texture appearance is closely related to object\nsemantics, so that image smoothing requires awareness of semantic difference to\napply adaptive smoothing strengths.

    "abstract": "Motivation: The development of novel compounds targeting proteins of interest\nis one of the most important tasks in the pharmaceutical industry. Deep\ngenerative models have been applied to targeted molecular design and have shown\npromising results. Recently, target-specific molecule generation has been\nviewed as a translation between the protein language and the chemical language.\nHowever, such a model is limited by the availability of interacting\nprotein-ligand pairs. On the other hand, large amounts of unlabeled protein\nsequences and chemical compounds are available and have been used to train\nlanguage models that learn useful representations. In this study, we propose\nexploiting pretrained biochemical language models to initialize (i.e. warm\nstart) targeted molecule generation models. We investigate two warm start\nstrategies: (i) a one-stage strategy where the initialized model is trained on\ntargeted molecule generation (ii) a two-stage strategy containing a\npre-finetuning on molecular generation followed by target specific training. We\nalso compare two decoding strategies to generate compounds: beam search and\nsampling.\nResults: The results show that the warm-started models perform better than a\nbaseline model trained from scratch. The two proposed warm-start strategies\nachieve similar results to each other with respect to widely used metrics from\nbenchmarks. However, docking evaluation of the generated compounds for a number\nof novel proteins suggests that the one-stage strategy generalizes better than\nthe two-stage strategy. Additionally, we observe that beam search outperforms\nsampling in both docking evaluation and benchmark metrics for assessing\ncompound quality.\nAvailability and implementation: The source code is available at\nhttps://github.com/boun-tabi/biochemical-lms-for-drug-design and the materials\nare archived in Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6832145",

More\nspecifically, in the present study, we report the effects of idle motion\nfrequency in a robot on emotional contagion in a face-to-face interactive task\nwith a human participant.\nThe robotic system Buddy was programmed to adopt a sad posture and facial\nexpression while telling three sad stories and moving its head up/down at low,\nmedium, and high frequency. Each participant (N=15 total) was invited to sit in\nfront of Buddy and listen to the stories. Unconscious changes in posture in the\nhuman participant were recorded using a 3D motion capture system (Qualysis).\nResults show greater inclinations of the shoulder/torso towards the ground in\nlow-frequency trials and more rigid postures in high-frequency trials. The\nquantity of spontaneous movement was also greater when Buddy moved at slow\nfrequencies. These findings echo results reported in experimental psychology\nwhen two individuals are engaged in social interactions. The scores obtained in\nthe Godspeed questionnaire further suggest that emotional contagion may occur\nwhen Buddy moves slowly because the robotic system is perceived as more natural\nand knowledgeable, e.g., at speed coherent with the expressed emotion. Our work\nexplores the importance of body posture and frequency of idle motion in the\nconception of robotic systems.

    "abstract": "Our world is being increasingly pervaded by intelligent robots with varying\ndegrees of autonomy. To seamlessly integrate themselves in our society, these\nmachines should possess the ability to navigate the complexities of our daily\nroutines even in the absence of a human's direct input. In other words, we want\nthese robots to understand the intentions of their partners with the purpose of\npredicting the best way to help them. In this paper, we present CASPER\n(Cognitive Architecture for Social Perception and Engagement in Robots): a\nsymbolic cognitive architecture that uses qualitative spatial reasoning to\nanticipate the pursued goal of another agent and to calculate the best\ncollaborative behavior. This is performed through an ensemble of parallel\nprocesses that model a low-level action recognition and a high-level goal\nunderstanding, both of which are formally verified. We have tested this\narchitecture in a simulated kitchen environment and the results we have\ncollected show that the robot is able to both recognize an ongoing goal and to\nproperly collaborate towards its achievement. This demonstrates a new use of\nQualitative Spatial Relations applied to the problem of intention reading in\nthe domain of human-robot interaction.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we ask for and answer what makes classical reinforcement\nlearning cooperative. Cooperating in social dilemma situations is vital for\nanimals, humans, and machines. While evolutionary theory revealed a range of\nmechanisms promoting cooperation, the conditions under which agents learn to\ncooperate are contested. Here, we demonstrate which and how individual elements\nof the multi-agent learning setting lead to cooperation. Specifically, we\nconsider the widely used temporal-difference reinforcement learning algorithm\nwith epsilon-greedy exploration in the classic environment of an iterated\nPrisoner's dilemma with one-period memory. Each of the two learning agents\nlearns a strategy that conditions the following action choices on both agents'\naction choices of the last round. We find that next to a high caring for future\nrewards, a low exploration rate, and a small learning rate, it is primarily\nintrinsic stochastic fluctuations of the reinforcement learning process which\ndouble the final rate of cooperation to up to 80\\%. Thus, inherent noise is not\na necessary evil of the iterative learning process. It is a critical asset for\nthe learning of cooperation. However, we also point out the trade-off between a\nhigh likelihood of cooperative behavior and achieving this in a reasonable\namount of time. Our findings are relevant for purposefully designing\ncooperative algorithms and regulating undesired collusive effects.",

To address this gap, I draw on\nand extend a large scale dataset of the locations of highly active software\ndevelopers collected in February 2021, one year before the invasion. Revisiting\nthose developers that had been located in Russia in 2021, I confirm a\nsignificant exodus of developers from Russia by late June 2022. 8.6% of Russian\ndevelopers list a new country, compared with 2.4% of developers from comparable\ncountries in the region but not directly involved in the conflict. 11.3% of\nRussian developers have obscured their location (vs. 1.9% in the comparison\nset).

However, CT relies on agents learning from one-off\nobservations of other agents' actions at a given state. Because MARL agents\nexplore and update their policies during training, these observations often\nprovide poor predictions about other agents' behaviour and the expected return\nfor a given action. CT methods therefore suffer from high variance and\nerror-prone estimates, harming learning. CT methods also suffer from explosive\ngrowth in complexity due to the reliance on global observations, unless strong\nfactorisation restrictions are imposed (e.g., monotonic reward functions for\nQMIX). We address these challenges with a new semi-centralised MARL framework\nthat performs policy-embedded training and decentralised execution. Our method,\npolicy embedded reinforcement learning algorithm (PERLA), is an enhancement\ntool for Actor-Critic MARL algorithms that leverages a novel parameter sharing\nprotocol and policy embedding method to maintain estimates that account for\nother agents' behaviour.

A key\nresearch problem is to accurately and quickly recognize in-place gestures,\nsince they can trigger specific movements of virtual viewpoints and enhance\nuser experience. However, to achieve real-time experience, only short-term\nsensor sequence data (up to about 300ms, 6 to 10 frames) can be taken as input,\nwhich actually affects the classification performance due to limited\nspatio-temporal information. In this paper, we propose a novel long-term memory\naugmented network for in-place gestures classification. It takes as input both\nshort-term gesture sequence samples and their corresponding long-term sequence\nsamples that provide extra relevant spatio-temporal information in the training\nphase. We store long-term sequence features with an external memory queue. In\naddition, we design a memory augmented loss to help cluster features of the\nsame class and push apart features from different classes, thus enabling our\nmemory queue to memorize more relevant long-term sequence features. In the\ninference phase, we input only short-term sequence samples to recall the stored\nfeatures accordingly, and fuse them together to predict the gesture class. We\ncreate a large-scale in-place gestures dataset from 25 participants with 11\ngestures. Our method achieves a promising accuracy of 95.1% with a latency of\n192ms, and an accuracy of 97.3% with a latency of 312ms, and is demonstrated to\nbe superior to recent in-place gesture classification techniques.

As a result, with point clouds sampled from multiple viewpoints,\nfiducial marker detection remains an unsolved problem. In this letter, we\ndevelop a novel algorithm to detect the fiducial markers in the multi-viewpoint\npoint cloud. The proposed algorithm includes two stages. First, Regions of\nInterest (ROIs) detection finds point clusters that could contain fiducial\nmarkers. Specifically, a method extracting the ROIs from the intensity\nperspective is introduced on account of the fact that from the spatial\nperspective, the markers, which are sheets of paper or thin boards, are\nnon-distinguishable from the planes to which they are attached. Second, marker\ndetection verifies if the candidate ROIs contain fiducial markers and outputs\nthe ID numbers and vertices locations of the markers in the valid ROIs. In\nparticular, the ROIs are transmitted to a predefined intermediate plane for the\npurpose of adopting a spherical projection to generate the intensity image, and\nthen, marker detection is completed through the intensity image.

    "abstract": "Economic Load Dispatch depicts a fundamental role in the operation of power\nsystems, as it decreases the environmental load, minimizes the operating cost,\nand preserves energy resources. The optimal solution to Economic Load Dispatch\nproblems and various constraints can be obtained by evolving several\nevolutionary and swarm-based algorithms. The major drawback to swarm-based\nalgorithms is premature convergence towards an optimal solution. Fitness\nDependent Optimizer is a novel optimization algorithm stimulated by the\ndecision-making and reproductive process of bee swarming. Fitness Dependent\nOptimizer (FDO) examines the search spaces based on the searching approach of\nParticle Swarm Optimization. To calculate the pace, the fitness function is\nutilized to generate weights that direct the search agents in the phases of\nexploitation and exploration. In this research, the authors have carried out\nFitness Dependent Optimizer to solve the Economic Load Dispatch problem by\nreducing fuel cost, emission allocation, and transmission loss. Moreover, the\nauthors have enhanced a novel variant of Fitness Dependent Optimizer, which\nincorporates novel population initialization techniques and dynamically\nemployed sine maps to select the weight factor for Fitness Dependent Optimizer.\nThe enhanced population initialization approach incorporates a quasi-random\nSabol sequence to generate the initial solution in the multi-dimensional search\nspace. A standard 24-unit system is employed for experimental evaluation with\ndifferent power demands. Empirical results obtained using the enhanced variant\nof the Fitness Dependent Optimizer demonstrate superior performance in terms of\nlow transmission loss, low fuel cost, and low emission allocation compared to\nthe conventional Fitness Dependent Optimizer.

    "abstract": "On the Internet, sub-millisecond queueing delay and capacity-seeking have\ntraditionally been considered mutually exclusive. We introduce a service that\noffers both: Low Latency Low Loss Scalable throughput (L4S). When tested under\na wide range of conditions emulated on a testbed using real residential\nbroadband equipment, queue delay remained both low (median 100--300 $\\mu$s) and\nconsistent (99th percentile below 2 ms even under highly dynamic workloads),\nwithout compromising other metrics (zero congestion loss and close to full\nutilization). L4S exploits the properties of `Scalable' congestion controls\n(e.g., DCTCP, TCP Prague). Flows using such congestion control are however very\naggressive, which causes a deployment challenge as L4S has to coexist with\nso-called `Classic' flows (e.g., Reno, CUBIC). This paper introduces an\narchitectural solution: `Dual Queue Coupled Active Queue Management', which\nenables balance between Scalable and Classic flows. It counterbalances the more\naggressive response of Scalable flows with more aggressive marking, without\nhaving to inspect flow identifiers. The Dual Queue structure has been\nimplemented as a Linux queuing discipline. It acts like a semi-permeable\nmembrane, isolating the latency of Scalable and `Classic' traffic, but coupling\ntheir capacity into a single bandwidth pool. This paper justifies the design\nand implementation choices, and visualizes a representative selection of\nhundreds of thousands of experiment runs to test our claims.",

New advances in\nevent-based tactile sensors and Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) spur the\nresearch in event-driven tactile learning. However, SNN-enabled event-driven\ntactile learning is still in its infancy due to the limited representative\nabilities of existing spiking neurons and high spatio-temporal complexity in\nthe data. In this paper, to improve the representative capabilities of existing\nspiking neurons, we propose a novel neuron model called \"location spiking\nneuron\", which enables us to extract features of event-based data in a novel\nway. Moreover, based on the classical Time Spike Response Model (TSRM), we\ndevelop a specific location spiking neuron model - Location Spike Response\nModel (LSRM) that serves as a new building block of SNNs. Furthermore, we\npropose a hybrid model which combines an SNN with TSRM neurons and an SNN with\nLSRM neurons to capture the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in the data.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the significant improvements of our models\nover other works on event-driven tactile learning and show the superior energy\nefficiency of our models and location spiking neurons, which may unlock their\npotential on neuromorphic hardware.",

ML for model building automation\ncan be seen as a way of introducing another level of abstraction to focus\nexpert humans in the most cognitive tasks of bioprocess development. First,\nprobabilistic programming is used for the autonomous building of predictive\nmodels. Second, machine learning automatically assesses alternative decisions\nby planning experiments to test hypotheses and conducting investigations to\ngather informative data that focus on model selection based on the uncertainty\nof model predictions. This review provides a comprehensive overview of ML-based\nautomation in bioprocess development. On the one hand, the biotech and\nbioengineering community should be aware of the potential and, most\nimportantly, the limitation of existing ML solutions for their application in\nbiotechnology and biopharma. On the other hand, it is essential to identify the\nmissing links to enable the easy implementation of ML and Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) solutions in valuable solutions for the bio-community. We\nsummarize recent ML implementation across several important subfields of\nbioprocess systems and raise two crucial challenges remaining the bottleneck of\nbioprocess automation and reducing uncertainty in biotechnology development.\nThere is no one-fits-all procedure; however, this review should help identify\nthe potential automation combining biotechnology and ML domains.",

    "abstract": "Temporal networks have been widely used to model real-world complex systems\nsuch as financial systems and e-commerce systems. In a temporal network, the\njoint neighborhood of a set of nodes often provides crucial structural\ninformation on predicting whether they may interact at a certain time. However,\nrecent representation learning methods for temporal networks often fail to\nextract such information or depend on extremely time-consuming feature\nconstruction approaches. To address the issue, this work proposes\nNeighborhood-Aware Temporal network model (NAT). For each node in the network,\nNAT abandons the commonly-used one-single-vector-based representation while\nadopting a novel dictionary-type neighborhood representation. Such a dictionary\nrepresentation records a down-sampled set of the neighboring nodes as keys, and\nallows fast construction of structural features for a joint neighborhood of\nmultiple nodes. We also design dedicated data structure termed N-cache to\nsupport parallel access and update of those dictionary representations on GPUs.\nNAT gets evaluated over seven real-world large-scale temporal networks. NAT not\nonly outperforms all cutting-edge baselines by averaged 5.9% and 6.0% in\ntransductive and inductive link prediction accuracy, respectively, but also\nkeeps scalable by achieving a speed-up of 4.1-76.7 against the baselines that\nadopts joint structural features and achieves a speed-up of 1.6-4.0 against the\nbaselines that cannot adopt those features.

    "abstract": "In the context of modern environmental and societal concerns, there is an\nincreasing demand for methods able to identify management strategies for civil\nengineering systems, minimizing structural failure risks while optimally\nplanning inspection and maintenance (I&M) processes. Most available methods\nsimplify the I&M decision problem to the component level due to the\ncomputational complexity associated with global optimization methodologies\nunder joint system-level state descriptions. In this paper, we propose an\nefficient algorithmic framework for inference and decision-making under\nuncertainty for engineering systems exposed to deteriorating environments,\nproviding optimal management strategies directly at the system level. In our\napproach, the decision problem is formulated as a factored partially observable\nMarkov decision process, whose dynamics are encoded in Bayesian network\nconditional structures. The methodology can handle environments under equal or\ngeneral, unequal deterioration correlations among components, through Gaussian\nhierarchical structures and dynamic Bayesian networks. In terms of policy\noptimization, we adopt a deep decentralized multi-agent actor-critic (DDMAC)\nreinforcement learning approach, in which the policies are approximated by\nactor neural networks guided by a critic network. By including deterioration\ndependence in the simulated environment, and by formulating the cost model at\nthe system level, DDMAC policies intrinsically consider the underlying\nsystem-effects. This is demonstrated through numerical experiments conducted\nfor both a 9-out-of-10 system and a steel frame under fatigue deterioration.\nResults demonstrate that DDMAC policies offer substantial benefits when\ncompared to state-of-the-art heuristic approaches. The inherent consideration\nof system-effects by DDMAC strategies is also interpreted based on the learned\npolicies.",

    "abstract": "An elastic-degenerate string is a sequence of $n$ finite sets of strings of\ntotal length $N$, introduced to represent a set of related DNA sequences, also\nknown as a pangenome. The ED string matching (EDSM) problem consists in\nreporting all occurrences of a pattern of length $m$ in an ED text. This\nproblem has recently received some attention by the combinatorial pattern\nmatching community, culminating in an\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(nm^{\\omega-1})+\\mathcal{O}(N)$-time algorithm [Bernardini\net al., SIAM J. Comput. 2022], where $\\omega$ denotes the matrix multiplication\nexponent and the $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\cdot)$ notation suppresses polylog\nfactors. In the $k$-EDSM problem, the approximate version of EDSM, we are asked\nto report all pattern occurrences with at most $k$ errors. $k$-EDSM can be\nsolved in $\\mathcal{O}(k^2mG+kN)$ time, under edit distance, or\n$\\mathcal{O}(kmG+kN)$ time, under Hamming distance, where $G$ denotes the total\nnumber of strings in the ED text [Bernardini et al., Theor. Comput. Sci. 2020].\nUnfortunately, $G$ is only bounded by $N$, and so even for $k=1$, the existing\nalgorithms run in $\\Omega(mN)$ time in the worst case. In this paper we show\nthat $1$-EDSM can be solved in $\\mathcal{O}((nm^2 + N)\\log m)$ or\n$\\mathcal{O}(nm^3 + N)$ time under edit distance. For the decision version, we\npresent a faster $\\mathcal{O}(nm^2\\sqrt{\\log m} + N\\log\\log m)$-time algorithm.\nWe also show that $1$-EDSM can be solved in $\\mathcal{O}(nm^2 + N\\log m)$ time\nunder Hamming distance. Our algorithms for edit distance rely on non-trivial\nreductions from $1$-EDSM to special instances of classic computational geometry\nproblems (2d rectangle stabbing or 2d range emptiness), which we show how to\nsolve efficiently. In order to obtain an even faster algorithm for Hamming\ndistance, we rely on employing and adapting the $k$-errata trees for indexing\nwith errors [Cole et al., STOC 2004].",

However, ML models are vulnerable to privacy\nattacks that leak information about the training data. In this work, we focus\non a particular type of privacy attacks named property inference attack (PIA)\nwhich infers the sensitive properties of the training data through the access\nto the target ML model. In particular, we consider Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)\nas the target model, and distribution of particular groups of nodes and links\nin the training graph as the target property. While the existing work has\ninvestigated PIAs that target at graph-level properties, no prior works have\nstudied the inference of node and link properties at group level yet.\nIn this work, we perform the first systematic study of group property\ninference attacks (GPIA) against GNNs. First, we consider a taxonomy of threat\nmodels under both black-box and white-box settings with various types of\nadversary knowledge, and design six different attacks for these settings. We\nevaluate the effectiveness of these attacks through extensive experiments on\nthree representative GNN models and three real-world graphs. Our results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of these attacks whose accuracy outperforms the\nbaseline approaches. Second, we analyze the underlying factors that contribute\nto GPIA's success, and show that the target model trained on the graphs with or\nwithout the target property represents some dissimilarity in model parameters\nand/or model outputs, which enables the adversary to infer the existence of the\nproperty. Further, we design a set of defense mechanisms against the GPIA\nattacks, and demonstrate that these mechanisms can reduce attack accuracy\neffectively with small loss on GNN model accuracy.",

Nevertheless, researchers persist in using the same outdated\nfeature extractors, and no attention has been given to the effects of different\nbackbones yet. In this paper, we start back to backbones proposing a\ncomprehensive analysis of their intrinsic generalization capabilities, so far\nignored by the research community. We evaluate a wide variety of feature\nextractors, from standard residual solutions to transformer-based\narchitectures, finding an evident linear correlation between large-scale\nsingle-domain classification accuracy and DG capability. Our extensive\nexperimentation shows that by adopting competitive backbones in conjunction\nwith effective data augmentation, plain ERM outperforms recent DG solutions and\nachieves state-of-the-art accuracy. Moreover, our additional qualitative\nstudies reveal that novel backbones give more similar representations to\nsame-class samples, separating different domains in the feature space.

    "abstract": "Multi-server queueing systems are widely used models for job scheduling in\nmachine learning, wireless networks, and crowdsourcing. This paper considers a\nmulti-server system with multiple servers and multiple types of jobs. The\nsystem maintains a separate queue for each type of jobs. For each time slot,\neach available server picks a job from a queue and then serves the job until it\nis complete. The arrival rates of the queues and the mean service times are\nunknown and even nonstationary. We propose the MaxWeight with discounted upper\nconfidence bound (UCB) algorithm, which simultaneously learns the statistics\nand schedules jobs to servers. We prove that the proposed algorithm can\nstabilize the queues when the arrival rates are strictly within the service\ncapacity region. Specifically, we prove that the queue lengths are bounded in\nthe mean under the assumption that the mean service times change relatively\nslowly over time and the arrival rates are bounded away from the capacity\nregion by a constant whose value depends on the discount factor used in the\ndiscounted UCB. Simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm can\nstabilize the queues and that it outperforms MaxWeight with empirical mean and\nMaxWeight with discounted empirical mean. The proposed algorithm is also better\nthan MaxWeight with UCB in the nonstationary setting.",

The mathematical model is\ndescribed by Navier-Stokes equation in the free flow domain $\\Omega_f$ and\nnonlinear convective Darcy-Brinkman-Forchheimer equations in porous subdomains\n$\\Omega_p$. It is well-known that numerical solutions of the problems in such\nheterogeneous domains require a very fine computational mesh that resolve\ninclusions on the grid level. The size alteration of the relevant system\nrequires model reduction techniques. Here, we present a multiscale model\nreduction technique based on the Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method\n(GMsFEM). We discuss construction of the multiscale basis functions for the\nvelocity fields based on the solution of the local problems with and without\noversampling strategy. Three test cases are considered for a given choice of\nthe three key model parameters, namely, the Reynolds number ($Re$), the\nForchheimer coefficient ($C$) and the Darcy number ($Da$). For the test runs,\nthe Reynolds number values are taken to be $Re = 1, 10, 100$ while the\nForchheimer coefficient and Darcy number are chosen as $C= 1, 10$ and $Da =\n10^{-5}, 10^{-4}, 10^{-3}$, respectively. We numerically study the convergence\nof the method as we increase the number of multiscale basis functions in each\ndomain, and observe good performance of the multiscale method.",

    "abstract": "We consider the coupled system of equations that describe flow in fractured\nporous media. To describe such types of problems, multicontinuum and multiscale\napproaches are used. Because in multicontinuum models, the permeability of each\ncontinuum has a significant difference, a large number of iterations is\nrequired for the solution of the resulting linear system of equations at each\ntime iteration. The presented decoupling technique separates equations for each\ncontinuum that can be solved separately, leading to a more efficient\ncomputational algorithm with smaller systems and faster solutions. This\napproach is based on the additive representation of the operator with\nsemi-implicit approximation by time, where the continuum coupling part is taken\nfrom the previous time layer. We apply, analyze and numerically investigate\ndecoupled schemes for classical multicontinuum problems in fractured porous\nmedia on sufficiently fine grids with finite volume approximation. We show that\nthe decoupled schemes are stable, accurate, and computationally efficient.\nNext, we extend and investigate this approach for multiscale approximation on\nthe coarse grid using the nonlocal multicontinuum (NLMC) method. In NLMC\napproximation, we construct similar decoupled schemes with the same continuum\nseparation approach. A numerical investigation is presented for model problems\nwith two and three-continuum in the two-dimensional formulation.",

Sparse-attention LMs\ncan represent longer sequences, overcoming performance hurdles.

Most\nprevious attempts to analyze this question have struggled to separate causation\nfrom correlation and used potentially biased measures like self-reported\nlearning. Here, we propose a novel approach using scheduling conflicts. When\nmultiple presentations of interest to an attendee are scheduled at the same\ntime, the attendee is less able to see them, on average. If seeing\npresentations influences future research, then conflicting presentations should\ninfluence research less than unconflicting ones. Analyzing conflicts in the\npersonalized schedules of 1960 attendees of 20 computer science conferences\nreveals that when an attendee is able to see a paper presentation, she is\nalmost twice as likely to cite the paper in her future work. The effect is\nrobust to underlying differences between attendees, papers, and paper authors,\nand is even larger for a stronger measure of influence -- citing the presented\npaper multiple times.

Attackers can exploit these prediction\nmechanisms simultaneously in order to trigger leaks about\nspeculatively-accessed data. Thus, sound reasoning about such speculative leaks\nrequires accounting for all potential mechanisms of speculation. Unfortunately,\nexisting formal models only support reasoning about fixed, hard-coded\nmechanisms of speculation, with no simple support to extend said reasoning to\nnew mechanisms.\nIn this paper we develop a framework for reasoning about composed speculative\nsemantics that capture speculation due to different mechanisms and implement it\nas part of the Spectector verification tool.

Our exploratory evaluations reveal\nthat AT induces higher gradient norm and variance compared to NT. This\nphenomenon hinders the outer optimization in AT since the convergence rate of\nMSGD is highly dependent on the variance of the gradients. To this end, we\npropose an optimization method called ENGM which regularizes the contribution\nof each input example to the average mini-batch gradients.

    "title": "Co-Imitation: Learning Design and Behaviour by Imitation",
    "abstract": "The co-adaptation of robots has been a long-standing research endeavour with\nthe goal of adapting both body and behaviour of a system for a given task,\ninspired by the natural evolution of animals. Co-adaptation has the potential\nto eliminate costly manual hardware engineering as well as improve the\nperformance of systems. The standard approach to co-adaptation is to use a\nreward function for optimizing behaviour and morphology. However, defining and\nconstructing such reward functions is notoriously difficult and often a\nsignificant engineering effort. This paper introduces a new viewpoint on the\nco-adaptation problem, which we call co-imitation: finding a morphology and a\npolicy that allow an imitator to closely match the behaviour of a demonstrator.\nTo this end we propose a co-imitation methodology for adapting behaviour and\nmorphology by matching state distributions of the demonstrator. Specifically,\nwe focus on the challenging scenario with mismatched state- and action-spaces\nbetween both agents. We find that co-imitation increases behaviour similarity\nacross a variety of tasks and settings, and demonstrate co-imitation by\ntransferring human walking, jogging and kicking skills onto a simulated\nhumanoid.",

    "abstract": "Estimation of physical quantities is at the core of most scientific research\nand the use of quantum devices promises to enhance its performances. In real\nscenarios, it is fundamental to consider that the resources are limited and\nBayesian adaptive estimation represents a powerful approach to efficiently\nallocate, during the estimation process, all the available resources. However,\nthis framework relies on the precise knowledge of the system model, retrieved\nwith a fine calibration that often results computationally and experimentally\ndemanding. Here, we introduce a model-free and deep learning-based approach to\nefficiently implement realistic Bayesian quantum metrology tasks accomplishing\nall the relevant challenges, without relying on any a-priori knowledge on the\nsystem. To overcome this need, a neural network is trained directly on\nexperimental data to learn the multiparameter Bayesian update. Then, the system\nis set at its optimal working point through feedbacks provided by a\nreinforcement learning algorithm trained to reconstruct and enhance experiment\nheuristics of the investigated quantum sensor. Notably, we prove experimentally\nthe achievement of higher estimation performances than standard methods,\ndemonstrating the strength of the combination of these two black-box algorithms\non an integrated photonic circuit.

    "abstract": "Learning spatial-temporal correspondences in cardiac motion from images is\nimportant for understanding the underlying dynamics of cardiac anatomical\nstructures. Many methods explicitly impose smoothness constraints such as the\n$\\mathcal{L}_2$ norm on the displacement vector field (DVF), while usually\nignoring biomechanical feasibility in the transformation. Other geometric\nconstraints either regularize specific regions of interest such as imposing\nincompressibility on the myocardium or introduce additional steps such as\ntraining a separate network-based regularizer on physically simulated datasets.\nIn this work, we propose an explicit biomechanics-informed prior as\nregularization on the predicted DVF in modeling a more generic biomechanically\nplausible transformation within all cardiac structures without introducing\nadditional training complexity. We validate our methods on two publicly\navailable datasets in the context of 2D MRI data and perform extensive\nexperiments to illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed\nmethods compared to other competing regularization schemes.

    "abstract": "Preconditioning has been a staple technique in optimization and machine\nlearning. It often reduces the condition number of the matrix it is applied to,\nthereby speeding up convergence of optimization algorithms. Although there are\nmany popular preconditioning techniques in practice, most lack theoretical\nguarantees for reductions in condition number. In this paper, we study the\nproblem of optimal diagonal preconditioning to achieve maximal reduction in the\ncondition number of any full-rank matrix by scaling its rows or columns\nseparately or simultaneously. We first reformulate the problem as a\nquasi-convex problem and provide a baseline bisection algorithm that is easy to\nimplement in practice, where each iteration consists of an SDP feasibility\nproblem. Then we propose a polynomial time potential reduction algorithm with\n$O(\\log(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}))$ iteration complexity, where each iteration\nconsists of a Newton update based on the Nesterov-Todd direction. Our algorithm\nis based on a formulation of the problem which is a generalized version of the\nVon Neumann optimal growth problem. Next, we specialize to one-sided optimal\ndiagonal preconditioning problems, and demonstrate that they can be formulated\nas standard dual SDP problems, to which we apply efficient customized solvers\nand study the empirical performance of our optimal diagonal preconditioners.\nOur extensive experiments on large matrices demonstrate the practical appeal of\noptimal diagonal preconditioners at reducing condition numbers compared to\nheuristics-based preconditioners.",

Recent literature reveals that deep\nlearning models, especially one-dimensional convolutional neural networks, are\npromising when dealing with digital signals from nuclear detectors. Simulations\nand experiments demonstrate the satisfactory accuracy and additional benefits\nof neural networks in this area. However, specific hardware accelerating such\nmodels for online operations still needs to be studied. In this work, we\nintroduce PulseDL-II, a system-on-chip (SoC) specially designed for\napplications of event feature (time, energy, etc.) extraction from pulses with\ndeep learning. Based on the previous version, PulseDL-II incorporates a RISC\nCPU into the system structure for better functional flexibility and integrity.\nThe neural network accelerator in the SoC adopts a three-level (arithmetic\nunit, processing element, neural network) hierarchical architecture and\nfacilitates parameter optimization of the digital design. Furthermore, we\ndevise a quantization scheme and associated implementation methods (rescale &\nbit-shift) for full compatibility with deep learning frameworks (e.g.,\nTensorFlow) within a selected subset of layer types. With the current scheme,\nthe quantization-aware training of neural networks is supported, and network\nmodels are automatically transformed into software of RISC CPU by dedicated\nscripts, with nearly no loss of accuracy. We validate PulseDL-II on field\nprogrammable gate arrays (FPGA). Finally, system validation is done with an\nexperimental setup made up of a direct digital synthesis (DDS) signal generator\nand an FPGA development board with analog-to-digital converters (ADC).

The decoder is also learned as a deep trainable network,\nand the reconstructed image measures the distortion. These methods enforce the\nlatent to follow some prior distributions.

    "abstract": "Multimodal information is frequently available in medical tasks. By combining\ninformation from multiple sources, clinicians are able to make more accurate\njudgments. In recent years, multiple imaging techniques have been used in\nclinical practice for retinal analysis: 2D fundus photographs, 3D optical\ncoherence tomography (OCT) and 3D OCT angiography, etc. Our paper investigates\nthree multimodal information fusion strategies based on deep learning to solve\nretinal analysis tasks: early fusion, intermediate fusion, and hierarchical\nfusion. The commonly used early and intermediate fusions are simple but do not\nfully exploit the complementary information between modalities. We developed a\nhierarchical fusion approach that focuses on combining features across multiple\ndimensions of the network, as well as exploring the correlation between\nmodalities. These approaches were applied to glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy\nclassification, using the public GAMMA dataset (fundus photographs and OCT) and\na private dataset of PlexElite 9000 (Carl Zeis Meditec Inc.)

    "abstract": "Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most frequent and routine diagnostic tool used\nfor monitoring heart electrical signals and evaluating its functionality. The\nhuman heart can suffer from a variety of diseases, including cardiac\narrhythmias. Arrhythmia is an irregular heart rhythm that in severe cases can\nlead to heart stroke and can be diagnosed via ECG recordings. Since early\ndetection of cardiac arrhythmias is of great importance, computerized and\nautomated classification and identification of these abnormal heart signals\nhave received much attention for the past decades. Methods: This paper\nintroduces a light deep learning approach for high accuracy detection of 8\ndifferent cardiac arrhythmias and normal rhythm. To leverage deep learning\nmethod, resampling and baseline wander removal techniques are applied to ECG\nsignals. In this study, 500 sample ECG segments were used as model inputs. The\nrhythm classification was done by an 11-layer network in an end-to-end manner\nwithout the need for hand-crafted manual feature extraction. Results: In order\nto evaluate the proposed technique, ECG signals are chosen from the two\nphysionet databases, the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database and the long-term AF\ndatabase. The proposed deep learning framework based on the combination of\nConvolutional Neural Network(CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) showed\npromising results than most of the state-of-the-art methods. The proposed\nmethod reaches the mean diagnostic accuracy of 98.24%. Conclusion: A trained\nmodel for arrhythmia classification using diverse ECG signals were successfully\ndeveloped and tested. Significance: Since the present work uses a light\nclassification technique with high diagnostic accuracy compared to other\nnotable methods, it could successfully be implemented in holter monitor devices\nfor arrhythmia detection.",

We aim to develop a\nmodel that learns strong representations from accelerometer signals, in order\nto perform robust human activity classification, while reducing the model's\nreliance on class labels. Specifically, we intend to enable cross-dataset\ntransfer learning such that our network pre-trained on a particular dataset can\nperform effective activity classification on other datasets (successive to a\nsmall amount of fine-tuning). To tackle this problem, we design our solution\nwith the intention of learning as much information from the accelerometer\nsignals as possible. As a result, we design two separate pipelines, one that\nlearns the data in time-frequency domain, and the other in time-domain alone.\nIn order to address the issues mentioned above in regards to cross-dataset\ntransfer learning, we use self-supervised contrastive learning to train each of\nthese streams. Next, each stream is fine-tuned for final classification, and\neventually the two are fused to provide the final results. We evaluate the\nperformance of the proposed solution on three datasets, namely MotionSense,\nHAPT, and HHAR, and demonstrate that our solution outperforms prior works in\nthis field. We further evaluate the performance of the method in learning\ngeneralized features, by using MobiAct dataset for pre-training and the\nremaining three datasets for the downstream classification task, and show that\nthe proposed solution achieves better performance in comparison with other\nself-supervised methods in cross-dataset transfer learning.",

    "abstract": "Traffic accidents are the leading cause of death among young people, a\nproblem that today costs an enormous number of victims. Several technologies\nhave been proposed to prevent accidents, being Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs)\none of the most promising. In this context, BCIs have been used to detect\nemotional states, concentration issues, or stressful situations, which could\nplay a fundamental role in the road since they are directly related to the\ndrivers' decisions. However, there is no extensive literature applying BCIs to\ndetect subjects' emotions in driving scenarios. In such a context, there are\nsome challenges to be solved, such as (i) the impact of performing a driving\ntask on the emotion detection and (ii) which emotions are more detectable in\ndriving scenarios. To improve these challenges, this work proposes a framework\nfocused on detecting emotions using electroencephalography with machine\nlearning and deep learning algorithms. In addition, a use case has been\ndesigned where two scenarios are presented. The first scenario consists in\nlistening to sounds as the primary task to perform, while in the second\nscenario listening to sound becomes a secondary task, being the primary task\nusing a driving simulator. In this way, it is intended to demonstrate whether\nBCIs are useful in this driving scenario. The results improve those existing in\nthe literature , achieving 99% accuracy for the detection of two emotions\n(non-stimuli and angry), 93% for three emotions (non-stimuli, angry and\nneutral) and 75% for four emotions (non-stimuli, angry, neutral and joy).",

    "abstract": "We study the computational complexity of multi-stage robust optimization\nproblems. Such multi-stage problems are formulated with alternating min/max\nquantifiers and therefore naturally fall into higher stage of the polynomial\nhierarchy. Despite this, almost no hardness result with respect to the\npolynomial hierarchy are known for robust multi-stage problems.\nIn this work, we examine the hardness of robust two-stage adjustable and\nrobust recoverable optimization with budgeted uncertainty sets. Our main\ntechnical contribution is the introduction of a technique tailored to prove\n$\\Sigma^p_3$-hardness of such problems. We highlight a difference between\ncontinuous and discrete budgeted uncertainty: In the discrete case, indeed a\nwide range of problems becomes complete for the third stage of the polynomial\nhierarchy. We highlight the TSP, independent set, and vertex cover problems as\nexamples of this behavior. However, in the continuous case this does not happen\nand all problems remain in the first stage of the hierarchy. Finally, if we\nallow the uncertainty to not only affect the objective, but also multiple\nconstraints, then this distinction disappears and even in the continuous case\nwe encounter hardness for the third stage of the hierarchy. This shows that\neven robust problems which are already NP-complete can still exhibit a\nsignificant computational difference between column-wise and row-wise\nuncertainty.",

It is also important that online\nclassification is achieved during EEG recording for many applications, to\nmonitor changes as they happen. In this paper we introduce a method based on\nMutual Information (MI), for channel selection.

    "abstract": "Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is an essential field of research towards the\nrealization of large-scale quantum computers. On the theoretical side, a lot of\neffort is put into designing error-correcting codes that protect quantum data\nfrom errors, which inevitably happen due to the noisy nature of quantum\nhardware and quantum bits (qubits). Protecting data with an error-correcting\ncode necessitates means to recover the original data, given a potentially\ncorrupted data set-a task referred to as decoding. It is vital that decoding\nalgorithms can recover error-free states in an efficient manner. While\ntheoretical properties of recent QEC methods have been extensively studied,\ngood techniques to analyze their performance in practically more relevant\nsettings is still a widely unexplored area. In this work, we propose a set of\nsoftware tools that allows to numerically experiment with so-called Quantum\nLow-Density Parity Check codes (QLDPC codes)-a broad class of codes, some of\nwhich have recently been shown to be asymptotically good. Based on that, we\nprovide an implementation of a general decoder for QLDPC codes. On top of that,\nwe propose an efficient heuristic decoder that tackles the runtime bottlenecks\nof the general QLDPC decoder while still maintaining comparable decoding\nperformance. These tools eventually allow to confirm theoretical results around\nQLDPC codes in a more practical setting and showcase the value of software\ntools (in addition to theoretical considerations) for investigating codes for\npractical applications. The resulting tool, which is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/lucasberent/qecc under the MIT license, is meant to provide\na playground for the search for \"practically good\" quantum codes.",

Also, it helps to estimate and reduce consequent\nlosses for businesses and, particularly, insurance companies. But hail\nforecasting is challenging. Data used for designing models for this purpose are\ntree-dimensional geospatial time series. Hail is a very local event with\nrespect to the resolution of available datasets. Also, hail events are rare -\nonly 1% of targets in observations are marked as \"hail\". Models for nowcasting\nand short-term hail forecasts are improving. Introducing machine learning\nmodels to the meteorology field is not new. There are also various climate\nmodels reflecting possible scenarios of climate change in the future. But there\nare no machine learning models for data-driven forecasting of changes in hail\nfrequency for a given area.\nThe first possible approach for the latter task is to ignore spatial and\ntemporal structure and develop a model capable of classifying a given vertical\nprofile of meteorological variables as favorable to hail formation or not.\nAlthough such an approach certainly neglects important information, it is very\nlight weighted and easily scalable because it treats observations as\nindependent from each other. The more advanced approach is to design a neural\nnetwork capable to process geospatial data.

    "abstract": "We prove that (additive) ordered group reducts of nonstandard models of the\nbounded arithmetical theory $\\mathsf{VTC^0}$ are recursively saturated in a\nrich language with predicates expressing the integers, rationals, and\nlogarithmically bounded numbers. Combined with our previous results on the\nconstruction of the real exponential function on completions of models of\n$\\mathsf{VTC^0}$, we show that every countable model of $\\mathsf{VTC^0}$ is an\nexponential integer part of a real-closed exponential field.",
