    "title": "Identification of Cognitive Workload during Surgical Tasks with  Multimodal Deep Learning",
    "abstract": "In operating Rooms (ORs), activities are usually different from other typical\nworking environments. In particular, surgeons are frequently exposed to\nmultiple psycho-organizational constraints that may cause negative\nrepercussions on their health and performance. This is commonly attributed to\nan increase in the associated Cognitive Workload (CWL) that results from\ndealing with unexpected and repetitive tasks, as well as large amounts of\ninformation and potentially risky cognitive overload. In this paper, a cascade\nof two machine learning approaches is suggested for the multimodal recognition\nof CWL in a number of four different surgical tasks. First, a model based on\nthe concept of transfer learning is used to identify if a surgeon is\nexperiencing any CWL. Secondly, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) uses this\ninformation to identify different types of CWL associated to each surgical\ntask. The suggested multimodal approach consider adjacent signals from\nelectroencephalogram (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and\npupil eye diameter. The concatenation of signals allows complex correlations in\nterms of time (temporal) and channel location (spatial). Data collection is\nperformed by a Multi-sensing AI Environment for Surgical Task $\\&$ Role\nOptimisation platform (MAESTRO) developed at HARMS Lab. To compare the\nperformance of the proposed methodology, a number of state-of-art machine\nlearning techniques have been implemented. The tests show that the proposed\nmodel has a precision of 93%.",

    "title": "Look Before You Leap: Improving Text-based Person Retrieval by Learning  A Consistent Cross-modal Common Manifold",
    "abstract": "The core problem of text-based person retrieval is how to bridge the\nheterogeneous gap between multi-modal data. Many previous approaches contrive\nto learning a latent common manifold mapping paradigm following a\n\\textbf{cross-modal distribution consensus prediction (CDCP)} manner. When\nmapping features from distribution of one certain modality into the common\nmanifold, feature distribution of the opposite modality is completely\ninvisible. That is to say, how to achieve a cross-modal distribution consensus\nso as to embed and align the multi-modal features in a constructed cross-modal\ncommon manifold all depends on the experience of the model itself, instead of\nthe actual situation. With such methods, it is inevitable that the multi-modal\ndata can not be well aligned in the common manifold, which finally leads to a\nsub-optimal retrieval performance. To overcome this \\textbf{CDCP dilemma}, we\npropose a novel algorithm termed LBUL to learn a Consistent Cross-modal Common\nManifold (C$^{3}$M) for text-based person retrieval. The core idea of our\nmethod, just as a Chinese saying goes, is to `\\textit{san si er hou xing}',\nnamely, to \\textbf{Look Before yoU Leap (LBUL)}. The common manifold mapping\nmechanism of LBUL contains a looking step and a leaping step. Compared to\nCDCP-based methods, LBUL considers distribution characteristics of both the\nvisual and textual modalities before embedding data from one certain modality\ninto C$^{3}$M to achieve a more solid cross-modal distribution consensus, and\nhence achieve a superior retrieval accuracy. We evaluate our proposed method on\ntwo text-based person retrieval datasets CUHK-PEDES and RSTPReid. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that the proposed LBUL outperforms previous methods and\nachieves the state-of-the-art performance.",

Although the scholarly impact of these articles has been widely\nstudied, the online interest determined by how long the research articles are\nshared online remains unclear. Being cognizant of how long a research article\nis mentioned online could be valuable information to the researchers. In this\npaper, we analyzed multiple social media platforms on which users share and/or\ndiscuss scholarly articles. We built three clusters for papers, based on the\nnumber of yearly online mentions having publication dates ranging from the year\n1920 to 2016. Using the online social media metrics for each of these three\nclusters, we built machine learning models to predict the long-term online\ninterest in research articles. We addressed the prediction task with two\ndifferent approaches: regression and classification. For the regression\napproach, the Multi-Layer Perceptron model performed best, and for the\nclassification approach, the tree-based models performed better than other\nmodels. We found that old articles are most evident in the contexts of\neconomics and industry (i.e., patents). In contrast, recently published\narticles are most evident in research platforms (i.e., Mendeley) followed by\nsocial media platforms (i.e., Twitter).",

    "abstract": "Assessing drug-target affinity is a critical step in the drug discovery and\ndevelopment process, but to obtain such data experimentally is both time\nconsuming and expensive. For this reason, computational methods for predicting\nbinding strength are being widely developed. However, these methods typically\nuse a single-task approach for prediction, thus ignoring the additional\ninformation that can be extracted from the data and used to drive the learning\nprocess. Thereafter in this work, we present a multi-task approach for binding\nstrength prediction. Our results suggest that these prediction can indeed\nbenefit from a multi-task learning approach, by utilizing added information\nfrom related tasks and multi-task induced regularization.",

    "abstract": "Tongue twisters are meaningful sentences that are difficult to pronounce. The\nprocess of automatically generating tongue twisters is challenging since the\ngenerated utterance must satisfy two conditions at once: phonetic difficulty\nand semantic meaning. Furthermore, phonetic difficulty is itself hard to\ncharacterize and is expressed in natural tongue twisters through a\nheterogeneous mix of phenomena such as alliteration and homophony. In this\npaper, we propose PANCETTA: Phoneme Aware Neural Completion to Elicit Tongue\nTwisters Automatically. We leverage phoneme representations to capture the\nnotion of phonetic difficulty, and we train language models to generate\noriginal tongue twisters on two proposed task settings. To do this, we curate a\ndataset called PANCETTA, consisting of existing English tongue twisters.\nThrough automatic and human evaluation, as well as qualitative analysis, we\nshow that PANCETTA generates novel, phonetically difficult, fluent, and\nsemantically meaningful tongue twisters.",

    "abstract": "Which volume to annotate next is a challenging problem in building medical\nimaging datasets for deep learning. One of the promising methods to approach\nthis question is active learning (AL). However, AL has been a hard nut to crack\nin terms of which AL algorithm and acquisition functions are most useful for\nwhich datasets. Also, the problem is exacerbated with which volumes to label\nfirst when there is zero labeled data to start with. This is known as the cold\nstart problem in AL. We propose two novel strategies for AL specifically for 3D\nimage segmentation. First, we tackle the cold start problem by proposing a\nproxy task and then utilizing uncertainty generated from the proxy task to rank\nthe unlabeled data to be annotated. Second, we craft a two-stage learning\nframework for each active iteration where the unlabeled data is also used in\nthe second stage as a semi-supervised fine-tuning strategy. We show the promise\nof our approach on two well-known large public datasets from medical\nsegmentation decathlon.

    "abstract": "Deep Learning (DL) models increasingly power a diversity of applications.\nUnfortunately, this pervasiveness also makes them attractive targets for\nextraction attacks which can steal the architecture, parameters, and\nhyper-parameters of a targeted DL model. Existing extraction attack studies\nhave observed varying levels of attack success for different DL models and\ndatasets, yet the underlying cause(s) behind their susceptibility often remain\nunclear. Ascertaining such root-cause weaknesses would help facilitate secure\nDL systems, though this requires studying extraction attacks in a wide variety\nof scenarios to identify commonalities across attack success and DL\ncharacteristics. The overwhelmingly high technical effort and time required to\nunderstand, implement, and evaluate even a single attack makes it infeasible to\nexplore the large number of unique extraction attack scenarios in existence,\nwith current frameworks typically designed to only operate for specific attack\ntypes, datasets and hardware platforms. In this paper we present PINCH: an\nefficient and automated extraction attack framework capable of deploying and\nevaluating multiple DL models and attacks across heterogeneous hardware\nplatforms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PINCH by empirically evaluating\na large number of previously unexplored extraction attack scenarios, as well as\nsecondary attack staging.

We are interested in finding the optimal\nrecharging schedule of the UAVs such that the travel cost is minimized and the\nprobability that no UAV runs out of charge within the planning horizon is\ngreater than a user-defined tolerance. We formulate this problem ({Risk-aware\nRecharging Rendezvous Problem (RRRP))} as an Integer Linear Program (ILP), in\nwhich the matching constraint captures the resource availability constraints\nand the knapsack constraint captures the success probability constraints.

We propose FaceTopoNet,\nan end-to-end deep model for facial expression recognition, which is capable of\nlearning an effective tree topology of the face. Our model then traverses the\nlearned tree to generate a sequence, which is then used to form an embedding to\nfeed a sequential learner. The devised model adopts one stream for learning\nstructure and one stream for learning texture. The structure stream focuses on\nthe positions of the facial landmarks, while the main focus of the texture\nstream is on the patches around the landmarks to learn textural information. We\nthen fuse the outputs of the two streams by utilizing an effective\nattention-based fusion strategy. We perform extensive experiments on four\nlarge-scale in-the-wild facial expression datasets - namely AffectNet, FER2013,\nExpW, and RAF-DB - and one lab-controlled dataset (CK+) to evaluate our\napproach. FaceTopoNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on three of the\nfive datasets and obtains competitive results on the other two datasets.

    "abstract": "Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) has been proposed as a new architecture to\nprovide efficient store-carry-and-forward data transport in satellite networks.\nSince these networks relay on scheduled contact plans, the Contact Graph\nRouting (CGR) algorithm can be used to optimize routing and data delivery\nperformance. However, in spite of the various improvements that have been made\nto CGR, there have been no significant proposals to prioritize traffic with\ndifferent quality of service requirements. In this work we propose adaptations\nto CGR that allow performance improvements when sending traffic with different\nlatency constraints, and develop a linear programming optimization model that\nworks as a performance upper bound. The simulation results of the proposed\nschemes are promising and open the debate on other ways to improve performance\nwhile meeting the particular needs of heterogeneous traffic.",

To\nsolve the problem and expedite cooperative scientific research, we propose a\nnovel differentially private sharing mechanism for genomic datasets that\nprotects the entire genomic dataset under differential privacy. To improve data\nutility of the GWAS statistics, we further develop a post-processing scheme\nthat performs optimal transport (OT) on the empirical distributions of SNP\nvalues. The distributions are also achieved in a privacy-preserving manner. We\nevaluate our approach on several real genomic datasets and show in the\nexperiments that it provides better protection against both genomic and machine\nlearning-based membership inference attacks and offers higher GWAS utility than\nthe baseline approaches.",

It\nlies at the essence of secure information flow analysis, binding-time analysis,\netc. Various calculi have been proposed in the literature for analysing\nindividual dependencies. Abadi et. al., by extending Moggi's monadic\nmetalanguage, unified several of these calculi into the Dependency Core\nCalculus (DCC). DCC has served as a foundational framework for dependency\nanalysis for the last two decades. However, in spite of its success, DCC has\nits limitations. First, the monadic bind rule of the calculus is nonstandard\nand relies upon an auxiliary protection judgement. Second, being of a monadic\nnature, the calculus cannot capture dependency analyses that possess a\ncomonadic nature, for example, the binding-time calculus, $\\lambda^{\\circ}$, of\nDavies. In this paper, we address these limitations by designing an alternative\ndependency calculus that is inspired by standard ideas from category theory.\nOur calculus is both monadic and comonadic in nature and subsumes both DCC and\n$\\lambda^{\\circ}$. Our construction explains the nonstandard bind rule and the\nprotection judgement of DCC in terms of standard categorical concepts. It also\nleads to a novel technique for proving correctness of dependency analysis. We\nuse this technique to present alternative proofs of correctness for DCC and\n$\\lambda^{\\circ}$.",

    "abstract": "Popular hypotheses about the origins of collective adaptation are related to\ntwo basic behaviours: protection from predators and a combined search for food\nresources. Among the anti-predator explanations, the predator confusion\nhypothesis suggests that groups of individuals moving in a swarm aim to\noverwhelm the predator while the dilution of risk hypothesis suggests that the\nprobability of a single prey being targeted by a predator is lower in larger\ngroups. In this paper, we explore how emergent behaviors arise from a\npredator-driven process as an adaptive response to external stimuli perceived\nas threatening. Moreover, we suggest a predator confusion process to provide a\nselective pressure for the prey to evolve group formations. We analyze the\nforaging and prey-predator dynamics evolved in terms of group density and\nformation, behavior consistency, predator evasion and success rate, and\nforaging rate. Two agents' perceptual models are compared. A local observation\nmodel, where agents can only see what's in their immediate vicinity, and a\nglobal observation model, where agents are able to see the predator at all\ntimes. Both models were evolved for predator avoidance, foraging and collision\navoidance, using reinforcement learning in a simulated game environment. Our\nresults suggest that the dilution of risk factor is sufficient to evolve group\nformations, and the predator confusion effect could play an important role in\nthe evolution of collaborative behaviors. Finally, we show how variations in\nthe information exchange of this social order can impact the global collective\nbehaviors.",

The platform must ensure the statistic\nis computed differentially privately and chooses a central level of noise to\nadd to the computation, but can also induce personalized privacy levels (or\ncosts) by giving different weights to different agents in the computation as a\nfunction of their heterogeneous privacy preferences (which are known to the\nplatform).

To address these\nproblems, this work proposes Density Volume Construction Network (DevNet), a\nnovel self-supervised monocular depth learning framework, that can consider 3D\nspatial information, and exploit stronger geometric constraints among adjacent\ncamera frustums. Instead of directly regressing the pixel value from a single\nimage, our DevNet divides the camera frustum into multiple parallel planes and\npredicts the pointwise occlusion probability density on each plane. The final\ndepth map is generated by integrating the density along corresponding rays.\nDuring the training process, novel regularization strategies and loss functions\nare introduced to mitigate photometric ambiguities and overfitting. Without\nobviously enlarging model parameters size or running time, DevNet outperforms\nseveral representative baselines on both the KITTI-2015 outdoor dataset and\nNYU-V2 indoor dataset.

However, the sizes of small graphs\ncan vary substantially with respect to the number of nodes and edges, and hence\nthe size of the combined graph can still vary considerably, especially for\nsmall batch sizes.

The algorithm extends recently\nintroduced sequence packing approaches to work on the 2D tuples of (|nodes|,\n|edges|).

We propose a\nnovel approach to constructing a homomorphism in discrete action spaces, which\nuses a partial model of environment dynamics to infer which state action pairs\nlead to the same state -- reducing the size of the state-action space by a\nfactor equal to the cardinality of the action space. We call this method\nequivalent effect abstraction. In a gridworld setting, we demonstrate\nempirically that equivalent effect abstraction can improve sample efficiency in\na model-free setting and planning efficiency for modelbased approaches.\nFurthermore, we show on cartpole that our approach outperforms an existing\nmethod for learning homomorphisms, while using 33x less training data.",

    "abstract": "Image classification models often learn to predict a class based on\nirrelevant co-occurrences between input features and an output class in\ntraining data. We call the unwanted correlations \"data biases,\" and the visual\nfeatures causing data biases \"bias factors.\" It is challenging to identify and\nmitigate biases automatically without human intervention. Therefore, we\nconducted a design study to find a human-in-the-loop solution. First, we\nidentified user tasks that capture the bias mitigation process for image\nclassification models with three experts. Then, to support the tasks, we\ndeveloped a visual analytics system called DASH that allows users to visually\nidentify bias factors, to iteratively generate synthetic images using a\nstate-of-the-art image-to-image translation model, and to supervise the model\ntraining process for improving the classification accuracy. Our quantitative\nevaluation and qualitative study with ten participants demonstrate the\nusefulness of DASH and provide lessons for future work.",

The VoiceMOS 2022 challenge provided a dataset of synthetic voice\nconversion and text-to-speech samples with subjective labels. This study looks\nat the amount of variance that can be explained in subjective ratings of speech\nquality from metadata and the distribution imbalances of the dataset. Speech\nquality models were constructed using wav2vec 2.0 with additional metadata\nfeatures that included rater groups and system identifiers and obtained\ncompetitive metrics including a Spearman rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) of\n0.934 and MSE of 0.088 at the system-level, and 0.877 and 0.198 at the\nutterance-level.

A metadata analysis showed that the system-level\nmetrics do not represent the model's system-level prediction as a result of the\nwide variation in the number of utterances used for each system on the\nvalidation and test datasets. We conclude that, in general, conditions should\nhave enough utterances in the test set to bound the sample mean error, and be\nrelatively balanced in utterance count between systems, otherwise the\nutterance-level metrics may be more reliable and interpretable.",

However, as we show in the paper, directly applying\nquantization to MLP-based models will lead to significant accuracy degradation.\nBased on our analysis, two major issues account for the accuracy gap: 1) the\nrange of activations in MLP-based models can be too large to quantize, and 2)\nspecific components in the MLP-based models are sensitive to quantization.\nConsequently, we propose to 1) apply LayerNorm to control the quantization\nrange of activations, 2) utilize bounded activation functions, 3) apply\npercentile quantization on activations, 4) use our improved module named\nmultiple token-mixing MLPs, and 5) apply linear asymmetric quantizer for\nsensitive operations.

    "abstract": "The growth in the deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in various\nindustries required the use of IoT platforms to manage, automate and control\ndevices. This introduced different commercial and open source IoT platforms for\ndevelopers and researchers to deploy. As a result, selecting one of these\nplatforms for a specific application and use case became a challenge. In this\nstudy, a guideline for selecting an open source platform is presented. The\nprocess starts by identifying a list of functional requirements that would\nreflect the requirements of an IoT system in general. This list of requirements\nis used to compare between four major open source platforms: 1) OM2M (OneM2M\nstandard), 2) IoTivity (OCF standard), LwM2M (OMA SpecWorks LwM2M standard),\nand 4) FIWARE (FIWARE standard). The purpose of this comparison is to indicate\nthe capability and limitations of the different platforms and how they satisfy\neach requirement. Afterwards, two examples are presented to demonstrate how\nthis guideline is used to select the most suitable platform for an e-health and\na smart city use case. This includes how to define each use case and all the\nrequired information that could affect the process of selecting the most\nsuitable platform for the development of the IoT platform.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural network (DNN) classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial attacks.\nAlthough the existing gradient-based attacks have achieved good performance in\nfeed-forward model and image recognition tasks, the extension for time series\nclassification in the recurrent neural network (RNN) remains a dilemma, because\nthe cyclical structure of RNN prevents direct model differentiation and the\nvisual sensitivity to perturbations of time series data challenges the\ntraditional local optimization objective to minimize perturbation. In this\npaper, an efficient and widely applicable approach called TSFool for crafting\nhigh-quality adversarial time series for the RNN classifier is proposed. We\npropose a novel global optimization objective named Camouflage Coefficient to\nconsider how well the adversarial samples hide in class clusters, and\naccordingly redefine the high-quality adversarial attack as a multi-objective\noptimization problem. We also propose a new idea to use intervalized weighted\nfinite automata (IWFA) to capture deeply embedded vulnerable samples having\notherness between features and latent manifold to guide the approximation to\nthe optimization solution. Experiments on 22 UCR datasets are conducted to\nconfirm that TSFool is a widely effective, efficient and high-quality approach\nwith 93.22% less local perturbation, 32.33% better global camouflage, and 1.12\ntimes speedup to existing methods.",

To address these issues, we propose in this paper a\nnew multi-active multi-passive (MAMP)-IRS aided wireless communication system,\nwhere a number of active and passive IRSs are deployed to assist the downlink\ncommunication in complex environment, by establishing a multi-hop reflection\npath across active and passive IRSs. An optimization problem is formulated to\nmaximize the achievable rate of a typical user by designing the\nactive-and-passive IRS routing path as well as the joint beamforming of the BS\nand selected active/passive IRSs. To draw useful insights into the optimal\ndesign, we first consider a special case of the single-active multi-passive\n(SAMP)-IRS aided system. For this case, we propose an efficient algorithm to\nobtain its optimal solution by first optimizing the joint beamforming given any\nSAMP-IRS routing path, and then optimizing the routing path by using a new path\ndecomposition method and graph theory. Next, for the general MAMP-IRS aided\nsystem, we show that its challenging beam routing optimization problem can be\nefficiently solved by a new two-phase approach. Its key idea is to first\noptimize the inner passive-IRS beam routing between each two active IRSs for\neffective channel power gain maximization, followed by an outer active-IRS beam\nrouting optimization for rate maximization.

Furthermore, we perform an empirical comparison between two\nkinds of sequence match approaches under simple fine-tuning and meta-learning.\nMeta-learning causes the transformer models' features to have high-correlation\ndimensions.

The core of Siamese feature matching is how to\nassign high feature similarity on the corresponding points between the template\nand search area for precise object localization. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel point cloud registration-driven Siamese tracking framework, with the\nintuition that spatially aligned corresponding points (via 3D registration)\ntend to achieve consistent feature representations. Specifically, our method\nconsists of two modules, including a tracking-specific nonlocal registration\nmodule and a registration-aided Sinkhorn template-feature aggregation module.\nThe registration module targets at the precise spatial alignment between the\ntemplate and search area. The tracking-specific spatial distance constraint is\nproposed to refine the cross-attention weights in the nonlocal module for\ndiscriminative feature learning. Then, we use the weighted SVD to compute the\nrigid transformation between the template and search area, and align them to\nachieve the desired spatially aligned corresponding points. For the feature\naggregation model, we formulate the feature matching between the transformed\ntemplate and search area as an optimal transport problem and utilize the\nSinkhorn optimization to search for the outlier-robust matching solution. Also,\na registration-aided spatial distance map is built to improve the matching\nrobustness in indistinguishable regions (e.g., smooth surface). Finally, guided\nby the obtained feature matching map, we aggregate the target information from\nthe template into the search area to construct the target-specific feature,\nwhich is then fed into a CenterPoint-like detection head for object\nlocalization.

    "abstract": "Transfer function (TF) plays a key role for the generation of direct volume\nrendering (DVR), by enabling accurate identification of structures of interest\n(SOIs) interactively as well as ensuring appropriate visibility of them.\nAttempts at mitigating the repetitive manual process of TF design have led to\napproaches that make use of a knowledge database consisting of pre-designed TFs\nby domain experts. In these approaches, a user navigates the knowledge database\nto find the most suitable pre-designed TF for their input volume to visualize\nthe SOIs. Although these approaches potentially reduce the workload to generate\nthe TFs, they, however, require manual TF navigation of the knowledge database,\nas well as the likely fine tuning of the selected TF to suit the input. In this\nwork, we propose a TF design approach where we introduce a new content-based\nretrieval (CBR) to automatically navigate the knowledge database. Instead of\npre-designed TFs, our knowledge database contains image volumes with SOI\nlabels. Given an input image volume, our CBR approach retrieves relevant image\nvolumes (with SOI labels) from the knowledge database; the retrieved labels are\nthen used to generate and optimize TFs of the input. This approach does not\nneed any manual TF navigation and fine tuning. For improving SOI retrieval\nperformance, we propose a two-stage CBR scheme to enable the use of local\nintensity and regional deep image feature representations in a complementary\nmanner. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach with comparison to a\nconventional CBR approach in visualization, where an intensity profile matching\nalgorithm is used, and also with potential use-cases in medical image volume\nvisualization where DVR plays an indispensable role for different clinical\nusages.",

Some research areas\nattempt to mitigate this problem. For example, in cross-lingual transfer\nlearning and multilingual training, the goal is to benefit long-tail languages\nvia the knowledge acquired from resource-rich languages.

In this study, we focus on a single low-resource language and perform\nextensive evaluation and probing experiments using cross-lingual post-training\n(XPT). To make the transfer scenario challenging, we choose Korean as the\ntarget language, as it is a language isolate and thus shares almost no typology\nwith English.

In this paper, we present\nSCULPTOR, 3D face creations with Skeleton Consistency Using a Learned\nParametric facial generaTOR, aiming to facilitate easy creation of both\nanatomically correct and visually convincing face models via a hybrid\nparametric-physical representation. At the core of SCULPTOR is LUCY, the first\nlarge-scale shape-skeleton face dataset in collaboration with plastic surgeons.\nNamed after the fossils of one of the oldest known human ancestors, our LUCY\ndataset contains high-quality Computed Tomography (CT) scans of the complete\nhuman head before and after orthognathic surgeries, critical for evaluating\nsurgery results. LUCY consists of 144 scans of 72 subjects (31 male and 41\nfemale) where each subject has two CT scans taken pre- and post-orthognathic\noperations. Based on our LUCY dataset, we learn a novel skeleton consistent\nparametric facial generator, SCULPTOR, which can create the unique and nuanced\nfacial features that help define a character and at the same time maintain\nphysiological soundness. Our SCULPTOR jointly models the skull, face geometry\nand face appearance under a unified data-driven framework, by separating the\ndepiction of a 3D face into shape blend shape, pose blend shape and facial\nexpression blend shape. SCULPTOR preserves both anatomic correctness and visual\nrealism in facial generation tasks compared with existing methods. Finally, we\nshowcase the robustness and effectiveness of SCULPTOR in various fancy\napplications unseen before.",

Methods for labeling surgical context and\nautomatic translation to MPs are presented. We propose the Leave-One-Task-Out\n(LOTO) cross validation method to evaluate a model's ability to generalize to\nan unseen task.\nResults: Our context labeling method achieves near-perfect agreement between\nconsensus labels from crowd-sourcing and expert surgeons. Segmentation of tasks\nto MPs enables the generation of separate left and right transcripts and\nsignificantly improves LOTO performance. We find that MP segmentation models\nperform best if trained on tasks with the same context and/or tasks from the\nsame dataset.\nConclusion: The proposed framework enables high-quality labeling of surgical\ndata based on context and fine-grained MPs. Modeling surgical tasks with MPs\nenables the aggregation of different datasets for training action recognition\nmodels that can generalize better to unseen tasks than models trained at the\ngesture level.\nSignificance: Our formal framework and aggregate dataset can support the\ndevelopment of models and algorithms for surgical process analysis, skill\nassessment, error detection, and autonomy.",

We prove that the new operator\nis well-defined and its outputs have a bounded dynamic range. For the noiseless\ncase, we derive a theoretically guaranteed input reconstruction approach. When\nthe input is corrupted by Gaussian noise, we exploit redundancy in higher\ndimensions to provide a bound on the error probability and show this drops to 0\nfor high enough sampling rates leading to new theoretical guarantees for the\nnoisy case.

The generator generates fake LT transfer features using\nrandom noise as input, while the discriminator distinguishes the generator's\nfake LT transfer features from real LT transfer features. The GAN is trained\nuntil the generator generates fake LT transfers that the discriminator cannot\nidentify.

    "abstract": "Reed relay serves as the fundamental component of functional testing, which\nclosely relates to the successful quality inspection of electronics. To provide\naccurate remaining useful life (RUL) estimation for reed relay, a hybrid deep\nlearning network with degradation pattern clustering is proposed based on the\nfollowing three considerations. First, multiple degradation behaviors are\nobserved for reed relay, and hence a dynamic time wrapping-based $K$-means\nclustering is offered to distinguish degradation patterns from each other.\nSecond, although proper selections of features are of great significance, few\nstudies are available to guide the selection. The proposed method recommends\noperational rules for easy implementation purposes. Third, a neural network for\nremaining useful life estimation (RULNet) is proposed to address the weakness\nof the convolutional neural network (CNN) in capturing temporal information of\nsequential data, which incorporates temporal correlation ability after\nhigh-level feature representation of convolutional operation. In this way,\nthree variants of RULNet are constructed with health indicators, features with\nself-organizing map, or features with curve fitting. Ultimately, the proposed\nhybrid model is compared with the typical baseline models, including CNN and\nlong short-term memory network (LSTM), through a practical reed relay dataset\nwith two distinct degradation manners. The results from both degradation cases\ndemonstrate that the proposed method outperforms CNN and LSTM regarding the\nindex root mean squared error.",

From the\nmodel uncertainty perspective, there is often structural information\n(dependence) among the weights of neural networks. To improve the\ngeneralizability and stability of neural text-to-SQL parsers, we propose a\nmodel uncertainty constraint to refine the query representations by enforcing\nthe output representations of different perturbed encoding networks to be\nconsistent with each other. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that our method significantly outperforms strong competitors and\nachieves new state-of-the-art results. For reproducibility, we release our code\nand data at https://github.com/AlibabaResearch/DAMO-ConvAI/tree/main/sunsql.",

    "abstract": "The metaverse is said to be the future Internet and will consist of several\nworlds called verses. This concept is being discussed a lot lately, however,\nthe security issues of these virtual worlds are not discussed enough. This\nstudy first discusses the privacy and security concerns of the metaverse.\nVirtual reality headsets are the main devices used to access the Metaverse. The\nuser needs to verify their identity to log in to the metaverse platforms, and\nthe security of this phase becomes vital. This paper aims to compare the\nsecurity of the main authentication methods that are used in virtual reality\nenvironments. Information-based, biometric, and multi-model methods are\ncompared and analyzed in terms of security. These methods aim to verify the\nuser with different data types such as 3D patterns, PIN systems, or biometric\ndata. The pros and cons are discussed. The paper also concludes with what work\ncan be done to improve the safety of these authentication methods and future\nwork.",

However, proper financial\nincentives need to be in place to enlist EV drivers to provide services to the\ngrid. In this paper, we consider two types of EV drivers who may be willing to\nprovide mobile storage service using their EVs: commuters taking a fixed route,\nand on-demand EV drivers who receive incentives from a transportation network\ncompany (TNC) and are willing to take any route. We model the behavior of each\ntype of driver using game theoretic methods, and characterize the Nash\nequilibrium (NE) of an EV battery sharing game where each EV driver withdraws\npower from the grid to charge its EV battery at the origin of a route, travels\nfrom the origin to the destination, and then discharges power back to the grid\nat the destination of the route. The driver earns a payoff that depends on the\nparticipation of other drivers and power network conditions. We characterize\nthe NE in three situations: when there are only commuters, when there are only\non-demand TNC drivers, and when the two groups of drivers co-exist.

The\nfinite volume scheme that we use for the full Euler equations is based on a\nstaggered discretization: the density unknowns are associated with a primal\nmesh, whereas the velocity unknowns are associated with a \"fictive\" dual mesh.\nAccordingly, the convection operator of the mass balance equation is derived on\nthe primal mesh, while the the convection operator of the momentum balance\nequation is discretized on the dual mesh. To avoid any hazardous interpolation\nof the unknowns on a possibly ill-defined dual mesh, the mass fluxes of the\nmomentum convection operator are computed from the mass fluxes of the mass\nbalance equation, so as to ensure the stability of the resulting operator. A\ncoherent reconstruction of these dual fluxes is possible, based only on the\nkind of considered polygonal or polyhedral cell, and not on each cell itself.\nMoreover, we show that this process still yields a consistent convection\noperator in the Lax-Wendroff sense, that is, if a sequence of piecewise\nconstant functions is supposed to converge to a a given limit, then the weak\nform of the corresponding discrete convection operator converges to the weak\nform of the continuous operator applied to this limit. The derived discrete\nconvection operator applies to both constant and variable density flows and may\nthus be implemented in a scheme for incompressible or compressible flows.\nNumerical tests are performed for the Euler equations on several types of mesh,\nincluding hybrid meshes, and show the excellent performance of the method.",

Specifically, to learn the\ninformation embedded in a paragraph and the relations among the corresponding\ncomponent sentences, we utilize linguistics-aware and prosody-aware networks.\nThe information in a paragraph is captured by encoders and the inter-sentence\ninformation in a paragraph is learned with multi-head attention mechanisms. The\nrelative sentence position in a paragraph is explicitly exploited by a\nsentence-position network. Trained on a storytelling audio-book corpus (4.08\nhours), recorded by a female Mandarin Chinese speaker, the proposed TTS model\ndemonstrates that it can produce rather natural and good-quality speech\nparagraph-wise. The cross-sentence contextual information, such as break and\nprosodic variations between consecutive sentences, can be better predicted and\nrendered than the sentence-based model. Tested on paragraph texts, of which the\nlengths are similar to, longer than, or much longer than the typical paragraph\nlength of the training data, the TTS speech produced by the new model is\nconsistently preferred over the sentence-based model in subjective tests and\nconfirmed in objective measures.",

Because of the decentralization of nodes and the\nsecurity needs of communications, management of MANETs must be self-organized,\nwhich is a major research challenge. In order to cope with the intrinsic\nproperties of MANETs, a new decentralized management system for MANETs called\nSelf-organizing Life Cycle Management (SLCM), is here fully described and\nevaluated. Regarding security, node authentication is the most critical\ncomponent of access control in any network, and in particular in MANETs.\nBroadcasting is also a fundamental data dissemination mechanism in these\nnetworks. Both aspects have received special attention when defining the\nproposed SLCM system. In particular, both a strong access control algorithm\nbased on the cryptographic paradigm of zero-knowledge proofs, and a three-step\nbroadcast protocol, are here defined. This work includes the performance\nevaluation of the scheme, and the obtained experimental results show that SLCM\nsignificantly improves both the quality and the security of life cycle\nmanagement of self-organized MANETs.",

    "abstract": "Neural text ranking models have witnessed significant advancement and are\nincreasingly being deployed in practice. Unfortunately, they also inherit\nadversarial vulnerabilities of general neural models, which have been detected\nbut remain underexplored by prior studies. Moreover, the inherit adversarial\nvulnerabilities might be leveraged by blackhat SEO to defeat better-protected\nsearch engines. In this study, we propose an imitation adversarial attack on\nblack-box neural passage ranking models. We first show that the target passage\nranking model can be transparentized and imitated by enumerating critical\nqueries/candidates and then train a ranking imitation model. Leveraging the\nranking imitation model, we can elaborately manipulate the ranking results and\ntransfer the manipulation attack to the target ranking model. For this purpose,\nwe propose an innovative gradient-based attack method, empowered by the\npairwise objective function, to generate adversarial triggers, which causes\npremeditated disorderliness with very few tokens. To equip the trigger\ncamouflages, we add the next sentence prediction loss and the language model\nfluency constraint to the objective function. Experimental results on passage\nranking demonstrate the effectiveness of the ranking imitation attack model and\nadversarial triggers against various SOTA neural ranking models. Furthermore,\nvarious mitigation analyses and human evaluation show the effectiveness of\ncamouflages when facing potential mitigation approaches.

Although\nSeLo has been carried out successively, but there is currently no work has\nsystematically explores and analyzes this urgent direction. In this paper, we\nthoroughly study this field and provide a complete benchmark in terms of\nmetrics and testdata to advance the SeLo task. Firstly, based on the\ncharacteristics of this task, we propose multiple discriminative evaluation\nmetrics to quantify the performance of the SeLo task. The devised significant\narea proportion, attention shift distance, and discrete attention distance are\nutilized to evaluate the generated SeLo map from pixel-level and region-level.\nNext, to provide standard evaluation data for the SeLo task, we contribute a\ndiverse, multi-semantic, multi-objective Semantic Localization Testset\n(AIR-SLT). AIR-SLT consists of 22 large-scale RS images and 59 test cases with\ndifferent semantics, which aims to provide a comprehensive evaluations for\nretrieval models.

We have also\nestablished a new paradigm for RS referring expression comprehension, and\ndemonstrated the great advantage of SeLo in semantics through combining it with\ntasks such as detection and road extraction.

    "abstract": "Neural forecasting of spatiotemporal time series drives both research and\nindustrial innovation in several relevant application domains. Graph neural\nnetworks (GNNs) are often the core component of the forecasting architecture.\nHowever, in most spatiotemporal GNNs, the computational complexity scales up to\na quadratic factor with the length of the sequence times the number of links in\nthe graph, hence hindering the application of these models to large graphs and\nlong temporal sequences. While methods to improve scalability have been\nproposed in the context of static graphs, few research efforts have been\ndevoted to the spatiotemporal case. To fill this gap, we propose a scalable\narchitecture that exploits an efficient encoding of both temporal and spatial\ndynamics. In particular, we use a randomized recurrent neural network to embed\nthe history of the input time series into high-dimensional state\nrepresentations encompassing multi-scale temporal dynamics. Such\nrepresentations are then propagated along the spatial dimension using different\npowers of the graph adjacency matrix to generate node embeddings characterized\nby a rich pool of spatiotemporal features. The resulting node embeddings can be\nefficiently pre-computed in an unsupervised manner, before being fed to a\nfeed-forward decoder that learns to map the multi-scale spatiotemporal\nrepresentations to predictions. The training procedure can then be parallelized\nnode-wise by sampling the node embeddings without breaking any dependency, thus\nenabling scalability to large networks. Empirical results on relevant datasets\nshow that our approach achieves results competitive with the state of the art,\nwhile dramatically reducing the computational burden.",

The whole\nmethod consists of three parts. The first part consists of fully-convolutional\ndensely connected layers that computes expressive features of rectified image\npairs. The second part of our network learns highly accurate similarity\nfunctions between this learned features. It consists of densely-connected\nconvolution layers with a deformable convolution block at the end to further\nimprove the accuracy of the results. After this step an initial disparity map\nis created and the left-right consistency check is performed in order to remove\ninconsistent points. The last part of the network then uses this input together\nwith the corresponding left RGB image in order to train a network that fills in\nthe missing measurements.

Existing tactile surface reconstruction methods rely on external sensors\nor have strong prior assumptions, which will limit their application scenarios\nand make the operation more complex. This paper presents a surface\nreconstruction algorithm that uses only a new vision-based tactile sensor where\nthe surface structure of an unfamiliar object is reconstructed by multiple\ntactile measurements. Compared with existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm\ndoesn't rely on external devices and focuses on improving the reconstruction\naccuracy of the large-scale object surface. Aiming at the difficulty that the\nreconstruction accuracy is easily affected by the pressure of sampling, we\npropose a correction algorithm to adapt it. Multi-frame tactile imprints\ngenerated from many times contact can accurately reconstruct global object\nsurface by jointly using the point cloud registration algorithm, loop-closure\ndetection algorithm based on deep learning, and pose graph optimization\nalgorithm. Experiments verify the proposed algorithm can achieve\nmillimeter-level accuracy in reconstructing the surface of interactive objects\nand provide accurate tactile information for the robot to perceive the\nsurrounding environment.",

The intuitive understanding of these programs\nfits the computational mindset of software system engineers and is supported by\na simple but precise behavioural definition. Therefore, they can be smoothly\nintegrated in the practitioner's daily work to rigorously formulate every\ndesign and implementation decision taken on the path from the Executable\nAbstract Program for the requirements to the targeted and efficiently runnable\ncode.\nThe Executable Abstract Programs of the resulting system documentation\nrepresent definitions of implementation steps one can check and justify by\ntesting (due to their executable character) or by reasoning (due to the\nmathematical definition of their behaviour). For complex systems the\nimplementation involves multiple (orthogonal or successive) implementation\nsteps which represent instances of a practical computational refinement\nconcept. Such a system development process is driven by computational\nrefinements and is strictly limited to explicitly formulate and justify --\nbesides the requirements -- only the necessary implementation steps. As a\nconsequence, it produces as side-effect a corpus of documentation that\nfacilitates the understandability of the final code and improves its\nreliability and resilience; it also enhances the maintenance process (including\nreuse and change of abstract programs and code) and reduces maintenance cost.",

    "abstract": "Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has emerged as an effective tool for\nlearning unsupervised representations of graphs. The key idea is to maximize\nthe agreement between two augmented views of each graph via data augmentation.\nExisting GCL models mainly focus on applying \\textit{identical augmentation\nstrategies} for all graphs within a given scenario. However, real-world graphs\nare often not monomorphic but abstractions of diverse natures. Even within the\nsame scenario (e.g., macromolecules and online communities), different graphs\nmight need diverse augmentations to perform effective GCL. Thus, blindly\naugmenting all graphs without considering their individual characteristics may\nundermine the performance of GCL arts.To deal with this, we propose the first\nprincipled framework, termed as \\textit{G}raph contrastive learning with\n\\textit{P}ersonalized \\textit{A}ugmentation (GPA), to advance conventional GCL\nby allowing each graph to choose its own suitable augmentation operations.In\nessence, GPA infers tailored augmentation strategies for each graph based on\nits topology and node attributes via a learnable augmentation selector, which\nis a plug-and-play module and can be effectively trained with downstream GCL\nmodels end-to-end. Extensive experiments across 11 benchmark graphs from\ndifferent types and domains demonstrate the superiority of GPA against\nstate-of-the-art competitors.Moreover, by visualizing the learned augmentation\ndistributions across different types of datasets, we show that GPA can\neffectively identify the most suitable augmentations for each graph based on\nits characteristics.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel architecture for simultaneous estimation of\nhighly accurate optical flows and rigid scene transformations for difficult\nscenarios where the brightness assumption is violated by strong shading\nchanges. In the case of rotating objects or moving light sources, such as those\nencountered for driving cars in the dark, the scene appearance often changes\nsignificantly from one view to the next. Unfortunately, standard methods for\ncalculating optical flows or poses are based on the expectation that the\nappearance of features in the scene remain constant between views. These\nmethods may fail frequently in the investigated cases. The presented method\nfuses texture and geometry information by combining image, vertex and normal\ndata to compute an illumination-invariant optical flow. By using a\ncoarse-to-fine strategy, globally anchored optical flows are learned, reducing\nthe impact of erroneous shading-based pseudo-correspondences. Based on the\nlearned optical flows, a second architecture is proposed that predicts robust\nrigid transformations from the warped vertex and normal maps. Particular\nattention is payed to situations with strong rotations, which often cause such\nshading changes. Therefore a 3-step procedure is proposed that profitably\nexploits correlations between the normals and vertices. The method has been\nevaluated on a newly created dataset containing both synthetic and real data\nwith strong rotations and shading effects. This data represents the typical use\ncase in 3D reconstruction, where the object often rotates in large steps\nbetween the partial reconstructions. Additionally, we apply the method to the\nwell-known Kitti Odometry dataset. Even if, due to fulfillment of the brighness\nassumption, this is not the typical use case of the method, the applicability\nto standard situations and the relation to other methods is therefore\nestablished.",

To analyse the data and examine the hypothesised influences and\nmoderations we use universal structure modelling based on a structural equation\nmodel. Universal structure modelling will produce significance values and path\ncoefficients for each hypothesised and modelled interdependence between factors\nand quality attributes that can be used to confirm or reject correlation and to\nweigh the strength of influence present.\nLimitations: Due to the complexity and abstractness of the concepts under\ninvestigation, a measurement via reflective or formative indicators is not\npossible.

    "title": "One-Shot Doc Snippet Detection: Powering Search in Document Beyond Text",
    "abstract": "Active consumption of digital documents has yielded scope for research in\nvarious applications, including search. Traditionally, searching within a\ndocument has been cast as a text matching problem ignoring the rich layout and\nvisual cues commonly present in structured documents, forms, etc. To that end,\nwe ask a mostly unexplored question: \"Can we search for other similar snippets\npresent in a target document page given a single query instance of a document\nsnippet?\". We propose MONOMER to solve this as a one-shot snippet detection\ntask. MONOMER fuses context from visual, textual, and spatial modalities of\nsnippets and documents to find query snippet in target documents. We conduct\nextensive ablations and experiments showing MONOMER outperforms several\nbaselines from one-shot object detection (BHRL), template matching, and\ndocument understanding (LayoutLMv3). Due to the scarcity of relevant data for\nthe task at hand, we train MONOMER on programmatically generated data having\nmany visually similar query snippets and target document pairs from two\ndatasets - Flamingo Forms and PubLayNet. We also do a human study to validate\nthe generated data.",

    "abstract": "Multi-label image classification allows predicting a set of labels from a\ngiven image. Unlike multiclass classification, where only one label per image\nis assigned, such setup is applicable for a broader range of applications. In\nthis work we revisit two popular approaches to multilabel classification:\ntransformer-based heads and labels relations information graph processing\nbranches. Although transformer-based heads are considered to achieve better\nresults than graph-based branches, we argue that with the proper training\nstrategy graph-based methods can demonstrate just a small accuracy drop, while\nspending less computational resources on inference. In our training strategy,\ninstead of Asymmetric Loss (ASL), which is the de-facto standard for multilabel\nclassification, we introduce its modification acting in the angle space. It\nimplicitly learns a proxy feature vector on the unit hypersphere for each\nclass, providing a better discrimination ability, than binary cross entropy\nloss does on unnormalized features. With the proposed loss and training\nstrategy, we obtain SOTA results among single modality methods on widespread\nmultilabel classification benchmarks such as MS-COCO, PASCAL-VOC, NUS-Wide and\nVisual Genome 500.

It provides\napplications with outstanding benefits, including reduced response latency and\nenhanced privacy protection. For emerging advanced applications, such as\nautonomous vehicles, industrial IoT, and metaverse, further research is needed.\nThis is because such applications demand ultra-low latency, hyper-connectivity,\nand dynamic and reliable service provision, while existing approaches are\ninadequate to address the new challenges. Hence, we envision that the future\nedge computing is moving towards distributed intelligence, where heterogeneous\nedge nodes collaborate to provide services in large-scale and geo-distributed\nedge infrastructure. We thereby propose Edge-as-a-Service (EaaS) to enable\ndistributed intelligence. EaaS jointly manages large-scale cross-node edge\nresources and facilitates edge autonomy, edge-to-edge collaboration, and\nresource elasticity. These features enable flexible deployment of services and\nubiquitous computation and intelligence. We first give an overview of existing\nedge computing studies and discuss their limitations to articulate the\nmotivation for proposing EaaS. Then, we describe the details of EaaS, including\nthe physical architecture, proposed software framework, and benefits of EaaS.\nVarious application scenarios, such as real-time video surveillance, smart\nbuilding, and metaverse, are presented to illustrate the significance and\npotential of EaaS.

    "abstract": "Sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) is the task of retrieving natural images\n(photos) that match the semantics and the spatial configuration of hand-drawn\nsketch queries. The universality of sketches extends the scope of possible\napplications and increases the demand for efficient SBIR solutions. In this\npaper, we study classic triplet-based SBIR solutions and show that a persistent\ninvariance to horizontal flip (even after model finetuning) is harming\nperformance. To overcome this limitation, we propose several approaches and\nevaluate in depth each of them to check their effectiveness. Our main\ncontributions are twofold: We propose and evaluate several intuitive\nmodifications to build SBIR solutions with better flip equivariance. We show\nthat vision transformers are more suited for the SBIR task, and that they\noutperform CNNs with a large margin. We carried out numerous experiments and\nintroduce the first models to outperform human performance on a large-scale\nSBIR benchmark (Sketchy). Our best model achieves a recall of 62.25% (at k = 1)\non the sketchy benchmark compared to previous state-of-the-art methods 46.2%.",

For\nexample, when writing papers or articles, we usually first write drafts, and\nthen iteratively polish them until satisfied. In light of such a human\ncognitive process, we propose DECOM, which is a multi-pass deliberation\nframework for automatic comment generation. DECOM consists of multiple\nDeliberation Models and one Evaluation Model. Given a code snippet, we first\nextract keywords from the code and retrieve a similar code fragment from a\npre-defined corpus. Then, we treat the comment of the retrieved code as the\ninitial draft and input it with the code and keywords into DECOM to start the\niterative deliberation process. At each deliberation, the deliberation model\npolishes the draft and generates a new comment. The evaluation model measures\nthe quality of the newly generated comment to determine whether to end the\niterative process or not. When the iterative process is terminated, the\nbest-generated comment will be selected as the target comment. Our approach is\nevaluated on two real-world datasets in Java (87K) and Python (108K), and\nexperiment results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art\nbaselines.

However, current contrastive\nlearning solely considers the self-augmented dialog samples as positive samples\nand treats all other dialog samples as negative ones, which enforces dissimilar\nrepresentations even for dialogs that are semantically related. In this paper,\nwe propose SPACE-2, a tree-structured pre-trained conversation model, which\nlearns dialog representations from limited labeled dialogs and large-scale\nunlabeled dialog corpora via semi-supervised contrastive pre-training.\nConcretely, we first define a general semantic tree structure (STS) to unify\nthe inconsistent annotation schema across different dialog datasets, so that\nthe rich structural information stored in all labeled data can be exploited.\nThen we propose a novel multi-view score function to increase the relevance of\nall possible dialogs that share similar STSs and only push away other\ncompletely different dialogs during supervised contrastive pre-training. To\nfully exploit unlabeled dialogs, a basic self-supervised contrastive loss is\nalso added to refine the learned representations.

Compared to traditional single-turn question generation (SQG),\nCQG is more challenging in the sense that the generated question is required\nnot only to be meaningful, but also to align with the occurred conversation\nhistory. While previous studies mainly focus on how to model the flow and\nalignment of the conversation, there has been no thorough study to date on\nwhich parts of the context and history are necessary for the model. We argue\nthat shortening the context and history is crucial as it can help the model to\noptimise more on the conversational alignment property.

However, most existing pre-trained models for TOD focus\non either dialog understanding or dialog generation, but not both. In this\npaper, we propose SPACE-3, a novel unified semi-supervised pre-trained\nconversation model learning from large-scale dialog corpora with limited\nannotations, which can be effectively fine-tuned on a wide range of downstream\ndialog tasks. Specifically, SPACE-3 consists of four successive components in a\nsingle transformer to maintain a task-flow in TOD systems: (i) a dialog\nencoding module to encode dialog history, (ii) a dialog understanding module to\nextract semantic vectors from either user queries or system responses, (iii) a\ndialog policy module to generate a policy vector that contains high-level\nsemantics of the response, and (iv) a dialog generation module to produce\nappropriate responses. We design a dedicated pre-training objective for each\ncomponent. Concretely, we pre-train the dialog encoding module with span mask\nlanguage modeling to learn contextualized dialog information. To capture the\nstructured dialog semantics, we pre-train the dialog understanding module via a\nnovel tree-induced semi-supervised contrastive learning objective with the help\nof extra dialog annotations. In addition, we pre-train the dialog policy module\nby minimizing the L2 distance between its output policy vector and the semantic\nvector of the response for policy optimization. Finally, the dialog generation\nmodel is pre-trained by language modeling. Results show that SPACE-3 achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on eight downstream dialog benchmarks, including\nintent prediction, dialog state tracking, and end-to-end dialog modeling.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel grasp pipeline based on contact point\ndetection on the truncated signed distance function (TSDF) volume to achieve\nclosed-loop 7-degree-of-freedom (7-DoF) grasping on cluttered environments. The\nkey aspects of our method are that 1) the proposed pipeline exploits the TSDF\nvolume in terms of multi-view fusion, contact-point sampling and evaluation,\nand collision checking, which provides reliable and collision-free 7-DoF\ngripper poses with real-time performance; 2) the contact-based pose\nrepresentation effectively eliminates the ambiguity introduced by the\nnormal-based methods, which provides a more precise and flexible solution.\nExtensive simulated and real-robot experiments demonstrate that the proposed\npipeline can select more antipodal and stable grasp poses and outperforms\nnormal-based baselines in terms of the grasp success rate in both simulated and\nphysical scenarios.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new concept called virtual inertia scheduling (VIS) to\nefficiently handle the high penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs). VIS\nis an inertia management framework that targets security-constrained and\neconomy-oriented inertia scheduling and generation dispatch of power systems\nwith a large scale of renewable generations. Specifically, it schedules the\nproper power setting points and reserved capacities of both synchronous\ngenerators and IBRs, as well as the control modes and control parameters of\nIBRs to provide secure and cost-effective inertia support. First, a uniform\nsystem model is employed to quantify the frequency dynamics of the\nIBRs-penetrated power system after disturbances. Based on the model, the\ns-domain and time-domain analytical responses of IBRs with inertia support\ncapability are derived. Then, VIS-based real-time economic dispatch (VIS-RTED)\nis formulated to minimize generation and reserve costs, with a full\nconsideration of dynamic frequency constraints and derived inertia support\nreserve constraints. The virtual inertia and damping of IBRs are formulated as\ndecision variables. To address the non-linearity of dynamic constraints, deep\nlearning-assisted linearization is employed to solve the optimization problem.\nFinally, the proposed VIS-RTED is demonstrated on a modified IEEE 39-bus\nsystem. A full-order time-domain simulation is performed to verify the\nscheduling results.",

    "abstract": "Recent deep learning approaches for multi-view depth estimation are employed\neither in a depth-from-video or a multi-view stereo setting. Despite different\nsettings, these approaches are technically similar: they correlate multiple\nsource views with a keyview to estimate a depth map for the keyview. In this\nwork, we introduce the Robust Multi-View Depth Benchmark that is built upon a\nset of public datasets and allows evaluation in both settings on data from\ndifferent domains.

Further, we consider a third setting, where camera\nposes are available and the objective is to estimate the corresponding depth\nmaps with their correct scale. We show that recent approaches do not generalize\nacross datasets in this setting. This is because their cost volume output runs\nout of distribution. To resolve this, we present the Robust MVD Baseline model\nfor multi-view depth estimation, which is built upon existing components but\nemploys a novel scale augmentation procedure. It can be applied for robust\nmulti-view depth estimation, independent of the target data.

    "abstract": "The ability of language to perpetuate inequality is most evident when\nindividuals refer to, or talk about, other individuals in their utterances.\nWhile current studies of bias in NLP rely mainly on identifying hate speech or\nbias towards a specific group, we believe we can reach a more subtle and\nnuanced understanding of the interaction between bias and language use by\nmodeling the speaker, the text, and the target in the text. In this paper, we\nintroduce a dataset of 3033 English tweets by US Congress members annotated for\ninterpersonal emotion, and `found supervision' for interpersonal group\nmembership labels. We find that negative emotions such as anger and disgust are\nused predominantly in out-group situations, and directed predominantly at\nleaders of opposite parties. While humans can perform better than chance at\nidentifying interpersonal group membership given an utterance, neural models\nperform much better; furthermore, a shared encoding between interpersonal group\nmembership and interpersonal perceived emotion enabled some performance gains\nin the latter. This work aims to re-align the study of bias in NLP away from\nspecific instances of bias to one which encapsulates the relationship between\nspeaker, text, target and social dynamics.

    "abstract": "Neural ranking models (NRMs) have achieved promising results in information\nretrieval. NRMs have also been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial examples.\nA typical Word Substitution Ranking Attack (WSRA) against NRMs was proposed\nrecently, in which an attacker promotes a target document in rankings by adding\nhuman-imperceptible perturbations to its text. This raises concerns when\ndeploying NRMs in real-world applications. Therefore, it is important to\ndevelop techniques that defend against such attacks for NRMs. In empirical\ndefenses adversarial examples are found during training and used to augment the\ntraining set. However, such methods offer no theoretical guarantee on the\nmodels' robustness and may eventually be broken by other sophisticated WSRAs.\nTo escape this arms race, rigorous and provable certified defense methods for\nNRMs are needed.\nTo this end, we first define the \\textit{Certified Top-$K$ Robustness} for\nranking models since users mainly care about the top ranked results in\nreal-world scenarios. A ranking model is said to be Certified Top-$K$ Robust on\na ranked list when it is guaranteed to keep documents that are out of the top\n$K$ away from the top $K$ under any attack. Then, we introduce a Certified\nDefense method, named CertDR, to achieve certified top-$K$ robustness against\nWSRA, based on the idea of randomized smoothing. Specifically, we first\nconstruct a smoothed ranker by applying random word substitutions on the\ndocuments, and then leverage the ranking property jointly with the statistical\nproperty of the ensemble to provably certify top-$K$ robustness. Extensive\nexperiments on two representative web search datasets demonstrate that CertDR\ncan significantly outperform state-of-the-art empirical defense methods for\nranking models.",

Our evaluation shows that Cornucopia was able to generate 309K\nbinaries across four architectures (x86, x64, ARM, MIPS) with an average of 403\nbinaries for each program and outperforms Bintuner, a similar technique. Our\nexperiments revealed issues with the LLVM optimization scheduler resulting in\ncompiler crashes ($\\sim$300). Our evaluation of four popular binary analysis\ntools Angr, Ghidra, Idapro, and Radare, using Cornucopia generated binaries,\nrevealed various issues with these tools. Specifically, we found 263 crashes in\nAngr and one memory corruption issue in Idapro. Our differential testing on the\nanalysis results revealed various semantic bugs in these tools. We also tested\nmachine learning tools, Asmvec, Safe, and Debin, that claim to capture binary\nsemantics and show that they perform poorly (For instance, Debin F1 score\ndropped to 12.9% from reported 63.1%) on Cornucopia generated binaries.

    "abstract": "Within textual emotion classification, the set of relevant labels depends on\nthe domain and application scenario and might not be known at the time of model\ndevelopment. This conflicts with the classical paradigm of supervised learning\nin which the labels need to be predefined. A solution to obtain a model with a\nflexible set of labels is to use the paradigm of zero-shot learning as a\nnatural language inference task, which in addition adds the advantage of not\nneeding any labeled training data. This raises the question how to prompt a\nnatural language inference model for zero-shot learning emotion classification.\nOptions for prompt formulations include the emotion name anger alone or the\nstatement \"This text expresses anger\". With this paper, we analyze how\nsensitive a natural language inference-based zero-shot-learning classifier is\nto such changes to the prompt under consideration of the corpus: How carefully\ndoes the prompt need to be selected? We perform experiments on an established\nset of emotion datasets presenting different language registers according to\ndifferent sources (tweets, events, blogs) with three natural language inference\nmodels and show that indeed the choice of a particular prompt formulation needs\nto fit to the corpus.

A new and independent validation and test set is formed with\nscene text instances that are out of vocabulary at training time. The\ncompetition was structured in two tasks, end-to-end and cropped scene text\nrecognition respectively. A thorough analysis of results from baselines and\ndifferent participants is presented. Interestingly, current state-of-the-art\nmodels show a significant performance gap under the newly studied setting. We\nconclude that the OOV dataset proposed in this challenge will be an essential\narea to be explored in order to develop scene text models that achieve more\nrobust and generalized predictions.",

    "abstract": "Any approach aimed at pasteurizing and quantifying a particular phenomenon\nmust include the use of robust statistical methodologies for data analysis.\nWith this in mind, the purpose of this study is to present statistical\napproaches that may be employed in nonparametric nonhomogeneous data\nframeworks, as well as to examine their application in the field of natural\nlanguage processing and language clustering. Furthermore, this paper discusses\nthe many uses of nonparametric approaches in linguistic data mining and\nprocessing. The data depth idea allows for the centre-outward ordering of\npoints in any dimension, resulting in a new nonparametric multivariate\nstatistical analysis that does not require any distributional assumptions. The\nconcept of hierarchy is used in historical language categorisation and\nstructuring, and it aims to organise and cluster languages into subfamilies\nusing the same premise. In this regard, the current study presents a novel\napproach to language family structuring based on non-parametric approaches\nproduced from a typological structure of words in various languages, which is\nthen converted into a Cartesian framework using MDS. This\nstatistical-depth-based architecture allows for the use of data-depth-based\nmethodologies for robust outlier detection, which is extremely useful in\nunderstanding the categorization of diverse borderline languages and allows for\nthe re-evaluation of existing classification systems. Other depth-based\napproaches are also applied to processes such as unsupervised and supervised\nclustering. This paper therefore provides an overview of procedures that can be\napplied to nonhomogeneous language classification systems in a nonparametric\nframework.",

In this study, we propose to leverage\nnatural language processing techniques to improve health literacy in patient\neducation materials by automatically translating illiterate languages in a\ngiven sentence.

We also verified the effectiveness of NMT models in translating health\nilliterate languages by comparing the ratio of health illiterate language in\nthe sentence.

    "abstract": "Monitoring plankton populations in situ is fundamental to preserve the\naquatic ecosystem. Plankton microorganisms are in fact susceptible of minor\nenvironmental perturbations, that can reflect into consequent morphological and\ndynamical modifications. Nowadays, the availability of advanced automatic or\nsemi-automatic acquisition systems has been allowing the production of an\nincreasingly large amount of plankton image data. The adoption of machine\nlearning algorithms to classify such data may be affected by the significant\ncost of manual annotation, due to both the huge quantity of acquired data and\nthe numerosity of plankton species. To address these challenges, we propose an\nefficient unsupervised learning pipeline to provide accurate classification of\nplankton microorganisms. We build a set of image descriptors exploiting a\ntwo-step procedure. First, a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is trained on\nfeatures extracted by a pre-trained neural network. We then use the learnt\nlatent space as image descriptor for clustering. We compare our method with\nstate-of-the-art unsupervised approaches, where a set of pre-defined\nhand-crafted features is used for clustering of plankton images. The proposed\npipeline outperforms the benchmark algorithms for all the plankton datasets\nincluded in our analysis, providing better image embedding properties.",

    "abstract": "Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are usually complex and safety-critical; hence,\nit is difficult and important to guarantee that the system's requirements,\ni.e., specifications, are fulfilled. Simulation-based falsification of CPSs is\na practical testing method that can be used to raise confidence in the\ncorrectness of the system by only requiring that the system under test can be\nsimulated. As each simulation is typically computationally intensive, an\nimportant step is to reduce the number of simulations needed to falsify a\nspecification. We study Bayesian optimization (BO), a sample-efficient method\nthat learns a surrogate model that describes the relationship between the\nparametrization of possible input signals and the evaluation of the\nspecification.\nIn this paper, we improve the falsification using BO by; first adopting two\nprominent BO methods, one fits local surrogate models, and the other exploits\nthe user's prior knowledge. Secondly, the formulation of acquisition functions\nfor falsification is addressed in this paper. Benchmark evaluation shows\nsignificant improvements in using local surrogate models of BO for falsifying\nbenchmark examples that were previously hard to falsify. Using prior knowledge\nin the falsification process is shown to be particularly important when the\nsimulation budget is limited. For some of the benchmark problems, the choice of\nacquisition function clearly affects the number of simulations needed for\nsuccessful falsification.",

    "title": "Vibration Compensation of Delta 3D Printer with Position-varying  Dynamics using Filtered B-Splines",
    "abstract": "The delta robot is becoming a popular choice for the mechanical design of\nfused filament fabrication 3D printers because it can reach higher speeds than\ntraditional serial-axis designs. Like serial 3D printers, delta printers suffer\nfrom undesirable vibration at high speeds which degrades the quality of\nfabricated parts. This undesirable vibration has been suppressed in serial\nprinters using linear model-inversion feedforward control methods like the\nfiltered B-splines (FBS) approach. However, techniques like the FBS approach\nare computationally challenging to implement on delta 3D printers because of\ntheir coupled, position-dependent dynamics. In this paper, we propose a\nmethodology to address the computational bottlenecks by (1) parameterizing the\nposition-dependent portions of the dynamics offline to enable efficient online\nmodel generation, (2) computing real-time models at sampled points (instead of\nevery point) along the given trajectory, and (3) employing QR factorization to\nreduce the number of floating-point arithmetic operations associated with\nmatrix inversion. In simulations, we report a computation time reduction of up\nto 23x using the proposed method, while maintaining high accuracy, when\ncompared to a controller using the computationally expensive exact LPV model.\nIn experiments, we demonstrate significant quality improvements on parts\nprinted at various positions on the delta 3D printer using our proposed\ncontroller compared to a baseline alternative, which uses an LTI model from one\nposition. Through acceleration measurements during printing, we also show that\nthe print quality boost of the proposed controller is due to vibration\nreductions of more than 20\\% when compared to the baseline controller.",

MGG implements an optimized\npipeline-centric kernel. It includes workload interleaving and warp-based\nmapping for efficient GPU kernel operation pipelining and specialized memory\ndesigns and optimizations for better data access performance. Besides, MGG\nincorporates lightweight analytical modeling and optimization heuristics to\ndynamically improve the GNN execution performance for different settings at\nruntime. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MGG outperforms\nstate-of-the-art multi-GPU systems across various GNN settings: on average\n3.65X faster than multi-GPU systems with a unified virtual memory design and on\naverage 7.38X faster than the DGCL framework.",

    "abstract": "The real world and its geographic objects are modeled and represented in\ndifferent spatial databases. Each of these databases provides only a partial\ndescription (in space and time) of the geographic objects represented.\nSometimes, producers and users of databases need to connect several of them for\nupdates or comparisons. Much of the work in spatial database management focuses\non matching these spatial databases and more particularly network databases,\nsuch as road networks. With regard to network data, one situation remains\nneglected, that of matching a linear database (with polylines objects) with a\nsurface database (with polygons objects). In any case, users also need to\nconnect these two types of spatial database. In this paper, a case study is\nmade using French examples (Cachan, near Paris), as well as international case\nstudies (Bordeaux in France, Victoria in Canada, and Copenhagen in Denmark), to\npropose an approach intended to make coherent network geographical objects in\ntwo different reference frames (linear and surface). This issue is addressed\nhere through the example of road data. The surface data are then formalized in\norder to adapt them to linear data describing the same geographical objects. In\nthe end, a polygon in the surface data corresponds to a single polyline in the\nlinear data. This consistency should simplify the transfer of information from\none reference frame (linear or surface) to the other. In other words, the\nmethodology developed aims to make linear and surfacegeographic data\ninteroperable.",

    "abstract": "Vehicle Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) act as the core of vehicular communications\nand provide the fundamental wireless communication architecture to support both\nvehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication.\nTherefore, by leveraging only communication technologies, Connected Vehicles\n(CVs) can navigate through the dynamic road network. However, such vehicles are\nstill in their infancy but are expected to have a significant impact on safety\nand mobility such as reducing non-recurrent congestion in case of a vehicle\nbreakdown or other roadway incidents. To evaluate their impacts, this research\nexamines the benefits of having CVs when a vehicle breakdown occurs by\ndeveloping an intelligent proactive re-routing algorithm. Due to a lack of\nreal-world data, this paper adopts an integrated simulated framework consisting\nof a V2X (OMNET++) communication simulator and a traffic microscopic simulator\n(SUMO). The developed algorithm functions such that when a vehicle is broken\ndown within a live traffic lane, the system detects the breakdown, generates\nwarning messages immediately and transmits them to approaching vehicles. Based\non the real-time notification, informed vehicles proactively re-route to\nalternative roads to avoid the breakdown zone. Two scenarios were developed\nwhere a breakdown occurs within and outside a junction for both V2X-enabled and\ndisabled systems. Results show that V2X-enabled CV re-routing mechanism can\nimprove traffic efficiency by reducing congestion and enhance traffic safety by\nsmoothing accelerations and decelerations of affected vehicles with low\ninfrastructure costs.

    "abstract": "Parametric 3D body models like SMPL only represent minimally-clothed people\nand are hard to extend to clothing because they have a fixed mesh topology and\nresolution. To address these limitations, recent work uses implicit surfaces or\npoint clouds to model clothed bodies. While not limited by topology, such\nmethods still struggle to model clothing that deviates significantly from the\nbody, such as skirts and dresses. This is because they rely on the body to\ncanonicalize the clothed surface by reposing it to a reference shape.\nUnfortunately, this process is poorly defined when clothing is far from the\nbody. Additionally, they use linear blend skinning to pose the body and the\nskinning weights are tied to the underlying body parts. In contrast, we model\nthe clothing deformation in a local coordinate space without canonicalization.\nWe also relax the skinning weights to let multiple body parts influence the\nsurface. Specifically, we extend point-based methods with a coarse stage, that\nreplaces canonicalization with a learned pose-independent \"coarse shape\" that\ncan capture the rough surface geometry of clothing like skirts. We then refine\nthis using a network that infers the linear blend skinning weights and pose\ndependent displacements from the coarse representation. The approach works well\nfor garments that both conform to, and deviate from, the body. We demonstrate\nthe usefulness of our approach by learning person-specific avatars from\nexamples and then show how they can be animated in new poses and motions. We\nalso show that the method can learn directly from raw scans with missing data,\ngreatly simplifying the process of creating realistic avatars.

    "title": "Automated detection of pronunciation errors in non-native English speech  employing deep learning",
    "abstract": "Despite significant advances in recent years, the existing Computer-Assisted\nPronunciation Training (CAPT) methods detect pronunciation errors with a\nrelatively low accuracy (precision of 60% at 40%-80% recall). This Ph.D. work\nproposes novel deep learning methods for detecting pronunciation errors in\nnon-native (L2) English speech, outperforming the state-of-the-art method in\nAUC metric (Area under the Curve) by 41%, i.e., from 0.528 to 0.749. One of the\nproblems with existing CAPT methods is the low availability of annotated\nmispronounced speech needed for reliable training of pronunciation error\ndetection models. Therefore, the detection of pronunciation errors is\nreformulated to the task of generating synthetic mispronounced speech.\nIntuitively, if we could mimic mispronounced speech and produce any amount of\ntraining data, detecting pronunciation errors would be more effective.\nFurthermore, to eliminate the need to align canonical and recognized phonemes,\na novel end-to-end multi-task technique to directly detect pronunciation errors\nwas proposed. The pronunciation error detection models have been used at Amazon\nto automatically detect pronunciation errors in synthetic speech to accelerate\nthe research into new speech synthesis methods. It was demonstrated that the\nproposed deep learning methods are applicable in the tasks of detecting and\nreconstructing dysarthric speech.",

The importance sampler uses a cross-entropy method to find\nan optimal Gaussian biasing distribution, and reuses all samples made\nthroughout the process for both, the target probability estimation and for\nupdating the biasing distributions. Large deviation theory is used to find a\ngood initial biasing distribution through the solution of an optimization\nproblem.

This subspace is used for\nthe cross-entropy method, which is known to lose efficiency in higher\ndimensions.

Therefore, this systematic review\nwill review studies that directly measured the articulatory movements of the\ntongue, jaw, and lips following treatment for oral or oropharyngeal cancer.",

The complexity of these systems present\ncomputational challenges for direct application to automatic control. While\nmodel reduction has seen ubiquitous applications in control, the use of\nnonlinear model reduction methods in this setting remains difficult. The\nproblem lies in preserving the structure of the nonlinear dynamics in the\nreduced order model for high-fidelity control.

In this work we have fine-tuned wav2vec 2.0 to\nrecognize and transcribe Bengali speech -- training it on the Bengali Common\nVoice Speech Dataset. After training for 71 epochs, on a training set\nconsisting of 36919 mp3 files, we achieved a training loss of 0.3172 and WER of\n0.2524 on a validation set of size 7,747. Using a 5-gram language model, the\nLevenshtein Distance was 2.6446 on a test set of size 7,747. Then the training\nset and validation set were combined, shuffled and split into 85-15 ratio.\nTraining for 7 more epochs on this combined dataset yielded an improved\nLevenshtein Distance of 2.60753 on the test set.

In an optimization context, SciML-based\ntools have enabled the development of more efficient optimization methods.\nHowever, implementing SciML tools for optimization must be rigorously evaluated\nand performed with caution. This work proposes the deductions of a robustness\ntest that guarantees the robustness of multiobjective SciML-based optimization\nby showing that its results respect the universal approximator theorem. The\ntest is applied in the framework of a novel methodology which is evaluated in a\nseries of benchmarks illustrating its consistency. Moreover, the proposed\nmethodology results are compared with feasible regions of rigorous\noptimization, which requires a significantly higher computational effort.\nHence, this work provides a robustness test for guaranteed robustness in\napplying SciML tools in multiobjective optimization with lower computational\neffort than the existent alternative.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores a new approach to fault-tolerant quantum computing,\nrelying on quantum polar codes. We consider quantum polar codes of\nCalderbank-Shor-Steane type, encoding one logical qubit, which we refer to as\n$\\mathcal{Q}_1$ codes. First, we show that a subfamily of $\\mathcal{Q}_1$ codes\nis equivalent to the well-known family of Shor codes. Moreover, we show that\n$\\mathcal{Q}_1$ codes significantly outperform Shor codes, of the same length\nand minimum distance. Second, we consider the fault-tolerant preparation of\n$\\mathcal{Q}_1$ code states. We give a recursive procedure to prepare a\n$\\mathcal{Q}_1$ code state, based on two-qubit Pauli measurements only. The\nprocedure is not by itself fault-tolerant, however, the measurement operations\ntherein provide redundant classical bits, which can be advantageously used for\nerror detection. Fault tolerance is then achieved by combining the proposed\nrecursive procedure with an error detection method. Finally, we consider the\nfault-tolerant error correction of $\\mathcal{Q}_1$ codes. We use Steane's error\ncorrection technique, which incorporates the proposed fault-tolerant code state\npreparation procedure. We provide numerical estimates of the logical error\nrates for $\\mathcal{Q}_1$ and Shor codes of length $16$ and $64$ qubits,\nassuming a circuit-level depolarizing noise model. Remarkably, the\n$\\mathcal{Q}_1$ code of length $64$ qubits achieves a pseudothreshold value\nslightly below $1\\%$, demonstrating the potential of polar codes for\nfault-tolerant quantum computing.",
