    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the color-plus-mono dual-camera system and propose\nan end-to-end convolutional neural network to align and fuse images from it in\nan efficient and cost-effective way. Our method takes cross-domain and\ncross-scale images as input, and consequently synthesizes HR colorization\nresults to facilitate the trade-off between spatial-temporal resolution and\ncolor depth in the single-camera imaging system. In contrast to the previous\ncolorization methods, ours can adapt to color and monochrome cameras with\ndistinctive spatial-temporal resolutions, rendering the flexibility and\nrobustness in practical applications. The key ingredient of our method is a\ncross-camera alignment module that generates multi-scale correspondences for\ncross-domain image alignment. Through extensive experiments on various datasets\nand multiple settings, we validate the flexibility and effectiveness of our\napproach. Remarkably, our method consistently achieves substantial\nimprovements, i.e., around 10dB PSNR gain, upon the state-of-the-art methods.\nCode is at: https://github.com/IndigoPurple/CCDC",

    "title": "Exploiting Fairness to Enhance Sensitive Attributes Reconstruction",
    "abstract": "In recent years, a growing body of work has emerged on how to learn machine\nlearning models under fairness constraints, often expressed with respect to\nsome sensitive attributes. In this work, we consider the setting in which an\nadversary has black-box access to a target model and show that information\nabout this model's fairness can be exploited by the adversary to enhance his\nreconstruction of the sensitive attributes of the training data. More\nprecisely, we propose a generic reconstruction correction method, which takes\nas input an initial guess made by the adversary and corrects it to comply with\nsome user-defined constraints (such as the fairness information) while\nminimizing the changes in the adversary's guess. The proposed method is\nagnostic to the type of target model, the fairness-aware learning method as\nwell as the auxiliary knowledge of the adversary. To assess the applicability\nof our approach, we have conducted a thorough experimental evaluation on two\nstate-of-the-art fair learning methods, using four different fairness metrics\nwith a wide range of tolerances and with three datasets of diverse sizes and\nsensitive attributes. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed approach to improve the reconstruction of the sensitive attributes\nof the training set.",

    "abstract": "In Novel Class Discovery (NCD), the goal is to find new classes in an\nunlabeled set given a labeled set of known but different classes. While NCD has\nrecently gained attention from the community, no framework has yet been\nproposed for heterogeneous tabular data, despite being a very common\nrepresentation of data. In this paper, we propose TabularNCD, a new method for\ndiscovering novel classes in tabular data. We show a way to extract knowledge\nfrom already known classes to guide the discovery process of novel classes in\nthe context of tabular data which contains heterogeneous variables. A part of\nthis process is done by a new method for defining pseudo labels, and we follow\nrecent findings in Multi-Task Learning to optimize a joint objective function.\nOur method demonstrates that NCD is not only applicable to images but also to\nheterogeneous tabular data. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate our\nmethod and demonstrate its effectiveness against 3 competitors on 7 diverse\npublic classification datasets.",

    "abstract": "Traditional process mining techniques take event data as input where each\nevent is associated with exactly one object. An object represents the\ninstantiation of a process. Object-centric event data contain events associated\nwith multiple objects expressing the interaction of multiple processes. As\ntraditional process mining techniques assume events associated with exactly one\nobject, these techniques cannot be applied to object-centric event data. To use\ntraditional process mining techniques, the object-centric event data are\nflattened by removing all object references but one. The flattening process is\nlossy, leading to inaccurate features extracted from flattened data.\nFurthermore, the graph-like structure of object-centric event data is lost when\nflattening. In this paper, we introduce a general framework for extracting and\nencoding features from object-centric event data. We calculate features\nnatively on the object-centric event data, leading to accurate measures.\nFurthermore, we provide three encodings for these features: tabular,\nsequential, and graph-based. While tabular and sequential encodings have been\nheavily used in process mining, the graph-based encoding is a new technique\npreserving the structure of the object-centric event data. We provide six use\ncases: a visualization and a prediction use case for each of the three\nencodings. We use explainable AI in the prediction use cases to show the\nutility of both the object-centric features and the structure of the sequential\nand graph-based encoding for a predictive model.",

When the matrix departs from\nnormality due only to a low-dimensional invariant subspace, we discuss how\nthese bounds can be adapted to exploit this structure.

This paper extends the state of\nthe art in the latter approach in three key ways: (1) recognizing that students\ncan behave strategically (e.g., reporting grades close to the class average\nwithout doing the work); (2) appropriately handling censored data that arises\nfrom discrete-valued grading rubrics; and (3) using mixed integer programming\nto improve the interpretability of the grades assigned to students.

    "abstract": "Fuzzing has been an important approach for finding bugs and vulnerabilities\nin programs. Many fuzzers deployed in industry run daily and can generate an\noverwhelming number of crashes. Diagnosing such crashes can be very challenging\nand time-consuming. Existing fuzzers typically employ heuristics such as code\ncoverage or call stack hashes to weed out duplicate reporting of bugs. While\nthese heuristics are cheap, they are often imprecise and end up still reporting\nmany \"unique\" crashes corresponding to the same bug. In this paper, we present\nFuzzerAid that uses fault signatures to group crashes reported by the fuzzers.\nFault signature is a small executable program and consists of a selection of\nnecessary statements from the original program that can reproduce a bug. In our\napproach, we first generate a fault signature using a given crash. We then\nexecute the fault signature with other crash inducing inputs. If the failure is\nreproduced, we classify the crashes into the group labeled with the fault\nsignature; if not, we generate a new fault signature. After all the crash\ninducing inputs are classified, we further merge the fault signatures of the\nsame root cause into a group. We implemented our approach in a tool called\nFuzzerAid and evaluated it on 3020 crashes generated from 15 real-world bugs\nand 4 large open source projects. Our evaluation shows that we are able to\ncorrectly group 99.1% of the crashes and reported only 17 (+2) \"unique\" bugs,\noutperforming the state-of-the-art fuzzers.",

To remedy this, we introduce 'object-based\nactive inference' (OBAI), marrying AIF with recent deep object-based neural\nnetworks.

Object representations are endowed with independent action-based\ndynamics. The dynamics and generative model are learned from experience with a\nsimple environment (active multi-dSprites).

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel distributed interval observer design for linear\ntime-invariant (LTI) discrete-time systems subject to bounded disturbances. In\nthe proposed observer algorithm, each agent in a networked group exchanges\nlocally-computed framers or interval-valued state estimates with neighbors, and\ncoordinates its update via an intersection operation. We show that the proposed\nframers are guaranteed to bound the true state trajectory of the system by\nconstruction, i.e., without imposing any additional assumptions or constraints.\nMoreover, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the collective\nstability of the distributed observer, i.e., to guarantee the uniform\nboundedness of the observer error sequence. In particular, we show that such\nconditions can be tractably satisfied through a constructive and distributed\napproach. Moreover, we provide an algorithm to verify some structural\nconditions for a given system, which guarantee the existence of the proposed\nobserver. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nproposed method compared to an existing distributed observer in the literature.",

However, current HE implementations suffer from\nprohibitively high latency. For lattice-based HE to become viable for\nreal-world systems, it is necessary for the key bottlenecks - particularly\npolynomial multiplication - to be highly efficient.\nIn this paper, we present a characterization of GPU-based implementations of\npolynomial multiplication. We begin with a survey of modular reduction\ntechniques and analyze several variants of the widely-used Barrett modular\nreduction algorithm. We then propose a modular reduction variant optimized for\n64-bit integer words on the GPU, obtaining a 1.8x speedup over the existing\ncomparable implementations. Next, we explore the following GPU-specific\nimprovements for polynomial multiplication targeted at optimizing latency and\nthroughput: 1) We present a 2D mixed-radix, multi-block implementation of NTT\nthat results in a 1.85x average speedup over the previous state-of-the-art. 2)\nWe explore shared memory optimizations aimed at reducing redundant memory\naccesses, further improving speedups by 1.2x. 3) Finally, we fuse the Hadamard\nproduct with neighboring stages of the NTT, reducing the twiddle factor memory\nfootprint by 50%.

    "abstract": "Models can expose sensitive information about their training data. In an\nattribute inference attack, an adversary has partial knowledge of some training\nrecords and access to a model trained on those records, and infers the unknown\nvalues of a sensitive feature of those records. We study a fine-grained variant\nof attribute inference we call \\emph{sensitive value inference}, where the\nadversary's goal is to identify with high confidence some records from a\ncandidate set where the unknown attribute has a particular sensitive value. We\nexplicitly compare attribute inference with data imputation that captures the\ntraining distribution statistics, under various assumptions about the training\ndata available to the adversary. Our main conclusions are: (1) previous\nattribute inference methods do not reveal more about the training data from the\nmodel than can be inferred by an adversary without access to the trained model,\nbut with the same knowledge of the underlying distribution as needed to train\nthe attribute inference attack; (2) black-box attribute inference attacks\nrarely learn anything that cannot be learned without the model; but (3)\nwhite-box attacks, which we introduce and evaluate in the paper, can reliably\nidentify some records with the sensitive value attribute that would not be\npredicted without having access to the model. Furthermore, we show that\nproposed defenses such as differentially private training and removing\nvulnerable records from training do not mitigate this privacy risk.

Recently, Transformer models, equipped with attention mechanisms,\nhave exhibited superior performance in various natural language processing\ntasks. However, such methods have not been investigated in polymer sciences.\nHerein, we report TransPolymer, a Transformer-based language model for polymer\nproperty prediction. Owing to our proposed polymer tokenizer with chemical\nawareness, TransPolymer can learn representations directly from polymer\nsequences. The model learns expressive representations by pretraining on a\nlarge unlabeled dataset, followed by finetuning the model on downstream\ndatasets concerning various polymer properties. TransPolymer achieves superior\nperformance in all eight datasets and surpasses other baselines significantly\non most downstream tasks. Moreover, the improvement by the pretrained\nTransPolymer over supervised TransPolymer and other language models strengthens\nthe significant benefits of pretraining on large unlabeled data in\nrepresentation learning.

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning (CL) has shown impressive advances in image\nrepresentation learning in whichever supervised multi-class classification or\nunsupervised learning. However, these CL methods fail to be directly adapted to\nmulti-label image classification due to the difficulty in defining the positive\nand negative instances to contrast a given anchor image in multi-label\nscenario, let the label missing one alone, implying that borrowing a\ncommonly-used way from contrastive multi-class learning to define them will\nincur a lot of false negative instances unfavorable for learning. In this\npaper, with the introduction of a label correction mechanism to identify\nmissing labels, we first elegantly generate positives and negatives for\nindividual semantic labels of an anchor image, then define a unique contrastive\nloss for multi-label image classification with missing labels (CLML), the loss\nis able to accurately bring images close to their true positive images and\nfalse negative images, far away from their true negative images. Different from\nexisting multi-label CL losses, CLML also preserves low-rank global and local\nlabel dependencies in the latent representation space where such dependencies\nhave been shown to be helpful in dealing with missing labels. To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the first general multi-label CL loss in the\nmissing-label scenario and thus can seamlessly be paired with those losses of\nany existing multi-label learning methods just via a single hyperparameter.

As most\nUEware do not have malicious payloads, traditional malware detection approaches\nare ineffective to perform the detection. To address this problem, we propose a\nnovel approach to effectively and efficiently detect UEware by considering the\ntransition orders of the user interfaces (UIs), which determine the usage\nscenarios of these apps. Based on the proposed approach, we design a system\nnamed DeUEDroid to detect the UEware via scene graph. To evaluate DeUEDroid, we\ncollect 26, 591 apps to evaluate DeUEDroid and build up the first large-scale\nground-truth UEware dataset (1, 720 underground economy apps and 831 legitimate\napps). The evaluation result shows that DeUEDroid can construct scene graph\naccurately, and achieve the accuracy scores of 77.70% on the\nfive-classification task (i.e., gambling game, porn, financial scam,\nmiscellaneous, and legitimate apps), reaching obvious improvements over the\nSOTA approaches. Running further on 24, 017 apps, DeUEDroid performs well in\nthe real-world scenario to mitigate the threat. Specifically, by using\nDeUEDroid, we found that UEware are prevalent, i.e., 61% apps in the wild and\n21% apps in the app stores are UEware (with over 72% accuracy after the manual\ninvestigation).

    "abstract": "Over the last few decades, many aspects of human life have been enhanced with\nvirtual domains, from the advent of digital assistants such as Amazon's Alexa\nand Apple's Siri to the latest metaverse efforts of the rebranded Meta. These\ntrends underscore the importance of generating photorealistic visual depictions\nof humans. This has led to the rapid growth of so-called deepfake and talking\nhead generation methods in recent years. Despite their impressive results and\npopularity, they usually lack certain qualitative aspects such as texture\nquality, lips synchronization, or resolution, and practical aspects such as the\nability to run in real-time. To allow for virtual human avatars to be used in\npractical scenarios, we propose an end-to-end framework for synthesizing\nhigh-quality virtual human faces capable of speech with a special emphasis on\nperformance. We introduce a novel network utilizing visemes as an intermediate\naudio representation and a novel data augmentation strategy employing a\nhierarchical image synthesis approach that allows disentanglement of the\ndifferent modalities used to control the global head motion. Our method runs in\nreal-time, and is able to deliver superior results compared to the current\nstate-of-the-art.",

    "title": "Deep Stable Representation Learning on Electronic Health Records",
    "abstract": "Deep learning models have achieved promising disease prediction performance\nof the Electronic Health Records (EHR) of patients. However, most models\ndeveloped under the I.I.D. hypothesis fail to consider the agnostic\ndistribution shifts, diminishing the generalization ability of deep learning\nmodels to Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data. In this setting, spurious statistical\ncorrelations that may change in different environments will be exploited, which\ncan cause sub-optimal performances of deep learning models. The unstable\ncorrelation between procedures and diagnoses existed in the training\ndistribution can cause spurious correlation between historical EHR and future\ndiagnosis. To address this problem, we propose to use a causal representation\nlearning method called Causal Healthcare Embedding (CHE). CHE aims at\neliminating the spurious statistical relationship by removing the dependencies\nbetween diagnoses and procedures. We introduce the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence\nCriterion (HSIC) to measure the degree of independence between the embedded\ndiagnosis and procedure features. Based on causal view analyses, we perform the\nsample weighting technique to get rid of such spurious relationship for the\nstable learning of EHR across different environments. Moreover, our proposed\nCHE method can be used as a flexible plug-and-play module that can enhance\nexisting deep learning models on EHR. Extensive experiments on two public\ndatasets and five state-of-the-art baselines unequivocally show that CHE can\nimprove the prediction accuracy of deep learning models on out-of-distribution\ndata by a large margin. In addition, the interpretability study shows that CHE\ncould successfully leverage causal structures to reflect a more reasonable\ncontribution of historical records for predictions.",

In this scheme, when a\nsteganalysis model is trained on the new image dataset generated by the new\nsteganographic algorithm, its network parameters are effectively and\nefficiently updated with sufficient consideration of their importance evaluated\nin the previous training process.

    "abstract": "Few-Shot Learning (FSL) has attracted growing attention in computer vision\ndue to its capability in model training without the need for excessive data.\nFSL is challenging because the training and testing categories (the base vs.\nnovel sets) can be largely diversified. Conventional transfer-based solutions\nthat aim to transfer knowledge learned from large labeled training sets to\ntarget testing sets are limited, as critical adverse impacts of the shift in\ntask distribution are not adequately addressed. In this paper, we extend the\nsolution of transfer-based methods by incorporating the concept of\nmetric-learning and channel attention. To better exploit the feature\nrepresentations extracted by the feature backbone, we propose Class-Specific\nChannel Attention (CSCA) module, which learns to highlight the discriminative\nchannels in each class by assigning each class one CSCA weight vector. Unlike\ngeneral attention modules designed to learn global-class features, the CSCA\nmodule aims to learn local and class-specific features with very effective\ncomputation. We evaluated the performance of the CSCA module on standard\nbenchmarks including miniImagenet, Tiered-ImageNet, CIFAR-FS, and CUB-200-2011.\nExperiments are performed in inductive and in/cross-domain settings.

The SVSM protocol is mainly based on the padding\nand sampling based frequency oracle (PSFO) protocol, and regarded an itemset as\nan independent item without considering the frequency consistency among\nitemsets.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel LDP approach to FIM called LDP-FPMiner\nbased on frequent pattern tree (FP-tree). Our proposal exploits frequency\nconsistency among itemsets by constructing and optimizing a noisy FP-tree with\nLDP. Specifically, it works as follows. First, the most frequent items are\nidentified, and the item domain is cut down accordingly. Second, the maximum\nlevel of the FP-tree is estimated.

As\nhousehold appliances are the primary energy consumers, their recognition\nbecomes crucial to avoid unattended usage, thereby conserving energy and making\nsmart environments more sustainable.

Nevertheless, the existing\ncontrastive learning-based methods fail to ensure that the positive (or\nnegative) sequence obtained by some random augmentation (or sequence sampling)\non a given anchor user sequence remains to be semantically similar (or\ndifferent). When the positive and negative sequences turn out to be false\npositive and false negative respectively, it may lead to degraded\nrecommendation performance. In this work, we address the above problem by\nproposing Explanation Guided Augmentations (EGA) and Explanation Guided\nContrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation (EC4SRec) model framework.\nThe key idea behind EGA is to utilize explanation method(s) to determine items'\nimportance in a user sequence and derive the positive and negative sequences\naccordingly. EC4SRec then combines both self-supervised and supervised\ncontrastive learning over the positive and negative sequences generated by EGA\noperations to improve sequence representation learning for more accurate\nrecommendation results.

Moreover, the proof can be extended to show the following\nsecretive (1) and extra (2) versions: (1) for n agents with monotone\nvaluations, the path can be divided into n connected bundles such that an EF1\nassignment of the remaining bundles can be made to the other agents for any\nselection made by the secretive agent; (2) for n+1 agents with monotone\nvaluations, the path can be divided into n connected bundles such that when any\nextra agent leaves, an EF1 assignment of the bundles can be made to the\nremaining agents.",

    "abstract": "Twenty-two years after the advent of the first-generation vehicular network,\ni.e., dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) standard/IEEE 802.11p, the\nvehicular technology market has become very competitive with a new player,\nCellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X). Currently, C-V2X technology likely\ndominates the race because of the big advantages of comprehensive coverage and\nhigh throughput/reliability. Meanwhile, DSRC-based technologies are struggling\nto survive and rebound with many hopes betting on the success of the\nsecond-generation standard, IEEE P802.11bd. While the standards battle to\nattract automotive makers and dominate the commercial market landing, the\nresearch community has started thinking about the shape of the next-generation\nvehicular networks. This article details the state-of-the-art progress of\nvehicular networks, particularly the cellular V2X-related technologies in\nspecific use cases, compared to the features of the current generation. Through\nthe typical examples, we also highlight why 5G is inadequate to provide the\nbest connectivity for vehicular applications, and then 6G technologies can fill\nup the vacancy.",

    "abstract": "The task of link prediction aims to solve the problem of incomplete knowledge\ncaused by the difficulty of collecting facts from the real world. GCNs-based\nmodels are widely applied to solve link prediction problems due to their\nsophistication, but GCNs-based models are suffering from two problems in the\nstructure and training process. 1) The transformation methods of GCN layers\nbecome increasingly complex in GCN-based knowledge representation models; 2)\nDue to the incompleteness of the knowledge graph collection process, there are\nmany uncollected true facts in the labeled negative samples. Therefore, this\npaper investigates the characteristic of the information aggregation\ncoefficient (self-attention) of adjacent nodes and redesigns the self-attention\nmechanism of the GAT structure.

Specifically, we first introduce a data splitting method to create\ncompositional splits from existing MWP datasets. Meanwhile, we synthesize data\nto isolate the effect of compositions. To improve the compositional\ngeneralization in MWP solving, we propose an iterative data augmentation method\nthat includes diverse compositional variation into training data and could\ncollaborate with MWP methods. During the evaluation, we examine a set of\nmethods and find all of them encounter severe performance loss on the evaluated\ndatasets.

This work considers\nvehicular fog computing scenarios where the clients of computation offloading\nservices try to minimize their own costs while deciding which VFNs to offload\ntheir tasks. We focus on decentralized multi-agent decision-making in a\nrepeated unknown game where each agent, e.g., service client, can observe only\nits own action and realized cost. In other words, each agent is unaware of the\ngame composition or even the existence of opponents. We apply a completely\nuncoupled learning rule to generalize the decentralized decision-making\nalgorithm presented in \\cite{Cho2021} for the multi-agent case. The multi-agent\nsolution proposed in this work can capture the unknown offloading cost\nvariations susceptive to resource congestion under an adversarial framework\nwhere each agent may take implicit cost estimation and suitable resource choice\nadapting to the dynamics associated with volatile supply and demand. According\nto the evaluation via simulation, this work reveals that such individual\nperturbations for robustness to uncertainty and adaptation to dynamicity ensure\na certain level of optimality in terms of social welfare, e.g., converging the\nactual sequence of play with unknown and asymmetric attributes and lowering the\ncorrespondent cost in social welfare due to the self-interested behaviors of\nagents.",

To do so, DNNs should preferably be trained using large\nlabeled data sets with a similar statistical relationship as the one under\nwhich they are to infer. For DNN-aided receivers, obtaining labeled data\nconventionally involves pilot signalling at the cost of reduced spectral\nefficiency, typically resulting in access to limited data sets. In this paper,\nwe study how one can enrich a small set of labeled pilots data into a larger\ndata set for training deep receivers. Motivated by the widespread use of data\naugmentation techniques for enriching visual and text data, we propose\ndedicated augmentation schemes that exploits the characteristics of digital\ncommunication data. We identify the key considerations in data augmentations\nfor deep receivers as the need for domain orientation, class (constellation)\ndiversity, and low complexity. Following these guidelines, we devise three\ncomplementing augmentations that exploit the geometric properties of digital\nconstellations. Our combined augmentation approach builds on the merits of\nthese different augmentations to synthesize reliable data from a momentary\nchannel distribution, to be used for training deep receivers.

Furthermore, the results of the influence\nprocesses may also depend on how similar the interacting individuals are in\nterms of their features. This paper addresses this issue and elaborates on an\nagent-based model that is sensitive to the individual characteristics, both\nopinion and non-opinion ones. The model is fortified with a ranking algorithm\nthat mimics the ranking algorithms widely adopted in real-world online social\nnetworks. For the resulting model, I elaborate a mean-field approximation that\ndescribes the behavior of the model at the macroscopic level via an autonomous\nsystem of ordinary differential equations. The properties of this system are\nthoroughly studied.",

    "abstract": "Several training strategies and temporal models have been recently proposed\nfor isolated word lip-reading in a series of independent works. However, the\npotential of combining the best strategies and investigating the impact of each\nof them has not been explored. In this paper, we systematically investigate the\nperformance of state-of-the-art data augmentation approaches, temporal models\nand other training strategies, like self-distillation and using word boundary\nindicators. Our results show that Time Masking (TM) is the most important\naugmentation followed by mixup and Densely-Connected Temporal Convolutional\nNetworks (DC-TCN) are the best temporal model for lip-reading of isolated\nwords. Using self-distillation and word boundary indicators is also beneficial\nbut to a lesser extent. A combination of all the above methods results in a\nclassification accuracy of 93.4%, which is an absolute improvement of 4.6% over\nthe current state-of-the-art performance on the LRW dataset. The performance\ncan be further improved to 94.1% by pre-training on additional datasets. An\nerror analysis of the various training strategies reveals that the performance\nimproves by increasing the classification accuracy of hard-to-recognise words.",

Existing\nliterature on top-k optimization generally focuses on the optimization method\nof the top-k objective, while ignoring the limitations of the metric itself. In\nthis paper, we point out that the top-k objective lacks enough discrimination\nsuch that the induced predictions may give a totally irrelevant label a top\nrank. To fix this issue, we develop a novel metric named partial Area Under the\ntop-k Curve (AUTKC). Theoretical analysis shows that AUTKC has a better\ndiscrimination ability, and its Bayes optimal score function could give a\ncorrect top-K ranking with respect to the conditional probability. This shows\nthat AUTKC does not allow irrelevant labels to appear in the top list.\nFurthermore, we present an empirical surrogate risk minimization framework to\noptimize the proposed metric. Theoretically, we present (1) a sufficient\ncondition for Fisher consistency of the Bayes optimal score function; (2) a\ngeneralization upper bound which is insensitive to the number of classes under\na simple hyperparameter setting.

Miscellaneous research\nefforts have been approached the problem of detecting anomalous human driver\nbehaviour to examine the frontal face of the driver and automobile dynamics via\ncomputer vision techniques.

    "abstract": "Existing Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) mainly operate on local convolutions\nwith binarization function. However, such simple bit operations lack the\nability of modeling contextual dependencies, which is critical for learning\ndiscriminative deep representations in vision models. In this work, we tackle\nthis issue by presenting new designs of binary neural modules, which enables\nBNNs to learn effective contextual dependencies. First, we propose a binary\nmulti-layer perceptron (MLP) block as an alternative to binary convolution\nblocks to directly model contextual dependencies. Both short-range and\nlong-range feature dependencies are modeled by binary MLPs, where the former\nprovides local inductive bias and the latter breaks limited receptive field in\nbinary convolutions. Second, to improve the robustness of binary models with\ncontextual dependencies, we compute the contextual dynamic embeddings to\ndetermine the binarization thresholds in general binary convolutional blocks.\nArmed with our binary MLP blocks and improved binary convolution, we build the\nBNNs with explicit Contextual Dependency modeling, termed as BCDNet. On the\nstandard ImageNet-1K classification benchmark, the BCDNet achieves 72.3% Top-1\naccuracy and outperforms leading binary methods by a large margin. In\nparticular, the proposed BCDNet exceeds the state-of-the-art ReActNet-A by 2.9%\nTop-1 accuracy with similar operations. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/Sense-GVT/BCDN",

Federated learning is an\nemerging paradigm that provides privacy-preserving collaboration among multiple\nparticipants for model training without sharing private and limited data. The\nnoisy labels in the datasets of the participants degrade the performance and\nincrease the number of communication rounds for convergence of federated\nlearning.

The approach first estimates the noise ratio of the dataset for\neach participant and normalizes the noise ratio using the server dataset. The\nproposed approach can handle bias in the server dataset and minimizes its\nimpact on the participants' dataset. Next, we calculate the optimal weighted\ncontributions of the participants using the normalized noise ratio and\ninfluence of each participant. We further derive the expression to estimate the\nnumber of communication rounds required for the convergence of the proposed\napproach.

    "abstract": "Embodied agents are regularly faced with the challenge to learn new tasks. In\norder to do that they need to be able to predict their next sensory state by\nforming an internal world model. We theorize that agents require a high value\nof information integration to update that world model in light of new\ninformation. This can be seen in the context of Integrated Information Theory,\nwhich provides a quantitative approach to consciousness and can be applied to\nneural networks. We use the sensorimotor loop to model the interactions among\nthe agent's brain, body and environment. Thereby we can calculate various\ninformation theoretic measures that quantify different information flows in the\nsystem, one of which corresponds to Integrated Information. Additionally we are\nable to measure the interaction among the body and the environment, which leads\nto the concept of Morphological Computation. Previous research reveals an\nantagonistic relationship between Integrated Information and Morphological\nComputation. A morphology adapted well to a task can reduce the necessity for\nIntegrated Information significantly. This creates the problem that embodied\nintelligence is correlated with reduced conscious experience. Here we propose a\nsolution to this problem, namely that the agents need Integrated Information to\nlearn.

This\nburden can be partially decreased by using discrete models, however even then\nthe practical application is limited to relatively small material volumes.\nThis paper formulates a homogenization scheme for discrete diffusion models.\nAsymptotic expansion homogenization is applied to distinguish between (i) the\ncontinuous macroscale description approximated by the standard finite element\nmethod and (ii) the fully resolved discrete mesoscale description in a local\nrepresentative volume element (RVE) of material. Both transient and\nsteady-state variants with nonlinear constitutive relations are discussed. In\nall the cases, the resulting discrete RVE problem becomes a simple linear\nsteady-state problem that can be easily pre-computed. The scale separation\nprovides a significant reduction of computational time allowing the solution of\npractical problems with a negligible error introduced mainly by the finite\nelement discretization at the macroscale.",

To tackle this, we derive\ninspiration from the human visual system which contains specialized regions in\nthe brain that are dedicated towards handling specific tasks. We design a novel\nDynamic Spatio-Temporal Specialization (DSTS) module, which consists of\nspecialized neurons that are only activated for a subset of samples that are\nhighly similar. During training, the loss forces the specialized neurons to\nlearn discriminative fine-grained differences to distinguish between these\nsimilar samples, improving fine-grained recognition. Moreover, a\nspatio-temporal specialization method further optimizes the architectures of\nthe specialized neurons to capture either more spatial or temporal fine-grained\ninformation, to better tackle the large range of spatio-temporal variations in\nthe videos. Lastly, we design an Upstream-Downstream Learning algorithm to\noptimize our model's dynamic decisions during training, improving the\nperformance of our DSTS module.

    "abstract": "We present a simple yet effective self-training approach, named as STAD, for\nlow-resource relation extraction. The approach first classifies the\nauto-annotated instances into two groups: confident instances and uncertain\ninstances, according to the probabilities predicted by a teacher model. In\ncontrast to most previous studies, which mainly only use the confident\ninstances for self-training, we make use of the uncertain instances. To this\nend, we propose a method to identify ambiguous but useful instances from the\nuncertain instances and then divide the relations into candidate-label set and\nnegative-label set for each ambiguous instance. Next, we propose a set-negative\ntraining method on the negative-label sets for the ambiguous instances and a\npositive training method for the confident instances. Finally, a joint-training\nmethod is proposed to build the final relation extraction system on all data.\nExperimental results on two widely used datasets SemEval2010 Task-8 and\nRe-TACRED with low-resource settings demonstrate that this new self-training\napproach indeed achieves significant and consistent improvements when comparing\nto several competitive self-training systems.

However, it still remains under-explored to detect phishing URLs with\nevasion, i.e., phishing URLs that pretend to be benign by manipulating\npatterns. In many cases, the attacker i) reuses prepared phishing web pages\nbecause making a completely brand-new set costs non-trivial expenses, ii)\nprefers hosting companies that do not require private information and are\ncheaper than others, iii) prefers shared hosting for cost efficiency, and iv)\nsometimes uses benign domains, IP addresses, and URL string patterns to evade\nexisting detection methods. Inspired by those behavioral characteristics, we\npresent a network-based inference method to accurately detect phishing URLs\ncamouflaged with legitimate patterns, i.e., robust to evasion.

From such a network perspective,\nanalysis of the DAG-based blockchain systems becomes interesting but difficult\nand challenging. So, the simulation models are adopted widely. In this paper,\nwe first describe a simple Markov model for the DAG-based blockchain with IOTA\nTangle by means of two layers of tips and internal tips' impatient connection\nbehavior. Then we set up a continuous-time Markov process to analyze the\nDAG-based blockchain system and show that this Markov process is a\nlevel-dependent quasi-birth-and-death (QBD) process. Based on this, we prove\nthat the QBD process must be irreducible and positive recurrent. Furthermore,\nonce the stationary probability vector of the QBD process is given, we provide\nperformance analysis of the DAG-based blockchain system. Nextly, we propose a\nnew effective method for computing the average sojourn time of any arriving\ninternal tip at this system by means of the first passage times and the PH\ndistributions. Finally, we use numerical examples to check the validity of our\ntheoretical results and indicate how some key system parameters influence the\nperformance measures of this system.

However, classical frameworks of privacy (e.g., differential\nprivacy (DP)) have overlooked the impact of data freshness on privacy\nguarantees, which may lead to unnecessary accuracy loss when trying to achieve\nmeaningful privacy guarantees in time-varying databases. In this work, we\nintroduce \\textit{age-dependent DP}, taking into account the underlying\nstochastic nature of a time-varying database. In this new framework, we\nestablish a connection between classical DP and age-dependent DP, based on\nwhich we characterize the impact of data staleness and temporal correlation on\nprivacy guarantees. Our characterization demonstrates that \\textit{aging},\ni.e., using stale data inputs and/or postponing the release of outputs, can be\na new strategy to protect data privacy in addition to noise injection in the\ntraditional DP framework. Furthermore, to generalize our results to a\nmulti-query scenario, we present a sequential composition result for\nage-dependent DP under any publishing and aging policies. We then characterize\nthe optimal tradeoffs between privacy risk and utility and show how this can be\nachieved. Finally, case studies show that to achieve a target of an arbitrarily\nsmall privacy risk in a single-query case, combing aging and noise injection\nonly leads to a bounded accuracy loss, whereas using noise injection only (as\nin the benchmark case of DP) will lead to an unbounded accuracy loss.",

Contrastive methods are a\npopular choice for self-supervision in the audio domain, and typically provide\na learning signal by forcing the model to be invariant to some transformations\nof the input. These methods, however, require measures such as negative\nsampling or some form of regularisation to be taken to prevent the model from\ncollapsing on trivial solutions.

Our\nexperiments show that it is possible to learn meaningful representations for\ntempo estimation by solely relying on equivariant self-supervision, achieving\nperformance comparable with supervised methods on several benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Tracking control has been a vital research topic in robotics. This paper\npresents a novel hybrid control strategy for an unmanned underwater vehicle\n(UUV) based on a bioinspired neural dynamics model. An enhanced backstepping\nkinematic control strategy is first developed to avoid sharp velocity jumps and\nprovides smooth velocity commands relative to conventional methods. Then, a\nnovel sliding mode control is proposed, which is capable of providing smooth\nand continuous torque commands free from chattering. In comparative studies,\nthe proposed combined hybrid control strategy has ensured control signals\nsmoothness, which is critical in real world applications, especially for an\nunmanned underwater vehicle that needs to operate in complex underwater\nenvironments.",

    "abstract": "The distributed computation of a Nash equilibrium in aggregative games is\ngaining increased traction in recent years. Of particular interest is the\nmediator-free scenario where individual players only access or observe the\ndecisions of their neighbors due to practical constraints. Given the\ncompetitive rivalry among participating players, protecting the privacy of\nindividual players becomes imperative when sensitive information is involved.\nWe propose a fully distributed equilibrium-computation approach for aggregative\ngames that can achieve both rigorous differential privacy and guaranteed\ncomputation accuracy of the Nash equilibrium. This is in sharp contrast to\nexisting differential-privacy solutions for aggregative games that have to\neither sacrifice the accuracy of equilibrium computation to gain rigorous\nprivacy guarantees, or allow the cumulative privacy budget to grow unbounded,\nhence losing privacy guarantees, as iteration proceeds. Our approach uses\nindependent noises across players, thus making it effective even when\nadversaries have access to all shared messages as well as the underlying\nalgorithm structure. The encryption-free nature of the proposed approach, also\nensures efficiency in computation and communication. The approach is also\napplicable in stochastic aggregative games, able to ensure both rigorous\ndifferential privacy and guaranteed computation accuracy of the Nash\nequilibrium when individual players only have stochastic estimates of their\npseudo-gradient mappings. Numerical comparisons with existing counterparts\nconfirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

    "abstract": "Modeling sequential patterns from data is at the core of various time series\nforecasting tasks. Deep learning models have greatly outperformed many\ntraditional models, but these black-box models generally lack explainability in\nprediction and decision making. To reveal the underlying trend with\nunderstandable mathematical expressions, scientists and economists tend to use\npartial differential equations (PDEs) to explain the highly nonlinear dynamics\nof sequential patterns. However, it usually requires domain expert knowledge\nand a series of simplified assumptions, which is not always practical and can\ndeviate from the ever-changing world. Is it possible to learn the differential\nrelations from data dynamically to explain the time-evolving dynamics? In this\nwork, we propose an learning framework that can automatically obtain\ninterpretable PDE models from sequential data. Particularly, this framework is\ncomprised of learnable differential blocks, named $P$-blocks, which is proved\nto be able to approximate any time-evolving complex continuous functions in\ntheory. Moreover, to capture the dynamics shift, this framework introduces a\nmeta-learning controller to dynamically optimize the hyper-parameters of a\nhybrid PDE model. Extensive experiments on times series forecasting of\nfinancial, engineering, and health data show that our model can provide\nvaluable interpretability and achieve comparable performance to\nstate-of-the-art models. From empirical studies, we find that learning a few\ndifferential operators may capture the major trend of sequential dynamics\nwithout massive computational complexity.",

Most existing algorithms assume that the\nunderlying task distribution is stationary. Here we consider a more realistic\nand challenging setting in that task distributions evolve over time. We name\nthis problem as Semi-supervised meta-learning with Evolving Task diStributions,\nabbreviated as SETS. Two key challenges arise in this more realistic setting:\n(i) how to use unlabeled data in the presence of a large amount of unlabeled\nout-of-distribution (OOD) data; and (ii) how to prevent catastrophic forgetting\non previously learned task distributions due to the task distribution shift. We\npropose an OOD Robust and knowleDge presErved semi-supeRvised meta-learning\napproach (ORDER), to tackle these two major challenges. Specifically, our ORDER\nintroduces a novel mutual information regularization to robustify the model\nwith unlabeled OOD data and adopts an optimal transport regularization to\nremember previously learned knowledge in feature space. In addition, we test\nour method on a very challenging dataset: SETS on large-scale non-stationary\nsemi-supervised task distributions consisting of (at least) 72K tasks.

This impedes the widespread use of BCIs.\nTo ensure practicality, we propose a highly novel target identification method\nbased on an ensemble of deep neural networks (DNNs), which does not require any\nsort of user-specific training. Method: We exploit already-existing literature\ndatasets from participants of previously conducted EEG experiments to train a\nglobal target identifier DNN first, which is then fine-tuned to each\nparticipant. We transfer this ensemble of fine-tuned DNNs to the new user\ninstance, determine the k most representative DNNs according to the\nparticipants' statistical similarities to the new user, and predict the target\ncharacter through a weighted combination of the ensemble predictions.

Although efforts have been\nreported to address these two tasks, most of them rely on hand-crafted features\nand there is no attempt to exploit the two prediction tasks simultaneously. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel task-aware contrastive learning algorithm to\njointly predict meningioma grade and brain invasion from multi-modal MRIs.\nBased on the basic multi-task learning framework, our key idea is to adopt\ncontrastive learning strategy to disentangle the image features into\ntask-specific features and task-common features, and explicitly leverage their\ninherent connections to improve feature representation for the two prediction\ntasks. In this retrospective study, an MRI dataset was collected, for which 800\npatients (containing 148 high-grade, 62 invasion) were diagnosed with\nmeningioma by pathological analysis.

SISR employs a\ndeep symbolic regression approach, using a multi-layer LSTM-RNN with mutation\nto probabilistically sample Hamiltonian symbolic expressions. Using symplectic\nneural networks, we develop a model-agnostic approach for extracting meaningful\nphysical priors from the data that can be imposed on-the-fly into the RNN\noutput, limiting its search space. Hamiltonians generated by the RNN are\noptimized and assessed using a fourth-order symplectic integration scheme;\nprediction performance is used to train the LSTM-RNN to generate increasingly\nbetter functions via a risk-seeking policy gradients approach.

    "abstract": "User review data is helpful in alleviating the data sparsity problem in many\nrecommender systems. In review-based recommendation methods, review data is\nconsidered as auxiliary information that can improve the quality of learned\nuser/item or interaction representations for the user rating prediction task.\nHowever, these methods usually model user-item interactions in a holistic\nmanner and neglect the entanglement of the latent factors behind them, e.g.,\nprice, quality, or appearance, resulting in suboptimal representations and\nreducing interpretability. In this paper, we propose a Disentangled Graph\nContrastive Learning framework for Review-based recommendation (DGCLR), to\nseparately model the user-item interactions based on different latent factors\nthrough the textual review data. To this end, we first model the distributions\nof interactions over latent factors from both semantic information in review\ndata and structural information in user-item graph data, forming several factor\ngraphs. Then a factorized message passing mechanism is designed to learn\ndisentangled user/item representations on the factor graphs, which enable us to\nfurther characterize the interactions and adaptively combine the predicted\nratings from multiple factors via a devised attention mechanism. Finally, we\nset two factor-wise contrastive learning objectives to alleviate the sparsity\nissue and model the user/item and interaction features pertinent to each factor\nmore accurately. Empirical results over five benchmark datasets validate the\nsuperiority of DGCLR over the state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis is\noffered to interpret the learned intent factors and rating prediction in DGCLR.",

To mitigate this issue, we\npropose two methods, language embedding embodiment and language-aware\nmulti-head attention, to learn informative language representations to channel\ntranslation into right directions.

Experiment results on two\ndatasets for massively multilingual neural machine translation demonstrate that\nlanguage-aware multi-head attention benefits both supervised and zero-shot\ntranslation and significantly alleviates the off-target translation issue.\nFurther linguistic typology prediction experiments show that matrix-based\nlanguage representations learned by our methods are capable of capturing rich\nlinguistic typology features.",

However, simply replaying the entire\nrecording is not necessary given the high redundancy of driving scenes in a\nrecording (e.g., keeping the same lane for 10 minutes on a highway). In this\npaper, we propose a novel test reduction and prioritization approach for\nmulti-module ADS. First, our approach automatically encodes frames in a driving\nrecording to feature vectors based on a driving scene schema. Then, the given\nrecording is sliced into segments based on the similarity of consecutive\nvectors. Lengthy segments are truncated to reduce the length of a recording and\nredundant segments with the same vector are removed. The remaining segments are\nprioritized based on both the coverage and the rarity of driving scenes. We\nimplemented this approach on an industry level, multi-module ADS called Apollo\nand evaluated it on three road maps in various regression settings. The results\nshow that our approach significantly reduced the original recordings by over\n34% while keeping comparable test effectiveness, identifying almost all\ninjected faults.

    "title": "Autonomous Cross Domain Adaptation under Extreme Label Scarcity",
    "abstract": "A cross domain multistream classification is a challenging problem calling\nfor fast domain adaptations to handle different but related streams in\nnever-ending and rapidly changing environments. Notwithstanding that existing\nmultistream classifiers assume no labelled samples in the target stream, they\nstill incur expensive labelling cost since they require fully labelled samples\nof the source stream. This paper aims to attack the problem of extreme label\nshortage in the cross domain multistream classification problems where only\nvery few labelled samples of the source stream are provided before process\nruns. Our solution, namely Learning Streaming Process from Partial Ground Truth\n(LEOPARD), is built upon a flexible deep clustering network where its hidden\nnodes, layers and clusters are added and removed dynamically in respect to\nvarying data distributions. A deep clustering strategy is underpinned by a\nsimultaneous feature learning and clustering technique leading to\nclustering-friendly latent spaces. A domain adaptation strategy relies on the\nadversarial domain adaptation technique where a feature extractor is trained to\nfool a domain classifier classifying source and target streams. Our numerical\nstudy demonstrates the efficacy of LEOPARD where it delivers improved\nperformances compared to prominent algorithms in 15 of 24 cases.

    "title": "The Broken Windows Theory Applies to Technical Debt",
    "abstract": "Context: The term technical debt (TD) describes the aggregation of\nsub-optimal solutions that serve to impede the evolution and maintenance of a\nsystem. Some claim that the broken windows theory (BWT), a concept borrowed\nfrom criminology, also applies to software development projects. The theory\nstates that the presence of indications of previous crime (such as a broken\nwindow) will increase the likelihood of further criminal activity; TD could be\nconsidered the broken windows of software systems. Objective: To empirically\ninvestigate the causal relationship between the TD density of a system and the\npropensity of developers to introduce new TD during the extension of that\nsystem. Method: The study used a mixed-methods research strategy consisting of\na controlled experiment with an accompanying survey and follow-up interviews.\nThe experiment had a total of 29 developers of varying experience levels\ncompleting a system extension tasks in an already existing systems with high or\nlow TD density. The solutions were scanned for TD. Six subjects participated in\nfollow-up interviews, where the results were analyzed using thematic analysis.\nResult: The analysis revealed significant effects of TD level on the subjects'\ntendency to re-implement (rather than reuse) functionality, choose\nnon-descriptive variable names, and introduce other code smells, all with at\nleast 95% credible intervals. Additionally, the developers appeared to be, at\nleast partially, aware of when they had introduced TD. Conclusion: Three\nseparate significant results along with a validating qualitative result combine\nto form substantial evidence of the BWT's applicability to software engineering\ncontexts. Existing TD has a major impact on developers propensity to introduce\nnew TD of various types during development. While mimicry seems to be part of\nthe explanation it can not alone describe the observed effects.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the backbone for a myriad of tasks\npertaining to graphs and similar topological data structures. While many works\nhave been established in domains related to node and graph\nclassification/regression tasks, they mostly deal with a single task. Continual\nlearning on graphs is largely unexplored and existing graph continual learning\napproaches are limited to the task-incremental learning scenarios. This paper\nproposes a graph continual learning strategy that combines the\narchitecture-based and memory-based approaches. The structural learning\nstrategy is driven by reinforcement learning, where a controller network is\ntrained in such a way to determine an optimal number of nodes to be\nadded/pruned from the base network when new tasks are observed, thus assuring\nsufficient network capacities. The parameter learning strategy is underpinned\nby the concept of Dark Experience replay method to cope with the catastrophic\nforgetting problem. Our approach is numerically validated with several graph\ncontinual learning benchmark problems in both task-incremental learning and\nclass-incremental learning settings. Compared to recently published works, our\napproach demonstrates improved performance in both the settings. The\nimplementation code can be found at \\url{https://github.com/codexhammer/gcl}.",

    "abstract": "Next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is a critical task in\nlocation-based social networks, yet remains challenging due to a high degree of\nvariation and personalization exhibited in user movements. In this work, we\nexplore the latent hierarchical structure composed of multi-granularity\nshort-term structural patterns in user check-in sequences. We propose a\nSpatio-Temporal context AggRegated Hierarchical Transformer (STAR-HiT) for next\nPOI recommendation, which employs stacked hierarchical encoders to recursively\nencode the spatio-temporal context and explicitly locate subsequences of\ndifferent granularities. More specifically, in each encoder, the global\nattention layer captures the spatio-temporal context of the sequence, while the\nlocal attention layer performed within each subsequence enhances subsequence\nmodeling using the local context. The sequence partition layer infers positions\nand lengths of subsequences from the global context adaptively, such that\nsemantics in subsequences can be well preserved. Finally, the subsequence\naggregation layer fuses representations within each subsequence to form the\ncorresponding subsequence representation, thereby generating a new sequence of\nhigher-level granularity. The stacking of encoders captures the latent\nhierarchical structure of the check-in sequence, which is used to predict the\nnext visiting POI. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate\nthat the proposed model achieves superior performance whilst providing\nexplanations for recommendations.

    "abstract": "Data augmentation techniques are widely used in text classification tasks to\nimprove the performance of classifiers, especially in low-resource scenarios.\nMost previous methods conduct text augmentation without considering the\ndifferent functionalities of the words in the text, which may generate\nunsatisfactory samples. Different words may play different roles in text\nclassification, which inspires us to strategically select the proper roles for\ntext augmentation. In this work, we first identify the relationships between\nthe words in a text and the text category from the perspectives of statistical\ncorrelation and semantic similarity and then utilize them to divide the words\ninto four roles -- Gold, Venture, Bonus, and Trivial words, which have\ndifferent functionalities for text classification. Based on these word roles,\nwe present a new augmentation technique called STA (Selective Text\nAugmentation) where different text-editing operations are selectively applied\nto words with specific roles. STA can generate diverse and relatively clean\nsamples, while preserving the original core semantics, and is also quite simple\nto implement. Extensive experiments on 5 benchmark low-resource text\nclassification datasets illustrate that augmented samples produced by STA\nsuccessfully boost the performance of classification models which significantly\noutperforms previous non-selective methods, including two large language\nmodel-based techniques. Cross-dataset experiments further indicate that STA can\nhelp the classifiers generalize better to other datasets than previous methods.",

    "abstract": "In the existing methods, LiDAR odometry shows superior performance, but\nvisual odometry is still widely used for its price advantage. Conventionally,\nthe task of visual odometry mainly rely on the input of continuous images.\nHowever, it is very complicated for the odometry network to learn the epipolar\ngeometry information provided by the images. In this paper, the concept of\npseudo-LiDAR is introduced into the odometry to solve this problem. The\npseudo-LiDAR point cloud back-projects the depth map generated by the image\ninto the 3D point cloud, which changes the way of image representation.\nCompared with the stereo images, the pseudo-LiDAR point cloud generated by the\nstereo matching network can get the explicit 3D coordinates. Since the 6\nDegrees of Freedom (DoF) pose transformation occurs in 3D space, the 3D\nstructure information provided by the pseudo-LiDAR point cloud is more direct\nthan the image. Compared with sparse LiDAR, the pseudo-LiDAR has a denser point\ncloud. In order to make full use of the rich point cloud information provided\nby the pseudo-LiDAR, a projection-aware dense odometry pipeline is adopted.\nMost previous LiDAR-based algorithms sampled 8192 points from the point cloud\nas input to the odometry network. The projection-aware dense odometry pipeline\ntakes all the pseudo-LiDAR point clouds generated from the images except for\nthe error points as the input to the network. While making full use of the 3D\ngeometric information in the images, the semantic information in the images is\nalso used in the odometry task. The fusion of 2D-3D is achieved in an\nimage-only based odometry. Experiments on the KITTI dataset prove the\neffectiveness of our method.

    "abstract": "Due to the frequent encountering of web URLs in various application scenarios\n(e.g., chatting and email reading), many mobile apps build their in-app\nbrowsing interfaces (IABIs) to provide a seamless user experience. Although\nthis achieves user-friendliness by avoiding the constant switching between the\nsubject app and the system built-in browser apps, we find that IABIs, if not\nwell designed or customized, could result in usability security risks. In this\npaper, we conduct the first empirical study on the usability (in)security of\nin-app browsing interfaces in both Android and iOS apps. Specifically, we\ncollect a dataset of 25 high-profile mobile apps from five common application\ncategories that contain IABIs, including Facebook and Gmail, and perform a\nsystematic analysis (not end-user study though) that comprises eight carefully\ndesigned security tests and covers the entire course of opening, displaying,\nand navigating an in-app web page. During this process, we obtain three major\nsecurity findings: (1) about 30% of the tested apps fail to provide enough URL\ninformation for users to make informed decisions on opening an URL; (2) nearly\nall custom IABIs have various problems in providing sufficient indicators to\nfaithfully display an in-app page to users, whereas ten IABIs that are based on\nChrome Custom Tabs and SFSafariViewController are generally secure; and (3)\nonly a few IABIs give warnings to remind users of the risk of inputting\npasswords during navigating a (potentially phishing) login page. Most\ndevelopers had acknowledged our findings but their willingness and readiness to\nfix usability issues are rather low compared to fixing technical\nvulnerabilities, which is a puzzle in usability security research.\nNevertheless, to help mitigate risky IABIs and guide future designs, we propose\na set of secure IABI design principles.",

    "title": "PhishClone: Measuring the Efficacy of Cloning Evasion Attacks",
    "abstract": "Web-based phishing accounts for over 90% of data breaches, and most\nweb-browsers and security vendors rely on machine-learning (ML) models as\nmitigation. Despite this, links posted regularly on anti-phishing aggregators\nsuch as PhishTank and VirusTotal are shown to easily bypass existing detectors.\nPrior art suggests that automated website cloning, with light mutations, is\ngaining traction with attackers. This has limited exposure in current\nliterature and leads to sub-optimal ML-based countermeasures. The work herein\nconducts the first empirical study that compiles and evaluates a variety of\nstate-of-the-art cloning techniques in wide circulation. We collected 13,394\nsamples and found 8,566 confirmed phishing pages targeting 4 popular websites\nusing 7 distinct cloning mechanisms. These samples were replicated with\nmalicious code removed within a controlled platform fortified with precautions\nthat prevent accidental access. We then reported our sites to VirusTotal and\nother platforms, with regular polling of results for 7 days, to ascertain the\nefficacy of each cloning technique. Results show that no security vendor\ndetected our clones, proving the urgent need for more effective detectors.\nFinally, we posit 4 recommendations to aid web developers and ML-based defences\nto alleviate the risks of cloning attacks.",

    "abstract": "The approximate degree of a Boolean function $f\\colon\\{0,1\\}^n\\to\\{0,1\\}$ is\nthe minimum degree of a real polynomial $p$ that approximates $f$ pointwise:\n$|f(x)-p(x)|\\leq1/3$ for all $x\\in\\{0,1\\}^n.$ For every $\\delta>0,$ we\nconstruct CNF and DNF formulas of polynomial size with approximate degree\n$\\Omega(n^{1-\\delta}),$ essentially matching the trivial upper bound of $n.$\nThis improves polynomially on previous lower bounds and fully resolves the\napproximate degree of constant-depth circuits ($\\text{AC}^0$), a question that\nhas seen extensive research over the past 10 years. Previously, an\n$\\Omega(n^{1-\\delta})$ lower bound was known only for $\\text{AC}^0$ circuits of\ndepth that grows with $1/\\delta$ (Bun and Thaler, FOCS 2017). Moreover, our CNF\nand DNF formulas are the simplest possible in that they have constant width.\nOur result holds even for one-sided approximation, and has the following\nfurther consequences.\n(i) We essentially settle the communication complexity of $\\text{AC}^0$\ncircuits in the bounded-error quantum model, $k$-party number-on-the-forehead\nrandomized model, and $k$-party number-on-the-forehead nondeterministic model:\nwe prove that for every $\\delta>0$, these models require\n$\\Omega(n^{1-\\delta})$, $\\Omega(n/4^kk^2)^{1-\\delta}$, and\n$\\Omega(n/4^kk^2)^{1-\\delta}$, respectively, bits of communication even for\npolynomial-size constant-width CNF formulas.\n(ii) In particular, we show that the multiparty communication class\n$\\text{coNP}_k$ can be separated essentially optimally from $\\text{NP}_k$ and\n$\\text{BPP}_k$ by a particularly simple function, a polynomial-size\nconstant-width CNF.\n(iii) We give an essentially tight separation, of $O(1)$ versus\n$\\Omega(n^{1-\\delta})$, for the one-sided versus two-sided approximate degree\nof a function; and $O(1)$ versus $\\Omega(n^{1-\\delta})$ for the one-sided\napproximate degree of a function $f$ versus its negation $\\neg f$.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we dive deep into the unique challenges in semi-supervised\nobject detection~(SSOD). We observe that current detectors generally suffer\nfrom 3 inconsistency problems. 1) Assignment inconsistency, that the\nconventional assignment policy is sensitive to labeling noise. 2) Subtasks\ninconsistency, where the classification and regression predictions are\nmisaligned at the same feature point. 3) Temporal inconsistency, that the\npseudo bboxes vary dramatically at different training steps. These issues lead\nto inconsistent optimization objectives of the student network, thus\ndeteriorating performance and slowing down the model convergence. We,\ntherefore, propose a systematic solution, termed Consistent Teacher, to remedy\nthe above-mentioned challenges. First, adaptive anchor assignment substitutes\nthe static IoU-based strategy, which enables the student network to be\nresistant to noisy psudo bboxes; Then we calibrate the subtask predictions by\ndesigning a feature alignment module; Lastly, We adopt a Gaussian Mixture Model\n(GMM) to dynamically adjust the pseudo-boxes threshold. Consistent Teacher\nprovides a new strong baseline on a large range of SSOD evaluations. It\nachieves 40.0 mAP with ResNet-50 backbone given only 10% of annotated MS-COCO\ndata, which surpasses previous baselines using pseudo labels by around 4 mAP.\nWhen trained on fully annotated MS-COCO with additional unlabeled data, the\nperformance further increases to 49.1 mAP. Our code will be open-sourced soon.",

Extensive research during the past few decades has\nled to the invention of various algorithms. However, the known\ncomputationally-efficient solutions show a tradeoff between convergence speed\nand accuracy. Moreover, running these algorithms involves heuristically setting\nvarious parameters that considerably affect their performances. In this paper,\nwe propose a new algorithm which we refer to as online block maximum likelihood\n(OBML). OBML is a computationally-efficient online learning algorithm that\nemploys maximum likelihood (ML) estimation every $P$ samples. We fully\ncharacterize the expected performance of OBML and show that i) OBML is able to\nasymptotically recover the unknown coefficients and ii) its expected estimation\nerror asymptotically converges to zero as $O({1\\over t})$. We also derive an\nalternative version of OBML, which we refer to as incremental maximum\nlikelihood (IML), which incrementally updates its ML estimate of the\ncoefficients at every sample.

Such graphical structure is thus a store house rich information. This\nhas various implication depending on whether we are interested in a node or the\ngraph as a whole. In this paper, we are primarily concerned with the later,\nthat is, the inference that the structure of the graph influences the property\nof the real life system it represents. A model of such structural influence\nwould be useful in inferencing useful properties of complex and large systems,\nlike VLSI circuits, through its structural property. However, before we can\napply some machine learning (ML) based technique to model such relationship, an\neffective representation of the graph is imperative. In this paper, we propose\na graph representation which is lossless, linear-sized in terms of number of\nvertices and gives a 1-D representation of the graph. Our representation is\nbased on Prufer encoding for trees. Moreover, our method is based on a novel\ntechnique, called $\\mathcal{GT}$-enhancement whereby we first transform the\ngraph such that it can be represented by a singular tree.

This problem is particularly challenging due\nto the topological obstructions induced by the obstacle, which preclude the\nexistence of smooth feedback controllers able to achieve simultaneous\nstabilization and robust obstacle avoidance. To overcome this issue, we develop\na vision-based hybrid controller that switches between two different feedback\nlaws depending on the current position of the vehicle using a hysteresis\nmechanism and a data-assisted supervisor. The main innovation of the paper is\nthe incorporation of suitable perception maps into the hybrid controller. These\nmaps can be learned from data obtained from cameras in the vehicles and trained\nvia convolutional neural networks (CNN). Under suitable assumptions on this\nperception map, we establish theoretical guarantees for the trajectories of the\nvehicle in terms of convergence and obstacle avoidance.

    "abstract": "Under what circumstances can a system be said to have beliefs and goals, and\nhow do such agency-related features relate to its physical state? Recent work\nhas proposed a notion of interpretation map, a function that maps the state of\na system to a probability distribution representing its beliefs about an\nexternal world. Such a map is not completely arbitrary, as the beliefs it\nattributes to the system must evolve over time in a manner that is consistent\nwith Bayes' theorem, and consequently the dynamics of a system constrain its\npossible interpretations. Here we build on this approach, proposing a notion of\ninterpretation not just in terms of beliefs but in terms of goals and actions.\nTo do this we make use of the existing theory of partially observable Markov\nprocesses (POMDPs): we say that a system can be interpreted as a solution to a\nPOMDP if it not only admits an interpretation map describing its beliefs about\nthe hidden state of a POMDP but also takes actions that are optimal according\nto its belief state. An agent is then a system together with an interpretation\nof this system as a POMDP solution. Although POMDPs are not the only possible\nformulation of what it means to have a goal, this nevertheless represents a\nstep towards a more general formal definition of what it means for a system to\nbe an agent.",

    "title": "MAFormer: A Transformer Network with Multi-scale Attention Fusion for  Visual Recognition",
    "abstract": "Vision Transformer and its variants have demonstrated great potential in\nvarious computer vision tasks. But conventional vision transformers often focus\non global dependency at a coarse level, which suffer from a learning challenge\non global relationships and fine-grained representation at a token level. In\nthis paper, we introduce Multi-scale Attention Fusion into transformer\n(MAFormer), which explores local aggregation and global feature extraction in a\ndual-stream framework for visual recognition. We develop a simple but effective\nmodule to explore the full potential of transformers for visual representation\nby learning fine-grained and coarse-grained features at a token level and\ndynamically fusing them. Our Multi-scale Attention Fusion (MAF) block consists\nof: i) a local window attention branch that learns short-range interactions\nwithin windows, aggregating fine-grained local features; ii) global feature\nextraction through a novel Global Learning with Down-sampling (GLD) operation\nto efficiently capture long-range context information within the whole image;\niii) a fusion module that self-explores the integration of both features via\nattention. Our MAFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on common vision\ntasks. In particular, MAFormer-L achieves 85.9$\\%$ Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet,\nsurpassing CSWin-B and LV-ViT-L by 1.7$\\%$ and 0.6$\\%$ respectively. On MSCOCO,\nMAFormer outperforms the prior art CSWin by 1.7$\\%$ mAPs on object detection\nand 1.4$\\%$ on instance segmentation with similar-sized parameters,\ndemonstrating the potential to be a general backbone network.",

    "title": "Interactive Question Answering Systems: Literature Review",
    "abstract": "Question answering systems are recognized as popular and frequently effective\nmeans of information seeking on the web. In such systems, information seekers\ncan receive a concise response to their query by presenting their questions in\nnatural language. Interactive question answering is a recently proposed and\nincreasingly popular solution that resides at the intersection of question\nanswering and dialogue systems. On the one hand, the user can ask questions in\nnormal language and locate the actual response to her inquiry; on the other\nhand, the system can prolong the question-answering session into a dialogue if\nthere are multiple probable replies, very few, or ambiguities in the initial\nrequest. By permitting the user to ask more questions, interactive question\nanswering enables users to dynamically interact with the system and receive\nmore precise results. This survey offers a detailed overview of the interactive\nquestion-answering methods that are prevalent in current literature. It begins\nby explaining the foundational principles of question-answering systems, hence\ndefining new notations and taxonomies to combine all identified works inside a\nunified framework. The reviewed published work on interactive\nquestion-answering systems is then presented and examined in terms of its\nproposed methodology, evaluation approaches, and dataset/application domain. We\nalso describe trends surrounding specific tasks and issues raised by the\ncommunity, so shedding light on the future interests of scholars. Our work is\nfurther supported by a GitHub page with a synthesis of all the major topics\ncovered in this literature study.\nhttps://sisinflab.github.io/interactive-question-answering-systems-survey/",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider a general notion of convolution. Let $D$ be a\nfinite domain and let $D^n$ be the set of $n$-length vectors (tuples) of $D$.\nLet $f : D \\times D \\to D$ be a function and let $\\oplus_f$ be a\ncoordinate-wise application of $f$. The $f$-Convolution of two functions $g,h :\nD^n \\to \\{-M,\\ldots,M\\}$ is $$(g \\otimes_f h)(\\textbf{v}) :=\n\\sum_{\\substack{\\textbf{v}_g,\\textbf{v}_h \\in D^n \\text{s.t. } \\textbf{v}_g\n\\oplus_f \\textbf{v}_h}} g(\\textbf{v}_g) \\cdot h(\\textbf{v}_h) $$ for every\n$\\textbf{v} \\in D^n$. This problem generalizes many fundamental convolutions\nsuch as Subset Convolution, XOR Product, Covering Product or Packing Product,\netc. For arbitrary function $f$ and domain $D$ we can compute $f$-Convolution\nvia brute-force enumeration in $\\widetilde{O}(|D|^{2n}\\mathrm{polylog}(M))$\ntime.\nOur main result is an improvement over this naive algorithm. We show that\n$f$-Convolution can be computed exactly in $\\widetilde{O}((c \\cdot\n|D|^2)^{n}\\mathrm{polylog(M)})$ for constant $c := 5/6$ when $D$ has even\ncardinality. Our main observation is that a \\emph{cyclic partition} of a\nfunction $f : D \\times D \\to D$ can be used to speed up the computation of\n$f$-Convolution, and we show that an appropriate cyclic partition exists for\nevery $f$.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that a single entry of the $f$-Convolution can be\ncomputed more efficiently. In this variant, we are given two functions $g,h :\nD^n \\to \\{-M,\\ldots,M\\}$ alongside with a vector $\\textbf{v} \\in D^n$ and the\ntask of the $f$-Query problem is to compute integer $(g \\otimes_f\nh)(\\textbf{v})$.

It is necessary to train a model only on source domain\n(SD) and directly transferring the model to target domain (TD), when TD needs\nto be processed in real time and cannot be reused for training. Based on the\nidea of domain generalization, a Single-source Domain Expansion Network\n(SDEnet) is developed to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of domain\nextension. The method uses generative adversarial learning to train in SD and\ntest in TD. A generator including semantic encoder and morph encoder is\ndesigned to generate the extended domain (ED) based on\nencoder-randomization-decoder architecture, where spatial and spectral\nrandomization are specifically used to generate variable spatial and spectral\ninformation, and the morphological knowledge is implicitly applied as domain\ninvariant information during domain expansion. Furthermore, the supervised\ncontrastive learning is employed in the discriminator to learn class-wise\ndomain invariant representation, which drives intra-class samples of SD and ED.\nMeanwhile, adversarial training is designed to optimize the generator to drive\nintra-class samples of SD and ED to be separated. Extensive experiments on two\npublic HSI datasets and one additional multispectral image (MSI) dataset\ndemonstrate the superiority of the proposed method when compared with\nstate-of-the-art techniques.",

    "abstract": "Traditionally, DBMSs separate their storage layer from their indexing layer.\nWhile the storage layer physically materializes the database and provides\nlow-level access methods to it, the indexing layer on top enables a faster\nlocating of searched-for entries. While this clearly separates concerns, it\nalso adds a level of indirection to the already complex execution path. In this\nwork, we propose an alternative design: Instead of conservatively separating\nboth layers, we naturally fuse them by integrating an adaptive coarse-granular\nindexing scheme directly into the storage layer. We do so by utilizing tools of\nthe virtual memory management subsystem provided by the OS: On the lowest\nlevel, we materialize the database content in form of physical main memory. On\ntop of that, we allow the creation of arbitrarily many virtual memory storage\nviews that map to subsets of the database having certain properties of\ninterest. This creation happens fully adaptively as a side-product of query\nprocessing. To speed up query answering, we route each query automatically to\nthe most fitting virtual view(s).

Unlike image captioning,\nstory generation from an image poses multiple challenges: preserving the story\ncoherence, appropriately assessing the quality of the story, steering the\ngenerated story into a certain style, and addressing the scarcity of\nimage-story pair reference datasets limiting supervision during training. In\nthis work, we introduce Plug-and-Play Story Teller (PPST) and improve\nimage-to-story generation by: 1) alleviating the data scarcity problem by\nincorporating large pre-trained models, namely CLIP and GPT-2, to facilitate a\nfluent image-to-text generation with minimal supervision, and 2) enabling a\nmore style-relevant generation by incorporating stylistic adapters to control\nthe story generation.

    "abstract": "Fraud detection is a challenging task due to the changing nature of fraud\npatterns over time and the limited availability of fraud examples to learn such\nsophisticated patterns. Thus, fraud detection with the aid of smart versions of\nmachine learning (ML) tools is essential to assure safety. Fraud detection is a\nprimary ML classification task; however, the optimum performance of the\ncorresponding ML tool relies on the usage of the best hyperparameter values.\nMoreover, classification under imbalanced classes is quite challenging as it\ncauses poor performance in minority classes, which most ML classification\ntechniques ignore. Thus, we investigate four state-of-the-art ML techniques,\nnamely, logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, and extreme\ngradient boost, that are suitable for handling imbalance classes to maximize\nprecision and simultaneously reduce false positives. First, these classifiers\nare trained on two original benchmark unbalanced fraud detection datasets,\nnamely, phishing website URLs and fraudulent credit card transactions. Then,\nthree synthetically balanced datasets are produced for each original data set\nby implementing the sampling frameworks, namely, RandomUnderSampler, SMOTE, and\nSMOTEENN. The optimum hyperparameters for all the 16 experiments are revealed\nusing the method RandomzedSearchCV. The validity of the 16 approaches in the\ncontext of fraud detection is compared using two benchmark performance metrics,\nnamely, area under the curve of receiver operating characteristics (AUC ROC)\nand area under the curve of precision and recall (AUC PR).

    "abstract": "Exposure bias is a well-known issue in recommender systems where items and\nsuppliers are not equally represented in the recommendation results. This is\nespecially problematic when bias is amplified over time as a few items (e.g.,\npopular ones) are repeatedly over-represented in recommendation lists and\nusers' interactions with those items will amplify bias towards those items over\ntime resulting in a feedback loop. This issue has been extensively studied in\nthe literature on model-based or neighborhood-based recommendation algorithms,\nbut less work has been done on online recommendation models, such as those\nbased on top-K contextual bandits, where recommendation models are dynamically\nupdated with ongoing user feedback. In this paper, we study exposure bias in a\nclass of well-known contextual bandit algorithms known as Linear Cascading\nBandits. We analyze these algorithms on their ability to handle exposure bias\nand provide a fair representation for items in the recommendation results. Our\nanalysis reveals that these algorithms tend to amplify exposure disparity among\nitems over time. In particular, we observe that these algorithms do not\nproperly adapt to the feedback provided by the users and frequently recommend\ncertain items even when those items are not selected by users. To mitigate this\nbias, we propose an Exposure-Aware (EA) reward model that updates the model\nparameters based on two factors: 1) user feedback (i.e., clicked or not), and\n2) position of the item in the recommendation list. This way, the proposed\nmodel controls the utility assigned to items based on their exposure in the\nrecommendation list. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets using\nthree contextual bandit algorithms show that the proposed reward model reduces\nexposure bias amplification in long run while maintaining the recommendation\naccuracy.",

This class of architecture encompasses\nMixture-of-Experts, Switch Transformers, Routing Networks, BASE layers, and\nothers, all with the unifying idea that each example is acted on by a subset of\nthe parameters. By doing so, the degree of sparsity decouples the parameter\ncount from the compute per example allowing for extremely large, but efficient\nmodels. The resulting models have demonstrated significant improvements across\ndiverse domains such as natural language processing, computer vision, and\nspeech recognition. We review the concept of sparse expert models, provide a\nbasic description of the common algorithms, contextualize the advances in the\ndeep learning era, and conclude by highlighting areas for future work.",

The system's dynamics are obtained by the\nEuler Lagrange method and are approximated for small-angle as balancing the\npendulum is the objective.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a two-stage prediction-based control scheme for embedding\nthe environment's geometric properties into a collision-free Pythagorean\nHodograph spline, and subsequently finding the optimal path within the\nparameterized free space. The ingredients of this approach are twofold: First,\nwe present a novel spatial path parameterization applicable to any arbitrary\ncurve without prior assumptions in its adapted frame. Second, we identify the\nappropriateness of Pythagorean Hodograph curves for a compact and continuous\ndefinition of the path-parametric functions required by the presented spatial\nmodel. This dual-stage formulation results in a motion planning approach, where\nthe geometric properties of the environment arise as states of the prediction\nmodel. Thus, the presented method is attractive for motion planning in dense\nenvironments. The efficacy of the approach is evaluated according to an\nillustrative example.",

We also considered suspicious\nYouTube videos shared on Twitter. To identify spreaders of vaccine\nmisinformation, we focused on verified Twitter accounts and employed a bot\ndetection algorithm to identify accounts that are likely automated. Our\nfindings show a low prevalence of low-credibility information compared to\nmainstream news. However, most popular low-credibility sources had reshare\nvolumes comparable to many mainstream sources, and larger volumes than\nauthoritative sources such as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention and the World Health Organization. Throughout the year, we observed\nan increasing trend in the prevalence of low-credibility news relative to\nmainstream news about vaccines. We also observed a considerable amount of\nsuspicious YouTube videos shared on Twitter. We found that tweets by a small\ngroup of about 800 superspreaders verified by Twitter accounted for\napproximately 35% of all reshares of misinformation on the average day, with\nthe top superspreader (RobertKennedyJr) being responsible for over 13% of\nretweets.

    "abstract": "Variational inference (VI) is a specific type of approximate Bayesian\ninference that approximates an intractable posterior distribution with a\ntractable one. VI casts the inference problem as an optimization problem, more\nspecifically, the goal is to maximize a lower bound of the logarithm of the\nmarginal likelihood with respect to the parameters of the approximate\nposterior. Reinforcement learning (RL) on the other hand deals with autonomous\nagents and how to make them act optimally such as to maximize some notion of\nexpected future cumulative reward. In the non-sequential setting where agents'\nactions do not have an impact on future states of the environment, RL is\ncovered by contextual bandits and Bayesian optimization. In a proper sequential\nscenario, however, where agents' actions affect future states, instantaneous\nrewards need to be carefully traded off against potential long-term rewards.\nThis manuscript shows how the apparently different subjects of VI and RL are\nlinked in two fundamental ways. First, the optimization objective of RL to\nmaximize future cumulative rewards can be recovered via a VI objective under a\nsoft policy constraint in both the non-sequential and the sequential setting.\nThis policy constraint is not just merely artificial but has proven as a useful\nregularizer in many RL tasks yielding significant improvements in agent\nperformance. And second, in model-based RL where agents aim to learn about the\nenvironment they are operating in, the model-learning part can be naturally\nphrased as an inference problem over the process that governs environment\ndynamics. We are going to distinguish between two scenarios for the latter: VI\nwhen environment states are fully observable by the agent and VI when they are\nonly partially observable through an observation distribution.",

The questionnaires' results demonstrate that youths perceive iCub as a\nfriend and, typically, in a positive way.

Furthermore, trust towards the robot in group cognitive\nactivity appears to change according to gender: after two consecutive mistakes\nby the robot, girls tended to trust iCub more than boys. Finally, no\nsignificant difference has been evidenced between different age groups across\npoints computed from the game and the self-reported scales.

Specifically, we\nformulate a recursive multi-task GP with and without network connectivity\ninformation to reconcile the multi time-scale measurements in distribution\nsystems. The proposed framework is capable of aggregating the multi-time scale\nmeasurements batch-wise or in real-time. Following the aggregation of the multi\ntime-scale measurements, the spatial states of the consistent time-series are\nestimated using matrix completion based DSSE approach.

Our experiments show that the OS\nscheduling policy of cloud functions' host server can have a crucial impact on\nperformance. The default Linux scheduler, CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler),\nbeing oblivious to workloads, frequently context-switches short functions,\ncausing a turnaround time that is much longer than their service time.\nWe propose SFS (Smart Function Scheduler),which works entirely in the user\nspace and carefully orchestrates existing Linux FIFO and CFS schedulers to\napproximate Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF). SFS uses two-level scheduling\nthat seamlessly combines a new FILTER policy with Linux CFS, to trade off\nincreased duration of long functions for significant performance improvement\nfor short functions. We implement {\\proj} in the Linux user space and port it\nto OpenLambda. Evaluation results show that SFS significantly improves short\nfunctions' duration with a small impact on relatively longer functions,\ncompared to CFS.",

    "abstract": "As Autonomous Vehicle (AV) development has progressed, concerns regarding the\nsafety of passengers and agents in their environment have risen. Each real\nworld traffic collision involving autonomously controlled vehicles has\ncompounded this concern. Open source autonomous driving implementations show a\nsoftware architecture with complex interdependent tasks, heavily reliant on\nmachine learning and Deep Neural Networks (DNN), which are vulnerable to non\ndeterministic faults and corner cases. These complex subsystems work together\nto fulfill the mission of the AV while also maintaining safety. Although\nsignificant improvements are being made towards increasing the empirical\nreliability and confidence in these systems, the inherent limitations of DNN\nverification create an, as yet, insurmountable challenge in providing\ndeterministic safety guarantees in AV.\nWe propose Synergistic Redundancy (SR), a safety architecture for complex\ncyber physical systems, like AV. SR provides verifiable safety guarantees\nagainst specific faults by decoupling the mission and safety tasks of the\nsystem. Simultaneous to independently fulfilling their primary roles, the\npartially functionally redundant mission and safety tasks are able to aid each\nother, synergistically improving the combined system. The synergistic safety\nlayer uses only verifiable and logically analyzable software to fulfill its\ntasks. Close coordination with the mission layer allows easier and early\ndetection of safety critical faults in the system. SR simplifies the mission\nlayer's optimization goals and improves its design. SR provides safe deployment\nof high performance, although inherently unverifiable, machine learning\nsoftware. In this work, we first present the design and features of the SR\narchitecture and then evaluate the efficacy of the solution, focusing on the\ncrucial problem of obstacle existence detection faults in AV.",

    "abstract": "Logic locking protects an IC from threats such as piracy of design IP and\nunauthorized overproduction throughout the IC supply chain. Out of the several\ntechniques proposed by the research community, provably-secure logic locking\n(PSLL) has acquired a foothold due to its algorithmic and provable-security\nguarantees. However, the security of these techniques is questioned by\nattackers that exploit the vulnerabilities arising from the hardware\nimplementation. Such attacks (i) are predominantly specific to locking\ntechniques and (ii) lack generality and scalability. This leads to a plethora\nof attacks, and defenders, find it challenging to ascertain the security of\nnewly developed PSLL techniques. Additionally, there is no repository of locked\ncircuits that attackers can use to benchmark (and compare) their attacks.\nIn this work, we develop a generalized attack that can recover the secret key\nacross different PSLL techniques. To that end, we extract functional and\nstructural properties depending on the hardware construction of the PSLL\ntechniques and develop two attacks based on the concepts of VLSI testing and\nBoolean transformations. We evaluate our attacks on 30,000 locked circuits\nacross 14 PSLL techniques, including nine unbroken techniques. Our attacks\nsuccessfully recover the secret key (100% accuracy) for all the techniques. Our\nexperimentation across different (I) technology libraries, (ii) synthesis\ntools, and (iii) logic optimization settings provide interesting insights. For\ninstance, our attacks recover the secret key by only using the locked circuit\nwhen an academic synthesis tool is used. Additionally, designers can use our\nattacks as a verification tool to ascertain the lower-bound security achieved\nby hardware implementations. We shall release our artifacts, which could help\nfoster the development of future attacks and defenses in the PSLL domain.",

    "abstract": "Trojan backdoor is a poisoning attack against Neural Network (NN) classifiers\nin which adversaries try to exploit the (highly desirable) model reuse property\nto implant Trojans into model parameters for backdoor breaches through a\npoisoned training process. Most of the proposed defenses against Trojan attacks\nassume a white-box setup, in which the defender either has access to the inner\nstate of NN or is able to run back-propagation through it. In this work, we\npropose a more practical black-box defense, dubbed TrojDef, which can only run\nforward-pass of the NN. TrojDef tries to identify and filter out Trojan inputs\n(i.e., inputs augmented with the Trojan trigger) by monitoring the changes in\nthe prediction confidence when the input is repeatedly perturbed by random\nnoise. We derive a function based on the prediction outputs which is called the\nprediction confidence bound to decide whether the input example is Trojan or\nnot. The intuition is that Trojan inputs are more stable as the\nmisclassification only depends on the trigger, while benign inputs will suffer\nwhen augmented with noise due to the perturbation of the classification\nfeatures.\nThrough mathematical analysis, we show that if the attacker is perfect in\ninjecting the backdoor, the Trojan infected model will be trained to learn the\nappropriate prediction confidence bound, which is used to distinguish Trojan\nand benign inputs under arbitrary perturbations. However, because the attacker\nmight not be perfect in injecting the backdoor, we introduce a nonlinear\ntransform to the prediction confidence bound to improve the detection accuracy\nin practical settings. Extensive empirical evaluations show that TrojDef\nsignificantly outperforms the-state-of-the-art defenses and is highly stable\nunder different settings, even when the classifier architecture, the training\nprocess, or the hyper-parameters change.",

Recently, Transformer has demonstrated promising performance on\nmany 2D and even 3D vision tasks. Compared with the fixed and rigid convolution\nkernels, the self-attention mechanism in Transformer can adaptively exclude the\nunrelated or noisy points and thus suitable for preserving the local spatial\nstructure in irregular LiDAR point cloud. However, Transformer only performs a\nsimple sum on the point features, based on the self-attention mechanism, and\nall the points share the same transformation for value. Such isotropic\noperation lacks the ability to capture the direction-distance-oriented local\nstructure which is important for 3D object detection. In this work, we propose\na Structure-Embedding transFormer (SEFormer), which can not only preserve local\nstructure as traditional Transformer but also have the ability to encode the\nlocal structure. Compared to the self-attention mechanism in traditional\nTransformer, SEFormer learns different feature transformations for value points\nbased on the relative directions and distances to the query point.

    "abstract": "NURBS-based discretizations suffer from membrane locking when applied to\nprimal formulations of curved thin-walled structures. We consider linear plane\ncurved Kirchhoff rods as a model problem to study how to remove membrane\nlocking from NURBS-based discretizations. In this work, we propose\ncontinuous-assumed-strain (CAS) elements, an assumed strain treatment that\nremoves membrane locking from quadratic NURBS for an ample range of slenderness\nratios. CAS elements take advantage of the C1 inter-element continuity of the\ndisplacement vector given by quadratic NURBS to interpolate the membrane strain\nusing linear Lagrange polynomials while preserving the C0 inter-element\ncontinuity of the membrane strain. CAS elements are the first NURBS-based\nelement type able to remove membrane locking for a broad range of slenderness\nratios that combines the following characteristics: (1) No additional degrees\nof freedom are added, (2) No additional systems of algebraic equations need to\nbe solved, and (3) The nonzero pattern of the stiffness matrix is preserved.\nSince the only additional computations required by the proposed element type\nare to evaluate the derivatives of the basis functions and the unit tangent\nvector at the knots, the proposed scheme barely increases the computational\ncost with respect to the locking-prone NURBS-based discretization of the primal\nformulation. The benchmark problems show that the convergence of CAS elements\nis independent of the slenderness ratio while the convergence of quadratic\nNURBS elements, local Bbar elements, and local ANS elements depends heavily on\nthe slenderness ratio. The numerical examples also show how CAS elements remove\nthe spurious oscillations in stress resultants caused by membrane locking while\nquadratic NURBS elements, local Bbar elements, and local ANS elements suffer\nfrom large-amplitude spurious oscillations in stress resultants.",

    "title": "Boost Decentralized Federated Learning in Vehicular Networks by  Diversifying Data Sources",
    "abstract": "Recently, federated learning (FL) has received intensive research because of\nits ability in preserving data privacy for scattered clients to collaboratively\ntrain machine learning models. Commonly, a parameter server (PS) is deployed\nfor aggregating model parameters contributed by different clients.\nDecentralized federated learning (DFL) is upgraded from FL which allows clients\nto aggregate model parameters with their neighbours directly. DFL is\nparticularly feasible for vehicular networks as vehicles communicate with each\nother in a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) manner. However, due to the restrictions of\nvehicle routes and communication distances, it is hard for individual vehicles\nto sufficiently exchange models with others. Data sources contributing to\nmodels on individual vehicles may not diversified enough resulting in poor\nmodel accuracy. To address this problem, we propose the DFL-DDS (DFL with\ndiversified Data Sources) algorithm to diversify data sources in DFL.\nSpecifically, each vehicle maintains a state vector to record the contribution\nweight of each data source to its model. The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence\nis adopted to measure the diversity of a state vector. To boost the convergence\nof DFL, a vehicle tunes the aggregation weight of each data source by\nminimizing the KL divergence of its state vector, and its effectiveness in\ndiversifying data sources can be theoretically proved. Finally, the superiority\nof DFL-DDS is evaluated by extensive experiments (with MNIST and CIFAR-10\ndatasets) which demonstrate that DFL-DDS can accelerate the convergence of DFL\nand improve the model accuracy significantly compared with state-of-the-art\nbaselines.",

    "abstract": "While generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been widely used in\nresearch on audio generation, the training of a GAN model is known to be\nunstable, time consuming, and data inefficient. Among the attempts to\nameliorate the training process of GANs, the idea of Projected GAN emerges as\nan effective solution for GAN-based image generation, establishing the\nstate-of-the-art in different image applications. The core idea is to use a\npre-trained classifier to constrain the feature space of the discriminator to\nstabilize and improve GAN training. This paper investigates whether Projected\nGAN can similarly improve audio generation, by evaluating the performance of a\nStyleGAN2-based audio-domain loop generation model with and without using a\npre-trained feature space in the discriminator. Moreover, we compare the\nperformance of using a general versus domain-specific classifier as the\npre-trained audio classifier. With experiments on both drum loop and synth loop\ngeneration, we show that a general audio classifier works better, and that with\nProjected GAN our loop generation models can converge around 5 times faster\nwithout performance degradation.",

    "abstract": "While Transformers have had significant success in paragraph generation, they\ntreat sentences as linear sequences of tokens and often neglect their\nhierarchical information. Prior work has shown that decomposing the levels of\ngranularity~(e.g., word, phrase, or sentence) for input tokens has produced\nsubstantial improvements, suggesting the possibility of enhancing Transformers\nvia more fine-grained modeling of granularity. In this work, we propose a\ncontinuous decomposition of granularity for neural paraphrase generation\n(C-DNPG). In order to efficiently incorporate granularity into sentence\nencoding, C-DNPG introduces a granularity-aware attention (GA-Attention)\nmechanism which extends the multi-head self-attention with: 1) a granularity\nhead that automatically infers the hierarchical structure of a sentence by\nneurally estimating the granularity level of each input token; and 2) two novel\nattention masks, namely, granularity resonance and granularity scope, to\nefficiently encode granularity into attention. Experiments on two benchmarks,\nincluding Quora question pairs and Twitter URLs have shown that C-DNPG\noutperforms baseline models by a remarkable margin and achieves\nstate-of-the-art results in terms of many metrics. Qualitative analysis reveals\nthat C-DNPG indeed captures fine-grained levels of granularity with\neffectiveness.",

The visual hint is less evident than the\nacoustic hint, but more robust in a complex acoustic environment, as far as\nspeech perception is concerned. It remains a challenge how we effectively\nexploit the interaction between audio and visual signals for automatic speech\nrecognition. There have been studies to exploit visual signals as redundant or\ncomplementary information to audio input in a synchronous manner. Human studies\nsuggest that visual signal primes the listener in advance as to when and on\nwhich frequency to attend to. We propose a Predict-and-Update Network (P&U\nnet), to simulate such a visual cueing mechanism for Audio-Visual Speech\nRecognition (AVSR). In particular, we first predict the character posteriors of\nthe spoken words, i.e. the visual embedding, based on the visual signals. The\naudio signal is then conditioned on the visual embedding via a novel\ncross-modal Conformer, that updates the character posteriors. We validate the\neffectiveness of the visual cueing mechanism through extensive experiments. The\nproposed P&U net outperforms the state-of-the-art AVSR methods on both LRS2-BBC\nand LRS3-BBC datasets, with the relative reduced Word Error Rate (WER)s\nexceeding 10% and 40% under clean and noisy conditions, respectively.",

ElasticROS\ndevelops elastic collaborative computing to achieve adaptability to dynamic\nconditions. The collaborative computing algorithm is the core and challenge of\nElasticROS.

    "abstract": "Understanding the decision process of neural networks is hard. One vital\nmethod for explanation is to attribute its decision to pivotal features.\nAlthough many algorithms are proposed, most of them solely improve the\nfaithfulness to the model. However, the real environment contains many random\nnoises, which may leads to great fluctuations in the explanations. More\nseriously, recent works show that explanation algorithms are vulnerable to\nadversarial attacks. All of these make the explanation hard to trust in real\nscenarios.\nTo bridge this gap, we propose a model-agnostic method \\emph{Median Test for\nFeature Attribution} (MeTFA) to quantify the uncertainty and increase the\nstability of explanation algorithms with theoretical guarantees. MeTFA has the\nfollowing two functions: (1) examine whether one feature is significantly\nimportant or unimportant and generate a MeTFA-significant map to visualize the\nresults; (2) compute the confidence interval of a feature attribution score and\ngenerate a MeTFA-smoothed map to increase the stability of the explanation.\nExperiments show that MeTFA improves the visual quality of explanations and\nsignificantly reduces the instability while maintaining the faithfulness. To\nquantitatively evaluate the faithfulness of an explanation under different\nnoise settings, we further propose several robust faithfulness metrics.\nExperiment results show that the MeTFA-smoothed explanation can significantly\nincrease the robust faithfulness. In addition, we use two scenarios to show\nMeTFA's potential in the applications.

Undiscovered micro-architectural bugs in\nprocessors can manifest as severe security vulnerabilities in the form of side\nchannels, functional bugs, etc. Inspired by software fuzzing, a technique\ncommonly used for software testing, multiple recent works use hardware fuzzing\nfor the verification of Register-Transfer Level (RTL) designs. However, these\nworks suffer from several limitations such as lack of support for widely-used\nHardware Description Languages (HDLs) and misleading coverage-signals that\nmisidentify \"interesting\" inputs. Towards overcoming these shortcomings, we\npresent ProcessorFuzz, a processor fuzzer that guides the fuzzer with a novel\nCSR-transition coverage metric. ProcessorFuzz monitors the transitions in\nControl and Status Registers (CSRs) as CSRs are in charge of controlling and\nholding the state of the processor. Therefore, transitions in CSRs indicate a\nnew processor state, and guiding the fuzzer based on this feedback enables\nProcessorFuzz to explore new processor states. ProcessorFuzz is agnostic to the\nHDL and does not require any instrumentation in the processor design. Thus, it\nsupports a wide range of RTL designs written in different hardware languages.\nWe evaluated ProcessorFuzz with three real-world open-source processors --\nRocket, BOOM, and BlackParrot.

    "abstract": "The task of Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection targets fine-grained\nvisual parsing of humans interacting with their environment, enabling a broad\nrange of applications. Prior work has demonstrated the benefits of effective\narchitecture design and integration of relevant cues for more accurate HOI\ndetection. However, the design of an appropriate pre-training strategy for this\ntask remains underexplored by existing approaches. To address this gap, we\npropose Relational Language-Image Pre-training (RLIP), a strategy for\ncontrastive pre-training that leverages both entity and relation descriptions.\nTo make effective use of such pre-training, we make three technical\ncontributions: (1) a new Parallel entity detection and Sequential relation\ninference (ParSe) architecture that enables the use of both entity and relation\ndescriptions during holistically optimized pre-training; (2) a synthetic data\ngeneration framework, Label Sequence Extension, that expands the scale of\nlanguage data available within each minibatch; (3) mechanisms to account for\nambiguity, Relation Quality Labels and Relation Pseudo-Labels, to mitigate the\ninfluence of ambiguous/noisy samples in the pre-training data. Through\nextensive experiments, we demonstrate the benefits of these contributions,\ncollectively termed RLIP-ParSe, for improved zero-shot, few-shot and\nfine-tuning HOI detection performance as well as increased robustness to\nlearning from noisy annotations.

    "abstract": "This paper presents Macquarie University's participation to the two most\nrecent BioASQ Synergy Tasks (as per June 2022), and to the BioASQ10 Task~B\n(BioASQ10b), Phase~B. In these tasks, participating systems are expected to\ngenerate complex answers to biomedical questions, where the answers may contain\nmore than one sentence. We apply query-focused extractive summarisation\ntechniques. In particular, we follow a sentence classification-based approach\nthat scores each candidate sentence associated to a question, and the $n$\nhighest-scoring sentences are returned as the answer. The Synergy Task\ncorresponds to an end-to-end system that requires document selection, snippet\nselection, and finding the final answer, but it has very limited training data.\nFor the Synergy task, we selected the candidate sentences following two phases:\ndocument retrieval and snippet retrieval, and the final answer was found by\nusing a DistilBERT/ALBERT classifier that had been trained on the training data\nof BioASQ9b. Document retrieval was achieved as a standard search over the\nCORD-19 data using the search API provided by the BioASQ organisers, and\nsnippet retrieval was achieved by re-ranking the sentences of the top retrieved\ndocuments, using the cosine similarity of the question and candidate sentence.\nWe observed that vectors represented via sBERT have an edge over tf.idf.\nBioASQ10b Phase B focuses on finding the specific answers to biomedical\nquestions. For this task, we followed a data-centric approach. We hypothesised\nthat the training data of the first BioASQ years might be biased and we\nexperimented with different subsets of the training data. We observed an\nimprovement of results when the system was trained on the second half of the\nBioASQ10b training data.",

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection with only prior knowledge from normal samples attracts more\nattention because of the lack of anomaly samples. Existing CNN-based pixel\nreconstruction approaches suffer from two concerns. First, the reconstruction\nsource and target are raw pixel values that contain indistinguishable semantic\ninformation. Second, CNN tends to reconstruct both normal samples and anomalies\nwell, making them still hard to distinguish. In this paper, we propose Anomaly\nDetection TRansformer (ADTR) to apply a transformer to reconstruct pre-trained\nfeatures. The pre-trained features contain distinguishable semantic\ninformation. Also, the adoption of transformer limits to reconstruct anomalies\nwell such that anomalies could be detected easily once the reconstruction\nfails. Moreover, we propose novel loss functions to make our approach\ncompatible with the normal-sample-only case and the anomaly-available case with\nboth image-level and pixel-level labeled anomalies. The performance could be\nfurther improved by adding simple synthetic or external irrelevant anomalies.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on anomaly detection datasets including\nMVTec-AD and CIFAR-10. Our method achieves superior performance compared with\nall baselines.",

Furthermore, it decouples the runtime\ncomplexity of the approach from the objects' geometric complexity. Our approach\nis based on the As-Rigid-As-Possible (ARAP) deformation model.

The inputs to our approach are the\npoint cloud of the object's surface in its rest shape and the point cloud\ncaptured by a 3D camera in each frame. Ovearll, our approach is more broadly\napplicable than existing approaches.

Thirdly, analyzing the\ndistribution of feature words of PRC extracted by the Chi-square test and\nTF-IDF in different structures. Finally, four correlation analysis methods are\nused to analyze whether the distribution of PRC in different structures is\ncorrelated to the citations. Findings\nThe count of PRC distributed in Materials and Methods and Results section is\nsignificantly more than that in the structure of Introduction and Discussion,\nindicating that referees pay more attention to the Material and Methods and\nResults. The distribution of feature words of PRC in different structures is\nobviously different, which can reflect the content of referees' concern.

In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel method to analyze the convergence and\nstability in the training of Generative Adversarial Networks. For this purpose,\nwe propose to decompose the objective function of the adversary min-max game\ndefining a periodic GAN into its Fourier series. By studying the dynamics of\nthe truncated Fourier series for the continuous Alternating Gradient Descend\nalgorithm, we are able to approximate the real flow and to identify the main\nfeatures of the convergence of the GAN. This approach is confirmed empirically\nby studying the training flow in a $2$-parametric GAN aiming to generate an\nunknown exponential distribution. As byproduct, we show that convergent orbits\nin GANs are small perturbations of periodic orbits so the Nash equillibria are\nspiral attractors.

    "abstract": "Entity alignment aims to discover unique equivalent entity pairs with the\nsame meaning across different knowledge graphs (KG). It has been a compelling\nbut challenging task for knowledge integration or fusion. Existing models have\nprimarily focused on projecting KGs into a latent embedding space to capture\ninherent semantics between entities for entity alignment. However, the adverse\nimpacts of alignment conflicts have been largely overlooked during training,\nthus limiting the entity alignment performance. To address this issue, we\npropose a novel Conflict-aware Pseudo Labeling via Optimal Transport model\n(CPL-OT) for entity alignment. The key idea of CPL-OT is to iteratively\npseudo-label alignment pairs empowered with conflict-aware Optimal Transport\nmodeling to boost the precision of entity alignment. CPL-OT is composed of two\nkey components-entity embedding learning with global-local aggregation and\niterative conflict-aware pseudo labeling-that mutually reinforce each other. To\nmitigate alignment conflicts during pseudo labeling, we propose to use optimal\ntransport (OT) as an effective means to warrant one-to-one entity alignment\nbetween two KGs with the minimal overall transport cost. The transport cost is\ncalculated as the rectified distance between entity embeddings obtained via\ngraph convolution augmented with global-level semantics.

However, running counter to expectations,\nDNN classification models show significant, consistent, and largely unexplained\ndegradation in accuracy on these replication test datasets. While the popular\nevaluation approach is to assess the accuracy of a model by making use of all\nthe datapoints available in the respective test datasets, we argue that doing\nso hinders us from adequately capturing the behavior of DNN models and from\nhaving realistic expectations about their accuracy. Therefore, we propose a\nprincipled evaluation protocol that is suitable for performing comparative\ninvestigations of the accuracy of a DNN model on multiple test datasets,\nleveraging subsets of datapoints that can be selected using different criteria,\nincluding uncertainty-related information. By making use of this new evaluation\nprotocol, we determined the accuracy of $564$ DNN models on both (1) the\nCIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets and (2) their replication datasets. Our\nexperimental results indicate that the observed accuracy degradation between\nestablished benchmark datasets and their replications is consistently lower\n(that is, models do perform better on the replication test datasets) than the\naccuracy degradation reported in published works, with these published works\nrelying on conventional evaluation approaches that do not utilize\nuncertainty-related information.",

    "abstract": "The increasing size of HPC architectures makes the faults' presence an\neventuality more and more frequent. This is especially relevant since MPI, the\nde-facto standard for inter-process communication lacks proper fault management\nfunctionalities. The past efforts produced extensions to the MPI standard that\nenabled fault management, the most important one being ULFM. In this paper, we\nintroduce the support for non-collective communication creation\n(MPI_Comm_create_group) in ULFM to improve the fault management capabilities.\nWe integrate our solution into the Legio library and measure the overhead\nintroduced in the application. The proposed solution removes the possibility of\nturning the execution into a deadlock after a fault and can be used as an\ninspiring effort to improve the ULFM repair capabilities.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we determine the computational complexity of recognizing two\ngraph classes, grounded \\textsc{L}-graphs and stabbable grid intersection\ngraphs. An \\textsc{L}-shape is made by joining the bottom end-point of a\nvertical ($\\vert$) segment to the left end-point of a horizontal ($-$) segment.\nThe top end-point of the vertical segment is known as the {\\em anchor} of the\n\\textsc{L}-shape. Grounded \\textsc{L}-graphs are the intersection graphs of\n\\textsc{L}-shapes such that all the \\textsc{L}-shapes' anchors lie on the same\nhorizontal line. We show that recognizing grounded \\textsc{L}-graphs is\nNP-complete. This answers an open question asked by Jel{\\'\\i}nek \\& T{\\\"o}pfer\n(Electron. J.

We say that a (not necessarily axis-parallel) straight line $\\ell$\nstabs a segment $s$, if $s$ intersects $\\ell$. A graph $G$ is a stabbable grid\nintersection graph (\\textsc{StabGIG}) if there is a grid intersection\nrepresentation of $G$ in which the same line stabs all its segments.

    "title": "Leveraging Layout-based Effects for Locking Analog ICs",
    "abstract": "While various obfuscation methods exist in the digital domain, techniques for\nprotecting Intellectual Property (IP) in the analog domain are mostly\noverlooked. Understandably, analog components have a small footprint as most of\nthe surface of an Integrated Circuit (IC) is digital. Yet, since they are\nchallenging to design and tune, they constitute a valuable IP that ought to be\nprotected. This paper is the first to show a method to secure analog IP by\nexploiting layout-based effects that are typically seen as undesirable\ndetractors in IC design. Specifically, we make use of the effects of Length of\nOxide Diffusion and Well Proximity Effect on transistors for tuning the\ndevices' critical parameters (e.g., gm and Vth). Such parameters are hidden\nbehind key inputs, akin to the logic locking approach for digital ICs. The\nproposed technique is applied for locking an Operational Transconductance\nAmplifier. In order to showcase the robustness of the achieved obfuscation, the\ncase studied circuit is simulated for a large number of key sets, i.e., >50K\nand >300K, and the results show a wide range of degradation in open-loop gain\n(up to 130dB), phase margin (up to 50 deg), 3dB bandwidth (approx. 2.5MHz), and\npower (approx. 1mW) of the locked circuit when incorrect keys are applied. Our\nresults show the benefit of the technique and the incurred overheads. We also\njustify the non-effectiveness of reverse engineering efforts for attacking the\nproposed approach. More importantly, our technique employs only regular\ntransistors and requires neither changes to the IC fabrication process nor any\nfoundry-level coordination or trust.",

Both semi-supervised learning and\nactive learning can be utilised to mitigate this annotation burden. However,\nthere is limited work on combining the advantages of semi-supervised and active\nlearning approaches for multi-label medical image classification.

We apply our approach to enhance four\nleading consistency-based semi-supervised learning methods: Pseudo-labelling,\nVirtual Adversarial Training, Mean Teacher and NoTeacher. Extensive evaluations\non multi-label Chest X-Ray classification tasks demonstrate that CSEAL achieves\nsubstantive performance improvements over two leading semi-supervised active\nlearning baselines.

Feige, Kilian, and Naor (STOC 1994) and Ishai\n(Cryptology and Information Security Series 2013) constructed PSM protocols\nbased on quadratic residues. In this paper, we define QR-PSM protocols as a\ngeneralization of these protocols. A QR-PSM protocol is a PSM protocol whose\ndecoding function outputs the quadratic residuosity of what is computed from\nmessages. We design a QR-PSM protocol for any symmetric function $f: \\{0,1\\}^n\n\\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}$ of communication complexity $O(n^2)$. As far as we know,\nit is the most efficient PSM protocol since the previously known best PSM\nprotocol was of $O(n^2\\log n)$ (Beimel et al., CRYPTO 2014). We also study the\nsizes of the underlying finite fields $\\mathbb{F}_p$ in the protocols since the\ncommunication complexity of a QR-PSM protocol is proportional to the bit length\nof the prime $p$. In particular, we show that the $N$-th Peralta prime $P_N$,\nwhich is used for general QR-PSM protocols, can be taken as at most\n$(1+o(1))N^2 2^{2N-2}$, which improves the Peralta's known result (Mathematics\nof Computation 1992) by a constant factor $(1+\\sqrt{2})^2$.",

First of all, basic\nlocal binary pattern and LTP are performed to extract local textural\ninformation. Next, a subset of statistical features is extracted from\ngray-level co-occurrence matrixes.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has attracted considerable attention,\nwhich transfers knowledge from a label-rich source domain to a related but\nunlabeled target domain. Reducing inter-domain differences has always been a\ncrucial factor to improve performance in UDA, especially for tasks where there\nis a large gap between source and target domains. To this end, we propose a\nnovel style-aware feature fusion method (SAFF) to bridge the large domain gap\nand transfer knowledge while alleviating the loss of class-discriminative\ninformation. Inspired by the human transitive inference and learning ability, a\nnovel style-aware self-intermediate domain (SSID) is investigated to link two\nseemingly unrelated concepts through a series of intermediate auxiliary\nsynthesized concepts. Specifically, we propose a novel learning strategy of\nSSID, which selects samples from both source and target domains as anchors, and\nthen randomly fuses the object and style features of these anchors to generate\nlabeled and style-rich intermediate auxiliary features for knowledge transfer.\nMoreover, we design an external memory bank to store and update specified\nlabeled features to obtain stable class features and class-wise style features.\nBased on the proposed memory bank, the intra- and inter-domain loss functions\nare designed to improve the class recognition ability and feature\ncompatibility, respectively. Meanwhile, we simulate the rich latent feature\nspace of SSID by infinite sampling and the convergence of the loss function by\nmathematical theory. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on commonly\nused domain adaptive benchmarks to evaluate the proposed SAFF, and the\nexperimental results show that the proposed SAFF can be easily combined with\ndifferent backbone networks and obtain better performance as a plug-in-plug-out\nmodule.",

    "abstract": "Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments had to rapidly implement lockdown\npolicies that restricted human mobility to suppress the spread of the disease\nand reduce mortality. Because of the movement restrictions resulting from\ngovernment responses to the pandemic, US retail sales declined by -22% in April\n2020 compared to the previous year. This study looks at the stringency of\ngovernment policies, mobility patterns, and implied compliance levels. The\nrelationships between these variables and the influence on retail sales serve\nto understand past human behavior and prepare for future pandemics. Retail\nlosses varied dramatically across the US states, from -1.6% in Mississippi to\n-38.9% in Hawaii. States in the west and northeast were most affected, while\nthose in the south were relatively resilient. Regression was used to identify\nstatistically significant state-level characteristics. The greatest losses\noccurred in states with a high percentage of Democrat voters in the 2020\nPresidential Election and those with large populations. A 10% increase in the\nDemocrat vote is associated with a 2.4% increase in retail sales loss. States\nwith a high percentage of adults with less than a high school diploma were most\nresilient. The number of trips of less than one-mile per capita is defined as\nthe mobility index as it has the greatest influence on retail sales, on\naverage, across the US states. An increase of 10% in this mobility index is\nassociated with a 4.6% increase in retail sales. All states were generally\ncompliant and exhibited reduced mobility with increasing stringency. A rise of\n1% in the stringency index is associated with a decline of 1% in the mobility\nindex. States with a high percentage of Democrat voters, large populations, and\nlocated in the west tend to be most compliant.

This improves (for cores) the previous\nknown results [Dalirrooyfard-Vassilevska W.

    "abstract": "The performance of modern deep learning-based systems dramatically depends on\nthe quality of input objects. For example, face recognition quality would be\nlower for blurry or corrupted inputs. However, it is hard to predict the\ninfluence of input quality on the resulting accuracy in more complex scenarios.\nWe propose an approach for deep metric learning that allows direct estimation\nof the uncertainty with almost no additional computational cost. The developed\n\\textit{ScaleFace} algorithm uses trainable scale values that modify\nsimilarities in the space of embeddings. These input-dependent scale values\nrepresent a measure of confidence in the recognition result, thus allowing\nuncertainty estimation. We provide comprehensive experiments on face\nrecognition tasks that show the superior performance of ScaleFace compared to\nother uncertainty-aware face recognition approaches. We also extend the results\nto the task of text-to-image retrieval showing that the proposed approach beats\nthe competitors with significant margin.",

    "abstract": "One of the primary challenges in Semi-supervised Domain Adaptation (SSDA) is\nthe skewed ratio between the number of labeled source and target samples,\ncausing the model to be biased towards the source domain. Recent works in SSDA\nshow that aligning only the labeled target samples with the source samples\npotentially leads to incomplete domain alignment of the target domain to the\nsource domain. In our approach, to align the two domains, we leverage\ncontrastive losses to learn a semantically meaningful and a domain agnostic\nfeature space using the supervised samples from both domains. To mitigate\nchallenges caused by the skewed label ratio, we pseudo-label the unlabeled\ntarget samples by comparing their feature representation to those of the\nlabeled samples from both the source and target domains. Furthermore, to\nincrease the support of the target domain, these potentially noisy\npseudo-labels are gradually injected into the labeled target dataset over the\ncourse of training. Specifically, we use a temperature scaled cosine similarity\nmeasure to assign a soft pseudo-label to the unlabeled target samples.\nAdditionally, we compute an exponential moving average of the soft\npseudo-labels for each unlabeled sample. These pseudo-labels are progressively\ninjected or removed) into the (from) the labeled target dataset based on a\nconfidence threshold to supplement the alignment of the source and target\ndistributions.

Each agent consists of a\ntime-triggered inner feedback loop and a larger event-triggered outer feedback\nloop to track a formation reference signal and reject input and output noise.\nIf a local event-trigger condition is violated, the event-triggered outer\nfeedback loop is closed through the communication network.

To design the\ncontroller, a synthesis problem is formulated as a linear matrix inequality of\nthe size of a single agent under the assumption, that local estimators trigger\nintercommunication events with neighboring agents if the event-trigger\ncondition is violated. The design procedure guarantees stability and bounded\nl2-performance. Furthermore, the estimators are interchangeable for a given\ncontroller.

Time\ndelay is an inevitable phenomenon in cyber-physical systems, and has important\nimplications on controller design and trajectory generation for UAVs. The\nimpact of time delay on UAV dynamics increases with the use of the slower\nvision based navigation stack. We show that the existing models in the\nliterature, which exclude time delay, are unsuitable for controller tuning\nsince a trivial solution for minimizing an error cost functional always exists.\nThe trivial solution that we identify suggests use of infinite controller gains\nto achieve optimal performance, which contradicts practical findings. We avoid\nsuch shortcomings by introducing a novel nonlinear time delay model for UAVs,\nand then obtain a set of linear decoupled models corresponding to each of the\nUAV control loops. The cost functional of the linearized time delay model of\nangular and altitude dynamics is analyzed, and in contrast to the delay-free\nmodels, we show the existence of finite optimal controller parameters. Due to\nthe use of time delay models, we experimentally show that the proposed model\naccurately represents system stability limits.

With deep learning, the performances of face anti-spoofing (FAS) and\nrecaptured document detection have been improved significantly. However, the\nperformances are not yet satisfactory on samples with weak forensic cues. The\namount of forensic cues can be quantified to allow a reliable forensic result.\nIn this work, we propose a forensicability assessment network to quantify the\nforensicability of the questioned samples. The low-forensicability samples are\nrejected before the actual recapturing detection process to improve the\nefficiency of recapturing detection systems. We first extract forensicability\nfeatures related to both image quality assessment and forensic tasks. By\nexploiting domain knowledge of the forensic application in image quality and\nforensic features, we define three task-specific forensicability classes and\nthe initialized locations in the feature space. Based on the extracted features\nand the defined centers, we train the proposed forensic assessment network\n(FANet) with cross-entropy loss and update the centers with a momentum-based\nupdate method. We integrate the trained FANet with practical recapturing\ndetection schemes in face anti-spoofing and recaptured document detection\ntasks. Experimental results show that, for a generic CNN-based FAS scheme,\nFANet reduces the EERs from 33.75% to 19.23% under ROSE to IDIAP protocol by\nrejecting samples with the lowest 30% forensicability scores. The performance\nof FAS schemes is poor in the rejected samples, with EER as high as 56.48%.\nSimilar performances in rejecting low-forensicability samples have been\nobserved for the state-of-the-art approaches in FAS and recaptured document\ndetection tasks.

In this layer,\nthe images are classified using a ResNet18-based neural network regarding their\napplicability to the robot localization. The network is trained on a six-camera\ndataset collected in the campus of the Skolkovo Institute of Science and\nTechnology (Skoltech). For training, we use the images and ORB features that\nwere successfully matched with subsequent frame of the same camera (\"good\"\nkeypoints or features). The results have shown that the network is able to\naccurately determine the optimal images for ORB-SLAM2, and implementing the\nproposed approach in the SLAM pipeline can help significantly increase the\nnumber of images the SLAM algorithm can localize on, and improve the overall\nrobustness of visual SLAM. The experiments on operation time state that the\nproposed approach is at least 6 times faster compared to using ORB extractor\nand feature matcher when operated on CPU, and more than 30 times faster when\nrun on GPU. The network evaluation has shown at least 90% accuracy in\nrecognizing images with a big number of \"good\" ORB keypoints. The use of the\nproposed approach allowed to maintain a high number of features throughout the\ndataset by robustly switching from cameras with feature-poor streams.",

We are interested in dynamic scenarios where data is\nsampled progressively, and learning is done in an incremental rather than a\nbatch mode. We seek efficient incremental algorithms for computing feature\nimportance (FI) measures, specifically, an incremental FI measure based on\nfeature marginalization of absent features similar to permutation feature\nimportance (PFI). We propose an efficient, model-agnostic algorithm called iPFI\nto estimate this measure incrementally and under dynamic modeling conditions\nincluding concept drift. We prove theoretical guarantees on the approximation\nquality in terms of expectation and variance. To validate our theoretical\nfindings and the efficacy of our approaches compared to traditional batch PFI,\nwe conduct multiple experimental studies on benchmark data with and without\nconcept drift.",

    "abstract": "Providing quality communications under adversarial electronic attacks, e.g.,\nbroadband jamming attacks, is a challenging task. Unlike state-of-the-art\napproaches which treat jamming signals as destructive interference, this paper\npresents a novel active anti-jamming (AAJ) scheme for a jammed channel to\nenhance the communication quality between a transmitter node (TN) and receiver\nnode (RN), where the TN actively exploits the jamming signal as a carrier to\nsend messages. Specifically, the TN is equipped with a programmable-gain\namplifier, which is capable of re-modulating the jamming signals for jamming\nmodulation. Considering four typical jamming types, we derive both the bit\nerror rates (BER) and the corresponding optimal detection thresholds of the AAJ\nscheme. The asymptotic performances of the AAJ scheme are discussed under the\nhigh jamming-to-noise ratio (JNR) and sampling rate cases. Our analysis shows\nthat there exists a BER floor for sufficiently large JNR. Simulation results\nindicate that the proposed AAJ scheme allows the TN to communicate with the RN\nreliably even under extremely strong and/or broadband jamming. Additionally, we\ninvestigate the channel capacity of the proposed AAJ scheme and show that the\nchannel capacity of the AAJ scheme outperforms that of the direct transmission\nwhen the JNR is relatively high.",

To address this, we\nintroduce Model-Based Offline Options (MO2), an offline hindsight framework\nsupporting sample-efficient bottleneck option discovery over continuous\nstate-action spaces.

Some researchers propose constructing a score function that\nsatisfies the orthogonal condition, which guarantees that the established ATE\nestimator is \"orthogonal\" to be more robust. The others explore representation\nlearning models to achieve a balanced representation between the treated and\nthe controlled groups. However, existing studies fail to 1) discriminate\ntreated units from controlled ones in the representation space to avoid the\nover-balanced issue; 2) fully utilize the \"orthogonality information\". In this\npaper, we propose a moderately-balanced representation learning (MBRL)\nframework based on recent covariates balanced representation learning methods\nand orthogonal machine learning theory. This framework protects the\nrepresentation from being over-balanced via multi-task learning.\nSimultaneously, MBRL incorporates the noise orthogonality information in the\ntraining and validation stages to achieve a better ATE estimation.

In particular, it is shown that the method\nat the continuous level converges uniformly with respect to $\\varepsilon$ in\nthe standard $H^{1}$ norm, and that if the oversampling size is relatively\nlarge with respect to $\\varepsilon$ and $h$ (at the discrete level), the\nsolutions of the local reaction-diffusion equations provide good local\napproximations for the solution and thus the local eigenfunctions are not\nneeded.

    "abstract": "Many recent approaches to natural language tasks are built on the remarkable\nabilities of large language models. Large language models can perform\nin-context learning, where they learn a new task from a few task\ndemonstrations, without any parameter updates. This work examines the\nimplications of in-context learning for the creation of datasets for new\nnatural language tasks. Departing from recent in-context learning methods, we\nformulate an annotation-efficient, two-step framework: selective annotation\nthat chooses a pool of examples to annotate from unlabeled data in advance,\nfollowed by prompt retrieval that retrieves task examples from the annotated\npool at test time. Based on this framework, we propose an unsupervised,\ngraph-based selective annotation method, voke-k, to select diverse,\nrepresentative examples to annotate. Extensive experiments on 10 datasets\n(covering classification, commonsense reasoning, dialogue, and text/code\ngeneration) demonstrate that our selective annotation method improves the task\nperformance by a large margin. On average, vote-k achieves a 12.9%/11.4%\nrelative gain under an annotation budget of 18/100, as compared to randomly\nselecting examples to annotate. Compared to state-of-the-art supervised\nfinetuning approaches, it yields similar performance with 10-100x less\nannotation cost across 10 tasks. We further analyze the effectiveness of our\nframework in various scenarios: language models with varying sizes, alternative\nselective annotation methods, and cases where there is a test data domain\nshift. We hope that our studies will serve as a basis for data annotations as\nlarge language models are increasingly applied to new tasks.

    "abstract": "The rise of capturing systems for objects and scenes in 3D with increased\nfidelity and immersion has led to the popularity of volumetric video contents\nthat can be seen from any position and angle in 6 degrees of freedom\nnavigation. Such contents need large volumes of data to accurately represent\nthe real world. Thus, novel optimization solutions and delivery systems are\nneeded to enable volumetric video streaming over bandwidth-limited networks. In\nthis chapter, we discuss theoretical approaches to volumetric video streaming\noptimization, through compression solutions, as well as network and user\nadaptation, for high-end and low-powered devices. Moreover, we present an\noverview of existing end-to-end systems, and we point to the future of\nvolumetric video streaming.",

    "abstract": "Supercomputers worldwide provide the necessary infrastructure for\ngroundbreaking research. However, most supercomputers are not designed equally\ndue to different desired figure of merit, which is derived from the\ncomputational bounds of the targeted scientific applications' portfolio. In\nturn, the design of such computers becomes an optimization process that strives\nto achieve the best performances possible in a multi-parameters search space.\nTherefore, verifying and evaluating whether a supercomputer can achieve its\ndesired goal becomes a tedious and complex task. For this purpose, many full,\nmini, proxy, and benchmark applications have been introduced in the attempt to\nrepresent scientific applications. Nevertheless, as these benchmarks are hard\nto expand, and most importantly, are over-simplified compared to scientific\napplications that tend to couple multiple scientific domains, they fail to\nrepresent the true scaling capabilities. We suggest a new physical scalable\nbenchmark framework, namely ScalSALE, based on the well-known SALE scheme.\nScalSALE's main goal is to provide a simple, flexible, scalable infrastructure\nthat can be easily expanded to include multi-physical schemes while maintaining\nscalable and efficient execution times. By expanding ScalSALE, the gap between\nthe over-simplified benchmarks and scientific applications can be bridged. To\nachieve this goal, ScalSALE is implemented in Modern Fortran with simple OOP\ndesign patterns and supported by transparent MPI-3 blocking and non-blocking\ncommunication that allows such a scalable framework. ScalSALE is compared to\nLULESH via simulating the Sedov-Taylor blast wave problem using strong and weak\nscaling tests. ScalSALE is executed and evaluated with both rezoning options -\nLagrangian and Eulerian.",

    "title": "A Benchmark for Weakly Semi-Supervised Abnormality Localization in Chest  X-Rays",
    "abstract": "Accurate abnormality localization in chest X-rays (CXR) can benefit the\nclinical diagnosis of various thoracic diseases. However, the lesion-level\nannotation can only be performed by experienced radiologists, and it is tedious\nand time-consuming, thus difficult to acquire. Such a situation results in a\ndifficulty to develop a fully-supervised abnormality localization system for\nCXR. In this regard, we propose to train the CXR abnormality localization\nframework via a weakly semi-supervised strategy, termed Point Beyond Class\n(PBC), which utilizes a small number of fully annotated CXRs with lesion-level\nbounding boxes and extensive weakly annotated samples by points. Such a point\nannotation setting can provide weakly instance-level information for\nabnormality localization with a marginal annotation cost. Particularly, the\ncore idea behind our PBC is to learn a robust and accurate mapping from the\npoint annotations to the bounding boxes against the variance of annotated\npoints. To achieve that, a regularization term, namely multi-point consistency,\nis proposed, which drives the model to generate the consistent bounding box\nfrom different point annotations inside the same abnormality. Furthermore, a\nself-supervision, termed symmetric consistency, is also proposed to deeply\nexploit the useful information from the weakly annotated data for abnormality\nlocalization. Experimental results on RSNA and VinDr-CXR datasets justify the\neffectiveness of the proposed method. When less than 20% box-level labels are\nused for training, an improvement of ~5 in mAP can be achieved by our PBC,\ncompared to the current state-of-the-art method (i.e., Point DETR).

    "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used in fault diagnosis of\nmechanical systems due to their powerful feature extraction and classification\ncapabilities. However, the CNN is a typical black-box model, and the mechanism\nof CNN's decision-making are not clear, which limits its application in\nhigh-reliability-required fault diagnosis scenarios. To tackle this issue, we\npropose a novel interpretable neural network termed as Time-Frequency Network\n(TFN), where the physically meaningful time-frequency transform (TFT) method is\nembedded into the traditional convolutional layer as an adaptive preprocessing\nlayer. This preprocessing layer named as time-frequency convolutional (TFconv)\nlayer, is constrained by a well-designed kernel function to extract\nfault-related time-frequency information. It not only improves the diagnostic\nperformance but also reveals the logical foundation of the CNN prediction in\nthe frequency domain. Different TFT methods correspond to different kernel\nfunctions of the TFconv layer. In this study, four typical TFT methods are\nconsidered to formulate the TFNs and their effectiveness and interpretability\nare proved through three mechanical fault diagnosis experiments. Experimental\nresults also show that the proposed TFconv layer can be easily generalized to\nother CNNs with different depths. The code of TFN is available on\nhttps://github.com/ChenQian0618/TFN.",

    "abstract": "Using models for requirements engineering (RE) is uncommon in systems\nengineering, despite the widespread use of model-based engineering in general.\nOne reason for this lack of use is that formal models do not match well the\ntrend to move towards agile developing methods. While there exists work that\ninvestigates challenges in the adoption of requirements modeling and agile\nmethods in systems engineering, there is a lack of work studying successful\napproaches of using requirements modelling in agile systems engineering. To\naddress this gap, we conducted a case study investigating the application of\nrequirements models at Ericsson AB, a Swedish telecommunications company. We\nstudied a department using requirements models to bridge agile development and\nplan-driven development aspects. We find that models are used to understand how\nrequirements relate to each other, and to keep track with the product's\nevolution. To cope with the effort to maintain models over time, study\nparticipants suggest to rely on text-based notations that bring the models\ncloser to developers and allow integration into existing software development\nworkflows.

    "abstract": "Zero-shot learning is a learning regime that recognizes unseen classes by\ngeneralizing the visual-semantic relationship learned from the seen classes. To\nobtain an effective ZSL model, one may resort to curating training samples from\nmultiple sources, which may inevitably raise the privacy concerns about data\nsharing across different organizations. In this paper, we propose a novel\nFederated Zero-Shot Learning FedZSL framework, which learns a central model\nfrom the decentralized data residing on edge devices. To better generalize to\npreviously unseen classes, FedZSL allows the training data on each device\nsampled from the non-overlapping classes, which are far from the i.i.d. that\ntraditional federated learning commonly assumes. We identify two key challenges\nin our FedZSL protocol: 1) the trained models are prone to be biased to the\nlocally observed classes, thus failing to generalize to the unseen classes\nand/or seen classes appeared on other devices; 2) as each category in the\ntraining data comes from a single source, the central model is highly\nvulnerable to model replacement (backdoor) attacks. To address these issues, we\npropose three local objectives for visual-semantic alignment and cross-device\nalignment through relation distillation, which leverages the normalized\nclass-wise covariance to regularize the consistency of the prediction logits\nacross devices. To defend against the backdoor attacks, a feature magnitude\ndefending technique is proposed. As malicious samples are less correlated to\nthe given semantic attributes, the visual features of low magnitude will be\ndiscarded to stabilize model updates. The effectiveness and robustness of\nFedZSL are demonstrated by extensive experiments conducted on three zero-shot\nbenchmark datasets.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous agents require self-localization to navigate in unknown\nenvironments. They can use Visual Odometry (VO) to estimate self-motion and\nlocalize themselves using visual sensors. This motion-estimation strategy is\nnot compromised by drift as inertial sensors or slippage as wheel encoders.\nHowever, VO with conventional cameras is computationally demanding, limiting\nits application in systems with strict low-latency, -memory, and -energy\nrequirements. Using event-based cameras and neuromorphic computing hardware\noffers a promising low-power solution to the VO problem. However, conventional\nalgorithms for VO are not readily convertible to neuromorphic hardware. In this\nwork, we present a VO algorithm built entirely of neuronal building blocks\nsuitable for neuromorphic implementation. The building blocks are groups of\nneurons representing vectors in the computational framework of Vector Symbolic\nArchitecture (VSA) which was proposed as an abstraction layer to program\nneuromorphic hardware. The VO network we propose generates and stores a working\nmemory of the presented visual environment. It updates this working memory\nwhile at the same time estimating the changing location and orientation of the\ncamera. We demonstrate how VSA can be leveraged as a computing paradigm for\nneuromorphic robotics. Moreover, our results represent an important step\ntowards using neuromorphic computing hardware for fast and power-efficient VO\nand the related task of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM).

    "abstract": "Connectionist temporal classification (CTC) -based models are attractive\nbecause of their fast inference in automatic speech recognition (ASR). Language\nmodel (LM) integration approaches such as shallow fusion and rescoring can\nimprove the recognition accuracy of CTC-based ASR by taking advantage of the\nknowledge in text corpora. However, they significantly slow down the inference\nof CTC. In this study, we propose to distill the knowledge of BERT for\nCTC-based ASR, extending our previous study for attention-based ASR. CTC-based\nASR learns the knowledge of BERT during training and does not use BERT during\ntesting, which maintains the fast inference of CTC. Different from\nattention-based models, CTC-based models make frame-level predictions, so they\nneed to be aligned with token-level predictions of BERT for distillation. We\npropose to obtain alignments by calculating the most plausible CTC paths.\nExperimental evaluations on the Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese (CSJ) and\nTED-LIUM2 show that our method improves the performance of CTC-based ASR\nwithout the cost of inference speed.",

    "abstract": "Today, participating in discussions on online forums is extremely commonplace\nand these discussions have started rendering a strong influence on the overall\nopinion of online users. Naturally, twisting the flow of the argument can have\na strong impact on the minds of naive users, which in the long run might have\nsocio-political ramifications, for example, winning an election or spreading\ntargeted misinformation. Thus, these platforms are potentially highly\nvulnerable to malicious players who might act individually or as a cohort to\nbreed fallacious arguments with a motive to sway public opinion. Ad hominem\narguments are one of the most effective forms of such fallacies. Although a\nsimple fallacy, it is effective enough to sway public debates in offline world\nand can be used as a precursor to shutting down the voice of opposition by\nslander.\nIn this work, we take a first step in shedding light on the usage of ad\nhominem fallacies in the wild. First, we build a powerful ad hominem detector\nwith high accuracy (F1 more than 83%, showing a significant improvement over\nprior work), even for datasets for which annotated instances constitute a very\nsmall fraction. We then used our detector on 265k arguments collected from the\nonline debate forum - CreateDebate. Our crowdsourced surveys validate our\nin-the-wild predictions on CreateDebate data (94% match with manual\nannotation). Our analysis revealed that a surprising 31.23% of CreateDebate\ncontent contains ad hominem fallacy, and a cohort of highly active users post\nsignificantly more ad hominem to suppress opposing views. Then, our temporal\nanalysis revealed that ad hominem argument usage increased significantly since\nthe 2016 US Presidential election, not only for topics like Politics, but also\nfor Science and Law. We conclude by discussing important implications of our\nwork to detect and defend against ad hominem fallacies.",

    "abstract": "Fact-checking has gained increasing attention due to the widespread of\nfalsified information. Most fact-checking approaches focus on claims made in\nEnglish only due to the data scarcity issue in other languages. The lack of\nfact-checking datasets in low-resource languages calls for an effective\ncross-lingual transfer technique for fact-checking. Additionally, trustworthy\ninformation in different languages can be complementary and helpful in\nverifying facts. To this end, we present the first fact-checking framework\naugmented with cross-lingual retrieval that aggregates evidence retrieved from\nmultiple languages through a cross-lingual retriever. Given the absence of\ncross-lingual information retrieval datasets with claim-like queries, we train\nthe retriever with our proposed Cross-lingual Inverse Cloze Task (X-ICT), a\nself-supervised algorithm that creates training instances by translating the\ntitle of a passage. The goal for X-ICT is to learn cross-lingual retrieval in\nwhich the model learns to identify the passage corresponding to a given\ntranslated title.

The polyharmonic spline\n(PHS) function with appended polynomial of prescribed degree is used for\ndiscretization. A flux balance condition is satisfied at the interface points\nand the clouds of interpolation points are restricted to be within respective\ndomains. Compared with previously proposed meshless algorithms with domain\ndecomposition, the cloud-based interpolations are numerically better\nconditioned, and achieve high accuracy through the appended polynomial. The\naccuracy of the algorithm is demonstrated in several two and three dimensional\nproblems using manufactured solutions to the heat conduction equation with\nsharp discontinuity in thermal conductivity. Subsequently, we demonstrate the\napplicability of the algorithm to solve heat conduction in complex domains with\npractical boundary conditions and internal heat generation.

This is mainly\ndue to the strong ability of such networks in mining discriminative object pose\nand parts information from texture and shape. This is often inappropriate for\nfine-grained visual classification (FGVC) since it exhibits high intra-class\nand low inter-class variances due to occlusions, deformation, illuminations,\netc. Thus, an expressive feature representation describing global structural\ninformation is a key to characterize an object/ scene. To this end, we propose\na method that effectively captures subtle changes by aggregating context-aware\nfeatures from most relevant image-regions and their importance in\ndiscriminating fine-grained categories avoiding the bounding-box and/or\ndistinguishable part annotations. Our approach is inspired by the recent\nadvancement in self-attention and graph neural networks (GNNs) approaches to\ninclude a simple yet effective relation-aware feature transformation and its\nrefinement using a context-aware attention mechanism to boost the\ndiscriminability of the transformed feature in an end-to-end learning process.\nOur model is evaluated on eight benchmark datasets consisting of fine-grained\nobjects and human-object interactions. It outperforms the state-of-the-art\napproaches by a significant margin in recognition accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Catastrophic forgetting has been a significant problem hindering the\ndeployment of deep learning algorithms in the continual learning setting.\nNumerous methods have been proposed to address the catastrophic forgetting\nproblem where an agent loses its generalization power of old tasks while\nlearning new tasks. We put forward an alternative strategy to handle the\ncatastrophic forgetting with knowledge amalgamation (CFA), which learns a\nstudent network from multiple heterogeneous teacher models specializing in\nprevious tasks and can be applied to current offline methods. The knowledge\namalgamation process is carried out in a single-head manner with only a\nselected number of memorized samples and no annotations. The teachers and\nstudents do not need to share the same network structure, allowing\nheterogeneous tasks to be adapted to a compact or sparse data representation.\nWe compare our method with competitive baselines from different strategies,\ndemonstrating our approach's advantages.",

The common choice\nto measure the distance between the feature representations of the image-text\npairs is the cosine similarity, which can be considered as the negative inner\nproduct of features embedded on a sphere mathematically. While such topology\nbenefits from the low computational resources consumption and a properly\ndefined uniformity, typically, there are two major drawbacks when applied.\nFirst, it is vulnerable to the semantic ambiguity phenomenon resulting from the\nnoise in the weakly-related image-text pairs. Second, the learning progress is\nunstable and fragile at the beginning. Although, in the practice of former\nstudies, a learnable softmax temperature parameter and a long warmup scheme are\nemployed to meliorate the training progress, still there lacks an in-depth\nanalysis of these problems. In this work, we discuss the desired properties of\nthe topology and its endowed distance function for the embedding vectors of\nfeature representations from the view of optimization. We then propose a rather\nsimple solution to improve the aforementioned problem. That is, we map the\nfeature representations onto the oblique manifold endowed with the negative\ninner product as the distance function. In the experimental analysis, we show\nthat we can improve the baseline performance by a large margin (e.g. 4% in the\nzero-shot image to text retrieval task) by changing only two lines of the\ntraining codes.",

Moreover, it requires a high-level semantic understanding between the\ninput and output images since the objects in images can have arbitrary poses,\nsizes, locations, backgrounds, and self-occlusions. To tackle this problem, we\npropose utilizing facial landmark information explicitly.

We show that granular\ncompensation policies result in more efficient market outcomes than under NEM,\neven in the presence of information asymmetry, thus avoiding the need for\ninterventions.

This limits the\npossibility of generalizing existing approaches because models cannot be\ndirectly applied to new types of events or other languages. In this work, we\nstudy the task of automatically classifying messages that are related to crisis\nevents by leveraging cross-language and cross-domain labeled data. Our goal is\nto make use of labeled data from high-resource languages to classify messages\nfrom other (low-resource) languages and/or of new (previously unseen) types of\ncrisis situations. For our study we consolidated from the literature a large\nunified dataset containing multiple crisis events and languages. Our empirical\nfindings show that it is indeed possible to leverage data from crisis events in\nEnglish to classify the same type of event in other languages, such as Spanish\nand Italian (80.0% F1-score).

We make the first attempt to adapt the classical\nlocally linear embedding algorithm (LLE) -- originally designed for nonlinear\ndimensionality reduction -- for shape correspondence. The key idea is to find\ndense correspondences between shapes by first obtaining high-dimensional\nneighborhood-preserving embeddings of low-dimensional point clouds and\nsubsequently aligning the source and target embeddings using locally linear\ntransformations. We demonstrate that learning the embedding using a new\nLLE-inspired point cloud reconstruction objective results in accurate shape\ncorrespondences.

Our\napproach enforces embeddings of shapes in correspondence to lie in the same\nuniversal/canonical embedding space, which eventually helps regularize the\nlearning process and leads to a simple nearest neighbors approach between shape\nembeddings for finding reliable correspondences.

First, it introduces a geospatial data type\nthat can encode all standard spatial data types in a column format compatible\nwith Parquet. Second, it adds a new lossless and efficient encoding method,\ntermed FP-delta, that is customized to efficiently store geospatial coordinates\nstored in floating-point format. Third, it adds a light-weight spatial index\nthat allows the reader to skip non-relevant parts of the file for increased\nread efficiency. Experiments on large-scale real data showed that\nSpatialParquet can reduce the data size by a factor of three, even without\ncompression. Compression can further reduce the storage size. Additionally,\nSpatial Parquet can reduce the reading time by two orders of magnitude when the\nlight-weight index is applied. This initial prototype can open new research\ndirections to further improve geospatial data storage in column format.",

    "abstract": "Despite increasing reliance on personalization in digital platforms, many\nalgorithms that curate content or information for users have been met with\nresistance. When users feel dissatisfied or harmed by recommendations, this can\nlead users to hate, or feel negatively towards these personalized systems.\nAlgorithmic hate detrimentally impacts both users and the system, and can\nresult in various forms of algorithmic harm, or in extreme cases can lead to\npublic protests against ''the algorithm'' in question. In this work, we\nsummarize some of the most common causes of algorithmic hate and their negative\nconsequences through various case studies of personalized recommender systems.\nWe explore promising future directions for the RecSys research community that\ncould help alleviate algorithmic hate and improve the relationship between\nrecommender systems and their users.",

    "abstract": "Assistive Robotics is a class of robotics concerned with aiding humans in\ndaily care tasks that they may be inhibited from doing due to disabilities or\nage. While research has demonstrated that classical control methods can be used\nto design policies to complete these tasks, these methods can be difficult to\ngeneralize to a variety of instantiations of a task. Reinforcement learning can\nprovide a solution to this issue, wherein robots are trained in simulation and\ntheir policies are transferred to real-world machines. In this work, we\nreplicate a published baseline for training robots on three tasks in the\nAssistive Gym environment, and we explore the usage of a Recurrent Neural\nNetwork and Phasic Policy Gradient learning to augment the original work. Our\nbaseline implementation meets or exceeds the baseline of the original work,\nhowever, we found that our explorations into the new methods was not as\neffective as we anticipated. We discuss the results of our baseline, and some\nthoughts on why our new methods were not successful.",

    "title": "Transformer-CNN Cohort: Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation by the  Best of Both Students",
    "abstract": "The popular methods for semi-supervised semantic segmentation mostly adopt a\nunitary network model using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and enforce\nconsistency of the model predictions over small perturbations applied to the\ninputs or model. However, such a learning paradigm suffers from a) limited\nlearning capability of the CNN-based model; b) limited capacity of learning the\ndiscriminative features for the unlabeled data; c) limited learning for both\nglobal and local information from the whole image. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel Semi-supervised Learning approach, called Transformer-CNN Cohort (TCC),\nthat consists of two students with one based on the vision transformer (ViT)\nand the other based on the CNN. Our method subtly incorporates the multi-level\nconsistency regularization on the predictions and the heterogeneous feature\nspaces via pseudo labeling for the unlabeled data. First, as the inputs of the\nViT student are image patches, the feature maps extracted encode crucial\nclass-wise statistics. To this end, we propose class-aware feature consistency\ndistillation (CFCD) that first leverages the outputs of each student as the\npseudo labels and generates class-aware feature (CF) maps. It then transfers\nknowledge via the CF maps between the students. Second, as the ViT student has\nmore uniform representations for all layers, we propose consistency-aware cross\ndistillation to transfer knowledge between the pixel-wise predictions from the\ncohort. We validate the TCC framework on Cityscapes and Pascal VOC 2012\ndatasets, which significantly outperforms existing semi-supervised methods by a\nlarge margin.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advances in automation technologies, such as artificial\nintelligence (AI) and robotics, pose an increasing risk of automation for\noccupations, with a likely significant impact on the labour market. Recent\nsocial-economic studies suggest that nearly 50\\% of occupations are at high\nrisk of being automated in the next decade. However, the lack of granular data\nand empirically informed models have limited the accuracy of these studies and\nmade it challenging to predict which jobs will be automated. In this paper, we\nstudy the automation risk of occupations by performing a classification task\nbetween automated and non-automated occupations. The available information is\n910 occupations' task statements, skills and interactions categorised by\nStandard Occupational Classification (SOC). To fully utilize this information,\nwe propose a graph-based semi-supervised classification method named\n\\textbf{A}utomated \\textbf{O}ccupation \\textbf{C}lassification based on\n\\textbf{G}raph \\textbf{C}onvolutional \\textbf{N}etworks (\\textbf{AOC-GCN}) to\nidentify the automated risk for occupations.

    "abstract": "The vast network of bridges in the United States raises a high requirement\nfor its maintenance and rehabilitation. The massive cost of manual visual\ninspection to assess the conditions of the bridges turns out to be a burden to\nsome extent. Advanced robots have been leveraged to automate inspection data\ncollection. Automating the segmentations of multiclass elements, as well as\nsurface defects on the elements, in the large volume of inspection image data\nwould facilitate an efficient and effective assessment of the bridge condition.\nTraining separate single-task networks for element parsing (i.e., semantic\nsegmentation of multiclass elements) and defect segmentation fails to\nincorporate the close connection between these two tasks in the inspection\nimages where both recognizable structural elements and apparent surface defects\nare present. This paper is motivated to develop a multitask deep neural network\nthat fully utilizes such interdependence between bridge elements and defects to\nboost the performance and generalization of the model. Furthermore, the\neffectiveness of the proposed network designs in improving the task performance\nwas investigated, including feature decomposition, cross-talk sharing, and\nmulti-objective loss function. A dataset with pixel-level labels of bridge\nelements and corrosion was developed for training and assessment of the models.\nQuantitative and qualitative results from evaluating the developed multitask\ndeep neural network demonstrate that the recommended network outperforms the\nindependent single-task networks not only in performance (2.59% higher mIoU on\nbridge parsing and 1.65% on corrosion segmentation) but also in computational\ntime and implementation capability.",

    "title": "What to Prune and What Not to Prune at Initialization",
    "abstract": "Post-training dropout based approaches achieve high sparsity and are well\nestablished means of deciphering problems relating to computational cost and\noverfitting in Neural Network architectures. Contrastingly, pruning at\ninitialization is still far behind. Initialization pruning is more efficacious\nwhen it comes to scaling computation cost of the network. Furthermore, it\nhandles overfitting just as well as post training dropout.\nIn approbation of the above reasons, the paper presents two approaches to\nprune at initialization. The goal is to achieve higher sparsity while\npreserving performance. 1) K-starts, begins with k random p-sparse matrices at\ninitialization. In the first couple of epochs the network then determines the\n\"fittest\" of these p-sparse matrices in an attempt to find the \"lottery ticket\"\np-sparse network. The approach is adopted from how evolutionary algorithms find\nthe best individual. Depending on the Neural Network architecture, fitness\ncriteria can be based on magnitude of network weights, magnitude of gradient\naccumulation over an epoch or a combination of both. 2) Dissipating gradients\napproach, aims at eliminating weights that remain within a fraction of their\ninitial value during the first couple of epochs. Removing weights in this\nmanner despite their magnitude best preserves performance of the network.\nContrarily, the approach also takes the most epochs to achieve higher sparsity.\n3) Combination of dissipating gradients and kstarts outperforms either methods\nand random dropout consistently.\nThe benefits of using the provided pertaining approaches are: 1) They do not\nrequire specific knowledge of the classification task, fixing of dropout\nthreshold or regularization parameters 2) Retraining of the model is neither\nnecessary nor affects the performance of the p-sparse network.",

    "abstract": "Event argument extraction (EAE) has been well studied at the sentence level\nbut under-explored at the document level. In this paper, we study to capture\nevent arguments that actually spread across sentences in documents. Prior works\nmainly assume full access to rich document supervision, ignoring the fact that\nthe argument supervision is limited in documents. To fill this gap, we present\nFewDocAE, a Few-Shot Document-Level Event Argument Extraction benchmark, based\non the largest document-level event extraction dataset DocEE. We first define\nthe new problem and reconstruct the corpus by a novel N-Way-D-Doc sampling\ninstead of the traditional N-Way-K-Shot strategy. Then we adjust the advanced\ndocument-level neural models into the few-shot setting to provide baseline\nresults under in- and cross-domain settings. Since the argument extraction\ndepends on the context from multiple sentences and the learning process is\nlimited to very few examples, we find the task to be very challenging with\nsubstantively low performance. Considering FewDocAE is closely related to\npractical use under low-resource regimes, we hope this benchmark encourages\nmore research in this direction.

By designing a series of signal processing algorithms bespoke for\ndynamic vision sensing on mobile devices, EV-Tach is able to extract the\nrotational speed accurately from the event stream produced by dynamic vision\nsensing on rotary targets. According to our extensive evaluations, the Relative\nMean Absolute Error (RMAE) of EV-Tach is as low as 0.03% which is comparable to\nthe state-of-the-art laser tachometer under fixed measurement mode.

Thus, the\nexpected reward of an arm is the Shannon entropy of the probability mass\nfunction of the source that generates its symbols. The player aims to maximize\nthe expected total reward associated with the entropy values of the arms\nplayed. Under the assumption that the alphabet size is known, two UCB-based\nalgorithms are proposed for the IMAB model which consider the biases of the\nplug-in entropy estimator. The first algorithm optimistically corrects the bias\nterm in the entropy estimation. The second algorithm relies on data-dependent\nconfidence intervals that adapt to sources with small entropy values.\nPerformance guarantees are provided by upper bounding the expected regret of\neach of the algorithms. Furthermore, in the Bernoulli case, the asymptotic\nbehavior of these algorithms is compared to the Lai-Robbins lower bound for the\npseudo regret. Additionally, under the assumption that the \\textit{exact}\nalphabet size is unknown, and instead the player only knows a loose upper bound\non it, a UCB-based algorithm is proposed, in which the player aims to reduce\nthe regret caused by the unknown alphabet size in a finite time regime.\nNumerical results illustrating the expected regret of the algorithms presented\nin the paper are provided.",

This technique permits accurate calibration of the relative\nkinematics of the involved manipulators without needing high precision\nend-point sensing or force measurements, and hence it is economically\njustified. Investigating the stability of the entire real-time\nestimator/controller system reveals that the convergence and stability of the\nadaptive control process can be ensured if i) the direction of the angular\nvelocity vector does not remain constant over time, and ii) the initial\nkinematic parameter error is upper bounded by a scaler function of some known\nparameters. The adaptive controller is proved to be singularity-free even\nthough the control law involves inverting the approximation of a matrix\ncomputed at the estimated parameters.

In 2009\nJarek Duda invented his asymmetric numeral system (ANS). Apart from a beautiful\nmathematical structure, it is very efficient and offers compression with a very\nlow residual redundancy. ANS works well for any symbol source statistics.\nBesides, ANS has become a preferred compression algorithm in the IT industry.\nHowever, designing ANS instance requires a random selection of its symbol\nspread function. Consequently, each ANS instance offers compression with a\nslightly different compression rate.\nThe paper investigates compression optimality of ANS. It shows that ANS is\noptimal (i.e. the entropies of encoding and source are equal) for any symbol\nsources whose probability distribution is described by natural powers of 1/2.\nWe use Markov chains to calculate ANS state probabilities. This allows us to\ndetermine ANS compression rate precisely. We present two algorithms for finding\nANS instances with high compression rates. The first explores state probability\napproximations in order to choose ANS instances with better compression rates.\nThe second algorithm is a probabilistic one. It finds ANS instances, whose\ncompression rate can be made as close to the best rate as required. This is\ndone at the expense of the number $\\theta$ of internal random ``coin'' tosses.\nThe algorithm complexity is ${\\cal O}(\\theta L^3)$, where $L$ is the number of\nANS states. The complexity can be reduced to ${\\cal O}(\\theta L\\log{L})$ if we\nuse a fast matrix inversion.

To this end, the accurate and effective recognition of cattle\naction is a prerequisite. Generally, most existing models are confined to\nindividual behavior that uses video-based methods to extract spatial-temporal\nfeatures for recognizing the individual actions of each cattle. However, there\nis sociality among cattle and their interaction usually reflects important\nconditions, e.g. estrus, and also video-based method neglects the real-time\ncapability of the model. Based on this, we tackle the challenging task of\nreal-time recognizing interactions between cattle in a single frame in this\npaper. The pipeline of our method includes two main modules: Cattle\nLocalization Network and Interaction Recognition Network. At every moment,\ncattle localization network outputs high-quality interaction proposals from\nevery detected cattle and feeds them into the interaction recognition network\nwith a triple-stream architecture. Such a triple-stream network allows us to\nfuse different features relevant to recognizing interactions. Specifically, the\nthree kinds of features are a visual feature that extracts the appearance\nrepresentation of interaction proposals, a geometric feature that reflects the\nspatial relationship between cattle, and a semantic feature that captures our\nprior knowledge of the relationship between the individual action and\ninteraction of cattle.

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed a trend of applying context frames to boost the\nperformance of object detection as video object detection. Existing methods\nusually aggregate features at one stroke to enhance the feature. These methods,\nhowever, usually lack spatial information from neighboring frames and suffer\nfrom insufficient feature aggregation. To address the issues, we perform a\nprogressive way to introduce both temporal information and spatial information\nfor an integrated enhancement. The temporal information is introduced by the\ntemporal feature aggregation model (TFAM), by conducting an attention mechanism\nbetween the context frames and the target frame (i.e., the frame to be\ndetected). Meanwhile, we employ a Spatial Transition Awareness Model (STAM) to\nconvey the location transition information between each context frame and\ntarget frame. Built upon a transformer-based detector DETR, our PTSEFormer also\nfollows an end-to-end fashion to avoid heavy post-processing procedures while\nachieving 88.1% mAP on the ImageNet VID dataset.

However, Koopman operators are\ninfinite-dimensional, and computing their spectral information is a\nconsiderable challenge. We introduce measure-preserving extended dynamic mode\ndecomposition ($\\texttt{mpEDMD}$), the first truncation method whose\neigendecomposition converges to the spectral quantities of Koopman operators\nfor general measure-preserving dynamical systems. $\\texttt{mpEDMD}$ is a\ndata-driven algorithm based on an orthogonal Procrustes problem that enforces\nmeasure-preserving truncations of Koopman operators using a general dictionary\nof observables. It is flexible and easy to use with any pre-existing DMD-type\nmethod, and with different types of data. We prove convergence of\n$\\texttt{mpEDMD}$ for projection-valued and scalar-valued spectral measures,\nspectra, and Koopman mode decompositions.

We define the actor motion\nwith intersection-over-union (IoU) between the boxes of action tubes/tracks at\nvarious fixed time scales. The action having a large motion would result in\nlower IoU over time, and slower actions would maintain higher IoU. We find that\ntrack-aware feature aggregation consistently achieves a large improvement in\naction detection performance, especially for actions under large motion\ncompared to the cuboid-aware baseline.

In the course of analyzing these algorithms, we provide a new\nanalysis of the Stochastic Proximal Point Method (SPPM) that might be of\nindependent interest.

Influenced by the uncertainty about\nthe glass region and the varying complex scenes behind the glass, the existence\nof glass poses severe challenges to many computer vision tasks, making glass\nsegmentation as an important computer vision task. Glass does not have its own\nvisual appearances but only transmit/reflect the appearances of its\nsurroundings, making it fundamentally different from other common objects. To\naddress such a challenging task, existing methods typically explore and combine\nuseful cues from different levels of features in the deep network. As there\nexists a characteristic gap between level-different features, i.e., deep layer\nfeatures embed more high-level semantics and are better at locating the target\nobjects while shallow layer features have larger spatial sizes and keep richer\nand more detailed low-level information, fusing these features naively thus\nwould lead to a sub-optimal solution. In this paper, we approach the effective\nfeatures fusion towards accurate glass segmentation in two steps. First, we\nattempt to bridge the characteristic gap between different levels of features\nby developing a Discriminability Enhancement (DE) module which enables\nlevel-specific features to be a more discriminative representation, alleviating\nthe features incompatibility for fusion. Second, we design a\nFocus-and-Exploration Based Fusion (FEBF) module to richly excavate useful\ninformation in the fusion process by highlighting the common and exploring the\ndifference between level-different features.",

Besides, a\npipeline is designed to construct a Signalized INtersection Dataset (SIND),\nwhich contains 7 hours of recording including over 13,000 TPs with 7 types.\nThen, the behaviors of traffic light violations in SIND are recorded.\nFurthermore, the SIND is also compared with other similar works. The features\nof the SIND can be summarized as follows: 1) SIND provides more comprehensive\ninformation, including traffic light states, motion parameters, High Definition\n(HD) map, etc. 2) The category of TPs is diverse and characteristic, where the\nproportion of vulnerable road users (VRUs) is up to 62.6% 3) Multiple traffic\nlight violations of non-motor vehicles are shown. We believe that SIND would be\nan effective supplement to existing datasets and can promote related research\non autonomous driving.The dataset is available online via:\nhttps://github.com/SOTIF-AVLab/SinD",

    "abstract": "Computer systems hold a large amount of personal data over decades. On the\none hand, such data abundance allows breakthroughs in artificial intelligence\n(AI), especially machine learning (ML) models. On the other hand, it can\nthreaten the privacy of users and weaken the trust between humans and AI.\nRecent regulations require that private information about a user can be removed\nfrom computer systems in general and from ML models in particular upon request\n(e.g. the \"right to be forgotten\"). While removing data from back-end databases\nshould be straightforward, it is not sufficient in the AI context as ML models\noften \"remember\" the old data. Existing adversarial attacks proved that we can\nlearn private membership or attributes of the training data from the trained\nmodels. This phenomenon calls for a new paradigm, namely machine unlearning, to\nmake ML models forget about particular data. It turns out that recent works on\nmachine unlearning have not been able to solve the problem completely due to\nthe lack of common frameworks and resources. In this survey paper, we seek to\nprovide a thorough investigation of machine unlearning in its definitions,\nscenarios, mechanisms, and applications. Specifically, as a categorical\ncollection of state-of-the-art research, we hope to provide a broad reference\nfor those seeking a primer on machine unlearning and its various formulations,\ndesign requirements, removal requests, algorithms, and uses in a variety of ML\napplications. Furthermore, we hope to outline key findings and trends in the\nparadigm as well as highlight new areas of research that have yet to see the\napplication of machine unlearning, but could nonetheless benefit immensely. We\nhope this survey provides a valuable reference for ML researchers as well as\nthose seeking to innovate privacy technologies.

The major challenge is to suppress the mutual\ninterference between the two systems while combining the useful multi-path\ncomponents received at each system. We tackle this challenge by jointly\ndesigning the communication precoder, radar transmit waveform and receive\nfilter. Specifically, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the\nradar receiver is maximized subject to constraints on the radar waveform,\ncommunication rate and transmit power. The multi-path propagation complicates\nthe expressions of the radar SINR and communication rate, leading to a\nnon-convex problem. To solve it, a sub-optimal algorithm based on the\nalternating maximization is used to optimize the precoder, radar transmit\nwaveform and receive filter iteratively. The radar receive filter can be\nupdated by a closed-form solution. The communication precoder and radar\ntransmit waveform can be obtained by the successive convex approximation and\nalternating direction method of multipliers.

Safety and co-safety languages, where a finite prefix suffices to\nestablish whether a word does not belong or belongs to the language,\nrespectively, play a crucial role in lowering the complexity of problems like\nmodel checking and reactive synthesis for LTL. SafetyLTL (resp., coSafetyLTL)\nis a fragment of LTL where only universal (resp., existential) temporal\nmodalities are allowed, that recognises safety (resp., co-safety) languages\nonly.\nThe main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a fragment of\nS1S[FO], called SafetyFO, and of its dual coSafetyFO, which are expressively\ncomplete with respect to the LTL-definable safety and co-safety languages.

In this paper, we examine the robustness of BERTScore, one of the most\npopular embedding-based metrics for text generation.

    "abstract": "A family of $k$ point sets in $d$ dimensions is well-separated if the convex\nhulls of any two disjoint subfamilies can be separated by a hyperplane.\nWell-separation is a strong assumption that allows us to conclude that certain\nkinds of generalized ham-sandwich cuts for the point sets exist. But how hard\nis it to check if a given family of high-dimensional point sets has this\nproperty? Starting from this question, we study several algorithmic aspects of\nthe existence of transversals and separations in high-dimensions.\nFirst, we give an explicit proof that $k$ point sets are well-separated if\nand only if their convex hulls admit no $(k - 2)$-transversal, i.e., if there\nexists no $(k - 2)$-dimensional flat that intersects the convex hulls of all\n$k$ sets. It follows that the task of checking well-separation lies in the\ncomplexity class coNP. Next, we show that it is NP-hard to decide whether there\nis a hyperplane-transversal (that is, a $(d - 1)$-transversal) of a family of\n$d + 1$ line segments in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, where $d$ is part of the input. As a\nconsequence, it follows that the general problem of testing well-separation is\ncoNP-complete. Furthermore, we show that finding a hyperplane that maximizes\nthe number of intersected sets is NP-hard, but allows for an\n$\\Omega\\left(\\frac{\\log k}{k \\log \\log k}\\right)$-approximation algorithm that\nis polynomial in $d$ and $k$, when each set consists of a single point. When\nall point sets are finite, we show that checking whether there exists a $(k -\n2)$-transversal is in fact strongly NP-complete.",

    "abstract": "Object detection is the foundation of various critical computer-vision tasks\nsuch as segmentation, object tracking, and event detection. To train an object\ndetector with satisfactory accuracy, a large amount of data is required.\nHowever, due to the intensive workforce involved with annotating large\ndatasets, such a data curation task is often outsourced to a third party or\nrelied on volunteers. This work reveals severe vulnerabilities of such data\ncuration pipeline. We propose MACAB that crafts clean-annotated images to\nstealthily implant the backdoor into the object detectors trained on them even\nwhen the data curator can manually audit the images. We observe that the\nbackdoor effect of both misclassification and the cloaking are robustly\nachieved in the wild when the backdoor is activated with inconspicuously\nnatural physical triggers. Backdooring non-classification object detection with\nclean-annotation is challenging compared to backdooring existing image\nclassification tasks with clean-label, owing to the complexity of having\nmultiple objects within each frame, including victim and non-victim objects.\nThe efficacy of the MACAB is ensured by constructively i abusing the\nimage-scaling function used by the deep learning framework, ii incorporating\nthe proposed adversarial clean image replica technique, and iii combining\npoison data selection criteria given constrained attacking budget. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that MACAB exhibits more than 90% attack success rate\nunder various real-world scenes. This includes both cloaking and\nmisclassification backdoor effect even restricted with a small attack budget.\nThe poisoned samples cannot be effectively identified by state-of-the-art\ndetection techniques.The comprehensive video demo is at\nhttps://youtu.be/MA7L_LpXkp4, which is based on a poison rate of 0.14% for\nYOLOv4 cloaking backdoor and Faster R-CNN misclassification backdoor.",

Although the AI community has expanded\nthe model scale to the trillion parameter level, the practical deployment of\n10-100 billion parameter models is still uncertain due to the latency,\nthroughput, and memory constraints.\nIn this paper, we proposed EnergonAI to solve the challenges of the efficient\ndeployment of 10-100 billion parameter transformer models on single- or\nmulti-GPU systems. EnergonAI adopts a hierarchy-controller system architecture\nto coordinate multiple devices and efficiently support different parallel\npatterns.

EnergonAI enables\nthe users to program complex parallel code the same as a serial one. Compared\nwith the FasterTransformer, we have proven that EnergonAI has superior\nperformance on latency and throughput.

    "abstract": "In numerical simulations a smooth domain occupied by a fluid has to be\napproximated by a computational domain that typically does not coincide with a\nphysical domain. Consequently, in order to study convergence and error\nestimates of a numerical method domain-related discretization errors, the\nso-called variational crimes, need to be taken into account. In this paper we\npresent an elegant alternative to a direct, but rather technical, analysis of\nvariational crimes by means of the penalty approach. We embed the physical\ndomain into a large enough cubed domain and study the convergence of a finite\nvolume method for the corresponding domain-penalized problem. We show that\nnumerical solutions of the penalized problem converge to a generalized, the\nso-called dissipative weak, solution of the original problem. If a strong\nsolution exists, the dissipative weak solution emanating from the same initial\ndata coincides with the strong solution. In this case, we apply a novel tool of\nthe relative energy and derive the error estimates between the numerical\nsolution and the strong solution. Extensive numerical experiments that confirm\ntheoretical results are presented.",

    "abstract": "Spatially highly-resolved capacity expansion models are computationally\nintensive. As a result, models are often simplified to a lower spatial\nresolution by clustering multiple regions to a smaller number of\nrepresentatives. However, when capacity expansion is modeled for electricity\nsystems at a coarse resolution, the aggregation mixes sites with different\nrenewable features while removing transmission lines that can cause congestion.\nAs a consequence, the modeling results may represent an infeasible electricity\nsystem when the capacities are fed back into higher spatial detail. Thus far\nthere has been no detailed investigation of how best to dis-aggregate the\ncapacity expansion results into its original resolution and whether the\nspatially highly-resolved dis-aggregated model is technically feasible. This is\na challenge since there is no unique or obvious way to invert the clustering.\nIn this paper we proceed in two stages. First, we propose three methods to\ndis-aggregate spatially low-resolved model results into higher resolution: (a)\nuniformly distribute the regionalised results across their original set of\nregions, (b) re-optimising each clustered region separately at high resolution\n(c) a novel approach that minimises the custom \"excess electricity\" function.\nSecond, we investigate the resulting highly-resolved models' feasibility by\nrunning an operational dispatch. While re-optimising yields the lowest amounts\nof load-shedding and curtailment, our novel inverse-method provides comparable\nresults for considerably less computational effort. Feasibility-wise, our\nresults strengthen previously published research that modeling every country by\na single region is insufficient. Beyond that, we find that results obtained\nfrom state-of-the-art reduced models with 100-200 regions for Europe still\nyield 3-7% of load-shedding, depending on the model resolution and inverse\nmethod.",

In this paper, we\npropose a multimodal biometric fusion recognition algorithm based on\nfingerprints and finger veins (Fingerprint Finger Veins-Channel Spatial\nAttention Fusion Module, FPV-CSAFM). Specifically, for each pair of fingerprint\nand finger vein images, we first propose a simple and effective Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN) to extract features. Then, we build a multimodal feature\nfusion module (Channel Spatial Attention Fusion Module, CSAFM) to fully fuse\nthe complementary information between fingerprints and finger veins. Different\nfrom existing fusion strategies, our fusion method can dynamically adjust the\nfusion weights according to the importance of different modalities in channel\nand spatial dimensions, so as to better combine the information between\ndifferent modalities and improve the overall recognition performance. To\nevaluate the performance of our method, we conduct a series of experiments on\nmultiple public datasets.

Our workflow is based on training data (i.e., SMPL-X, AGORA) and\nneural networks for single-view 3D reconstruction of real humans from photos.\nWe first let a network consisting of fully connected layers estimate the depth\ncoordinate of 2D pose points. The gained 3D pose points are inputted together\nwith 2D masks of body parts into a deep implicit surface network to infer 3D\nsigned distance fields (SDFs). By assembling all body parts, we derive 2D depth\nimages and body part masks of the whole figure for different views, which are\nfed into a fully convolutional network to predict UV images. These UV images\nand the texture for the given perspective are inserted into a generative\nnetwork to inpaint the textures for the other views. Finally, the generated\ntextures are assigned to the inferred body parts in a ray marcher. We test our\nworkflow with 12 pictorial human figures after having validated several network\nconfigurations. The created 3D models look generally promising, especially when\nconsidering the challenges of silhouette-based 3D recovery and real-time\nrendering of the implicit SDFs.

In art creation, it is\nnecessary for machines to understand humans' mental states, including desires,\nappreciation, and emotions, humans also need to understand machines' creative\ncapabilities and limitations. The rapid development of immersive environment\nand further evolution into the new concept of metaverse enable symbiotic art\ncreation through unprecedented flexibility of bi-directional communication\nbetween artists and art manifestation environments.

    "title": "Autonomous Passage Planning for a Polar Vessel",
    "abstract": "We introduce a method for long-distance maritime route planning in polar\nregions, taking into account complex changing environmental conditions. The\nmethod allows the construction of optimised routes, describing the three main\nstages of the process: discrete modelling of the environmental conditions using\na non-uniform mesh, the construction of mesh-optimal paths, and path smoothing.\nIn order to account for different vehicle properties we construct a series of\ndata driven functions that can be applied to the environmental mesh to\ndetermine the speed limitations and fuel requirements for a given vessel and\nmesh cell, representing these quantities graphically and geospatially. In\ndescribing our results, we demonstrate an example use case for route planning\nfor the polar research ship the RRS Sir David Attenborough (SDA), accounting\nfor ice-performance characteristics and validating the spatial-temporal route\nconstruction in the region of the Weddell Sea, Antarctica. We demonstrate the\nversatility of this route construction method by demonstrating that routes\nchange depending on the seasonal sea ice variability, differences in the\nroute-planning objective functions used, and the presence of other\nenvironmental conditions such as currents. To demonstrate the generality of our\napproach, we present examples in the Arctic Ocean and the Baltic Sea. The\ntechniques outlined in this manuscript are generic and can therefore be applied\nto vessels with different characteristics. Our approach can have considerable\nutility beyond just a single vessel planning procedure, and we outline how this\nworkflow is applicable to a wider community, e.g. commercial and passenger\nshipping.",

Embedding a huge number\nof inter-relationships in terms of a small number of dimensions, require proper\nmodeling in both cognitive and computational aspects. Recently, numerous\nobjective functions regarding cognitive and computational aspects of natural\nlanguages are developed. Among which are the state-of-the-art methods of\nlinearity, bilinearity, manifold-preserving kernels, projection-subspace, and\nanalogical inference. However, the major challenge of such models lies in their\nloss functions that associate the dimension of relation embeddings to\ncorresponding entity dimension. This leads to inaccurate prediction of\ncorresponding relations among entities when counterparts are estimated wrongly.\nProjE KGE, published by Bordes et al., due to low computational complexity and\nhigh potential for model improvement, is improved in this work regarding all\ntranslative and bilinear interactions while capturing entity nonlinearity.\nExperimental results on benchmark Knowledge Graphs (KGs) such as FB15K and WN18\nshow that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art models in\nentity prediction task using linear and bilinear methods and other recent\npowerful ones. In addition, a parallel processing structure is proposed for the\nmodel in order to improve the scalability on large KGs.

An increasingly provoking question\nis whether such systems can outperform the single best classifier. If so, what\nform of an ensemble of classifiers (also known as multiple classifier learning\nsystems or multiple classifiers) yields the most significant benefits in the\nsize or diversity of the ensemble itself? Given that the tests used to detect\nautism traits are time-consuming and costly, developing a system that will\nprovide the best outcome and measurement of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has\nnever been critical. In this paper, several single and later multiple\nclassifiers learning systems are evaluated in terms of their ability to predict\nand identify factors that influence or contribute to ASD for early screening\npurposes. A dataset of behavioural data and robot-enhanced therapy of 3,000\nsessions and 300 hours, recorded from 61 children are utilised for this task.\nSimulation results show the superior predictive performance of multiple\nclassifier learning systems (especially those with three classifiers per\nensemble) compared to individual classifiers, with bagging and boosting\nachieving excellent results. It also appears that social communication gestures\nremain the critical contributing factor to the ASD problem among children.",

    "abstract": "Scene-text image synthesis techniques aimed at naturally composing text\ninstances on background scene images are very appealing for training deep\nneural networks because they can provide accurate and comprehensive annotation\ninformation. Prior studies have explored generating synthetic text images on\ntwo-dimensional and three-dimensional surfaces based on rules derived from\nreal-world observations. Some of these studies have proposed generating\nscene-text images from learning; however, owing to the absence of a suitable\ntraining dataset, unsupervised frameworks have been explored to learn from\nexisting real-world data, which may not result in a robust performance. To ease\nthis dilemma and facilitate research on learning-based scene text synthesis, we\npropose DecompST, a real-world dataset prepared using public benchmarks, with\nthree types of annotations: quadrilateral-level BBoxes, stroke-level text\nmasks, and text-erased images. Using the DecompST dataset, we propose an image\nsynthesis engine that includes a text location proposal network (TLPNet) and a\ntext appearance adaptation network (TAANet). TLPNet first predicts the suitable\nregions for text embedding. TAANet then adaptively changes the geometry and\ncolor of the text instance according to the context of the background.

However, these methods\nrequire sufficient labeled data which is not easy to obtain. In contrast,\nself-supervised skeleton-based action recognition has attracted more attention.\nWith utilizing the unlabeled data, more generalizable features can be learned\nto alleviate the overfitting problem and reduce the demand of massive labeled\ntraining data. Inspired by the MAE, we propose a spatial-temporal masked\nautoencoder framework for self-supervised 3D skeleton-based action recognition\n(SkeletonMAE). Following MAE's masking and reconstruction pipeline, we utilize\na skeleton based encoder-decoder transformer architecture to reconstruct the\nmasked skeleton sequences. A novel masking strategy, named Spatial-Temporal\nMasking, is introduced in terms of both joint-level and frame-level for the\nskeleton sequence. This pre-training strategy makes the encoder output\ngeneralizable skeleton features with spatial and temporal dependencies. Given\nthe unmasked skeleton sequence, the encoder is fine-tuned for the action\nrecognition task.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have achieved impressive results in many image\nclassification tasks. However, since their performance is usually measured in\ncontrolled settings, it is important to ensure that their decisions remain\ncorrect when deployed in noisy environments. In fact, deep networks are not\nrobust to a large variety of semantic-preserving image modifications, even to\nimperceptible image changes known as adversarial perturbations. The poor\nrobustness of image classifiers to small data distribution shifts raises\nserious concerns regarding their trustworthiness. To build reliable machine\nlearning models, we must design principled methods to analyze and understand\nthe mechanisms that shape robustness and invariance. This is exactly the focus\nof this thesis.\nFirst, we study the problem of computing sparse adversarial perturbations. We\nexploit the geometry of the decision boundaries of image classifiers for\ncomputing sparse perturbations very fast, and reveal a qualitative connection\nbetween adversarial examples and the data features that image classifiers\nlearn. Then, to better understand this connection, we propose a geometric\nframework that connects the distance of data samples to the decision boundary,\nwith the features existing in the data. We show that deep classifiers have a\nstrong inductive bias towards invariance to non-discriminative features, and\nthat adversarial training exploits this property to confer robustness. Finally,\nwe focus on the challenging problem of generalization to unforeseen corruptions\nof the data, and we propose a novel data augmentation scheme for achieving\nstate-of-the-art robustness to common corruptions of the images.\nOverall, our results contribute to the understanding of the fundamental\nmechanisms of deep image classifiers, and pave the way for building more\nreliable machine learning systems that can be deployed in real-world\nenvironments.",

We sought to find a way to engage users minimally,\nyet efficiently, so that they would both improve their security awareness and\nprovide necessary feedback for improvement purposes to security designers. We\nhave developed a persuasive software toolkit to engage users in structured\ndiscussions about security vulnerabilities in their company and potential\ninterventions addressing these.

    "title": "Learning an Ensemble of Deep Fingerprint Representations",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown incredible promise in learning\nfixed-length representations from fingerprints. Since the representation\nlearning is often focused on capturing specific prior knowledge (e.g.,\nminutiae), there is no universal representation that comprehensively\nencapsulates all the discriminatory information available in a fingerprint.\nWhile learning an ensemble of representations can mitigate this problem, two\ncritical challenges need to be addressed: (i) How to extract multiple diverse\nrepresentations from the same fingerprint image? and (ii) How to optimally\nexploit these representations during the matching process? In this work, we\ntrain multiple instances of DeepPrint (a state-of-the-art DNN-based fingerprint\nencoder) on different transformations of the input image to generate an\nensemble of fingerprint embeddings. We also propose a feature fusion technique\nthat distills these multiple representations into a single embedding, which\nfaithfully captures the diversity present in the ensemble without increasing\nthe computational complexity. The proposed approach has been comprehensively\nevaluated on five databases containing rolled, plain, and latent fingerprints\n(NIST SD4, NIST SD14, NIST SD27, NIST SD302, and FVC2004 DB2A) and\nstatistically significant improvements in accuracy have been consistently\ndemonstrated across a range of verification as well as closed- and open-set\nidentification settings. The proposed approach serves as a wrapper capable of\nimproving the accuracy of any DNN-based recognition system.",

    "title": "Multi-Modal Experience Inspired AI Creation",
    "abstract": "AI creation, such as poem or lyrics generation, has attracted increasing\nattention from both industry and academic communities, with many promising\nmodels proposed in the past few years. Existing methods usually estimate the\noutputs based on single and independent visual or textual information. However,\nin reality, humans usually make creations according to their experiences, which\nmay involve different modalities and be sequentially correlated. To model such\nhuman capabilities, in this paper, we define and solve a novel AI creation\nproblem based on human experiences. More specifically, we study how to generate\ntexts based on sequential multi-modal information. Compared with the previous\nworks, this task is much more difficult because the designed model has to well\nunderstand and adapt the semantics among different modalities and effectively\nconvert them into the output in a sequential manner. To alleviate these\ndifficulties, we firstly design a multi-channel sequence-to-sequence\narchitecture equipped with a multi-modal attention network. For more effective\noptimization, we then propose a curriculum negative sampling strategy tailored\nfor the sequential inputs. To benchmark this problem and demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our model, we manually labeled a new multi-modal experience\ndataset. With this dataset, we conduct extensive experiments by comparing our\nmodel with a series of representative baselines, where we can demonstrate\nsignificant improvements in our model based on both automatic and\nhuman-centered metrics.

    "abstract": "As an edge intelligence algorithm for multi-device collaborative training,\nfederated learning (FL) can reduce the communication burden but increase the\ncomputing load of wireless devices. In contrast, split learning (SL) can reduce\nthe computing load of devices by using model splitting and assignment, but\nincrease the communication burden to transmit intermediate results. In this\npaper, to exploit the advantages of FL and SL, we propose a hybrid federated\nsplit learning (HFSL) framework in wireless networks, which combines the\nmulti-worker parallel update of FL and flexible splitting of SL. To reduce the\ncomputational idleness in model splitting, we design a parallel computing\nscheme for model splitting without label sharing, and theoretically analyze the\ninfluence of the delayed gradient caused by the scheme on the convergence\nspeed. Aiming to obtain the trade-off between the training time and energy\nconsumption, we optimize the splitting decision, the bandwidth and computing\nresource allocation. The optimization problem is multi-objective, and we thus\npropose a predictive generative adversarial network (GAN)-powered\nmulti-objective optimization algorithm to obtain the Pareto front of the\nproblem. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms\nothers in finding Pareto optimal solutions, and the solutions of the proposed\nHFSL dominate the solution of FL.",

    "abstract": "Predicting the country where a picture has been taken from has many potential\napplications, like detection of false claims, impostors identification,\nprevention of disinformation campaigns, identification of fake news and so on.\nPrevious works have focused mostly on the estimation of the geo-coordinates\nwhere a picture has been taken. Yet, recognizing the country where an image has\nbeen taken could potentially be more important, from a semantic and forensic\npoint of view, than identifying its spatial coordinates. So far only a few\nworks have addressed this task, mostly by relying on images containing\ncharacteristic landmarks, like iconic monuments. In the above framework, this\npaper provides two main contributions. First, we introduce a new dataset, the\nVIPPGeo dataset, containing almost 4 million images, that can be used to train\nDL models for country classification. The dataset contains only urban images\ngiven the relevance of this kind of image for country recognition, and it has\nbeen built by paying attention to removing non-significant images, like images\nportraying faces or specific, non-relevant objects, like airplanes or ships.\nSecondly, we used the dataset to train a deep learning architecture casting the\ncountry recognition problem as a classification problem. The experiments, we\nperformed, show that our network provides significantly better results than\ncurrent state of the art. In particular, we found that asking the network to\ndirectly identify the country provides better results than estimating the\ngeo-coordinates first and then using them to trace back to the country where\nthe picture was taken.",

    "abstract": "Human pose estimation aims to figure out the keypoints of all people in\ndifferent scenes. Current approaches still face some challenges despite\npromising results. Existing top-down methods deal with a single person\nindividually, without the interaction between different people and the scene\nthey are situated in. Consequently, the performance of human detection degrades\nwhen serious occlusion happens. On the other hand, existing bottom-up methods\nconsider all people at the same time and capture the global knowledge of the\nentire image. However, they are less accurate than the top-down methods due to\nthe scale variation. To address these problems, we propose a novel\nDual-Pipeline Integrated Transformer (DPIT) by integrating top-down and\nbottom-up pipelines to explore the visual clues of different receptive fields\nand achieve their complementarity. Specifically, DPIT consists of two branches,\nthe bottom-up branch deals with the whole image to capture the global visual\ninformation, while the top-down branch extracts the feature representation of\nlocal vision from the single-human bounding box. Then, the extracted feature\nrepresentations from bottom-up and top-down branches are fed into the\ntransformer encoder to fuse the global and local knowledge interactively.\nMoreover, we define the keypoint queries to explore both full-scene and\nsingle-human posture visual clues to realize the mutual complementarity of the\ntwo pipelines. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first works to\nintegrate the bottom-up and top-down pipelines with transformers for human pose\nestimation.

Moreover, our method\nshowed increased robustness to prior misspecification and superior performance\neven when pretraining was performed on an unrelated dataset. We anticipate such\nrobustness and efficiency will make it much easier for practitioners to obtain\nexcellent results on other PU datasets of interest.

    "abstract": "ABS polar codes were recently proposed to speed up polarization by swapping\ncertain pairs of adjacent bits after each layer of polar transform. In this\npaper, we observe that applying the Arikan transform $(U_i, U_{i+1}) \\mapsto\n(U_{i}+U_{i+1}, U_{i+1})$ on certain pairs of adjacent bits after each polar\ntransform layer leads to even faster polarization.\nIn light of this, we propose ABS+ polar codes which incorporate the Arikan\ntransform in addition to the swapping transform in ABS polar codes. In order to\nefficiently construct and decode ABS+ polar codes, we derive a new recursive\nrelation between the joint distributions of adjacent bits through different\nlayers of polar transforms. Simulation results over a wide range of parameters\nshow that the CRC-aided SCL decoder of ABS+ polar codes improves upon that of\nABS polar codes by 0.1dB--0.25dB while maintaining the same decoding time.\nMoreover, ABS+ polar codes improve upon standard polar codes by 0.2dB--0.45dB\nwhen they both use the CRC-aided SCL decoder with list size $32$.

    "abstract": "The staleness problem is a well-known problem when working with dynamic data,\ndue to the absence of events for a long time. Since the memory of the node is\nupdated only when the node is involved in an event, its memory becomes stale.\nUsually, it refers to a lack of events such as a temporal deactivation of a\nsocial account. To overcome the memory staleness problem aggregate information\nfrom the nodes neighbors memory in addition to the nodes memory. Inspired by\nthat, we design an updated embedding module that inserts the most similar node\nin addition to the nodes neighbors. Our method achieved similar results to the\nTGN, with a slight improvement. This could indicate a potential improvement\nafter fine-tuning our hyper-parameters, especially the time threshold, and\nusing a learnable similarity metric.",

    "abstract": "The focus of this thesis is broadly on the alignment of lexicographical data,\nparticularly dictionaries. In order to tackle some of the challenges in this\nfield, two main tasks of word sense alignment and translation inference are\naddressed. The first task aims to find an optimal alignment given the sense\ndefinitions of a headword in two different monolingual dictionaries. This is a\nchallenging task, especially due to differences in sense granularity, coverage\nand description in two resources. After describing the characteristics of\nvarious lexical semantic resources, we introduce a benchmark containing 17\ndatasets of 15 languages where monolingual word senses and definitions are\nmanually annotated across different resources by experts. In the creation of\nthe benchmark, lexicographers' knowledge is incorporated through the\nannotations where a semantic relation, namely exact, narrower, broader, related\nor none, is selected for each sense pair. This benchmark can be used for\nevaluation purposes of word-sense alignment systems. The performance of a few\nalignment techniques based on textual and non-textual semantic similarity\ndetection and semantic relation induction is evaluated using the benchmark.\nFinally, we extend this work to translation inference where translation pairs\nare induced to generate bilingual lexicons in an unsupervised way using various\napproaches based on graph analysis. This task is of particular interest for the\ncreation of lexicographical resources for less-resourced and under-represented\nlanguages and also, assists in increasing coverage of the existing resources.\nFrom a practical point of view, the techniques and methods that are developed\nin this thesis are implemented within a tool that can facilitate the alignment\ntask.",

    "abstract": "The material point method (MPM) is frequently used to simulate large\ndeformations of nearly incompressible materials such as water, rubber, and\nundrained porous media. However, MPM solutions to nearly incompressible\nmaterials are susceptible to volumetric locking, that is, overly stiff behavior\nwith erroneous strain and stress fields. While several approaches have been\ndevised to mitigate volumetric locking in MPM, none of them lends itself to a\nstraightforward application to standard explicit MPM formulations. In this\nwork, we propose a locking-mitigation approach that features an unprecedented\ncombination of simplicity, efficacy, and generality for a family of explicit\nMPM formulations. The approach combines the assumed deformation gradient\n($\\bar{\\boldsymbol{F}}$) method with a volume-averaging operation built on\nstandard particle-grid transfer schemes in MPM. Upon explicit time integration,\nthis combination yields a new and simple algorithm for updating the deformation\ngradient, preserving all other MPM procedures. The proposed approach is thus\neasy to implement, low-cost, and compatible with the existing machinery in MPM.\nThrough various types of nearly incompressible problems in solid and fluid\nmechanics, we verify that the proposed approach efficiently circumvents\nvolumetric locking in explicit MPM, regardless of the basis functions and\nmaterial types.",

Although tensor checkpointing techniques\nhave been proposed to enable training under a restricted GPU memory budget, the\ninput tensor dynamics have been unexploited for optimizing performance while\nreducing GPU memory footprint. Specifically, due to the diverse datasets and\nsubsequent data argumentation, the input tensor size per mini-batch is dynamic\nduring the training process, leading to a changing GPU memory footprint.\nHowever, to leverage such input tensor dynamics in checkpointing, there are two\nchallenges to be solved.

Second, the checkpointing\nplan needs to be applied on the fly without significantly deteriorating the\nperformance.\nIn this paper, we propose Mimose, an input-aware tensor checkpointing planner\nrespecting the memory budget while enabling efficient model training on GPU.\nMimose builds a lightweight but accurate prediction model of GPU memory usage\nonline, without pre-analyzing the model.

    "abstract": "In multi-task learning (MTL) for visual scene understanding, it is crucial to\ntransfer useful information between multiple tasks with minimal interferences.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel architecture that effectively transfers\ninformative features by applying the attention mechanism to the multi-scale\nfeatures of the tasks. Since applying the attention module directly to all\npossible features in terms of scale and task requires a high complexity, we\npropose to apply the attention module sequentially for the task and scale. The\ncross-task attention module (CTAM) is first applied to facilitate the exchange\nof relevant information between the multiple task features of the same scale.\nThe cross-scale attention module (CSAM) then aggregates useful information from\nfeature maps at different resolutions in the same task. Also, we attempt to\ncapture long range dependencies through the self-attention module in the\nfeature extraction network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on the NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context\ndataset.",

    "abstract": "Recognizing soft-biometric pedestrian attributes is essential in video\nsurveillance and fashion retrieval. Recent works show promising results on\nsingle datasets. Nevertheless, the generalization ability of these methods\nunder different attribute distributions, viewpoints, varying illumination, and\nlow resolutions remains rarely understood due to strong biases and varying\nattributes in current datasets. To close this gap and support a systematic\ninvestigation, we present UPAR, the Unified Person Attribute Recognition\nDataset. It is based on four well-known person attribute recognition datasets:\nPA100K, PETA, RAPv2, and Market1501. We unify those datasets by providing 3,3M\nadditional annotations to harmonize 40 important binary attributes over 12\nattribute categories across the datasets. We thus enable research on\ngeneralizable pedestrian attribute recognition as well as attribute-based\nperson retrieval for the first time. Due to the vast variance of the image\ndistribution, pedestrian pose, scale, and occlusion, existing approaches are\ngreatly challenged both in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, we\ndevelop a strong baseline for PAR and attribute-based person retrieval based on\na thorough analysis of regularization methods. Our models achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance in cross-domain and specialization settings on\nPA100k, PETA, RAPv2, Market1501-Attributes, and UPAR. We believe UPAR and our\nstrong baseline will contribute to the artificial intelligence community and\npromote research on large-scale, generalizable attribute recognition systems.",

    "abstract": "3D Multi-object tracking (MOT) ensures consistency during continuous dynamic\ndetection, conducive to subsequent motion planning and navigation tasks in\nautonomous driving. However, camera-based methods suffer in the case of\nocclusions and it can be challenging to accurately track the irregular motion\nof objects for LiDAR-based methods. Some fusion methods work well but do not\nconsider the untrustworthy issue of appearance features under occlusion. At the\nsame time, the false detection problem also significantly affects tracking. As\nsuch, we propose a novel camera-LiDAR fusion 3D MOT framework based on the\nCombined Appearance-Motion Optimization (CAMO-MOT), which uses both camera and\nLiDAR data and significantly reduces tracking failures caused by occlusion and\nfalse detection. For occlusion problems, we are the first to propose an\nocclusion head to select the best object appearance features multiple times\neffectively, reducing the influence of occlusions. To decrease the impact of\nfalse detection in tracking, we design a motion cost matrix based on confidence\nscores which improve the positioning and object prediction accuracy in 3D\nspace. As existing multi-object tracking methods only consider a single\ncategory, we also propose to build a multi-category loss to implement\nmulti-object tracking in multi-category scenes. A series of validation\nexperiments are conducted on the KITTI and nuScenes tracking benchmarks. Our\nproposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance and the lowest identity\nswitches (IDS) value (23 for Car and 137 for Pedestrian) among all multi-modal\nMOT methods on the KITTI test dataset.

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning (CL) has recently been demonstrated critical in\nimproving recommendation performance. The fundamental idea of CL-based\nrecommendation models is to maximize the consistency between representations\nlearned from different graph augmentations of the user-item bipartite graph. In\nsuch a self-supervised manner, CL-based recommendation models are expected to\nextract general features from the raw data to tackle the data sparsity issue.\nDespite the effectiveness of this paradigm, we still have no clue what\nunderlies the performance gains. In this paper, we first reveal that CL\nenhances recommendation through endowing the model with the ability to learn\nmore evenly distributed user/item representations, which can implicitly\nalleviate the pervasive popularity bias and promote long-tail items. Meanwhile,\nwe find that the graph augmentations, which were considered a necessity in\nprior studies, are relatively unreliable and less significant in CL-based\nrecommendation. On top of these findings, we put forward an eXtremely Simple\nGraph Contrastive Learning method (XSimGCL) for recommendation, which discards\nthe ineffective graph augmentations and instead employs a simple yet effective\nnoise-based embedding augmentation to create views for CL. A comprehensive\nexperimental study on three large and highly sparse benchmark datasets\ndemonstrates that, though the proposed method is extremely simple, it can\nsmoothly adjust the uniformity of learned representations and outperforms its\ngraph augmentation-based counterparts by a large margin in both recommendation\naccuracy and training efficiency.

    "abstract": "We study the problem of multi-armed bandits with $\\epsilon$-global\nDifferential Privacy (DP). First, we prove the minimax and problem-dependent\nregret lower bounds for stochastic and linear bandits that quantify the\nhardness of bandits with $\\epsilon$-global DP. These bounds suggest the\nexistence of two hardness regimes depending on the privacy budget $\\epsilon$.\nIn the high-privacy regime (small $\\epsilon$), the hardness depends on a\ncoupled effect of privacy and partial information about the reward\ndistributions. In the low-privacy regime (large $\\epsilon$), bandits with\n$\\epsilon$-global DP are not harder than the bandits without privacy. For\nstochastic bandits, we further propose a generic framework to design a\nnear-optimal $\\epsilon$ global DP extension of an index-based optimistic bandit\nalgorithm. The framework consists of three ingredients: the Laplace mechanism,\narm-dependent adaptive episodes, and usage of only the rewards collected in the\nlast episode for computing private statistics. Specifically, we instantiate\n$\\epsilon$-global DP extensions of UCB and KL-UCB algorithms, namely AdaP-UCB\nand AdaP-KLUCB. AdaP-KLUCB is the first algorithm that both satisfies\n$\\epsilon$-global DP and yields a regret upper bound that matches the\nproblem-dependent lower bound up to multiplicative constants.",

    "abstract": "Third-party libraries (TPLs) are frequently reused in software to reduce\ndevelopment cost and the time to market. However, external library dependencies\nmay introduce vulnerabilities into host applications. The issue of library\ndependency has received considerable critical attention.

Moreover, a\nsignificant amount of effort has been put into studying dependencies in\nlanguage ecosystems like Java, Python, and JavaScript except C/C++. Due to the\nlack of a unified package manager for C/C++, existing research has only few\nunderstanding of TPL dependencies in the C/C++ ecosystem, especially at large\nscale.\nTowards understanding TPL dependencies in the C/C++ecosystem, we collect\nexisting TPL databases, package management tools, and dependency detection\ntools, summarize the dependency patterns of C/C++ projects, and construct a\ncomprehensive and precise C/C++ dependency detector. Using our detector, we\nextract dependencies from a large-scale database containing 24K C/C++\nrepositories from GitHub.

Avgust uses neural models for image understanding\nto process video recordings of app uses to synthesize an app-agnostic\nstate-machine encoding of those uses.

This finding has inspired us and other researchers to ask if the\nimplication also runs the other way: If CNN representations become more\nbrain-like, does the network become more accurate? Previous attempts to address\nthis question showed very modest gains in accuracy, owing in part to\nlimitations of the regularization method. To overcome these limitations, we\ndeveloped a new neural data regularizer for CNNs that uses Deep Canonical\nCorrelation Analysis (DCCA) to optimize the resemblance of the CNN's image\nrepresentations to that of the monkey visual cortex. Using this new neural data\nregularizer, we see much larger performance gains in both classification\naccuracy and within-super-class accuracy, as compared to the previous\nstate-of-the-art neural data regularizers. These networks are also more robust\nto adversarial attacks than their unregularized counterparts. Together, these\nresults confirm that neural data regularization can push CNN performance\nhigher, and introduces a new method that obtains a larger performance boost.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA), which supposes to improve text-based\nsentiment analysis with associated acoustic and visual modalities, is an\nemerging research area due to its potential applications in Human-Computer\nInteraction (HCI). However, the existing researches observe that the acoustic\nand visual modalities contribute much less than the textual modality, termed as\ntext-predominant. Under such circumstances, in this work, we emphasize making\nnon-verbal cues matter for the MSA task. Firstly, from the resource\nperspective, we present the CH-SIMS v2.0 dataset, an extension and enhancement\nof the CH-SIMS. Compared with the original dataset, the CH-SIMS v2.0 doubles\nits size with another 2121 refined video segments with both unimodal and\nmultimodal annotations and collects 10161 unlabelled raw video segments with\nrich acoustic and visual emotion-bearing context to highlight non-verbal cues\nfor sentiment prediction. Secondly, from the model perspective, benefiting from\nthe unimodal annotations and the unsupervised data in the CH-SIMS v2.0, the\nAcoustic Visual Mixup Consistent (AV-MC) framework is proposed. The designed\nmodality mixup module can be regarded as an augmentation, which mixes the\nacoustic and visual modalities from different videos. Through drawing\nunobserved multimodal context along with the text, the model can learn to be\naware of different non-verbal contexts for sentiment prediction. Our\nevaluations demonstrate that both CH-SIMS v2.0 and AV-MC framework enables\nfurther research for discovering emotion-bearing acoustic and visual cues and\npaves the path to interpretable end-to-end HCI applications for real-world\nscenarios.",

    "abstract": "Site preparation by mounding is a commonly used silvicultural treatment that\nimproves tree growth conditions by mechanically creating planting microsites\ncalled mounds. Following site preparation, the next critical step is to count\nthe number of mounds, which provides forest managers with a precise estimate of\nthe number of seedlings required for a given plantation block. Counting the\nnumber of mounds is generally conducted through manual field surveys by\nforestry workers, which is costly and prone to errors, especially for large\nareas. To address this issue, we present a novel framework exploiting advances\nin Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imaging and computer vision to accurately\nestimate the number of mounds on a planting block. The proposed framework\ncomprises two main components. First, we exploit a visual recognition method\nbased on a deep learning algorithm for multiple object detection by pixel-based\nsegmentation. This enables a preliminary count of visible mounds, as well as\nother frequently seen objects (e.g. trees, debris, accumulation of water), to\nbe used to characterize the planting block. Second, since visual recognition\ncould limited by several perturbation factors (e.g. mound erosion, occlusion),\nwe employ a machine learning estimation function that predicts the final number\nof mounds based on the local block properties extracted in the first stage. We\nevaluate the proposed framework on a new UAV dataset representing numerous\nplanting blocks with varying features. The proposed method outperformed manual\ncounting methods in terms of relative counting precision, indicating that it\nhas the potential to be advantageous and efficient in difficult situations.",

Standard versions of such learning algorithms are asynchronous,\ni.e., only one agent updates its action at each round of the learning process.\nTo enable faster learning, we propose a synchronization strategy based on\ndecentralized random prioritization of agents, which allows multiple agents to\nchange their actions simultaneously when they do not affect each other's\nutility or feasible actions.

    "abstract": "In many real-world applications, one object (e.g., image) can be represented\nor described by multiple instances (e.g., image patches) and simultaneously\nassociated with multiple labels. Such applications can be formulated as\nmulti-instance multi-label learning (MIML) problems and have been extensively\nstudied during the past few years. Existing MIML methods are useful in many\napplications but most of which suffer from relatively low accuracy and training\nefficiency due to several issues: i) the inter-label correlations (i.e., the\nprobabilistic correlations between the multiple labels corresponding to an\nobject) are neglected; ii) the inter-instance correlations cannot be learned\ndirectly (or jointly) with other types of correlations due to the missing\ninstance labels; iii) diverse inter-correlations (e.g., inter-label\ncorrelations, inter-instance correlations) can only be learned in multiple\nstages. To resolve these issues, a new single-stage framework called broad\nmulti-instance multi-label learning (BMIML) is proposed. In BMIML, there are\nthree innovative modules: i) an auto-weighted label enhancement learning\n(AWLEL) based on broad learning system (BLS); ii) A specific MIML neural\nnetwork called scalable multi-instance probabilistic regression (SMIPR); iii)\nFinally, an interactive decision optimization (IDO). As a result, BMIML can\nachieve simultaneous learning of diverse inter-correlations between whole\nimages, instances, and labels in single stage for higher classification\naccuracy and much faster training time. Experiments show that BMIML is highly\ncompetitive to (or even better than) existing methods in accuracy and much\nfaster than most MIML methods even for large medical image data sets (> 90K\nimages).",

    "abstract": "Revealing hidden dynamics from the stochastic data is a challenging problem\nas randomness takes part in the evolution of the data. The problem becomes\nexceedingly complex when the trajectories of the stochastic data are absent in\nmany scenarios. Here we present an approach to effectively modeling the\ndynamics of the stochastic data without trajectories based on the weak form of\nthe Fokker-Planck (FP) equation, which governs the evolution of the density\nfunction in the Brownian process. Taking the collocations of Gaussian functions\nas the test functions in the weak form of the FP equation, we transfer the\nderivatives to the Gaussian functions and thus approximate the weak form by the\nexpectational sum of the data. With a dictionary representation of the unknown\nterms, a linear system is built and then solved by the regression, revealing\nthe unknown dynamics of the data. Hence, we name the method with the Weak\nCollocation Regression (WCK) method for its three key components: weak form,\ncollocation of Gaussian kernels, and regression. The numerical experiments show\nthat our method is flexible and fast, which reveals the dynamics within seconds\nin multi-dimensional problems and can be easily extended to high-dimensional\ndata such as 20 dimensions. WCR can also correctly identify the hidden dynamics\nof the complex tasks with variable-dependent diffusion and coupled drift, and\nthe performance is robust, achieving high accuracy in the case with noise\nadded.",

    "abstract": "Transportation electrification requires an increasing number of electric\ncomponents (e.g., electric motors and electric energy storage systems) on\nvehicles, and control of the electric powertrains usually involves multiple\ninputs and multiple outputs (MIMO). This paper focused on the online\noptimization of energy management strategy for a multi-mode hybrid electric\nvehicle based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms that aim\nto address MIMO control optimization while most existing methods only deal with\nsingle output control. A new collaborative cyber-physical learning with\nmulti-agents is proposed based on the analysis of the evolution of energy\nefficiency of the multi-mode hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) optimized by a deep\ndeterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based MARL algorithm. Then a learning\ndriving cycle is set by a novel random method to speed up the training process.\nEventually, network design, learning rate, and policy noise are incorporated in\nthe sensibility analysis and the DDPG-based algorithm parameters are\ndetermined, and the learning performance with the different relationships of\nmulti-agents is studied and demonstrates that the not completely independent\nrelationship with Ratio 0.2 is the best. The compassion study with the\nsingle-agent and multi-agent suggests that the multi-agent can achieve\napproximately 4% improvement of total energy over the single-agent scheme.\nTherefore, the multi-objective control by MARL can achieve good optimization\neffects and application efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Context- and flow-sensitive value-flow information is an important building\nblock for many static analysis tools. Unfortunately, current approaches to\ncompute value-flows do not scale to large codebases, due to high memory and\nruntime requirements. This paper proposes a new scalable approach to compute\nvalue-flows via graph reachability. To this end, we develop a new graph\nstructure as an extension of LLVM IR that contains two additional operations\nwhich significantly simplify the modeling of pointer aliasing. Further, by\nprocessing nodes in the opposite direction of SSA def-use chains, we are able\nto minimize the tree width of the resulting graph. This allows us to employ\nefficient tree traversal algorithms in order to resolve graph reachability.\nWe present a value-flow analysis framework,DFI, implementing our approach. We\ncompare DFI against two state-of-the-art value-flow analysis frameworks, Phasar\nand SVF, to extract value-flows from 4 real-world software projects. Given 32GB\nof memory, Phasar and SVF are unable to complete analysis of larger projects\nsuch as OpenSSL or FFmpeg, while DFI is able to complete all evaluations. For\nthe subset of benchmarks that Phasar and SVF do handle, DFI requires\nsignificantly less memory (1.5% of Phasar's, 6.4% of SVF's memory footprint on\naverage) and runs significantly faster (23x speedup over Phasar, 57x compared\nto SVF).

    "abstract": "In recent years, deep learning has been widely applied in communications and\nachieved remarkable performance improvement. Most of the existing works are\nbased on data-driven deep learning, which requires a significant amount of\ntraining data for the communication model to adapt to new environments and\nresults in huge computing resources for collecting data and retraining the\nmodel. In this paper, we will significantly reduce the required amount of\ntraining data for new environments by leveraging the learning experience from\nthe known environments. Therefore, we introduce few-shot learning to enable the\ncommunication model to generalize to new environments, which is realized by an\nattention-based method. With the attention network embedded into the deep\nlearning-based communication model, environments with different power delay\nprofiles can be learnt together in the training process, which is called the\nlearning experience. By exploiting the learning experience, the communication\nmodel only requires few pilot blocks to perform well in the new environment.\nThrough an example of deep-learning-based channel estimation, we demonstrate\nthat this novel design method achieves better performance than the existing\ndata-driven approach designed for few-shot learning.",

In contrast to\nmost existing works for learning DFAs and LTL formulas, we rely on only\npositive examples. Our motivation is that negative examples are generally\ndifficult to observe, in particular, from black-box systems. To learn\nmeaningful models from positive examples only, we design algorithms that rely\non conciseness and language minimality of models as regularizers. To this end,\nour algorithms adopt two approaches: a symbolic and a counterexample-guided\none. While the symbolic approach exploits an efficient encoding of language\nminimality as a constraint satisfaction problem, the counterexample-guided one\nrelies on generating suitable negative examples to prune the search.

    "title": "Concentration of polynomial random matrices via Efron-Stein inequalities",
    "abstract": "Analyzing concentration of large random matrices is a common task in a wide\nvariety of fields. Given independent random variables, many tools are available\nto analyze random matrices whose entries are linear in the variables, e.g. the\nmatrix-Bernstein inequality. However, in many applications, we need to analyze\nrandom matrices whose entries are polynomials in the variables. These arise\nnaturally in the analysis of spectral algorithms, e.g., Hopkins et al. [STOC\n2016], Moitra-Wein [STOC 2019]; and in lower bounds for semidefinite programs\nbased on the Sum of Squares hierarchy, e.g. Barak et al. [FOCS 2016], Jones et\nal. [FOCS 2021]. In this work, we present a general framework to obtain such\nbounds, based on the matrix Efron-Stein inequalities developed by\nPaulin-Mackey-Tropp [Annals of Probability 2016]. The Efron-Stein inequality\nbounds the norm of a random matrix by the norm of another simpler (but still\nrandom) matrix, which we view as arising by \"differentiating\" the starting\nmatrix. By recursively differentiating, our framework reduces the main task to\nanalyzing far simpler matrices. For Rademacher variables, these simpler\nmatrices are in fact deterministic and hence, analyzing them is far easier. For\ngeneral non-Rademacher variables, the task reduces to scalar concentration,\nwhich is much easier. Moreover, in the setting of polynomial matrices, our\nresults generalize the work of Paulin-Mackey-Tropp. Using our basic framework,\nwe recover known bounds in the literature for simple \"tensor networks\" and\n\"dense graph matrices\". Using our general framework, we derive bounds for\n\"sparse graph matrices\", which were obtained only recently by Jones et al.\n[FOCS 2021] using a nontrivial application of the trace power method, and was a\ncore component in their work. We expect our framework to be helpful for other\napplications involving concentration phenomena for nonlinear random matrices.",

In comparison\nto PCTL*, verifying HyperPCTL* formulae is complex owing to their simultaneous\ninterpretation on multiple paths of the DTMC.

    "abstract": "Adversarial training (AT) with samples generated by Fast Gradient Sign Method\n(FGSM), also known as FGSM-AT, is a computationally simple method to train\nrobust networks. However, during its training procedure, an unstable mode of\n\"catastrophic overfitting\" has been identified in arXiv:2001.03994 [cs.LG],\nwhere the robust accuracy abruptly drops to zero within a single training step.\nExisting methods use gradient regularizers or random initialization tricks to\nattenuate this issue, whereas they either take high computational cost or lead\nto lower robust accuracy. In this work, we provide the first study, which\nthoroughly examines a collection of tricks from three perspectives: Data\nInitialization, Network Structure, and Optimization, to overcome the\ncatastrophic overfitting in FGSM-AT.\nSurprisingly, we find that simple tricks, i.e., a) masking partial pixels\n(even without randomness), b) setting a large convolution stride and smooth\nactivation functions, or c) regularizing the weights of the first convolutional\nlayer, can effectively tackle the overfitting issue.

    "abstract": "For a word $\\omega,$ we call an anagram $\\chi$ of it an anagram without fixed\nletters if the two words differ at every position. The study of anagrams\nwithout fixed letters appears in many different contexts such as combinatorics,\ntheoretical computer science, and economic theory.\nOur first direction of study is enumerative. For the word $\\omega =\n\\underbrace{11\\ldots\n1}_{x_1}\\underbrace{22\\ldots2}_{x_2}\\ldots\\underbrace{nn\\ldots n}_{x_n},$\ndenote by $\\mathsf{A}(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n)$ the number of its anagrams\nwithout fixed letters. While the function $\\mathsf{A}()$ bears significant\nimportance to economic theory, it is not known whether it can be computed in\npolynomial time even when $x_1 = \\cdots = x_n = k.$ The desire to answer\nefficiently certain queries about $\\mathsf{A}()$ motivates the study of its\ncombinatorial properties. Our first main result fully determines the parity of\n$\\mathsf{A}(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n)$ - the number is odd if and only if in the\nbinary representations of $x_1, \\ldots, x_n,$ there is an even number of ones\nat each position. Our second main result establishes that $\\mathsf{A}()$ is\nSchur-concave.These combinatorial properties lead to linear and linearithmic\nalgorithms that answer arithmetic and ordinal queries.\nOur second direction of study is structural. We introduce the anagraph, which\ngeneralizes derangement graphs. For $(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n)\\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge\n0}^n,$ the anagraph $\\mathcal{AG}(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n)$ is a graph, whose\nvertices are all words over the alphabet $[n]$ which have exactly $x_i$ letters\n$i.$ Two vertices are adjacent if they are anagrams without fixed letters of\neach other. Our main result fully determines whether an anagraph is connected.\nWe also determine when an anagraph is Eulerian. We end with a conjecture, which\nfits into the ongoing debate about the connection between hamiltonicity and\nvertex transitivity.",

Inspired by the success of transformer for natural language\nprocessing, the core idea of this preliminary study is to consider a projection\nof tomography as a word token, and the whole scan of the cross-section (A.K.A.\nsinogram) as a sentence in the context of natural language processing. Then we\nexplore the idea of foundation model by training a masked sinogram model (MSM)\nand fine-tune MSM for various downstream applications including CT\nreconstruction under data collections restriction (e.g., photon-budget) and a\ndata-driven solution to approximate solutions of the inverse problem for CT\nreconstruction.

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide. Early-stage\ndiagnosis of breast cancer can significantly improve the efficiency of\ntreatment. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems are widely adopted in this\nissue due to their reliability, accuracy and affordability. There are different\nimaging techniques for a breast cancer diagnosis; one of the most accurate ones\nis histopathology which is used in this paper. Deep feature transfer learning\nis used as the main idea of the proposed CAD system's feature extractor.\nAlthough 16 different pre-trained networks have been tested in this study, our\nmain focus is on the classification phase. The Inception-ResNet-v2 which has\nboth residual and inception networks profits together has shown the best\nfeature extraction capability in the case of breast cancer histopathology\nimages among all tested CNNs. In the classification phase, the ensemble of\nCatBoost, XGBoost and LightGBM has provided the best average accuracy. The\nBreakHis dataset was used to evaluate the proposed method. BreakHis contains\n7909 histopathology images (2,480 benign and 5,429 malignant) in four\nmagnification factors. The proposed method's accuracy (IRv2-CXL) using 70% of\nBreakHis dataset as training data in 40x, 100x, 200x and 400x magnification is\n96.82%, 95.84%, 97.01% and 96.15%, respectively. Most studies on automated\nbreast cancer detection have focused on feature extraction, which made us\nattend to the classification phase. IRv2-CXL has shown better or comparable\nresults in all magnifications due to using the soft voting ensemble method\nwhich could combine the advantages of CatBoost, XGBoost and LightGBM together.",

This assessment is complex\nto perform and associated with high variability due to the high heterogeneity\nand complexity of the disease. In this work, we tackle this issue and propose a\ndeep learning pipeline for the fully automated end-to-end analysis of\nglioblastoma patients. Our approach simultaneously identifies tumor\nsub-regions, including the enhancing tumor, peritumoral edema and surgical\ncavity in the first step, and then calculates the volumetric and bidimensional\nmeasurements that follow the current Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology\n(RANO) criteria. Also, we introduce a rigorous manual annotation process which\nwas followed to delineate the tumor sub-regions by the human experts, and to\ncapture their segmentation confidences that are later used while training the\ndeep learning models. The results of our extensive experimental study performed\nover 760 pre-operative and 504 post-operative adult patients with glioma\nobtained from the public database (acquired at 19 sites in years 2021-2020) and\nfrom a clinical treatment trial (47 and 69 sites for pre-/post-operative\npatients, 2009-2011) and backed up with thorough quantitative, qualitative and\nstatistical analysis revealed that our pipeline performs accurate segmentation\nof pre- and post-operative MRIs in a fraction of the manual delineation time\n(up to 20 times faster than humans). The bidimensional and volumetric\nmeasurements were in strong agreement with expert radiologists, and we showed\nthat RANO measurements are not always sufficient to quantify tumor burden.",

    "abstract": "Features learned from single radiologic images are unable to provide\ninformation about whether and how much a lesion may be changing over time.\nTime-dependent features computed from repeated images can capture those changes\nand help identify malignant lesions by their temporal behavior. However,\nlongitudinal medical imaging presents the unique challenge of sparse, irregular\ntime intervals in data acquisition. While self-attention has been shown to be a\nversatile and efficient learning mechanism for time series and natural images,\nits potential for interpreting temporal distance between sparse, irregularly\nsampled spatial features has not been explored. In this work, we propose two\ninterpretations of a time-distance vision transformer (ViT) by using (1) vector\nembeddings of continuous time and (2) a temporal emphasis model to scale\nself-attention weights. The two algorithms are evaluated based on benign versus\nmalignant lung cancer discrimination of synthetic pulmonary nodules and lung\nscreening computed tomography studies from the National Lung Screening Trial\n(NLST). Experiments evaluating the time-distance ViTs on synthetic nodules show\na fundamental improvement in classifying irregularly sampled longitudinal\nimages when compared to standard ViTs. In cross-validation on screening chest\nCTs from the NLST, our methods (0.785 and 0.786 AUC respectively) significantly\noutperform a cross-sectional approach (0.734 AUC) and match the discriminative\nperformance of the leading longitudinal medical imaging algorithm (0.779 AUC)\non benign versus malignant classification.

    "abstract": "Image enhancement aims at improving the aesthetic visual quality of photos by\nretouching the color and tone, and is an essential technology for professional\ndigital photography. Recent years deep learning-based image enhancement\nalgorithms have achieved promising performance and attracted increasing\npopularity. However, typical efforts attempt to construct a uniform enhancer\nfor all pixels' color transformation. It ignores the pixel differences between\ndifferent content (e.g., sky, ocean, etc.) that are significant for\nphotographs, causing unsatisfactory results. In this paper, we propose a novel\nlearnable context-aware 4-dimensional lookup table (4D LUT), which achieves\ncontent-dependent enhancement of different contents in each image via\nadaptively learning of photo context. In particular, we first introduce a\nlightweight context encoder and a parameter encoder to learn a context map for\nthe pixel-level category and a group of image-adaptive coefficients,\nrespectively. Then, the context-aware 4D LUT is generated by integrating\nmultiple basis 4D LUTs via the coefficients. Finally, the enhanced image can be\nobtained by feeding the source image and context map into fused context-aware\n4D~LUT via quadrilinear interpolation. Compared with traditional 3D LUT, i.e.,\nRGB mapping to RGB, which is usually used in camera imaging pipeline systems or\ntools, 4D LUT, i.e., RGBC(RGB+Context) mapping to RGB, enables finer control of\ncolor transformations for pixels with different content in each image, even\nthough they have the same RGB values. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nmethod outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in widely-used benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "The empirical risk minimization approach to data-driven decision making\nassumes that we can learn a decision rule from training data drawn under the\nsame conditions as the ones we want to deploy it under. However, in a number of\nsettings, we may be concerned that our training sample is biased, and that some\ngroups (characterized by either observable or unobservable attributes) may be\nunder- or over-represented relative to the general population; and in this\nsetting empirical risk minimization over the training set may fail to yield\nrules that perform well at deployment. Building on concepts from\ndistributionally robust optimization and sensitivity analysis, we propose a\nmethod for learning a decision rule that minimizes the worst-case risk incurred\nunder a family of test distributions whose conditional distributions of\noutcomes $Y$ given covariates $X$ differ from the conditional training\ndistribution by at most a constant factor, and whose covariate distributions\nare absolutely continuous with respect to the covariate distribution of the\ntraining data. We apply a result of Rockafellar and Uryasev to show that this\nproblem is equivalent to an augmented convex risk minimization problem.

The reason for the range effect is\nthat the predicted deviations both in a wide range and in a narrow range\ndestroy the uniformity between MOS and pMOS. To tackle this problem, a novel\nmethod is proposed from coarse-grained metric to fine-grained prediction.\nFirstly, we design a rank-and-gradient loss for coarse-grained metric. The loss\nkeeps the order and grad consistency between pMOS and MOS, thereby reducing the\npredicted deviation in a wide range. Secondly, we propose multi-level tolerance\nloss to make fine-grained prediction. The loss is constrained by a decreasing\nthreshold to limite the predicted deviation in narrower and narrower ranges.\nFinally, we design a feedback network to conduct the coarse-to-fine assessment.\nOn the one hand, the network adopts feedback blocks to process multi-scale\ndistortion features iteratively and on the other hand, it fuses non-local\ncontext feature to the output of each iteration to acquire more quality-aware\nfeature representation.

    "abstract": "Recently, several studies have applied deep convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) in image compressive sensing (CS) tasks to improve reconstruction\nquality. However, convolutional layers generally have a small receptive field;\ntherefore, capturing long-range pixel correlations using CNNs is challenging,\nwhich limits their reconstruction performance in image CS tasks. Considering\nthis limitation, we propose a U-shaped transformer for image CS tasks, called\nthe Uformer-ICS. We develop a projection-based transformer block by integrating\nthe prior projection knowledge of CS into the original transformer blocks, and\nthen build a symmetrical reconstruction model using the projection-based\ntransformer blocks and residual convolutional blocks. Compared with previous\nCNN-based CS methods that can only exploit local image features, the proposed\nreconstruction model can simultaneously utilize the local features and\nlong-range dependencies of an image, and the prior projection knowledge of the\nCS theory. Additionally, we design an adaptive sampling model that can\nadaptively sample image blocks based on block sparsity, which can ensure that\nthe compressed results retain the maximum possible information of the original\nimage under a fixed sampling ratio. The proposed Uformer-ICS is an end-to-end\nframework that simultaneously learns the sampling and reconstruction processes.\nExperimental results demonstrate that it achieves significantly better\nreconstruction performance than existing state-of-the-art deep learning-based\nCS methods.",

Owing to the complexity\nof modeling anomalies and the high cost of manual annotation by domain experts\n(e.g., radiologists), a typical technique in the current medical imaging\nliterature has focused on deriving diagnostic models from healthy subjects\nonly, assuming the model will detect the images from patients as outliers.\nHowever, in many real-world scenarios, unannotated datasets with a mix of both\nhealthy and diseased individuals are abundant. Therefore, this paper poses the\nresearch question of how to improve unsupervised anomaly detection by utilizing\n(1) an unannotated set of mixed images, in addition to (2) the set of healthy\nimages as being used in the literature. To answer the question, we propose\nHealthyGAN, a novel one-directional image-to-image translation method, which\nlearns to translate the images from the mixed dataset to only healthy images.\nBeing one-directional, HealthyGAN relaxes the requirement of cycle consistency\nof existing unpaired image-to-image translation methods, which is unattainable\nwith mixed unannotated data. Once the translation is learned, we generate a\ndifference map for any given image by subtracting its translated output.\nRegions of significant responses in the difference map correspond to potential\nanomalies (if any).

    "abstract": "The conflict in Ukraine is causing large-scale displacement in Europe and in\nthe World. Based on the UNHCR estimates, more than 7 million people fled the\ncountry as of 5 September 2022. In this context, it is extremely important to\nanticipate where these people are moving so that national to local authorities\ncan better manage challenges related to their reception and integration. This\nwork shows how innovative data from social media can provide useful insights on\nconflict-induced migration flows. In particular, we explore the potential of\nFacebook's Social Connectedness Index (SCI) for predicting migration flows in\nthe context of the war in Ukraine, building on previous research findings that\nthe presence of a diaspora network is one of the major migration drivers. To do\nso, we first evaluate the relationship between the Ukrainian diaspora and the\nnumber of refugees from Ukraine registered for Temporary Protection or similar\nnational schemes as a proxy of migratory flows into the EU. We find a very\nstrong correlation between the two (Pearson's $r=0.93$, $p<0.0001$), which\nindicates that the diaspora is attracting the people fleeing the war, who tend\nto reach their compatriots, in particular in the countries where the Ukrainian\nimmigration was more a recent phenomenon. Second, we compare Facebook's Social\nConnectedness Index with available official data on diaspora at regional level\nin Europe. Our results suggest that the index, along with other readily\navailable covariates, is a strong predictor of the Ukrainian diaspora at\nregional scale.

    "abstract": "Aided by advances in neural density estimation, considerable progress has\nbeen made in recent years towards a suite of simulation-based inference (SBI)\nmethods capable of performing flexible, black-box, approximate Bayesian\ninference for stochastic simulation models. While it has been demonstrated that\nneural SBI methods can provide accurate posterior approximations, the\nsimulation studies establishing these results have considered only\nwell-specified problems -- that is, where the model and the data generating\nprocess coincide exactly. However, the behaviour of such algorithms in the case\nof model misspecification has received little attention. In this work, we\nprovide the first comprehensive study of the behaviour of neural SBI algorithms\nin the presence of various forms of model misspecification. We find that\nmisspecification can have a profoundly deleterious effect on performance. Some\nmitigation strategies are explored, but no approach tested prevents failure in\nall cases. We conclude that new approaches are required to address model\nmisspecification if neural SBI algorithms are to be relied upon to derive\naccurate scientific conclusions.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel dual inexact splitting algorithm (DISA) for the\ndistributed convex composite optimization problem, where the local loss\nfunction consists of an $L$-smooth term and a possibly nonsmooth term which is\ncomposed with a linear operator. We prove that DISA is convergent when the\nprimal and dual stepsizes $\\tau$, $\\beta$ satisfy $0<\\tau<{2}/{L}$ and\n$0<\\tau\\beta <1$. Compared with existing primal-dual proximal splitting\nalgorithms (PD-PSAs), DISA overcomes the dependence of the convergence stepsize\nrange on the Euclidean norm of the linear operator. It implies that DISA allows\nfor larger stepsizes when the Euclidean norm is large, thus ensuring fast\nconvergence of it. Moreover, we establish the sublinear and linear convergence\nrate of DISA under general convexity and metric subregularity, respectively.\nFurthermore, an approximate iterative version of DISA is provided, and the\nglobal convergence and sublinear convergence rate of this approximate version\nare proved. Finally, numerical experiments not only corroborate the theoretical\nanalyses but also indicate that DISA achieves a significant acceleration\ncompared with the existing PD-PSAs.",

    "abstract": "Although being a question in the very methodological core of machine\nlearning, there is still no unanimous consensus on how to compare classifiers.\nEvery comparison framework is confronted with (at least) three fundamental\nchallenges: the multiplicity of quality criteria, the multiplicity of data sets\nand the randomness/arbitrariness of the selection of data sets. In this paper,\nwe add a fresh view to the vivid debate by adopting recent developments in\ndecision theory. Our resulting framework, based on so-called preference\nsystems, ranks classifiers by a generalized concept of stochastic dominance,\nwhich powerfully circumvents the cumbersome, and often even self-contradictory,\nreliance on aggregates. Moreover, we show that generalized stochastic dominance\ncan be operationalized by solving easy-to-handle linear programs and\nstatistically tested by means of an adapted two-sample\nobservation-randomization test. This indeed yields a powerful framework for the\nstatistical comparison of classifiers with respect to multiple quality criteria\nsimultaneously.

We propose a new precoding\ndesign that is aware of the fronthaul quantization and minimizes the\nmean-squared error at the receiver side. We compute the precoding matrix using\na sphere decoding (SD) approach. We also propose a heuristic low-complexity\napproach to quantized precoding. This heuristic is computationally efficient\nenough for massive MIMO systems. The numerical results show that our proposed\nprecoding significantly outperforms quantization-unaware precoding and other\nprevious approaches in terms of the sum rate.

The ensembles performed semantic segmentation of ice\ncrystal within a two-phase mixture, thereby tracking its phase transformation\nto water. The first ensemble (EA) is composed of U-net style networks having\ndifferent underlying architectures, whereas the second series of ensembles\n(ER-i) are composed of randomly initialized U-net style networks, wherein each\nbase learner has the same underlying architecture 'i'. The encoders of the base\nlearners were pre-trained on the Imagenet dataset. The performance of EA and ER\nwere evaluated on three different metrics: accuracy, calibration, and\nuncertainty. It is seen that EA exhibits a greater classification accuracy and\nis better calibrated, as compared to ER. While the uncertainty quantification\nof these two types of ensembles are comparable, the uncertainty scores\nexhibited by ER were found to be dependent on the specific architecture of its\nbase member ('i') and not consistently better than EA.

However due to limited training data, traditional supervised learning\nmethods often fail to generalize. Existing deep learning methods in paranasal\nanomaly classification have been used to diagnose at most one anomaly. In our\nwork, we consider three anomalies. Specifically, we employ a 3D CNN to separate\nmaxillary sinus volumes without anomalies from maxillary sinus volumes with\nanomalies. To learn robust representations from a small labelled dataset, we\npropose a novel learning paradigm that combines contrastive loss and\ncross-entropy loss. Particularly, we use a supervised contrastive loss that\nencourages embeddings of maxillary sinus volumes with and without anomaly to\nform two distinct clusters while the cross-entropy loss encourages the 3D CNN\nto maintain its discriminative ability. We report that optimising with both\nlosses is advantageous over optimising with only one loss. We also find that\nour training strategy leads to label efficiency. With our method, a 3D CNN\nclassifier achieves an AUROC of 0.85 while a 3D CNN classifier optimised with\ncross-entropy loss achieves an AUROC of 0.66.",

Most of the previous methods focus on estimating\npixel-/voxel-wise motion fields in the full image space, which ignore the fact\nthat motion estimation is mainly relevant and useful within the object of\ninterest, e.g., the heart. In this work, we model the heart as a 3D geometric\nmesh and propose a novel deep learning-based method that can estimate 3D motion\nof the heart mesh from 2D short- and long-axis CMR images.

The differentiability of the rasterizer enables us to train the\nmethod end-to-end. One advantage of the proposed method is that by tracking the\nmotion of each vertex, it is able to keep the vertex correspondence of 3D\nmeshes between time frames, which is important for quantitative assessment of\nthe cardiac function on the mesh.

    "title": "Stability of Linear Boolean Networks",
    "abstract": "Stability is an important characteristic of network models that has\nimplications for other desirable aspects such as controllability. The stability\nof a Boolean network depends on various factors, such as the topology of its\nwiring diagram and the type of the functions describing its dynamics. In this\npaper, we study the stability of linear Boolean networks by computing Derrida\ncurves and quantifying the number of attractors and cycle lengths imposed by\ntheir network topologies. Derrida curves are commonly used to measure the\nstability of Boolean networks and several parameters such as the average\nin-degree K and the output bias p can indicate if a network is stable,\ncritical, or unstable. For random unbiased Boolean networks there is a critical\nconnectivity value Kc=2 such that if K<Kc networks operate in the ordered\nregime, and if K>Kc networks operate in the chaotic regime. Here, we show that\nfor linear networks, which are the least canalizing and most unstable, the\nphase transition from order to chaos already happens at an average in-degree of\nKc=1. Consistently, we also show that unstable networks exhibit a large number\nof attractors with very long limit cycles while stable and critical networks\nexhibit fewer attractors with shorter limit cycles. Additionally, we present\ntheoretical results to quantify important dynamical properties of linear\nnetworks. First, we present a formula for the proportion of attractor states in\nlinear systems. Second, we show that the expected number of fixed points in\nlinear systems is 2, while general Boolean networks possess on average one\nfixed point. Third, we present a formula to quantify the number of bijective\nlinear Boolean networks and provide a lower bound for the percentage of this\ntype of network.",

    "title": "Fuzzy Attention Neural Network to Tackle Discontinuity in Airway  Segmentation",
    "abstract": "Airway segmentation is crucial for the examination, diagnosis, and prognosis\nof lung diseases, while its manual delineation is unduly burdensome. To\nalleviate this time-consuming and potentially subjective manual procedure,\nresearchers have proposed methods to automatically segment airways from\ncomputerized tomography (CT) images. However, some small-sized airway branches\n(e.g., bronchus and terminal bronchioles) significantly aggravate the\ndifficulty of automatic segmentation by machine learning models. In particular,\nthe variance of voxel values and the severe data imbalance in airway branches\nmake the computational module prone to discontinuous and false-negative\npredictions. Attention mechanism has shown the capacity to segment complex\nstructures, while fuzzy logic can reduce the uncertainty in feature\nrepresentations. Therefore, the integration of deep attention networks and\nfuzzy theory, given by the fuzzy attention layer, should be an escalated\nsolution. This paper presents an efficient method for airway segmentation,\ncomprising a novel fuzzy attention neural network and a comprehensive loss\nfunction to enhance the spatial continuity of airway segmentation. The deep\nfuzzy set is formulated by a set of voxels in the feature map and a learnable\nGaussian membership function. Different from the existing attention mechanism,\nthe proposed channelspecific fuzzy attention addresses the issue of\nheterogeneous features in different channels. Furthermore, a novel evaluation\nmetric is proposed to assess both the continuity and completeness of airway\nstructures. The efficiency of the proposed method has been proved by testing on\nopen datasets, including EXACT09 and LIDC datasets, and our in-house COVID-19\nand fibrotic lung disease datasets.",

    "abstract": "Ionized gas in the halo circumgalactic medium leaves an imprint on the cosmic\nmicrowave background via the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect. Feedback\nfrom active galactic nuclei (AGN) and supernovae can affect the measurements of\nthe integrated tSZ flux of halos ($Y_\\mathrm{SZ}$) and cause its relation with\nthe halo mass ($Y_\\mathrm{SZ}-M$) to deviate from the self-similar power-law\nprediction of the virial theorem. We perform a comprehensive study of such\ndeviations using CAMELS, a suite of hydrodynamic simulations with extensive\nvariations in feedback prescriptions.\nWe use a combination of two machine learning tools (random forest and\nsymbolic regression) to search for analogues of the $Y-M$ relation which are\nmore robust to feedback processes for low masses ($M\\lesssim 10^{14}\\, h^{-1}\n\\, M_\\odot$); we find that simply replacing $Y\\rightarrow\nY(1+M_*/M_\\mathrm{gas})$ in the relation makes it remarkably self-similar. This\ncould serve as a robust multiwavelength mass proxy for low-mass clusters and\ngalaxy groups. Our methodology can also be generally useful to improve the\ndomain of validity of other astrophysical scaling relations.\nWe also forecast that measurements of the $Y-M$ relation could provide\npercent-level constraints on certain combinations of feedback parameters and/or\nrule out a major part of the parameter space of supernova and AGN feedback\nmodels used in current state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations. Our results\ncan be useful for using upcoming SZ surveys (e.g. SO, CMB-S4) and galaxy\nsurveys (e.g. DESI and Rubin) to constrain the nature of baryonic feedback.\nFinally, we find that the an alternative relation, $Y-M_*$, provides\ncomplementary information on feedback than $Y-M$.",

To address instability\nin real-world scaling, we re-normalize the input of the network at the first\nlayer and balance the regularizing factors for each individual boundary.\nFinally, we illustrate the performance of our method by several numerical\nexperiments, including a 2D model with analytical solution, Arolla glacier\nmodel with real scaling and a 3D model with periodic boundary conditions.\nNumerical results show that our proposed method is efficient in solving the\nnon-Newtonian mechanics arising from glacier modeling with nonlinear rheology.",

    "abstract": "Prostate biopsy and image-guided treatment procedures are often performed\nunder the guidance of ultrasound fused with magnetic resonance images (MRI).\nAccurate image fusion relies on accurate segmentation of the prostate on\nultrasound images. Yet, the reduced signal-to-noise ratio and artifacts (e.g.,\nspeckle and shadowing) in ultrasound images limit the performance of automated\nprostate segmentation techniques and generalizing these methods to new image\ndomains is inherently difficult. In this study, we address these challenges by\nintroducing a novel 2.5D deep neural network for prostate segmentation on\nultrasound images. Our approach addresses the limitations of transfer learning\nand finetuning methods (i.e., drop in performance on the original training data\nwhen the model weights are updated) by combining a supervised domain adaptation\ntechnique and a knowledge distillation loss. The knowledge distillation loss\nallows the preservation of previously learned knowledge and reduces the\nperformance drop after model finetuning on new datasets. Furthermore, our\napproach relies on an attention module that considers model feature positioning\ninformation to improve the segmentation accuracy. We trained our model on 764\nsubjects from one institution and finetuned our model using only ten subjects\nfrom subsequent institutions. We analyzed the performance of our method on\nthree large datasets encompassing 2067 subjects from three different\ninstitutions. Our method achieved an average Dice Similarity Coefficient (Dice)\nof $94.0\\pm0.03$ and Hausdorff Distance (HD95) of 2.28 $mm$ in an independent\nset of subjects from the first institution. Moreover, our model generalized\nwell in the studies from the other two institutions (Dice: $91.0\\pm0.03$; HD95:\n3.7$mm$ and Dice: $82.0\\pm0.03$; HD95: 7.1 $mm$).",

The approach is more scalable\nto large data than Markov Chain Monte Carlo, it embraces more expressive models\nthan Variational Inference, and it does not rely on adversarial training (or\ndensity ratio estimation). We adopt the recent approach of constructing two\nmodels: (1) a primary model, tasked with performing regression or\nclassification; and (2) a secondary, expressive (e.g. implicit) model that\ndefines an approximate posterior distribution over the parameters of the\nprimary model. However, we optimise the parameters of the posterior model via\ngradient descent according to a Monte Carlo estimate of the posterior\npredictive distribution -- which is our only approximation (other than the\nposterior model). Only a likelihood needs to be specified, which can take\nvarious forms such as loss functions and synthetic likelihoods, thus providing\na form of a likelihood-free approach. Furthermore, we formulate the approach\nsuch that the posterior samples can either be independent of, or conditionally\ndependent upon the inputs to the primary model. The latter approach is shown to\nbe capable of increasing the apparent complexity of the primary model. We see\nthis being useful in applications such as surrogate and physics-based models.\nTo promote how the Bayesian paradigm offers more than just uncertainty\nquantification, we demonstrate: uncertainty quantification, multi-modality, as\nwell as an application with a recent deep forecasting neural network\narchitecture.",

However, the opposite direction, that is,\ndetermining the `distance' between an uncontrollable system to the set of\ncontrollable systems, has seldom been considered. In this paper, we address\nthis problem by defining the notion of zero-norm distance to controllability\n(ZNDC) to be the smallest number of entries (parameters) in the system matrices\nthat need to be perturbed to make the original system controllable. We show\ngenericity exists in this problem, so that other matrix norms (such as the\n$2$-norm or the Frobenius norm) adopted in this notion are nonsense. For ZNDC,\nwe show it is NP-hard to compute, even when only the state matrix can be\nperturbed. We then provide some nontrivial lower and upper bounds. For its\ncomputation, we provide two heuristic algorithms. The first one is by\ntransforming the ZNDC into a problem of structural controllability of linearly\nparameterized systems, and then greedily selecting the candidate links\naccording to a suitable objective function. The second one is based on the\nweighted $l_1$-norm relaxation and the convex-concave procedure, which is\ntailored for ZNDC when additional structural constraints are involved in the\nperturbed parameters.

    "abstract": "In the (special) smoothing spline problem one considers a variational problem\nwith a quadratic data fidelity penalty and Laplacian regularisation. Higher\norder regularity can be obtained via replacing the Laplacian regulariser with a\npoly-Laplacian regulariser. The methodology is readily adapted to graphs and\nhere we consider graph poly-Laplacian regularisation in a fully supervised,\nnon-parametric, noise corrupted, regression problem. In particular, given a\ndataset $\\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ and a set of noisy labels\n$\\{y_i\\}_{i=1}^n\\subset\\mathbb{R}$ we let $u_n:\\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^n\\to\\mathbb{R}$ be\nthe minimiser of an energy which consists of a data fidelity term and an\nappropriately scaled graph poly-Laplacian term. When $y_i = g(x_i)+\\xi_i$, for\niid noise $\\xi_i$, and using the geometric random graph, we identify (with high\nprobability) the rate of convergence of $u_n$ to $g$ in the large data limit\n$n\\to\\infty$. Furthermore, our rate, up to logarithms, coincides with the known\nrate of convergence in the usual smoothing spline model.",

    "abstract": "There is a need for computational models capable of predicting\nmeltwater-assisted crevasse growth in glacial ice. Mass loss from glaciers and\nice sheets is the largest contributor to sea-level rise and iceberg calving due\nto hydrofracture is one of the most prominent yet less understood glacial mass\nloss processes. To overcome the limitations of empirical and analytical\napproaches, we here propose a new phase field-based computational framework to\nsimulate crevasse growth in both grounded ice sheets and floating ice shelves.\nThe model incorporates the three elements needed to mechanistically simulate\nhydrofracture of surface and basal crevasses: (i) a constitutive description\nincorporating the non-linear viscous rheology of ice, (ii) a phase field\nformulation capable of capturing cracking phenomena of arbitrary complexity,\nsuch as 3D crevasse interaction, and (iii) a poro-damage representation to\naccount for the role of meltwater pressure on crevasse growth. A stress-based\nphase field model is adopted to reduce the length-scale sensitivity, as needed\nto tackle the large scales of iceberg calving, and to adequately predict\ncrevasse growth in tensile stress regions of incompressible solids. The\npotential of the computational framework presented is demonstrated by\naddressing a number of 2D and 3D case studies, involving single and multiple\ncrevasses, and considering both grounded and floating conditions. The\ncomputational framework presented opens new horizons in the modelling of\niceberg calving and, due to its ability to incorporate incompressible\nbehaviour, can be readily incorporated into numerical ice sheet models for\nprojecting sea-level rise.",

For such scenarios, two types of learning objectives\ncan be defined.

Sub-Nyquist sampling (SNS) enables digitization for\nsparse wideband spectrum without needing Nyquist speed analog-to-digital\nconverters. However, SNS demands additional signal processing algorithms for\nspectrum reconstruction, such as the well-known orthogonal matching pursuit\n(OMP) algorithm. OMP is also widely used in other compressed sensing\napplications. The first contribution of this work is efficiently mapping the\nOMP algorithm on the Zynq system-on-chip (ZSoC) consisting of an ARM processor\nand FPGA. Experimental analysis shows a significant degradation in OMP\nperformance for sparse spectrum. Also, OMP needs prior knowledge of spectrum\nsparsity. We address these challenges via deep-learning-based architectures and\nefficiently map them on the ZSoC platform as second contribution. Via\nhardware-software co-design, different versions of the proposed architecture\nobtained by partitioning between software (ARM processor) and hardware (FPGA)\nare considered. The resource, power, and execution time comparisons for given\nmemory constraints and a wide range of word lengths are presented for these\narchitectures.",
