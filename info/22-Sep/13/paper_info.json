    "abstract": "From higher computational efficiency to enabling the discovery of novel and\ncomplex structures, deep learning has emerged as a powerful framework for the\ndesign and optimization of nanophotonic circuits and components. However, both\ndata-driven and exploration-based machine learning strategies have limitations\nin their effectiveness for nanophotonic inverse design. Supervised machine\nlearning approaches require large quantities of training data to produce\nhigh-performance models and have difficulty generalizing beyond training data\ngiven the complexity of the design space. Unsupervised and reinforcement\nlearning-based approaches on the other hand can have very lengthy training or\noptimization times associated with them. Here we demonstrate a hybrid\nsupervised learning and reinforcement learning approach to the inverse design\nof nanophotonic structures and show this approach can reduce training data\ndependence, improve the generalizability of model predictions, and shorten\nexploratory training times by orders of magnitude. The presented strategy thus\naddresses a number of contemporary deep learning-based challenges, while\nopening the door for new design methodologies that leverage multiple classes of\nmachine learning algorithms to produce more effective and practical solutions\nfor photonic design.",

    "abstract": "Co-occurrent visual pattern makes context aggregation become an essential\nparadigm for semantic segmentation.The existing studies focus on modeling the\ncontexts within image while neglecting the valuable semantics of the\ncorresponding category beyond image. To this end, we propose a novel soft\nmining contextual information beyond image paradigm named MCIBI++ to further\nboost the pixel-level representations. Specifically, we first set up a\ndynamically updated memory module to store the dataset-level distribution\ninformation of various categories and then leverage the information to yield\nthe dataset-level category representations during network forward. After that,\nwe generate a class probability distribution for each pixel representation and\nconduct the dataset-level context aggregation with the class probability\ndistribution as weights. Finally, the original pixel representations are\naugmented with the aggregated dataset-level and the conventional image-level\ncontextual information. Moreover, in the inference phase, we additionally\ndesign a coarse-to-fine iterative inference strategy to further boost the\nsegmentation results. MCIBI++ can be effortlessly incorporated into the\nexisting segmentation frameworks and bring consistent performance improvements.\nAlso, MCIBI++ can be extended into the video semantic segmentation framework\nwith considerable improvements over the baseline. Equipped with MCIBI++, we\nachieved the state-of-the-art performance on seven challenging image or video\nsemantic segmentation benchmarks.",

Many current approaches simply aim to detect OOD examples and alert\nthe user when an unrecognized input is given. However, when the OOD sample\nsignificantly overlaps with the training data, a binary anomaly detection is\nnot interpretable or explainable, and provides little information to the user.\nWe propose a new model for OOD detection that makes predictions at varying\nlevels of granularity as the inputs become more ambiguous, the model\npredictions become coarser and more conservative. Consider an animal classifier\nthat encounters an unknown bird species and a car. Both cases are OOD, but the\nuser gains more information if the classifier recognizes that its uncertainty\nover the particular species is too large and predicts bird instead of detecting\nit as OOD. Furthermore, we diagnose the classifiers performance at each level\nof the hierarchy improving the explainability and interpretability of the\nmodels predictions.

Finite volume method based approximation for the space is used to\nconstruct semi-discrete form for the computation of numerical solutions. Two\ntechniques for time approximations, namely, a fully implicit (FI) and a\nsemi-implicit (SI) schemes are examined. The fully implicit scheme is\nconstructed using Newton's method and leads to the coupled system of equations\non each nonlinear and time iterations which is computationally rather\nexpensive. In order to minimize the latter hurdle, an efficient and fast\nmultiscale solver is proposed for reaction-diffusion systems in heterogeneous\nmedia. To construct fast solver, we apply a semi-implicit scheme that leads to\nan uncoupled system for each individual component. To reduce the size of the\ndiscrete system, we present a multiscale model reduction technique. Multiscale\nsolver is based on the uncoupled operator of the problem and constructed by the\nuse of Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (GMsFEM). In GMsFEM we use\na diffusion part of the operator and construct multiscale basis functions.

Such\na framework enables developers to incorporate their domain knowledge on testing\ncompilers, giving a basic program structure that allows for exploring complex\nprograms that can trigger sophisticated compiler optimizations. A developer\nwrites a template program in the host language (Java) that contains holes to be\nfilled by JAttack. Each hole, written using a domain-specific language,\nconstructs a node within an extended abstract syntax tree (eAST). An eAST node\ndefines the search space for the hole, i.e., a set of expressions and values.\nJAttack generates programs by executing templates and filling each hole by\nrandomly choosing expressions and values (available within the search space\ndefined by the hole). Additionally, we introduce several optimizations to\nreduce JAttack's generation cost. While JAttack could be used to test various\ncompiler features, we demonstrate its capabilities in helping test just-in-time\n(JIT) Java compilers, whose optimizations occur at runtime after a sufficient\nnumber of executions. Using JAttack, we have found six critical bugs that were\nconfirmed by Oracle developers. Four of them were previously unknown, including\ntwo unknown CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures).

In\nthis paper, we propose a systematic approach to characterize worst-case (i.e.,\noptimal) adversaries. We first introduce an extensible decomposition of attacks\nin adversarial machine learning by atomizing attack components into surfaces\nand travelers. With our decomposition, we enumerate over components to create\n576 attacks (568 of which were previously unexplored).

With our new attacks, we measure performance relative to the PEA\non: both robust and non-robust models, seven datasets, and three extended\nlp-based threat models incorporating compute costs, formalizing the Space of\nAdversarial Strategies. From our evaluation we find that attack performance to\nbe highly contextual: the domain, model robustness, and threat model can have a\nprofound influence on attack efficacy.

To this purpose, we included in our\nframework UDA algorithms, such as multi-level adversarial alignment and\nattentive entropy. By analyzing the challenge setting, we notice the presence\nof a secondary concurrence shift in the data, which is usually called\nenvironmental bias. It is caused by the existence of different environments,\ni.e., kitchens. To deal with these two shifts (environmental and temporal), we\nextended our system to perform Multi-Source Multi-Target Domain Adaptation.\nFinally, we employed distinct models in our final proposal to leverage the\npotential of popular video architectures, and we introduced two more losses for\nthe ensemble adaptation.

    "abstract": "Modern neural network architectures have shown remarkable success in several\nlarge-scale classification and prediction tasks. Part of the success of these\narchitectures is their flexibility to transform the data from the raw input\nrepresentations (e.g. pixels for vision tasks, or text for natural language\nprocessing tasks) to one-hot output encoding. While much of the work has\nfocused on studying how the input gets transformed to the one-hot encoding,\nvery little work has examined the effectiveness of these one-hot labels.\nIn this work, we demonstrate that more sophisticated label representations\nare better for classification than the usual one-hot encoding. We propose\nLearning with Adaptive Labels (LwAL) algorithm, which simultaneously learns the\nlabel representation while training for the classification task. These learned\nlabels can significantly cut down on the training time (usually by more than\n50%) while often achieving better test accuracies. Our algorithm introduces\nnegligible additional parameters and has a minimal computational overhead.\nAlong with improved training times, our learned labels are semantically\nmeaningful and can reveal hierarchical relationships that may be present in the\ndata.",

    "abstract": "The widespread adoption of speech-based online services raises security and\nprivacy concerns regarding the data that they use and share. If the data were\ncompromised, attackers could exploit user speech to bypass speaker verification\nsystems or even impersonate users. To mitigate this, we propose DeID-VC, a\nspeaker de-identification system that converts a real speaker to pseudo\nspeakers, thus removing or obfuscating the speaker-dependent attributes from a\nspoken voice. The key components of DeID-VC include a Variational Autoencoder\n(VAE) based Pseudo Speaker Generator (PSG) and a voice conversion Autoencoder\n(AE) under zero-shot settings. With the help of PSG, DeID-VC can assign unique\npseudo speakers at speaker level or even at utterance level. Also, two novel\nlearning objectives are added to bridge the gap between training and inference\nof zero-shot voice conversion. We present our experimental results with word\nerror rate (WER) and equal error rate (EER), along with three subjective\nmetrics to evaluate the generated output of DeID-VC. The result shows that our\nmethod substantially improved intelligibility (WER 10% lower) and\nde-identification effectiveness (EER 5% higher) compared to our baseline.

However,\nnew machine learning attacks are putting these voice authentication systems at\nrisk. Without a strong security guarantee, attackers could access legitimate\nusers' web accounts by fooling the deep neural network (DNN) based voice\nrecognition models. In this paper, we demonstrate an easy-to-implement data\npoisoning attack to the voice authentication system, which can hardly be\ncaptured by existing defense mechanisms. Thus, we propose a more robust defense\nmethod, called Guardian, which is a convolutional neural network-based\ndiscriminator. The Guardian discriminator integrates a series of novel\ntechniques including bias reduction, input augmentation, and ensemble learning.\nOur approach is able to distinguish about 95% of attacked accounts from normal\naccounts, which is much more effective than existing approaches with only 60%\naccuracy.",

    "abstract": "DNN-based frame interpolation, which generates intermediate frames from two\nconsecutive frames, is often dependent on model architectures with a large\nnumber of features, preventing their deployment on systems with limited\nresources, such as mobile devices. We present a compression-driven network\ndesign for frame interpolation that leverages model pruning through\nsparsity-inducing optimization to greatly reduce the model size while attaining\nhigher performance. Concretely, we begin by compressing the recently proposed\nAdaCoF model and demonstrating that a 10 times compressed AdaCoF performs\nsimilarly to its original counterpart, where different strategies for using\nlayerwise sparsity information as a guide are comprehensively investigated\nunder a variety of hyperparameter settings. We then enhance this compressed\nmodel by introducing a multi-resolution warping module, which improves visual\nconsistency with multi-level details. As a result, we achieve a considerable\nperformance gain with a quarter of the size of the original AdaCoF. In\naddition, our model performs favorably against other state-of-the-art\napproaches on a wide variety of datasets. We note that the suggested\ncompression-driven framework is generic and can be easily transferred to other\nDNN-based frame interpolation algorithms.

The previous solution was based on particular characteristics of\nthe (constructive, top-down) proof theory of the logic. However, that method\nintroduces some degree of non-determinism.

The most commonly used methods are the\nalgorithms designed to maximize a utility function, modularity, across\ndifferent ways that a network can be partitioned into communities. Despite\ntheir name and design philosophy, current modularity maximization algorithms\ngenerally fail to maximize modularity or guarantee any proximity to an optimal\nsolution. We propose the Bayan algorithm which, unlike the existing methods,\nreturns network partitions with a guarantee of either optimality or proximity\nto an optimal solution. At the core of the Bayan algorithm is a branch-and-cut\nscheme that solves a sparse integer programming formulation of the modularity\nmaximization problem to optimality or approximate it within a factor. We\nanalyze the performance of Bayan against 22 existing algorithms using synthetic\nand real networks. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate Bayan's\ndistinctive capabilities not only in maximizing modularity, but more\nimportantly in accurate retrieval of ground-truth communities. Bayan's\ncomparative level of performance remains stable over variations in the amount\nof noise in the data (graph) generation process. The performance of Bayan as an\nexact modularity maximization algorithm also reveals the theoretical capability\nlimits of maximum-modularity partitions in accurate retrieval of communities.\nOverall our analysis points to Bayan as a suitable choice for a\nmethodologically grounded detection of communities through exact (approximate)\nmaximization of modularity in networks with up to $\\sim10^3$ edges (and larger\nnetworks).

Specifically, first, we leverage BERT to\nvectorize the hazard and treat it as a type of time series (HTS). Secondly, we\nbuild a grey model FSGM(1, 1) to model it, and get the grey guidance in the\nsense of the structural parameters. Finally, we design a hierarchical-feature\nfusion neural network (HFFNN) to investigate the HTS with grey guidance (HTSGG)\nfrom three themes, where, HFFNN is a hierarchical structure with four types of\nmodules: two feature encoders, a gating mechanism, and a deepening mechanism.\nWe take 18 industrial processes as application cases and launch a series of\nexperiments. The experimental results prove that DLGM has promising aptitudes\nfor hazard classification and that FSGM(1, 1) and HFFNN are effective. We hope\nour research can contribute added value and support to the daily practice in\nindustrial safety.",

In recent years, the detection of melanoma using image processing\ntechniques has become a dominant research field. The Automatic Melanoma\nDetection System (AMDS) helps to detect melanoma based on image processing\ntechniques by accepting infected skin area images as input. A single lesion\nimage is a source of multiple features. Therefore, It is crucial to select the\nappropriate features from the image of the lesion in order to increase the\naccuracy of AMDS. For melanoma detection, all extracted features are not\nimportant. Some of the extracted features are complex and require more\ncomputation tasks, which impacts the classification accuracy of AMDS. The\nfeature extraction phase of AMDS exhibits more variability, therefore it is\nimportant to study the behaviour of AMDS using individual and extended feature\nextraction approaches. A novel algorithm ExtFvAMDS is proposed for the\ncalculation of Extended Feature Vector Space. The six models proposed in the\ncomparative study revealed that the HSV feature vector space for automatic\ndetection of melanoma using Ensemble Bagged Tree classifier on Med-Node Dataset\nprovided 99% AUC, 95.30% accuracy, 94.23% sensitivity, and 96.96% specificity.",

    "abstract": "Recommender systems usually learn user interests from various user behaviors,\nincluding clicks and post-click behaviors (e.g., like and favorite). However,\nthese behaviors inevitably exhibit popularity bias, leading to some unfairness\nissues: 1) for items with similar quality, more popular ones get more exposure;\nand 2) even worse the popular items with lower popularity might receive more\nexposure. Existing work on mitigating popularity bias blindly eliminates the\nbias and usually ignores the effect of item quality. We argue that the\nrelationships between different user behaviors (e.g., conversion rate) actually\nreflect the item quality. Therefore, to handle the unfairness issues, we\npropose to mitigate the popularity bias by considering multiple user behaviors.\nIn this work, we examine causal relationships behind the interaction\ngeneration procedure in multi-behavior recommendation. Specifically, we find\nthat: 1) item popularity is a confounder between the exposed items and users'\npost-click interactions, leading to the first unfairness; and 2) some hidden\nconfounders (e.g., the reputation of item producers) affect both item\npopularity and quality, resulting in the second unfairness. To alleviate these\nconfounding issues, we propose a causal framework to estimate the causal\neffect, which leverages backdoor adjustment to block the backdoor paths caused\nby the confounders. In the inference stage, we remove the negative effect of\npopularity and utilize the good effect of quality for recommendation.\nExperiments on two real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our\nproposed framework, which enhances fairness without sacrificing recommendation\naccuracy.",

Unlike chit-chat dialogue models,\ntask-oriented dialogue models fulfill at least two task-specific modules:\ndialogue state tracker (DST) and response generator (RG). The dialogue state\nconsists of the domain-slot-value triples, which are regarded as the user's\nconstraints to search the domain-related databases. The large-scale\ntask-oriented dialogue data with the annotated structured dialogue state\nusually are inaccessible. It prevents the development of the pretrained\nlanguage model for the task-oriented dialogue. We propose a simple yet\neffective pretraining method to alleviate this problem, which consists of two\npretraining phases. The first phase is to pretrain on large-scale contextual\ntext data, where the structured information of the text is extracted by the\ninformation extracting tool. To bridge the gap between the pretraining method\nand downstream tasks, we design two pretraining tasks: ontology-like triple\nrecovery and next-text generation, which simulates the DST and RG,\nrespectively. The second phase is to fine-tune the pretrained model on the TOD\ndata.

    "abstract": "Fully supervised human mesh recovery methods are data-hungry and have poor\ngeneralizability due to the limited availability and diversity of 3D-annotated\nbenchmark datasets. Recent progress in self-supervised human mesh recovery has\nbeen made using synthetic-data-driven training paradigms where the model is\ntrained from synthetic paired 2D representation (e.g., 2D keypoints and\nsegmentation masks) and 3D mesh. However, on synthetic dense correspondence\nmaps (i.e., IUV) few have been explored since the domain gap between synthetic\ntraining data and real testing data is hard to address for 2D dense\nrepresentation. To alleviate this domain gap on IUV, we propose\ncross-representation alignment utilizing the complementary information from the\nrobust but sparse representation (2D keypoints). Specifically, the alignment\nerrors between initial mesh estimation and both 2D representations are\nforwarded into regressor and dynamically corrected in the following mesh\nregression. This adaptive cross-representation alignment explicitly learns from\nthe deviations and captures complementary information: robustness from sparse\nrepresentation and richness from dense representation.

    "abstract": "Food delivery systems are gaining popularity recently due to the expansion of\ninternet connectivity and for the increasing availability of devices. The\ngrowing popularity of such systems has raised concerns regarding (i)\nInformation security, (ii) Business to business (B2B) deep discounting race,\nand (iii) Strict policy enforcement. Sensitive personal data and financial\ninformation of the users must be safeguarded. Additionally, in pursuit of\ngaining profit, the restaurants tend to offer deep discounts resulting in a\nhigher volume of orders than usual. Therefore, the restaurants and the delivery\npersons fail to maintain the delivery time and often impair the food quality.\nIn this paper, we have proposed a blockchain and smart contract-based food\ndelivery system to address these issues. The main goal is to remove commission\nschemes and decrease service delays caused by a high volume of orders. The\nprotocols have been deployed and tested on the Ethereum test network. The\nsimulation manifests a successful implementation of our desired system; with\nthe payment being controlled by our system. The actors (restaurant,\ndelivery-person or consumer) are bound to be compliant with the policies or\npenalized otherwise.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies self-sustained dynamic multiagent systems (MAS) for\ndecentralized resource allocation operating at a competitive equilibrium over a\nfinite horizon. The utility of resource consumption, along with the income from\nresource exchange, forms each agent's payoff which is aimed to be maximized.\nEach utility function is parameterized by individual preferences which can be\ndesigned by agents independently. By shaping these preferences and proposing a\nset of utility functions, we can guarantee that the optimal resource price at\nthe competitive equilibrium always remains socially acceptable, i.e., it never\nviolates a given threshold that indicates affordability. First, we show this\nproblem is solvable at the conceptual level under some convexity assumptions.\nThen, as a benchmark case, we consider quadratic MAS and formulate the\nassociated social shaping problem as a multi-agent LQR problem which enables us\nto propose explicit utility sets using quadratic programming and dynamic\nprogramming.

Diagnosis of this disorder\nin the early phases of the disease is a vital task to rescue patients lives\nfrom bad consequences and provide them with better healthcare. Machine learning\nmethods have been proven to be accurate in predicting dementia in the early\nphases of the disease. The prediction of dementia depends heavily on the type\nof collected data which usually are gathered from Normalized Whole Brain Volume\n(nWBV) and Atlas Scaling Factor (ASF) which are normally measured and corrected\nfrom Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRIs). Other biological features such as age\nand gender can also help in the diagnosis of dementia. Although many studies\nuse machine learning for predicting dementia, we could not reach a conclusion\non the stability of these methods for which one is more accurate under\ndifferent experimental conditions. Therefore, this paper investigates the\nconclusion stability regarding the performance of machine learning algorithms\nfor dementia prediction. To accomplish this, a large number of experiments were\nrun using 7 machine learning algorithms and two feature reduction algorithms\nnamely, Information Gain (IG) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). To\nexamine the stability of these algorithms, thresholds of feature selection were\nchanged for the IG from 20% to 100% and the PCA dimension from 2 to 8. This has\nresulted in 7x9 + 7x7= 112 experiments. In each experiment, various\nclassification evaluation data were recorded. The obtained results show that\namong seven algorithms the support vector machine and Naive Bayes are the most\nstable algorithms while changing the selection threshold.

This can be provided by a reputation system that processes\nratings to provide recommendations. The rating aggregation process is a main\npart of reputation system to produce global opinion about the product quality.\nNaive methods that are frequently used do not consider consumer profiles in its\ncalculation and cannot discover unfair ratings and trends emerging in new\nratings. Other sophisticated rating aggregation methods that use weighted\naverage technique focus on one or a few aspects of consumers profile data. This\npaper proposes a new reputation system using machine learning to predict\nreliability of consumers from consumer profile. In particular, we construct a\nnew consumer profile dataset by extracting a set of factors that have great\nimpact on consumer reliability, which serve as an input to machine learning\nalgorithms. The predicted weight is then integrated with a weighted average\nmethod to compute product reputation score.

    "abstract": "We consider the budgeted matroid independent set problem. The input is a\nground set, where each element has a cost and a non-negative profit, along with\na matroid over the elements and a budget. The goal is to select a subset of\nelements which maximizes the total profit subject to the matroid and budget\nconstraints. Several well known special cases, where we have, e.g., a uniform\nmatroid and a budget, or no matroid constraint (i.e., the classic knapsack\nproblem), admit a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS). In\ncontrast, already a slight generalization to the multi-budgeted matroid\nindependent set problem has a PTAS but does not admit an efficient\npolynomial-time approximation scheme (EPTAS). This implies a PTAS for our\nproblem, which is the best known result prior to this work. Our main\ncontribution is an EPTAS for the budgeted matroid independent set problem. A\nkey idea of the scheme is to find a representative set for the instance, whose\ncardinality depends solely on $1/\\varepsilon$, where $\\varepsilon > 0$ is the\naccuracy parameter of the scheme. The representative set is identified via\nmatroid basis minimization, which can be solved by a simple greedy algorithm.\nOur scheme enumerates over subsets of the representative set and extends each\nsubset using a linear program. The notion of representative sets may be useful\nin solving other variants of the budgeted matroid independent set problem.",

For T5, we show that learning hyper-parameters\nduring pretraining can improve performance across downstream NLU tasks.

Hence, the proposed scheme eliminates the\nneed for channel state information (CSI) at the EDs and ES. In this study, we\nanalyze various gradient-encoding strategies through the weight functions and\nwaveform configurations over orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM).\nWe show that specific weight functions that enable absentee EDs (i.e.,\nhard-coded participation with absentees (HPA)) or weighted votes (i.e.,\nsoft-coded participation (SP)) can substantially reduce the probability of\ndetecting the incorrect MV. By taking path loss, power control, cell size, and\nfading channel into account, we prove the convergence of the distributed\nlearning for a non-convex function for HPA.

However, up to 50% of images sent by patients have quality\nissues, thus increasing the time to diagnosis and treatment. An automated,\neasily deployable, explainable method for assessing image quality is necessary\nto improve the current teledermatological consultation flow. We introduce\nImageQX, a convolutional neural network trained for image quality assessment\nwith a learning mechanism for identifying the most common poor image quality\nexplanations: bad framing, bad lighting, blur, low resolution, and distance\nissues. ImageQX was trained on 26635 photographs and validated on 9874\nphotographs, each annotated with image quality labels and poor image quality\nexplanations by up to 12 board-certified dermatologists. The photographic\nimages were taken between 2017-2019 using a mobile skin disease tracking\napplication accessible worldwide. Our method achieves expert-level performance\nfor both image quality assessment and poor image quality explanation. For image\nquality assessment, ImageQX obtains a macro F1-score of 0.73 which places it\nwithin standard deviation of the pairwise inter-rater F1-score of 0.77. For\npoor image quality explanations, our method obtains F1-scores of between 0.37\nand 0.70, similar to the inter-rater pairwise F1-score of between 0.24 and\n0.83.

    "abstract": "Neuromuscular disorders, such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) and Duchenne\nMuscular Dystrophy (DMD), cause progressive muscular degeneration and loss of\nmotor function for 1 in 6,000 children. Traditional upper limb motor function\nassessments do not quantitatively measure patient-performed motions, which\nmakes it difficult to track progress for incremental changes. Assessing motor\nfunction in children with neuromuscular disorders is particularly challenging\nbecause they can be nervous or excited during experiments, or simply be too\nyoung to follow precise instructions. These challenges translate to confounding\nfactors such as performing different parts of the arm curl slower or faster\n(phase variability) which affects the assessed motion quality. This paper uses\ncurve registration and shape analysis to temporally align trajectories while\nsimultaneously extracting a mean reference shape. Distances from this mean\nshape are used to assess the quality of motion. The proposed metric is\ninvariant to confounding factors, such as phase variability, while suggesting\nseveral clinically relevant insights. First, there are statistically\nsignificant differences between functional scores for the control and patient\npopulations (p$=$0.0213$\\le$0.05). Next, several patients in the patient cohort\nare able to perform motion on par with the healthy cohort and vice versa. Our\nmetric, which is computed based on wearables, is related to the Brooke's score\n((p$=$0.00063$\\le$0.05)), as well as motor function assessments based on\ndynamometry ((p$=$0.0006$\\le$0.05)). These results show promise towards\nubiquitous motion quality assessment in daily life.",

    "abstract": "This work proposed kernel selection approaches for probabilistic classifiers\nbased on features produced by the convolutional encoder of a variational\nautoencoder. Particularly, the developed methodologies allow the selection of\nthe most relevant subset of latent variables. In the proposed implementation,\neach latent variable was sampled from the distribution associated with a single\nkernel of the last encoder's convolution layer, as an individual distribution\nwas created for each kernel. Therefore, choosing relevant features on the\nsampled latent variables makes it possible to perform kernel selection,\nfiltering the uninformative features and kernels. Such leads to a reduction in\nthe number of the model's parameters. Both wrapper and filter methods were\nevaluated for feature selection. The second was of particular relevance as it\nis based only on the distributions of the kernels. It was assessed by measuring\nthe Kullback-Leibler divergence between all distributions, hypothesizing that\nthe kernels whose distributions are more similar can be discarded. This\nhypothesis was confirmed since it was observed that the most similar kernels do\nnot convey relevant information and can be removed. As a result, the proposed\nmethodology is suitable for developing applications for resource-constrained\ndevices.",

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Navigation requires the agent to follow natural language\ninstructions to reach a specific target. The large discrepancy between seen and\nunseen environments makes it challenging for the agent to generalize well.\nPrevious studies propose data augmentation methods to mitigate the data bias\nexplicitly or implicitly and provide improvements in generalization. However,\nthey try to memorize augmented trajectories and ignore the distribution shifts\nunder unseen environments at test time. In this paper, we propose an Unseen\nDiscrepancy Anticipating Vision and Language Navigation (DAVIS) that learns to\ngeneralize to unseen environments via encouraging test-time visual consistency.\nSpecifically, we devise: 1) a semi-supervised framework DAVIS that leverages\nvisual consistency signals across similar semantic observations. 2) a two-stage\nlearning procedure that encourages adaptation to test-time distribution. The\nframework enhances the basic mixture of imitation and reinforcement learning\nwith Momentum Contrast to encourage stable decision-making on similar\nobservations under a joint training stage and a test-time adaptation stage.\nExtensive experiments show that DAVIS achieves model-agnostic improvement over\nprevious state-of-the-art VLN baselines on R2R and RxR benchmarks.

    "abstract": "To meet the timing requirements of interactive applications, the no-frills\ncongestion-agnostic transport protocols like UDP are increasingly deployed\nside-by-side in the same network with congestion-responsive TCP. In cloud\nplatforms, even though the computation and storage is totally virtualized, they\nlack a true virtualization mechanism for the network (i.e., the underlying data\ncenters networks). The impact of such lack of isolation services, may result\ninto frequent outages (for some applications) when such diverse traffics\ncontend for the small buffers in the commodity switches used in data centers.\nIn this paper, we explore the design space of a simple, practical and\ntransport-agnostic scheme to enable a scalable and flexible end-to-end\ncongestion control in data centers. Then, we present the the shortcomings of\ncoupling the monitoring and control of congestion in the conventional system\nand discuss how a Software-Defined Network (SDN) would provide an appealing\nalternative to circumvent the problems of the conventional system. The two\nsystems implements a software-based congestion control mechanisms that perform\nmonitoring, control decisions and traffic control enforcement functions. Both\nsystems are designed with a major assumption that the applications (or\ntransport protocols) are non-cooperative with the system, ultimately making it\ndeployable in existing data centers without any service disruption or hardware\nupgrade.

    "abstract": "An important problem across disciplines is the discovery of interventions\nthat produce a desired outcome. When the space of possible interventions is\nlarge, making an exhaustive search infeasible, experimental design strategies\nare needed. In this context, encoding the causal relationships between the\nvariables, and thus the effect of interventions on the system, is critical in\norder to identify desirable interventions efficiently. We develop an iterative\ncausal method to identify optimal interventions, as measured by the discrepancy\nbetween the post-interventional mean of the distribution and a desired target\nmean. We formulate an active learning strategy that uses the samples obtained\nso far from different interventions to update the belief about the underlying\ncausal model, as well as to identify samples that are most informative about\noptimal interventions and thus should be acquired in the next batch. The\napproach employs a Bayesian update for the causal model and prioritizes\ninterventions using a carefully designed, causally informed acquisition\nfunction. This acquisition function is evaluated in closed form, allowing for\nefficient optimization. The resulting algorithms are theoretically grounded\nwith information-theoretic bounds and provable consistency results. We\nillustrate the method on both synthetic data and real-world biological data,\nnamely gene expression data from Perturb-CITE-seq experiments, to identify\noptimal perturbations that induce a specific cell state transition; the\nproposed causal approach is observed to achieve better sample efficiency\ncompared to several baselines. In both cases we observe that the causally\ninformed acquisition function notably outperforms existing criteria allowing\nfor optimal intervention design with significantly less experiments.",

    "abstract": "Denoising diffusion models represent a recent emerging topic in computer\nvision, demonstrating remarkable results in the area of generative modeling. A\ndiffusion model is a deep generative model that is based on two stages, a\nforward diffusion stage and a reverse diffusion stage. In the forward diffusion\nstage, the input data is gradually perturbed over several steps by adding\nGaussian noise. In the reverse stage, a model is tasked at recovering the\noriginal input data by learning to gradually reverse the diffusion process,\nstep by step. Diffusion models are widely appreciated for the quality and\ndiversity of the generated samples, despite their known computational burdens,\ni.e. low speeds due to the high number of steps involved during sampling. In\nthis survey, we provide a comprehensive review of articles on denoising\ndiffusion models applied in vision, comprising both theoretical and practical\ncontributions in the field. First, we identify and present three generic\ndiffusion modeling frameworks, which are based on denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic models, noise conditioned score networks, and stochastic\ndifferential equations. We further discuss the relations between diffusion\nmodels and other deep generative models, including variational auto-encoders,\ngenerative adversarial networks, energy-based models, autoregressive models and\nnormalizing flows. Then, we introduce a multi-perspective categorization of\ndiffusion models applied in computer vision.

    "abstract": "The increasing availability of real-time data has fueled the prevalence of\nalgorithmic bidding (or autobidding) in online advertising markets, and has\nenabled online ad platforms to produce signals through machine learning\ntechniques (i.e., ML advice) on advertisers' true perceived values for ad\nconversions. Previous works have studied the auction design problem while\nincorporating ML advice through various forms to improve total welfare of\nadvertisers. Yet, such improvements could come at the cost of individual\nbidders' welfare, consequently eroding fairness of the ad platform. Motivated\nby this, we study how ad platforms can utilize ML advice to improve welfare\nguarantees and fairness on the individual bidder level in the autobidding\nworld. We focus on a practical setting where ML advice takes the form of lower\nconfidence bounds (or confidence intervals). We motivate a simple approach that\ndirectly sets such advice as personalized reserve prices when the platform\nconsists of value-maximizing autobidders who are subject to return-on-ad spent\n(ROAS) constraints competing in multiple parallel auctions. Under parallel VCG\nauctions with ML advice-based reserves, we present a worst-case welfare\nlower-bound guarantee for individual agents, and show that platform fairness is\npositively correlated with ML advice quality. We also present an instance that\ndemonstrates our welfare guarantee is tight. Further, we prove an impossibility\nresult showing that no truthful, possibly randomized mechanism with anonymous\nallocations and ML advice as personalized reserves can achieve universally\nbetter fairness guarantees than VCG when coupled with ML advice of the same\nquality. Finally, we extend our fairness guarantees with ML advice to\ngeneralized first price (GFP) and generalized second price (GSP) auctions.",

    "abstract": "Unlocking the full potential of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to enable or enhance\nvarious semantic and other applications requires Data Management Systems (DMSs)\nto efficiently store and process the content of KGs. However, the increases in\nthe size and variety of KG datasets as well as the growing diversity of KG\nqueries pose efficiency challenges for the current generation of DMSs to the\nextent that the performance of representative DMSs tends to vary significantly\nacross diverse query types and no single platform dominates performance. We\npresent our extensible prototype, SymphonyDB, as an approach to addressing this\nproblem based on a polyglot model of query processing as part of a\nmulti-database system supported by a unified access layer that can\nanalyze/translate individual queries just-in-time and match each to the likely\nbest-performing DMS among Virtuoso, Blazegraph, RDF-3X, and MongoDB as\nrepresentative DMSs that are included in our prototype at this time. The\nresults of our experiments with the prototype over well-known KG benchmark\ndatasets and queries point to the efficiency and consistency of its performance\nacross different query types and datasets.",

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) based Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Automatic\nTarget Recognition (ATR) systems have shown to be highly vulnerable to\nadversarial perturbations that are deliberately designed yet almost\nimperceptible but can bias DNN inference when added to targeted objects. This\nleads to serious safety concerns when applying DNNs to high-stake SAR ATR\napplications. Therefore, enhancing the adversarial robustness of DNNs is\nessential for implementing DNNs to modern real-world SAR ATR systems. Toward\nbuilding more robust DNN-based SAR ATR models, this article explores the domain\nknowledge of SAR imaging process and proposes a novel Scattering Model Guided\nAdversarial Attack (SMGAA) algorithm which can generate adversarial\nperturbations in the form of electromagnetic scattering response (called\nadversarial scatterers). The proposed SMGAA consists of two parts: 1) a\nparametric scattering model and corresponding imaging method and 2) a\ncustomized gradient-based optimization algorithm. First, we introduce the\neffective Attributed Scattering Center Model (ASCM) and a general imaging\nmethod to describe the scattering behavior of typical geometric structures in\nthe SAR imaging process. By further devising several strategies to take the\ndomain knowledge of SAR target images into account and relax the greedy search\nprocedure, the proposed method does not need to be prudentially finetuned, but\ncan efficiently to find the effective ASCM parameters to fool the SAR\nclassifiers and facilitate the robust model training. Comprehensive evaluations\non the MSTAR dataset show that the adversarial scatterers generated by SMGAA\nare more robust to perturbations and transformations in the SAR processing\nchain than the currently studied attacks, and are effective to construct a\ndefensive model against the malicious scatterers.",

This rank computation problem\nhas deterministic polynomial-time white-box algorithms \\cite{GGOW16, IQS18} and\na randomized polynomial-time algorithm in the black-box setting \\cite{DM17}. In\nthis paper, we propose a new approach for efficient derandomization of\n\\emph{black-box} RIT. Additionally, we obtain results for matrix rank\ncomputation over the free skew field, and construct efficient linear pencil\nrepresentations for a new class of rational expressions. More precisely, we\nshow the following results:\n1. Under the hardness assumption that the ABP (algebraic branching program)\ncomplexity of every polynomial identity for the $k\\times k$ matrix algebra is\n$2^{\\Omega(k)}$ \\cite{BW05}, we obtain a subexponential-time black-box\nalgorithm for RIT in almost general setting.

We show that the noncommutative rank of any matrix over the free skew\nfield whose entries have small linear pencil representations can be computed in\ndeterministic polynomial time.

Existing general purpose planning methods\noften produce poor quality solutions when available computation time is\nrestricted, or fail to produce a solution entirely. We propose a new motion\nplanning framework designed to operate in a user-defined task space, as opposed\nto the robot's workspace, that intentionally trades off workspace generality\nfor planning and execution time efficiency. Our framework automatically\nconstructs trajectory libraries that are queried online, similar to previous\nmethods that exploit offline computation.

The key idea is to\nestablish approximate isometries known as $\\epsilon$-Gromov-Hausdorff\napproximations such that points that are close by in task space are also close\nin configuration space. These bounding relations further imply that\ntrajectories can be smoothly concatenated, which enables our framework to\naddress batch-query scenarios where the objective is to find a minimum length\nsequence of trajectories that visit an unordered set of goals.

However, previous image\nretargeting methods create outputs that suffer from artifacts and distortions.\nBesides, most previous works attempt to retarget the background and foreground\nof the input image simultaneously. Simultaneous resizing of the foreground and\nbackground causes changes in the aspect ratios of the objects. The change in\nthe aspect ratio is specifically not desirable for human objects.

Therefore, depending\non the scenario, this could affect the operations and result in the safe\nlanding of UAVs. Hence, this paper presents a heuristic approach towards safe\nlanding of multi-rotor UAVs in the dynamic environments. The aim of this\napproach is to detect safe potential landing zones - PLZ, and find out the best\none to land in. The PLZ is initially, detected by processing an image through\nthe canny edge algorithm, and then the diameter-area estimation is applied for\neach region with minimal edges. The spots that have a higher area than the\nvehicle's clearance are labeled as safe PLZ. Onto the second phase of this\napproach, the velocities of dynamic obstacles that are moving towards the PLZs\nare calculated and their time to reach the zones are taken into consideration.\nThe ETA of the UAV is calculated and during the descending of UAV, the dynamic\nobstacle avoidance is executed.

In this paper, we\npropose a compound approach for end-to-end discriminative deep feature learning\nfor person Re-Id based on both body and hand images. We carefully design the\nLocal-Aware Global Attention Network (LAGA-Net), a multi-branch deep network\narchitecture consisting of one branch for spatial attention, one branch for\nchannel attention, one branch for global feature representations and another\nbranch for local feature representations. The attention branches focus on the\nrelevant features of the image while suppressing the irrelevant backgrounds. In\norder to overcome the weakness of the attention mechanisms, equivariant to\npixel shuffling, we integrate relative positional encodings into the spatial\nattention module to capture the spatial positions of pixels. The global branch\nintends to preserve the global context or structural information. For the the\nlocal branch, which intends to capture the fine-grained information, we perform\nuniform partitioning to generate stripes on the conv-layer horizontally. We\nretrieve the parts by conducting a soft partition without explicitly\npartitioning the images or requiring external cues such as pose estimation. A\nset of ablation study shows that each component contributes to the increased\nperformance of the LAGA-Net.

Specifically, the\nenergy-efficiency maximization is achieved for the considered AmBSC-enabled\nmulti-cluster cooperative IoT NOMA system by optimizing the active-beamforming\nvector and power-allocation coefficients (PAC) of IoT NOMA users at the\ntransmitter, as well as passive-beamforming vector at the multi-antenna\nassisted backscatter node. Usually, increasing the number of IoT NOMA users in\neach cluster results in inter-cluster interference (ICI) (among different\nclusters) and intra-cluster interference (among IoT NOMA users). To combat the\nimpact of ICI, we exploit a zero-forcing (ZF) based active-beamforming, as well\nas an efficient clustering technique at the source node. Further, the effect of\nintra-cluster interference is mitigated by exploiting an efficient\npower-allocation policy that determines the PAC of IoT NOMA users under the\nquality-of-service (QoS), cooperation, SIC decoding, and power-budget\nconstraints. Moreover, the considered non-convex passive-beamforming problem is\ntransformed into a standard semi-definite programming (SDP) problem by\nexploiting the successive-convex approximation (SCA) approximation, as well as\nthe difference of convex (DC) programming, where Rank-1 solution of\npassive-beamforming is obtained based on the penalty-based method.

We study the following problem: Give a polygon $W$,\npossibly with holes, with $n$ vertices, preprocess it such that given a query\nreal value $d\\geq 0$, one can efficiently compute the preimage $h^{-1}(d)$,\nnamely determine all the possible poses (positions and orientations) of a depth\nsensor placed in $W$ that would yield the reading $d$. We employ a\ndecomposition of $W\\times S^1$, which is an extension of the celebrated\ntrapezoidal decomposition, and which we call rotational trapezoidal\ndecomposition and present an efficient data structure, which computes the\npreimage in an output-sensitive fashion relative to this decomposition: if $k$\ncells of the decomposition contribute to the final result, we will report them\nin $O(k+1)$ time, after $O(n^2\\log n)$ preprocessing time and using $O(n^2)$\nstorage space. We also analyze the shape of the projection of the preimage onto\nthe polygon $W$; this projection describes the portion of $W$ where the sensor\ncould have been placed. Furthermore, we obtain analogous results for the more\nuseful case (narrowing down the set of possible poses), where the sensor\nperforms two depth measurement from the same point $p$, one in direction\n$\\theta$ and the other in direction $\\theta+\\pi$. While localizations problems\nin robotics are often carried out by exploring the full visibility polygon of a\nsensor placed at a fixed point of the environment, the approach that we propose\nhere opens the door to sufficing with only few depth measurements, which is\nadvantageous as it allows for usage of inexpensive sensors and could also lead\nto savings in storage and communication costs.",

However, existing SV calculation methods\nfor FL assume that the server can access the raw FL models and public test\ndata, which might not be a valid assumption in practice given the emerging\nprivacy attacks on FL models and that test data might be clients' private\nassets. Hence, in this paper, we investigate the problem of secure SV\ncalculation for cross-silo FL. We first propose a one-server solution, HESV,\nwhich is based solely on homomorphic encryption (HE) for privacy protection and\nhas some considerable limitations in efficiency. To overcome these limitations,\nwe further propose an efficient two-server protocol, SecSV, which has the\nfollowing novel features. First, SecSV utilizes a hybrid privacy protection\nscheme to avoid ciphertext-ciphertext multiplications between test data and\nmodels, which are extremely expensive under HE. Second, a more efficient secure\nmatrix multiplication method is proposed for SecSV. Third, SecSV strategically\nidentifies and skips some test samples without significantly affecting the\nevaluation accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that SecSV is 5.9-18.0 times\nas fast as HESV while sacrificing a limited loss in the accuracy of calculated\nSVs.",

    "title": "Using Quantum Computers to Speed Up Dynamic Testing of Software",
    "abstract": "Software under test can be analyzed dynamically, while it is being executed,\nto find defects. However, as the number and possible values of input parameters\nincrease, the cost of dynamic testing rises.\nThis paper examines whether quantum computers (QCs) can help speed up the\ndynamic testing of programs written for classical computers (CCs). To\naccomplish this, an approach is devised involving the following three steps:\n(1) converting a classical program to a quantum program; (2) computing the\nnumber of inputs causing errors, denoted by $K$, using a quantum counting\nalgorithm; and (3) obtaining the actual values of these inputs using Grover's\nsearch algorithm.\nThis approach can accelerate exhaustive and non-exhaustive dynamic testing\ntechniques. On the CC, the computational complexity of these techniques is\n$O(N)$, where $N$ represents the count of combinations of input parameter\nvalues passed to the software under test. In contrast, on the QC, the\ncomplexity is $O(\\varepsilon^{-1} \\sqrt{N/K})$, where $\\varepsilon$ is a\nrelative error of measuring $K$.\nThe paper illustrates how the approach can be applied and discusses its\nlimitations. Moreover, it provides a toy example executed on a simulator and an\nactual QC. This paper may be of interest to academics and practitioners as the\napproach presented in the paper may serve as a starting point for exploring the\nuse of QC for dynamic testing of CC code.",

To\naddress this challenge, we propose a novel de-biasing method named Inverse\nImage Frequency (IIF). IIF is a multiplicative margin adjustment transformation\nof the logits in the classification layer of a convolutional neural network.\nOur method achieves stronger performance than similar works and it is\nespecially useful for downstream tasks such as long-tailed instance\nsegmentation as it produces fewer false positive detections. Our extensive\nexperiments show that IIF surpasses the state of the art on many long-tailed\nbenchmarks such as ImageNet-LT, CIFAR-LT, Places-LT and LVIS, reaching 55.8%\ntop-1 accuracy with ResNet50 on ImageNet-LT and 26.2% segmentation AP with\nMaskRCNN on LVIS.

Recently, Implicit Maximum Likelihood\nEstimation (IMLE, Niepert, Minervini, and Franceschi 2021), a class of gradient\nestimators for discrete exponential family distributions, was proposed by\ncombining implicit differentiation through perturbation with the path-wise\ngradient estimator.

In this work, we present\nAdaptive IMLE (AIMLE) the first adaptive gradient estimator for complex\ndiscrete distributions: it adaptively identifies the target distribution for\nIMLE by trading off the density of gradient information with the degree of bias\nin the gradient estimates. We empirically evaluate our estimator on synthetic\nexamples, as well as on Learning to Explain, Discrete Variational\nAuto-Encoders, and Neural Relational Inference tasks.

    "abstract": "Quantum random number generators are a burgeoning technology used for a\nvariety of applications, including modern security and encryption systems.\nTypical methods exploit an entropy source combined with an extraction or bit\ngeneration circuit in order to produce a random string. In integrated designs\nthere is often little modelling or analytical description of the entropy\nsource, circuit extraction and post-processing provided. In this work, we first\ndiscuss theory on the quantum random flip-flop (QRFF), which elucidates the\nrole of circuit imperfections that manifest themselves in bias and correlation.\nThen, a Verilog-AMS model is developed in order to validate the analytical\nmodel in simulation. A novel transistor implementation of the QRFF circuit is\npresented, which enables compensation of the degradation in entropy inherent to\nthe finite non-symmetric transitions of the random flip-flop. Finally, a full\nsystem containing two independent arrays of the QRFF circuit is manufactured\nand tested in a 55 nm Bipolar-CMOS-DMOS (BCD) technology node, demonstrating\nbit generation statistics that are commensurate to the developed model. The\nfull chip is able to generate 3.3 Gbps of data when operated with an external\nLED, whereas an individual QRFF can generate 25 Mbps each of random data while\nmaintaining a Shannon entropy bound > 0.997, which is one of the highest per\npixel bit generation rates to date. NIST STS is used to benchmark the generated\nbit strings, thereby validating the QRFF circuit as an excellent candidate for\nfully-integrated QRNGs.",

    "abstract": "We study a fundamental model of online preference aggregation, where an\nalgorithm maintains an ordered list of $n$ elements. An input is a stream of\npreferred sets $R_1, R_2, \\dots, R_t, \\dots$. Upon seeing $R_t$ and without\nknowledge of any future sets, an algorithm has to rerank elements (change the\nlist ordering), so that at least one element of $R_t$ is found near the list\nfront. The incurred cost is a sum of the list update costs (the number of swaps\nof neighboring list elements) and access costs (position of the first element\nof $R_t$ on the list). This scenario occurs naturally in applications such as\nordering items in an online shop using aggregated preferences of shop\ncustomers. The theoretical underpinning of this problem is known as Min-Sum Set\nCover.\nUnlike previous work (Fotakis et al., ICALP 2020, NIPS 2020) that mostly\nstudied the performance of an online algorithm ALG against the static optimal\nsolution (a single optimal list ordering), in this paper, we study an arguably\nharder variant where the benchmark is the provably stronger optimal dynamic\nsolution OPT (that may also modify the list ordering). In terms of an online\nshop, this means that the aggregated preferences of its user base evolve with\ntime. We construct a computationally efficient randomized algorithm whose\ncompetitive ratio (ALG-to-OPT cost ratio) is $O(r^2)$ and prove the existence\nof a deterministic $O(r^4)$-competitive algorithm. Here, $r$ is the maximum\ncardinality of sets $R_t$. This is the first algorithm whose ratio does not\ndepend on $n$: the previously best algorithm for this problem was $O(r^{3/2}\n\\cdot \\sqrt{n})$-competitive and $\\Omega(r)$ is a lower bound on the\nperformance of any deterministic online algorithm.",

Their opinions toward\nthe COVID-19 vaccines may influence the vaccination uptake among the general\npopulation. However, vaccine hesitancy is still an important issue even among\nthe healthcare workers. Therefore, it is critical to understand their opinions\nto help reduce the level of vaccine hesitancy. There have been studies\nexamining healthcare workers' viewpoints on COVID-19 vaccines using\nquestionnaires. Reportedly, a considerably higher proportion of vaccine\nhesitancy is observed among nurses, compared to doctors. We intend to verify\nand study this phenomenon at a much larger scale and in fine grain using social\nmedia data, which has been effectively and efficiently leveraged by researchers\nto address real-world issues during the COVID-19 pandemic. More specifically,\nwe use a keyword search to identify healthcare workers and further classify\nthem into doctors and nurses from the profile descriptions of the corresponding\nTwitter users. Moreover, we apply a transformer-based language model to remove\nirrelevant tweets. Sentiment analysis and topic modeling are employed to\nanalyze and compare the sentiment and thematic differences in the tweets posted\nby doctors and nurses. We find that doctors are overall more positive toward\nthe COVID-19 vaccines. The focuses of doctors and nurses when they discuss\nvaccines in a negative way are in general different.

    "title": "Automatic Detection of Sentimentality from Facial Expressions",
    "abstract": "Emotion recognition has received considerable attention from the Computer\nVision community in the last 20 years. However, most of the research focused on\nanalyzing the six basic emotions (e.g. joy, anger, surprise), with a limited\nwork directed to other affective states. In this paper, we tackle\nsentimentality (strong feeling of heartwarming or nostalgia), a new emotional\nstate that has few works in the literature, and no guideline defining its\nfacial markers. To this end, we first collect a dataset of 4.9K videos of\nparticipants watching some sentimental and non-sentimental ads, and then we\nlabel the moments evoking sentimentality in the ads. Second, we use the\nad-level labels and the facial Action Units (AUs) activation across different\nframes for defining some weak frame-level sentimentality labels. Third, we\ntrain a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) using the AUs activation for sentimentality\ndetection. Finally, we define two new ad-level metrics for evaluating our model\nperformance. Quantitative and qualitative results show promising results for\nsentimentality detection. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work\nto address the problem of sentimentality detection.",

Indeed, it is very challenging problem in practice due to the\nlimitations of abstracted information from the engine. We therefore introduce a\nnew method named Attention-based Bijective Generative Adversarial Networks in a\nDistillation framework (DAB-GAN) to synthesize faces of a subject given his/her\nextracted face recognition features. Given any unconstrained unseen facial\nfeatures of a subject, the DAB-GAN can reconstruct his/her faces in high\ndefinition. The DAB-GAN method includes a novel attention-based generative\nstructure with the new defined Bijective Metrics Learning approach. The\nframework starts by introducing a bijective metric so that the distance\nmeasurement and metric learning process can be directly adopted in image domain\nfor an image reconstruction task. The information from the blackbox face\nrecognition engine will be optimally exploited using the global distillation\nprocess. Then an attention-based generator is presented for a highly robust\ngenerator to synthesize realistic faces with ID preservation. We have evaluated\nour method on the challenging face recognition databases, i.e. CelebA, LFW,\nAgeDB, CFP-FP, and consistently achieved the state-of-the-art results.

One of the fundamental\nreasons causing this limitation lies in the nature of the trial-and-error\nlearning paradigm of reinforcement learning, where the agent communicates with\nthe task and progresses the learning only relying on the reward signal, which\nis implicit and insufficient to learn a task well. On the contrary, human\nbeings mainly learn new skills via semantic representations or natural language\ninstructions. However, utilizing language instructions towards robotic motion\ncontrol to improve the adaptability is a newly emerged topic and challenging as\nwell. In this paper, we present an meta-RL algorithm that addresses the\nchallenge of learning skills with language instructions in multiple\nmanipulation tasks. On the one hand, our algorithm utilizes the language\ninstructions to shape its interpretation of the task, on the other hand, it\nstill learns to solve task in a trial-and-error process. We evaluate our\nalgorithm on the robotic manipulation benchmark (Meta-World) and significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-arts method in terms of training and testing success\nrates.

In particular, we analyze the equilibrium convergence properties of\nthe well-known \"follow the regularized leader\" (FTRL) class of algorithms when\nplayers can only observe a quantized (and possibly noisy) version of their\npayoffs. In this information-constrained setting, we show that coarser\nquantization triggers a qualitative shift in the convergence behavior of FTRL\nschemes. Specifically, if the quantization error lies below a threshold value\n(which depends only on the underlying game and not on the level of uncertainty\nentering the process or the specific FTRL variant under study), then (i) FTRL\nis attracted to the game's strict Nash equilibria with arbitrarily high\nprobability; and (ii) the algorithm's asymptotic rate of convergence remains\nthe same as in the non-quantized case. Otherwise, for larger quantization\nlevels, these convergence properties are lost altogether: players may fail to\nlearn anything beyond their initial state, even with full information on their\npayoff vectors. This is in contrast to the impact of quantization in continuous\noptimization problems, where the quality of the obtained solution degrades\nsmoothly with the quantization level.",

In this paper, we initiate the study of\nCompound Cyber-Physical Threats and develop a two-stage framework for the\nanalysis of operational disruptions in electric power networks and economy-wide\nimpacts under three scenarios: a Heatwave, a Cyberattack, and a Compound\nscenario when the Cyberattack is timed with the Heatwave. In the first stage,\nwe use a bilevel optimization problem to represent the adversarial rationale of\na cyberattacker in the upper level. In the lower level, we model disruptions in\nthe electric power network using an optimal power flow model. In the second\nstage, we couple the disruption of electricity supply with a Computable General\nEquilibrium model to elucidate the impacts on all economic sectors. For the New\nYork Independent System Operator, we find that a 9% demand increase in a\nHeatwave may not lead to unserved load. The Cyberattack can lead to 4% of\nunserved electric load in Long Island, while the Compound scenario can increase\nunserved electric load in Long Island to 13% and affect almost 600,000\ncustomers. Our results show that the activity of state and local government\nenterprises can decrease by 30% in the Compound scenario.

However, these\napplications might not be reliable if not secured against adversarial attacks.\nIn addition, recent works demonstrated that some adversarial examples are\ntransferable across different models. Therefore, it is crucial to avoid such\ntransferability via robust models that resist adversarial manipulations. In\nthis paper, we propose a feature randomization-based approach that resists\neight adversarial attacks targeting deep learning models in the testing phase.\nOur novel approach consists of changing the training strategy in the target\nnetwork classifier and selecting random feature samples. We consider the\nattacker with a Limited-Knowledge and Semi-Knowledge conditions to undertake\nthe most prevalent types of adversarial attacks.

Due to the computationally\nexpensive nature of their standard solution methods, neural PDE surrogates have\nbecome an active research topic to accelerate these simulations. However,\ncurrent methods do not explicitly take into account the relationship between\ndifferent fields and their internal components, which are often correlated.\nViewing the time evolution of such correlated fields through the lens of\nmultivector fields allows us to overcome these limitations.

    "abstract": "Scene flow represents the 3D motion of each point in the scene, which\nexplicitly describes the distance and the direction of each point's movement.\nScene flow estimation is used in various applications such as autonomous\ndriving fields, activity recognition, and virtual reality fields. As it is\nchallenging to annotate scene flow with ground truth for real-world data, this\nleaves no real-world dataset available to provide a large amount of data with\nground truth for scene flow estimation. Therefore, many works use synthesized\ndata to pre-train their network and real-world LiDAR data to finetune. Unlike\nthe previous unsupervised learning of scene flow in point clouds, we propose to\nuse odometry information to assist the unsupervised learning of scene flow and\nuse real-world LiDAR data to train our network. Supervised odometry provides\nmore accurate shared cost volume for scene flow. In addition, the proposed\nnetwork has mask-weighted warp layers to get a more accurate predicted point\ncloud. The warp operation means applying an estimated pose transformation or\nscene flow to a source point cloud to obtain a predicted point cloud and is the\nkey to refining scene flow from coarse to fine. When performing warp\noperations, the points in different states use different weights for the pose\ntransformation and scene flow transformation. We classify the states of points\nas static, dynamic, and occluded, where the static masks are used to divide\nstatic and dynamic points, and the occlusion masks are used to divide occluded\npoints. The mask-weighted warp layer indicates that static masks and occlusion\nmasks are used as weights when performing warp operations. Our designs are\nproved to be effective in ablation experiments. The experiment results show the\npromising prospect of an odometry-assisted unsupervised learning method for 3D\nscene flow in real-world data.",

    "abstract": "The Upper Indus Basin, Himalayas provides water for 270 million people and\ncountless ecosystems. However, precipitation, a key component to hydrological\nmodelling, is poorly understood in this area. A key challenge surrounding this\nuncertainty comes from the complex spatial-temporal distribution of\nprecipitation across the basin. In this work we propose Gaussian processes with\nstructured non-stationary kernels to model precipitation patterns in the UIB.\nPrevious attempts to quantify or model precipitation in the Hindu Kush\nKarakoram Himalayan region have often been qualitative or include crude\nassumptions and simplifications which cannot be resolved at lower resolutions.\nThis body of research also provides little to no error propagation. We account\nfor the spatial variation in precipitation with a non-stationary Gibbs kernel\nparameterised with an input dependent lengthscale. This allows the posterior\nfunction samples to adapt to the varying precipitation patterns inherent in the\ndistinct underlying topography of the Indus region. The input dependent\nlengthscale is governed by a latent Gaussian process with a stationary\nsquared-exponential kernel to allow the function level hyperparameters to vary\nsmoothly. In ablation experiments we motivate each component of the proposed\nkernel by demonstrating its ability to model the spatial covariance, temporal\nstructure and joint spatio-temporal reconstruction.

Several methods have been proposed to compute the\nsimilarity between sequences, such as the exact approach that counts the number\nof matches between $k$-mers (sub-sequences of length $k$) and an approximate\napproach that estimates pairwise similarity scores. Although exact methods\nyield better classification performance, they pose high computational costs,\nlimiting their applicability to a small number of sequences.

To overcome the shortcomings of the\nconventional methods with matched preconditions, the fuzzy $H_{\\infty}$ filter\nto be designed and the T-S fuzzy model are assumed to have different premise\nmembership functions and number of rules, thus, greater design flexibility and\nrobustness to uncertainty can be achieved.

However, despite the close connection shared with these tasks, research\non question answering over knowledge bases (KBQA) has comparatively been\nprogressing slowly. We identify and attribute this to two unique challenges of\nKBQA, schema-level complexity and fact-level complexity. In this survey, we\nsituate KBQA in the broader literature of semantic parsing and give a\ncomprehensive account of how existing KBQA approaches attempt to address the\nunique challenges. Regardless of the unique challenges, we argue that we can\nstill take much inspiration from the literature of semantic parsing, which has\nbeen overlooked by existing research on KBQA. Based on our discussion, we can\nbetter understand the bottleneck of current KBQA research and shed light on\npromising directions for KBQA to keep up with the literature of semantic\nparsing, particularly in the era of pre-trained language models.",

    "abstract": "Online Knowledge Distillation (OKD) improves the involved models by\nreciprocally exploiting the difference between teacher and student. Several\ncrucial bottlenecks over the gap between them -- e.g., Why and when does a\nlarge gap harm the performance, especially for student? How to quantify the gap\nbetween teacher and student? -- have received limited formal study. In this\npaper, we propose Switchable Online Knowledge Distillation (SwitOKD), to answer\nthese questions. Instead of focusing on the accuracy gap at test phase by the\nexisting arts, the core idea of SwitOKD is to adaptively calibrate the gap at\ntraining phase, namely distillation gap, via a switching strategy between two\nmodes -- expert mode (pause the teacher while keep the student learning) and\nlearning mode (restart the teacher). To possess an appropriate distillation\ngap, we further devise an adaptive switching threshold, which provides a formal\ncriterion as to when to switch to learning mode or expert mode, and thus\nimproves the student's performance. Meanwhile, the teacher benefits from our\nadaptive switching threshold and keeps basically on a par with other online\narts. We further extend SwitOKD to multiple networks with two basis topologies.\nFinally, extensive experiments and analysis validate the merits of SwitOKD for\nclassification over the state-of-the-arts.

In recent years,\nmethods relying on stochastic ordering have been developed to create \"fairer\"\nrankings that reduce inequality in who or what is shown to users. Complete\nrandomization -- ordering candidate items randomly, independent of estimated\nrelevance -- is largely considered a baseline procedure that results in the\nmost equal distribution of exposure. In industry settings, recommender systems\noften operate via a two-step process in which candidate items are first\nproduced using computationally inexpensive methods and then a full ranking\nmodel is applied only to those candidates.\nIn this paper, we consider the effects of inequality at the first step and\nshow that, paradoxically, complete randomization at the second step can result\nin a higher degree of inequality relative to deterministic ordering of items by\nestimated relevance scores. In light of this observation, we then propose a\nsimple post-processing algorithm in pursuit of reducing exposure inequality\nthat works both when candidate sets have a high level of imbalance and when\nthey do not. The efficacy of our method is illustrated on both simulated data\nand a common benchmark data set used in studying fairness in recommender\nsystems.",

While original nDCG, MAP etc. metrics are normalized\nin terms of their upper bounds based on an ideal ranked list, a corresponding\nLB normalization for them has not yet been studied. Specifically, we introduce\ntwo different variants of the proposed LB normalization, where the lower bound\nis estimated from a randomized ranking of the corresponding documents present\nin the evaluation set. We next conducted two case-studies by instantiating the\nnew framework for two popular IR evaluation metric (with two variants, e.g.,\nDCG_UL_V1,2 and MSP_UL_V1,2 ) and then comparing against the traditional metric\nwithout the proposed LB normalization. Experiments on two different data-sets\nwith eight Learning-to-Rank (LETOR) methods demonstrate the following\nproperties of the new LB normalized metric: 1) Statistically significant\ndifferences (between two methods) in terms of original metric no longer remain\nstatistically significant in terms of Upper Lower (UL) Bound normalized version\nand vice-versa, especially for uninformative query-sets. 2) When compared\nagainst the original metric, our proposed UL normalized metrics demonstrate\nhigher Discriminatory Power and better Consistency across different data-sets.\nThese findings suggest that the IR community should consider UL normalization\nseriously when computing nDCG and MAP and more in-depth study of UL\nnormalization for general IR evaluation is warranted.",

As the training of ML models\nrequires a massive amount of good quality data, it is necessary to eliminate\nconcerns about data privacy and ensure high-quality data. To solve this\nproblem, we cast our eyes on the integration of CML and smart contracts. Based\non blockchain, smart contracts enable automatic execution of data preserving\nand validation, as well as the continuity of CML model training. In our\nsimulation experiments, we define incentive mechanisms on the smart contract,\ninvestigate the important factors such as the number of features in the dataset\n(num_words), the size of the training data, the cost for the data holders to\nsubmit data, etc., and conclude how these factors impact the performance\nmetrics of the model: the accuracy of the trained model, the gap between the\naccuracies of the model before and after simulation, and the time to use up the\nbalance of bad agent.

Using data from PoseIt, we can formulate and\ntackle the task of predicting whether a grasped object is stable in a\nparticular held pose. We train an LSTM classifier that achieves 85% accuracy on\nthe proposed task. Our experimental results show that multi-modal models\ntrained on PoseIt achieve higher accuracy than using solely vision or tactile\ndata and that our classifiers can also generalize to unseen objects and poses.",

In this\npaper, we propose a new integrated air-ground networking paradigm that uses\ndual-functional UAVs to assist the ground networks for improving both\ncommunication and localization performance. We investigate the optimization\nproblem of deploying the minimal number of UAVs to satisfy the communication\nand localization requirements of ground users. The problem has several\ntechnical difficulties including the cardinality minimization, the\nnon-convexity of localization performance metric regarding UAV location, and\nthe association between user and communication terminal. To tackle the\ndifficulties, we adopt D-optimality as the localization performance metric, and\nderive the geometric characteristics of the feasible UAV hovering regions in 2D\nand 3D based on accurate approximation values. We solve the simplified 2D\nprojection deployment problem by transforming the problem into a minimum\nhitting set problem, and propose a low-complexity algorithm to solve it.\nThrough numerical simulations, we compare our proposed algorithm with benchmark\nmethods. The number of UAVs required by the proposed algorithm is close to the\noptimal solution, while other benchmark methods require much more UAVs to\naccomplish the same task.",

Here, we present an action anticipation model that\nleverages goal information for the purpose of reducing the uncertainty in\nfuture predictions. Since we do not possess goal information or the observed\nactions during inference, we resort to visual representation to encapsulate\ninformation about both actions and goals. Through this, we derive a novel\nconcept called abstract goal which is conditioned on observed sequences of\nvisual features for action anticipation.

    "abstract": "Recent studies show that models trained on synthetic datasets are able to\nachieve better generalizable person re-identification (GPReID) performance than\nthat trained on public real-world datasets. On the other hand, due to the\nlimitations of real-world person ReID datasets, it would also be important and\ninteresting to use large-scale synthetic datasets as test sets to benchmark\nperson ReID algorithms. Yet this raises a critical question: is synthetic\ndataset reliable for benchmarking generalizable person re-identification? In\nthe literature there is no evidence showing this. To address this, we design a\nmethod called Pairwise Ranking Analysis (PRA) to quantitatively measure the\nranking similarity and perform the statistical test of identical distributions.\nSpecifically, we employ Kendall rank correlation coefficients to evaluate\npairwise similarity values between algorithm rankings on different datasets.\nThen, a non-parametric two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test is performed for\nthe judgement of whether algorithm ranking correlations between synthetic and\nreal-world datasets and those only between real-world datasets lie in identical\ndistributions. We conduct comprehensive experiments, with ten representative\nalgorithms, three popular real-world person ReID datasets, and three recently\nreleased large-scale synthetic datasets. Through the designed pairwise ranking\nanalysis and comprehensive evaluations, we conclude that a recent large-scale\nsynthetic dataset ClonedPerson can be reliably used to benchmark GPReID,\nstatistically the same as real-world datasets. Therefore, this study guarantees\nthe usage of synthetic datasets for both source training set and target testing\nset, with completely no privacy concerns from real-world surveillance data.\nBesides, the study in this paper might also inspire future designs of synthetic\ndatasets.",

    "abstract": "Reading computer program code and documentation written by others is, we are\ntold, one of the best ways to learn the art of writing intelligible and\nmaintainable code and documentation. The software resurrection exercise,\nintroduced in this paper, requires a motivated learner to compile and test a\nhistorical release (e.g. 20 years old) version of a well maintained and widely\nadopted open source software on a modern hardware and software platform. This\nexercise concludes by writing a critique based on issues encountered while\ncompiling and testing a historical software release on a hardware and software\nplatform that could not have been foreseen at the time of release. The learner\nis also required to fix the issues as a part of the software resurrection\nexercise. The seemingly pointless exercise of resurrecting a historical\nsoftware allows motivated learners to experience the pain and joy of software\nmaintenance which is essential for understanding the factors that contribute to\nintelligibility and maintainability of program code and documentation. The\nconcept of software resurrection exercise is illustrated using a version of the\nSQLite database engine that was released 20 years ago. This illustration shows\nthat software engineering principles (or programming pearls) emerge when a\nhistorical software release is adapted to run successfully on a modern\nplatform.

    "abstract": "Despite great recent advances achieved by deep neural networks (DNNs), they\nare often vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Intensive research efforts have\nbeen made to improve the robustness of DNNs; however, most empirical defenses\ncan be adaptively attacked again, and the theoretically certified robustness is\nlimited, especially on large-scale datasets. One potential root cause of such\nvulnerabilities for DNNs is that although they have demonstrated powerful\nexpressiveness, they lack the reasoning ability to make robust and reliable\npredictions. In this paper, we aim to integrate domain knowledge to enable\nrobust learning with the reasoning paradigm. In particular, we propose a\ncertifiably robust learning with reasoning pipeline (CARE), which consists of a\nlearning component and a reasoning component. Concretely, we use a set of\nstandard DNNs to serve as the learning component to make semantic predictions,\nand we leverage the probabilistic graphical models, such as Markov logic\nnetworks (MLN), to serve as the reasoning component to enable knowledge/logic\nreasoning. However, it is known that the exact inference of MLN (reasoning) is\n#P-complete, which limits the scalability of the pipeline. To this end, we\npropose to approximate the MLN inference via variational inference based on an\nefficient expectation maximization algorithm. In particular, we leverage graph\nconvolutional networks (GCNs) to encode the posterior distribution during\nvariational inference and update the parameters of GCNs (E-step) and the\nweights of knowledge rules in MLN (M-step) iteratively. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on different datasets and show that CARE achieves significantly\nhigher certified robustness compared with the state-of-the-art baselines. We\nadditionally conducted different ablation studies to demonstrate the empirical\nrobustness of CARE and the effectiveness of different knowledge integration.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 has shown the importance of having a fast response against\npandemics. Finding a novel drug is a very long and complex procedure, and it is\npossible to accelerate the preliminary phases by using computer simulations. In\nparticular, virtual screening is an in-silico phase that is needed to filter a\nlarge set of possible drug candidates to a manageable number. This paper\npresents the implementations and a comparative analysis of two GPU-optimized\nimplementations of a virtual screening algorithm targeting novel GPU\narchitectures. The first adopts a traditional approach that spreads the\ncomputation required to evaluate a single molecule across the entire GPU. The\nsecond uses a batched approach that exploits the parallel architecture of the\nGPU to evaluate more molecules in parallel, without considering the latency to\nprocess a single molecule. The paper describes the advantages and disadvantages\nof the proposed solutions, highlighting implementation details that impact the\nperformance. Experimental results highlight the different performance of the\ntwo methods on several target molecule databases while running on NVIDIA A100\nGPUs. The two implementations have a strong dependency with respect to the data\nto be processed. For both cases, the performance is improving while reducing\nthe dimension of the target molecules (number of atoms and rotatable bonds).\nThe two methods demonstrated a different behavior with respect to the size of\nthe molecule database to be screened. While the latency one reaches sooner\n(with fewer molecules) the performance plateau in terms of throughput, the\nbatched one requires a larger set of molecules. However, the performances after\nthe initial transient period are much higher (up to 5x speed-up). Finally, to\ncheck the efficiency of both implementations we deeply analyzed their workload\ncharacteristics using the instruction roof-line methodology.",

    "title": "Hard Negatives or False Negatives: Correcting Pooling Bias in Training  Neural Ranking Models",
    "abstract": "Neural ranking models (NRMs) have become one of the most important techniques\nin information retrieval (IR). Due to the limitation of relevance labels, the\ntraining of NRMs heavily relies on negative sampling over unlabeled data. In\ngeneral machine learning scenarios, it has shown that training with hard\nnegatives (i.e., samples that are close to positives) could lead to better\nperformance. Surprisingly, we find opposite results from our empirical studies\nin IR. When sampling top-ranked results (excluding the labeled positives) as\nnegatives from a stronger retriever, the performance of the learned NRM becomes\neven worse. Based on our investigation, the superficial reason is that there\nare more false negatives (i.e., unlabeled positives) in the top-ranked results\nwith a stronger retriever, which may hurt the training process; The root is the\nexistence of pooling bias in the dataset constructing process, where annotators\nonly judge and label very few samples selected by some basic retrievers.\nTherefore, in principle, we can formulate the false negative issue in training\nNRMs as learning from labeled datasets with pooling bias. To solve this\nproblem, we propose a novel Coupled Estimation Technique (CET) that learns both\na relevance model and a selection model simultaneously to correct the pooling\nbias for training NRMs. Empirical results on three retrieval benchmarks show\nthat NRMs trained with our technique can achieve significant gains on ranking\neffectiveness against other baseline strategies.",

    "abstract": "A major focus of recent developments in stereo vision has been on how to\nobtain accurate dense disparity maps in passive stereo vision. Active vision\nsystems enable more accurate estimations of dense disparity compared to passive\nstereo. However, subpixel-accurate disparity estimation remains an open problem\nthat has received little attention. In this paper, we propose a new learning\nstrategy to train neural networks to estimate high-quality subpixel disparity\nmaps for semi-dense active stereo vision. The key insight is that neural\nnetworks can double their accuracy if they are able to jointly learn how to\nrefine the disparity map while invalidating the pixels where there is\ninsufficient information to correct the disparity estimate. Our approach is\nbased on Bayesian modeling where validated and invalidated pixels are defined\nby their stochastic properties, allowing the model to learn how to choose by\nitself which pixels are worth its attention. Using active stereo datasets such\nas Active-Passive SimStereo, we demonstrate that the proposed method\noutperforms the current state-of-the-art active stereo models. We also\ndemonstrate that the proposed approach compares favorably with state-of-the-art\npassive stereo models on the Middlebury dataset.",

In this setting, we investigate feature selection, aiming to derive\nsparse, explainable models with improved out-of-sample performance. Up to now,\nstate-of-the-art methods utilize regularization, which penalizes the number of\nselected features or the norm of the solution vector. As an alternative, we\nintroduce a novel bilevel programming formulation.

The lower-level\nproblem learns the optimal coefficients of the decision function on a training\nset, using only the features selected by the upper-level. We present a mixed\ninteger linear program reformulation for the bilevel program, which can be\nsolved to optimality with standard optimization solvers. Our computational\nexperiments show that the method accurately recovers ground-truth features\nalready for instances with a sample size of a few hundred observations.

    "abstract": "Real-time acquisition of accurate machine parameters is of significance to\nachieving high performance in electric drives, particularly targeted for\nmission-critical applications. Unlike the saturation effects, the temperature\nvariations are difficult to predict, thus it is essential to track\ntemperature-dependent parameters online. In this paper, a unified framework is\ndeveloped for online parameter identification of rotating electric machines,\npremised on the Recursive Prediction Error Method (RPEM). Secondly, the\nprediction gradient ($\\mathbf{\\Psi}^T$)-based RPEM is adopted for\nidentification of the temperature-sensitive parameters, i.e., the permanent\nmagnet flux linkage ($\\Psi_m$) and stator-winding resistance ($R_s$) of the\nInterior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (IPMSM). Three algorithms,\nnamely, Stochastic Gradient (SGA), Gauss-Newton (GNA), and physically\ninterpretative method (PhyInt) are investigated for the estimation gains\ncomputation. A speed-dependent gain-scheduling scheme is used to decouple the\ninter-dependency of $\\Psi_m$ and $R_s$. With the aid of offline simulation\nmethods, the main elements of RPEM such as $\\mathbf{\\Psi}^T$ are analyzed. The\nconcept validation and the choice of the optimal algorithm is made with the use\nof System-on-Chip (SoC) based Embedded Real-Time Simulator (ERTS).\nSubsequently, the selected algorithms are validated with the aid of a 3-kW,\nIPMSM drive where the control and estimation routines are implemented in the\nSoC-based industrial embedded control system.

    "abstract": "Twelve years ago, the European Union began with the gradual phase-out of\nenergy-inefficient incandescent light bulbs under the Ecodesign Directive. In\nthis work, we implement an agent-based simulation to model the consumer\nbehaviour in the EU lighting market with the goal to explain consumer behaviour\nand explore alternative policies. Agents are based on the Consumat II model,\nhave individual preferences based on empirical market research, gather\nexperience from past actions, and socially interact with each other in a\ndynamic environment. Our findings suggest that the adoption of energy-friendly\nlighting alternatives was hindered by a low level of consumer interest combined\nwith high-enough levels of satisfaction about incandescent bulbs and that\ninformation campaigns can partially address this. These findings offer insight\ninto both individual-level driving forces of behaviour and society-level\noutcomes in a niche market. With this, our work demonstrates the strengths of\nagent-based models for policy generation and evaluation.",

This survey, instead, takes a\ncomplementary, challenge-based approach, which we believe might be more\npractical to developers facing a concrete e-recruitment design task with a\nspecific set of challenges, as well as to researchers looking for impactful\nresearch projects in this domain.

    "abstract": "The impact of information and communication technologies (ICT) on global\nenergy consumption is increasing every year, and the consumption of equipment\nfor telecommunications accounts for a significant portion of it. Specifically,\nmore than 50\\% of the total energy consumption of ICT is issued from the radio\naccess networks (RANs), due mainly to the rapid penetration of data-intensive\napplications and the increasing heterogeneity, dynamicity, and unpredictability\nof traffic. To tackle these high-demanding problems, RAN densification through\nthe installation of additional base stations (BSs) in high demand areas is\nconventionally used. However, this leads to inefficient energy use and\nover-provisioning issues. To increase the energy efficiency and mitigate the\nenvironmental effects of the RANs, various techniques such as sleep scheduling\nand cell switch-off have been widely studied in the literature. However, their\npractical use remains questionable. In this context, high altitude platform\nstations (HAPS) emerged as a novel paradigm-shift recently. HAPS may be used to\ncomplement RANs and sustain their services in densely populated areas, where\ntraffic can peak unpredictably. Due to their wide coverage areas, substantial\ncommunication payloads, and green energy model, HAPS super macro base stations\n(SMBSs) are capable of handling the massive and dynamic mobile data traffic of\nground users. In this paper, we show how HAPS-SMBSs can complement RANs and\nserve the dynamic and unpredictable traffic demands of users in an energy\nefficient manner. Through the simulation of a case study, we demonstrate the\nsuperior performance of a HAPS-SMBS compared to the conventional RAN\ndensification method in addition to its advantages of being environmentally\nfriendly and socially acceptable.",

We consider two\nreconfiguration rules. Intuitively, we view each independent set as a\ncollection of tokens placed on the vertices of the graph. Then, the Token\nSliding Optimization (TSO) problem asks whether there exists a sequence of at\nmost $\\ell$ steps that transforms $S$ into $T$, where at each step we are\nallowed to slide one token from a vertex to an unoccupied neighboring vertex.\nIn the Token Jumping Optimization (TJO) problem, at each step, we are allowed\nto jump one token from a vertex to any other unoccupied vertex of the graph.\nBoth TSO and TJO are known to be fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized\nby $\\ell$ on nowhere dense classes of graphs.

Several research groups, such as\nCensored Planet, have deployed large scale Internet measurement platforms to\ncollect network reachability data. However, existing studies generally rely on\nmanually designed rules (i.e., using censorship fingerprints) to detect\nnetwork-based Internet censorship from the data. While this rule-based approach\nyields a high true positive detection rate, it suffers from several challenges:\nit requires human expertise, is laborious, and cannot detect any censorship not\ncaptured by the rules. Seeking to overcome these challenges, we design and\nevaluate a classification model based on latent feature representation learning\nand an image-based classification model to detect network-based Internet\ncensorship.\nTo infer latent feature representations from network reachability data, we\npropose a sequence-to-sequence autoencoder to capture the structure and the\norder of data elements in the data. To estimate the probability of censorship\nevents from the inferred latent features, we rely on a densely connected\nmulti-layer neural network model.\nOur image-based classification model encodes a network reachability data\nrecord as a gray-scale image and classifies the image as censored or not using\na dense convolutional neural network. We compare and evaluate both approaches\nusing data sets from Censored Planet via a hold-out evaluation. Both\nclassification models are capable of detecting network-based Internet\ncensorship as we were able to identify instances of censorship not detected by\nthe known fingerprints.

    "title": "Multiple Control Barrier Functions: An Application to Reactive Obstacle  Avoidance for a Multi-steering Tractor-trailer System",
    "abstract": "Control barrier functions (CBFs) recently introduced a systematic way to\nguarantee the system's safety through set invariance. Together with a nominal\ncontrol method, it establishes a safety-critical control mechanism. The\nresulting safety constraints can be enforced as hard constraints in quadratic\nprogramming (QP) optimization, which rectifies the nominal control law based on\nthe set of safe inputs. In this work, we introduce a multiple CBFs scheme which\nenforces several safety constraints with high relative degrees. This control\nstructure is essential in many challenging robotic applications that need to\nmeet several safety criteria simultaneously. In order to illustrate the\ncapabilities of the proposed method, we have addressed the problem of reactive\nobstacle avoidance for a class of tractor-trailer systems. Safety is one of the\nfundamental issues in autonomous tractor-trailer systems design. The lack of\nfast response due to poor maneuverability makes reactive obstacle avoidance\ndifficult for these systems. We develop a control structure based on a multiple\nCBFs scheme for a multi-steering tractor-trailer system to ensure a\ncollision-free maneuver for both the tractor and trailer in the presence of\nseveral obstacles. Model predictive control is selected as the nominal tracking\ncontroller, and the proposed control strategy is tested in several challenging\nscenarios.",

    "title": "Global Prototype Encoding for Incremental Video Highlights Detection",
    "abstract": "Video highlights detection has been long researched as a topic in computer\nvision tasks, digging the user-appealing clips out given unexposed raw video\ninputs. However, in most case, the mainstream methods in this line of research\nare built on the closed world assumption, where a fixed number of highlight\ncategories is defined properly in advance and need all training data to be\navailable at the same time, and as a result, leads to poor scalability with\nrespect to both the highlight categories and the size of the dataset. To tackle\nthe problem mentioned above, we propose a video highlights detector that is\nable to learn incrementally, namely \\textbf{G}lobal \\textbf{P}rototype\n\\textbf{E}ncoding (GPE), capturing newly defined video highlights in the\nextended dataset via their corresponding prototypes. Alongside, we present a\nwell annotated and costly dataset termed \\emph{ByteFood}, including more than\n5.1k gourmet videos belongs to four different domains which are \\emph{cooking},\n\\emph{eating}, \\emph{food material}, and \\emph{presentation} respectively. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first time the incremental learning\nsettings are introduced to video highlights detection, which in turn relieves\nthe burden of training video inputs and promotes the scalability of\nconventional neural networks in proportion to both the size of the dataset and\nthe quantity of domains. Moreover, the proposed GPE surpasses current\nincremental learning methods on \\emph{ByteFood}, reporting an improvement of\n1.57\\% mAP at least. The code and dataset will be made available sooner.",

    "title": "Attitude-Guided Loop Closure for Cameras with Negative Plane",
    "abstract": "Loop closure is an important component of Simultaneous Localization and\nMapping (SLAM) systems. Large Field-of-View (FoV) cameras have received\nextensive attention in the SLAM field as they can exploit more surrounding\nfeatures on the panoramic image. In large-FoV VIO, for incorporating the\ninformative cues located on the negative plane of the panoramic lens, image\nfeatures are represented by a three-dimensional vector with a unit length.\nWhile the panoramic FoV is seemingly advantageous for loop closure, the\nbenefits cannot easily be materialized under large-attitude-angle differences,\nwhere loop-closure frames can hardly be matched by existing methods. In this\nwork, to fully unleash the potential of ultra-wide FoV, we propose to leverage\nthe attitude information of a VIO system to guide the feature point detection\nof the loop closure. As loop closure on wide-FoV panoramic data further comes\nwith a large number of outliers, traditional outlier rejection methods are not\ndirectly applicable. To tackle this issue, we propose a loop closure framework\nwith a new outlier rejection method based on the unit length representation, to\nimprove the accuracy of LF-VIO. On the public PALVIO dataset, a comprehensive\nset of experiments is carried out and the proposed LF-VIO-Loop outperforms\nstate-of-the-art visual-inertial-odometry methods.

    "abstract": "Many scenarios where agents with restrictions compete for resources can be\ncast as maximum matching problems on bipartite graphs. Our focus is on resource\nallocation problems where agents may have restrictions that make them\nincompatible with some resources. We assume that a Principle chooses a maximum\nmatching randomly so that each agent is matched to a resource with some\nprobability. Agents would like to improve their chances of being matched by\nmodifying their restrictions within certain limits. The Principle's goal is to\nadvise an unsatisfied agent to relax its restrictions so that the total cost of\nrelaxation is within a budget (chosen by the agent) and the increase in the\nprobability of being assigned a resource is maximized. We establish hardness\nresults for some variants of this budget-constrained maximization problem and\npresent algorithmic results for other variants.

    "title": "Evolution of trust in a hierarchical population with punishing investors",
    "abstract": "Trust plays an essential role in the development of human society. According\nto the standard trust game, an investor decides whether to keep or transfer a\ncertain portion of initial stake to a trustee. In the latter case, the stake is\nenhanced to signal the value of trust. The trustee then chooses how much to\nreturn to the investor. We here distinguish two types of investors and two\ntypes of trustees who can learn from each other. While a trustee can be\ntrustworthy or untrustworthy, an investor could be normal or punishing one. The\nlatter strategy punishes both untrustworthy trustees and normal investors who\nare reluctant to control misbehaving trustees. Importantly, we assume a\nhierarchical population where the portion of investors and trustees is fixed.\nBy means of replicator equation approach, we study the $N$-player trust game\nand calculate the level of trust and trustworthiness. We find that the\nintroduction of punishment can induce a stable coexistence state between\npunishing investors and trustworthy trustees. Furthermore, an intermediate\nfraction of investors can better promote the evolution of trust when the\npunishment intensity is low. For more intensive punishment, however, a higher\nfraction of investors can be more efficient to elevate the trust level. In\naddition, we reveal that appropriate increase of the punishment intensity can\nenlarge the attraction domain of the coexistence state.",

However, offloading a task to the nearest\nMEC server may not be the optimal solution due to the limited computing\nresources of the MEC server. Thus, jointly optimizing the offloading decision\nand resource management is critical, but yet to be explored. Here, offloading\ndecision refers to where to offload a task and resource management implies how\nmuch computing resource in an MEC server is allocated to a task. By considering\nthe waiting time of a task in the communication and computing queues (which are\nignored by most of the existing works) as well as tasks priorities, we propose\nthe \\ul{D}eep reinforcement l\\ul{E}arning based offloading de\\ul{C}ision and\nr\\ul{E}source manageme\\ul{NT} (DECENT) algorithm, which leverages the advantage\nactor critic method to optimize the offloading decision and computing resource\nallocation for each arriving task in real-time such that the cumulative\nweighted response time can be minimized.

Due to the appeal of data-driven optimization,\nthese problems have increasingly been approached using graph learning methods.\nAmong them, the Multi-Commodity Network Flow (MCNF) problem is of particular\ninterest given its generality, since it concerns the distribution of multiple\nflows (also called demands) of different sizes between several sources and\nsinks. The widely-used objective that we focus on is the maximum utilization of\nany link in the network, given traffic demands and a routing strategy.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel approach based on Graph Neural Networks\n(GNNs) for the MCNF problem which uses distinctly parametrized message\nfunctions along each link, akin to a relational model where all edge types are\nunique. We show that our proposed method yields substantial gains over existing\ngraph learning methods that constrain the routing unnecessarily. We extensively\nevaluate the proposed approach by means of an Internet routing case study using\n17 Service Provider topologies and two flow routing schemes. We find that, in\nmany networks, an MLP is competitive with a generic GNN that does not use our\nmechanism.

Although the\nlearning of structured graphical models has a long history, much recent work in\nunsupervised modelling has instead emphasised flexible deep-network-based\ngeneration, either transforming independent latent generators to model complex\ndata or assuming that distinct observed variables are derived from different\nlatent nodes. Here, we extend the output of amortised variational inference to\nincorporate structured factors over multiple variables, able to capture the\nobservation-induced posterior dependence between latents that results from\n\"explaining away\" and thus allow complex observations to depend on multiple\nnodes of a structured graph. We show that appropriately parameterised factors\ncan be combined efficiently with variational message passing in elaborate\ngraphical structures. We instantiate the framework based on Gaussian Process\nFactor Analysis models, and empirically evaluate its improvement over existing\nmethods on synthetic data with known generative processes.

    "abstract": "In vulnerability assessments, software component-based CVE attribution is a\ncommon method to identify possibly vulnerable systems at scale. However, such\nversion-centric approaches yield high false-positive rates for binary\ndistributed Linux kernels in firmware images. Not filtering included vulnerable\ncomponents is a reason for unreliable matching, as heterogeneous hardware\nproperties, modularity, and numerous development streams result in a plethora\nof vendor-customized builds. To make a step towards increased result\nreliability while retaining scalability of the analysis method, we enrich\nversion-based CVE matching with kernel-specific build data from binary images\nusing automated static firmware analysis.

    "abstract": "Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) is one of the fundamental\nproblems in autonomous mobile robots where a robot needs to reconstruct a\npreviously unseen environment while simultaneously localising itself with\nrespect to the map. In particular, Visual-SLAM uses various sensors from the\nmobile robot for collecting and sensing a representation of the map.\nTraditionally, geometric model-based techniques were used to tackle the SLAM\nproblem, which tends to be error-prone under challenging environments. Recent\nadvancements in computer vision, such as deep learning techniques, have\nprovided a data-driven approach to tackle the Visual-SLAM problem. This review\nsummarises recent advancements in the Visual-SLAM domain using various\nlearning-based methods. We begin by providing a concise overview of the\ngeometric model-based approaches, followed by technical reviews on the current\nparadigms in SLAM. Then, we present the various learning-based approaches to\ncollecting sensory inputs from mobile robots and performing scene\nunderstanding. The current paradigms in deep-learning-based semantic\nunderstanding are discussed and placed under the context of Visual-SLAM.\nFinally, we discuss challenges and further opportunities in the direction of\nlearning-based approaches in Visual-SLAM.",

    "abstract": "Deploying machine learning models on mobile devices has gained increasing\nattention. To tackle the model generalization problem with the limitations of\nhardware resources on the device, the device model needs to be lightweight by\ntechniques such as model compression from the cloud model. However, the major\nobstacle to improve the device model generalization is the distribution shift\nbetween the data of cloud and device models, since the data distribution on\ndevice model often changes over time (e.g., users might have different\npreferences in recommendation system). Although real-time fine-tuning and\ndistillation method take this situation into account, these methods require\non-device training, which are practically infeasible due to the low\ncomputational power and a lack of real-time labeled samples on the device.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel task-agnostic framework, named MetaNetwork,\nfor generating adaptive device model parameters from cloud without on-device\ntraining. Specifically, our MetaNetwork is deployed on cloud and consists of\nMetaGenerator and MetaStabilizer modules. The MetaGenerator is designed to\nlearn a mapping function from samples to model parameters, and it can generate\nand deliver the adaptive parameters to the device based on samples uploaded\nfrom the device to the cloud. The MetaStabilizer aims to reduce the oscillation\nof the MetaGenerator, accelerate the convergence and improve the model\nperformance during both training and inference. We evaluate our method on two\ntasks with three datasets. Extensive experiments show that MetaNetwork can\nachieve competitive performances in different modalities.",

    "abstract": "Extensive evidence has demonstrated that deep neural networks (DNNs) are\nvulnerable to backdoor attacks, which motivates the development of backdoor\ndetection methods. Existing backdoor detection methods are typically tailored\nfor backdoor attacks with individual specific types (e.g., patch-based or\nperturbation-based). However, adversaries are likely to generate multiple types\nof backdoor attacks in practice, which challenges the current detection\nstrategies. Based on the fact that adversarial perturbations are highly\ncorrelated with trigger patterns, this paper proposes the Adaptive Perturbation\nGeneration (APG) framework to detect multiple types of backdoor attacks by\nadaptively injecting adversarial perturbations. Since different trigger\npatterns turn out to show highly diverse behaviors under the same adversarial\nperturbations, we first design the global-to-local strategy to fit the multiple\ntypes of backdoor triggers via adjusting the region and budget of attacks. To\nfurther increase the efficiency of perturbation injection, we introduce a\ngradient-guided mask generation strategy to search for the optimal regions for\nadversarial attacks.

    "abstract": "Learning new tasks and skills in succession without losing prior learning\n(i.e., catastrophic forgetting) is a computational challenge for both\nartificial and biological neural networks, yet artificial systems struggle to\nachieve parity with their biological analogues. Mammalian brains employ\nnumerous neural operations in support of continual learning during sleep. These\nare ripe for artificial adaptation. Here, we investigate how modeling three\ndistinct components of mammalian sleep together affects continual learning in\nartificial neural networks: (1) a veridical memory replay process observed\nduring non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep; (2) a generative memory replay\nprocess linked to REM sleep; and (3) a synaptic downscaling process which has\nbeen proposed to tune signal-to-noise ratios and support neural upkeep. We find\nbenefits from the inclusion of all three sleep components when evaluating\nperformance on a continual learning CIFAR-100 image classification benchmark.\nMaximum accuracy improved during training and catastrophic forgetting was\nreduced during later tasks. While some catastrophic forgetting persisted over\nthe course of network training, higher levels of synaptic downscaling lead to\nbetter retention of early tasks and further facilitated the recovery of early\ntask accuracy during subsequent training. One key takeaway is that there is a\ntrade-off at hand when considering the level of synaptic downscaling to use -\nmore aggressive downscaling better protects early tasks, but less downscaling\nenhances the ability to learn new tasks. Intermediate levels can strike a\nbalance with the highest overall accuracies during training.

    "abstract": "The occurrence of West Nile Virus (WNV) represents one of the most common\nmosquito-borne zoonosis viral infections. Its circulation is usually associated\nwith climatic and environmental conditions suitable for vector proliferation\nand virus replication. On top of that, several statistical models have been\ndeveloped to shape and forecast WNV circulation: in particular, the recent\nmassive availability of Earth Observation (EO) data, coupled with the\ncontinuous advances in the field of Artificial Intelligence, offer valuable\nopportunities.\nIn this paper, we seek to predict WNV circulation by feeding Deep Neural\nNetworks (DNNs) with satellite images, which have been extensively shown to\nhold environmental and climatic features. Notably, while previous approaches\nanalyze each geographical site independently, we propose a spatial-aware\napproach that considers also the characteristics of close sites. Specifically,\nwe build upon Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to aggregate features from\nneighbouring places, and further extend these modules to consider multiple\nrelations, such as the difference in temperature and soil moisture between two\nsites, as well as the geographical distance. Moreover, we inject time-related\ninformation directly into the model to take into account the seasonality of\nvirus spread.\nWe design an experimental setting that combines satellite images - from\nLandsat and Sentinel missions - with ground truth observations of WNV\ncirculation in Italy. We show that our proposed Multi-Adjacency Graph Attention\nNetwork (MAGAT) consistently leads to higher performance when paired with an\nappropriate pre-training stage.

    "title": "ErgoExplorer: Interactive Ergonomic Risk Assessment from Video  Collections",
    "abstract": "Ergonomic risk assessment is now, due to an increased awareness, carried out\nmore often than in the past. The conventional risk assessment evaluation, based\non expert-assisted observation of the workplaces and manually filling in score\ntables, is still predominant. Data analysis is usually done with a focus on\ncritical moments, although without the support of contextual information and\nchanges over time. In this paper we introduce ErgoExplorer, a system for the\ninteractive visual analysis of risk assessment data. In contrast to the current\npractice, we focus on data that span across multiple actions and multiple\nworkers while keeping all contextual information. Data is automatically\nextracted from video streams. Based on carefully investigated analysis tasks,\nwe introduce new views and their corresponding interactions. These views also\nincorporate domain-specific score tables to guarantee an easy adoption by\ndomain experts. All views are integrated into ErgoExplorer, which relies on\ncoordinated multiple views to facilitate analysis through interaction.\nErgoExplorer makes it possible for the first time to examine complex\nrelationships between risk assessments of individual body parts over long\nsessions that span multiple operations. The newly introduced approach supports\nanalysis and exploration at several levels of detail, ranging from a general\noverview, down to inspecting individual frames in the video stream, if\nnecessary. We illustrate the usefulness of the newly proposed approach applying\nit to several datasets.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, significant progress has been made in transportation\nelectrification. And lithium-ion batteries (LIB), as the main energy storage\ndevices, have received widespread attention. Accurately predicting the state of\nhealth (SOH) can not only ease the anxiety of users about the battery life but\nalso provide important information for the management of the battery. This\npaper presents a prediction method for SOH based on Vision Transformer (ViT)\nmodel. First, discrete charging data of a predefined voltage range is used as\nan input data matrix. Then, the cycle features of the battery are captured by\nthe ViT which can obtain the global features, and the SOH is obtained by\ncombining the cycle features with the full connection (FC) layer. At the same\ntime, transfer learning (TL) is introduced, and the prediction model based on\nsource task battery training is further fine-tuned according to the early cycle\ndata of the target task battery to provide an accurate prediction. Experiments\nshow that our method can obtain better feature expression compared with\nexisting deep learning methods so that better prediction effect and transfer\neffect can be achieved.",

    "abstract": "Robots working in real environments need to adapt to unexpected changes to\navoid failures. This is an open and complex challenge that requires robots to\ntimely predict and identify the causes of failures to prevent them. In this\npaper, we present a causal method that will enable robots to predict when\nerrors are likely to occur and prevent them from happening by executing a\ncorrective action. First, we propose a causal-based method to detect the\ncause-effect relationships between task executions and their consequences by\nlearning a causal Bayesian network (BN). The obtained model is transferred from\nsimulated data to real scenarios to demonstrate the robustness and\ngeneralization of the obtained models. Based on the causal BN, the robot can\npredict if and why the executed action will succeed or not in its current\nstate. Then, we introduce a novel method that finds the closest state\nalternatives through a contrastive Breadth-First-Search if the current action\nwas predicted to fail. We evaluate our approach for the problem of stacking\ncubes in two cases; a) single stacks (stacking one cube) and; b) multiple\nstacks (stacking three cubes). In the single-stack case, our method was able to\nreduce the error rate by 97%. We also show that our approach can scale to\ncapture multiple actions in one model, allowing to measure timely shifted\naction effects, such as the impact of an imprecise stack of the first cube on\nthe stacking success of the third cube. For these complex situations, our model\nwas able to prevent around 75% of the stacking errors, even for the challenging\nmultiple-stack scenario. Thus, demonstrating that our method is able to\nexplain, predict, and prevent execution failures, which even scales to complex\nscenarios that require an understanding of how the action history impacts\nfuture actions.",

    "abstract": "Cybersickness can be characterized by nausea, vertigo, headache, eye strain,\nand other discomforts when using virtual reality (VR) systems. The previously\nreported machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms for detecting\n(classification) and predicting (regression) VR cybersickness use black-box\nmodels; thus, they lack explainability. Moreover, VR sensors generate a massive\namount of data, resulting in complex and large models. Therefore, having\ninherent explainability in cybersickness detection models can significantly\nimprove the model's trustworthiness and provide insight into why and how the\nML/DL model arrived at a specific decision. To address this issue, we present\nthree explainable machine learning (xML) models to detect and predict\ncybersickness: 1) explainable boosting machine (EBM), 2) decision tree (DT),\nand 3) logistic regression (LR). We evaluate xML-based models with publicly\navailable physiological and gameplay datasets for cybersickness. The results\nshow that the EBM can detect cybersickness with an accuracy of 99.75% and\n94.10% for the physiological and gameplay datasets, respectively. On the other\nhand, while predicting the cybersickness, EBM resulted in a Root Mean Square\nError (RMSE) of 0.071 for the physiological dataset and 0.27 for the gameplay\ndataset. Furthermore, the EBM-based global explanation reveals exposure length,\nrotation, and acceleration as key features causing cybersickness in the\ngameplay dataset. In contrast, galvanic skin responses and heart rate are most\nsignificant in the physiological dataset. Our results also suggest that\nEBM-based local explanation can identify cybersickness-causing factors for\nindividual samples. We believe the proposed xML-based cybersickness detection\nmethod can help future researchers understand, analyze, and design simpler\ncybersickness detection and reduction models.",

In this paper, we present a novel deep learning model\ntermed DLF to explore the HaE classification through fractal method from the\nperspective of language. The motivation is that (1): HaE can be naturally\nregarded as a kind of time series; (2): the meaning of HaE is driven by word\narrangement. Specifically, first we employ BERT to vectorize HaE. Then, we\npropose a new multifractal method termed HmF-DFA to calculate HaE fractal\nseries by analyzing the HaE vector who is regarded as a time series.

We launch the experiment on the basis of their HAZOP reports.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our DLF classifier is satisfactory and\npromising, the proposed HmF-DFA and HGNN are effective, and the introduction of\nlanguage fractal into HaE is feasible.

In this paper, we\nintroduce the DECK (DEpression ChecKlist), depression-specific model\nbehavioural tests that allow better interpretability and improve\ngeneralizability of BERT classifiers in depression domain. We create 23 tests\nto evaluate BERT, RoBERTa and ALBERT depression classifiers on three datasets,\ntwo Twitter-based and one clinical interview-based. Our evaluation shows that\nthese models: 1) are robust to certain gender-sensitive variations in text; 2)\nrely on the important depressive language marker of the increased use of first\nperson pronouns; 3) fail to detect some other depression symptoms like suicidal\nideation. We also demonstrate that DECK tests can be used to incorporate\nsymptom-specific information in the training data and consistently improve\ngeneralizability of all three BERT models, with an out-of-distribution F1-score\nincrease of up to 53.93%.",

    "abstract": "The spread of hate speech on social media space is currently a serious issue.\nThe undemanding access to the enormous amount of information being generated on\nthese platforms has led people to post and react with toxic content that\noriginates violence. Though efforts have been made toward detecting and\nrestraining such content online, it is still challenging to identify it\naccurately. Deep learning based solutions have been at the forefront of\nidentifying hateful content. However, the factors such as the context-dependent\nnature of hate speech, the intention of the user, undesired biases, etc. make\nthis process overcritical. In this work, we deeply explore a wide range of\nchallenges in automatic hate speech detection by presenting a hierarchical\norganization of these problems. We focus on challenges faced by machine\nlearning or deep learning based solutions to hate speech identification. At the\ntop level, we distinguish between data level, model level, and human level\nchallenges. We further provide an exhaustive analysis of each level of the\nhierarchy with examples. This survey will help researchers to design their\nsolutions more efficiently in the domain of hate speech detection.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a simple yet effective interpolation-based data\naugmentation approach termed DoubleMix, to improve the robustness of models in\ntext classification. DoubleMix first leverages a couple of simple augmentation\noperations to generate several perturbed samples for each training data, and\nthen uses the perturbed data and original data to carry out a two-step\ninterpolation in the hidden space of neural models. Concretely, it first mixes\nup the perturbed data to a synthetic sample and then mixes up the original data\nand the synthetic perturbed data. DoubleMix enhances models' robustness by\nlearning the \"shifted\" features in hidden space. On six text classification\nbenchmark datasets, our approach outperforms several popular text augmentation\nmethods including token-level, sentence-level, and hidden-level data\naugmentation techniques. Also, experiments in low-resource settings show our\napproach consistently improves models' performance when the training data is\nscarce. Extensive ablation studies and case studies confirm that each component\nof our approach contributes to the final performance and show that our approach\nexhibits superior performance on challenging counterexamples. Additionally,\nvisual analysis shows that text features generated by our approach are highly\ninterpretable. Our code for this paper can be found at\nhttps://github.com/declare-lab/DoubleMix.git.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Deepfake has drawn considerable public attention due to security\nand privacy concerns in social media digital forensics. As the wildly spreading\nDeepfake videos on the Internet become more realistic, traditional detection\ntechniques have failed in distinguishing between the real and fake. Most\nexisting deep learning methods mainly focus on local features and relations\nwithin the face image using convolutional neural networks as a backbone.\nHowever, local features and relations are insufficient for model training to\nlearn enough general information for Deepfake detection. Therefore, the\nexisting Deepfake detection methods have reached a bottleneck to further\nimproving the detection performance. To address this issue, we propose a deep\nconvolutional Transformer to incorporate the decisive image features both\nlocally and globally. Specifically, we apply convolutional pooling and\nre-attention to enrich the extracted features and enhance the efficacy.\nMoreover, we employ the barely discussed image keyframes in model training for\nperformance improvement and visualize the feature quantity gap between the key\nand normal image frames caused by video compression. We finally illustrate the\ntransferability with extensive experiments on several Deepfake benchmark\ndatasets.

The misalignment of\nmulti-channel time series data may occur for a variety of reasons, such as\nmissing data, varying sampling rates, or inconsistent collection times. We\nconsider multi-channel time series data collected from the MIT SuperCloud High\nPerformance Computing (HPC) center, where different job start times and varying\nrun times of HPC jobs result in misaligned data. This misalignment makes it\nchallenging to build AI/ML approaches for tasks such as compute workload\nclassification. Building on previous supervised classification work with the\nMIT SuperCloud Dataset, we address the alignment problem via three broad, low\noverhead approaches: sampling a fixed subset from a full time series,\nperforming summary statistics on a full time series, and sampling a subset of\ncoefficients from time series mapped to the frequency domain. Our best\nperforming models achieve a classification accuracy greater than 95%,\noutperforming previous approaches to multi-channel time series classification\nwith the MIT SuperCloud Dataset by 5%. These results indicate our low overhead\napproaches to solving the alignment problem, in conjunction with standard\nmachine learning techniques, are able to achieve high levels of classification\naccuracy, and serve as a baseline for future approaches to addressing the\nalignment problem, such as kernel methods.",

Their understanding of\neveryday texts is limited, which prevents them from taking an active role in\nsociety and making informed decisions regarding healthcare, legal\nrepresentation, or democratic choice. Lexical simplification is a natural\nlanguage processing task that aims to make text understandable to everyone by\nreplacing complex vocabulary and expressions with simpler ones, while\npreserving the original meaning. It has attracted considerable attention in the\nlast 20 years, and fully automatic lexical simplification systems have been\nproposed for various languages. The main obstacle for the progress of the field\nis the absence of high-quality datasets for building and evaluating lexical\nsimplification systems. We present a new benchmark dataset for lexical\nsimplification in English, Spanish, and (Brazilian) Portuguese, and provide\ndetails about data selection and annotation procedures. This is the first\ndataset that offers a direct comparison of lexical simplification systems for\nthree languages. To showcase the usability of the dataset, we adapt two\nstate-of-the-art lexical simplification systems with differing architectures\n(neural vs.\\ non-neural) to all three languages (English, Spanish, and\nBrazilian Portuguese) and evaluate their performances on our new dataset. For a\nfairer comparison, we use several evaluation measures which capture varied\naspects of the systems' efficacy, and discuss their strengths and weaknesses.\nWe find a state-of-the-art neural lexical simplification system outperforms a\nstate-of-the-art non-neural lexical simplification system in all three\nlanguages. More importantly, we find that the state-of-the-art neural lexical\nsimplification systems perform significantly better for English than for\nSpanish and Portuguese.",

In this paper,\nwe show that the bottleneck in the adaptive choice of samples for training\nefficiency is the behavior of the tail distribution of the numerical residual.\nThus, we propose the Residual-Quantile Adjustment (RQA) method for a better\nweight choice for each training sample.

Conventional approaches for most autonomous driving algorithms\nperform detection, segmentation, tracking, etc., in a front or perspective\nview. As sensor configurations get more complex, integrating multi-source\ninformation from different sensors and representing features in a unified view\ncome of vital importance. BEV perception inherits several advantages, as\nrepresenting surrounding scenes in BEV is intuitive and fusion-friendly; and\nrepresenting objects in BEV is most desirable for subsequent modules as in\nplanning and/or control. The core problems for BEV perception lie in (a) how to\nreconstruct the lost 3D information via view transformation from perspective\nview to BEV; (b) how to acquire ground truth annotations in BEV grid; (c) how\nto formulate the pipeline to incorporate features from different sources and\nviews; and (d) how to adapt and generalize algorithms as sensor configurations\nvary across different scenarios.

The algorithm we present utilises a representation of words\nas synchronous deterministic transducers that lend themselves to efficient\n(quadratic in the size of the alphabet) multiplication in the free band. This\nrepresentation also provides a means of finding the short-lex least word\nrepresenting a given free band element with quadratic complexity.",

    "abstract": "The recently introduced weakly disentangled representations proposed to relax\nsome constraints of the previous definitions of disentanglement, in exchange\nfor more flexibility. However, at the moment, weak disentanglement can only be\nachieved by increasing the amount of supervision as the number of factors of\nvariations of the data increase. In this paper, we introduce modular\nrepresentations for weak disentanglement, a novel method that allows to keep\nthe amount of supervised information constant with respect the number of\ngenerative factors. The experiments shows that models using modular\nrepresentations can increase their performance with respect to previous work\nwithout the need of additional supervision.",

    "abstract": "A number of different performance metrics are commonly used in the machine\nlearning literature for classification systems that output categorical\ndecisions. Some of the most common ones are accuracy, total error (one minus\naccuracy), balanced accuracy, balanced total error (one minus balanced\naccuracy), F-score, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). In this\ndocument, we review the definition of these metrics and compare them with the\nexpected cost (EC), a metric introduced in every statistical learning course\nbut rarely used in the machine learning literature. We show that the empirical\nestimate of the EC is a generalized version of both the total error and\nbalanced total error. Further, we show its relation with F-score and MCC and\nargue that EC is superior to them, being more general, simpler, intuitive and\nwell motivated. We highlight some issues with the F-score and the MCC that make\nthem suboptimal metrics. While not explained in the current version of this\nmanuscript, where we focus exclusively on metrics that are computed over hard\ndecisions, the EC has the additional advantage of being a great tool to measure\ncalibration of a system's scores and allows users to make optimal decisions\ngiven a set of posteriors for each class.

    "abstract": "In the recent years, scientific workflows gained more and more popularity. In\nscientific workflows, tasks are typically treated as black boxes. Dealing with\ntheir complex interrelations to identify optimization potentials and\nbottlenecks is therefore inherently hard. The progress of a scientific workflow\ndepends on several factors, including the available input data, the available\ncomputational power, and the I/O and network bandwidth. Here, we tackle the\nproblem of predicting the workflow progress with very low overhead. To this\nend, we look at suitable formalizations for the key parameters and their\ninteractions which are sufficiently flexible to describe the input data\nconsumption, the computational effort and the output production of the\nworkflow's tasks. At the same time they allow for computationally simple and\nfast performance predictions, including a bottleneck analysis over the workflow\nruntime. A piecewise-defined bottleneck function is derived from the discrete\nintersections of the task models' limiting functions. This allows to estimate\npotential performance gains from overcoming the bottlenecks and can be used as\na basis for optimized resource allocation and workflow execution.",

For example, if we have a partial coloring of a graph, how\nhard is it to turn it into a proper coloring?\nIn prior work (SIROCCO 2022), this question was formalized and studied from\nthe perspective of mending radius: if there is a hole that we need to patch,\nhow far do we need to modify the solution? In this work, we investigate a\ncomplementary notion of mending volume: how many nodes need to be modified to\npatch a hole?\nWe focus on the case of locally checkable labeling problems (LCLs) in trees,\nand show that already in this setting there are two infinite hierarchies of\nproblems: for infinitely many values $0 < \\alpha \\le 1$, there is an LCL\nproblem with mending volume $\\Theta(n^\\alpha)$, and for infinitely many values\n$k \\ge 1$, there is an LCL problem with mending volume $\\Theta(\\log^k n)$.\nHence the mendability of LCL problems on trees is a much more fine-grained\nquestion than what one would expect based on the mending radius alone.\nWe define three variants of the theme: (1) existential mending volume, i.e.,\nhow many nodes need to be modified, (2) expected mending volume, i.e., how many\nnodes we need to explore to find a patch if we use randomness, and (3)\ndeterministic mending volume, i.e., how many nodes we need to explore if we use\na deterministic algorithm.

    "abstract": "Optimal control (OC) using inverse dynamics provides numerical benefits such\nas coarse optimization, cheaper computation of derivatives, and a high\nconvergence rate. However, in order to take advantage of these benefits in\nmodel predictive control (MPC) for legged robots, it is crucial to handle its\nlarge number of equality constraints efficiently. To accomplish this, we first\n(i) propose a novel approach to handle equality constraints based on nullspace\nparametrization. Our approach balances optimality, and both dynamics and\nequality-constraint feasibility appropriately, which increases the basin of\nattraction to good local minima. To do so, we then (ii) adapt our\nfeasibility-driven search by incorporating a merit function. Furthermore, we\nintroduce (iii) a condensed formulation of the inverse dynamics that considers\narbitrary actuator models. We also develop (iv) a novel MPC based on inverse\ndynamics within a perception locomotion framework. Finally, we present (v) a\ntheoretical comparison of optimal control with the forward and inverse\ndynamics, and evaluate both numerically. Our approach enables the first\napplication of inverse-dynamics MPC on hardware, resulting in state-of-the-art\ndynamic climbing on the ANYmal robot. We benchmark it over a wide range of\nrobotics problems and generate agile and complex maneuvers. We show the\ncomputational reduction of our nullspace resolution and condensed formulation\n(up to 47.3%).

    "abstract": "Autism, also known as Autism Spectrum Disorder (or ASD), is a neurological\ndisorder. Its main symptoms include difficulty in (verbal and/or non-verbal)\ncommunication, and rigid/repetitive behavior. These symptoms are often\nindistinguishable from a normal (control) individual, due to which this\ndisorder remains undiagnosed in early childhood leading to delayed treatment.\nSince the learning curve is steep during the initial age, an early diagnosis of\nautism could allow to take adequate interventions at the right time, which\nmight positively affect the growth of an autistic child. Further, the\ntraditional methods of autism diagnosis require multiple visits to a\nspecialized psychiatrist, however this process can be time-consuming. In this\npaper, we present a learning based approach to automate autism diagnosis using\nsimple and small action video clips of subjects. This task is particularly\nchallenging because the amount of annotated data available is small, and the\nvariations among samples from the two categories (ASD and control) are\ngenerally indistinguishable. This is also evident from poor performance of a\nbinary classifier learned using the cross-entropy loss on top of a baseline\nencoder. To address this, we adopt contrastive feature learning in both self\nsupervised and supervised learning frameworks, and show that these can lead to\na significant increase in the prediction accuracy of a binary classifier on\nthis task. We further validate this by conducting thorough experimental\nanalyses under different set-ups on two publicly available datasets.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the achievable region and precoder design for\nmultiple access wiretap (MAC-WT) channels, where each user transmits both\nsecret and open (i.e., non-confidential) messages. All these messages are\nintended for the legitimate receiver (or Bob for brevity) and the eavesdropper\n(Eve) is interested only in the secret messages of all users. By allowing users\nwith zero secret message rate to act as conventional MAC channel users with no\nwiretapping, we show that the achievable region of the discrete memoryless (DM)\nMAC-WT channel given in [1] can be enlarged. In [1], the achievability was\nproven by considering the two-user case, making it possible to prove a key\nauxiliary lemma by directly using the Fourier-Motzkin elimination procedure.\nHowever, this approach does not generalize to the case with any number of\nusers. In this paper, we provide a new region that generally enlarges that in\n[1] and provide general achievability proof. Furthermore, we consider the\nGaussian vector (GV) MAC-WT channel and maximize the sum secrecy rate by\nprecoder design. Although this non-convex problem can be solved by the\nmajorization minimization (MM) technique, this suffers from an extremely high\ncomputational complexity. Instead, we propose a simultaneous diagonalization\nbased low-complexity (SDLC) method to maximize the secrecy rate of a simple\nsingle-user wiretap channel, and then use this method to iteratively optimize\nthe covariance matrix of each user in the GV MAC-WT channel at hand. Simulation\nresults show that, compared with existing approaches, the SDLC scheme achieves\nsimilar secrecy performance but requires much lower complexity.

    "abstract": "Thanks to the rapid evolvement of robotic technologies, robot mowing is\nemerging to liberate humans from the tedious and time-consuming landscape work.\nTraditionally, robot mowing is perceived as a \"Coverage Path Planning\" problem,\nwith a simplification that converts non-convex obstacles into convex obstacles.\nBesides, the converted obstacles are commonly dilated by the robot's\ncircumcircle for collision avoidance. However when applied to robot mowing, an\nobstacle in a lawn is usually non-convex, imagine a garden on the lawn, such\nthat the mentioned obstacle processing methods would fill in some concave areas\nso that they are not accessible to the robot anymore and hence produce\ninescapable uncut areas along the lawn edge, which dulls the landscape's\nelegance and provokes rework. To shrink the uncut area around the lawn edge we\nhereby reframe the problem into a brand new problem, named the \"Edge Coverage\nPath Planning\" problem that is dedicated to path planning with the objective to\ncover the edge. Correspondingly, we propose two planning methods, the \"big and\nsmall disk\" and the \"sliding chopstick\" planning method to tackle the problem\nby leveraging image morphological processing and computational geometry skills.\nBy validation, our proposed methods can outperform the traditional\n\"dilation-by-circumcircle\" method.",

    "abstract": "Predicting traffic conditions is tremendously challenging since every road is\nhighly dependent on each other, both spatially and temporally. Recently, to\ncapture this spatial and temporal dependency, specially designed architectures\nsuch as graph convolutional networks and temporal convolutional networks have\nbeen introduced. While there has been remarkable progress in traffic\nforecasting, we found that deep-learning-based traffic forecasting models still\nfail in certain patterns, mainly in event situations (e.g., rapid speed drops).\nAlthough it is commonly accepted that these failures are due to unpredictable\nnoise, we found that these failures can be corrected by considering previous\nfailures. Specifically, we observe autocorrelated errors in these failures,\nwhich indicates that some predictable information remains. In this study, to\ncapture the correlation of errors, we introduce ResCAL, a residual estimation\nmodule for traffic forecasting, as a widely applicable add-on module to\nexisting traffic forecasting models. Our ResCAL calibrates the prediction of\nthe existing models in real time by estimating future errors using previous\nerrors and graph signals. Extensive experiments on METR-LA and PEMS-BAY\ndemonstrate that our ResCAL can correctly capture the correlation of errors and\ncorrect the failures of various traffic forecasting models in event situations.",

    "abstract": "As panoptic segmentation provides a prediction for every pixel in input,\nnon-standard and unseen objects systematically lead to wrong outputs. However,\nin safety-critical settings, robustness against out-of-distribution samples and\ncorner cases is crucial to avoid dangerous behaviors, such as ignoring an\nanimal or a lost cargo on the road. Since driving datasets cannot contain\nenough data points to properly sample the long tail of the underlying\ndistribution, a method must deal with unknown and unseen scenarios to be\ndeployed safely. Previous methods targeted part of this issue, by\nre-identifying already seen unlabeled objects. In this work, we broaden the\nscope proposing holistic segmentation: a task to identify and separate unseen\nunknown objects into instances, without learning from unknowns, while\nperforming panoptic segmentation of known classes. We tackle this new problem\nwith U3HS, which first finds unknowns as highly uncertain regions, then\nclusters the corresponding instance-aware embeddings into individual objects.\nBy doing so, for the first time in panoptic segmentation with unknown objects,\nour U3HS is not trained with unknown data, thus leaving the settings\nunconstrained with respect to the type of objects and allowing for a holistic\nscene understanding. Extensive experiments and comparisons on two public\ndatasets, namely Cityscapes and Lost&Found as a transfer, demonstrate the\neffectiveness of U3HS in the challenging task of holistic segmentation, with\ncompetitive closed-set panoptic segmentation performance.",

    "abstract": "Chromosome analysis and identification from metaphase images is a critical\npart of cytogenetics based medical diagnosis. It is mainly used for identifying\nconstitutional, prenatal and acquired abnormalities in the diagnosis of genetic\ndiseases and disorders. The process of identification of chromosomes from\nmetaphase is a tedious one and requires trained personnel and several hours to\nperform. Challenge exists especially in handling touching, overlapping and\nclustered chromosomes in metaphase images, which if not segmented properly\nwould result in wrong classification. We propose a method to automate the\nprocess of detection and segmentation of chromosomes from a given metaphase\nimage, and in using them to classify through a Deep CNN architecture to know\nthe chromosome type. We have used two methods to handle the separation of\noverlapping chromosomes found in metaphases - one method involving watershed\nalgorithm followed by autoencoders and the other a method purely based on\nwatershed algorithm. These methods involve a combination of automation and very\nminimal manual effort to perform the segmentation, which produces the output.\nThe manual effort ensures that human intuition is taken into consideration,\nespecially in handling touching, overlapping and cluster chromosomes. Upon\nsegmentation, individual chromosome images are then classified into their\nrespective classes with 95.75\\% accuracy using a Deep CNN model. Further, we\nimpart a distribution strategy to classify these chromosomes from the given\noutput (which typically could consist of 46 individual images in a normal\nscenario for human beings) into its individual classes with an accuracy of\n98\\%.

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of face forgery technology, deepfake videos have\nattracted widespread attention in digital media. Perpetrators heavily utilize\nthese videos to spread disinformation and make misleading statements. Most\nexisting methods for deepfake detection mainly focus on texture features, which\nare likely to be impacted by external fluctuations, such as illumination and\nnoise. Besides, detection methods based on facial landmarks are more robust\nagainst external variables but lack sufficient detail. Thus, how to effectively\nmine distinctive features in the spatial, temporal, and frequency domains and\nfuse them with facial landmarks for forgery video detection is still an open\nquestion. To this end, we propose a Landmark Enhanced Multimodal Graph Neural\nNetwork (LEM-GNN) based on multiple modalities' information and geometric\nfeatures of facial landmarks. Specifically, at the frame level, we have\ndesigned a fusion mechanism to mine a joint representation of the spatial and\nfrequency domain elements while introducing geometric facial features to\nenhance the robustness of the model. At the video level, we first regard each\nframe in a video as a node in a graph and encode temporal information into the\nedges of the graph. Then, by applying the message passing mechanism of the\ngraph neural network (GNN), the multimodal feature will be effectively combined\nto obtain a comprehensive representation of the video forgery.

However, in healthcare where the number of contributing\ninstitutions are likely not of a colossal scale, computing exact SVs is still\nexorbitantly expensive, but not impossible. For such settings, we propose an\nefficient SV computation technique called SaFE (Shapley Value for Federated\nLearning using Ensembling).

    "abstract": "One of the challenging input settings for visual servoing is when the initial\nand goal camera views are far apart. Such settings are difficult because the\nwide baseline can cause drastic changes in object appearance and cause\nocclusions. This paper presents a novel self-supervised visual servoing method\nfor wide baseline images which does not require 3D ground truth supervision.\nExisting approaches that regress absolute camera pose with respect to an object\nrequire 3D ground truth data of the object in the forms of 3D bounding boxes or\nmeshes. We learn a coherent visual representation by leveraging a geometric\nproperty called 3D equivariance-the representation is transformed in a\npredictable way as a function of 3D transformation. To ensure that the\nfeature-space is faithful to the underlying geodesic space, a geodesic\npreserving constraint is applied in conjunction with the equivariance. We\ndesign a Siamese network that can effectively enforce these two geometric\nproperties without requiring 3D supervision. With the learned model, the\nrelative transformation can be inferred simply by following the gradient in the\nlearned space and used as feedback for closed-loop visual servoing. Our method\nis evaluated on objects from the YCB dataset, showing meaningful outperformance\non a visual servoing task, or object alignment task with respect to\nstate-of-the-art approaches that use 3D supervision.

While plenty of works attempt to extend the\nunconditional generative models and achieve some level of controllability, it\nis still challenging to ensure multi-view consistency, especially in large\nposes. In this work, we propose a 3D portrait generation network that produces\n3D consistent portraits while being controllable according to semantic\nparameters regarding pose, identity, expression and lighting. The generative\nnetwork uses neural scene representation to model portraits in 3D, whose\ngeneration is guided by a parametric face model that supports explicit control.\nWhile the latent disentanglement can be further enhanced by contrasting images\nwith partially different attributes, there still exists noticeable\ninconsistency in non-face areas, e.g., hair and background, when animating\nexpressions. We solve this by proposing a volume blending strategy in which we\nform a composite output by blending the dynamic and static radiance fields,\nwith two parts segmented from the jointly learned semantic field. Our method\noutperforms prior arts in extensive experiments, producing realistic portraits\nwith vivid expression in natural lighting when viewed in free viewpoint.

    "abstract": "Today's large-scale algorithmic and automated deployment of decision-making\nsystems threatens to exclude marginalized communities. Thus, the emergent\ndanger comes from the effectiveness and the propensity of such systems to\nreplicate, reinforce, or amplify harmful existing discriminatory acts.\nAlgorithmic bias exposes a deeply entrenched encoding of a range of unwanted\nbiases that can have profound real-world effects that manifest in domains from\nemployment, to housing, to healthcare. The last decade of research and examples\non these effects further underscores the need to examine any claim of a\nvalue-neutral technology. This work examines the intersection of algorithmic\nbias in consumer mobile health technologies (mHealth). We include mHealth, a\nterm used to describe mobile technology and associated sensors to provide\nhealthcare solutions through patient journeys. We also include mental and\nbehavioral health (mental and physiological) as part of our study. Furthermore,\nwe explore to what extent current mechanisms - legal, technical, and or\nnormative - help mitigate potential risks associated with unwanted bias in\nintelligent systems that make up the mHealth domain. We provide additional\nguidance on the role and responsibilities technologists and policymakers have\nto ensure that such systems empower patients equitably.",

    "abstract": "We define a broader family of corruption processes that generalizes\npreviously known diffusion models. To reverse these general diffusions, we\npropose a new objective called Soft Score Matching that provably learns the\nscore function for any linear corruption process and yields state of the art\nresults for CelebA. Soft Score Matching incorporates the degradation process in\nthe network and trains the model to predict a clean image that after corruption\nmatches the diffused observation. We show that our objective learns the\ngradient of the likelihood under suitable regularity conditions for the family\nof corruption processes. We further develop a principled way to select the\ncorruption levels for general diffusion processes and a novel sampling method\nthat we call Momentum Sampler. We evaluate our framework with the corruption\nbeing Gaussian Blur and low magnitude additive noise. Our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art FID score $1.85$ on CelebA-64, outperforming all previous\nlinear diffusion models. We also show significant computational benefits\ncompared to vanilla denoising diffusion.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method on\nunfitted meshes for single-phase Darcy flow in a fractured porous media. In\nparticular we apply the HDG methodology to the recently introduced\nreinterpreted discrete fracture model (RDFM) [Xu & Yang, 2021 submitted] that\nuse Dirac-$\\delta$ functions to model both conductive and blocking fractures.\nDue to the use of Dirac-$\\delta$ function approach for the fractures, our\nnumerical scheme naturally allows for unfitted meshes with respect to the\nfractures, which is the major novelty of the proposed scheme. Moreover, the\nscheme is locally mass conservative and is relatively easy to implement\ncomparing with existing work on the subject. In particular, our scheme is a\nsimple modification of an existing regular Darcy flow HDG solver by adding the\nfollowing two components: (i) locate the co-dimension one fractures in the\nbackground mesh and adding the appropriate surface integrals associated with\nthese fractures into the stiffness matrix, (ii) adjust the penalty parameters\non cells cut through conductive and blocking fractures (fractured cells).\nDespite the simplicity of the proposed scheme, it performs extremely well for\nvarious benchmark test cases in both two- and three-dimensions. This is the\nfirst time that a truly unfitted finite element scheme been applied to complex\nfractured porous media flow problems in 3D with both blocking and conductive\nfractures without any restrictions on the meshes.",

Existing robustness analyzers\ncan reason about semantic feature neighborhoods to increase the networks'\nreliability.

The key idea is to build on prior\nsteps to predict the next optimal step. The optimal step is predicted by\nestimating the certification velocity and sensitivity via parametric\nregression. We evaluate VeeP on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet and\nshow that it can analyze neighborhoods of various features: brightness,\ncontrast, hue, saturation, and lightness. We show that, on average, given a 90\nminute timeout, VeeP verifies 96% of the maximally certifiable neighborhoods\nwithin 29 minutes, while existing splitting approaches verify, on average, 73%\nof the maximally certifiable neighborhoods within 58 minutes.",

    "abstract": "Streaming string transducers (SSTs) implement string-to-string\ntransformations by reading their input in a single left-to-right pass while\nmaintaining fragments of potential outputs in a finite set of string variables.\nThese variables get updated on transitions of the transducer where they can be\nreassigned to concatenations of variables and symbols. An SST is called\n\\emph{copyless} if every update is such that no variable gets copied to more\nthan once. Copyless SSTs capture Courcelle's monadic second-order definable\ngraph transformations (MSOT) when restricted to string-to-string rewritings.\nThe extension of copyless SSTs with nondeterminism is also known to be\nequivalent to the nondeterministic variant of MSOTs.\nMSOTs, both deterministic and nondeterministic, are closed under composition.\nGiven the equivalence of MSOT and copyless SSTs, it is easy to see that\ncopyless SSTs are also closed under composition. The original proofs of this\nfact, however, were based on a direct construction to produce a composite\ncopyless SST from two given copyless SSTs. A counterexample discovered by Joost\nEnglefriet showed that this construction may produce copyful transducers. We\nrevisit the original composition constructions for both deterministic and\nnondeterministic SSTs and show that, although they can introduce copyful\nupdates, the resulting copyful behavior they exhibit is superficial and is\ncharacterized by a property we call \"diamond-free\": two copies of the variables\nare never merged. To recover a modified version of the original construction,\nwe provide a method for producing an equivalent copyless NSST from any\ndiamond-free copyful NSST.",

The quality of\nsleep is very important in every person lifestyle, removing various diseases.\nBad sleep is a big problem for a lot of people for a very long time. People\nsuffering from various diseases are dealing with various sleeping disorders,\ncommonly known as sleep apnea. Real-time monitoring of sleep is the key to\ndetecting sleep apnea. To solve this problem, an IoT based real-time sleep\napnea monitoring system has been developed.

The system contains various sensors to measure the\nECG, Heart Rate, Pulse rate, Skin response, and SpO2 of any person during the\nentire sleeping period. To analyze and detect sleep apnea in real time, the\nsystem monitors several people during the sleeping period. The results are\ndisplayed on the monitor of the Arduino boards and in the mobile application.\nThe analysis of the achieved data can detect sleep apnea in some of the people\nthat the system monitored, and it can also display the reason why sleep apnea\nhappens.

    "abstract": "Recently introduced transformer-based article encoders (TAEs) designed to\nproduce similar vector representations for mutually related scientific articles\nhave demonstrated strong performance on benchmark datasets for scientific\narticle recommendation. However, the existing benchmark datasets are\npredominantly focused on single domains and, in some cases, contain easy\nnegatives in small candidate pools. Evaluating representations on such\nbenchmarks might obscure the realistic performance of TAEs in setups with\nthousands of articles in candidate pools. In this work, we evaluate TAEs on\nlarge benchmarks with more challenging candidate pools. We compare the\nperformance of TAEs with a lexical retrieval baseline model BM25 on the task of\ncitation recommendation, where the model produces a list of recommendations for\nciting in a given input article. We find out that BM25 is still very\ncompetitive with the state-of-the-art neural retrievers, a finding which is\nsurprising given the strong performance of TAEs on small benchmarks.

    "title": "Towards a Recommender System for Profiling Users in a Renewable  Energetic Community",
    "abstract": "Current Energy systems located in almost all nations are going through a\nradical transformation motivated by technological, environmental and\ninstitutional needs. The introduction of novel technologies for energy\nproduction and storing, the insurgence of climate change and the attention for\nthe introduction of low impact technologies in some countries are main factors\nleading this transformation. Here we focus in particular on the introduction of\nrelatively small community energy systems based on solar energy that aim to\nre-organize local energy systems to integrate distributed energy resources and\nengage local communities. In each community, there is a set of producers and a\nset of consumers (and a set of producers/consumers called prosumers). One of\nthe key aspects of the energetic communities is to maximise the energy that is\nshared within the user. Thus, it is crucial to select the best\nconsumers/prosumers on the basis of their profile of consumption, in order to\nminimize subsequent management of the energy once the community is built. Here\nwe describe the design of a recommender sysstem that is able to profile users\non the basis of their past profile for subsequent admission into the energetic\ncommunity. Experiments supporting this publication have been carried out under\nthe BDTI (Big Data Test Infrastructure) of the European Union.

    "abstract": "Susceptibility tensor imaging (STI) is an emerging magnetic resonance imaging\ntechnique that characterizes the anisotropic tissue magnetic susceptibility\nwith a second-order tensor model. STI has the potential to provide information\nfor both the reconstruction of white matter fiber pathways and detection of\nmyelin changes in the brain at mm resolution or less, which would be of great\nvalue for understanding brain structure and function in healthy and diseased\nbrain. However, the application of STI in vivo has been hindered by its\ncumbersome and time-consuming acquisition requirement of measuring\nsusceptibility induced MR phase changes at multiple (usually more than six)\nhead orientations. This complexity is enhanced by the limitation in head\nrotation angles due to physical constraints of the head coil. As a result, STI\nhas not yet been widely applied in human studies in vivo. In this work, we\ntackle these issues by proposing an image reconstruction algorithm for STI that\nleverages data-driven priors. Our method, called DeepSTI, learns the data prior\nimplicitly via a deep neural network that approximates the proximal operator of\na regularizer function for STI. The dipole inversion problem is then solved\niteratively using the learned proximal network. Experimental results using both\nsimulation and in vivo human data demonstrate great improvement over\nstate-of-the-art algorithms in terms of the reconstructed tensor image,\nprincipal eigenvector maps and tractography results, while allowing for tensor\nreconstruction with MR phase measured at much less than six different\norientations.

    "title": "A New Framework for Quantum Oblivious Transfer",
    "abstract": "We present a new template for building oblivious transfer from quantum\ninformation that we call the \"fixed basis\" framework. Our framework departs\nfrom prior work (eg., Crepeau and Kilian, FOCS '88) by fixing the correct\nchoice of measurement basis used by each player, except for some hidden trap\nqubits that are intentionally measured in a conjugate basis. We instantiate\nthis template in the quantum random oracle model (QROM) to obtain simple\nprotocols that implement, with security against malicious adversaries:\n1. Non-interactive random-input bit OT in a model where parties share EPR\npairs a priori.\n2. Two-round random-input bit OT without setup, obtained by showing that the\nprotocol above remains secure even if the (potentially malicious) OT receiver\nsets up the EPR pairs.\n3. Three-round chosen-input string OT from BB84 states without entanglement\nor setup. This improves upon natural variations of the CK88 template that\nrequire at least five rounds.\nAlong the way, we develop technical tools that may be of independent\ninterest. We prove that natural functions like XOR enable seedless randomness\nextraction from certain quantum sources of entropy. We also use idealized (i.e.\nextractable and equivocal) bit commitments, which we obtain by proving security\nof simple and efficient constructions in the QROM.",

    "abstract": "Traditional black-box optimization methods are inefficient when dealing with\nmulti-point measurement, i.e. when each query in the control domain requires a\nset of measurements in a secondary domain to calculate the objective. In\nparticle accelerators, emittance tuning from quadrupole scans is an example of\noptimization with multi-point measurements. Although the emittance is a\ncritical parameter for the performance of high-brightness machines, including\nX-ray lasers and linear colliders, comprehensive optimization is often limited\nby the time required for tuning. Here, we extend the recently-proposed Bayesian\nAlgorithm Execution (BAX) to the task of optimization with multi-point\nmeasurements. BAX achieves sample-efficiency by selecting and modeling\nindividual points in the joint control-measurement domain. We apply BAX to\nemittance minimization at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) and the\nFacility for Advanced Accelerator Experimental Tests II (FACET-II) particle\naccelerators. In an LCLS simulation environment, we show that BAX delivers a\n20x increase in efficiency while also being more robust to noise compared to\ntraditional optimization methods. Additionally, we ran BAX live at both LCLS\nand FACET-II, matching the hand-tuned emittance at FACET-II and achieving an\noptimal emittance that was 24% lower than that obtained by hand-tuning at LCLS.\nWe anticipate that our approach can readily be adapted to other types of\noptimization problems involving multi-point measurements commonly found in\nscientific instruments.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we aim to investigate Primal-Dual (PD) methods for\nconvex-strongly-concave saddle point problems (SPP). In many cases, the\ncomputation of the proximal oracle over the primal-only function is\ninefficient. Hence, we use its first-order linear approximation in the proximal\nstep resulting in a Linearized PD (LPD) method. Even when the coupling term is\nbilinear, we observe that LPD has a suboptimal dependence on the Lipschitz\nconstant of the primal-only function. In contrast, LPD has optimal convergence\nfor the strongly-convex concave case. This observation induces us to present\nour accelerated linearized primal-dual (ALPD) algorithm to solve convex\nstrongly-concave SPP. ALPD is a single-loop algorithm that combines features of\nNesterov's accelerated gradient descent (AGD) and LPD. We show that when the\ncoupling term is semi-linear (which contains bilinear as a specific case), ALPD\nobtains the optimal dependence on the Lipschitz constant of primal-only\nfunction. Hence, it is an optimal algorithm. When the coupling term has a\ngeneral nonlinear form, the ALPD algorithm has suboptimal dependence on the\nLipschitz constant of the primal part of the coupling term. To improve this\ndependence, we present an inexact APD algorithm. This algorithm performs AGD\niterations in the inner loop to find an approximate solution to a proximal\nsubproblem of APD. We show that inexact APD maintains optimal number of\ngradients evaluations (gradient complexity) of primal-only and dual parts of\nthe problem. It also significantly improves the gradient-complexity of the\nprimal coupling term.",

The dilatation of a bile duct is a key indicator for more major\nproblems in the human body, such as stones and tumors, which are frequently\ncaused by the pancreas or the papilla of vater. The detection of bile duct\ndilatation can be challenging for beginner or untrained medical personnel in\nmany circumstances. Even professionals are unable to detect bile duct\ndilatation with the naked eye. This research presents a unique vision-based\nmodel for biliary tree initial diagnosis. To segment the biliary tree from the\nMagnetic Resonance Image, the framework used different image processing\napproaches (MRI). After the image's region of interest was segmented, numerous\ncalculations were performed on it to extract 10 features, including major and\nminor axes, bile duct area, biliary tree area, compactness, and some textural\nfeatures (contrast, mean, variance and correlation). This study used a database\nof images from King Hussein Medical Center in Amman, Jordan, which included 200\nMRI images, 100 normal cases, and 100 patients with dilated bile ducts. After\nthe characteristics are extracted, various classifiers are used to determine\nthe patients' condition in terms of their health (normal or dilated). The\nfindings demonstrate that the extracted features perform well with all\nclassifiers in terms of accuracy and area under the curve. This study is unique\nin that it uses an automated approach to segment the biliary tree from MRI\nimages, as well as scientifically correlating retrieved features with biliary\ntree status that has never been done before in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Evaluating the efficiency of organizations and branches within an\norganization is a challenging issue for managers. Evaluation criteria allow\norganizations to rank their internal units, identify their position concerning\ntheir competitors, and implement strategies for improvement and development\npurposes. Among the methods that have been applied in the evaluation of bank\nbranches, non-parametric methods have captured the attention of researchers in\nrecent years. One of the most widely used non-parametric methods is the data\nenvelopment analysis (DEA) which leads to promising results. However, the\nstatic DEA approaches do not consider the time in the model. Therefore, this\npaper uses a dynamic DEA (DDEA) method to evaluate the branches of a private\nIranian bank over three years (2017-2019). The results are then compared with\nstatic DEA. After ranking the branches, they are clustered using the K-means\nmethod. Finally, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis approach is introduced to\nhelp the managers to decide about changing variables to shift a branch from one\ncluster to a more efficient one.",

    "abstract": "Finding a Maximum Clique is a classic property test from graph theory; find\nany one of the largest complete subgraphs in an Erd{\\\"o}s-R{\\'e}nyi $G(N,p)$\nrandom graph. It is the simplest of many such problems in which algorithms\nrequiring only a small power of $N$ steps cannot reach solutions which\nprobabilistic arguments show must exist, exposing an inherently \"hard\" phase\nwithin the solution space of the problem. Such \"hard\" phases are seen in many\nNP-Complete problems, in the limit when $N \\to \\infty$. But optimization\nproblems arise and must be solved at finite N. We use this simplest case,\nMaxClique, to explore the structure of the problem as a function of $N$ and\n$K$, the clique size. It displays a complex phase boundary, a staircase of\nsteps at each of which $2 \\log_2N$ and $K_{\\text{max}}$, the maximum size of\nclique that can be found, increase by $1$. Each of its boundaries have finite\nwidth, and these widths allow local algorithms to find cliques beyond the\nlimits defined by the study of infinite systems. We explore the performance of\na number of extensions of traditional fast local algorithms, and find that much\nof the \"hard\" space remains accessible at finite $N$.\nThe \"hidden clique\" problem embeds a clique somewhat larger than those which\noccur naturally in a $G(N,p)$ random graph.

    "abstract": "Lossless and near-lossless image compression is of paramount importance to\nprofessional users in many technical fields, such as medicine, remote sensing,\nprecision engineering and scientific research. But despite rapidly growing\nresearch interests in learning-based image compression, no published method\noffers both lossless and near-lossless modes. In this paper, we propose a\nunified and powerful deep lossy plus residual (DLPR) coding framework for both\nlossless and near-lossless image compression. In the lossless mode, the DLPR\ncoding system first performs lossy compression and then lossless coding of\nresiduals. We solve the joint lossy and residual compression problem in the\napproach of VAEs, and add autoregressive context modeling of the residuals to\nenhance lossless compression performance. In the near-lossless mode, we\nquantize the original residuals to satisfy a given $\\ell_\\infty$ error bound,\nand propose a scalable near-lossless compression scheme that works for variable\n$\\ell_\\infty$ bounds instead of training multiple networks. To expedite the\nDLPR coding, we increase the degree of algorithm parallelization by a novel\ndesign of coding context, and accelerate the entropy coding with adaptive\nresidual interval. Experimental results demonstrate that the DLPR coding system\nachieves both the state-of-the-art lossless and near-lossless image compression\nperformance with competitive coding speed.",

We demonstrate\nML-DSC in the general LQG problem. Because estimation and control are not\nclearly separated in the general LQG problem, the Riccati equation is modified\nto the decentralized Riccati equation, which improves estimation as well as\ncontrol. Our numerical experiment shows that the decentralized Riccati equation\nis superior to the conventional Riccati equation.",

    "abstract": "The escalating gas-supply crisis in the EU calls for immediate political and\nregulatory actions to improve the energy security.

In this paper we aim to formalize a simple game-theoretic\nmodel in order to capture the basic features of the problem, considering the\nrelated uncertainty of the future conditions related to reservoir levels and\npossible transmission bottlenecks as well. We propose a mechanism for\nsupply-security related cooperation, which is based on voluntary participation,\nand may contribute to the more efficient utilization of storage capacities if\nits principles may be later implemented.

    "abstract": "We study the practical setting in which regular- and reserve-crew schedules\nare dynamically maintained up to the day of executing the schedule. At each day\npreceding the execution of the schedule, disruptions occur due to sudden\nunavailability of personnel, making the planned regular and reserve-crew\nschedules infeasible for its execution day. This paper studies the fundamental\nquestion how to repair the schedules' infeasibility in the days preceding the\nexecution, taking into account labor regulations. We propose a robust repair\nstrategy that maintains flexibility in order to cope with additional future\ndisruptions. The flexibility in reserve-crew usage is explicitly considered\nthrough evaluating the expected shortfall of the reserve-crew schedule based on\na Markov chain formulation. The core of our approach relies on iteratively\nsolving a set-covering formulation, which we call the Robust Crew Recovery\nProblem, which encapsulates this flexibility notion for reserve crew usage. A\ntailored branch-and-price algorithm is developed for solving the Robust Crew\nRecovery Problem to optimality. The corresponding pricing problem is\nefficiently solved by a newly developed pulse algorithm. Based on actual data\nfrom a medium-sized hub-and-spoke airline, we show that embracing our approach\nleads to fewer flight cancellations and fewer last-minute alterations, compared\nto repairing disrupted schedules without considering our robust measure.",

The required background and a method of\ncomputing persistent homology is briefly discussed in this work.

A method will also be proposed, that uses topological\ndata analysis to determine the optimal delay for a time-delay embedding. TDA\nwill also be applied to a Z24 Bridge case study in structural health\nmonitoring, where it will be used to scrutinise different data partitions,\nclassified by the conditions at which the data were collected.

This work describes a fully 3D\nprototypical few-shot segmentation algorithm, such that the trained networks\ncan be effectively adapted to clinically interesting structures that are absent\nin training, using only a few labelled images from a different institute.\nFirst, to compensate for the widely recognised spatial variability between\ninstitutions in episodic adaptation of novel classes, a novel spatial\nregistration mechanism is integrated into prototypical learning, consisting of\na segmentation head and an spatial alignment module. Second, to assist the\ntraining with observed imperfect alignment, support mask conditioning module is\nproposed to further utilise the annotation available from the support images.\nExtensive experiments are presented in an application of segmenting eight\nanatomical structures important for interventional planning, using a data set\nof 589 pelvic T2-weighted MR images, acquired at seven institutes.

Economic policy\nuncertainty is defined as the public's inability to predict the outcomes of\ntheir decisions under new policies and future economic fundamentals.\nQuantifying EPU is of great importance to policy makers, economists, and\ninvestors since it influences their expectations about the future economic\nfundamentals with an impact on their policy, investment and saving decisions.\nMost of the previous work using news articles for measuring EPU are either\nmanual or based on a simple keyword search.

Weak supervision is shown to be an\nefficient machine learning paradigm for applying machine learning models in low\nresource settings with no or scarce training sets, leveraging domain knowledge\nand heuristics.

We show that there is a\nnon-abelian $\\text{PSL}(2, \\mathbb{F})$ quotient where $|\\mathbb F| <\nc(2^{20t}3^{120t})$ for an absolute constant $c>0$ and use this to show that\nthe lens space recognition problem lies in coNP for Seifert fiber space input.\nWe end with a discussion of our results in the context of distinguishing lens\nspaces from other $3$--manifolds more generally.",
