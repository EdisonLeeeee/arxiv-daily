    "abstract": "In recommendation systems, items are likely to be exposed to various users\nand we would like to learn about the familiarity of a new user with an existing\nitem. This can be formulated as an anomaly detection (AD) problem\ndistinguishing between \"common users\" (nominal) and \"fresh users\" (anomalous).\nConsidering the sheer volume of items and the sparsity of user-item paired\ndata, independently applying conventional single-task detection methods on each\nitem quickly becomes difficult, while correlations between items are ignored.\nTo address this multi-task anomaly detection problem, we propose collaborative\nanomaly detection (CAD) to jointly learn all tasks with an embedding encoding\ncorrelations among tasks. We explore CAD with conditional density estimation\nand conditional likelihood ratio estimation. We found that: $i$) estimating a\nlikelihood ratio enjoys more efficient learning and yields better results than\ndensity estimation. $ii$) It is beneficial to select a small number of tasks in\nadvance to learn a task embedding model, and then use it to warm-start all task\nembeddings. Consequently, these embeddings can capture correlations between\ntasks and generalize to new correlated tasks.",

They have successfully proven\nthemselves in expeditions, gas industry, mines, warehouses, etc. However, even\nlegged robots may stuck in rough terrain conditions requiring human cognitive\nabilities to navigate the system. While gamepads and keyboards are convenient\nfor wheeled robot control, the quadruped robot in 3D space can move along all\nlinear coordinates and Euler angles, requiring at least 12 buttons for\nindependent control of their DoF. Therefore, more convenient interfaces of\ncontrol are required.\nIn this paper we present HyperPalm: a novel gesture interface for intuitive\nhuman-robot interaction with quadruped robots. Without additional devices, the\noperator has full position and orientation control of the quadruped robot in 3D\nspace through hand gesture recognition with only 5 gestures and 6 DoF hand\nmotion.\nThe experimental results revealed to classify 5 static gestures with high\naccuracy (96.5%), accurately predict the position of the 6D position of the\nhand in three-dimensional space. The absolute linear deviation Root mean square\ndeviation (RMSD) of the proposed approach is 11.7 mm, which is almost 50% lower\nthan for the second tested approach, the absolute angular deviation RMSD of the\nproposed approach is 2.6 degrees, which is almost 27% lower than for the second\ntested approach. Moreover, the user study was conducted to explore user's\nsubjective experience from human-robot interaction through the proposed gesture\ninterface. The participants evaluated their interaction with HyperPalm as\nintuitive (2.0), not causing frustration (2.63), and requiring low physical\ndemand (2.0).",

Specifically, a discrepant bi-regressor\narchitecture is developed to maximize the difference of bi-regressor to\ndiscover uncertain target instances far from the source distribution, and then\nan adversarial training mechanism is adopted between feature extractor and dual\nregressors to produce domain-invariant representations. To further bridge the\nlarge domain gap, a domain-specific augmentation module is designed to\nsynthesize two source-similar and target-similar intermediate domains to\ngradually eliminate the original domain mismatch.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we demonstrate and investigate several challenges that stand\nin the way of tackling complex problems using physics-informed neural networks.\nIn particular, we visualize the loss landscapes of trained models and perform\nsensitivity analysis of backpropagated gradients in the presence of physics.\nOur findings suggest that existing methods produce highly non-convex loss\nlandscapes that are difficult to navigate. Furthermore, high-order PDEs\ncontaminate the backpropagated gradients that may impede or prevent\nconvergence. We then propose a novel method that bypasses the calculation of\nhigh-order PDE operators and mitigates the contamination of backpropagating\ngradients. In doing so, we reduce the dimension of the search space of our\nsolution and facilitate learning problems with non-smooth solutions. Our\nformulation also provides a feedback mechanism that helps our model adaptively\nfocus on complex regions of the domain that are difficult to learn. We then\nformulate an unconstrained dual problem by adapting the Lagrange multiplier\nmethod. We apply our method to solve several challenging benchmark problems\ngoverned by linear and non-linear PDEs.",

    "abstract": "Crop management, including nitrogen (N) fertilization and irrigation\nmanagement, has a significant impact on the crop yield, economic profit, and\nthe environment. Although management guidelines exist, it is challenging to\nfind the optimal management practices given a specific planting environment and\na crop. Previous work used reinforcement learning (RL) and crop simulators to\nsolve the problem, but the trained policies either have limited performance or\nare not deployable in the real world. In this paper, we present an intelligent\ncrop management system which optimizes the N fertilization and irrigation\nsimultaneously via RL, imitation learning (IL), and crop simulations using the\nDecision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT). We first use deep\nRL, in particular, deep Q-network, to train management policies that require\nall state information from the simulator as observations (denoted as full\nobservation). We then invoke IL to train management policies that only need a\nlimited amount of state information that can be readily obtained in the real\nworld (denoted as partial observation) by mimicking the actions of the\npreviously RL-trained policies under full observation. We conduct experiments\non a case study using maize in Florida and compare trained policies with a\nmaize management guideline in simulations. Our trained policies under both full\nand partial observations achieve better outcomes, resulting in a higher profit\nor a similar profit with a smaller environmental impact. Moreover, the\npartial-observation management policies are directly deployable in the real\nworld as they use readily available information.",

    "abstract": "Performing neural network inference on encrypted data without decryption is\none popular method to enable privacy-preserving neural networks (PNet) as a\nservice. Compared with regular neural networks deployed for\nmachine-learning-as-a-service, PNet requires additional encoding, e.g.,\nquantized-precision numbers, and polynomial activation. Encrypted input also\nintroduces novel challenges such as adversarial robustness and security. To the\nbest of our knowledge, we are the first to study questions including (i)\nWhether PNet is more robust against adversarial inputs than regular neural\nnetworks? (ii) How to design a robust PNet given the encrypted input without\ndecryption? We propose PNet-Attack to generate black-box adversarial examples\nthat can successfully attack PNet in both target and untarget manners. The\nattack results show that PNet robustness against adversarial inputs needs to be\nimproved. This is not a trivial task because the PNet model owner does not have\naccess to the plaintext of the input values, which prevents the application of\nexisting detection and defense methods such as input tuning, model\nnormalization, and adversarial training. To tackle this challenge, we propose a\nnew fast and accurate noise insertion method, called RPNet, to design Robust\nand Private Neural Networks. Our comprehensive experiments show that\nPNet-Attack reduces at least $2.5\\times$ queries than prior works. We\ntheoretically analyze our RPNet methods and demonstrate that RPNet can decrease\n$\\sim 91.88\\%$ attack success rate.",

To achieve this,\nand in contrast to traditional cellular networks, Magma adopts an approach that\nextensively leverages Internet design patterns, terminating access\nnetwork-specific protocols at the edge and abstracting the access network from\nthe core architecture.

Specifically we\nstudy experiments with AZNN for time-varying square matrix factorizations as a\nproduct of time-varying symmetric matrices and for the time-varying matrix\nsquare roots problem. Differing from generally used small $\\eta$ values and\nminimal start-up length phases in ZNN, we adapt the basic ZNN method to work\nwith large or even gigantic $\\eta$ settings and arbitrary length start-ups\nusing Euler's low accuracy finite difference formula. These adaptations improve\nthe speed of AZNN's convergence and lower its solution error bounds for our\nchosen problems significantly to near machine constant or even lower levels.\nParameter-varying AZNN also allows us to find full rank symmetrizers of\nstatic matrices reliably, for example for the Kahan and Frank matrices and for\nmatrices with highly ill-conditioned eigenvalues and complicated Jordan\nstructures of dimensions from $n = 2$ on up. This helps in cases where full\nrank static matrix symmetrizers have never been successfully computed before.",

    "abstract": "The state-of-the-art multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods have\nprovided promising solutions to a variety of complex problems. Yet, these\nmethods all assume that agents perform synchronized primitive-action executions\nso that they are not genuinely scalable to long-horizon real-world\nmulti-agent/robot tasks that inherently require agents/robots to asynchronously\nreason about high-level action selection at varying time durations. The\nMacro-Action Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process\n(MacDec-POMDP) is a general formalization for asynchronous decision-making\nunder uncertainty in fully cooperative multi-agent tasks. In this thesis, we\nfirst propose a group of value-based RL approaches for MacDec-POMDPs, where\nagents are allowed to perform asynchronous learning and decision-making with\nmacro-action-value functions in three paradigms: decentralized learning and\ncontrol, centralized learning and control, and centralized training for\ndecentralized execution (CTDE). Building on the above work, we formulate a set\nof macro-action-based policy gradient algorithms under the three training\nparadigms, where agents are allowed to directly optimize their parameterized\npolicies in an asynchronous manner. We evaluate our methods both in simulation\nand on real robots over a variety of realistic domains. Empirical results\ndemonstrate the superiority of our approaches in large multi-agent problems and\nvalidate the effectiveness of our algorithms for learning high-quality and\nasynchronous solutions with macro-actions.",

    "abstract": "Growing free online 3D shapes collections dictated research on 3D retrieval.\nActive debate has however been had on (i) what the best input modality is to\ntrigger retrieval, and (ii) the ultimate usage scenario for such retrieval. In\nthis paper, we offer a different perspective towards answering these questions\n-- we study the use of 3D sketches as an input modality and advocate a\nVR-scenario where retrieval is conducted. Thus, the ultimate vision is that\nusers can freely retrieve a 3D model by air-doodling in a VR environment. As a\nfirst stab at this new 3D VR-sketch to 3D shape retrieval problem, we make four\ncontributions. First, we code a VR utility to collect 3D VR-sketches and\nconduct retrieval. Second, we collect the first set of $167$ 3D VR-sketches on\ntwo shape categories from ModelNet. Third, we propose a novel approach to\ngenerate a synthetic dataset of human-like 3D sketches of different abstract\nlevels to train deep networks. At last, we compare the common multi-view and\nvolumetric approaches: We show that, in contrast to 3D shape to 3D shape\nretrieval, volumetric point-based approaches exhibit superior performance on 3D\nsketch to 3D shape retrieval due to the sparse and abstract nature of 3D\nVR-sketches. We believe these contributions will collectively serve as enablers\nfor future attempts at this problem. The VR interface, code and datasets are\navailable at https://tinyurl.com/3DSketch3DV.",

Such maneuverability requires an\nomnidirectional multirotor to frequently alter the thrust amplitude and even\ndirection, which is prone to the rotors' settling time induced from the rotors'\nown dynamics. Furthermore, the omnidirectional multirotor's stability for\ntracking control in the presence of rotor dynamics has not yet been addressed.\nTo resolve this issue, we propose a geometric tracking controller that takes\nthe rotor dynamics into account.

While the framework can be applied\nto the general dexterous manipulation, we focus on a more complex definition of\nin-hand manipulation, where at the goal pose the hand has to reach a grasp\nsuitable for using the object as a tool. The high level planner determines the\nobject trajectory as well as the grasp changes, i.e. adding, removing, or\nsliding fingers, to be executed by the low-level controller. While the grasp\nsequence is planned online by a learning-based policy to adapt to variations,\nthe trajectory planner and the low-level controller for object tracking and\ncontact force control are exclusively model-based to robustly realize the plan.\nBy infusing the knowledge about the physics of the problem and the low-level\ncontroller into the grasp planner, it learns to successfully generate grasps\nsimilar to those generated by model-based optimization approaches, obviating\nthe high computation cost of online running of such methods to account for\nvariations. By performing experiments in physics simulation for realistic tool\nuse scenarios, we show the success of our method on different tool-use tasks\nand dexterous hand models.

    "abstract": "Automated summarization of clinical texts can reduce the burden of medical\nprofessionals. \"Discharge summaries\" are one promising application of the\nsummarization, because they can be generated from daily inpatient records. Our\npreliminary experiment suggests that 20-31% of the descriptions in discharge\nsummaries overlap with the content of the inpatient records. However, it\nremains unclear how the summaries should be generated from the unstructured\nsource. To decompose the physician's summarization process, this study aimed to\nidentify the optimal granularity in summarization. We first defined three types\nof summarization units with different granularities to compare the performance\nof the discharge summary generation: whole sentences, clinical segments, and\nclauses. We defined clinical segments in this study, aiming to express the\nsmallest medically meaningful concepts. To obtain the clinical segments, it was\nnecessary to automatically split the texts in the first stage of the pipeline.\nAccordingly, we compared rule-based methods and a machine learning method, and\nthe latter outperformed the formers with an F1 score of 0.846 in the splitting\ntask. Next, we experimentally measured the accuracy of extractive summarization\nusing the three types of units, based on the ROUGE-1 metric, on a\nmulti-institutional national archive of health records in Japan. The measured\naccuracies of extractive summarization using whole sentences, clinical\nsegments, and clauses were 31.91, 36.15, and 25.18, respectively. We found that\nthe clinical segments yielded higher accuracy than sentences and clauses. This\nresult indicates that summarization of inpatient records demands finer\ngranularity than sentence-oriented processing.

A standard scheme in external clustering validation\nis to use class labels as ground truth clusters, based on the assumption that\neach class forms a single, clearly separated cluster. However, as such\ncluster-label matching (CLM) assumption often breaks, the lack of conducting a\nsanity check for the CLM of benchmark datasets casts doubt on the validity of\nexternal validations. Still, evaluating the degree of CLM is challenging. For\nexample, internal clustering validation measures can be used to quantify CLM\nwithin the same dataset to evaluate its different clusterings but are not\ndesigned to compare clusterings of different datasets. In this work, we propose\na principled way to generate between-dataset internal measures that enable the\ncomparison of CLM across datasets. We first determine four axioms for\nbetween-dataset internal measures, complementing Ackerman and Ben-David's\nwithin-dataset axioms. We then propose processes to generalize internal\nmeasures to fulfill these new axioms, and use them to extend the widely used\nCalinski-Harabasz index for between-dataset CLM evaluation. Through\nquantitative experiments, we (1) verify the validity and necessity of the\ngeneralization processes and (2) show that the proposed between-dataset\nCalinski-Harabasz index accurately evaluates CLM across datasets.

    "title": "Mutual Information Learned Classifiers: an Information-theoretic  Viewpoint of Training Deep Learning Classification Systems",
    "abstract": "Deep learning systems have been reported to achieve state-of-the-art\nperformances in many applications, and a key is the existence of well trained\nclassifiers on benchmark datasets. As a main-stream loss function, the cross\nentropy can easily lead us to find models which demonstrate severe overfitting\nbehavior. In this paper, we show that the existing cross entropy loss\nminimization problem essentially learns the label conditional entropy (CE) of\nthe underlying data distribution of the dataset. However, the CE learned in\nthis way does not characterize well the information shared by the label and the\ninput. In this paper, we propose a mutual information learning framework where\nwe train deep neural network classifiers via learning the mutual information\nbetween the label and the input. Theoretically, we give the population\nclassification error lower bound in terms of the mutual information. In\naddition, we derive the mutual information lower and upper bounds for a\nconcrete binary classification data model in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, and also the error\nprobability lower bound in this scenario. Empirically, we conduct extensive\nexperiments on several benchmark datasets to support our theory. The mutual\ninformation learned classifiers (MILCs) achieve far better generalization\nperformances than the conditional entropy learned classifiers (CELCs) with an\nimprovement which can exceed more than 10\\% in testing accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Many software bugs are reported manually, particularly bugs that manifest\nthemselves visually in the user interface. End-users typically report these\nbugs via app reviewing websites, issue trackers, or in-app built-in bug\nreporting tools, if available. While these systems have various features that\nfacilitate bug reporting (e.g., textual templates or forms), they often provide\nlimited guidance, concrete feedback, or quality verification to end-users, who\nare often inexperienced at reporting bugs and submit low-quality bug reports\nthat lead to excessive developer effort in bug report management tasks. We\npropose an interactive bug reporting system for end-users (Burt), implemented\nas a task-oriented chatbot. Unlike existing bug reporting systems, Burt\nprovides guided reporting of essential bug report elements (i.e., the observed\nbehavior, expected behavior, and steps to reproduce the bug), instant quality\nverification, and graphical suggestions for these elements. We implemented a\nversion of Burt for Android and conducted an empirical evaluation study with\nend-users, who reported 12 bugs from six Android apps studied in prior work.\nThe reporters found that Burt's guidance and automated\nsuggestions/clarifications are useful and Burt is easy to use. We found that\nBurt reports contain higher-quality information than reports collected via a\ntemplate-based bug reporting system. Improvements to Burt, informed by the\nreporters, include support for various wordings to describe bug report elements\nand improved quality verification.

A common\napproach for knowledge-intensive tasks is to employ a retrieve-then-read\npipeline that first retrieves a handful of relevant contextual documents from\nan external corpus such as Wikipedia and then predicts an answer conditioned on\nthe retrieved documents. In this paper, we present a novel perspective for\nsolving knowledge-intensive tasks by replacing document retrievers with large\nlanguage model generators. We call our method generate-then-read (GenRead),\nwhich first prompts a large language model to generate contextutal documents\nbased on a given question, and then reads the generated documents to produce\nthe final answer. Furthermore, we propose a novel clustering-based prompting\nmethod that selects distinct prompts, resulting in the generated documents that\ncover different perspectives, leading to better recall over acceptable answers.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on three different knowledge-intensive tasks,\nincluding open-domain QA, fact checking, and dialogue system.

    "abstract": "The forecasting of credit default risk has been an active research field for\nseveral decades. Historically, logistic regression has been used as a major\ntool due to its compliance with regulatory requirements: transparency,\nexplainability, and fairness. In recent years, researchers have increasingly\nused complex and advanced machine learning methods to improve prediction\naccuracy. Even though a machine learning method could potentially improve the\nmodel accuracy, it complicates simple logistic regression, deteriorates\nexplainability, and often violates fairness. In the absence of compliance with\nregulatory requirements, even highly accurate machine learning methods are\nunlikely to be accepted by companies for credit scoring. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel class of monotonic neural additive models, which meet\nregulatory requirements by simplifying neural network architecture and\nenforcing monotonicity. By utilizing the special architectural features of the\nneural additive model, the monotonic neural additive model penalizes\nmonotonicity violations effectively. Consequently, the computational cost of\ntraining a monotonic neural additive model is similar to that of training a\nneural additive model, as a free lunch. We demonstrate through empirical\nresults that our new model is as accurate as black-box fully-connected neural\nnetworks, providing a highly accurate and regulated machine learning method.",

Although achieving promising performance, deep\nlearning-based inpainting algorithms still struggle from the distortion caused\nby the fusion of structural and contextual features, which are commonly\nobtained from, respectively, deep and shallow layers of a convolutional\nencoder. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel progressive\ninpainting network that maintains the structural and contextual integrity of a\nprocessed image. More specifically, inspired by the Gaussian and Laplacian\npyramids, the core of the proposed network is a feature extraction module named\nGLE. Stacking GLE modules enables the network to extract image features from\ndifferent image frequency components. This ability is important to maintain\nstructural and contextual integrity, for high frequency components correspond\nto structural information while low frequency components correspond to\ncontextual information. The proposed network utilizes the GLE features to\nprogressively fill in missing regions in a corrupted image in an iterative\nmanner.

    "abstract": "Automatic pavement distress classification facilitates improving the\nefficiency of pavement maintenance and reducing the cost of labor and\nresources. A recently influential branch of this task divides the pavement\nimage into patches and addresses these issues from the perspective of\nmulti-instance learning. However, these methods neglect the correlation between\npatches and suffer from a low efficiency in the model optimization and\ninference. Meanwhile, Swin Transformer is able to address both of these issues\nwith its unique strengths. Built upon Swin Transformer, we present a vision\nTransformer named \\textbf{P}avement \\textbf{I}mage \\textbf{C}lassification\n\\textbf{T}ransformer (\\textbf{PicT}) for pavement distress classification. In\norder to better exploit the discriminative information of pavement images at\nthe patch level, the \\textit{Patch Labeling Teacher} is proposed to leverage a\nteacher model to dynamically generate pseudo labels of patches from image\nlabels during each iteration, and guides the model to learn the discriminative\nfeatures of patches. The broad classification head of Swin Transformer may\ndilute the discriminative features of distressed patches in the feature\naggregation step due to the small distressed area ratio of the pavement image.\nTo overcome this drawback, we present a \\textit{Patch Refiner} to cluster\npatches into different groups and only select the highest distress-risk group\nto yield a slim head for the final image classification.

    "abstract": "In many classification models, data is discretized to better estimate its\ndistribution. Existing discretization methods often target at maximizing the\ndiscriminant power of discretized data, while overlooking the fact that the\nprimary target of data discretization in classification is to improve the\ngeneralization performance. As a result, the data tend to be over-split into\nmany small bins since the data without discretization retain the maximal\ndiscriminant information. Thus, we propose a Max-Dependency-Min-Divergence\n(MDmD) criterion that maximizes both the discriminant information and\ngeneralization ability of the discretized data. More specifically, the\nMax-Dependency criterion maximizes the statistical dependency between the\ndiscretized data and the classification variable while the Min-Divergence\ncriterion explicitly minimizes the JS-divergence between the training data and\nthe validation data for a given discretization scheme. The proposed MDmD\ncriterion is technically appealing, but it is difficult to reliably estimate\nthe high-order joint distributions of attributes and the classification\nvariable. We hence further propose a more practical solution,\nMax-Relevance-Min-Divergence (MRmD) discretization scheme, where each attribute\nis discretized separately, by simultaneously maximizing the discriminant\ninformation and the generalization ability of the discretized data. The\nproposed MRmD is compared with the state-of-the-art discretization algorithms\nunder the naive Bayes classification framework on 45 machine-learning benchmark\ndatasets.

    "abstract": "Communication networks such as emails or social networks are now ubiquitous\nand their analysis has become a strategic field. In many applications, the goal\nis to automatically extract relevant information by looking at the nodes and\ntheir connections. Unfortunately, most of the existing methods focus on\nanalysing the presence or absence of edges and textual data is often discarded.\nHowever, all communication networks actually come with textual data on the\nedges. In order to take into account this specificity, we consider in this\npaper networks for which two nodes are linked if and only if they share textual\ndata. We introduce a deep latent variable model allowing embedded topics to be\nhandled called ETSBM to simultaneously perform clustering on the nodes while\nmodelling the topics used between the different clusters. ETSBM extends both\nthe stochastic block model (SBM) and the embedded topic model (ETM) which are\ncore models for studying networks and corpora, respectively. The inference is\ndone using a variational-Bayes expectation-maximisation algorithm combined with\na stochastic gradient descent. The methodology is evaluated on synthetic data\nand on a real world dataset.",

    "abstract": "Optical computing is an emerging technology for next-generation efficient\nartificial intelligence (AI) due to its ultra-high speed and efficiency.\nElectromagnetic field simulation is critical to the design, optimization, and\nvalidation of photonic devices and circuits. However, costly numerical\nsimulation significantly hinders the scalability and turn-around time in the\nphotonic circuit design loop. Recently, physics-informed neural networks have\nbeen proposed to predict the optical field solution of a single instance of a\npartial differential equation (PDE) with predefined parameters. Their\ncomplicated PDE formulation and lack of efficient parametrization mechanisms\nlimit their flexibility and generalization in practical simulation scenarios.\nIn this work, for the first time, a physics-agnostic neural operator-based\nframework, dubbed NeurOLight, is proposed to learn a family of frequency-domain\nMaxwell PDEs for ultra-fast parametric photonic device simulation. We balance\nthe efficiency and generalization of NeurOLight via several novel techniques.\nSpecifically, we discretize different devices into a unified domain, represent\nparametric PDEs with a compact wave prior, and encode the incident light via\nmasked source modeling. We design our model with parameter-efficient\ncross-shaped NeurOLight blocks and adopt superposition-based augmentation for\ndata-efficient learning. With these synergistic approaches, NeurOLight\ngeneralizes to a large space of unseen simulation settings, demonstrates\n2-orders-of-magnitude faster simulation speed than numerical solvers, and\noutperforms prior neural network models by ~54% lower prediction error with\n~44% fewer parameters.

A typical application of LP is\nto retrieve the top scoring neighbors for a given source node, such as the\nfriend recommendation. These services desire the high inference scalability to\nfind the top scoring neighbors from many candidate nodes at low latencies.\nThere are two popular decoders that the recent LP models mainly use to compute\nthe edge scores from node embeddings: the \\textbf{HadamardMLP} and \\textbf{Dot\nProduct} decoders. After theoretical and empirical analysis, we find that the\nHadamardMLP decoders are generally more effective for LP. However, HadamardMLP\nlacks the scalability for retrieving top scoring neighbors on large graphs,\nsince to the best of our knowledge, there does not exist an algorithm to\nretrieve the top scoring neighbors for HadamardMLP decoders in sublinear\ncomplexity. To make HadamardMLP scalable, we propose the \\textit{Flashlight}\nalgorithm to accelerate the top scoring neighbor retrievals for HadamardMLP: a\nsublinear algorithm that progressively applies approximate maximum inner\nproduct search (MIPS) techniques with adaptively adjusted query embeddings.\nEmpirical results show that Flashlight improves the inference speed of LP by\nmore than 100 times on the large OGBL-CITATION2 dataset without sacrificing\neffectiveness.

    "abstract": "Regret has been widely adopted as the metric of choice for evaluating the\nperformance of online optimization algorithms for distributed, multi-agent\nsystems. However, data/model variations associated with agents can\nsignificantly impact decisions and requires consensus among agents. Moreover,\nmost existing works have focused on developing approaches for (either strongly\nor non-strongly) convex losses, and very few results have been obtained\nregarding regret bounds in distributed online optimization for general\nnon-convex losses. To address these two issues, we propose a novel composite\nregret with a new network regret-based metric to evaluate distributed online\noptimization algorithms. We concretely define static and dynamic forms of the\ncomposite regret. By leveraging the dynamic form of our composite regret, we\ndevelop a consensus-based online normalized gradient (CONGD) approach for\npseudo-convex losses, and it provably shows a sublinear behavior relating to a\nregularity term for the path variation of the optimizer. For general non-convex\nlosses, we first shed light on the regret for the setting of distributed online\nnon-convex learning based on recent advances such that no deterministic\nalgorithm can achieve the sublinear regret. We then develop the distributed\nonline non-convex optimization with composite regret (DINOCO) without access to\nthe gradients, depending on an offline optimization oracle. DINOCO is shown to\nachieve sublinear regret; to our knowledge, this is the first regret bound for\ngeneral distributed online non-convex learning.",

We carried out extensive experiments using\nthree popular training strategies: Bert-style joint pretraining + successive\nfinetuning, GPT-style joint pretraining + successive finetuning, and GPT-style\njoint pretraining + joint finetuning.

This project\napplies the observer design technique to detect leaks in natural gas pipelines\nusing a regressoclassification hierarchical model where an intelligent model\nacts as a regressor and a modified logistic regression model acts as a\nclassifier. Five intelligent models (gradient boosting, decision trees, random\nforest, support vector machine and artificial neural network) are studied in\nthis project using a pipeline data stream of four weeks. The results shows that\nwhile support vector machine and artificial neural networks are better\nregressors than the others, they do not provide the best results in leak\ndetection due to their internal complexities and the volume of data used. The\nrandom forest and decision tree models are the most sensitive as they can\ndetect a leak of 0.1% of nominal flow in about 2 hours. All the intelligent\nmodels had high reliability with zero false alarm rate in testing phase. The\naverage time to leak detection for all the intelligent models was compared to a\nreal time transient model in literature.

In this work we\nexplore the use of MDETR in a new task, action detection, without any previous\ntraining. We obtain quantitative results using the Atomic Visual Actions\ndataset. Although the model does not report the best performance in the task,\nwe believe that it is an interesting finding. We show that it is possible to\nuse a multi-modal model to tackle a task that it was not designed for. Finally,\nwe believe that this line of research may lead into the generalization of MDETR\nin additional downstream tasks.",

    "abstract": "Various methods are nowadays available to design observers for broad classes\nof systems. Nevertheless, the question of the tuning of the observer to achieve\nsatisfactory estimation performance remains largely open. This paper presents a\ngeneral supervisory design framework for online tuning of the observer gains\nwith the aim of achieving various trade-offs between robustness and speed of\nconvergence. We assume that a robust nominal observer has been designed for a\ngeneral nonlinear system and the goal is to improve its performance. We present\nfor this purpose a novel hybrid multi-observer, which consists of the nominal\none and a bank of additional observer-like systems, that are collectively\nreferred to as modes and that differ from the nominal observer only in their\noutput injection gains. We then evaluate on-line the estimation cost of each\nmode of the multi-observer and, based on these costs, we select one of them at\neach time instant. Two different strategies are proposed. In the first one,\ninitial conditions of the modes are reset each time the algorithm switches\nbetween different modes. In the second one, the initial conditions are not\nreset. We prove a convergence property for the hybrid estimation scheme and we\nillustrate the efficiency of the approach in improving the performance of a\ngiven nominal high-gain observer on a numerical example.",

    "abstract": "This paper tackles recipe generation from unsegmented cooking videos, a task\nthat requires agents to (1) extract key events in completing the dish and (2)\ngenerate sentences for the extracted events. Our task is similar to dense video\ncaptioning (DVC), which aims at detecting events thoroughly and generating\nsentences for them. However, unlike DVC, in recipe generation, recipe story\nawareness is crucial, and a model should output an appropriate number of key\nevents in the correct order. We analyze the output of the DVC model and observe\nthat although (1) several events are adoptable as a recipe story, (2) the\ngenerated sentences for such events are not grounded in the visual content.\nBased on this, we hypothesize that we can obtain correct recipes by selecting\noracle events from the output events of the DVC model and re-generating\nsentences for them. To achieve this, we propose a novel transformer-based joint\napproach of training event selector and sentence generator for selecting oracle\nevents from the outputs of the DVC model and generating grounded sentences for\nthe events, respectively. In addition, we extend the model by including\ningredients to generate more accurate recipes. The experimental results show\nthat the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art DVC models. We also\nconfirm that, by modeling the recipe in a story-aware manner, the proposed\nmodel output the appropriate number of events in the correct order.",

Policymakers, practitioners and researchers have\ninvested in both measuring impacts and developing interventions to reduce\nburning. However, measuring the impacts of burning or the effectiveness of\ninterventions to reduce burning requires data on where burning occurred. These\ndata are challenging to collect in the field, both in terms of cost and\nfeasibility. We take advantage of data from ground-based monitoring of crop\nresidue burning in Punjab, India to explore whether burning can be detected\nmore effectively using accessible satellite imagery. Specifically, we used 3m\nPlanetScope data with high temporal resolution (up to daily) as well as\npublicly-available Sentinel-2 data with weekly temporal resolution but greater\ndepth of spectral information.

Our overall model accuracy of 82-percent is favorable given the\nchallenges presented by the measurement.

    "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) can learn policies without\nexplicitly defining the reward function from demonstrations. GAIL has the\npotential to learn policies with high-dimensional observations as input, e.g.,\nimages. By applying GAIL to a real robot, perhaps robot policies can be\nobtained for daily activities like washing, folding clothes, cooking, and\ncleaning. However, human demonstration data are often imperfect due to\nmistakes, which degrade the performance of the resulting policies. We address\nthis issue by focusing on the following features: 1) many robotic tasks are\ngoal-reaching tasks, and 2) labeling such goal states in demonstration data is\nrelatively easy. With these in mind, this paper proposes Goal-Aware Generative\nAdversarial Imitation Learning (GA-GAIL), which trains a policy by introducing\na second discriminator to distinguish the goal state in parallel with the first\ndiscriminator that indicates the demonstration data. This extends a standard\nGAIL framework to more robustly learn desirable policies even from imperfect\ndemonstrations through a goal-state discriminator that promotes achieving the\ngoal state. Furthermore, GA-GAIL employs the Entropy-maximizing Deep P-Network\n(EDPN) as a generator, which considers both the smoothness and causal entropy\nin the policy update, to achieve stable policy learning from two\ndiscriminators. Our proposed method was successfully applied to two\nreal-robotic cloth-manipulation tasks: turning a handkerchief over and folding\nclothes. We confirmed that it learns cloth-manipulation policies without\ntask-specific reward function design. Video of the real experiments are\navailable at https://youtu.be/h_nII2ooUrE.",

In addition, existing benchmark datasets\nof either FPV or TPV have several limitations, including the limited number of\nsamples, participant subjects, interaction categories, and modalities. In this\nwork, we contribute a large-scale human interaction dataset, namely, FT-HID\ndataset. FT-HID contains pair-aligned samples of first person and third person\nvisions.

    "abstract": "Graph anomaly detection (GAD) is a vital task since even a few anomalies can\npose huge threats to benign users. Recent semi-supervised GAD methods, which\ncan effectively leverage the available labels as prior knowledge, have achieved\nsuperior performances than unsupervised methods. In practice, people usually\nneed to identify anomalies on new (sub)graphs to secure their business, but\nthey may lack labels to train an effective detection model. One natural idea is\nto directly adopt a trained GAD model to the new (sub)graph for testing.\nHowever, we find that existing semi-supervised GAD methods suffer from poor\ngeneralization issue, i.e., well-trained models could not perform well on an\nunseen area (i.e., not accessible in training) of the same graph. It may cause\ngreat troubles. In this paper, we base on the phenomenon and propose a general\nand novel research problem of generalized graph anomaly detection that aims to\neffectively identify anomalies on both the training-domain graph and unseen\ntesting graph to eliminate potential dangers. Nevertheless, it is a challenging\ntask since only limited labels are available, and the normal background may\ndiffer between training and testing data. Accordingly, we propose a data\naugmentation method named \\textit{AugAN} (\\uline{Aug}mentation for\n\\uline{A}nomaly and \\uline{N}ormal distributions) to enrich training data and\nboost the generalizability of GAD models.

That is, it tends to be more difficult to improve the\ncontribution of the acoustic modality for the whole multimodal emotion\nrecognition task. Besides, although better performance can be obtained by\nintroducing common deep learning methods, the complex structures of these\ntraining models always result in low inference efficiency, especially when\nexposed to high-resolution and long-length videos. Moreover, the lack of a\nfully end-to-end multimodal video emotion recognition system hinders its\napplication. In this paper, we designed a fully multimodal video-to-emotion\nsystem (named FV2ES) for fast yet effective recognition inference, whose\nbenefits are threefold: (1) The adoption of the hierarchical attention method\nupon the sound spectra breaks through the limited contribution of the acoustic\nmodality and outperforms the existing models' performance on both IEMOCAP and\nCMU-MOSEI datasets; (2) the introduction of the idea of multi-scale for visual\nextraction while single-branch for inference brings higher efficiency and\nmaintains the prediction accuracy at the same time; (3) the further integration\nof data pre-processing into the aligned multimodal learning model allows the\nsignificant reduction of computational costs and storage space.",

    "abstract": "Although recent gaze estimation methods lay great emphasis on attentively\nextracting gaze-relevant features from facial or eye images, how to define\nfeatures that include gaze-relevant components has been ambiguous. This\nobscurity makes the model learn not only gaze-relevant features but also\nirrelevant ones.

Furthermore, by utilizing\nGAN-based encoder-generator process, we shift the input image from the target\ndomain to the source domain image, which a gaze estimator is sufficiently\naware. In addition, we propose gaze distortion loss in the encoder that\nprevents the distortion of gaze information.

    "abstract": "We introduce the first learning-based reconstructability predictor to improve\nview and path planning for large-scale 3D urban scene acquisition using\nunmanned drones. In contrast to previous heuristic approaches, our method\nlearns a model that explicitly predicts how well a 3D urban scene will be\nreconstructed from a set of viewpoints. To make such a model trainable and\nsimultaneously applicable to drone path planning, we simulate the proxy-based\n3D scene reconstruction during training to set up the prediction. Specifically,\nthe neural network we design is trained to predict the scene reconstructability\nas a function of the proxy geometry, a set of viewpoints, and optionally a\nseries of scene images acquired in flight. To reconstruct a new urban scene, we\nfirst build the 3D scene proxy, then rely on the predicted reconstruction\nquality and uncertainty measures by our network, based off of the proxy\ngeometry, to guide the drone path planning. We demonstrate that our data-driven\nreconstructability predictions are more closely correlated to the true\nreconstruction quality than prior heuristic measures. Further, our learned\npredictor can be easily integrated into existing path planners to yield\nimprovements. Finally, we devise a new iterative view planning framework, based\non the learned reconstructability, and show superior performance of the new\nplanner when reconstructing both synthetic and real scenes.",

    "abstract": "DRAM is the building block of modern main memory systems. DRAM cells must be\nperiodically refreshed to prevent data loss. Refresh operations degrade system\nperformance by interfering with memory accesses. As DRAM chip density increases\nwith technology node scaling, refresh operations also increase because: 1) the\nnumber of DRAM rows in a chip increases; and 2) DRAM cells need additional\nrefresh operations to mitigate bit failures caused by RowHammer, a failure\nmechanism that becomes worse with technology node scaling. Thus, it is critical\nto enable refresh operations at low performance overhead. To this end, we\npropose a new operation, Hidden Row Activation (HiRA), and the HiRA Memory\nController (HiRA-MC).\nHiRA hides a refresh operation's latency by refreshing a row concurrently\nwith accessing or refreshing another row within the same bank. Unlike prior\nworks, HiRA achieves this parallelism without any modifications to\noff-the-shelf DRAM chips. To do so, it leverages the new observation that two\nrows in the same bank can be activated without data loss if the rows are\nconnected to different charge restoration circuitry. We experimentally\ndemonstrate on 56% real off-the-shelf DRAM chips that HiRA can reliably\nparallelize a DRAM row's refresh operation with refresh or activation of any of\nthe 32% of the rows within the same bank. By doing so, HiRA reduces the overall\nlatency of two refresh operations by 51.4%.\nHiRA-MC modifies the memory request scheduler to perform HiRA when a refresh\noperation can be performed concurrently with a memory access or another\nrefresh. Our system-level evaluations show that HiRA-MC increases system\nperformance by 12.6% and 3.73x as it reduces the performance degradation due to\nperiodic refreshes and refreshes for RowHammer protection (preventive\nrefreshes), respectively, for future DRAM chips with increased density and\nRowHammer vulnerability.",

In the proposed\nbitwidth FL scheme, edge devices train and transmit quantized versions of their\nlocal FL model parameters to a coordinating server, which, in turn, aggregates\nthem into a quantized global model and synchronizes the devices. The goal is to\njointly determine the bitwidths employed for local FL model quantization and\nthe set of devices participating in FL training at each iteration. This problem\nis posed as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the training loss\nof quantized FL under a per-iteration device sampling budget and delay\nrequirement. To derive the solution, an analytical characterization is\nperformed in order to show how the limited wireless resources and induced\nquantization errors affect the performance of the proposed FL method. The\nanalytical results show that the improvement of FL training loss between two\nconsecutive iterations depends on the device selection and quantization scheme\nas well as on several parameters inherent to the model being learned. Given\nlinear regression-based estimates of these model properties, it is shown that\nthe FL training process can be described as a Markov decision process (MDP),\nand, then, a model-based reinforcement learning (RL) method is proposed to\noptimize action selection over iterations. Compared to model-free RL, this\nmodel-based RL approach leverages the derived mathematical characterization of\nthe FL training process to discover an effective device selection and\nquantization scheme without imposing additional device communication overhead.\nSimulation results show that the proposed FL algorithm can reduce 29% and 63%\nconvergence time compared to a model free RL method and the standard FL method,\nrespectively.",

One popular approach is to formulate\nit as an optimization problem using the generalized median. Previous methods\nlike the Prototype and Distance-Preserving Embedding methods transform objects\ninto a vector space, solve the generalized median problem in this space, and\ninversely transform back into the original space. Both of these methods have\nbeen successfully applied to a wide range of object domains, where the\ngeneralized median problem has inherent high computational complexity\n(typically $\\mathcal{NP}$-hard) and therefore approximate solutions are\nrequired. Previously, explicit embedding methods were used in the computation,\nwhich often do not reflect the spatial relationship between objects exactly. In\nthis work we introduce a kernel-based generalized median framework that is\napplicable to both positive definite and indefinite kernels. This framework\ncomputes the relationship between objects and its generalized median in kernel\nspace, without the need of an explicit embedding. We show that the spatial\nrelationship between objects is more accurately represented in kernel space\nthan in an explicit vector space using easy-to-compute kernels, and demonstrate\nsuperior performance of generalized median computation on datasets of three\ndifferent domains.

    "abstract": "Real-time character animation in dynamic environments requires the generation\nof plausible upper-body movements regardless of the nature of the environment,\nincluding non-rigid obstacles such as vegetation. We propose a flexible model\nfor upper-body interactions, based on the anticipation of the character's\nsurroundings, and on antagonistic controllers to adapt the amount of muscular\nstiffness and response time to better deal with obstacles. Our solution relies\non a hybrid method for character animation that couples a keyframe sequence\nwith kinematic constraints and lightweight physics. The dynamic response of the\ncharacter's upper-limbs leverages antagonistic controllers, allowing us to tune\ntension/relaxation in the upper-body without diverging from the reference\nkeyframe motion. A new sight model, controlled by procedural rules, enables\nhigh-level authoring of the way the character generates interactions by\nadapting its stiffness and reaction time. As results show, our real-time method\noffers precise and explicit control over the character's behavior and style,\nwhile seamlessly adapting to new situations. Our model is therefore well suited\nfor gaming applications.",

    "abstract": "When we move on snow, sand, or mud, the ground deforms under our feet,\nimmediately affecting our gait. We propose a physically based model for\ncomputing such interactions in real time, from only the kinematic motion of a\nvirtual character. The force applied by each foot on the ground during contact\nis estimated from the weight of the character, its current balance, the foot\nspeed at the time of contact, and the nature of the ground. We rely on a\nstandard stress-strain relationship to compute the dynamic deformation of the\nsoil under this force, where the amount of compression and lateral displacement\nof material are, respectively, parameterized by the soil's Young modulus and\nPoisson ratio. The resulting footprint is efficiently applied to the terrain\nthrough procedural deformations of refined terrain patches, while the addition\nof a simple controller on top of a kinematic character enables capturing the\neffect of ground deformation on the character's gait. As our results show, the\nresulting footprints greatly improve visual realism, while ground compression\nresults in consistent changes in the character's motion. Readily applicable to\nany locomotion gait and soft soil material, our real-time model is ideal for\nenhancing the visual realism of outdoor scenes in video games and virtual\nreality applications.",

    "abstract": "Despite a surge of recent advances in promoting machine Learning (ML)\nfairness, the existing mainstream approaches mostly require training or\nfinetuning the entire weights of the neural network to meet the fairness\ncriteria. However, this is often infeasible in practice for those large-scale\ntrained models due to large computational and storage costs, low data\nefficiency, and model privacy issues. In this paper, we propose a new generic\nfairness learning paradigm, called FairReprogram, which incorporates the model\nreprogramming technique. Specifically, FairReprogram considers the neural model\nfixed, and instead appends to the input a set of perturbations, called the\nfairness trigger, which is tuned towards the fairness criteria under a min-max\nformulation. We further introduce an information-theoretic framework that\nexplains why and under what conditions fairness goals can be achieved using the\nfairness trigger. We show both theoretically and empirically that the fairness\ntrigger can effectively obscure demographic biases in the output prediction of\nfixed ML models by providing false demographic information that hinders the\nmodel from utilizing the correct demographic information to make the\nprediction. Extensive experiments on both NLP and CV datasets demonstrate that\nour method can achieve better fairness improvements than retraining-based\nmethods with far less training cost and data dependency under two widely-used\nfairness criteria.",

    "abstract": "Most automatic emotion recognition systems exploit time-continuous\nannotations of emotion to provide fine-grained descriptions of spontaneous\nexpressions as observed in real-life interactions. As emotion is rather\nsubjective, its annotation is usually performed by several annotators who\nprovide a trace for a given dimension, i.e. a time-continuous series describing\na dimension such as arousal or valence. However, annotations of the same\nexpression are rarely consistent between annotators, either in time or in\nvalue, which adds bias and delay in the trace that is used to learn predictive\nmodels of emotion. We therefore propose a method that can dynamically\ncompensate inconsistencies across annotations and synchronise the traces with\nthe corresponding acoustic features using Recurrent Neural Networks.\nExperimental evaluations were carried on several emotion data sets that include\nChinese, French, German, and Hungarian participants who interacted remotely in\neither noise-free conditions or in-the-wild. The results show that our method\ncan significantly increase inter-annotator agreement, as well as correlation\nbetween traces and audio features, for both arousal and valence.

    "abstract": "Social networks are the natural space for the spreading of information and\ninfluence and have become a media themselves. Several models capturing that\ndiffusion process have been proposed, most of them based on the Independent\nCascade (IC) model or on the Linear Threshold (LT) model. The IC model is\nprobabilistic while the LT model relies on the knowledge of an actor to be\nconvinced, reflected in an associated individual threshold.\nAlthough the LT-based models contemplate an individual threshold for each\nactor in the network, the existing studies so far have always considered a\nthreshold of 0.5 equal in all actors (i.e., a simple majority activation\ncriterion).\nOur main objective in this work is to start the study on how the\ndissemination of information on networks behaves when we consider other options\nfor setting those thresholds and how many network actors end up being\ninfluenced by this dissemination. For doing so, we consider a recently\nintroduced centrality measure based on the LT model, the Forward Linear\nThreshold Rank (FLTR). We analyze experimentally the ranking properties for\nseveral networks in which the influence resistance threshold follows different\nschemes. Here we consider three different schemes: (1) uniform, in which all\nplayers have the same value; (2) random, where each player is assigned a\nthreshold u.a.r. in a prescribed interval; and (3) determined by the value of\nanother centrality measure on the actor. Our results show that the selection\nhas a clear impact on the ranking, even quite significant and abrupt in some\ncases. We conclude that the social networks ranks that provide the best\nassignments for the individual thresholds are PageRank and FLTR.",

In this work we\nconsider the possibility of an insider adversary who is within physical\nproximity of a robotic system (such as a technician or robot operator),\nequipped with only their smartphone microphone. Through the acoustic\nside-channel, we demonstrate that it is indeed possible to fingerprint not only\nindividual robot movements within 3D space, but also patterns of movements\nwhich could lead to inferring the purpose of the movements (i.e. surgical\nprocedures which a surgical robot is undertaking) and hence, resulting in\npotential privacy violations. Upon evaluation, we find that individual robot\nmovements can be fingerprinted with around 75% accuracy, decreasing slightly\nwith more fine-grained movement meta-data such as distance and speed.\nFurthermore, workflows could be reconstructed with around 62% accuracy as a\nwhole, with more complex movements such as pick-and-place or packing\nreconstructed with near perfect accuracy. As well as this, in some environments\nsuch as surgical settings, audio may be recorded and transmitted over VoIP,\nsuch as for education/teaching purposes or in remote telemedicine. The question\nhere is, can the same attack be successful even when VoIP communication is\nemployed, and how does packet loss impact the captured audio and the success of\nthe attack? Using the same characteristics of acoustic sound for plain audio\ncaptured by the smartphone, the attack was 90% accurate in fingerprinting VoIP\nsamples on average, 15% higher than the baseline without the VoIP codec\nemployed. This opens up new research questions regarding anonymous\ncommunications to protect robotic systems from acoustic side channel attacks\nvia VoIP communication networks.",

In ALP, accelerators are used concurrently to provide\nunprecedented levels of performance and energy efficiency. To reach that, there\nare many problems to be solved, one of the most challenging being co-execution.\nThis paper develops a scheduling framework called POAS, a general method for\nproviding co-execution to generic applications. Unlike other scheduling\napproaches, POAS does not directly schedule applications. Instead, it is a\ngeneric model that transforms any application to make it suitable for\nco-execution, so that it can be executed in ALP environments. Our proposal is\ncomposed of four differentiated steps: predict, optimize, adapt and schedule.\nDuring these phases, different modifications are implemented in the application\nto make it suitable to be executed in ALP environments. In this work we also\napply our framework to a matrix multiplication case study, outlining the\ncritical and most important steps to port the application with POAS.\nWe evaluate our POAS-based implementation for matrix multiplication on a\nCPU/GPU/XPU environment using CPU cores, CUDA cores and tensor cores (XPU). Our\nexperiments prove that co-execution in the studied scenario can benefit from\nALP, yielding speedups of up to 45% with respect to using only one accelerator.\nThe proven flexibility and potential of POAS make it an excellent candidate to\nreach ALP in future computer systems.",

    "title": "PTSG: a test generation tool based on extended finite state machine",
    "abstract": "The Extended Finite State Machine (EFSM) is one of the most popular modeling\napproaches for model-based testing. However, EFSM-based test case generation is\nsusceptible to the infeasible (inexecutable) path problem, which stems from the\nconflict of predicates (guards) between transitions in the path. Therefore, in\norder to derive feasible test cases, a test generation algorithm needs to\ndynamically acquire information about the model and verify the feasibility of\nthe generated test path through the simulation execution of the model. The\ntraditional method of constructing executable models using hard-coding for\ndifferent EFSM models under test has limitations such as inflexibility,\ntime-consuming and error-prone. To address this issue, this paper develops an\nopen source test generation tool for testing EFSM-specified systems, PTSG, to\nsupport the automatic generation of executable test cases. It decouples the\nEFSM model description, parsing and simulation execution functions from the\ntest generation algorithm, which can effectively improve the efficiency and\nquality of test generation. In particular, PTSG first uses a well-designed JSON\nsyntax to describe the specific EFSM under test. Then, based on the model\ndescription file, it uses lexical and syntactic parsers to dynamically extract\nmodel information to construct various model objects in memory such as state\nconfigurations, transitions, etc. Finally, the tool provide a series of service\ninterfaces to support model information acquisition, transition feasibility\nevaluation, and model simulation execution. A case study of test sequence\ngeneration for the SCP protocol model demonstrates the capability and promise\nof the PTSG to serve executable test cases.",

One of the most basic problems in this area is\nthe $2$-Edge-Connected Spanning Subgraph problem (2-ECSS): given an undirected\ngraph $G$, find a $2$-edge-connected spanning subgraph $H$ of $G$ with the\nminimum number of edges (in particular, $H$ remains connected after the removal\nof one arbitrary edge).\n2-ECSS is NP-hard and the best-known (polynomial-time) approximation factor\nfor this problem is $4/3$.

    "abstract": "Open-source journalism emerged as a new phenomenon in the media ecosystem,\nwhich uses crowdsourcing to fact-check and generate investigative reports for\nworld events using open sources (e.g., social media). A particularly prominent\nexample is Bellingcat. Bellingcat is known for its investigations on the\nillegal use of chemical weapons during the Syrian war, the Russian\nresponsibility for downing flight MH17, the identification of the perpetrators\nin the attempted murder of Alexei Navalny, and war crimes in the Russo-Ukraine\nwar. Crucial for this is social media in order to disseminate findings and\ncrowdsource fact-checks. In this work, we characterize the social media\nactivities at Bellingcat on Twitter. For this, we built a comprehensive dataset\nof all N = 24,682 tweets posted by Bellingcat on Twitter since its inception in\nJanuary 2014. Our analysis is three-fold: (1) We analyze how Bellingcat uses\nTwitter to disseminate information and collect information from its follower\nbase. Here, we find a steady increase in both posts and replies over time,\nparticularly during the Russo-Ukrainian war, which is in line with the growing\nimportance of Bellingcat for the traditional media ecosystem. (2) We identify\ncharacteristics of posts that are successful in eliciting user engagement. User\nengagement is particularly large for posts embedding additional media items and\nwith a more negative sentiment. (3) We examine how the follower base has\nresponded to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Here, we find that the sentiment\nhas become more polarized and negative. We attribute this to a ~13-fold\nincrease in bots interacting with the Bellingcat account. Overall, our findings\nprovide recommendations for how open-source journalism such as Bellingcat can\nsuccessfully operate on social media.",

To the best of our knowledge, this variant has not been considered\nbefore.We call it the Dispersive Art Gallery Problem. In particular, in the\ndispersive art gallery problem we are given a polygon $\\mathcal{P}$ and a real\nnumber $\\ell$, and want to decide whether $\\mathcal{P}$ has a guard set such\nthat every pair of guards in this set is at least a distance of $\\ell$ apart.\nIn this paper, we study the vertex guard variant of this problem for the\nclass of polyominoes. We consider rectangular visibility and distances as\ngeodesics in the $L_1$-metric. Our results are as follows. We give a (simple)\nthin polyomino such that every guard set has minimum pairwise distances of at\nmost $3$. On the positive side, we describe an algorithm that computes guard\nsets for simple polyominoes that match this upper bound, i.e., the algorithm\nconstructs worst-case optimal solutions. We also study the computational\ncomplexity of computing guard sets that maximize the smallest distance between\nall pairs of guards within the guard sets. We prove that deciding whether there\nexists a guard set realizing a minimum pairwise distance for all pairs of\nguards of at least $5$ in a given polyomino is NP-complete.\nWe were also able to find an optimal dynamic programming approach that\ncomputes a guard set that maximizes the minimum pairwise distance between\nguards in tree-shaped polyominoes, i.e., computes optimal solutions. Because\nthe shapes constructed in the NP-hardness reduction are thin as well (but have\nholes), this result completes the case for thin polyominoes.",

The caveat here is that only influential people can make such an\nonline polling and reach out at a mass scale. Further, in such cases, the\ndistribution of voters is not controllable and may be, in fact, biased. On the\nother hand,if we can interpret the publicly available data over social media to\nprobe the political inclination of users, we will be able to have controllable\ninsights about the survey population, keep the cost of survey low and also\ncollect publicly available data without involving the concerned persons. Hence\nwe introduce a self-attentive semi-supervised framework for political\ninclination detection to further that objective.

    "abstract": "Payment channel is a class of techniques designed to solve the scalability\nproblem of blockchain. By establishing channels off the blockchain to form\npayment channel networks (PCNs), users can make instant payments without\ninteracting with the blockchain, avoiding the problems of long transaction\nconsensus delays and high transaction fees. Recently, the optimization of PCNs\nhas mainly focused on improving the network throughput via multi-path routing.\nHowever, the transaction's atomicity comes at a non-trivial cost for\ntransaction completion latency that affects user experience in\ndeadline-sensitive applications of PCNs, which is ignored by previous work. For\nthe first time, we propose a new framework DPCN to consider the deadlines of\ntransactions for payment channel networks while improving the success ratio of\ntransactions. DPCN is enabled via a synergy of three components: (1)\ndeadline-based dynamic transaction split mechanism that splits the transaction\naccording to current network status and the transaction's deadline;\n(2)deadline-aware transaction scheduling that prioritizes near-deadline\ntransactions; (3) deadline-aware transaction congestion avoidance algorithm,\nwhich uses a path window to balance transactions with different deadlines. Our\nextensive experiments show that compared with existing methods, DPCN can well\nmeet the needs of transactions with different deadlines and ensure a higher\nsuccess ratio for transactions in the payment channel networks.",

    "abstract": "Despite the tremendous progress in zero-shot learning(ZSL), the majority of\nexisting methods still rely on human-annotated attributes, which are difficult\nto annotate and scale. An unsupervised alternative is to represent each class\nusing the word embedding associated with its semantic class name. However, word\nembeddings extracted from pre-trained language models do not necessarily\ncapture visual similarities, resulting in poor zero-shot performance. In this\nwork, we argue that online textual documents, e.g., Wikipedia, contain rich\nvisual descriptions about object classes, therefore can be used as powerful\nunsupervised side information for ZSL. To this end, we propose I2DFormer, a\nnovel transformer-based ZSL framework that jointly learns to encode images and\ndocuments by aligning both modalities in a shared embedding space. In order to\ndistill discriminative visual words from noisy documents, we introduce a new\ncross-modal attention module that learns fine-grained interactions between\nimage patches and document words. Consequently, our I2DFormer not only learns\nhighly discriminative document embeddings that capture visual similarities but\nalso gains the ability to localize visually relevant words in image regions.\nQuantitatively, we demonstrate that our I2DFormer significantly outperforms\nprevious unsupervised semantic embeddings under both zero-shot and generalized\nzero-shot learning settings on three public datasets. Qualitatively, we show\nthat our method leads to highly interpretable results where document words can\nbe grounded in the image regions.",

    "abstract": "Although current deep learning-based methods have gained promising\nperformance in the blind single image super-resolution (SISR) task, most of\nthem mainly focus on heuristically constructing diverse network architectures\nand put less emphasis on the explicit embedding of the physical generation\nmechanism between blur kernels and high-resolution (HR) images. To alleviate\nthis issue, we propose a model-driven deep neural network, called KXNet, for\nblind SISR. Specifically, to solve the classical SISR model, we propose a\nsimple-yet-effective iterative algorithm. Then by unfolding the involved\niterative steps into the corresponding network module, we naturally construct\nthe KXNet. The main specificity of the proposed KXNet is that the entire\nlearning process is fully and explicitly integrated with the inherent physical\nmechanism underlying this SISR task. Thus, the learned blur kernel has clear\nphysical patterns and the mutually iterative process between blur kernel and HR\nimage can soundly guide the KXNet to be evolved in the right direction.\nExtensive experiments on synthetic and real data finely demonstrate the\nsuperior accuracy and generality of our method beyond the current\nrepresentative state-of-the-art blind SISR methods.

However, the recent MedISeg publications usually focus\non presentations of the major contributions (e.g., network architectures,\ntraining strategies, and loss functions) while unwittingly ignoring some\nmarginal implementation details (also known as \"tricks\"), leading to a\npotential problem of the unfair experimental result comparisons. In this paper,\nwe collect a series of MedISeg tricks for different model implementation phases\n(i.e., pre-training model, data pre-processing, data augmentation, model\nimplementation, model inference, and result post-processing), and\nexperimentally explore the effectiveness of these tricks on the consistent\nbaseline models. Compared to paper-driven surveys that only blandly focus on\nthe advantages and limitation analyses of segmentation models, our work\nprovides a large number of solid experiments and is more technically operable.\nWith the extensive experimental results on both the representative 2D and 3D\nmedical image datasets, we explicitly clarify the effect of these tricks.\nMoreover, based on the surveyed tricks, we also open-sourced a strong MedISeg\nrepository, where each of its components has the advantage of plug-and-play. We\nbelieve that this milestone work not only completes a comprehensive and\ncomplementary survey of the state-of-the-art MedISeg approaches, but also\noffers a practical guide for addressing the future medical image processing\nchallenges including but not limited to small dataset learning, class imbalance\nlearning, multi-modality learning, and domain adaptation.

Here we\nare interested on how Angluin's PAC learning algorithm behaves for devices\nwhich are obtained from a DFA by introducing some noise. More precisely we\nstudy whether Angluin's algorithm reduces the noise and produces a DFA closer\nto the original one than the noisy device. We propose several ways to introduce\nthe noise: (1) the noisy device inverts the classification of words w.r.t. the\nDFA with a small probability, (2) the noisy device modifies with a small\nprobability the letters of the word before asking its classification w.r.t. the\nDFA, and (3) the noisy device combines the classification of a word w.r.t. the\nDFA and its classification w.r.t. a counter automaton.

    "abstract": "Recently, interest has been emerging in the application of symbolic\ntechniques to the specification and analysis of cryptosystems. These\ntechniques, when accompanied by suitable proofs of soundness/completeness, can\nbe used both to identify insecure cryptosystems and prove sound ones secure.\nBut although a number of such symbolic algorithms have been developed and\nimplemented, they remain scattered throughout the literature. In this paper, we\npresent a tool, CryptoSolve, which provides a common basis for specification\nand implementation of these algorithms, CryptoSolve includes libraries that\nprovide the term algebras used to express symbolic cryptographic systems, as\nwell as implementations of useful algorithms, such as unification and variant\ngeneration. In its current initial iteration, it features several algorithms\nfor the generation and analysis of cryptographic modes of operation, which\nallow one to use block ciphers to encrypt messages more than one block long.\nThe goal of our work is to continue expanding the tool in order to consider\nadditional cryptosystems and security questions, as well as extend the symbolic\nlibraries to increase their applicability.",

    "abstract": "Security is a subject of increasing attention in our actual society in order\nto protect critical resources from information disclosure, theft or damage. The\ninformal model of attack trees introduced by Schneier, and widespread in the\nindustry, is advocated in the 2008 NATO report to govern the evaluation of the\nthreat in risk analysis. Attack-defense trees have since been the subject of\nmany theoretical works addressing different formal approaches.\nIn 2017, M. Audinot et al. introduced a path semantics over a transition\nsystem for attack trees. Inspired by the later, we propose a two-player\ninterpretation of the attack-tree formalism. To do so, we replace transition\nsystems by concurrent game arenas and our associated semantics consist of\nstrategies. We then show that the emptiness problem, known to be NP-complete\nfor the path semantics, is now PSPACE-complete. Additionally, we show that the\nmembership problem is coNP-complete for our two-player interpretation while it\ncollapses to P in the path semantics.",

In most\ncases, the texts naturally attach to the surface of the objects. Therefore,\nspatial reasoning between texts and objects is crucial in TextVQA. However,\nexisting approaches are constrained within 2D spatial information learned from\nthe input images and rely on transformer-based architectures to reason\nimplicitly during the fusion process.

    "abstract": "Existing multi-scale solutions lead to a risk of just increasing the\nreceptive field sizes while neglecting small receptive fields. Thus, it is a\nchallenging problem to effectively construct adaptive neural networks for\nrecognizing various spatial-scale objects. To tackle this issue, we first\nintroduce a new attention dimension, i.e., depth, in addition to existing\nattention dimensions such as channel, spatial, and branch, and present a novel\nselective depth attention network to symmetrically handle multi-scale objects\nin various vision tasks. Specifically, the blocks within each stage of a given\nneural network, i.e., ResNet, output hierarchical feature maps sharing the same\nresolution but with different receptive field sizes. Based on this structural\nproperty, we design a stage-wise building module, namely SDA, which includes a\ntrunk branch and a SE-like attention branch. The block outputs of the trunk\nbranch are fused to globally guide their depth attention allocation through the\nattention branch. According to the proposed attention mechanism, we can\ndynamically select different depth features, which contributes to adaptively\nadjusting the receptive field sizes for the variable-sized input objects. In\nthis way, the cross-block information interaction leads to a long-range\ndependency along the depth direction. Compared with other multi-scale\napproaches, our SDA method combines multiple receptive fields from previous\nblocks into the stage output, thus offering a wider and richer range of\neffective receptive fields. Moreover, our method can be served as a pluggable\nmodule to other multi-scale networks as well as attention networks, coined as\nSDA-$x$Net. Their combination further extends the range of the effective\nreceptive fields towards small receptive fields, enabling interpretable neural\nnetworks.

    "abstract": "Communicating state machines provide a formal foundation for distributed\ncomputation. Unfortunately, they are Turing-complete and, thus, challenging to\nanalyse. In this paper, we classify restrictions on channels which have been\nproposed to work around the undecidability of verification questions. We\ncompare half-duplex communication, existential B-boundedness, and\nk-synchronisability. These restrictions do not prevent the communication\nchannels from growing arbitrarily large but still restrict the power of the\nmodel. Each restriction gives rise to a set of languages so, for every pair of\nrestrictions, we check whether one subsumes the other or if they are\nincomparable. We investigate their relationship in two different contexts:\nfirst, the one of communicating state machines, and, second, the one of\ncommunication protocol specifications using high-level message sequence charts.\nSurprisingly, these two contexts yield different conclusions. In addition, we\nintegrate multiparty session types, another approach to specify communication\nprotocols, into our classification. We show that multiparty session type\nlanguages are half-duplex, existentially 1-bounded, and 1-synchronisable. To\nshow this result, we provide the first formal embedding of multiparty session\ntypes into high-level message sequence charts.",

    "abstract": "In conventional multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems\nwith frequency division duplexing (FDD), channel acquisition and precoder\noptimization processes have been designed separately although they are highly\ncoupled. This paper studies an end-to-end design of downlink MU-MIMO systems\nwhich include pilot sequences, limited feedback, and precoding. To address this\nproblem, we propose a novel deep learning (DL) framework which jointly\noptimizes the feedback information generation at users and the precoder design\nat a base station (BS). Each procedure in the MU-MIMO systems is replaced by\nintelligently designed multiple deep neural networks (DNN) units. At the BS, a\nneural network generates pilot sequences and helps the users obtain accurate\nchannel state information. At each user, the channel feedback operation is\ncarried out in a distributed manner by an individual user DNN. Then, another BS\nDNN collects feedback information from the users and determines the MIMO\nprecoding matrices. A joint training algorithm is proposed to optimize all DNN\nunits in an end-to-end manner. In addition, a training strategy which can avoid\nretraining for different network sizes for a scalable design is proposed.\nNumerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DL framework\ncompared to classical optimization techniques and other conventional DNN\nschemes.",

While existing\nstudies investigate bias in different domains, they are limited in addressing\nfine-grained analysis on educational and multilingual corpora. In this work, we\nanalyze bias across text and through multiple architectures on a corpus of\n9,165 German peer-reviews collected from university students over five years.\nNotably, our corpus includes labels such as helpfulness, quality, and critical\naspect ratings from the peer-review recipient as well as demographic\nattributes. We conduct a Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT) analysis on (1)\nour collected corpus in connection with the clustered labels, (2) the most\ncommon pre-trained German language models (T5, BERT, and GPT-2) and GloVe\nembeddings, and (3) the language models after fine-tuning on our collected\ndata-set. In contrast to our initial expectations, we found that our collected\ncorpus does not reveal many biases in the co-occurrence analysis or in the\nGloVe embeddings. However, the pre-trained German language models find\nsubstantial conceptual, racial, and gender bias and have significant changes in\nbias across conceptual and racial axes during fine-tuning on the peer-review\ndata.

    "abstract": "Data-free Knowledge Distillation (DFKD) has attracted attention recently\nthanks to its appealing capability of transferring knowledge from a teacher\nnetwork to a student network without using training data. The main idea is to\nuse a generator to synthesize data for training the student. As the generator\ngets updated, the distribution of synthetic data will change. Such distribution\nshift could be large if the generator and the student are trained\nadversarially, causing the student to forget the knowledge it acquired at\nprevious steps. To alleviate this problem, we propose a simple yet effective\nmethod called Momentum Adversarial Distillation (MAD) which maintains an\nexponential moving average (EMA) copy of the generator and uses synthetic\nsamples from both the generator and the EMA generator to train the student.\nSince the EMA generator can be considered as an ensemble of the generator's old\nversions and often undergoes a smaller change in updates compared to the\ngenerator, training on its synthetic samples can help the student recall the\npast knowledge and prevent the student from adapting too quickly to new updates\nof the generator. Our experiments on six benchmark datasets including big\ndatasets like ImageNet and Places365 demonstrate the superior performance of\nMAD over competing methods for handling the large distribution shift problem.\nOur method also compares favorably to existing DFKD methods and even achieves\nstate-of-the-art results in some cases.",

    "abstract": "The increasing penetration of renewable energy poses significant challenges\nto power grid reliability. There have been increasing interests in utilizing\nfinancial tools, such as insurance, to help end-users hedge the potential risk\nof lost load due to renewable energy variability. With insurance, a user pays a\npremium fee to the utility, so that he will get compensated in case his demand\nis not fully satisfied. A proper insurance design needs to resolve the\nfollowing two challenges: (i) users' reliability preference is private\ninformation; and (ii) the insurance design is tightly coupled with the\nrenewable energy investment decision. To address these challenges, we adopt the\ncontract theory to elicit users' private reliability preferences, and we study\nhow the utility can jointly optimize the insurance contract and the planning of\nrenewable energy. A key analytical challenge is that the joint optimization of\nthe insurance design and the planning of renewables is non-convex. We resolve\nthis difficulty by revealing important structural properties of the optimal\nsolution, using the help of two benchmark problems: the no-insurance benchmark\nand the social-optimum benchmark. Compared with the no-insurance benchmark, we\nprove that the social cost and users' total energy cost are always no larger\nunder the optimal contract. Simulation results show that the largest benefit of\nthe insurance contract is achieved at a medium electricity-bill price together\nwith a low type heterogeneity and a high renewable uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "Partial-label learning (PLL) is a peculiar weakly-supervised learning task\nwhere the training samples are generally associated with a set of candidate\nlabels instead of single ground truth. While a variety of label disambiguation\nmethods have been proposed in this domain, they normally assume a\nclass-balanced scenario that may not hold in many real-world applications.\nEmpirically, we observe degenerated performance of the prior methods when\nfacing the combinatorial challenge from the long-tailed distribution and\npartial-labeling. In this work, we first identify the major reasons that the\nprior work failed. We subsequently propose SoLar, a novel Optimal\nTransport-based framework that allows to refine the disambiguated labels\ntowards matching the marginal class prior distribution. SoLar additionally\nincorporates a new and systematic mechanism for estimating the long-tailed\nclass prior distribution under the PLL setup. Through extensive experiments,\nSoLar exhibits substantially superior results on standardized benchmarks\ncompared to the previous state-of-the-art PLL methods.

To this end,\nadvanced communication technologies such as massive multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO) and mm-wave beamforming have been developed in recent\nyears to use radio resources more effectively. However, efficient beamforming\npotentially also increases the electromagnetic field exposure (EMFE) for\ncertain users. Thus, EMFE is currently gaining increased attention from both\nregulatory authorities and the public and should be part of the design criteria\nfor evolved 5G and 6G mobile communications. Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface\n(RIS) has emerged as a promising future technical candidate as it can program\nthe radio environment and obtain the desired propagation paths, which\npotentially could also help to control EMFE. To this end, recent research\nstudies have addressed the beamforming design at both the base station (BS) and\nthe RIS with limited beam power requirements as EMF constraints. In this work,\ntreating the EMF requirement as an opportunity instead of just a limitation, we\nconsider different cases where the non-intended user (NIU), either in between\nthe BS and the intended user (IU) or alongside the IU, could help the network\ndesign. Specifically, we investigate the potential of EMF-constrained\nRIS-assisted networks with power allocation between the direct BS-IU and the\nin-direct BS-RIS-IU paths and efficient beamforming methods.

    "abstract": "Network architecture search (NAS), in particular the differentiable\narchitecture search (DARTS) method, has shown a great power to learn excellent\nmodel architectures on the specific dataset of interest. In contrast to using a\nfixed dataset, in this work, we focus on a different but important scenario for\nNAS: how to refine a deployed network's model architecture to enhance its\nrobustness with the guidance of a few collected and misclassified examples that\nare degraded by some real-world unknown corruptions having a specific pattern\n(e.g., noise, blur, etc.). To this end, we first conduct an empirical study to\nvalidate that the model architectures can be definitely related to the\ncorruption patterns. Surprisingly, by just adding a few corrupted and\nmisclassified examples (e.g., $10^3$ examples) to the clean training dataset\n(e.g., $5.0 \\times 10^4$ examples), we can refine the model architecture and\nenhance the robustness significantly. To make it more practical, the key\nproblem, i.e., how to select the proper failure examples for the effective NAS\nguidance, should be carefully investigated. Then, we propose a novel\ncore-failure-set guided DARTS that embeds a K-center-greedy algorithm for DARTS\nto select suitable corrupted failure examples to refine the model architecture.\nWe use our method for DARTS-refined DNNs on the clean as well as 15 corruptions\nwith the guidance of four specific real-world corruptions.

    "abstract": "Task-oriented communications, mostly using learning-based joint\nsource-channel coding (JSCC), aim to design a communication-efficient edge\ninference system by transmitting task-relevant information to the receiver.\nHowever, only transmitting task-relevant information without introducing any\nredundancy may cause robustness issues in learning due to the channel\nvariations, and the JSCC which directly maps the source data into continuous\nchannel input symbols poses compatibility issues on existing digital\ncommunication systems. In this paper, we address these two issues by first\ninvestigating the inherent tradeoff between the informativeness of the encoded\nrepresentations and the robustness to information distortion in the received\nrepresentations, and then propose a task-oriented communication scheme with\ndigital modulation, named discrete task-oriented JSCC (DT-JSCC), where the\ntransmitter encodes the features into a discrete representation and transmits\nit to the receiver with the digital modulation scheme. In the DT-JSCC scheme,\nwe develop a robust encoding framework, named robust information bottleneck\n(RIB), to improve the communication robustness to the channel variations, and\nderive a tractable variational upper bound of the RIB objective function using\nthe variational approximation to overcome the computational intractability of\nmutual information. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed\nDT-JSCC achieves better inference performance than the baseline methods with\nlow communication latency, and exhibits robustness to channel variations due to\nthe applied RIB framework.",

This is made possible by two contributions working\ntogether.\nFirst, we propose a simple procedure to generate stable keypoint labels,\nwhich we use to train a recurrent architecture. This training data results in\ndetections that are very consistent over time.\nMoreover, we observe that previous methods for keypoint detection work on a\nrepresentation (such as the time surface) that integrates events over a period\nof time. Since this integration is required, we claim it is better to predict\nthe keypoints' trajectories for the time period rather than single locations,\nas done in previous approaches. We predict these trajectories in the form of a\nseries of heatmaps for the integration time period. This improves the keypoint\nlocalization.\nOur architecture can also be kept very simple, which results in very fast\ninference times. We demonstrate our approach on the HVGA ATIS Corner dataset as\nwell as \"The Event-Camera Dataset and Simulator\" dataset, and show it results\nin keypoint tracks that are three times longer and nearly twice as accurate as\nthe best previous state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "This study examines the effect of adopting cybersecurity concepts on the IT\ncurriculum and determines the potential effect on students' knowledge of\ncybersecurity practices and level of awareness. To this end, a pilot study was\nfirst conducted to measure the current level of cybersecurity awareness. The\nresults revealed that students do not have much knowledge of Cybersecurity.\nThus, a four-step approach was proposed to infuse the relevant cybersecurity\ntopics in five matched courses based on the latest Cybersecurity curricular\nguidelines (CSEC2017). A sample of 42 students was selected purposively without\nprior knowledge of Cybersecurity and divided identically into experimental and\ncontrol groups. Students in the experimental group were asked to take five\nconsecutive courses over five semesters. In each course, groups went through a\npre-test for the infused topics. Then, the experimental group taught the\ncorresponding infused topics. A post-test was administered to both groups at\nthe end of each course, and the t-test was conducted. The results found\nsignificant differences between marks of prior and post-tests for 11 out of 14\ninfused topics. These satisfactory results would encourage universities to\ninfuse cybersecurity concepts into their curriculum",

    "abstract": "Vaccinating the global population against Covid-19 is one of the biggest\nsupply chain management challenges humanity has ever faced. Rapid supply of\nCovid-19 vaccines is essential for successful global immunization, but its\neffectiveness depends on a transparent supply chain that can be monitored. In\nthis research, we have proposed an approach based on blockchain technology,\nwhich is used to ensure seamless distribution of the Covid-19 vaccine with\ntransparency, data integrity, and full traceability of the supply chain to\nreduce risk, ensure safety, and immutability. A vaccine supply chain needs to\nupdate the status of the vaccine at every stage, and any problem in the supply\nand distribution path can lead to irreparable damage. Currently, the research\nconducted on the use of blockchain in supply chains is still in the early\nstages. In this paper, the use of blockchain technology to monitor the vaccine\nsupply and distribution system will be investigated. A model close to reality\nof today's vaccine supply chains in developing countries is considered and then\na new intelligent system for vaccine monitoring in the vaccine supply chain is\ndesigned based on the considered model. Also, smart contracts based on a\nblockchain network is designed to check consumer vaccination records as well as\nvaccine circulation from beginning to end. The implementation and design of the\nvaccine supply chain is done using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain\nnetwork. Additionally, the system has been tested on both local networks, the\nHardHat suite and Rinkbey's test network. The system has also been developed to\nwork seamlessly when it is using an integrated IoT chip that can automatically\nupdate a batch's location, temperature, and other physical conditions\nperiodically.",

    "abstract": "Fluid-particle systems are highly sensitive to particle morphologies. While\nmany attempts have been made on shape descriptors and coupling schemes, how to\nsimulate the particle-particle and particle-fluid interactions with a balance\nbetween accuracy and efficiency is still a challenge, especially when\ncomplex-shaped particles are considered. This study presents a Metaball-Imaging\n(MI) based Discrete Element Lattice Boltzmann Method (DELBM) for fluid\nsimulations with irregular shaped particles. The major innovation is the MI\nalgorithm to capture the real grain shape for DELBM simulations,where the\nMetaball function is utilized as the mathematical representation due to its\nversatile and efficient expressiveness of complex shapes.The contact detection\nis tackled robustly by gradient calculation of the closest point with a\nNewton-Raphson based scheme. And the coupling with LBM is accomplished by a\nclassic sharp-interface scheme. As for refiling, a local refiling algorithm\nbased on the bounce back rule is implemented. Validations on three settling\nexperiments of irregular-shaped natural cobblestones indicate the proposed\nmodel to be effective and powerful in probing micromechanics of\nirregular-shaped granular media immersed in fluid systems. The potential of\nthis model on studies of shape-induced physical processes is further\ninvestigated with numerical examples on the \"drafting, kissing and tumbling\"\nphenomenon of pair particles in various shapes.",

    "abstract": "Software vulnerabilities existing in a program or function of computer\nsystems are a serious and crucial concern. Typically, in a program or function\nconsisting of hundreds or thousands of source code statements, there are only\nfew statements causing the corresponding vulnerabilities. Vulnerability\nlabeling is currently done on a function or program level by experts with the\nassistance of machine learning tools. Extending this approach to the code\nstatement level is much more costly and time-consuming and remains an open\nproblem. In this paper we propose a novel end-to-end deep learning-based\napproach to identify the vulnerability-relevant code statements of a specific\nfunction. Inspired by the specific structures observed in real world vulnerable\ncode, we first leverage mutual information for learning a set of latent\nvariables representing the relevance of the source code statements to the\ncorresponding function's vulnerability. We then propose novel clustered spatial\ncontrastive learning in order to further improve the representation learning\nand the robust selection process of vulnerability-relevant code statements.\nExperimental results on real-world datasets of 200k+ C/C++ functions show the\nsuperiority of our method over other state-of-the-art baselines. In general,\nour method obtains a higher performance in VCP, VCA, and Top-10 ACC measures of\nbetween 3\\% to 14\\% over the baselines when running on real-world datasets in\nan unsupervised setting.

By examining the workplace\npractices of the applied machine learning researchers who produce machine\nintelligence, those they work with, and the artifacts they produce. The\ndissertation begins by arguing that machine intelligence proceeds from a naive\nform of empiricism with ties to positivist intellectual traditions of the 17th\nand 18th centuries. This naive empiricism eschews other forms of knowledge and\ntheory formation in order for applied machine learning researchers to enact\ndata performances that bring objects of analysis into existence as entities\ncapable of being subjected to machine intelligence. By data performances, I\nmean generative enactments which bring into existence that which machine\nintelligence purports to analyze or describe. The enactment of data\nperformances is analyzed as an agential cut into a representational field that\nproduces both stable claims about the world and the interpretive frame in which\nthose claims can hold true.

    "abstract": "Despite significant progress over the past few years, ambiguity is still a\nkey challenge in Facial Expression Recognition (FER). It can lead to noisy and\ninconsistent annotation, which hinders the performance of deep learning models\nin real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a new uncertainty-aware\nlabel distribution learning method to improve the robustness of deep models\nagainst uncertainty and ambiguity. We leverage neighborhood information in the\nvalence-arousal space to adaptively construct emotion distributions for\ntraining samples. We also consider the uncertainty of provided labels when\nincorporating them into the label distributions. Our method can be easily\nintegrated into a deep network to obtain more training supervision and improve\nrecognition accuracy. Intensive experiments on several datasets under various\nnoisy and ambiguous settings show that our method achieves competitive results\nand outperforms recent state-of-the-art approaches.

    "abstract": "Deep learning based image quality assessment (IQA) models usually learn to\npredict image quality from a single dataset, leading the model to overfit\nspecific scenes. To account for this, mixed datasets training can be an\neffective way to enhance the generalization capability of the model. However,\nit is nontrivial to combine different IQA datasets, as their quality evaluation\ncriteria, score ranges, view conditions, as well as subjects are usually not\nshared during the image quality annotation. In this paper, instead of aligning\nthe annotations, we propose a monotonic neural network for IQA model learning\nwith different datasets combined. In particular, our model consists of a\ndataset-shared quality regressor and several dataset-specific quality\ntransformers. The quality regressor aims to obtain the perceptual qualities of\neach dataset while each quality transformer maps the perceptual qualities to\nthe corresponding dataset annotations with their monotonicity maintained. The\nexperimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed learning strategy\nand our code is available at https://github.com/fzp0424/MonotonicIQA.",

Prior work identified user engagement\nand dwell time as two key metrics of attention in digital environments, but\nthese metrics have yet to be integrated into a unified model that can advance\nthe theory andpractice of digital attention. We draw on work from cognitive\nscience, digital advertising, and AI to propose a two-stage model of attention\nfor social media environments that disentangles engagement and dwell. In an\nonline experiment, we show that attention operates differently in these two\nstages and find clear evidence of dissociation: when dwelling on posts (Stage\n1), users attend more to sensational than credible content, but when deciding\nwhether to engage with content (Stage 2), users attend more to credible than\nsensational content.

    "abstract": "Deep learning has led to great progress in the detection of mobile (i.e.\nmovement-capable) objects in urban driving scenes in recent years. Supervised\napproaches typically require the annotation of large training sets; there has\nthus been great interest in leveraging weakly, semi- or self-supervised methods\nto avoid this, with much success. Whilst weakly and semi-supervised methods\nrequire some annotation, self-supervised methods have used cues such as motion\nto relieve the need for annotation altogether. However, a complete absence of\nannotation typically degrades their performance, and ambiguities that arise\nduring motion grouping can inhibit their ability to find accurate object\nboundaries. In this paper, we propose a new self-supervised mobile object\ndetection approach called SCT. This uses both motion cues and expected object\nsizes to improve detection performance, and predicts a dense grid of 3D\noriented bounding boxes to improve object discovery.

In this work, we propose the novel task of captioning Wikipedia images\nby integrating contextual knowledge. Specifically, we produce models that\njointly reason over Wikipedia articles, Wikimedia images and their associated\ndescriptions to produce contextualized captions. Particularly, a similar\nWikimedia image can be used to illustrate different articles, and the produced\ncaption needs to be adapted to a specific context, therefore allowing us to\nexplore the limits of a model to adjust captions to different contextual\ninformation. A particular challenging task in this domain is dealing with\nout-of-dictionary words and Named Entities. To address this, we propose a\npre-training objective, Masked Named Entity Modeling (MNEM), and show that this\npretext task yields an improvement compared to baseline models. Furthermore, we\nverify that a model pre-trained with the MNEM objective in Wikipedia\ngeneralizes well to a News Captioning dataset.

By conducting a detailed meta-analysis of prior work,\nspanning 75 papers accepted for publication from 2016 to 2022, we bring to\nlight worrying trends that put into question the true rate of progress. We\nfurther consider these trends in a wider context and take inspiration from\nsingle-agent RL literature on similar issues with recommendations that remain\napplicable to MARL. Combining these recommendations, with novel insights from\nour analysis, we propose a standardised performance evaluation protocol for\ncooperative MARL. We argue that such a standard protocol, if widely adopted,\nwould greatly improve the validity and credibility of future research, make\nreplication and reproducibility easier, as well as improve the ability of the\nfield to accurately gauge the rate of progress over time by being able to make\nsound comparisons across different works.

However, achieving human-level performance when dealing with\nphysically interactive tasks, e.g., in contact-rich robotic manipulation, is\nstill a big challenge. It is well known that regulating the Cartesian impedance\nfor such operations is of utmost importance for their successful execution.\nApproaches like reinforcement Learning (RL) can be a promising paradigm for\nsolving such problems.

However, existing data\ncollection systems are expensive, complex, or do not allow for impedance\nregulation. This work represents a first step towards a data collection\nframework suitable for collecting large datasets of impedance-based expert\ndemonstrations compatible with the RL problem formulation, where a novel action\nspace is used.

This study is about exploring the\npotential usage of deep learning based image super-resolution algorithms on\nthermal data for producing high quality thermal imaging results for in-cabin\nvehicular driver monitoring systems. In this work we have proposed and\ndeveloped a novel multi-image super-resolution recurrent neural network to\nenhance the resolution and improve the quality of low-resolution thermal\nimaging data captured from uncooled thermal cameras. The end-to-end fully\nconvolutional neural network is trained from scratch on newly acquired thermal\ndata of 30 different subjects in indoor environmental conditions. The\neffectiveness of the thermally tuned super-resolution network is validated\nquantitatively as well as qualitatively on test data of 6 distinct subjects.\nThe network was able to achieve a mean peak signal to noise ratio of 39.24 on\nthe validation dataset for 4x super-resolution, outperforming bicubic\ninterpolation both quantitatively and qualitatively.",

    "title": "Unifying Classification Schemes for Software Engineering Meta-Research",
    "abstract": "Background: Classifications in meta-research enable researchers to cope with\nan increasing body of scientific knowledge. They provide a framework for, e.g.,\ndistinguishing methods, reports, reproducibility, and evaluation in a knowledge\nfield as well as a common terminology. Both eases sharing, understanding and\nevolution of knowledge. In software engineering (SE), there are several\nclassifications that describe the nature of SE research. Regarding the\nconsolidation of the large body of classified knowledge in SE research, a\ngenerally applicable classification scheme is crucial. Moreover, the\ncommonalities and differences among different classification schemes have\nrarely been studied. Due to the fact that classifications are documented\ntextual, it is hard to catalog, reuse, and compare them. To the best of our\nknowledge, there is no research work so far that addresses documentation and\nsystematic investigation of classifications in SE meta-research. Objective: We\naim to construct a unified, generally applicable classification scheme for SE\nmeta-research by collecting and documenting existing classification schemes and\nunifying their classes and categories. Method: Our execution plan is divided\ninto three phases: construction, validation, and evaluation phase. For the\nconstruction phase, we perform a literature review to identify, collect, and\nanalyze a set of established SE research classifications. In the validation\nphase, we analyze individual categories and classes of included papers. We use\nquantitative metrics from literature to conduct and assess the unification\nprocess to build a generally applicable classification scheme for SE research.\nLastly, we investigate the applicability of the unified scheme. Therefore, we\nperform a workshop session followed by user studies w.r.t. investigations about\nreliability, correctness, and ease of use.",

    "title": "Summarization Programs: Interpretable Abstractive Summarization with  Neural Modular Trees",
    "abstract": "Current abstractive summarization models either suffer from a lack of clear\ninterpretability or provide incomplete rationales by only highlighting parts of\nthe source document. To this end, we propose the Summarization Program (SP), an\ninterpretable modular framework consisting of an (ordered) list of binary\ntrees, each encoding the step-by-step generative process of an abstractive\nsummary sentence from the source document. A Summarization Program contains one\nroot node per summary sentence, and a distinct tree connects each summary\nsentence (root node) to the document sentences (leaf nodes) from which it is\nderived, with the connecting nodes containing intermediate generated sentences.\nEdges represent different modular operations involved in summarization such as\nsentence fusion, compression, and paraphrasing. We first propose an efficient\nbest-first search method over neural modules, SP-Search that identifies SPs for\nhuman summaries by directly optimizing for ROUGE scores. Next, using these\nprograms as automatic supervision, we propose seq2seq models that generate\nSummarization Programs, which are then executed to obtain final summaries. We\ndemonstrate that SP-Search effectively represents the generative process behind\nhuman summaries using modules that are typically faithful to their intended\nbehavior. We also conduct a simulation study to show that Summarization\nPrograms improve the interpretability of summarization models by allowing\nhumans to better simulate model reasoning. Summarization Programs constitute a\npromising step toward interpretable and modular abstractive summarization, a\ncomplex task previously addressed primarily through blackbox end-to-end neural\nsystems.

The\ntactile actuators are delivered to the fingertips of the user by a swarm of\ndrones. Users of DandelionTouch are capable of experiencing tactile feedback in\na large space that is not limited by the device's working area. Importantly,\nthey will not experience muscle fatigue during long interactions with virtual\nobjects. Hand tracking and swarm control algorithm allow guiding the swarm with\nhand motions and avoid collisions inside the formation.\nSeveral topologies of impedance connection between swarm units were\ninvestigated in this research. The experiment, in which drones performed a\npoint following task on a square trajectory in real-time, revealed that drones\nconnected in a Star topology performed the trajectory with low mean positional\nerror (RMSE decreased by 20.6\\% in comparison with other impedance topologies\nand by 40.9\\% in comparison with potential field-based swarm control). The\nachieved velocities of the drones in all formations with impedance behavior\nwere 28\\% higher than for the swarm controlled with the potential field\nalgorithm.\nAdditionally, the perception of several vibrotactile patterns was evaluated\nin a user study with 7 participants. The study has shown that the proposed\ncombination of temporal delay and frequency modulation allows users to\nsuccessfully recognize the surface property and motion direction in VR\nsimultaneously (mean recognition rate of 70\\%, maximum of 93\\%).

Recently, several neural alternatives have been\nproposed that reconstruct talking head videos at very low bitrates using sparse\nrepresentations of each frame such as facial landmark information. However,\nthese approaches produce poor reconstructions in scenarios with major movement\nor occlusions over the course of a call, and do not scale to higher\nresolutions.

    "abstract": "Given a portrait image of a person and an environment map of the target\nlighting, portrait relighting aims to re-illuminate the person in the image as\nif the person appeared in an environment with the target lighting. To achieve\nhigh-quality results, recent methods rely on deep learning. An effective\napproach is to supervise the training of deep neural networks with a\nhigh-fidelity dataset of desired input-output pairs, captured with a light\nstage. However, acquiring such data requires an expensive special capture rig\nand time-consuming efforts, limiting access to only a few resourceful\nlaboratories. To address the limitation, we propose a new approach that can\nperform on par with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) relighting methods without\nrequiring a light stage. Our approach is based on the realization that a\nsuccessful relighting of a portrait image depends on two conditions. First, the\nmethod needs to mimic the behaviors of physically-based relighting. Second, the\noutput has to be photorealistic. To meet the first condition, we propose to\ntrain the relighting network with training data generated by a virtual light\nstage that performs physically-based rendering on various 3D synthetic humans\nunder different environment maps. To meet the second condition, we develop a\nnovel synthetic-to-real approach to bring photorealism to the relighting\nnetwork output. In addition to achieving SOTA results, our approach offers\nseveral advantages over the prior methods, including controllable glares on\nglasses and more temporally-consistent results for relighting videos.",

    "abstract": "Clustered federated learning (FL) has been shown to produce promising results\nby grouping clients into clusters. This is especially effective in scenarios\nwhere separate groups of clients have significant differences in the\ndistributions of their local data. Existing clustered FL algorithms are\nessentially trying to group together clients with similar distributions so that\nclients in the same cluster can leverage each other's data to better perform\nfederated learning. However, prior clustered FL algorithms attempt to learn\nthese distribution similarities indirectly during training, which can be quite\ntime consuming as many rounds of federated learning may be required until the\nformation of clusters is stabilized. In this paper, we propose a new approach\nto federated learning that directly aims to efficiently identify distribution\nsimilarities among clients by analyzing the principal angles between the client\ndata subspaces. Each client applies a truncated singular value decomposition\n(SVD) step on its local data in a single-shot manner to derive a small set of\nprincipal vectors, which provides a signature that succinctly captures the main\ncharacteristics of the underlying distribution. This small set of principal\nvectors is provided to the server so that the server can directly identify\ndistribution similarities among the clients to form clusters. This is achieved\nby comparing the similarities of the principal angles between the client data\nsubspaces spanned by those principal vectors. The approach provides a simple,\nyet effective clustered FL framework that addresses a broad range of data\nheterogeneity issues beyond simpler forms of Non-IIDness like label skews. Our\nclustered FL approach also enables convergence guarantees for non-convex\nobjectives. Our code is available at https://github.com/MMorafah/PACFL.",

In this paper, we developed exact analysis and upper bounds on the\nperformance of RIS-assisted vehicular communication system considering phase\nnoise with mobility over asymmetric fading channels by coherently combining\nreceived signals reflected by RIS elements and direct transmissions from the\nsource terminal.

    "title": "Benchmarking and Analyzing 3D Human Pose and Shape Estimation Beyond  Algorithms",
    "abstract": "3D human pose and shape estimation (a.k.a. \"human mesh recovery\") has\nachieved substantial progress. Researchers mainly focus on the development of\nnovel algorithms, while less attention has been paid to other critical factors\ninvolved. This could lead to less optimal baselines, hindering the fair and\nfaithful evaluations of newly designed methodologies. To address this problem,\nthis work presents the first comprehensive benchmarking study from three\nunder-explored perspectives beyond algorithms. 1) Datasets. An analysis on 31\ndatasets reveals the distinct impacts of data samples: datasets featuring\ncritical attributes (i.e. diverse poses, shapes, camera characteristics,\nbackbone features) are more effective. Strategical selection and combination of\nhigh-quality datasets can yield a significant boost to the model performance.\n2) Backbones. Experiments with 10 backbones, ranging from CNNs to transformers,\nshow the knowledge learnt from a proximity task is readily transferable to\nhuman mesh recovery. 3) Training strategies. Proper augmentation techniques and\nloss designs are crucial. With the above findings, we achieve a PA-MPJPE of\n47.3 mm on the 3DPW test set with a relatively simple model. More importantly,\nwe provide strong baselines for fair comparisons of algorithms, and\nrecommendations for building effective training configurations in the future.\nCodebase is available at this http URL",

This theory improves upon the non-sparse case, where\nthe third-order autocorrelation is required for uniformly-oriented particle\nimages and the sample complexity scales with the cube of the noise variance.\nFurthermore, we build a computational framework to reconstruct molecular\nstructures which are sparse in the wavelet basis.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) seeks to distribute model training across local\nclients without collecting data in a centralized data-center, hence removing\ndata-privacy concerns. A major challenge for FL is data heterogeneity (where\neach client's data distribution can differ) as it can lead to weight divergence\namong local clients and slow global convergence. The current SOTA FL methods\ndesigned for data heterogeneity typically impose regularization to limit the\nimpact of non-IID data and are stateful algorithms, i.e., they maintain local\nstatistics over time. While effective, these approaches can only be used for a\nspecial case of FL involving only a small number of reliable clients. For the\nmore typical applications of FL where the number of clients is large (e.g.,\nedge-device and mobile applications), these methods cannot be applied,\nmotivating the need for a stateless approach to heterogeneous FL which can be\nused for any number of clients. We derive a first-order gradient regularization\nto penalize inconsistent local updates due to local data heterogeneity.\nSpecifically, to mitigate weight divergence, we introduce a first-order\napproximation of the global data distribution into local objectives, which\nintuitively penalizes updates in the opposite direction of the global update.\nThe end result is a stateless FL algorithm that achieves 1) significantly\nfaster convergence (i.e., fewer communication rounds) and 2) higher overall\nconverged performance than SOTA methods under non-IID data distribution.\nImportantly, our approach does not impose unrealistic limits on the client\nsize, enabling learning from a large number of clients as is typical in most FL\napplications.",

The purpose of creating Quantum\nCircuit Synthesizer \"Naginata\" was due to the fact that even with a slight\nincrease in the number of operations in a quantum algorithm, leads to the\nsignificant increase in size of the corresponding quantum circuit. This causes\nserious difficulties both in creating and debugging these quantum circuits. The\npurpose of our quantum synthesizer is enabling users an opportunity to\nimplement quantum algorithms using higher-level commands. This is achieved by\ncreating generic blocks for frequently used operations such as: the adder,\nmultiplier, digital comparator (comparison operator), etc. Thus, the user could\nimplement a quantum algorithm by using these generic blocks, and the quantum\nsynthesizer would create a suitable circuit for this algorithm, in a format\nthat is supported by the chosen quantum computation environment. This approach\ngreatly simplifies the processes of development and debugging a quantum\nalgorithm. The proposed approach for implementing quantum algorithms has a\npotential application in the field of machine learning, in this regard, we\nprovided an example of creating a circuit for training a simple neural network.\nNeural networks have a significant impact on the technological development of\nthe transport and road complex, and there is a potential for improving the\nreliability and efficiency of their learning process by utilizing quantum\ncomputation, through the introduction of quantum computing.",

    "abstract": "Data-driven models for nonlinear dynamical systems based on approximating the\nunderlying Koopman operator or generator have proven to be successful tools for\nforecasting, feature learning, state estimation, and control. It has become\nwell known that the Koopman generators for control-affine systems also have\naffine dependence on the input, leading to convenient finite-dimensional\nbilinear approximations of the dynamics. Yet there are still two main obstacles\nthat limit the scope of current approaches for approximating the Koopman\ngenerators of systems with actuation. First, the performance of existing\nmethods depends heavily on the choice of basis functions over which the Koopman\ngenerator is to be approximated; and there is currently no universal way to\nchoose them for systems that are not measure preserving. Secondly, if we do not\nobserve the full state, we may not gain access to a sufficiently rich\ncollection of such functions to describe the dynamics. This is because the\ncommonly used method of forming time-delayed observables fails when there is\nactuation. To remedy these issues, we write the dynamics of observables\ngoverned by the Koopman generator as a bilinear hidden Markov model, and\ndetermine the model parameters using the expectation-maximization (EM)\nalgorithm. The E-step involves a standard Kalman filter and smoother, while the\nM-step resembles control-affine dynamic mode decomposition for the generator.\nWe demonstrate the performance of this method on three examples, including\nrecovery of a finite-dimensional Koopman-invariant subspace for an actuated\nsystem with a slow manifold; estimation of Koopman eigenfunctions for the\nunforced Duffing equation; and model-predictive control of a fluidic pinball\nsystem based only on noisy observations of lift and drag.",

We also study the effect of ambient illumination on perceptual\nquality of HDR videos by conducting the study in both a dark lab environment\nand a brighter living-room environment. A total of 66 subjects participated in\nthe study and more than 20,000 opinion scores were collected, which makes this\nthe largest in-lab study of HDR video quality ever. We anticipate that the\ndataset will be a valuable resource for researchers to develop better models of\nperceptual quality for HDR videos.",

This work starts\nwith the simple observation that, given a strongly contracting system on a\nnormed space, its adjoint dynamical system is also strongly contracting, with\nthe same rate, with respect to the dual norm, under time reversal. As main\nimplication of this dual contractivity, we show that the classic Method of\nSuccessive Approximations (MSA), an indirect method in optimal control, is a\ncontraction mapping for short optimization intervals or large contraction\nrates.

The reservoir device has a 1-input\nexciter and 120-output detectors on the top of a continuous magnetic garnet\nfilm for spin-wave transmission. For various nonlinear and fading-memory\ndynamic phenomena distributing in the film space, small in-plane magnetic\nfields were used to prepare stripe domain structures and various damping\nconstants at the film sides and bottom were explored. The ferromagnetic\nresonant frequency and relaxation time of spin precession clearly characterized\nthe change in spin dynamics with the magnetic field and damping constant. The\ncommon input signal for reservoir computing was a 1 GHz cosine wave with random\n6-valued amplitude modulation. A basic 120-dimensional reservoir output vector\nwas obtained from time-series signals at the 120 output detectors under each of\nthe three magnetic field conditions. Then, 240- and 360-dimensional reservoir\noutput vectors were also constructed by concatenating two and three basic ones,\nrespectively. In nonlinear autoregressive moving average (NARMA) prediction\ntasks, the computational performance was enhanced as the dimension of the\nreservoir output vector becomes higher and a significantly low prediction error\nwas achieved for the 10th-order NARMA using the 360-dimensional vector and\noptimum damping constant. The results are clear evidence that the collection of\ndiverse output signals efficiently increases the dimensionality effective for\nreservoir computing, i.e., reservoir-state richness.

These OWFs are often thought\nof as having classical input and output (i.e. binary strings), however, recent\nwork proposes OWF constructions where the input and/or the output can be\nquantum. In this paper, we demonstrate that quantum-classical (i.e. quantum\ninput, classical output) OWFs can be used to produce classical-classical (i.e.\nclassical input, classical output) OWFs that retain the one-wayness property\nagainst any quantum polynomial adversary (i.e. quantum-resistant). We\ndemonstrate this in two ways. Firstly, we propose a definition of\nquantum-classical OWFs and show that the existence of such a quantum-classical\nOWF would imply the existence of a classical-classical OWF. Secondly, we take a\nproposed quantum-classical OWF and demonstrate how to turn it into a\nclassical-classical OWF. In summary, this paper showcases another possible\nroute into proving the existence of classical-classical OWFs (assuming\nintermediate quantum computations are allowed) using a \"domain-shifting\"\ntechnique between classical and quantum information, with the added bonus that\nsuch OWFs are also going to be quantum-resistant.",

This innovative representation\nof polynomials has a wide range of applications in quantum computation. When\nthe polynomial of interest is obtained by truncating an infinite polynomial\nseries, a natural question is whether the phase factors have a well defined\nlimit as the degree $d\\to \\infty$. While the phase factors are generally not\nunique, we find that there exists a consistent choice of parameterization so\nthat the limit is well defined in the $\\ell^1$ space.

Our analysis reveals a surprising\nconnection between the regularity of the target function and the decay\nproperties of the phase factors. Our analysis also inspires a very simple and\nefficient algorithm to approximately compute the phase factors in the $\\ell^1$\nspace. The algorithm uses only double precision arithmetic operations, and\nprovably converges when the $\\ell^1$ norm of the Chebyshev coefficients of the\ntarget function is upper bounded by a constant that is independent of $d$.

    "abstract": "Medical image classification has developed rapidly under the impetus of the\nconvolutional neural network (CNN). Due to the fixed size of the receptive\nfield of the convolution kernel, it is difficult to capture the global features\nof medical images. Although the self-attention-based Transformer can model\nlong-range dependencies, it has high computational complexity and lacks local\ninductive bias. Much research has demonstrated that global and local features\nare crucial for image classification. However, medical images have a lot of\nnoisy, scattered features, intra-class variation, and inter-class similarities.\nThis paper proposes a three-branch hierarchical multi-scale feature fusion\nnetwork structure termed as HiFuse for medical image classification as a new\nmethod. It can fuse the advantages of Transformer and CNN from multi-scale\nhierarchies without destroying the respective modeling so as to improve the\nclassification accuracy of various medical images. A parallel hierarchy of\nlocal and global feature blocks is designed to efficiently extract local\nfeatures and global representations at various semantic scales, with the\nflexibility to model at different scales and linear computational complexity\nrelevant to image size. Moreover, an adaptive hierarchical feature fusion block\n(HFF block) is designed to utilize the features obtained at different\nhierarchical levels comprehensively. The HFF block contains spatial attention,\nchannel attention, residual inverted MLP, and shortcut to adaptively fuse\nsemantic information between various scale features of each branch. The\naccuracy of our proposed model on the ISIC2018 dataset is 7.6% higher than\nbaseline, 21.5% on the Covid-19 dataset, and 10.4% on the Kvasir dataset.\nCompared with other advanced models, the HiFuse model performs the best.

    "abstract": "This work concerns with boundary conditions (BCs) of the linearized moment\nsystem for rarefied gases. As the Knudsen number is sufficiently small, we\nanalyze the boundary-layer behaviors of the moment system by resorting to a\nthree-scale asymptotic expansion. The asymptotic analysis casts the flows into\nthe outer solution, the viscous layer and the Knudsen layer. Starting from the\nBCs of the moment system, we propose a matching requirement and construct BCs\nfor the Navier-Stokes equations. The obtained BCs contain the effect of\nsecond-order terms on the velocity slip and temperature jump. For the\nillustrative case of the Couette flow, we prove the validity of the constructed\nBCs through the error estimates. Meanwhile, numerical tests are presented to\nshow the performance of the constructed BCs.",

Prerequisites for a wide-spread application are an\neasy-to-use workflow for generating training datasets in a reasonable time, and\nthe capability of the network to generalize to unseen systems. In contrast to\nmost previous works where training systems are similar to the evaluation\ndataset, we propose to adapt the type of training system to the network\narchitecture. Specifically, we apply a fully convolutional network and, thus,\ndesign 3D systems of randomly located voxels with randomly assigned physical\nproperties. The idea is tested for the transient heat diffusion in electronic\nsystems.

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) has attracted appealing\nattention in academic researches and clinical applications. Nevertheless, the\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) diagnosis system heavily relies on the\nwell-labeled lesion dataset, and the sensitivity to the variation of data\ndistribution also restricts the potential application of CNNs in CAD.\nUnsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods are developed to solve the\nexpensive annotation and domain gaps problem and have achieved remarkable\nsuccess in medical image analysis. Yet existing UDA approaches only adapt\nknowledge learned from the source lesion domain to a single target lesion\ndomain, which is against the clinical scenario: the new unlabeled target\ndomains to be diagnosed always arrive in an online and continual manner.\nMoreover, the performance of existing approaches degrades dramatically on\npreviously learned target lesion domains, due to the newly learned knowledge\noverwriting the previously learned knowledge (i.e., catastrophic forgetting).\nTo deal with the above issues, we develop a meta-adaptation framework named\nConsecutive Lesion Knowledge Meta-Adaptation (CLKM), which mainly consists of\nSemantic Adaptation Phase (SAP) and Representation Adaptation Phase (RAP) to\nlearn the diagnosis model in an online and continual manner. In the SAP, the\nsemantic knowledge learned from the source lesion domain is transferred to\nconsecutive target lesion domains. In the RAP, the feature-extractor is\noptimized to align the transferable representation knowledge across the source\nand multiple target lesion domains.",

Suitable models can be used to randomize an\nobserved network while preserving some of its features, or to generate\nsynthetic graphs whose properties may be tuned upon the characteristics of a\ngiven population. In the present paper, we introduce the Fitness-Corrected\nBlock Model, an adjustable-density variation of the well-known Degree-Corrected\nBlock Model, and we show that the proposed construction yields a maximum\nentropy model. When the network is sparse, we derive an analytical expression\nfor the degree distribution of the model that depends on just the constraints\nand the chosen fitness-distribution. Our model is perfectly suited to define\nmaximum-entropy data-driven spatial social networks, where each block\nidentifies vertices having similar position (e.g., residence) and age, and\nwhere the expected block-to-block adjacency matrix can be inferred from the\navailable data. In this case, the sparse-regime approximation coincides with a\nphenomenological model where the probability of a link binding two individuals\nis directly proportional to their sociability and to the typical cohesion of\ntheir age-groups, whereas it decays as an inverse-power of their geographic\ndistance.

This study investigated the performance of\nreinforcement learning (RL) when applied to portfolio management using\nmodel-free deep RL agents. We trained several RL agents on real-world stock\nprices to learn how to perform asset allocation. We compared the performance of\nthese RL agents against some baseline agents. We also compared the RL agents\namong themselves to understand which classes of agents performed better. From\nour analysis, RL agents can perform the task of portfolio management since they\nsignificantly outperformed two of the baseline agents (random allocation and\nuniform allocation). Four RL agents (A2C, SAC, PPO, and TRPO) outperformed the\nbest baseline, MPT, overall. This shows the abilities of RL agents to uncover\nmore profitable trading strategies. Furthermore, there were no significant\nperformance differences between value-based and policy-based RL agents.\nActor-critic agents performed better than other types of agents. Also,\non-policy agents performed better than off-policy agents because they are\nbetter at policy evaluation and sample efficiency is not a significant problem\nin portfolio management.

In particular,\nthis contextual information can be very useful in demand forecasting with large\ndemand volatility or intermittent demand patterns. Convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) have been successfully used in many fields where important\ninformation in data is represented by images. CNNs are powerful because they\naccept samples as images and use adjacent voxel sets to integrate\nmulti-dimensional important information and learn important features. On the\nother hand, although the demand-forecasting model has been improved, the input\ndata is still limited in its tabular form and is not suitable for CNN modeling.\nIn this study, we propose a Tab2vox neural architecture search (NAS) model as a\nmethod to convert a high-dimensional tabular sam-ple into a well-formed 3D\nvoxel image and use it in a 3D CNN network. For each image repre-sentation, the\n3D CNN forecasting model proposed from the Tab2vox framework showed supe-rior\nperformance, compared to the existing time series and machine learning\ntechniques using tabular data, and the latest image transformation studies.",
