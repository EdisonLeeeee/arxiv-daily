    "title": "Non-Imaging Medical Data Synthesis for Trustworthy AI: A Comprehensive  Survey",
    "abstract": "Data quality is the key factor for the development of trustworthy AI in\nhealthcare. A large volume of curated datasets with controlled confounding\nfactors can help improve the accuracy, robustness and privacy of downstream AI\nalgorithms. However, access to good quality datasets is limited by the\ntechnical difficulty of data acquisition and large-scale sharing of healthcare\ndata is hindered by strict ethical restrictions. Data synthesis algorithms,\nwhich generate data with a similar distribution as real clinical data, can\nserve as a potential solution to address the scarcity of good quality data\nduring the development of trustworthy AI. However, state-of-the-art data\nsynthesis algorithms, especially deep learning algorithms, focus more on\nimaging data while neglecting the synthesis of non-imaging healthcare data,\nincluding clinical measurements, medical signals and waveforms, and electronic\nhealthcare records (EHRs). Thus, in this paper, we will review the synthesis\nalgorithms, particularly for non-imaging medical data, with the aim of\nproviding trustworthy AI in this domain. This tutorial-styled review paper will\nprovide comprehensive descriptions of non-imaging medical data synthesis on\naspects including algorithms, evaluations, limitations and future research\ndirections.",

    "title": "Distributed Semi-supervised Fuzzy Regression with Interpolation  Consistency Regularization",
    "abstract": "Recently, distributed semi-supervised learning (DSSL) algorithms have shown\ntheir effectiveness in leveraging unlabeled samples over interconnected\nnetworks, where agents cannot share their original data with each other and can\nonly communicate non-sensitive information with their neighbors. However,\nexisting DSSL algorithms cannot cope with data uncertainties and may suffer\nfrom high computation and communication overhead problems. To handle these\nissues, we propose a distributed semi-supervised fuzzy regression (DSFR) model\nwith fuzzy if-then rules and interpolation consistency regularization (ICR).\nThe ICR, which was proposed recently for semi-supervised problem, can force\ndecision boundaries to pass through sparse data areas, thus increasing model\nrobustness. However, its application in distributed scenarios has not been\nconsidered yet. In this work, we proposed a distributed Fuzzy C-means (DFCM)\nmethod and a distributed interpolation consistency regularization (DICR) built\non the well-known alternating direction method of multipliers to respectively\nlocate parameters in antecedent and consequent components of DSFR. Notably, the\nDSFR model converges very fast since it does not involve back-propagation\nprocedure and is scalable to large-scale datasets benefiting from the\nutilization of DFCM and DICR. Experiments results on both artificial and\nreal-world datasets show that the proposed DSFR model can achieve much better\nperformance than the state-of-the-art DSSL algorithm in terms of both loss\nvalue and computational cost.",

To ensure\nso, at least a certain degree of interoperability should be guaranteed across\ndata sources, so that data could be better aggregated and complemented and that\nevidence provided towards policy-making is more complete and reliable.

In process\ncontrol, many systems have similar and well-understood dynamics, which suggests\nit is feasible to create a generalizable controller through meta-learning. In\nthis work, we formulate a meta reinforcement learning (meta-RL) control\nstrategy that takes advantage of known, offline information for training, such\nas a model structure. The meta-RL agent is trained over a distribution of model\nparameters, rather than a single model, enabling the agent to automatically\nadapt to changes in the process dynamics while maintaining performance.

The nth wave number\n${\\bf u}_n$ is the countable sequence of the nth roots of unity having\nfrequencies k/n for all integer phases k. The space U is closed under a\ncommutative and associative binary operation ${\\bf u}_m \\odot{\\bf u}_n={\\bf\nu}_{mn}$, termed the circular product, and is isomorphic with N under their\nrespective product operators. Functions are defined on U that partition wave\nnumbers into two complementary sequences, of which the co-number $ {\\overset\n{\\bf \\ast }{ \\bf u}}_n$ is a function of a wave number in which zeros replace\nits positive roots of unity. The recursive procedure $ {\\overset {\\bf \\ast }{\n\\bf U}}_{N+1}= {\\overset {\\bf \\ast }{ \\bf U}}_{N}\\odot{\\overset {\\bf \\ast }{\\bf\nu}}_{{N+1}}$ represents prime numbers explicitly in terms of preceding prime\nnumbers, starting with $p_1=2$, and is shown never to terminate.

    "abstract": "Reachability analysis is a formal method to guarantee safety of dynamical\nsystems under the influence of uncertainties. A major bottleneck of all\nreachability algorithms is the requirement to adequately tune certain algorithm\nparameters such as the time step size, which requires expert knowledge. In this\nwork, we solve this issue with a fully-automated reachability algorithm that\ntunes all algorithm parameters internally such that the reachable set enclosure\nsatisfies a user-defined accuracy in terms of distance to the exact reachable\nset. Knowing the distance to the exact reachable set, an inner-approximation of\nthe reachable set can be efficiently extracted from the outer-approximation\nusing the Minkowski difference. Finally, we propose a novel verification\nalgorithm that automatically refines the accuracy of the outer- and\ninner-approximation until specifications given by time-varying safe and unsafe\nsets can either be verified or falsified. The numerical evaluation demonstrates\nthat our verification algorithm successfully verifies or falsifies benchmarks\nfrom different domains without any requirement for manual tuning.",

    "abstract": "Social media provide a fertile ground where conspiracy theories and radical\nideas can flourish, reach broad audiences, and sometimes lead to hate or\nviolence beyond the online world itself. QAnon represents a notable example of\na political conspiracy that started out on social media but turned mainstream,\nin part due to public endorsement by influential political figures. Nowadays,\nQAnon conspiracies often appear in the news, are part of political rhetoric,\nand are espoused by significant swaths of people in the United States. It is\ntherefore crucial to understand how such a conspiracy took root online, and\nwhat led so many social media users to adopt its ideas. In this work, we\npropose a framework that exploits both social interaction and content signals\nto uncover evidence of user radicalization or support for QAnon. Leveraging a\nlarge dataset of 240M tweets collected in the run-up to the 2020 US\nPresidential election, we define and validate a multivariate metric of\nradicalization. We use that to separate users in distinct, naturally-emerging,\nclasses of behaviors associated to radicalization processes, from self-declared\nQAnon supporters to hyper-active conspiracy promoters. We also analyze the\nimpact of Twitter's moderation policies on the interactions among different\nclasses: we discover aspects of moderation that succeed, yielding a substantial\nreduction in the endorsement received by hyper-active QAnon accounts. But we\nalso uncover where moderation fails, showing how QAnon content amplifiers are\nnot deterred or affected by Twitter intervention. Our findings refine our\nunderstanding of online radicalization processes, reveal effective and\nineffective aspects of moderation, and call for the need to further investigate\nthe role social media play in the spread of conspiracies.",

This intermediate domain is\nconsidered as privileged information (PI) that is unavailable at test time, and\nallows formulating this cross-modal matching task as a problem in learning\nunder privileged information (LUPI). We devised a new method to generate images\nbetween visible and infrared domains that provide additional information to\ntrain a deep ReID model through an intermediate domain adaptation. In\nparticular, by employing color-free and multi-step triplet loss objectives\nduring training, our method provides common feature representation spaces that\nare robust to large visible-infrared domain shifts. % Experimental results on\nchallenging visible-infrared ReID datasets indicate that our proposed approach\nconsistently improves matching accuracy, without any computational overhead at\ntest time.

Also, its modular design enables multiple shape\nconfigurations and easy swapping of soft actuators. As a first step to\nexploring machine learning control algorithms on this system, two deep neural\nnetwork models were developed, trained, and evaluated to estimate the robot's\nforward and inverse kinematics. The techniques developed for controlling this\nunderwater soft robotic arm can help advance understanding on how to control\nsoft robotic systems in general.",

    "abstract": "Video frame interpolation (VFI) is a fundamental vision task that aims to\nsynthesize several frames between two consecutive original video images. Most\nalgorithms aim to accomplish VFI by using only keyframes, which is an ill-posed\nproblem since the keyframes usually do not yield any accurate precision about\nthe trajectories of the objects in the scene. On the other hand, event-based\ncameras provide more precise information between the keyframes of a video. Some\nrecent state-of-the-art event-based methods approach this problem by utilizing\nevent data for better optical flow estimation to interpolate for video frame by\nwarping. Nonetheless, those methods heavily suffer from the ghosting effect. On\nthe other hand, some of kernel-based VFI methods that only use frames as input,\nhave shown that deformable convolutions, when backed up with transformers, can\nbe a reliable way of dealing with long-range dependencies. We propose\nevent-based video frame interpolation with attention (E-VFIA), as a lightweight\nkernel-based method. E-VFIA fuses event information with standard video frames\nby deformable convolutions to generate high quality interpolated frames. The\nproposed method represents events with high temporal resolution and uses a\nmulti-head self-attention mechanism to better encode event-based information,\nwhile being less vulnerable to blurring and ghosting artifacts; thus,\ngenerating crispier frames. The simulation results show that the proposed\ntechnique outperforms current state-of-the-art methods (both frame and\nevent-based) with a significantly smaller model size.",

    "abstract": "LiDAR-based 3D object detection, semantic segmentation, and panoptic\nsegmentation are usually implemented in specialized networks with distinctive\narchitectures that are difficult to adapt to each other. This paper presents\nLidarMultiNet, a LiDAR-based multi-task network that unifies these three major\nLiDAR perception tasks. Among its many benefits, a multi-task network can\nreduce the overall cost by sharing weights and computation among multiple\ntasks. However, it typically underperforms compared to independently combined\nsingle-task models. The proposed LidarMultiNet aims to bridge the performance\ngap between the multi-task network and multiple single-task networks. At the\ncore of LidarMultiNet is a strong 3D voxel-based encoder-decoder architecture\nwith a Global Context Pooling (GCP) module extracting global contextual\nfeatures from a LiDAR frame. Task-specific heads are added on top of the\nnetwork to perform the three LiDAR perception tasks. More tasks can be\nimplemented simply by adding new task-specific heads while introducing little\nadditional cost. A second stage is also proposed to refine the first-stage\nsegmentation and generate accurate panoptic segmentation results. LidarMultiNet\nis extensively tested on both Waymo Open Dataset and nuScenes dataset,\ndemonstrating for the first time that major LiDAR perception tasks can be\nunified in a single strong network that is trained end-to-end and achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance.

To tackle the challenge, we propose AutoSeq, a fully\nautomatic prompting method: (1) We adopt natural language prompts on\nsequence-to-sequence models, enabling free-form generation and larger label\nsearch space; (2) We propose label sequences -- phrases with indefinite lengths\nto verbalize the labels -- which eliminate the need of manual templates and are\nmore expressive than single label words; (3) We use beam search to\nautomatically generate a large amount of label sequence candidates and propose\ncontrastive re-ranking to get the best combinations.

In this\npaper, we propose a novel weak disambiguation for partial structured output\nlearning (WD-PSL). First, a piecewise large margin formulation is generalized\nto partial structured output learning, which effectively avoids handling large\nnumber of candidate structured outputs for complex structures. Second, in the\nproposed weak disambiguation strategy, each candidate label is assigned with a\nconfidence value indicating how likely it is the true label, which aims to\nreduce the negative effects of wrong ground-truth label assignment in the\nlearning process. Then two large margins are formulated to combine two types of\nconstraints which are the disambiguation between candidates and non-candidates,\nand the weak disambiguation for candidates.

In many real-world applications, such as robotic applications,\nselecting an arm corresponds to a physical action that constrains the choices\nof the next available arms (actions). Motivated by this, we study an extension\nof MAB called the graph bandit, where an agent travels over a graph trying to\nmaximize the reward collected from different nodes. The graph defines the\nfreedom of the agent in selecting the next available nodes at each step. We\nassume the graph structure is fully available, but the reward distributions are\nunknown.

While\nthese two desiderata seem related, the connection between them is often unclear\nin practice. Here, we discuss these connections through a causal lens, focusing\non anti-causal prediction tasks, where the input to a classifier (e.g., an\nimage) is assumed to be generated as a function of the target label and the\nprotected attribute. By taking this perspective, we draw explicit connections\nbetween a common fairness criterion - separation - and a common notion of\nrobustness - risk invariance. These connections provide new motivation for\napplying the separation criterion in anticausal settings, and inform old\ndiscussions regarding fairness-performance tradeoffs. In addition, our findings\nsuggest that robustness-motivated approaches can be used to enforce separation,\nand that they often work better in practice than methods designed to directly\nenforce separation. Using a medical dataset, we empirically validate our\nfindings on the task of detecting pneumonia from X-rays, in a setting where\ndifferences in prevalence across sex groups motivates a fairness mitigation.\nOur findings highlight the importance of considering causal structure when\nchoosing and enforcing fairness criteria.",

Two orthogonal research trends have attracted enormous interests\nin addressing the energy efficiency in secure deep learning, i.e., overhead\nreduction of MPC comparison protocol, and hardware acceleration.

The current trend for this task involves training\na Transformer-based sentence encoder through a contrastive objective with text,\ni.e., clustering sentences with semantically similar meanings and scattering\nothers. In this work, we find the performance of Transformer models as sentence\nencoders can be improved by training with multi-modal multi-task losses, using\nunpaired examples from another modality (e.g., sentences and unrelated\nimage/audio data). In particular, besides learning by the contrastive loss on\ntext, our model clusters examples from a non-linguistic domain (e.g.,\nvisual/audio) with a similar contrastive loss at the same time. The reliance of\nour framework on unpaired non-linguistic data makes it language-agnostic,\nenabling it to be widely applicable beyond English NLP. Experiments on 7\nsemantic textual similarity benchmarks reveal that models trained with the\nadditional non-linguistic (images/audio) contrastive objective lead to higher\nquality sentence embeddings.

Experiments on TPU-like\naccelerator indicate that BP-im2col reduces the backpropagation runtime by\n34.9% on average, and reduces the bandwidth of off-chip memory and on-chip\nbuffers by at least 22.7% and 70.6% respectively, over a baseline accelerator\nadopting the traditional im2col.

    "abstract": "The success of Reinforcement Learning (RL) heavily relies on the ability to\nlearn robust representations from the observations of the environment. In most\ncases, the representations learned purely by the reinforcement learning loss\ncan differ vastly across states depending on how the value functions change.\nHowever, the representations learned need not be very specific to the task at\nhand. Relying only on the RL objective may yield representations that vary\ngreatly across successive time steps. In addition, since the RL loss has a\nchanging target, the representations learned would depend on how good the\ncurrent values/policies are. Thus, disentangling the representations from the\nmain task would allow them to focus more on capturing transition dynamics which\ncan improve generalization. To this end, we propose locally constrained\nrepresentations, where an auxiliary loss forces the state representations to be\npredictable by the representations of the neighbouring states. This encourages\nthe representations to be driven not only by the value/policy learning but also\nself-supervised learning, which constrains the representations from changing\ntoo rapidly. We evaluate the proposed method on several known benchmarks and\nobserve strong performance.

Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms that rely on extensive\nexploration of the state and action space can be used to optimize a control\npolicy. However, fully exploratory RL algorithms may decrease performance below\na baseline level during training. In this paper, we address the issue of online\noptimization of a control policy while minimizing regret w.r.t a baseline\npolicy performance. We present a joint imitation-reinforcement learning\nframework, denoted JIRL. The learning process in JIRL assumes the availability\nof a baseline policy and is designed with two objectives in mind \\textbf{(a)}\nleveraging the baseline's online demonstrations to minimize the regret w.r.t\nthe baseline policy during training, and \\textbf{(b)} eventually surpassing the\nbaseline performance. JIRL addresses these objectives by initially learning to\nimitate the baseline policy and gradually shifting control from the baseline to\nan RL agent. Experimental results show that JIRL effectively accomplishes the\naforementioned objectives in several, continuous action-space domains. The\nresults demonstrate that JIRL is comparable to a state-of-the-art algorithm in\nits final performance while incurring significantly lower baseline regret\nduring training in all of the presented domains. Moreover, the results show a\nreduction factor of up to $21$ in baseline regret over a state-of-the-art\nbaseline regret minimization approach.",

Hence, for predictive pandemic\nmonitoring, it is essential to explore latent heterogeneous features in cities\nand communities that distinguish their specific pandemic spread trajectories.\nTo this end, this study creates a network embedding model capturing\ncross-county visitation networks, as well as heterogeneous features to uncover\nclusters of counties in the United States based on their pandemic spread\ntransmission trajectories. We collected and computed location intelligence\nfeatures from 2,787 counties from March 3 to June 29, 2020 (initial wave).\nSecond, we constructed a human visitation network, which incorporated county\nfeatures as node attributes, and visits between counties as network edges. Our\nattributed network embeddings approach integrates both typological\ncharacteristics of the cross-county visitation network, as well as\nheterogeneous features. We conducted clustering analysis on the attributed\nnetwork embeddings to reveal four archetypes of spread risk trajectories\ncorresponding to four clusters of counties. Subsequently, we identified four\nfeatures as important features underlying the distinctive transmission risk\npatterns among the archetypes. The attributed network embedding approach and\nthe findings identify and explain the non-homogenous pandemic risk trajectories\nacross counties for predictive pandemic monitoring.

    "abstract": "Many universities have courses and projects revolving around compiler or\ninterpreter implementation as part of their degree programmes in computer\nscience. In such teaching activities, tool support can be highly beneficial.\nWhile there are already several tools for assisting with development of the\nfront end of compilers, tool support tapers off towards the back end, or\nrequires more background experience than is expected of undergraduate students.\nStructural operational semantics is a useful and mathematically simple\nformalism for specifying the behaviour of programs and a specification lends\nitself well to implementation; in particular big-step or natural semantics is\noften a useful and simple approach. However, many students struggle with\nlearning the notation and often come up with ill-defined and meaningless\nattempts at defining a structural operational semantics. A survey shows that\nstudents working on programming language projects feel that tool support is\nlacking and would be useful.\nMany of these problems encountered when developing a semantic definition are\nsimilar to problems encountered in programming, in particular ones that are\nessentially the result of type errors.\nWe present a pedagogical metalanguage based on natural semantics, and its\nimplementation, as an attempt to marry two notions: a syntax similar to\ntextbook notation for natural semantics on the one hand, and automatic\nverification of some correctness properties on the other by means of a strong\ntype discipline. The metalanguage and the tool provide the facilities for\nwriting and executing specifications as a form of programming. The user can\ncheck that the specification is not meaningless as well as execute programs, if\nthe specification makes sense.",

    "abstract": "Maintaining data consistency among multiple parties requires nodes to\nrepeatedly send data to all other nodes. For example, the nodes of a blockchain\nnetwork have to disseminate the blocks they create across the whole network.\nThe scientific literature typically takes the ideal perspective that such data\ndistribution is performed by broadcasting to all nodes directly, while in\npractice data is distributed by repeated multicast. Since correctness and\nsecurity of consistency maintenance protocols usually have been established for\nthe ideal setting only, it is vital to show that these properties carry over to\nreal-world implementations. Therefore, it is desirable to prove that the ideal\nand the real behavior are equivalent.\nIn the work described in this paper, we take an important step towards such a\nproof by proving a simpler variant of this equivalence statement. The\nsimplification is that we consider only a concrete pair of network topologies,\nwhich nevertheless illustrates important phenomena encountered with arbitrary\ntopologies. For describing systems that distribute data, we use a\ndomain-specific language of processes that corresponds to a class of Petri nets\nand is embedded in a general-purpose process calculus. This way, we can outline\nour proof using an intuitive graphical notation and leverage the rich theory of\nprocess calculi in the actual proof, which is machine-checked using the\nIsabelle proof assistant.",

    "abstract": "Multi-agent systems for resource allocation (MRAs) have been introduced as a\nconcept for modelling competitive resource allocation problems in distributed\ncomputing. An MRA is composed of a set of agents and a set of resources. Each\nagent has goals in terms of allocating certain resources. For MRAs it is\ntypically of importance that they are designed in a way such that there exists\na strategy that guarantees that all agents will achieve their goals. The\ncorresponding model checking problem is to determine whether such a winning\nstrategy exists or not, and the synthesis problem is to actually build the\nstrategy. While winning strategies ensure that all goals will be achieved,\nfollowing such strategies does not necessarily involve an optimal use of\nresources.\nIn this paper, we present a technique that allows to synthesise cost-optimal\nsolutions to distributed resource allocation problems. We consider a scenario\nwhere system components such as agents and resources involve costs. A\nmulti-agent system shall be designed that is cost-minimal but still capable of\naccomplishing a given set of goals. Our approach synthesises a winning strategy\nthat minimises the cumulative costs of the components that are required for\nachieving the goals. The technique is based on a propositional logic encoding\nand a reduction of the synthesis problem to the maximum satisfiability problem\n(Max-SAT). Hence, a Max-SAT solver can be used to perform the synthesis. From a\ntruth assignment that maximises the number of satisfied clauses of the encoding\na cost-optimal winning strategy as well as a cost-optimal system can be\nimmediately derived.",

Unfortunately, HR images and\ntheir pixel-level annotations are certainly more labor-intensive and\ntime-consuming compared to low-resolution (LR) images and annotations.\nTherefore, we propose an image pyramid-based SOD framework, Inverse Saliency\nPyramid Reconstruction Network (InSPyReNet), for HR prediction without any of\nHR datasets. We design InSPyReNet to produce a strict image pyramid structure\nof saliency map, which enables to ensemble multiple results with pyramid-based\nimage blending. For HR prediction, we design a pyramid blending method which\nsynthesizes two different image pyramids from a pair of LR and HR scale from\nthe same image to overcome effective receptive field (ERF) discrepancy. Our\nextensive evaluations on public LR and HR SOD benchmarks demonstrate that\nInSPyReNet surpasses the State-of-the-Art (SotA) methods on various SOD metrics\nand boundary accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Existing work in continual learning (CL) focuses on mitigating catastrophic\nforgetting, i.e., model performance deterioration on past tasks when learning a\nnew task. However, the training efficiency of a CL system is\nunder-investigated, which limits the real-world application of CL systems under\nresource-limited scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel framework called\nSparse Continual Learning(SparCL), which is the first study that leverages\nsparsity to enable cost-effective continual learning on edge devices. SparCL\nachieves both training acceleration and accuracy preservation through the\nsynergy of three aspects: weight sparsity, data efficiency, and gradient\nsparsity. Specifically, we propose task-aware dynamic masking (TDM) to learn a\nsparse network throughout the entire CL process, dynamic data removal (DDR) to\nremove less informative training data, and dynamic gradient masking (DGM) to\nsparsify the gradient updates. Each of them not only improves efficiency, but\nalso further mitigates catastrophic forgetting. SparCL consistently improves\nthe training efficiency of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) CL methods by at\nmost 23X less training FLOPs, and, surprisingly, further improves the SOTA\naccuracy by at most 1.7%. SparCL also outperforms competitive baselines\nobtained from adapting SOTA sparse training methods to the CL setting in both\nefficiency and accuracy. We also evaluate the effectiveness of SparCL on a real\nmobile phone, further indicating the practical potential of our method.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, the design and analysis of high order accurate IMEX finite\nvolume schemes for the compressible Euler-Poisson (EP) equations in the\nquasineutral limit is presented. As the quasineutral limit is singular for the\ngoverning equations, the time discretisation is tantamount to achieving an\naccurate numerical method. To this end, the EP system is viewed as a\ndifferential algebraic equation system (DAEs) via the method of lines. As a\nconsequence of this vantage point, high order linearly semi-implicit (SI) time\ndiscretisation are realised by employing a novel combination of the direct\napproach used for implicit discretisation of DAEs and, two different classes of\nIMEX-RK schemes: the additive and the multiplicative. For both the time\ndiscretisation strategies, in order to account for rapid plasma oscillations in\nquasineutral regimes, the nonlinear Euler fluxes are split into two different\ncombinations of stiff and non-stiff components. The high order scheme resulting\nfrom the additive approach is designated as a classical scheme while the one\ngenerated by the multiplicative approach possesses the asymptotic preserving\n(AP) property. Time discretisations for the classical and the AP schemes are\nperformed by standard IMEX-RK and SI-IMEX-RK methods, respectively so that the\nstiff terms are treated implicitly and the non-stiff ones explicitly. In order\nto discretise in space a Rusanov-type central flux is used for the non-stiff\npart, and simple central differencing for the stiff part. AP property is also\nestablished for the space-time fully-discrete scheme obtained using the\nmultiplicative approach. Results of numerical experiments are presented, which\nconfirm that the high order schemes based on the SI-IMEX-RK time discretisation\nachieve uniform second order convergence with respect to the Debye length and\nare AP in the quasineutral limit.",

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are generally designed as sequentially cascaded\ndifferentiable blocks/layers with a prediction module connected only to its\nlast layer. DNNs can be attached with prediction modules at multiple points\nalong the backbone where inference can stop at an intermediary stage without\npassing through all the modules. The last exit point may offer a better\nprediction error but also involves more computational resources and latency. An\nexit point that is `optimal' in terms of both prediction error and cost is\ndesirable. The optimal exit point may depend on the latent distribution of the\ntasks and may change from one task type to another. During neural inference,\nthe ground truth of instances may not be available and error rates at each exit\npoint cannot be estimated. Hence one is faced with the problem of selecting the\noptimal exit in an unsupervised setting. Prior works tackled this problem in an\noffline supervised setting assuming that enough labeled data is available to\nestimate the error rate at each exit point and tune the parameters for better\naccuracy. However, pre-trained DNNs are often deployed in new domains for which\na large amount of ground truth may not be available. We model the problem of\nexit selection as an unsupervised online learning problem and use bandit theory\nto identify the optimal exit point. Specifically, we focus on Elastic BERT, a\npre-trained multi-exit DNN to demonstrate that it `nearly' satisfies the Strong\nDominance (SD) property making it possible to learn the optimal exit in an\nonline setup without knowing the ground truth labels. We develop upper\nconfidence bound (UCB) based algorithm named UEE-UCB that provably achieves\nsub-linear regret under the SD property. Thus our method provides a means to\nadaptively learn domain-specific optimal exit points in multi-exit DNNs. We\nempirically validate our algorithm on IMDb and Yelp datasets.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning has shown an outstanding performance in the\napplications of games, particularly in Atari games as well as Go. Based on\nthese successful examples, we attempt to apply one of the well-known\nreinforcement learning algorithms, Deep Q-Network, to the AI Soccer game. AI\nSoccer is a 5:5 robot soccer game where each participant develops an algorithm\nthat controls five robots in a team to defeat the opponent participant. Deep\nQ-Network is designed to implement our original rewards, the state space, and\nthe action space to train each agent so that it can take proper actions in\ndifferent situations during the game. Our algorithm was able to successfully\ntrain the agents, and its performance was preliminarily proven through the\nmini-competition against 10 teams wishing to take part in the AI Soccer\ninternational competition. The competition was organized by the AI World Cup\ncommittee, in conjunction with the WCG 2019 Xi'an AI Masters. With our\nalgorithm, we got the achievement of advancing to the round of 16 in this\ninternational competition with 130 teams from 39 countries.",

    "abstract": "Customer reviews usually contain much information about one's online shopping\nexperience. While positive reviews are beneficial to the stores, negative ones\nwill largely influence consumers' decision and may lead to a decline in sales.\nTherefore, it is of vital importance to carefully and persuasively reply to\neach negative review and minimize its disadvantageous effect. Recent studies\nconsider leveraging generation models to help the sellers respond. However,\nthis problem is not well-addressed as the reviews may contain multiple aspects\nof issues which should be resolved accordingly and persuasively. In this work,\nwe propose a Multi-Source Multi-Aspect Attentive Generation model for\npersuasive response generation. Various sources of information are\nappropriately obtained and leveraged by the proposed model for generating more\ninformative and persuasive responses. A multi-aspect attentive network is\nproposed to automatically attend to different aspects in a review and ensure\nmost of the issues are tackled. Extensive experiments on two real-world\ndatasets, demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethods and online tests prove that our deployed system significantly enhances\nthe efficiency of the stores' dealing with negative reviews.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, deep neural network-based restoration methods have achieved\nstate-of-the-art results in various image deblurring tasks. However, one major\ndrawback of deep learning-based deblurring networks is that large amounts of\nblurry-clean image pairs are required for training to achieve good performance.\nMoreover, deep networks often fail to perform well when the blurry images and\nthe blur kernels during testing are very different from the ones used during\ntraining. This happens mainly because of the overfitting of the network\nparameters on the training data. In this work, we present a method that\naddresses these issues. We view the non-blind image deblurring problem as a\ndenoising problem. To do so, we perform Wiener filtering on a pair of blurry\nimages with the corresponding blur kernels. This results in a pair of images\nwith colored noise. Hence, the deblurring problem is translated into a\ndenoising problem. We then solve the denoising problem without using explicit\nclean target images. Extensive experiments are conducted to show that our\nmethod achieves results that are on par to the state-of-the-art non-blind\ndeblurring works.",

    "abstract": "Complementary-Label Learning (CLL) is a weakly-supervised learning problem\nthat aims to learn a multi-class classifier from only complementary labels,\nwhich indicate a class to which an instance does not belong. Existing\napproaches mainly adopt the paradigm of reduction to ordinary classification,\nwhich applies specific transformations and surrogate losses to connect CLL back\nto ordinary classification. Those approaches, however, face several\nlimitations, such as the tendency to overfit or be hooked on deep models. In\nthis paper, we sidestep those limitations with a novel perspective--reduction\nto probability estimates of complementary classes. We prove that accurate\nprobability estimates of complementary labels lead to good classifiers through\na simple decoding step. The proof establishes a reduction framework from CLL to\nprobability estimates. The framework offers explanations of several key CLL\napproaches as its special cases and allows us to design an improved algorithm\nthat is more robust in noisy environments. The framework also suggests a\nvalidation procedure based on the quality of probability estimates, leading to\nan alternative way to validate models with only complementary labels. The\nflexible framework opens a wide range of unexplored opportunities in using deep\nand non-deep models for probability estimates to solve the CLL problem.\nEmpirical experiments further verified the framework's efficacy and robustness\nin various settings.",

    "abstract": "The majority of methods for crafting adversarial attacks have focused on\nscenes with a single dominant object (e.g., images from ImageNet). On the other\nhand, natural scenes include multiple dominant objects that are semantically\nrelated. Thus, it is crucial to explore designing attack strategies that look\nbeyond learning on single-object scenes or attack single-object victim\nclassifiers. Due to their inherent property of strong transferability of\nperturbations to unknown models, this paper presents the first approach of\nusing generative models for adversarial attacks on multi-object scenes. In\norder to represent the relationships between different objects in the input\nscene, we leverage upon the open-sourced pre-trained vision-language model CLIP\n(Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training), with the motivation to exploit the\nencoded semantics in the language space along with the visual space. We call\nthis attack approach Generative Adversarial Multi-object scene Attacks (GAMA).\nGAMA demonstrates the utility of the CLIP model as an attacker's tool to train\nformidable perturbation generators for multi-object scenes. Using the joint\nimage-text features to train the generator, we show that GAMA can craft potent\ntransferable perturbations in order to fool victim classifiers in various\nattack settings. For example, GAMA triggers ~16% more misclassification than\nstate-of-the-art generative approaches in black-box settings where both the\nclassifier architecture and data distribution of the attacker are different\nfrom the victim.

In each\niteration, iPSR takes as input point samples with normals directly computed\nfrom the surface obtained in the preceding iteration, and then generates a new\nsurface with better quality.

Recently, science question benchmarks have\nbeen used to diagnose the multi-hop reasoning ability and interpretability of\nan AI system. However, existing datasets fail to provide annotations for the\nanswers, or are restricted to the textual-only modality, small scales, and\nlimited domain diversity. To this end, we present Science Question Answering\n(SQA), a new benchmark that consists of ~21k multimodal multiple choice\nquestions with a diverse set of science topics and annotations of their answers\nwith corresponding lectures and explanations. We further design language models\nto learn to generate lectures and explanations as the chain of thought (CoT) to\nmimic the multi-hop reasoning process when answering SQA questions. SQA\ndemonstrates the utility of CoT in language models, as CoT improves the\nquestion answering performance by 1.20% in few-shot GPT-3 and 3.99% in\nfine-tuned UnifiedQA. We also explore the upper bound for models to leverage\nexplanations by feeding those in the input; we observe that it improves the\nfew-shot performance of GPT-3 by 18.96%.

We propose a novel, task-prioritized\ncomposition framework for Reinforcement Learning, which involves a novel\nconcept: The indifferent-space of Reinforcement Learning policies. Our\nframework has the potential to facilitate knowledge transfer and modular design\nwhile greatly increasing data efficiency and data reuse for Reinforcement\nLearning agents. Further, our approach can ensure high-priority constraint\nsatisfaction, which makes it promising for learning in safety-critical domains\nlike robotics. Unlike null-space control, our approach allows learning globally\noptimal policies for the compound task by online learning in the\nindifference-space of higher-level policies after initial compound policy\nconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Capturing the long-range dependencies has empirically proven to be effective\non a wide range of computer vision tasks. The progressive advances on this\ntopic have been made through the employment of the transformer framework with\nthe help of the multi-head attention mechanism. However, the attention-based\nimage patch interaction potentially suffers from problems of redundant\ninteractions of intra-class patches and unoriented interactions of inter-class\npatches. In this paper, we propose a novel Graph Reasoning Transformer (GReaT)\nfor image parsing to enable image patches to interact following a relation\nreasoning pattern. Specifically, the linearly embedded image patches are first\nprojected into the graph space, where each node represents the implicit visual\ncenter for a cluster of image patches and each edge reflects the relation\nweight between two adjacent nodes. After that, global relation reasoning is\nperformed on this graph accordingly. Finally, all nodes including the relation\ninformation are mapped back into the original space for subsequent processes.\nCompared to the conventional transformer, GReaT has higher interaction\nefficiency and a more purposeful interaction pattern. Experiments are carried\nout on the challenging Cityscapes and ADE20K datasets. Results show that GReaT\nachieves consistent performance gains with slight computational overheads on\nthe state-of-the-art transformer baselines.",

    "abstract": "Resolving bugs in the maintenance phase of software is a complicated task.\nBug assignment is one of the main tasks for resolving bugs. Some Bugs cannot be\nfixed properly without making design decisions and have to be assigned to\ndesigners, rather than programmers, to avoid emerging bad smells that may cause\nsubsequent bug reports. Hence, it is important to refer some bugs to the\ndesigner to check the possible design flaws. Based on our best knowledge, there\nare a few works that have considered referring bugs to designers. Hence, this\nissue is considered in this work. In this paper, a dataset is created, and a\nCNN-based model is proposed to predict the need for assigning a bug to a\ndesigner by learning the peculiarities of bug reports effective in creating bad\nsmells in the code. The features of each bug are extracted from CNN based on\nits textual features, such as a summary and description. The number of bad\nsamples added to it in the fixing process using the PMD tool determines the bug\ntag. The summary and description of the new bug are given to the model and the\nmodel predicts the need to refer to the designer. The accuracy of 75% (or more)\nwas achieved for datasets with a sufficient number of samples for deep\nlearning-based model training. A model is proposed to predict bug referrals to\nthe designer. The efficiency of the model in predicting referrals to the\ndesigner at the time of receiving the bug report was demonstrated by testing\nthe model on 10 projects.",

Despite lots of works that have achieved\nconsiderable progress for RIS, in this work, we explore an essential question,\n\"what if the description is wrong or misleading of the text description?\". We\nterm such a sentence as a negative sentence. However, we find that existing\nworks cannot handle such settings. To this end, we propose a novel formulation\nof RIS, named Robust Referring Image Segmentation (R-RIS). It considers the\nnegative sentence inputs besides the regularly given text inputs. We present\nthree different datasets via augmenting the input negative sentences and a new\nmetric to unify both input types. Furthermore, we design a new\ntransformer-based model named RefSegformer, where we introduce a token-based\nvision and language fusion module. Such module can be easily extended to our\nR-RIS setting by adding extra blank tokens. Our proposed RefSegformer achieves\nthe new state-of-the-art results on three regular RIS datasets and three R-RIS\ndatasets, which serves as a new solid baseline for further research.

Application-layer attacks, which\ninvolve the creation of malicious packets, are deemed feasible from remote but\ncan be easily detected by modern IDS. On the other hand, more recent link-layer\nattacks are stealthier and possibly more disruptive but require physical access\nto the bus.

We demonstrate that it is possible to deploy stealthy CAN link-layer\nattacks from a remotely compromised ECU, targeting another ECU on the same CAN\nnetwork. To do this, we exploit the presence of pin conflicts between\nmicrocontroller peripherals to craft polyglot frames, which allows an attacker\nto control the CAN traffic at the bit level and bypass the protocol's rules. We\nexperimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on high-, mid-,\nand low-end microcontrollers, and we provide the ground for future research by\nreleasing an extensible tool that can be used to implement our approach on\ndifferent platforms and to build CAN countermeasures at the data link layer.",

In\nparticular, two CR-NOMA transmission protocols are developed by utilizing the\nkey features of different data generation models and applying CR-NOMA as an\nadd-on to a legacy orthogonal multiple access (OMA) based network. The fact\nthat the implementation of CR-NOMA causes little disruption to the legacy OMA\nnetwork means that the proposed CR-NOMA protocols can be practically\nimplemented in various communication systems which are based on OMA.\nClosed-form expressions for the AoI achieved by the proposed NOMA protocols are\ndeveloped to facilitate performance evaluation, and asymptotic studies are\ncarried out to identify two benefits of using NOMA to reduce the AoI in\nwireless networks. One is that the use of NOMA provides users more\nopportunities to transmit, which means that the users can update their base\nstation more frequently. The other is that the use of NOMA can reduce access\ndelay, i.e., the users are scheduled to transmit earlier than in the OMA case,\nwhich is useful to improve the freshness of the data available in the wireless\nnetwork.",

Typically, machine learning models in classification or\nsegmentation are only developed to provide binary answers; however, quantifying\nthe uncertainty of the models can play a critical role for example in active\nlearning or machine human interaction. Uncertainty quantification is especially\ndifficult when using deep learning-based models, which are the state-of-the-art\nin many imaging applications.

    "abstract": "Attention-based neural networks have become pervasive in many AI tasks.\nDespite their excellent algorithmic performance, the use of the attention\nmechanism and feed-forward network (FFN) demands excessive computational and\nmemory resources, which often compromises their hardware performance. Although\nvarious sparse variants have been introduced, most approaches only focus on\nmitigating the quadratic scaling of attention on the algorithm level, without\nexplicitly considering the efficiency of mapping their methods on real hardware\ndesigns. Furthermore, most efforts only focus on either the attention mechanism\nor the FFNs but without jointly optimizing both parts, causing most of the\ncurrent designs to lack scalability when dealing with different input lengths.\nThis paper systematically considers the sparsity patterns in different variants\nfrom a hardware perspective. On the algorithmic level, we propose FABNet, a\nhardware-friendly variant that adopts a unified butterfly sparsity pattern to\napproximate both the attention mechanism and the FFNs. On the hardware level, a\nnovel adaptable butterfly accelerator is proposed that can be configured at\nruntime via dedicated hardware control to accelerate different butterfly layers\nusing a single unified hardware engine. On the Long-Range-Arena dataset, FABNet\nachieves the same accuracy as the vanilla Transformer while reducing the amount\nof computation by 10 to 66 times and the number of parameters 2 to 22 times. By\njointly optimizing the algorithm and hardware, our FPGA-based butterfly\naccelerator achieves 14.2 to 23.2 times speedup over state-of-the-art\naccelerators normalized to the same computational budget. Compared with\noptimized CPU and GPU designs on Raspberry Pi 4 and Jetson Nano, our system is\nup to 273.8 and 15.1 times faster under the same power budget.",

One primary threat is from adversarial attacks.\nResearchers have intensively studied this threat for several years and proposed\ndozens of approaches to create adversarial examples (AEs). But most of the\napproaches are only evaluated on limited models and datasets (e.g., MNIST,\nCIFAR-10). Thus, the effectiveness of attacking real-world DL models is not\nquite clear. In this paper, we perform the first systematic study of\nadversarial attacks on real-world DNN models and provide a real-world model\ndataset named RWM. Particularly, we design a suite of approaches to adapt\ncurrent AE generation algorithms to the diverse real-world DL models, including\nautomatically extracting DL models from Android apps, capturing the inputs and\noutputs of the DL models in apps, generating AEs and validating them by\nobserving the apps' execution. For black-box DL models, we design a\nsemantic-based approach to build suitable datasets and use them for training\nsubstitute models when performing transfer-based attacks. After analyzing 245\nDL models collected from 62,583 real-world apps, we have a unique opportunity\nto understand the gap between real-world DL models and contemporary AE\ngeneration algorithms.

This work, therefore, presents the design and\noptimization of a measurement system for the detection of bioparticles over the\nfrequency range $0.01$ to $10$ $\\mathrm{GHz}$, with different coplanar\nelectrodes configurations on a microfluidic platform. The design of the\nmeasurement signal-chain setup is optimized for a novel real-time\nsuperheterodyne microwave detection system. In particular, signal integrity is\nachieved by means of a microwave-shielded chamber, which is protected from\nexternal electromagnetic interference that may potentially impact the coplanar\nelectrodes mounted on the microfluidic device. Additionally, analytical\nexpressions and experimental validation of the system-level performance are\nprovided and discussed for the different designs of the coplanar electrodes.\nThis technique is applied to measure the electrical field perturbation produced\nby $10$ $\\mathrm{\\mu m}$ polystyrene beads with a concentration of $10^5$\n$\\mathrm{beads/mL}$, and flowing at a rate of $10$ $\\mathrm{\\mu L/m}$. The\nachieved SNR is in the order of $40$ $\\mathrm{dB}$ for the three coplanar\nelectrodes considered.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this work is to help mitigate the already existing gender wage\ngap by supplying unbiased job recommendations based on resumes from job\nseekers. We employ a generative adversarial network to remove gender bias from\nword2vec representations of 12M job vacancy texts and 900k resumes. Our results\nshow that representations created from recruitment texts contain algorithmic\nbias and that this bias results in real-world consequences for recommendation\nsystems. Without controlling for bias, women are recommended jobs with\nsignificantly lower salary in our data. With adversarially fair\nrepresentations, this wage gap disappears, meaning that our debiased job\nrecommendations reduce wage discrimination. We conclude that adversarial\ndebiasing of word representations can increase real-world fairness of systems\nand thus may be part of the solution for creating fairness-aware recommendation\nsystems.",

In-person or screen sharing\nsupport is helpful but limited by the help-givers' availability. Video\ntutorials can be useful but require users to switch contexts between watching\nthe tutorial and performing the corresponding actions in the app, which is\ncumbersome to do on a mobile phone. Although interactive tutorials have been\nshown to be promising, none was designed for older adults. Furthermore, the\ntrial-and-error approach has been shown to be beneficial for older adults, but\nthey often lack support to use the approach. Inspired by both interactive\ntutorials and trial-and-error approach, we designed an app-independent mobile\nservice, \\textit{Synapse}, for help-givers to create a multimodal interactive\ntutorial on a smartphone and for help-receivers (e.g., older adults) to receive\ninteractive guidance with trial-and-error support when they work on the same\ntask. We conducted a user study with 18 older adults who were 60 and over.

Indeed, our analysis shows that up to 35% of IoT\ntraffic is exchanged with IoT backend servers located in other continents.

    "abstract": "In recent years, deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been successful in\nvarious combinatorial search domains, such as two-player games and scientific\ndiscovery. However, directly applying deep RL in planning domains is still\nchallenging. One major difficulty is that without a human-crafted heuristic\nfunction, reward signals remain zero unless the learning framework discovers\nany solution plan. Search space becomes \\emph{exponentially larger} as the\nminimum length of plans grows, which is a serious limitation for planning\ninstances with a minimum plan length of hundreds to thousands of steps.\nPrevious learning frameworks that augment graph search with deep neural\nnetworks and extra generated subgoals have achieved success in various\nchallenging planning domains. However, generating useful subgoals requires\nextensive domain knowledge. We propose a domain-independent method that\naugments graph search with graph value iteration to solve hard planning\ninstances that are out of reach for domain-specialized solvers. In particular,\ninstead of receiving learning signals only from discovered plans, our approach\nalso learns from failed search attempts where no goal state has been reached.\nThe graph value iteration component can exploit the graph structure of local\nsearch space and provide more informative learning signals. We also show how we\nuse a curriculum strategy to smooth the learning process and perform a full\nanalysis of how graph value iteration scales and enables learning.",

The core idea of CBS is to\nrun hierarchical search, when, on the high level the tree of solutions\ncandidates is explored, and on the low-level an individual planning for a\nspecific agent (subject to certain constraints) is carried out. To trade-off\noptimality for running time different variants of bounded sub-optimal CBS were\ndesigned, which alter both high- and low-level search routines of CBS.\nMoreover, anytime variant of CBS does exist that applies Focal Search (FS) to\nthe high-level of CBS - Anytime BCBS. However, no comprehensive analysis of how\nwell this algorithm performs compared to the naive one, when we simply\nre-invoke CBS with the decreased sub-optimality bound, was present. This work\naims at filling this gap. Moreover, we present and evaluate another anytime\nversion of CBS that uses FS on both levels of CBS. Empirically, we show that\nits behavior is principally different from the one demonstrated by Anytime\nBCBS.

    "abstract": "Optimization-based meta-learning aims to learn an initialization so that a\nnew unseen task can be learned within a few gradient updates. Model Agnostic\nMeta-Learning (MAML) is a benchmark algorithm comprising two optimization\nloops. The inner loop is dedicated to learning a new task and the outer loop\nleads to meta-initialization. However, ANIL (almost no inner loop) algorithm\nshows that feature reuse is an alternative to rapid learning in MAML. Thus, the\nmeta-initialization phase makes MAML primed for feature reuse and obviates the\nneed for rapid learning. Contrary to ANIL, we hypothesize that there may be a\nneed to learn new features during meta-testing. A new unseen task from\nnon-similar distribution would necessitate rapid learning in addition reuse and\nrecombination of existing features. In this paper, we invoke the width-depth\nduality of neural networks, wherein, we increase the width of the network by\nadding extra computational units (ACU). The ACUs enable the learning of new\natomic features in the meta-testing task, and the associated increased width\nfacilitates information propagation in the forwarding pass. The newly learnt\nfeatures combine with existing features in the last layer for meta-learning.\nExperimental results show that our proposed MAC method outperformed existing\nANIL algorithm for non-similar task distribution by approximately 13% (5-shot\ntask setting)",

    "abstract": "Universal domain adaptation (UniDA) aims to transfer the knowledge of common\nclasses from source domain to target domain without any prior knowledge on the\nlabel set, which requires to distinguish the unknown samples from the known\nones in the target domain. Like the traditional unsupervised domain adaptation\nproblem, the misalignment between two domains exists due to the biased and\nless-discriminative embedding. Recent methods proposed to complete the domain\nmisalignment by clustering target samples with the nearest neighbors or the\nprototypes. However, it is dangerous to do so since we do not have any prior\nknowledge about the distributions of unknown samples which can magnify the\nmisalignment especially when the unknown set is big. Meanwhile, other existing\nclassifier-based methods could easily produce overconfident predictions of\nunknown samples because of the supervised objective in source domain leading\nthe whole model to be biased towards the common classes in the target domain.\nTherefore, we propose a novel non-parameter unknown samples detection method\nbased on mapping the samples in the original feature space into a reliable\nlinear sub-space which makes data points more sparse to reduce the misalignment\nbetween unknown samples and source samples. Moreover, unlike the recent methods\napplying extra parameters to improve the classification of unknown samples,\nthis paper well balances the confidence values of both known and unknown\nsamples through an unknown-adaptive margin loss which can control the gradient\nupdating of the classifier learning on supervised source samples depending on\nthe confidence level of detected unknown samples at current step.

The compression problem asks for a subset of\nnotes of a given melody such that the matching cost between the selected notes\nand the reference melody is minimized.",

    "abstract": "Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a powerful and more bio-plausible alternative\nto conventional learning frameworks such as backpropagation. The effectiveness\nof EP stems from the fact that it relies only on local computations and\nrequires solely one kind of computational unit during both of its training\nphases, thereby enabling greater applicability in domains such as bio-inspired\nneuromorphic computing. The dynamics of the model in EP is governed by an\nenergy function and the internal states of the model consequently converge to a\nsteady state following the state transition rules defined by the same. However,\nby definition, EP requires the input to the model (a convergent RNN) to be\nstatic in both the phases of training. Thus it is not possible to design a\nmodel for sequence classification using EP with an LSTM or GRU like\narchitecture. In this paper, we leverage recent developments in modern hopfield\nnetworks to further understand energy based models and develop solutions for\ncomplex sequence classification tasks using EP while satisfying its convergence\ncriteria and maintaining its theoretical similarities with recurrent\nbackpropagation. We explore the possibility of integrating modern hopfield\nnetworks as an attention mechanism with convergent RNN models used in EP,\nthereby extending its applicability for the first time on two different\nsequence classification tasks in natural language processing viz. sentiment\nanalysis (IMDB dataset) and natural language inference (SNLI dataset).",

    "abstract": "Audio-visual source localization is a challenging task that aims to predict\nthe location of visual sound sources in a video. Since collecting ground-truth\nannotations of sounding objects can be costly, a plethora of weakly-supervised\nlocalization methods that can learn from datasets with no bounding-box\nannotations have been proposed in recent years, by leveraging the natural\nco-occurrence of audio and visual signals. Despite significant interest,\npopular evaluation protocols have two major flaws. First, they allow for the\nuse of a fully annotated dataset to perform early stopping, thus significantly\nincreasing the annotation effort required for training. Second, current\nevaluation metrics assume the presence of sound sources at all times. This is\nof course an unrealistic assumption, and thus better metrics are necessary to\ncapture the model's performance on (negative) samples with no visible sound\nsources. To accomplish this, we extend the test set of popular benchmarks,\nFlickr SoundNet and VGG-Sound Sources, in order to include negative samples,\nand measure performance using metrics that balance localization accuracy and\nrecall. Using the new protocol, we conducted an extensive evaluation of prior\nmethods, and found that most prior works are not capable of identifying\nnegatives and suffer from significant overfitting problems (rely heavily on\nearly stopping for best results). We also propose a new approach for visual\nsound source localization that addresses both these problems. In particular, we\nfound that, through extreme visual dropout and the use of momentum encoders,\nthe proposed approach combats overfitting effectively, and establishes a new\nstate-of-the-art performance on both Flickr SoundNet and VGG-Sound Source.

    "abstract": "Despite the undeniable progress in visual recognition tasks fueled by deep\nneural networks, there exists recent evidence showing that these models are\npoorly calibrated, resulting in over-confident predictions. The standard\npractices of minimizing the cross entropy loss during training promote the\npredicted softmax probabilities to match the one-hot label assignments.\nNevertheless, this yields a pre-softmax activation of the correct class that is\nsignificantly larger than the remaining activations, which exacerbates the\nmiscalibration problem. Recent observations from the classification literature\nsuggest that loss functions that embed implicit or explicit maximization of the\nentropy of predictions yield state-of-the-art calibration performances. Despite\nthese findings, the impact of these losses in the relevant task of calibrating\nmedical image segmentation networks remains unexplored. In this work, we\nprovide a unifying constrained-optimization perspective of current\nstate-of-the-art calibration losses. Specifically, these losses could be viewed\nas approximations of a linear penalty (or a Lagrangian term) imposing equality\nconstraints on logit distances. This points to an important limitation of such\nunderlying equality constraints, whose ensuing gradients constantly push\ntowards a non-informative solution, which might prevent from reaching the best\ncompromise between the discriminative performance and calibration of the model\nduring gradient-based optimization. Following our observations, we propose a\nsimple and flexible generalization based on inequality constraints, which\nimposes a controllable margin on logit distances. Comprehensive experiments on\na variety of public medical image segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our\nmethod sets novel state-of-the-art results on these tasks in terms of network\ncalibration, whereas the discriminative performance is also improved.",

This technique constructs the network includes three main parts: 1)\nthe stationary transform layer, 2) the feature encoding layers, and 3) the fine\ntuning regression layer. The stationary transform layer recognizes the order of\ninput function data, and transforms non-stationary function to stationary\nfunction. The feature encoding layers encode the raw input sequential data to a\nnovel linear regression feature that can capture both the structural and the\ntemporal characters of the sequential data. The fine tuning regression layer\nthen fits the features to the target ahead values.

    "abstract": "Physical systems whose dynamics are governed by partial differential\nequations (PDEs) find applications in numerous fields, from engineering design\nto weather forecasting. The process of obtaining the solution from such PDEs\nmay be computationally expensive for large-scale and parameterized problems. In\nthis work, deep learning techniques developed especially for time-series\nforecasts, such as LSTM and TCN, or for spatial-feature extraction such as CNN,\nare employed to model the system dynamics for advection dominated problems.\nThese models take as input a sequence of high-fidelity vector solutions for\nconsecutive time-steps obtained from the PDEs and forecast the solutions for\nthe subsequent time-steps using auto-regression; thereby reducing the\ncomputation time and power needed to obtain such high-fidelity solutions. The\nmodels are tested on numerical benchmarks (1D Burgers' equation and Stoker's\ndam break problem) to assess the long-term prediction accuracy, even outside\nthe training domain (extrapolation). Non-intrusive reduced-order modelling\ntechniques such as deep auto-encoder networks are utilized to compress the\nhigh-fidelity snapshots before feeding them as input to the forecasting models\nin order to reduce the complexity and the required computations in the online\nand offline stages. Deep ensembles are employed to perform uncertainty\nquantification of the forecasting models, which provides information about the\nvariance of the predictions as a result of the epistemic uncertainties.",

Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the\nrobustness of advanced DNNs using adversarial attacks. However, traditional\nphysical attacks that use stickers as perturbations are more vulnerable than\nrecent light-based physical attacks. In this work, we propose a projector-based\nphysical attack called adversarial color projection (AdvCP), which performs an\nadversarial attack by manipulating the physical parameters of the projected\nlight. Experiments show the effectiveness of our method in both digital and\nphysical environments. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod has excellent attack transferability, which endows AdvCP with effective\nblackbox attack.

Today, these\nemerging BCI applications are typically still at early technology readiness\nlevels, but because BCIs create novel, technical communication channels for the\nhuman brain, they have raised privacy and security concerns. To mitigate such\nrisks, a large body of countermeasures has been proposed in the literature, but\na general framework is lacking which would describe how privacy and security of\nBCI applications can be protected by design, i.e., already as an integral part\nof the early BCI design process, in a systematic manner, and allowing suitable\ndepth of analysis for different contexts such as commercial BCI product\ndevelopment vs. academic research and lab prototypes. Here we propose the\nadoption of recent systems-engineering methodologies for privacy threat\nmodeling, risk assessment, and privacy engineering to the BCI field. These\nmethodologies address privacy and security concerns in a more systematic and\nholistic way than previous approaches, and provide reusable patterns on how to\nmove from principles to actions. We apply these methodologies to BCI and data\nflows and derive a generic, extensible, and actionable framework for\nbrain-privacy-preserving cybersecurity in BCI applications. This framework is\ndesigned for flexible application to the wide range of current and future BCI\napplications. We also propose a range of novel privacy-by-design features for\nBCIs, with an emphasis on features promoting BCI transparency as a prerequisite\nfor informational self-determination of BCI users, as well as design features\nfor ensuring BCI user autonomy.

    "abstract": "The estimation of 6D poses of rigid objects is a fundamental problem in\ncomputer vision. Traditionally pose estimation is concerned with the\ndetermination of a single best estimate. However, a single estimate is unable\nto express visual ambiguity, which in many cases is unavoidable due to object\nsymmetries or occlusion of identifying features. Inability to account for\nambiguities in pose can lead to failure in subsequent methods, which is\nunacceptable when the cost of failure is high. Estimates of full pose\ndistributions are, contrary to single estimates, well suited for expressing\nuncertainty on pose. Motivated by this, we propose a novel pose distribution\nestimation method. An implicit formulation of the probability distribution over\nobject pose is derived from an intermediary representation of an object as a\nset of keypoints. This ensures that the pose distribution estimates have a high\nlevel of interpretability. Furthermore, our method is based on conservative\napproximations, which leads to reliable estimates.

    "title": "Frame Size Optimization Using a Machine Learning Approach in WLAN  Downlink MU-MIMO Channel",
    "abstract": "The IEEE 802.11ac/n introduced frame aggregation technology to accommodate\nthe growing traffic demand and increase the performance of transmission\nefficiency and channel utilization. This is achieved by allowing many packets\nto be aggregated per transmission which realized a significant enhancement in\nthe throughput performance of WLAN. However, it is difficult to efficiently\nutilize the benefits of frame aggregation in the downlink MU-MIMO channels as\nstations have heterogeneous transmission demands and data transmission rates.\nAs a result of this, wasted space channel time will occur which degrades\ntransmission efficiency. In addressing these challenges, the existing studies\nhave proposed different approaches. However, most of these approaches did not\nconsider a machine-Learning based optimization solution. The main contribution\nof this paper is to propose a machine-learning-based frame size optimization\nsolution to maximize the system throughput of WLAN in the downlink MU-MIMO\nchannel. In this approach, the Access Point (AP) performs the maximum system\nthroughput measurement and collected frame size-system throughput patterns\nwhich contain knowledge about the effects of traffic patterns, channel\nconditions, and number of stations(STAs). Based on these patterns,our approach\nuses a neural network to correctly model the system throughput as a function of\nthe system frame size. After training the neural network, we obtain the\ngradient information to adjust the frame size. the performance of the proposed\nMachine learning(ML) approach is evaluated over the FIFO aggregation algorithm\nunder the effects of heterogenous traffic patterns for VoIP and video\napplications, channel conditions, and number of stations.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven to be successful in several\npredictive modeling tasks for graph-structured data.\nAmongst those tasks, link prediction is one of the fundamental problems for\nmany real-world applications, such as recommender systems.\nHowever, GNNs are not immune to adversarial attacks, i.e., carefully crafted\nmalicious examples that are designed to fool the predictive model.\nIn this work, we focus on a specific, white-box attack to GNN-based link\nprediction models, where a malicious node aims to appear in the list of\nrecommended nodes for a given target victim.\nTo achieve this goal, the attacker node may also count on the cooperation of\nother existing peers that it directly controls, namely on the ability to inject\na number of ``vicious'' nodes in the network.\nSpecifically, all these malicious nodes can add new edges or remove existing\nones, thereby perturbing the original graph.\nThus, we propose SAVAGE, a novel framework and a method to mount this type of\nlink prediction attacks.\nSAVAGE formulates the adversary's goal as an optimization task, striking the\nbalance between the effectiveness of the attack and the sparsity of malicious\nresources required.\nExtensive experiments conducted on real-world and synthetic datasets\ndemonstrate that adversarial attacks implemented through SAVAGE indeed achieve\nhigh attack success rate yet using a small amount of vicious nodes.\nFinally, despite those attacks require full knowledge of the target model, we\nshow that they are successfully transferable to other black-box methods for\nlink prediction.",

    "abstract": "Rescue missions in mountain environments are hardly achievable by standard\nlegged robots - because of the high slopes - or by flying robots - because of\nlimited payload capacity. We present a novel concept for a rope-aided climbing\nrobot, which can negotiate up-to-vertical slopes and carry heavy payloads. The\nrobot is attached to the mountain through a rope, and is equipped with a leg to\npush against the mountain and initiate jumping maneuvers. Between jumps, a\nhoist is used to wind/unwind the rope to move vertically and affect the lateral\nmotion. This simple (yet effective) two-fold actuation allows the system to\nachieve high safety and energy efficiency. Indeed, the rope prevents the robot\nfrom falling, while compensating for most of its weight, drastically reducing\nthe effort required by the leg actuator. We also present an optimal control\nstrategy to generate point-to-point trajectories overcoming an obstacle. We\nachieve fast computation time ($<$1 s) thanks to the use of a custom simplified\nrobot model. We validated the generated optimal movements in Gazebo simulations\nwith a complete robot model, showing the effectiveness of the proposed\napproach, and confirming the interest of our concept. Finally, we performed a\nreachability analysis showing that the region of achievable targets is strongly\naffected by the friction properties of the foot-wall contact.",

We\npresent a novel condition on barrier certificates, termed the invariant\nbarrier-certificate condition, that witnesses unbounded-time safety of\ndifferential dynamical systems. The proposed condition is the weakest possible\none to attain inductive invariance. We show that discharging the invariant\nbarrier-certificate condition -- thereby synthesizing invariant barrier\ncertificates -- can be encoded as solving an optimization problem subject to\nbilinear matrix inequalities (BMIs). We further propose a synthesis algorithm\nbased on difference-of-convex programming, which approaches a local optimum of\nthe BMI problem via solving a series of convex optimization problems.

    "abstract": "Cascading failure causes a major risk to society currently. To effectively\nmitigate the risk, dynamic thermal rating (DTR) technique can be applied as a\ncost-effective strategy to exploit potential transmission capability. From the\nperspectives of service life and Braess paradox, it is important and\nchallenging to jointly optimize the DTR placement and operation schedule for\nchanging system state, which is a two-stage combinatorial problem with only\ndiscrete variables, suffering from no approximation guarantee and dimension\ncurse only based on traditional models. Thus, the present work proposes a novel\ntwo-stage submodular optimization (TSSO) of DTR for risk mitigation considering\nplacement and operation schedule. Specifically, it optimizes DTR placement with\nproper redundancy in first stage, and then determines the corresponding DTR\noperation for each system state in second stage. Under the condition of the\nMarkov and submodular features in sub-function of risk mitigation, the\nsubmodularity of total objective function of TSSO can be proven for the first\ntime.

However, manually\nchecking whether a given DPA complies with GDPR is challenging as it requires\nsignificant time and effort for understanding and identifying DPA-relevant\ncompliance requirements in GDPR and then verifying these requirements in the\nDPA. In this paper, we propose an automated solution to check the compliance of\na given DPA against GDPR.

Then, we developed an automated solution\nthat leverages natural language processing (NLP) technologies to check the\ncompliance of a given DPA against these \"shall\" requirements. Specifically, our\napproach automatically generates phrasal-level representations for the textual\ncontent of the DPA and compares it against predefined representations of the\n\"shall\" requirements. Over a dataset of 30 actual DPAs, the approach correctly\nfinds 618 out of 750 genuine violations while raising 76 false violations, and\nfurther correctly identifies 524 satisfied requirements. The approach has thus\nan average precision of 89.1%, a recall of 82.4%, and an accuracy of 84.6%.\nCompared to a baseline that relies on off-the-shelf NLP tools, our approach\nprovides an average accuracy gain of ~20 percentage points.

In\naddition, the point representation of the destination limits the utilization of\na rich road context, leading to inaccurate prediction results in many cases.\nGoal area, i.e., the possible destination area, rather than goal coordinate,\ncould provide a more soft constraint for searching potential trajectories by\ninvolving more tolerance and guidance.

In\nthis work, we show how to seamlessly combine nearly any GNN model with the\ncomputational capabilities of GDBs. For this, we observe that the majority of\nthese systems are based on, or support, a graph data model called the Labeled\nProperty Graph (LPG), where vertices and edges can have arbitrarily complex\nsets of labels and properties. We then develop LPG2vec, an encoder that\ntransforms an arbitrary LPG dataset into a representation that can be directly\nused with a broad class of GNNs, including convolutional, attentional,\nmessage-passing, and even higher-order or spectral models. In our evaluation,\nwe show that the rich information represented as LPG labels and properties is\nproperly preserved by LPG2vec, and it increases the accuracy of predictions\nregardless of the targeted learning task or the used GNN model, by up to 34%\ncompared to graphs with no LPG labels/properties.

    "abstract": "Modelling long-range dependencies is critical for scene understanding tasks\nin computer vision. Although convolution neural networks (CNNs) have excelled\nin many vision tasks, they are still limited in capturing long-range structured\nrelationships as they typically consist of layers of local kernels. A\nfully-connected graph, such as the self-attention operation in Transformers, is\nbeneficial for such modelling, however, its computational overhead is\nprohibitive. In this paper, we propose a dynamic graph message passing network,\nthat significantly reduces the computational complexity compared to related\nworks modelling a fully-connected graph. This is achieved by adaptively\nsampling nodes in the graph, conditioned on the input, for message passing.\nBased on the sampled nodes, we dynamically predict node-dependent filter\nweights and the affinity matrix for propagating information between them. This\nformulation allows us to design a self-attention module, and more importantly a\nnew Transformer-based backbone network, that we use for both image\nclassification pretraining, and for addressing various downstream tasks (object\ndetection, instance and semantic segmentation). Using this model, we show\nsignificant improvements with respect to strong, state-of-the-art baselines on\nfour different tasks.

However, previous methods only model\nthe feature interactions between the textual and either acoustic and visual\nmodalities, ignoring capturing the feature interactions between the acoustic\nand visual modalities. In this paper, we propose the multi-modal end-to-end\ntransformer (ME2ET), which can effectively model the tri-modal features\ninteraction among the textual, acoustic, and visual modalities at the low-level\nand high-level.

This is mainly due to the low precision of many existing\nmethods to detect threats, producing a substantial number of false positives.\nUsually, several signature-based and statistical anomaly detectors are\nimplemented within a computer network to detect threats. Recent efforts in User\nand Entity Behaviour Analytics modelling shed a light on how to reduce the\nburden on Security Operations Centre analysts through a better understanding of\npeer-group behaviour. Statistically, the challenge consists of accurately\ngrouping users with similar behaviour, and then identifying those who deviate\nfrom their peers. This work proposes a new approach for peer-group behaviour\nmodelling of Windows authentication events, using principles from hierarchical\nBayesian models. This is a two-stage approach where in the first stage,\npeer-groups are formed based on a data-driven method, given the user's\nindividual authentication pattern. In the second stage, the counts of users\nauthenticating to different entities are aggregated by an hour and modelled by\na Poisson distribution, taking into account seasonality components and\nhierarchical principles. Finally, we compare grouping users based on their\nhuman resources records against the data-driven methods and provide empirical\nevidence about alert reduction on a real-world authentication data set from a\nlarge enterprise network.",

As there\nexist uncertainties in EVs' remaining energy, arrival and departure time, and\nfuture electricity prices, it is quite difficult to make charging decisions to\nminimize charging cost while guarantee that the EV's battery\nstate-of-the-charge (SOC) is within certain range. To handle with this dilemma,\nthis paper formulates the EV charging scheduling problem as a constrained\nMarkov decision process (CMDP). By synergistically combining the augmented\nLagrangian method and soft actor critic algorithm, a novel safe off-policy\nreinforcement learning (RL) approach is proposed in this paper to solve the\nCMDP. The actor network is updated in a policy gradient manner with the\nLagrangian value function. A double-critics network is adopted to synchronously\nestimate the action-value function to avoid overestimation bias. The proposed\nalgorithm does not require strong convexity guarantee of examined problems and\nis sample efficient.

Our method builds on differentiable generalized ICP (GICP), and we\npropose using the differentiable K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm to enhance\ndifferentiability. The differentiable GICP algorithm provides the gradient of\noutput pose estimation with respect to each input point, which allows us to\ntrain a neural network to predict its importance, or weight, in estimating the\ncorrect pose. In contrast to the other ICP-based methods that use voxel-based\ndownsampling or matching methods to reduce the computational cost, our method\ndirectly reduces the number of points used for GICP by only selecting those\nwith the highest weights and ignoring redundant ones with lower weights. We\nshow that our method improves both accuracy and speed of the GICP algorithm for\nthe KITTI dataset and can be used to develop a more robust and efficient SLAM\nsystem.",

However, contemporary AI systems are built by composing many\npreexisting software modules that pass through many hands before becoming a\nfinished product or service. How does this shape responsible AI practice? In\ninterviews with 27 AI engineers across industry, open source, and academia, our\nparticipants often did not see the questions posed in responsible AI guidelines\nto be within their agency, capability, or responsibility to address. We use\nLucy Suchman's notion of located accountability to show how responsible AI\nlabor is currently organized, and to explore how it could be done differently.\nWe identify cross-cutting social logics, like modularizability, scale,\nreputation, and customer orientation, that organize which responsible AI\nactions do take place, and which are relegated to low status staff or believed\nto be the work of the next or previous person in the chain. We argue that\ncurrent responsible AI interventions, like ethics checklists and guidelines\nthat assume panoptical knowledge and control over systems, could improve by\ntaking a located accountability approach, where relations and obligations\nintertwine and incrementally add value in the process. This would constitute a\nshift from ``supply chain'' thinking to ``value chain'' thinking.",

To address the challenge, we treat the crowd as a continuum and\nformulate the evacuation objective as driving the crowd density to target\nlocations. We propose a novel mean-field model which consists of a family of\nmicroscopic equations that explicitly model how human motions are locally\nguided by the robots and an associated macroscopic equation that describes how\nthe crowd density is controlled by the navigation velocity fields generated by\nall robots. Then, we design density feedback controllers for the robots to\ndynamically adjust their states such that the generated navigation velocity\nfields drive the crowd density to a target density.

    "abstract": "Online platforms face pressure to keep their communities civil and\nrespectful. Thus, the bannings of problematic online communities from\nmainstream platforms like Reddit and Facebook are often met with enthusiastic\npublic reactions. However, this policy can lead users to migrate to alternative\nfringe platforms with lower moderation standards and where antisocial behaviors\nlike trolling and harassment are widely accepted. As users of these communities\noften remain \\ca across mainstream and fringe platforms, antisocial behaviors\nmay spill over onto the mainstream platform. We study this possible spillover\nby analyzing around $70,000$ users from three banned communities that migrated\nto fringe platforms: r/The\\_Donald, r/GenderCritical, and r/Incels. Using a\ndifference-in-differences design, we contrast \\ca users with matched\ncounterparts to estimate the causal effect of fringe platform participation on\nusers' antisocial behavior on Reddit. Our results show that participating in\nthe fringe communities increases users' toxicity on Reddit (as measured by\nPerspective API) and involvement with subreddits similar to the banned\ncommunity -- which often also breach platform norms. The effect intensifies\nwith time and exposure to the fringe platform. In short, we find evidence for a\nspillover of antisocial behavior from fringe platforms onto Reddit via\nco-participation.",

Therefore, this study attempts to\nalleviate this shortcoming by proposing three different approaches based on\ncombination of GAN models at two different levels that tries to reduce the\nfeature distribution gap between day-time and night-time infrared images.\nQuantitative analysis to compare the performance of the proposed models with\nthe state-of-the-art models have been done by testing the models using\nstate-of-the-art object detection models.

    "abstract": "Chronic pain is a pervasive disorder which is often very disabling and is\nassociated with comorbidities such as depression and anxiety. Neuropathic Pain\n(NP) is a common sub-type which is often caused due to nerve damage and has a\nknown pathophysiology. Another common sub-type is Fibromyalgia (FM) which is\ndescribed as musculoskeletal, diffuse pain that is widespread through the body.\nThe pathophysiology of FM is poorly understood, making it very hard to\ndiagnose. Standard medications and treatments for FM and NP differ from one\nanother and if misdiagnosed it can cause an increase in symptom severity. To\novercome this difficulty, we propose a novel framework, PainPoints, which\naccurately detects the sub-type of pain and generates clinical notes via\nsummarizing the patient interviews. Specifically, PainPoints makes use of large\nlanguage models to perform sentence-level classification of the text obtained\nfrom interviews of FM and NP patients with a reliable AUC of 0.83. Using a\nsufficiency-based interpretability approach, we explain how the fine-tuned\nmodel accurately picks up on the nuances that patients use to describe their\npain. Finally, we generate summaries of these interviews via expert\ninterventions by introducing a novel facet-based approach.

    "abstract": "Social media platforms host discussions about a wide variety of topics that\narise everyday. Making sense of all the content and organising it into\ncategories is an arduous task. A common way to deal with this issue is relying\non topic modeling, but topics discovered using this technique are difficult to\ninterpret and can differ from corpus to corpus. In this paper, we present a new\ntask based on tweet topic classification and release two associated datasets.\nGiven a wide range of topics covering the most important discussion points in\nsocial media, we provide training and testing data from recent time periods\nthat can be used to evaluate tweet classification models. Moreover, we perform\na quantitative evaluation and analysis of current general- and domain-specific\nlanguage models on the task, which provide more insights on the challenges and\nnature of the task.",

    "abstract": "Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) can be densely deployed in complex\nenvironment to create cascaded line-of-sight (LoS) paths between multiple base\nstations (BSs) and users via tunable IRS reflections, thereby significantly\nenhancing the coverage performance of wireless networks. To achieve this goal,\nit is vital to optimize the deployed locations of BSs and IRSs in the wireless\nnetwork, which is investigated in this paper. Specifically, we divide the\ncoverage area of the network into multiple non-overlapping cells and decide\nwhether to deploy a BS/IRS in each cell given a total number of BSs/IRSs\navailable. We show that to ensure the network coverage/communication\nperformance, i.e., each cell has a direct/cascaded LoS path with at least one\nBS, as well as such LoS paths have the average number of IRS reflections less\nthan a given threshold, there is a fundamental trade-off with the deployment\ncost or the number of BSs/IRSs needed. To optimally characterize this\ntrade-off, we formulate a joint BS and IRS deployment problem based on graph\ntheory, which, however, is difficult to be optimally solved due to the\ncombinatorial optimization involved. To circumvent this difficulty, we first\nconsider a simplified problem with given BS deployment and propose the optimal\nas well as an efficient suboptimal IRS deployment solution to it, by applying\nthe branch-and-bound method and iteratively removing IRSs from the candidate\nlocations, respectively. Next, an efficient sequential update algorithm is\nproposed for solving the joint BS and IRS deployment problem. Numerical results\nare provided to show the efficacy of the proposed design approach and\noptimization algorithms for the joint BS and IRS deployment. The trade-off\nbetween the network coverage performance and the number of deployed BSs/IRSs\nwith different cost ratios is also unveiled.",

    "abstract": "EMFI has become a popular fault injection (FI) technique due to its ability\nto inject faults precisely considering timing and location. Recently, ARM,\nRISC-V, and even x86 processing units in different packages were shown to be\nvulnerable to electromagnetic fault injection (EMFI) attacks. However, past\npublications lack a detailed description of the entire attack setup, hindering\nresearchers and companies from easily replicating the presented attacks on\ntheir devices. In this work, we first show how to build an automated EMFI setup\nwith high scanning resolution and good repeatability that is large enough to\nattack modern desktop and server CPUs. We structurally lay out all details on\nmechanics, hardware, and software along with this paper. Second, we use our\nsetup to attack a deeply embedded security co-processor in modern AMD systems\non a chip (SoCs), the AMD Secure Processor (AMD-SP). Using a previously\npublished code execution exploit, we run two custom payloads on the AMD-SP that\nutilize the SoC to different degrees. We then visualize these fault locations\non SoC photographs allowing us to reason about the SoC's components under\nattack. Finally, we show that the signature verification process of one of the\nfirst executed firmware parts is susceptible to EMFI attacks, undermining the\nsecurity architecture of the entire SoC.

When arguments support conflicting propositions, one of\nthe arguments must be defeated, which raises the question of \\emph{which\n(sub-)arguments can be subject to defeat}?\nIn legal argumentation, meta-rules determine the valid arguments by\nconsidering the last defeasible rule of each argument involved in a conflict.\nSince it is easier to evaluate arguments using their last rules, \\emph{can a\nconflict be resolved by considering only the last defeasible rules of the\narguments involved}?\nWe propose a new argument system where, instead of deriving a defeat relation\nbetween arguments, \\emph{undercutting-arguments} for the defeat of defeasible\nrules are constructed.

    "abstract": "Continual learning for Semantic Segmentation (CSS) is a rapidly emerging\nfield, in which the capabilities of the segmentation model are incrementally\nimproved by learning new classes or new domains. A central challenge in\nContinual Learning is overcoming the effects of catastrophic forgetting, which\nrefers to the sudden drop in accuracy on previously learned tasks after the\nmodel is trained on new classes or domains. In continual classification this\nchallenge is often overcome by replaying a small selection of samples from\nprevious tasks, however replay is rarely considered in CSS. Therefore, we\ninvestigate the influences of various replay strategies for semantic\nsegmentation and evaluate them in class- and domain-incremental settings. Our\nfindings suggest that in a class-incremental setting, it is critical to achieve\na uniform distribution for the different classes in the buffer to avoid a bias\ntowards newly learned classes. In the domain-incremental setting, it is most\neffective to select buffer samples by uniformly sampling from the distribution\nof learned feature representations or by choosing samples with median entropy.\nFinally, we observe that the effective sampling methods help to decrease the\nrepresentation shift significantly in early layers, which is a major cause of\nforgetting in domain-incremental learning.",

    "abstract": "Deep convolutional neural networks have shown remarkable performance on\nvarious computer vision tasks, and yet, they are susceptible to picking up\nspurious correlations from the training signal. So called `shortcuts' can occur\nduring learning, for example, when there are specific frequencies present in\nthe image data that correlate with the output predictions. Both high and low\nfrequencies can be characteristic of the underlying noise distribution caused\nby the image acquisition rather than in relation to the task-relevant\ninformation about the image content. Models that learn features related to this\ncharacteristic noise will not generalize well to new data.\nIn this work, we propose a simple yet effective training strategy, Frequency\nDropout, to prevent convolutional neural networks from learning\nfrequency-specific imaging features. We employ randomized filtering of feature\nmaps during training which acts as a feature-level regularization. In this\nstudy, we consider common image processing filters such as Gaussian smoothing,\nLaplacian of Gaussian, and Gabor filtering. Our training strategy is\nmodel-agnostic and can be used for any computer vision task. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of Frequency Dropout on a range of popular architectures and\nmultiple tasks including image classification, domain adaptation, and semantic\nsegmentation using both computer vision and medical imaging datasets.

Detection of solder errors during SJI is quite\nchallenging as the solder joints have very small sizes and can take various\nshapes. In this study, we first show that solders have low feature diversity,\nand that the SJI can be carried out as a fine-grained image classification task\nwhich focuses on hard-to-distinguish object classes. To improve the\nfine-grained classification accuracy, penalizing confident model predictions by\nmaximizing entropy was found useful in the literature.

We compare\nthe {\\alpha}-JS regularization with both existing entropyregularization based\nmethods and the methods based on attention mechanism, segmentation techniques,\ntransformer models, and specific loss functions for fine-grained image\nclassification tasks. We show that the proposed approach achieves the highest\nF1-score and competitive accuracy for different models in the finegrained\nsolder joint classification task.

    "abstract": "The separation between training and deployment of machine learning models\nimplies that not all scenarios encountered in deployment can be anticipated\nduring training, and therefore relying solely on advancements in training has\nits limits. Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is an important area that\nstress-tests a model's ability to handle unseen situations: Do models know when\nthey don't know? Existing OOD detection methods either incur extra training\nsteps, additional data or make nontrivial modifications to the trained network.\nIn contrast, in this work, we propose an extremely simple, post-hoc, on-the-fly\nactivation shaping method, ASH, where a large portion (e.g. 90%) of a sample's\nactivation at a late layer is removed, and the rest (e.g. 10%) simplified or\nlightly adjusted. The shaping is applied at inference time, and does not\nrequire any statistics calculated from training data. Experiments show that\nsuch a simple treatment enhances in-distribution and out-of-distribution sample\ndistinction so as to allow state-of-the-art OOD detection on ImageNet, and does\nnot noticeably deteriorate the in-distribution accuracy.

    "title": "Open-vocabulary Queryable Scene Representations for Real World Planning",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have unlocked new capabilities of task planning\nfrom human instructions. However, prior attempts to apply LLMs to real-world\nrobotic tasks are limited by the lack of grounding in the surrounding scene. In\nthis paper, we develop NLMap, an open-vocabulary and queryable scene\nrepresentation to address this problem. NLMap serves as a framework to gather\nand integrate contextual information into LLM planners, allowing them to see\nand query available objects in the scene before generating a\ncontext-conditioned plan. NLMap first establishes a natural language queryable\nscene representation with Visual Language models (VLMs). An LLM based object\nproposal module parses instructions and proposes involved objects to query the\nscene representation for object availability and location. An LLM planner then\nplans with such information about the scene. NLMap allows robots to operate\nwithout a fixed list of objects nor executable options, enabling real robot\noperation unachievable by previous methods.

For algorithms sharing the same\nstate-action set coverage with different sampling distributions, it is commonly\nbelieved that prioritizing the exploration of high-risk state-actions leads to\na better sampling efficiency. Our proposal disputes the above intuition by\nintroducing an impossibility theorem that provably shows all safety testing\nalgorithms of the aforementioned difference perform equally well with the same\nexpected sampling efficiency. Moreover, for testing algorithms covering\ndifferent sets of state-actions, the sampling efficiency criterion is no longer\napplicable as different algorithms do not necessarily converge to the same\ntermination condition. We then propose a testing aggressiveness definition\nbased on the almost safe set concept along with an unbiased and efficient\nalgorithm that compares the aggressiveness between testing algorithms.\nEmpirical observations from the safety testing of bipedal locomotion\ncontrollers and vehicle decision-making modules are also presented to support\nthe proposed theoretical implications and methodologies.",

However, many transfer techniques in\nreinforcement learning make the limiting assumption that the teacher is an\nexpert. In this paper, we use the action prior from the Reinforcement Learning\nas Inference framework - that is, a distribution over actions at each state\nwhich resembles a teacher policy, rather than a Bayesian prior - to recover\nstate-of-the-art policy distillation techniques. Then, we propose a class of\nadaptive methods that can robustly exploit action priors by combining reward\nshaping and auxiliary regularization losses. In contrast to prior work, we\ndevelop algorithms for leveraging suboptimal action priors that may\nnevertheless impart valuable knowledge - which we call soft action priors.

We perform\ntabular experiments, which show that the proposed methods achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance, surpassing it when learning from suboptimal\npriors.

Our goal is to\ndesign an attack strategy that can learn from such natural scenes by leveraging\nthe local patch differences that occur inherently in such images (e.g.\ndifference between the local patch on the object `person' and the object `bike'\nin a traffic scene). Our key idea is: to misclassify an adversarial\nmulti-object image, each local patch in the image should confuse the victim\nclassifier. Based on this, we propose a novel generative attack (called Local\nPatch Difference or LPD-Attack) where a novel contrastive loss function uses\nthe aforesaid local differences in feature space of multi-object scenes to\noptimize the perturbation generator. Through various experiments across diverse\nvictim convolutional neural networks, we show that our approach outperforms\nbaseline generative attacks with highly transferable perturbations when\nevaluated under different white-box and black-box settings.",

    "abstract": "Dating back to two famous experiments by the social-psychologist, Stanley\nMilgram, in the 1960s, the small-world phenomenon is the idea that all people\nare connected through a short chain of acquaintances that can be used to route\nmessages. Many subsequent papers have attempted to model this phenomenon, with\nmost concentrating on the \"short chain\" of acquaintances rather than their\nability to efficiently route messages. In this paper, we study the small-world\nnavigability of the U.S. road network, with the goal of providing a model that\nexplains how messages in the original small-world experiments could be routed\nalong short paths using U.S. roads. To this end, we introduce the Neighborhood\nPreferential Attachment model, which combines elements from Kleinberg's model\nand the Barab\\'asi-Albert model, such that long-range links are chosen\naccording to both the degrees and (road-network) distances of vertices in the\nnetwork. We empirically evaluate all three models by running a decentralized\nrouting algorithm, where each vertex only has knowledge of its own neighbors,\nand find that our model outperforms both of these models in terms of the\naverage hop length. Moreover, our experiments indicate that similar to the\nBarab\\'asi-Albert model, networks generated by our model are scale-free, which\ncould be a more realistic representation of acquaintanceship links in the\noriginal small-world experiment.",

    "abstract": "Discriminator plays a vital role in training generative adversarial networks\n(GANs) via distinguishing real and synthesized samples. While the real data\ndistribution remains the same, the synthesis distribution keeps varying because\nof the evolving generator, and thus effects a corresponding change to the\nbi-classification task for the discriminator. We argue that a discriminator\nwith an on-the-fly adjustment on its capacity can better accommodate such a\ntime-varying task. A comprehensive empirical study confirms that the proposed\ntraining strategy, termed as DynamicD, improves the synthesis performance\nwithout incurring any additional computation cost or training objectives. Two\ncapacity adjusting schemes are developed for training GANs under different data\nregimes: i) given a sufficient amount of training data, the discriminator\nbenefits from a progressively increased learning capacity, and ii) when the\ntraining data is limited, gradually decreasing the layer width mitigates the\nover-fitting issue of the discriminator. Experiments on both 2D and 3D-aware\nimage synthesis tasks conducted on a range of datasets substantiate the\ngeneralizability of our DynamicD as well as its substantial improvement over\nthe baselines. Furthermore, DynamicD is synergistic to other\ndiscriminator-improving approaches (including data augmentation, regularizers,\nand pre-training), and brings continuous performance gain when combined for\nlearning GANs.",

    "abstract": "High-quality HDRIs(High Dynamic Range Images), typically HDR panoramas, are\none of the most popular ways to create photorealistic lighting and 360-degree\nreflections of 3D scenes in graphics. Given the difficulty of capturing HDRIs,\na versatile and controllable generative model is highly desired, where layman\nusers can intuitively control the generation process. However, existing\nstate-of-the-art methods still struggle to synthesize high-quality panoramas\nfor complex scenes. In this work, we propose a zero-shot text-driven framework,\nText2Light, to generate 4K+ resolution HDRIs without paired training data.\nGiven a free-form text as the description of the scene, we synthesize the\ncorresponding HDRI with two dedicated steps: 1) text-driven panorama generation\nin low dynamic range(LDR) and low resolution, and 2) super-resolution inverse\ntone mapping to scale up the LDR panorama both in resolution and dynamic range.\nSpecifically, to achieve zero-shot text-driven panorama generation, we first\nbuild dual codebooks as the discrete representation for diverse environmental\ntextures. Then, driven by the pre-trained CLIP model, a text-conditioned global\nsampler learns to sample holistic semantics from the global codebook according\nto the input text. Furthermore, a structure-aware local sampler learns to\nsynthesize LDR panoramas patch-by-patch, guided by holistic semantics. To\nachieve super-resolution inverse tone mapping, we derive a continuous\nrepresentation of 360-degree imaging from the LDR panorama as a set of\nstructured latent codes anchored to the sphere. This continuous representation\nenables a versatile module to upscale the resolution and dynamic range\nsimultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior capability of\nText2Light in generating high-quality HDR panoramas.

However, obtaining accurate high-dimensional channel\nstate information (CSI) with limited pilot and feedback signaling overhead is\nchallenging, severely degrading the performance of conventional spatial\ndivision multiple access. To improve the robustness against CSI imperfection,\nthis paper proposes a deep learning (DL)-based rate-splitting multiple access\n(RSMA) scheme for RIS-aided Tera-Hertz multi-user MIMO systems. Specifically,\nwe first propose a hybrid data-model driven DL-based RSMA precoding scheme,\nincluding the passive precoding at the RIS as well as the analog active\nprecoding and the RSMA digital active precoding at the base station (BS). To\nrealize the passive precoding at the RIS, we propose a Transformer-based\ndata-driven RIS reflecting network (RRN). As for the analog active precoding at\nthe BS, we propose a match-filter based analog precoding scheme considering\nthat the BS and RIS adopt the LoS-MIMO antenna array architecture. As for the\nRSMA digital active precoding at the BS, we propose a low-complexity\napproximate weighted minimum mean square error (AWMMSE) digital precoding\nscheme. Furthermore, for better precoding performance as well as lower\ncomputational complexity, a model-driven deep unfolding active precoding\nnetwork (DFAPN) is also designed by combining the proposed AWMMSE scheme with\nDL. Then, to acquire accurate CSI at the BS for the investigated RSMA precoding\nscheme to achieve higher spectral efficiency, we propose a CSI acquisition\nnetwork (CAN) with low pilot and feedback signaling overhead, where the\ndownlink pilot transmission, CSI feedback at the user equipments (UEs), and CSI\nreconstruction at the BS are modeled as an end-to-end neural network based on\nTransformer.",

    "title": "Space-time tradeoffs of lenses and optics via higher category theory",
    "abstract": "Optics and lenses are abstract categorical gadgets that model systems with\nbidirectional data flow. In this paper we observe that the denotational\ndefinition of optics - identifying two optics as equivalent by observing their\nbehaviour from the outside - is not suitable for operational, software oriented\napproaches where optics are not merely observed, but built with their internal\nsetups in mind. We identify operational differences between denotationally\nisomorphic categories of cartesian optics and lenses: their different\ncomposition rule and corresponding space-time tradeoffs, positioning them at\ntwo opposite ends of a spectrum. With these motivations we lift the existing\ncategorical constructions and their relationships to the 2-categorical level,\nshowing that the relevant operational concerns become visible. We define the\n2-category $\\textbf{2-Optic}(\\mathcal{C})$ whose 2-cells explicitly track\noptics' internal configuration. We show that the 1-category\n$\\textbf{Optic}(\\mathcal{C})$ arises by locally quotienting out the connected\ncomponents of this 2-category. We show that the embedding of lenses into\ncartesian optics gets weakened from a functor to an oplax functor whose\noplaxator now detects the different composition rule. We determine the\ndifficulties in showing this functor forms a part of an adjunction in any of\nthe standard 2-categories. We establish a conjecture that the well-known\nisomorphism between cartesian lenses and optics arises out of the lax\n2-adjunction between their double-categorical counterparts. In addition to\npresenting new research, this paper is also meant to be an accessible\nintroduction to the topic.",

We propose an\noptimization model that explicitly considers a sampled subset of followers and\nexploits a machine learning model to estimate the objective values of unsampled\nfollowers. Unlike existing approaches, we embed machine learning model training\ninto the optimization problem, which allows us to employ general follower\nfeatures that can not be represented using leader decisions. We prove bounds on\nthe optimality gap of the generated leader decision as measured by the original\nobjective function that considers the full follower set. We then develop\nfollower sampling algorithms to tighten the bounds and a representation\nlearning approach to learn follower features, which can be used as inputs to\nthe embedded machine learning model. Using synthetic instances of a cycling\nnetwork design problem, we compare the computational performance of our\napproach versus baseline methods. Our approach provides more accurate\npredictions for follower objective values, and more importantly, generates\nleader decisions of higher quality.

Synapse weights are found using Grover's\nalgorithm with a modified oracle function. The results of running these\nparametrically synthesized circuits for training perceptrons of three different\ntopologies are described. The circuits were run on a 100-qubit IBM quantum\nsimulator. The synthesis of quantum circuits is carried out using quantum\nsynthesizer \"Naginata\", which was developed in the scope of this work, the\nsource code of which is published and further documented on GitHub. The article\ndescribes the quantum circuit synthesis algorithm for training single-layer\nperceptrons. At the moment, quantum circuits are created mainly by manually\nplacing logic elements on lines that symbolize quantum bits. The purpose of\ncreating Quantum Circuit Synthesizer \"Naginata\" was due to the fact that even\nwith a slight increase in the number of operations in a quantum algorithm,\nleads to the significant increase in size of the corresponding quantum circuit.\nThis causes serious difficulties both in creating and debugging these quantum\ncircuits. The purpose of our quantum synthesizer is enabling users an\nopportunity to implement quantum algorithms using higher-level commands. This\nis achieved by creating generic blocks for frequently used operations such as:\nthe adder, multiplier, digital comparator (comparison operator), etc. Thus, the\nuser could implement a quantum algorithm by using these generic blocks, and the\nquantum synthesizer would create a suitable circuit for this algorithm, in a\nformat that is supported by the chosen quantum computation environment.

    "abstract": "The study of the retinal vasculature is a fundamental stage in the screening\nand diagnosis of many diseases. A complete retinal vascular analysis requires\nto segment and classify the blood vessels of the retina into arteries and veins\n(A/V). Early automatic methods approached these segmentation and classification\ntasks in two sequential stages. However, currently, these tasks are approached\nas a joint semantic segmentation task, as the classification results highly\ndepend on the effectiveness of the vessel segmentation. In that regard, we\npropose a novel approach for the simultaneous segmentation and classification\nof the retinal A/V from eye fundus images. In particular, we propose a novel\nmethod that, unlike previous approaches, and thanks to a novel loss, decomposes\nthe joint task into three segmentation problems targeting arteries, veins and\nthe whole vascular tree. This configuration allows to handle vessel crossings\nintuitively and directly provides accurate segmentation masks of the different\ntarget vascular trees. The provided ablation study on the public Retinal Images\nvessel Tree Extraction (RITE) dataset demonstrates that the proposed method\nprovides a satisfactory performance, particularly in the segmentation of the\ndifferent structures. Furthermore, the comparison with the state of the art\nshows that our method achieves highly competitive results in A/V\nclassification, while significantly improving vascular segmentation. The\nproposed multi-segmentation method allows to detect more vessels and better\nsegment the different structures, while achieving a competitive classification\nperformance. Also, in these terms, our approach outperforms the approaches of\nvarious reference works. Moreover, in contrast with previous approaches, the\nproposed method allows to directly detect the vessel crossings, as well as\npreserving the continuity of A/V at these complex locations.",

    "abstract": "Most artificial intelligence (AI) research have concentrated in high-income\ncountries, where imaging data, IT infrastructures and clinical expertise are\nplentiful. However, slower progress has been made in limited-resource\nenvironments where medical imaging is needed. For example, in Sub-Saharan\nAfrica the rate of perinatal mortality is very high due to limited access to\nantenatal screening. In these countries, AI models could be implemented to help\nclinicians acquire fetal ultrasound planes for diagnosis of fetal\nabnormalities. So far, deep learning models have been proposed to identify\nstandard fetal planes, but there is no evidence of their ability to generalise\nin centres with limited access to high-end ultrasound equipment and data. This\nwork investigates different strategies to reduce the domain-shift effect for a\nfetal plane classification model trained on a high-resource clinical centre and\ntransferred to a new low-resource centre. To that end, a classifier trained\nwith 1,792 patients from Spain is first evaluated on a new centre in Denmark in\noptimal conditions with 1,008 patients and is later optimised to reach the same\nperformance in five African centres (Egypt, Algeria, Uganda, Ghana and Malawi)\nwith 25 patients each. The results show that a transfer learning approach can\nbe a solution to integrate small-size African samples with existing large-scale\ndatabases in developed countries. In particular, the model can be re-aligned\nand optimised to boost the performance on African populations by increasing the\nrecall to $0.92 \\pm 0.04$ and at the same time maintaining a high precision\nacross centres. This framework shows promise for building new AI models\ngeneralisable across clinical centres with limited data acquired in challenging\nand heterogeneous conditions and calls for further research to develop new\nsolutions for usability of AI in countries with less resources.",

Since sediments and vegetation interact\ncomplexly, predicting sediment transport rates is challenging. This study aims\nto predict sediment transport rate under vegetation cover using new and\noptimized versions of the group method of data handling (GMDH). Additionally,\nthis study introduces a new ensemble model for predicting sediment transport\nrates. Model inputs include wave height, wave velocity, density cover, wave\nforce, D50, the height of vegetation cover, and cover stem diameter. A\nstandalone GMDH model and optimized GMDH models, including GMDH honey badger\nalgorithm (HBA) GMDH rat swarm algorithm (RSOA)vGMDH sine cosine algorithm\n(SCA), and GMDH particle swarm optimization (GMDH-PSO), were used to predict\nsediment transport rates. As the next step, the outputs of standalone and\noptimized GMDH were used to construct an ensemble model. The MAE of the\nensemble model was 0.145 m3/s, while the MAEs of GMDH-HBA, GMDH-RSOA, GMDH-SCA,\nGMDH-PSOA, and GMDH in the testing level were 0.176 m3/s, 0.312 m3/s, 0.367\nm3/s, 0.498 m3/s, and 0.612 m3/s, respectively. The Nash Sutcliffe coefficient\n(NSE) of ensemble model, GMDH-HBA, GMDH-RSOA, GMDH-SCA, GMDH-PSOA, and GHMDH\nwere 0.95 0.93, 0.89, 0.86, 0.82, and 0.76, respectively. Additionally, this\nstudy demonstrated that vegetation cover decreased sediment transport rate by\n90 percent. The results indicated that the ensemble and GMDH-HBA models could\naccurately predict sediment transport rates. Based on the results of this\nstudy, sediment transport rate can be monitored using the IMM and GMDH-HBA.\nThese results are useful for managing and planning water resources in large\nbasins.",

    "abstract": "Predicting fund performance is beneficial to both investors and fund\nmanagers, and yet is a challenging task. In this paper, we have tested whether\ndeep learning models can predict fund performance more accurately than\ntraditional statistical techniques. Fund performance is typically evaluated by\nthe Sharpe ratio, which represents the risk-adjusted performance to ensure\nmeaningful comparability across funds. We calculated the annualised Sharpe\nratios based on the monthly returns time series data for more than 600 open-end\nmutual funds investing in listed large-cap equities in the United States. We\nfind that long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent units (GRUs) deep\nlearning methods, both trained with modern Bayesian optimization, provide\nhigher accuracy in forecasting funds' Sharpe ratios than traditional\nstatistical ones. An ensemble method, which combines forecasts from LSTM and\nGRUs, achieves the best performance of all models. There is evidence to say\nthat deep learning and ensembling offer promising solutions in addressing the\nchallenge of fund performance forecasting.",

    "abstract": "Efficient global optimization is a widely used method for optimizing\nexpensive black-box functions such as tuning hyperparameter, and designing new\nmaterial, etc. Despite its popularity, less attention has been paid to\nanalyzing the inherent hardness of the problem although, given its extensive\nuse, it is important to understand the fundamental limits of efficient global\noptimization algorithms. In this paper, we study the worst-case complexity of\nthe efficient global optimization problem and, in contrast to existing\nkernel-specific results, we derive a unified lower bound for the complexity of\nefficient global optimization in terms of the metric entropy of a ball in its\ncorresponding reproducing kernel Hilbert space~(RKHS). Specifically, we show\nthat if there exists a deterministic algorithm that achieves suboptimality gap\nsmaller than $\\epsilon$ for any function $f\\in S$ in $T$ function evaluations,\nit is necessary that $T$ is at least\n$\\Omega\\left(\\frac{\\log\\mathcal{N}(S(\\mathcal{X}),\n4\\epsilon,\\|\\cdot\\|_\\infty)}{\\log(\\frac{R}{\\epsilon})}\\right)$, where\n$\\mathcal{N}(\\cdot,\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is the covering number, $S$ is the ball\ncentered at $0$ with radius $R$ in the RKHS and $S(\\mathcal{X})$ is the\nrestriction of $S$ over the feasible set $\\mathcal{X}$. Moreover, we show that\nthis lower bound nearly matches the upper bound attained by non-adaptive search\nalgorithms for the commonly used squared exponential kernel and the Mat\\'ern\nkernel with a large smoothness parameter $\\nu$, up to a replacement of $d/2$ by\n$d$ and a logarithmic term $\\log\\frac{R}{\\epsilon}$. That is to say, our lower\nbound is nearly optimal for these kernels.",

In cardiovascular magnetic\nresonance imaging (CMR), respiratory motion represents a major challenge in\nterms of acquisition quality and therefore subsequent analysis and final\ndiagnosis. We present a workflow which predicts a severity score for\nrespiratory motion in CMR for the CMRxMotion challenge 2022. This is an\nimportant tool for technicians to immediately provide feedback on the CMR\nquality during acquisition, as poor-quality images can directly be re-acquired\nwhile the patient is still available in the vicinity. Thus, our method ensures\nthat the acquired CMR holds up to a specific quality standard before it is used\nfor further diagnosis. Therefore, it enables an efficient base for proper\ndiagnosis without having time and cost-intensive re-acquisitions in cases of\nsevere motion artefacts. Combined with our segmentation model, this can help\ncardiologists and technicians in their daily routine by providing a complete\npipeline to guarantee proper quality assessment and genuine segmentations for\ncardiovascular scans.
