    "abstract": "The article proposes a universal dual-axis intelligent systems assessment\nscale. The scale considers the properties of intelligent systems within the\nenvironmental context, which develops over time. In contrast to the frequent\nconsideration of the 'mind' of artificial intelligent systems on a scale from\n'weak' to 'strong', we highlight the modulating influences of anticipatory\nability on their 'brute force'. In addition, the complexity, the 'weight' of\nthe cognitive task and the ability to critically assess it beforehand determine\nthe actual set of cognitive tools, the use of which provides the best result in\nthese conditions. In fact, the presence of 'common sense' options is what\nconnects the ability to solve a problem with the correct use of such an ability\nitself. The degree of 'correctness' and 'adequacy' is determined by the\ncombination of a suitable solution with the temporal characteristics of the\nevent, phenomenon, object or subject under study.",

To this end, anomaly detection algorithms are used to compute a\nroutine and a peculiarity anomaly score for each trip a vehicle makes.

    "abstract": "Finding claims that researchers have made considerable progress in artificial\nintelligence over the last several decades is easy. However, our everyday\ninteractions with cognitive systems quickly move from intriguing to\nfrustrating. The root of those frustrations rests in a mismatch between the\nexpectations we have due to our inherent, folk-psychological theories and the\nreal limitations we see in existing computer programs. To address the\ndiscordance, we find ourselves building mental models of how each unique tool\nworks: how we address Apple's Siri may differ from how we address Amazon's\nAlexa, the prompts that create striking images in Midjourney may produce\nunsatisfactory renderings in OpenAI's DALL-E. Emphasizing intentionality in\nresearch on cognitive systems provides a way to reduce these discrepancies,\nbringing system behavior closer to folk psychology. This paper scrutinizes the\npropositional attitude of intention to clarify this claim. That analysis is\njoined with broad methodological suggestions informed by recent practices\nwithin large-scale research programs. The overall goal is to identify a novel\napproach for measuring and making progress in artificial intelligence.",

A multistage imputation strategy and dynamic\ndata length are introduced into the imputation process for data periods.\nExperimental results on different types of sensor data show that the multistage\nimputation strategy and the mixture index are superior and that the effect of\nmissing value imputation has been improved to some extent, particularly for the\nlarge segment imputation problem.

This leads to the need to adopt new systems in both commercial\nand non-commercial environments: smart doors. In particular, a smart door\nsystem predicts the intention of people near the door based on the social\ncontext of the surrounding environment and then makes rational decisions about\nwhether or not to open the door. This work proposes the first position paper\nrelated to smart doors, without bells and whistles.

Indeed, a system to predict the intention of people near the door\nalso involves a deeper understanding of the social context of the scene through\na complex combined analysis of proxemics and scene reasoning.

In this paper, we first propose a deep\nreinforcement learning framework for multi-agent cooperative exploration in\nenvironments with sparse landmarks while reducing client-server communication.\nBy leveraging recent development on partial observability and credit\nassignment, our framework can train the exploration policy efficiently for\nmulti-robot systems. The policy receives individual rewards from actions based\non a proximity sensor with limited range and resolution, which is combined with\ngroup rewards to encourage collaborative exploration and construction of the\nLandmark Complex through observation of 0-, 1- and 2-dimensional simplices. In\naddition, we employ a three-stage curriculum learning strategy to mitigate the\nreward sparsity by gradually adding random obstacles and destroying random\nlandmarks.

    "abstract": "Learning a fast and discriminative patch descriptor is a challenging topic in\ncomputer vision. Recently, many existing works focus on training various\ndescriptor learning networks by minimizing a triplet loss (or its variants),\nwhich is expected to decrease the distance between each positive pair and\nincrease the distance between each negative pair. However, such an expectation\nhas to be lowered due to the non-perfect convergence of network optimizer to a\nlocal solution. Addressing this problem and the open computational speed\nproblem, we propose a Descriptor Distillation framework for local descriptor\nlearning, called DesDis, where a student model gains knowledge from a\npre-trained teacher model, and it is further enhanced via a designed\nteacher-student regularizer. This teacher-student regularizer is to constrain\nthe difference between the positive (also negative) pair similarity from the\nteacher model and that from the student model, and we theoretically prove that\na more effective student model could be trained by minimizing a weighted\ncombination of the triplet loss and this regularizer, than its teacher which is\ntrained by minimizing the triplet loss singly. Under the proposed DesDis, many\nexisting descriptor networks could be embedded as the teacher model, and\naccordingly, both equal-weight and light-weight student models could be\nderived, which outperform their teacher in either accuracy or speed.\nExperimental results on 3 public datasets demonstrate that the equal-weight\nstudent models, derived from the proposed DesDis framework by utilizing three\ntypical descriptor learning networks as teacher models, could achieve\nsignificantly better performances than their teachers and several other\ncomparative methods. In addition, the derived light-weight models could achieve\n8 times or even faster speeds than the comparative methods under similar patch\nverification performances",

We also closely tracked COVID-19 policies across\ncounties of residence throughout the study period. Such a dataset allows\nimportant research questions to be answered; for example, to determine the\nfactors underlying the heterogeneous behavioral responses to COVID-19\nrestrictions imposed by local governments. Better information about such\nresponses is critical to our ability to understand the societal and economic\nimpacts of this and future pandemics. The development of this data\ninfrastructure can also help researchers explore new frontiers in behavioral\nscience. The article explains how this approach fills gaps in COVID-19 related\ndata collection; describes the study design and data collection procedures;\npresents key demographic characteristics of study participants; and shows how\nfusing different data streams helps uncover behavioral insights.",

    "title": "Periodic Graph Transformers for Crystal Material Property Prediction",
    "abstract": "We consider representation learning on periodic graphs encoding crystal\nmaterials. Different from regular graphs, periodic graphs consist of a minimum\nunit cell repeating itself on a regular lattice in 3D space. How to effectively\nencode these periodic structures poses unique challenges not present in regular\ngraph representation learning. In addition to being E(3) invariant, periodic\ngraph representations need to be periodic invariant. That is, the learned\nrepresentations should be invariant to shifts of cell boundaries as they are\nartificially imposed. Furthermore, the periodic repeating patterns need to be\ncaptured explicitly as lattices of different sizes and orientations may\ncorrespond to different materials. In this work, we propose a transformer\narchitecture, known as Matformer, for periodic graph representation learning.\nOur Matformer is designed to be invariant to periodicity and can capture\nrepeating patterns explicitly. In particular, Matformer encodes periodic\npatterns by efficient use of geometric distances between the same atoms in\nneighboring cells. Experimental results on multiple common benchmark datasets\nshow that our Matformer outperforms baseline methods consistently. In addition,\nour results demonstrate the importance of periodic invariance and explicit\nrepeating pattern encoding for crystal representation learning.",

In order to demonstrate\nricher behaviors on the manifold of rotations, both the planning and feedback\nlayers must be done in a geometrically consistent fashion; therefore, we\ndevelop the necessary tools to employ Lie group integrators and an appropriate\nfeedback controller.

However, they show limited scalability on\nlarge-scale industrial datasets since most models learn one embedding per item.\nThis leads to a large memory requirement (of storing one vector per item) and\npoor performance on sparse sessions with cold-start or unpopular items. Using\none public and one large industrial dataset, we experimentally show that\nstate-of-the-art SBRSs have low performance on sparse sessions with sparse\nitems. We propose M2TRec, a Metadata-aware Multi-task Transformer model for\nsession-based recommendations. Our proposed method learns a transformation\nfunction from item metadata to embeddings, and is thus, item-ID free (i.e.,\ndoes not need to learn one embedding per item). It integrates item metadata to\nlearn shared representations of diverse item attributes. During inference, new\nor unpopular items will be assigned identical representations for the\nattributes they share with items previously observed during training, and thus\nwill have similar representations with those items, enabling recommendations of\neven cold-start and sparse items. Additionally, M2TRec is trained in a\nmulti-task setting to predict the next item in the session along with its\nprimary category and subcategories. Our multi-task strategy makes the model\nconverge faster and significantly improves the overall performance.\nExperimental results show significant performance gains using our proposed\napproach on sparse items on the two datasets.",

One solution is developing online moderation tools\nusing Machine Learning techniques. However, the processing of user data by\nonline platforms requires compliance with privacy policies. Federated Learning\n(FL) is an ML paradigm where the training is performed locally on the users'\ndevices. Although the FL framework complies, in theory, with the GDPR policies,\nprivacy leaks can still occur. For instance, an attacker accessing the final\ntrained model can successfully perform unwanted inference of the data belonging\nto the users who participated in the training process. In this paper, we\npropose a privacy-preserving FL framework for online content moderation that\nincorporates Differential Privacy (DP). To demonstrate the feasibility of our\napproach, we focus on detecting harmful content on Twitter - but the overall\nconcept can be generalized to other types of misbehavior. We simulate a text\nclassifier - in FL fashion - which can detect tweets with harmful content. We\nshow that the performance of the proposed FL framework can be close to the\ncentralized approach - for both the DP and non-DP FL versions. Moreover, it has\na high performance even if a small number of clients (each with a small number\nof data points) are available for the FL training. When reducing the number of\nclients (from 50 to 10) or the data points per client (from 1K to 0.1K), the\nclassifier can still achieve ~81% AUC. Furthermore, we extend the evaluation to\nfour other Twitter datasets that capture different types of user misbehavior\nand still obtain a promising performance (61% - 80% AUC). Finally, we explore\nthe overhead on the users' devices during the FL training phase and show that\nthe local training does not introduce excessive CPU utilization and memory\nconsumption overhead.",

    "title": "Wide-Area Geolocalization with a Limited Field of View Camera",
    "abstract": "Cross-view geolocalization, a supplement or replacement for GPS, localizes an\nagent within a search area by matching images taken from a ground-view camera\nto overhead images taken from satellites or aircraft. Although the viewpoint\ndisparity between ground and overhead images makes cross-view geolocalization\nchallenging, significant progress has been made assuming that the ground agent\nhas access to a panoramic camera. For example, our prior work (WAG) introduced\nchanges in search area discretization, training loss, and particle filter\nweighting that enabled city-scale panoramic cross-view geolocalization.\nHowever, panoramic cameras are not widely used in existing robotic platforms\ndue to their complexity and cost. Non-panoramic cross-view geolocalization is\nmore applicable for robotics, but is also more challenging. This paper presents\nRestricted FOV Wide-Area Geolocalization (ReWAG), a cross-view geolocalization\napproach that generalizes WAG for use with standard, non-panoramic ground\ncameras by creating pose-aware embeddings and providing a strategy to\nincorporate particle pose into the Siamese network. ReWAG is a neural network\nand particle filter system that is able to globally localize a mobile agent in\na GPS-denied environment with only odometry and a 90 degree FOV camera,\nachieving similar localization accuracy as what WAG achieved with a panoramic\ncamera and improving localization accuracy by a factor of 100 compared to a\nbaseline vision transformer (ViT) approach. A video highlight that demonstrates\nReWAG's convergence on a test path of several dozen kilometers is available at\nhttps://youtu.be/U_OBQrt8qCE.",

    "abstract": "Whether it is in the form of transcribed conversations, blog posts, or\ntweets, qualitative data provides a reader with rich insight into both the\noverarching trends as well as the diversity of human ideas expressed through\ntext. Handling and analyzing large amounts of qualitative data, however, is\ndifficult, often requiring multiple time-intensive perusals in order to\nidentify patterns. This difficulty is multiplied with each additional question\nor time point present in a data set. A primary challenge then is creating\nvisualizations that support the interpretation of qualitative data by making it\neasier to identify and explore trends of interest. By combining the affordances\nof both text and visualizations, WordStream has previously enabled ease of\ninformation retrieval and processing of time-series text data, but the\ndata-wrangling necessary to produce a WordStream remains a significant barrier\nfor non-technical users. In response, this paper presents WordStream Maker: an\nend-to-end platform with a pipeline that utilizes natural language processing\n(NLP) to help non-technical users process raw text data and generate a\ncustomizable visualization without programming practice. Lessons learned from\nintegrating NLP into visualization and scaling to large data sets are\ndiscussed, along with use cases to demonstrate the usefulness of the platform.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical systems naturally evolve on principal bundles describing their\ninherent symmetries. The ensuing factorization of the configuration manifold\ninto a symmetry group and an internal shape space has provided deep insights\ninto the locomotion of many robotic and biological systems. On the other hand,\nthe property of differential flatness has enabled efficient, effective planning\nand control algorithms for various robotic systems. Yet, a practical means of\nfinding a flat output for an arbitrary robotic system remains an open question.\nIn this work, we demonstrate surprising new connections between these two\ndomains, for the first time employing symmetry directly to construct a flat\noutput. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence of a trivialization\nof the bundle in which the group variables themselves are a flat output. We\ncall this a geometric flat output, since it is equivariant (i.e. maintains the\nsymmetry) and is often global or almost-global, properties not typically\nenjoyed by other flat outputs. In such a trivialization, the motion planning\nproblem is easily solved, since a given trajectory for the group variables will\nfully determine the trajectory for the shape variables that exactly achieves\nthis motion. We provide a partial catalog of robotic systems with geometric\nflat outputs and worked examples for the planar rocket, planar aerial\nmanipulator, and quadrotor.",

Instead of formulating nonlinear MPC problems, we devise linear MPC\nproblems using kinematic and dynamic models linearized along nominal\ntrajectories produced by hierarchical controllers. These linear MPC problems\nare solvable via the use of Quadratic Programming; therefore, we significantly\nreduce the computation time of the proposed MPC framework so the resulting\nupdate frequency is higher than 1 kHz. Our proposed MPC framework is more\nefficient in reducing task tracking errors than a baseline based on operational\nspace control (OSC).

Here, grounded on recent theory for Hebbian learning in soft\nwinner-take-all networks, we present multilayer SoftHebb, i.e. an algorithm\nthat trains deep neural networks, without any feedback, target, or error\nsignals. As a result, it achieves efficiency by avoiding weight transport,\nnon-local plasticity, time-locking of layer updates, iterative equilibria, and\n(self-) supervisory or other feedback signals -- which were necessary in other\napproaches. Its increased efficiency and biological compatibility do not trade\noff accuracy compared to state-of-the-art bio-plausible learning, but rather\nimprove it. With up to five hidden layers and an added linear classifier,\naccuracies on MNIST, CIFAR-10, STL-10, and ImageNet, respectively reach 99.4%,\n80.3%, 76.2%, and 27.3%.

We leverage the pseudo-inverse\noperator used in DDRM and generalize this concept for other measurement\noperators, which allows us to use pre-trained unconditional diffusion models\nfor applications such as JPEG artifact correction. We empirically demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our approach across various quality factors, attaining\nperformance levels that are on par with state-of-the-art methods trained\nspecifically for the JPEG restoration task.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks trained for predicting cellular events from DNA sequence\nhave become emerging tools to help elucidate the biological mechanism\nunderlying the associations identified in genome-wide association studies. To\nenhance the training, multi-task learning (MTL) has been commonly exploited in\nprevious works where trained networks were needed for multiple profiles\ndiffering in either event modality or cell type. All existing works adopted a\nsimple MTL framework where all tasks share a single feature extraction network.\nSuch a strategy even though effective to certain extent leads to substantial\nnegative transfer, meaning the existence of large portion of tasks for which\nmodels obtained through MTL perform worse than those by single task learning.\nThere have been methods developed to address such negative transfer in other\ndomains, such as computer vision. However, these methods are generally\ndifficult to scale up to handle large amount of tasks. In this paper, we\npropose a highly scalable task grouping framework to address negative transfer\nby only jointly training tasks that are potentially beneficial to each other.\nThe proposed method exploits the network weights associated with task specific\nclassification heads that can be cheaply obtained by one-time joint training of\nall tasks.

    "abstract": "In Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), Loop Closure Detection (LCD)\nis essential to minimize drift when recognizing previously visited places.\nVisual Bag-of-Words (vBoW) has been an LCD algorithm of choice for many\nstate-of-the-art SLAM systems. It uses a set of visual features to provide\nrobust place recognition but fails to perceive the semantics or spatial\nrelationship between feature points. Previous work has mainly focused on\naddressing these issues by combining vBoW with semantic and spatial information\nfrom objects in the scene. However, they are unable to exploit spatial\ninformation of local visual features and lack a structure that unifies semantic\nobjects and visual features, therefore limiting the symbiosis between the two\ncomponents. This paper proposes SymbioLCD2, which creates a unified graph\nstructure to integrate semantic objects and visual features symbiotically. Our\nnovel graph-based LCD system utilizes the unified graph structure by applying a\nWeisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel with temporal constraints to robustly predict\nloop closure candidates. Evaluation of the proposed system shows that having a\nunified graph structure incorporating semantic objects and visual features\nimproves LCD prediction accuracy, illustrating that the proposed graph\nstructure provides a strong symbiosis between these two complementary\ncomponents. It also outperforms other Machine Learning algorithms - such as\nSVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Neural Network and GNN based Graph Matching\nNetworks.

Despite its high inference accuracy and\nperformance on cloud, maintaining data privacy in GCN inference, which is of\nparamount importance to these practical applications, remains largely\nunexplored. In this paper, we take an initial attempt towards this and develop\n$\\textit{CryptoGCN}$--a homomorphic encryption (HE) based GCN inference\nframework. A key to the success of our approach is to reduce the tremendous\ncomputational overhead for HE operations, which can be orders of magnitude\nhigher than its counterparts in the plaintext space. To this end, we develop an\napproach that can effectively take advantage of the sparsity of matrix\noperations in GCN inference to significantly reduce the computational overhead.\nSpecifically, we propose a novel AMA data formatting method and associated\nspatial convolution methods, which can exploit the complex graph structure and\nperform efficient matrix-matrix multiplication in HE computation and thus\ngreatly reduce the HE operations. We also develop a co-optimization framework\nthat can explore the trade offs among the accuracy, security level, and\ncomputational overhead by judicious pruning and polynomial approximation of\nactivation module in GCNs. Based on the NTU-XVIEW skeleton joint dataset, i.e.,\nthe largest dataset evaluated homomorphically by far as we are aware of, our\nexperimental results demonstrate that $\\textit{CryptoGCN}$ outperforms\nstate-of-the-art solutions in terms of the latency and number of homomorphic\noperations, i.e., achieving as much as a 3.10$\\times$ speedup on latency and\nreduces the total Homomorphic Operation Count by 77.4\\% with a small accuracy\nloss of 1-1.5$\\%$.",

Very\nrecently, a few studies on sub-band based speech enhancement have been\nproposed. By enhancing speech via operations on sub-band spectrograms, those\nstudies demonstrated competitive performances on the benchmark dataset of\nDNS2020. Despite attractive, this new research direction has not been fully\nexplored and there is still room for improvement. As such, in this study, we\ndelve into the latest research direction and propose a sub-band based speech\nenhancement system with perceptually-motivated optimization and dual\ntransformations, called PT-FSE. Specially, our proposed PT-FSE model improves\nits backbone, a full-band and sub-band fusion model, by three efforts. First,\nwe design a frequency transformation module that aims to strengthen the global\nfrequency correlation. Then a temporal transformation is introduced to capture\nlong range temporal contexts. Lastly, a novel loss, with leverage of properties\nof human auditory perception, is proposed to facilitate the model to focus on\nlow frequency enhancement. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed model,\nextensive experiments are conducted on the DNS2020 dataset. Experimental\nresults show that our PT-FSE system achieves substantial improvements over its\nbackbone, but also outperforms the current state-of-the-art while being 27\\%\nsmaller than the SOTA.

In contrast to the mainstream, this\nstudy investigates the joint VAD and OSD task from a new perspective. In\nparticular, we propose to extend traditional classification network with\nmulti-exit architecture.

By sampling the latent space in evaluation,\nLocal\\_INN outputs robot poses with covariance, which can be used to estimate\nthe uncertainty. We show that the localization performance of Local\\_INN is on\npar with current methods with much lower latency. We show detailed 2D and 3D\nmap reconstruction from Local\\_INN using poses exterior to the training set. We\nalso provide a global localization algorithm using Local\\_INN to tackle the\nkidnapping problem.",

    "abstract": "Incomplete Multi-View Clustering aims to enhance clustering performance by\nusing data from multiple modalities. Despite the fact that several approaches\nfor studying this issue have been proposed, the following drawbacks still\npersist: 1) It's difficult to learn latent representations that account for\ncomplementarity yet consistency without using label information; 2) and thus\nfails to take full advantage of the hidden information in incomplete data\nresults in suboptimal clustering performance when complete data is scarce. In\nthis paper, we propose Contrastive Incomplete Multi-View Image Clustering with\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (CIMIC-GAN), which uses GAN to fill in\nincomplete data and uses double contrastive learning to learn consistency on\ncomplete and incomplete data. More specifically, considering diversity and\ncomplementary information among multiple modalities, we incorporate\nautoencoding representation of complete and incomplete data into double\ncontrastive learning to achieve learning consistency. Integrating GANs into the\nautoencoding process can not only take full advantage of new features of\nincomplete data, but also better generalize the model in the presence of high\ndata missing rates. Experiments conducted on \\textcolor{black}{four}\nextensively-used datasets show that CIMIC-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art\nincomplete multi-View clustering methods.",

Due to the nonlinearity and nonlocality, the\nnumerical study of the PEs is in general a hard task. Neural network has been\nshown a promising machine learning tool to tackle this challenge. In this work,\nwe employ the physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate the\nsolutions to the PEs and study the error estimates. We first establish the\nhigher-order regularity for the global solutions to the PEs with either full\nviscosity and diffusivity, or with only the horizontal ones. Such higher-order\nregularity results are new and required in the analysis under the PINNs\nframework. Then we prove the existence of two layer tanh PINNs of which the\ncorresponding training error can be arbitrarily small by taking the width of\nPINNs to be sufficiently wide, and the error between the true solution and the\napproximation can be arbitrarily small provided that the training error is\nsmall enough and the sample set is large enough. In particular, our analysis\nincludes higher-order (in spatial Sobolev norm) error estimates, and improves\nexisting results in PINNs' literature which concerns only the $L^2$ error.\nNumerical results on prototype systems are presented for further illustrating\nthe advantage of using $H^s$ norm during the training.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing an accurate and consistent large-scale LiDAR point cloud map\nis crucial for robotics applications. The existing solution, pose graph\noptimization, though it is time-efficient, does not directly optimize the\nmapping consistency. LiDAR bundle adjustment (BA) has been recently proposed to\nresolve this issue; however, it is too time-consuming on large-scale maps. To\nmitigate this problem, this paper presents a globally consistent and efficient\nmapping method suitable for large-scale maps. Our proposed work consists of a\nbottom-up hierarchical BA and a top-down pose graph optimization, which\ncombines the advantages of both methods. With the hierarchical design, we solve\nmultiple BA problems with a much smaller Hessian matrix size than the original\nBA; with the pose graph optimization, we smoothly and efficiently update the\nLiDAR poses. The effectiveness and robustness of our proposed approach have\nbeen validated on multiple spatially and timely large-scale public spinning\nLiDAR datasets, i.e., KITTI, MulRan and Newer College, and self-collected\nsolid-state LiDAR datasets under structured and unstructured scenes.

The significant\npractical advantages of the HB method for learning problems are well known, but\nthe question of reducing communications has not been addressed.

The convergence\nguarantee of CHB is theoretically justified for both convex and nonconvex\ncases. In addition we prove that, under some conditions, at least half of all\ncommunications can be eliminated without any impact on convergence rate.\nExtensive numerical results validate the communication efficiency of CHB on\nboth synthetic and real datasets, for convex, nonconvex, and nondifferentiable\ncases.

    "abstract": "Machine programming (MP) is an emerging field at the intersection of\ndeterministic and probabilistic computing, and it aims to assist software and\nhardware engineers, among other applications. Along with powerful compute\nresources, MP systems often rely on vast amount of open-source code to learn\ninteresting properties about code and programming and solve problems in the\nareas of debugging, code recommendation, auto-completion, etc. Unfortunately,\nseveral of the existing MP systems either do not consider quality of code\nrepositories or use atypical quality measures than those typically used in\nsoftware engineering community to select them. As such, impact of quality of\ncode repositories on the performance of these systems needs to be studied.\nIn this preliminary paper, we evaluate impact of different quality\nrepositories on the performance of a candidate MP system. Towards that\nobjective, we develop a framework, named GitRank, to rank open-source\nrepositories on quality, maintainability, and popularity by leveraging existing\nresearch on this topic. We then apply GitRank to evaluate correlation between\nthe quality measures used by the candidate MP system and the quality measures\nused by our framework. Our preliminary results reveal some correlation between\nthe quality measures used in GitRank and ControlFlag's performance, suggesting\nthat some of the measures used in GitRank are applicable to ControlFlag.

In QKD-SIC systems, edge devices connected via quantum channels can\nefficiently encrypt semantic information from the semantic source, and securely\ntransmit the encrypted semantic information to the semantic destination. In\nthis paper, we consider an efficient resource (i.e., QKD and KM wavelengths)\nsharing problem to support QKD-SIC systems under the uncertainty of semantic\ninformation generated by edge devices. In such a system, QKD service providers\noffer QKD services with different subscription options to the edge devices. As\nsuch, to reduce the cost for the edge device users, we propose a QKD resource\nmanagement framework for the edge devices communicating semantic information.\nThe framework is based on a two-stage stochastic optimization model to achieve\noptimal QKD deployment. Moreover, to reduce the deployment cost of QKD service\nproviders, QKD resources in the proposed framework can be utilized based on\nefficient QKD-SIC resource management, including semantic information\ntransmission among edge devices, secret-key provisioning, and cooperation\nformation among QKD service providers. In detail, the formulated two-stage\nstochastic optimization model can achieve the optimal QKD-SIC resource\ndeployment while meeting the secret-key requirements for semantic information\ntransmission of edge devices. Moreover, to share the cost of the QKD resource\npool among cooperative QKD service providers forming a coalition in a fair and\ninterpretable manner, the proposed framework leverages the concept of Shapley\nvalue from cooperative game theory as a solution. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed framework can reduce the deployment cost by about\n40% compared with existing non-cooperative baselines.",

    "abstract": "Cyrillic and Traditional Mongolian are the two main members of the Mongolian\nwriting system. The Cyrillic-Traditional Mongolian Bidirectional Conversion\n(CTMBC) task includes two conversion processes, including Cyrillic Mongolian to\nTraditional Mongolian (C2T) and Traditional Mongolian to Cyrillic Mongolian\nconversions (T2C). Previous researchers adopted the traditional joint sequence\nmodel, since the CTMBC task is a natural Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq)\nmodeling problem. Recent studies have shown that Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)\nand Self-attention (or Transformer) based encoder-decoder models have shown\nsignificant improvement in machine translation tasks between some major\nlanguages, such as Mandarin, English, French, etc. However, an open problem\nremains as to whether the CTMBC quality can be improved by utilizing the RNN\nand Transformer models. To answer this question, this paper investigates the\nutility of these two powerful techniques for CTMBC task combined with\nagglutinative characteristics of Mongolian language. We build the\nencoder-decoder based CTMBC model based on RNN and Transformer respectively and\ncompare the different network configurations deeply. The experimental results\nshow that both RNN and Transformer models outperform the traditional joint\nsequence model, where the Transformer achieves the best performance.

    "abstract": "Strong adversarial examples are the keys to evaluating and enhancing the\nrobustness of deep neural networks. The popular adversarial attack algorithms\nmaximize the non-concave loss function using the gradient ascent. However, the\nperformance of each attack is usually sensitive to, for instance, minor image\ntransformations due to insufficient information (only one input example, few\nwhite-box source models and unknown defense strategies). Hence, the crafted\nadversarial examples are prone to overfit the source model, which limits their\ntransferability to unidentified architectures. In this paper, we propose\nMultiple Asymptotically Normal Distribution Attacks (MultiANDA), a novel method\nthat explicitly characterizes adversarial perturbations from a learned\ndistribution. Specifically, we approximate the posterior distribution over the\nperturbations by taking advantage of the asymptotic normality property of\nstochastic gradient ascent (SGA), then apply the ensemble strategy on this\nprocedure to estimate a Gaussian mixture model for a better exploration of the\npotential optimization space. Drawing perturbations from the learned\ndistribution allow us to generate any number of adversarial examples for each\ninput. The approximated posterior essentially describes the stationary\ndistribution of SGA iterations, which captures the geometric information around\nthe local optimum. Thus, the samples drawn from the distribution reliably\nmaintain the transferability. Our proposed method outperforms nine\nstate-of-the-art black-box attacks on deep learning models with or without\ndefenses through extensive experiments on seven normally trained and seven\ndefence models.",

    "title": "Explainable Reinforcement Learning via Model Transforms",
    "abstract": "Understanding emerging behaviors of reinforcement learning (RL) agents may be\ndifficult since such agents are often trained in complex environments using\nhighly complex decision making procedures. This has given rise to a variety of\napproaches to explainability in RL that aim to reconcile discrepancies that may\narise between the behavior of an agent and the behavior that is anticipated by\nan observer. Most recent approaches have relied either on domain knowledge,\nthat may not always be available, on an analysis of the agent's policy, or on\nan analysis of specific elements of the underlying environment, typically\nmodeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Our key claim is that even if the\nunderlying MDP is not fully known (e.g., the transition probabilities have not\nbeen accurately learned) or is not maintained by the agent (i.e., when using\nmodel-free methods), it can nevertheless be exploited to automatically generate\nexplanations. For this purpose, we suggest using formal MDP abstractions and\ntransforms, previously used in the literature for expediting the search for\noptimal policies, to automatically produce explanations. Since such transforms\nare typically based on a symbolic representation of the environment, they may\nrepresent meaningful explanations for gaps between the anticipated and actual\nagent behavior. We formally define this problem, suggest a class of transforms\nthat can be used for explaining emergent behaviors, and suggest methods that\nenable efficient search for an explanation. We demonstrate the approach on a\nset of standard benchmarks.",

    "title": "Tracking and Reconstructing Hand Object Interactions from Point Cloud  Sequences in the Wild",
    "abstract": "In this work, we tackle the challenging task of jointly tracking hand object\npose and reconstructing their shapes from depth point cloud sequences in the\nwild, given the initial poses at frame 0. We for the first time propose a point\ncloud based hand joint tracking network, HandTrackNet, to estimate the\ninter-frame hand joint motion. Our HandTrackNet proposes a novel hand pose\ncanonicalization module to ease the tracking task, yielding accurate and robust\nhand joint tracking. Our pipeline then reconstructs the full hand via\nconverting the predicted hand joints into a template-based parametric hand\nmodel MANO. For object tracking, we devise a simple yet effective module that\nestimates the object SDF from the first frame and performs optimization-based\ntracking. Finally, a joint optimization step is adopted to perform joint hand\nand object reasoning, which alleviates the occlusion-induced ambiguity and\nfurther refines the hand pose. During training, the whole pipeline only sees\npurely synthetic data, which are synthesized with sufficient variations and by\ndepth simulation for the ease of generalization. The whole pipeline is\npertinent to the generalization gaps and thus directly transferable to real\nin-the-wild data. We evaluate our method on two real hand object interaction\ndatasets, e.g. HO3D and DexYCB, without any finetuning. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the previous\nstate-of-the-art depth-based hand and object pose estimation and tracking\nmethods, running at a frame rate of 9 FPS.",

While\nthe training of deep SNN is still an open problem, which limits the real-world\napplications of deep SNN. Here we propose a deep SNN architecture named Spiking\nSiamFC++ for object tracking with end-to-end direct training. Specifically, the\nAlexNet network is extended in the time domain to extract the feature, and the\nsurrogate gradient function is adopted to realize direct supervised training of\nthe deep SNN. To examine the performance of the Spiking SiamFC++, several\ntracking benchmarks including OTB2013, OTB2015, VOT2015, VOT2016, and UAV123\nare considered. It is found that, the precision loss is small compared with the\noriginal SiamFC++. Compared with the existing SNN-based target tracker, e.g.,\nthe SiamSNN, the precision (succession) of the proposed Spiking SiamFC++\nreaches 85.24% (64.37%), which is much higher than that of 52.78% (44.32%)\nachieved by the SiamSNN. To our best knowledge, the performance of the Spiking\nSiamFC++ outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches in SNN-based\nobject tracking, which provides a novel path for SNN application in the field\nof target tracking.

Different from classical techniques for tuning parameters in a\ncontroller, we allow tunable parameters appearing in both the system dynamics\nand the objective functions of each agent. A framework is developed to allow\nall agents to reach a consensus on the tunable parameter, which minimizes team\nloss. The key idea of the proposed algorithm rests on the integration of\nconsensus-based distributed optimization for a multi-agent system and a\ngradient generator capturing the optimal performance as a function of the\nparameter in the feedback loop tuning the parameter for each agent.

We show that a matrix class has bounded twin-width if and\nonly if its linear-minor closure does not contain all matrices. We observe that\nthe fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for first-order model checking on\nstructures given with an $O(1)$-sequence (certificate of bounded twin-width)\nand the fact that first-order transductions of bounded twin-width classes have\nbounded twin-width, both established in Twin-width I, extend to first-order\nlogic with modular counting quantifiers. We make explicit a win-win argument\nobtained as a by-product of Twin-width IV, and somewhat similar to\nbidimensionality, that we call rank-bidimensionality. Armed with the\nabove-mentioned extension to modular counting, we show that the twin-width of\nthe product of two conformal matrices $A, B$ over a finite field is bounded by\na function of the twin-width of $A$, of $B$, and of the size of the field.\nFurthermore, if $A$ and $B$ are $n \\times n$ matrices of twin-width $d$ over\n$\\mathbb F_q$, we show that $AB$ can be computed in time $O_{d,q}(n^2 \\log n)$.\nWe finally present an ad hoc algorithm to efficiently multiply two matrices of\nbounded twin-width, with a single-exponential dependence in the twin-width\nbound: If the inputs are given in a compact tree-like form, called\ntwin-decomposition (of width $d$), then two $n \\times n$ matrices $A, B$ over\n$\\mathbb F_2$, a twin-decomposition of $AB$ with width $2^{d+o(d)}$ can be\ncomputed in time $4^{d+o(d)}n$ (resp. $4^{d+o(d)}n^{1+\\varepsilon}$), and\nentries queried in doubly-logarithmic (resp. constant) time.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) offer great versatility for encoding,\ngenerating and adapting complex end-effector trajectories. DMPs are also very\nwell suited to learning manipulation skills from human demonstration. However,\nthe reactive nature of DMPs restricts their applicability for tool use and\nobject manipulation tasks involving non-holonomic constraints, such as scalpel\ncutting or catheter steering. In this work, we extend the Cartesian space DMP\nformulation by adding a coupling term that enforces a pre-defined set of\nnon-holonomic constraints. We obtain the closed-form expression for the\nconstraint forcing term using the Udwadia-Kalaba method. This approach offers a\nclean and practical solution for guaranteed constraint satisfaction at\nrun-time. Further, the proposed analytical form of the constraint forcing term\nenables efficient trajectory optimization subject to constraints. We\ndemonstrate the usefulness of this approach by showing how we can learn robotic\ncutting skills from human demonstration.",

However, due to the lack of realism and clarity in texture\nreconstruction by 3DMM, there is a domain gap between the synthetic image and\nthe rendered image of 3DMM. Since rendered 3DMM images contain facial region\nonly without the background, directly computing the loss between these two\ndomains is not ideal and the resultant trained model will be biased. In this\nstudy, we propose to explicitly edit the latent space of the pretrained\nStyleGAN by controlling the parameters of the 3DMM. To address the domain gap\nproblem, we propose a noval network called 'Map and edit' and a simple but\neffective attribute editing method to avoid direct loss computation between\nrendered and synthesized images. Furthermore, since our model can accurately\ngenerate multi-view face images while the identity remains unchanged. As a\nby-product, combined with visibility masks, our proposed model can also\ngenerate texture-rich and high-resolution UV facial textures.

However, human drivers can adapt to\nvaried driving tasks without demonstrations by taking efficient and structural\nexplorations in the entire skill space rather than a limited space with\ntask-specific skills. Inspired by the above fact, we propose an RL algorithm\nexploring all feasible motion skills instead of a limited set of task-specific\nand object-centric skills. Without demonstrations, our method can still perform\nwell in diverse tasks. First, we build a task-agnostic and ego-centric (TaEc)\nmotion skill library in a pure motion perspective, which is diverse enough to\nbe reusable in different complex tasks. The motion skills are then encoded into\na low-dimension latent skill space, in which RL can do exploration efficiently.\nValidations in various challenging driving scenarios demonstrate that our\nproposed method, TaEc-RL, outperforms its counterparts significantly in\nlearning efficiency and task performance.",

Next, we examine the\ncharacteristics of trusted computing within the context of its application to\ndigital currency systems and its potential impact on the power relationships\nbetween the users of devices, the manufacturers of devices, and other powerful\nactors such as corporations and the state. Finally, we assess the validity of\ncommon justifications for certified hardware in the context of alternative\ndesigns, limitations, and trade-offs. We conclude that the interests of\nconsumers would be better served by design approaches to digital currency that\ndo not require the use of trusted hardware.",

This also enables different models\n(physical simulation or machine learning models) and workflows to be connected\nto produce combined risk assessment.

    "abstract": "Reliably predicting the future spread of brain tumors using imaging data and\non a subject-specific basis requires quantifying uncertainties in data,\nbiophysical models of tumor growth, and spatial heterogeneity of tumor and host\ntissue. This work introduces a Bayesian framework to calibrate the spatial\ndistribution of the parameters within a tumor growth model to quantitative\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data and demonstrates its implementation in a\npre-clinical model of glioma. The framework leverages an atlas-based brain\nsegmentation of grey and white matter to establish subject-specific priors and\ntunable spatial dependencies of the model parameters in each region. Using this\nframework, the tumor-specific parameters are calibrated from quantitative MRI\nmeasurements early in the course of tumor development in four rats and used to\npredict the spatial development of the tumor at later times. The results\nsuggest that the tumor model, calibrated by animal-specific imaging data at one\ntime point, can accurately predict tumor shapes with a Dice coefficient > 0.89.\nHowever, the reliability of the predicted volume and shape of tumors strongly\nrelies on the number of earlier imaging time points used for calibrating the\nmodel. This study demonstrates, for the first time, the ability to determine\nthe uncertainty in the inferred tissue heterogeneity and the model predicted\ntumor shape.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capability\nin generating fluent text. LLMs have also shown an alarming tendency to\nreproduce social biases, for example stereotypical associations between gender\nand occupation or race and criminal behavior. Like race and gender, morality is\nan important social variable; our moral biases affect how we receive other\npeople and their arguments. I anticipate that the apparent moral capabilities\nof LLMs will play an important role in their effects on the human social\nenvironment. This work investigates whether LLMs reproduce the moral biases\nassociated with political groups, a capability I refer to as moral mimicry. I\nexplore this hypothesis in GPT-3, a 175B-parameter language model based on the\nTransformer architecture, using tools from Moral Foundations Theory to measure\nthe moral content in text generated by the model following prompting with\nliberal and conservative political identities. The results demonstrate that\nlarge language models are indeed moral mimics; when prompted with a political\nidentity, GPT-3 generates text reflecting the corresponding moral biases. Moral\nmimicry could contribute to fostering understanding between social groups via\nmoral reframing. Worryingly, it could also reinforce polarized views,\nexacerbating existing social challenges. I hope that this work encourages\nfurther investigation of the moral mimicry capability, including how to\nleverage it for social good and minimize its risks.",

In these problems, a gradient of the\nloss function is typically presented as a product of two PDE solutions, one for\nthe forward equation and the other for the adjoint. When MC solvers are used,\nthe numerical solutions are Dirac measures. As such, one immediately faces the\ndifficulty in explaining the multiplication of two measures. This suggests that\nMC solvers are naturally incompatible with gradient-based optimization under\nPDE constraints. In this paper, we study two different strategies to overcome\nthe difficulty. One is to adopt the Discrete-Then-Optimize technique and\nconduct the full optimization on the algebraic system, avoiding the Dirac\nmeasures. The second strategy stays within the Optimize-Then-Discretize\nframework. We propose a correlated simulation where, instead of using MC\nsolvers separately for both forward and adjoint problems, we recycle the\nsamples in the forward simulation in the adjoint solver. This frames the\nadjoint solution as a test function, and hence allows a rigorous convergence\nanalysis. The investigation is presented through the lens of the radiative\ntransfer equation, either in the inverse setting from optical imaging or in the\noptimal control framework.

    "abstract": "Scientists often use observational time series data to study complex natural\nprocesses, from climate change to civil conflict to brain activity. But\nregression analyses of these data often assume simplistic dynamics. Recent\nadvances in deep learning have yielded startling improvements to the\nperformance of models of complex processes, from speech comprehension to\nnuclear physics to competitive gaming. But deep learning is generally not used\nfor scientific analysis. Here, we bridge this gap by showing that deep learning\ncan be used, not just to imitate, but to analyze complex processes, providing\nflexible function approximation while preserving interpretability. Our approach\n-- the continuous-time deconvolutional regressive neural network (CDRNN) --\nrelaxes standard simplifying assumptions (e.g., linearity, stationarity, and\nhomoscedasticity) that are implausible for many natural systems and may\ncritically affect the interpretation of data. We evaluate CDRNNs on incremental\nhuman language processing, a domain with complex continuous dynamics. We\ndemonstrate dramatic improvements to predictive likelihood in behavioral and\nneuroimaging data, and we show that CDRNNs enable flexible discovery of novel\npatterns in exploratory analyses, provide robust control of possible confounds\nin confirmatory analyses, and open up research questions that are otherwise\nhard to study using observational data.",

To detect co-saliency\n(segmentation) accurately, the core problem is to well model inter-image\nrelations between an image group. Some methods design sophisticated modules,\nsuch as recurrent neural network (RNN), to address this problem. However,\norder-sensitive problem is the major drawback of RNN, which heavily affects the\nstability of proposed CoSOD (CoSEG) model. In this paper, inspired by RNN-based\nmodel, we first propose a multi-path stable recurrent unit (MSRU), containing\ndummy orders mechanisms (DOM) and recurrent unit (RU). Our proposed MSRU not\nonly helps CoSOD (CoSEG) model captures robust inter-image relations, but also\nreduces order-sensitivity, resulting in a more stable inference and training\nprocess. { Moreover, we design a cross-order contrastive loss (COCL) that can\nfurther address order-sensitive problem by pulling close the feature embedding\ngenerated from different input orders.} We validate our model on five widely\nused CoSOD datasets (CoCA, CoSOD3k, Cosal2015, iCoseg and MSRC), and three\nwidely used datasets (Internet, iCoseg and PASCAL-VOC) for object\nco-segmentation, the performance demonstrates the superiority of the proposed\napproach as compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.",

The fundamental idea of image coding is to\nremove correlations among pixels before quantization and entropy coding, e.g.,\nthe discrete cosine transform (DCT) and intra predictions, adopted by modern\nimage coding standards. We present a new method to remove pixel correlations.\nFirst, by decomposing correlations into long- and short-range correlations, we\nrepresent long-range correlations in coarser grids due to their smoothness,\nthus leading to a multi-grid (MG) coding architecture. Second, we show that\nshort-range correlations can be effectively coded by a suite of vector\nquantizers (VQs). Along this line, we argue the effectiveness of VQs of very\nlarge block sizes and present a convenient way to implement them.

Regardless\nof the domain, anomaly detection is typically framed as a one-class\nclassification task, where the learning is conducted on normal examples only.\nAn entire family of successful anomaly detection methods is based on learning\nto reconstruct masked normal inputs (e.g. patches, future frames, etc.) and\nexerting the magnitude of the reconstruction error as an indicator for the\nabnormality level. Unlike other reconstruction-based methods, we present a\nnovel self-supervised masked convolutional transformer block (SSMCTB) that\ncomprises the reconstruction-based functionality at a core architectural level.\nThe proposed self-supervised block is extremely flexible, enabling information\nmasking at any layer of a neural network and being compatible with a wide range\nof neural architectures.

Next, the JTLL module is\njointly trained with recent approaches to additionally learn unvisited\nrelations for the recommendation task. Experiments conducted on two known\nreal-world LBSN datasets show that our joint training module was able to\nimprove the performances of recent existing works.",

    "abstract": "Advertisement video editing aims to automatically edit advertising videos\ninto shorter videos while retaining coherent content and crucial information\nconveyed by advertisers. It mainly contains two stages: video segmentation and\nsegment assemblage. The existing method performs well at video segmentation\nstages but suffers from the problems of dependencies on extra cumbersome models\nand poor performance at the segment assemblage stage. To address these\nproblems, we propose M-SAN (Multi-modal Segment Assemblage Network) which can\nperform efficient and coherent segment assemblage task end-to-end. It utilizes\nmulti-modal representation extracted from the segments and follows the\nEncoder-Decoder Ptr-Net framework with the Attention mechanism.\nImportance-coherence reward is designed for training M-SAN. We experiment on\nthe Ads-1k dataset with 1000+ videos under rich ad scenarios collected from\nadvertisers. To evaluate the methods, we propose a unified metric,\nImp-Coh@Time, which comprehensively assesses the importance, coherence, and\nduration of the outputs at the same time. Experimental results show that our\nmethod achieves better performance than random selection and the previous\nmethod on the metric. Ablation experiments further verify that multi-modal\nrepresentation and importance-coherence reward significantly improve the\nperformance.

The empirical fourfold zero-padding [ Vico et al\nJ. Comput. Phys. (2016) ] puts a heavy burden on memory requirement especially\nfor higher dimension problems. In this paper, we derive the optimal\nzero-padding factor, that is, $\\sqrt{d}+1$, for the first time together with a\nrigorous proof. The memory cost is greatly reduced to a small fraction, i.e.,\n$(\\frac{\\sqrt{d}+1}{4})^d$, of what is needed in the original fourfold\nalgorithm. For example, in the precomputation step, a double-precision\ncomputation on a $256^3$ grid requires a minimum $3.4$ Gb memory with the\noptimal threefold zero-padding, while the fourfold algorithm requires around\n$8$ Gb where the reduction factor is $\\frac{37}{64}\\approx \\frac{3}{5}$. Then,\nwe present the error estimates of the potential and density in $d$ dimension.\nNext, we re-investigate the optimal zero-padding factor for the anisotropic\ndensity.

Developing robust and\nhigh security Automated Fingerprint Recognition Systems (AFRSs) are possible if\nthe depth information can be fully utilized. However, in existing studies,\nPresentation Attack Detection (PAD) and subsurface fingerprint reconstruction\nbased on depth information are treated as two independent branches, resulting\nin high computation and complexity of AFRS building.Thus, this paper proposes a\nuniform representation model for OCT-based fingerprint PAD and subsurface\nfingerprint reconstruction. Firstly, we design a novel semantic segmentation\nnetwork which only trained by real finger slices of OCT-based fingerprints to\nextract multiple subsurface structures from those slices (also known as\nB-scans). The latent codes derived from the network are directly used to\neffectively detect the PA since they contain abundant subsurface biological\ninformation, which is independent with PA materials and has strong robustness\nfor unknown PAs. Meanwhile, the segmented subsurface structures are adopted to\nreconstruct multiple subsurface 2D fingerprints. Recognition can be easily\nachieved by using existing mature technologies based on traditional 2D\nfingerprints. Extensive experiments are carried on our own established\ndatabase, which is the largest public OCT-based fingerprint database with 2449\nvolumes. In PAD task, our method can improve 0.33% Acc from the\nstate-of-the-art method. For reconstruction performance, our method achieves\nthe best performance with 0.834 mIOU and 0.937 PA.

    "abstract": "Modeling sparse and dense image matching within a unified functional\ncorrespondence model has recently attracted increasing research interest.\nHowever, existing efforts mainly focus on improving matching accuracy while\nignoring its efficiency, which is crucial for realworld applications. In this\npaper, we propose an efficient structure named Efficient Correspondence\nTransformer (ECO-TR) by finding correspondences in a coarse-to-fine manner,\nwhich significantly improves the efficiency of functional correspondence model.\nTo achieve this, multiple transformer blocks are stage-wisely connected to\ngradually refine the predicted coordinates upon a shared multi-scale feature\nextraction network. Given a pair of images and for arbitrary query coordinates,\nall the correspondences are predicted within a single feed-forward pass. We\nfurther propose an adaptive query-clustering strategy and an uncertainty-based\noutlier detection module to cooperate with the proposed framework for faster\nand better predictions. Experiments on various sparse and dense matching tasks\ndemonstrate the superiority of our method in both efficiency and effectiveness\nagainst existing state-of-the-arts.",

    "abstract": "Cold start is an essential and persistent problem in recommender systems.\nState-of-the-art solutions rely on training hybrid models for both cold-start\nand existing users/items, based on the auxiliary information. Such a hybrid\nmodel would compromise the performance of existing users/items, which might\nmake these solutions not applicable in real-worlds recommender systems where\nthe experience of existing users/items must be guaranteed. Meanwhile, graph\nneural networks (GNNs) have been demonstrated to perform effectively warm\n(non-cold-start) recommendations. However, they have never been applied to\nhandle the cold-start problem in a user-item bipartite graph. This is a\nchallenging but rewarding task since cold-start users/items do not have links.\nBesides, it is nontrivial to design an appropriate GNN to conduct cold-start\nrecommendations while maintaining the performance for existing users/items. To\nbridge the gap, we propose a tailored GNN-based framework (GPatch) that\ncontains two separate but correlated components. First, an efficient GNN\narchitecture -- GWarmer, is designed to model the warm users/items. Second, we\nconstruct correlated Patching Networks to simulate and patch GWarmer by\nconducting cold-start recommendations. Experiments on benchmark and large-scale\ncommercial datasets demonstrate that GPatch is significantly superior in\nproviding recommendations for both existing and cold-start users/items.",

    "abstract": "Hand hygiene is a standard six-step hand-washing action proposed by the World\nHealth Organization (WHO). However, there is no good way to supervise medical\nstaff to do hand hygiene, which brings the potential risk of disease spread. In\nthis work, we propose a new computer vision task called hand hygiene assessment\nto provide intelligent supervision of hand hygiene for medical staff. Existing\naction assessment works usually make an overall quality prediction on an entire\nvideo. However, the internal structures of hand hygiene action are important in\nhand hygiene assessment. Therefore, we propose a novel fine-grained learning\nframework to perform step segmentation and key action scorer in a joint manner\nfor accurate hand hygiene assessment. Existing temporal segmentation methods\nusually employ multi-stage convolutional network to improve the segmentation\nrobustness, but easily lead to over-segmentation due to the lack of the\nlong-range dependence. To address this issue, we design a multi-stage\nconvolution-transformer network for step segmentation. Based on the observation\nthat each hand-washing step involves several key actions which determine the\nhand-washing quality, we design a set of key action scorers to evaluate the\nquality of key actions in each step. In addition, there lacks a unified dataset\nin hand hygiene assessment. Therefore, under the supervision of medical staff,\nwe contribute a video dataset that contains 300 video sequences with\nfine-grained annotations. Extensive experiments on the dataset suggest that our\nmethod well assesses hand hygiene videos and achieves outstanding performance.",

Iterative algorithms may be less computationally efficient\nor might fail to converge in some cases. We investigate the achievable\nefficiency of robust iterative Riemann solvers for relatively simple systems,\nfocusing on the shallow water and Euler equations.

Despite the increased access to earth observation data\nfor agriculture, there is a scarcity of curated, labelled datasets, which\nlimits the potential of its use in training ML models for remote sensing (RS)\nin agriculture. To this end, we introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset, SICKLE,\nhaving time-series images at different spatial resolutions from 3 different\nsatellites, annotated with multiple key cropping parameters for paddy\ncultivation for the Cauvery Delta region in Tamil Nadu, India. The dataset\ncomprises of 2,398 season-wise samples from 388 unique plots distributed across\n4 districts of the Delta. The dataset covers multi-spectral, thermal and\nmicrowave data between the time period January 2018-March 2021. The paddy\nsamples are annotated with 4 key cropping parameters, i.e. sowing date,\ntransplanting date, harvesting date and crop yield. This is one of the first\nstudies to consider the growing season (using sowing and harvesting dates) as\npart of a dataset. We also propose a yield prediction strategy that uses\ntime-series data generated based on the observed growing season and the\nstandard seasonal information obtained from Tamil Nadu Agricultural University\nfor the region. The consequent performance improvement highlights the impact of\nML techniques that leverage domain knowledge that are consistent with standard\npractices followed by farmers in a specific region.

However, due to the heterogeneity of\nmulti-modal data, multi-modal representation learning becomes one of the main\nchallenges. On one hand, it is difficult to extract the relevant features from\nmulti-modalities by only one feature extractor, on the other hand, previous\nstudies have not fully explored the potential of multi-modal fusion strategies.\nFor example, early fusion usually required all modalities to be present during\ninference, while late fusion and middle fusion increased the network size for\nfeature learning. In contrast to a large amount of work on late fusion, there\nare few works on early fusion to explore the channel information. This paper\npresents a novel multi-modal network called Multi-modal Channel-Mixing (MCM),\nas a pre-trained model to learn a robust representation in order to facilitate\nthe multi-modal fusion. We evaluate the learned representation on a downstream\ntask of automatic facial action units detection.

Quantization is one of the methods to reduce power and\ncomputation requirements for neural networks by limiting bit precision.\nResistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) devices are great candidates for\nQuantized Neural Networks (QNN) implementations. As the number of possible\nconductive states in RRAMs is limited, a certain level of quantization is\nalways considered when designing RRAM-based neural networks. In this work, we\nprovide a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art RRAM-based QNN\nimplementations, showing where RRAMs stand in terms of satisfying the criteria\nof efficient QNN hardware.

    "abstract": "Cooperative sensing and heterogeneous information fusion are critical to\nrealize vehicular cyber-physical systems (VCPSs). This paper makes the first\nattempt to quantitatively measure the quality of VCPS by designing a new metric\ncalled Age of View (AoV). Specifically, a vehicular edge computing (VEC)\narchitecture is presented, in which heterogeneous information can be\ncooperatively sensed and uploaded via Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I)\ncommunications. Logical views can be constructed by fusing the heterogeneous\ninformation at edge nodes. Further, we derive a cooperative sensing model based\non the multi-class M/G/1 priority queue. On this basis, we define the AoV by\nmodeling the timeliness, completeness, and consistency of the logical views.\nThen, we formulate the problem, which aims at maximizing the quality of VCPS.\nFurther, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning solution is proposed. The\nsystem state includes vehicle sensed information, edge cached information, and\nview requirements. The vehicle action space consists of the sensing frequencies\nand uploading priorities of information, and the edge action space is the V2I\nbandwidth allocation. The system reward is defined as the achieved VCPS\nquality. In particular, a difference-reward-based credit assignment is designed\nto divide the system reward into the difference reward for vehicles, reflecting\ntheir individual contributions. Finally, we build the simulation model and give\na comprehensive performance evaluation, which conclusively demonstrates the\nsuperiority of the proposed solution.",

However, relying on\nhigh-dimensional image data to make control decisions raises important\nquestions; particularly, how might we prove the safety of a visual-feedback\ncontroller? Control barrier functions (CBFs) are powerful tools for certifying\nthe safety of feedback controllers in the state-feedback setting, but CBFs have\ntraditionally been poorly-suited to visual feedback control due to the need to\npredict future observations in order to evaluate the barrier function. In this\nwork, we solve this issue by leveraging recent advances in neural radiance\nfields (NeRFs), which learn implicit representations of 3D scenes and can\nrender images from previously-unseen camera perspectives, to provide\nsingle-step visual foresight for a CBF-based controller. This novel combination\nis able to filter out unsafe actions and intervene to preserve safety.

In this work, we consider the case where the\npreferences over possible outcomes are a partial order rather than a total\norder. We first introduce a variant of deterministic finite automaton, referred\nto as a preference DFA, for specifying the user's preferences over temporally\nextended goals. Based on the order theory, we translate the preference DFA to a\npreference relation over policies for probabilistic planning in a labeled MDP.\nIn this treatment, a most preferred policy induces a weak-stochastic\nnondominated probability distribution over the finite paths in the MDP. The\nproposed planning algorithm hinges on the construction of a multi-objective\nMDP. We prove that a weak-stochastic nondominated policy given the preference\nspecification is Pareto-optimal in the constructed multi-objective MDP, and\nvice versa.

A vertex pair\n$(s,t)$ is $(p,q)$-flex-connected if $s$ and $t$ have $p$ edge-connectivity\neven after the removal of any $q$ unsafe edges. Given a graph $G$, the goal is\nto choose a min-cost subgraph $H$ of $G$ that has desired flex-connectivity for\na given set of vertex pairs. This model generalizes the well-studied\nedge-connectivity based network design, however, even special cases are\nprovably much harder to approximate.\nThe approximability of network design in this model has been mainly studied\nfor two settings of interest: (i) single pair setting under the names FTP and\nFTF (fault tolerant path and fault tolerant flow), (ii) spanning setting under\nthe name FGC (flexible graph connectivity). There have been several positive\nresults in these papers. However, despite similarity to the well-known network\ndesign problems, this new model has been challenging to design approximation\nalgorithms for, especially when $p,q \\ge 2$. We obtain two results that advance\nour understanding of algorithm design in this model.\n1. We obtain a $5$-approximation for the $(2,2)$-flex-connectivity for a\nsingle pair $(s,t)$. Previously no non-trivial approximation was known for this\nsetting.\n2. We obtain $O(p)$ approximation for $(p,2)$ and $(p,3)$-FGC for any $p \\ge\n1$, and for $(p,4)$-FGC for any even $p$. We obtain an $O(q)$-approximation for\n$(2,q)$-FGC for any $q \\ge 1$.

This framework exploits\nstochastic trust observations between robots to arrive at tractable, resilient\ndecision making at a centralized Fusion Center (FC) even when i) there exist\nmalicious robots in the network and their number may be larger than the number\nof legitimate robots, and ii) the FC uses one-shot noisy measurements from all\nrobots. We derive two algorithms to achieve this. The first is the Two Stage\nApproach (2SA) that estimates the legitimacy of robots based on received trust\nobservations, and provably minimizes the probability of detection error in the\nworst-case malicious attack. Here, the proportion of malicious robots is known\nbut arbitrary. For the case of an unknown proportion of malicious robots, we\ndevelop the Adversarial Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (A-GLRT) that uses\nboth the reported robot measurements and trust observations to estimate the\ntrustworthiness of robots, their reporting strategy, and the correct hypothesis\nsimultaneously. We exploit special problem structure to show that this approach\nremains computationally tractable despite several unknown problem parameters.\nWe deploy both algorithms in a hardware experiment where a group of robots\nconducts crowdsensing of traffic conditions on a mock-up road network similar\nin spirit to Google Maps, subject to a Sybil attack.

    "abstract": "We study the problem of enumerating results from a query over a compressed\ndocument. The model we use for compression are straight-line programs (SLPs),\nwhich are defined by a context-free grammar that produces a single string. For\nour queries we use a model called Annotated Automata, an extension of regular\nautomata that allows annotations on letters. This model extends the notion of\nRegular Spanners as it allows arbitrarily long outputs. Our main result is an\nalgorithm which evaluates such a query by enumerating all results with\noutput-linear delay after a preprocessing phase which takes linear time on the\nsize of the SLP, and cubic time over the size of the automaton. This is an\nimprovement over Schmid and Schweikardt's result, which, with the same\npreprocessing time, enumerates with a delay which is logarithmic on the size of\nthe uncompressed document. We achieve this through a persistent data structure\nnamed Enumerable Compact Sets with Shifts which guarantees output-linear delay\nunder certain restrictions. These results imply constant-delay enumeration\nalgorithms in the context of regular spanners. Further, we use an extension of\nannotated automata which utilizes succinctly encoded annotations to save an\nexponential factor from previous results that dealt with constant-delay\nenumeration over vset automata. Lastly, we extend our results in the same\nfashion Schmid and Schweikardt did to allow complex document editing while\nmaintaining the constant-delay guarantee.",

    "abstract": "We consider the open federated learning (FL) systems, where clients may join\nand/or leave the system during the FL process. Given the variability of the\nnumber of present clients, convergence to a fixed model cannot be guaranteed in\nopen systems. Instead, we resort to a new performance metric that we term the\nstability of open FL systems, which quantifies the magnitude of the learned\nmodel in open systems. Under the assumption that local clients' functions are\nstrongly convex and smooth, we theoretically quantify the radius of stability\nfor two FL algorithms, namely local SGD and local Adam. We observe that this\nradius relies on several key parameters, including the function condition\nnumber as well as the variance of the stochastic gradient. Our theoretical\nresults are further verified by numerical simulations on both synthetic and\nreal-world benchmark data-sets.",

Such features typically work only for resources of one type within\none application, ignoring the interdependency between resources needed for a\nsingle task. In addition, text-based handles do not provide rich cues for users\nto recognize their associated resources. Hence, the need to locate and reopen\nrelevant resources can significantly hinder knowledge workers' productivity. To\naddress these issues, we designed and developed Scrapbook, a novel application\nfor digital resource curation across applications that uses screenshot-based\nbookmarks.

An important feature of this model is that qubits decohere and so\nabandon over time. In contrast to classical server-based queueing models, the\ncombination of queueing, server-less multi-way matching, and abandonment make\nthe analysis a challenging problem. The primary focus of this paper is to study\na simple system consisting of two types of requests and three types of qubits\n(dubbed the W-topology) operating under a Max-Weight policy.\nIn this setting, we characterize the stability region under the Max-Weight\npolicy by adopting a two-time scale fluid limit to get a handle on the\nabandonments. In particular, we show that Max-Weight is throughput optimal and\nthat its stability region is larger than the convex hull of the throughputs\nthat can be achieved by non-idling policies when the requests are infinitely\nbacklogged.

However, it involves solving a PDE, whose computational and memory\ncomplexity scales exponentially with respect to the state dimensionality,\nmaking its direct use on large-scale systems intractable. A recently proposed\nmethod called DeepReach overcomes this challenge by leveraging a sinusoidal\nneural network PDE solver for high-dimensional reachability problems, whose\ncomputational requirements scale with the complexity of the underlying\nreachable tube rather than the state space dimension. Unfortunately, neural\nnetworks can make errors and thus the computed solution may not be safe, which\nfalls short of achieving our overarching goal to provide formal safety\nassurances. In this work, we propose a method to compute an error bound for the\nDeepReach solution. This error bound can then be used for reachable tube\ncorrection, resulting in a provably safe approximation of the true reachable\ntube. We also propose a scenario optimization-based approach to compute this\nerror bound for general nonlinear dynamical systems.

    "abstract": "In the study of subsurface seismic imaging, solving the acoustic wave\nequation is a pivotal component in existing models. With the advancement of\ndeep learning, neural networks are applied to numerically solve partial\ndifferential equations by learning the mapping between the inputs and the\nsolution of the equation, the wave equation in particular, since traditional\nmethods can be time consuming if numerous instances are to be solved. Previous\nworks that concentrate on solving the wave equation by neural networks consider\neither a single velocity model or multiple simple velocity models, which is\nrestricted in practice. Therefore, inspired by the idea of operator learning,\nthis work leverages the Fourier neural operator (FNO) to effectively learn the\nfrequency domain seismic wavefields under the context of variable velocity\nmodels. Moreover, we propose a new framework paralleled Fourier neural operator\n(PFNO) for efficiently training the FNO-based solver given multiple source\nlocations and frequencies. Numerical experiments demonstrate the high accuracy\nof both FNO and PFNO with complicated velocity models in the OpenFWI datasets.\nFurthermore, the cross-dataset generalization test verifies that PFNO adapts to\nout-of-distribution velocity models. Also, PFNO has robust performance in the\npresence of random noise in the labels. Finally, PFNO admits higher\ncomputational efficiency on large-scale testing datasets, compared with the\ntraditional finite-difference method. The aforementioned advantages endow the\nFNO-based solver with the potential to build powerful models for research on\nseismic waves.",

    "abstract": "As children grow older, they develop an intuitive understanding of the\nphysical processes around them. They move along developmental trajectories,\nwhich have been mapped out extensively in previous empirical research. We\ninvestigate how children's developmental trajectories compare to the learning\ntrajectories of artificial systems. Specifically, we examine the idea that\ncognitive development results from some form of stochastic optimization\nprocedure. For this purpose, we train a modern generative neural network model\nusing stochastic gradient descent. We then use methods from the developmental\npsychology literature to probe the physical understanding of this model at\ndifferent degrees of optimization. We find that the model's learning trajectory\ncaptures the developmental trajectories of children, thereby providing support\nto the idea of development as stochastic optimization.",

    "title": "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Mesh Refinement",
    "abstract": "Finite element discretizations of problems in computational physics often\nrely on adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) to preferentially resolve regions\ncontaining important features during simulation. However, these spatial\nrefinement strategies are often heuristic and rely on domain-specific knowledge\nor trial-and-error. We treat the process of adaptive mesh refinement as a\nlocal, sequential decision-making problem under incomplete information,\nformulating AMR as a partially observable Markov decision process. Using a deep\nreinforcement learning approach, we train policy networks for AMR strategy\ndirectly from numerical simulation. The training process does not require an\nexact solution or a high-fidelity ground truth to the partial differential\nequation at hand, nor does it require a pre-computed training dataset. The\nlocal nature of our reinforcement learning formulation allows the policy\nnetwork to be trained inexpensively on much smaller problems than those on\nwhich they are deployed. The methodology is not specific to any particular\npartial differential equation, problem dimension, or numerical discretization,\nand can flexibly incorporate diverse problem physics. To that end, we apply the\napproach to a diverse set of partial differential equations, using a variety of\nhigh-order discontinuous Galerkin and hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin\nfinite element discretizations. We show that the resultant deep reinforcement\nlearning policies are competitive with common AMR heuristics, generalize well\nacross problem classes, and strike a favorable balance between accuracy and\ncost such that they often lead to a higher accuracy per problem degree of\nfreedom.",

This is challenging due to\nocclusion between the body and objects, motion blur, depth/scale ambiguities,\nand the low image resolution of hands and graspable object parts. To make the\nproblem tractable, the community focuses either on interacting hands, ignoring\nthe body, or on interacting bodies, ignoring hands. The GRAB dataset addresses\ndexterous whole-body interaction but uses marker-based MoCap and lacks images,\nwhile BEHAVE captures video of body object interaction but lacks hand detail.\nWe address the limitations of prior work with InterCap, a novel method that\nreconstructs interacting whole-bodies and objects from multi-view RGB-D data,\nusing the parametric whole-body model SMPL-X and known object meshes. To tackle\nthe above challenges, InterCap uses two key observations: (i) Contact between\nthe hand and object can be used to improve the pose estimation of both.

Numerous data-driven classification techniques have\ndemonstrated promising results for predicting user intent, but the performance\nof these intent prediction models on novel subjects remains undesirable. In\nother domains (e.g., image classification), transfer learning has improved\nclassification accuracy by using previously learned features from a large\ndataset (i.e., pre-trained models) and then transferring this learned model to\na new task where a smaller dataset is available.

We then apply transfer learning for the subject-independent model\nusing a small portion (10%) of the data from the left-out subject. We compare\nthe performance of these three models.

    "abstract": "Despite substantial progress in deep learning approaches to time-series\nreconstruction, no existing methods are designed to uncover local activities\nwith minute signal strength due to their negligible contribution to the\noptimization loss. Such local activities however can signify important abnormal\nevents in physiological systems, such as an extra foci triggering an abnormal\npropagation of electrical waves in the heart. We discuss a novel technique for\nreconstructing such local activity that, while small in signal strength, is the\ncause of subsequent global activities that have larger signal strength. Our\ncentral innovation is to approach this by explicitly modeling and disentangling\nhow the latent state of a system is influenced by potential hidden internal\ninterventions. In a novel neural formulation of state-space models (SSMs), we\nfirst introduce causal-effect modeling of the latent dynamics via a system of\ninteracting neural ODEs that separately describes 1) the continuous-time\ndynamics of the internal intervention, and 2) its effect on the trajectory of\nthe system's native state. Because the intervention can not be directly\nobserved but have to be disentangled from the observed subsequent effect, we\nintegrate knowledge of the native intervention-free dynamics of a system, and\ninfer the hidden intervention by assuming it to be responsible for differences\nobserved between the actual and hypothetical intervention-free dynamics. We\ndemonstrated a proof-of-concept of the presented framework on reconstructing\nectopic foci disrupting the course of normal cardiac electrical propagation\nfrom remote observations.",

Deep neural network (DNN) based image steganography and\nwatermarking techniques are quickly replacing traditional hand-engineered\npipelines. DNN based watermarking techniques have drastically improved the\nmessage capacity, imperceptibility and robustness of the embedded watermarks.\nHowever, this improvement comes at the cost of increased computational overhead\nof the watermark encoder neural network. In this work, we design the first\naccelerator platform FastStamp to perform DNN based steganography and digital\nwatermarking of images on hardware. We first propose a parameter efficient DNN\nmodel for embedding recoverable bit-strings in image pixels. Our proposed model\ncan match the success metrics of prior state-of-the-art DNN based watermarking\nmethods while being significantly faster and lighter in terms of memory\nfootprint. We then design an FPGA based accelerator framework to further\nimprove the model throughput and power consumption by leveraging data\nparallelism and customized computation paths.

Although a number of works have been conducted and\nachieved huge success in recent, most of them are heuristical, and there lacks\na unified theory for algorithm design. In this work, we fill this blank by\ndeveloping a mutual information theory for deep fair clustering and accordingly\ndesigning a novel algorithm, dubbed FCMI. In brief, through maximizing and\nminimizing mutual information, FCMI is designed to achieve four characteristics\nhighly expected by deep fair clustering, i.e., compact, balanced, and fair\nclusters, as well as informative features. Besides the contributions to theory\nand algorithm, another contribution of this work is proposing a novel fair\nclustering metric built upon information theory as well. Unlike existing\nevaluation metrics, our metric measures the clustering quality and fairness in\na whole instead of separate manner. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed\nFCMI, we carry out experiments on six benchmarks including a single-cell\nRNA-seq atlas compared with 11 state-of-the-art methods in terms of five\nmetrics.

    "abstract": "Deep ensembles have been shown to extend the positive effect seen in typical\nensemble learning to neural networks and to reinforcement learning (RL).\nHowever, there is still much to be done to improve the efficiency of such\nensemble models. In this work, we present Diverse Ensembles for Fast Transfer\nin RL (DEFT), a new ensemble-based method for reinforcement learning in highly\nmultimodal environments and improved transfer to unseen environments. The\nalgorithm is broken down into two main phases: training of ensemble members,\nand synthesis (or fine-tuning) of the ensemble members into a policy that works\nin a new environment.\nThe first phase of the algorithm involves training regular policy gradient or\nactor-critic agents in parallel but adding a term to the loss that encourages\nthese policies to differ from each other. This causes the individual unimodal\nagents to explore the space of optimal policies and capture more of the\nmultimodality of the environment than a single actor could. The second phase of\nDEFT involves synthesizing the component policies into a new policy that works\nwell in a modified environment in one of two ways. To evaluate the performance\nof DEFT, we start with a base version of the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)\nalgorithm and extend it with the modifications for DEFT. Our results show that\nthe pretraining phase is effective in producing diverse policies in multimodal\nenvironments. DEFT often converges to a high reward significantly faster than\nalternatives, such as random initialization without DEFT and fine-tuning of\nensemble members.\nWhile there is certainly more work to be done to analyze DEFT theoretically\nand extend it to be even more robust, we believe it provides a strong framework\nfor capturing multimodality in environments while still using RL methods with\nsimple policy representations.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we present a novel global descriptor termed stable triangle\ndescriptor (STD) for 3D place recognition. For a triangle, its shape is\nuniquely determined by the length of the sides or included angles. Moreover,\nthe shape of triangles is completely invariant to rigid transformations. Based\non this property, we first design an algorithm to efficiently extract local key\npoints from the 3D point cloud and encode these key points into triangular\ndescriptors. Then, place recognition is achieved by matching the side lengths\n(and some other information) of the descriptors between point clouds. The point\ncorrespondence obtained from the descriptor matching pair can be further used\nin geometric verification, which greatly improves the accuracy of place\nrecognition. In our experiments, we extensively compare our proposed system\nagainst other state-of-the-art systems (i.e., M2DP, Scan Context) on public\ndatasets (i.e., KITTI, NCLT, and Complex-Urban) and our self-collected dataset\n(with a non-repetitive scanning solid-state LiDAR).

    "abstract": "Unsupervised anomaly detection is a challenging task in industrial\napplications since it is impracticable to collect sufficient anomalous samples.\nIn this paper, a novel Self-Supervised Guided Segmentation Framework (SGSF) is\nproposed by jointly exploring effective generation method of forged anomalous\nsamples and the normal sample features as the guidance information of\nsegmentation for anomaly detection. Specifically, to ensure that the generated\nforged anomaly samples are conducive to model training, the Saliency\nAugmentation Module (SAM) is proposed. SAM introduces a saliency map to\ngenerate saliency Perlin noise map, and develops an adaptive segmentation\nstrategy to generate irregular masks in the saliency region. Then, the masks\nare utilized to generate forged anomalous samples as negative samples for\ntraining. Unfortunately, the distribution gap between forged and real anomaly\nsamples makes it difficult for models trained based on forged samples to\neffectively locate real anomalies. Towards this end, the Self-supervised\nGuidance Network (SGN) is proposed. It leverages the self-supervised module to\nextract features that are noise-free and contain normal semantic information as\nthe prior knowledge of the segmentation module. The segmentation module with\nthe knowledge of normal patterns segments out the abnormal regions that are\ndifferent from the guidance features. To evaluate the effectiveness of SGSF for\nanomaly detection, extensive experiments are conducted on three anomaly\ndetection datasets. The experimental results show that SGSF achieves\nstate-of-the-art anomaly detection results.",

To obtain more precise\nanomaly localization results and solve the problem of cumulative reconstruction\nerror, a novel Histogram Error Estimation module is proposed to adaptively\neliminate the unfavorable errors by the histogram of the difference image.

We present a novel verification technique,\ncalled full-program induction, for proving (a sub-class of) quantified as well\nas quantifier-free properties of programs manipulating arrays of parametric\nsize $N$. Instead of inducting over individual loops, our technique inducts\nover the entire program (possibly containing multiple loops) directly via the\nprogram parameter $N$.

The\ntransformations assist in effectively reducing the assertion checking problem\nby transforming a program with multiple loops to a program which has fewer and\nsimpler loops or is loop-free. Significantly, full-program induction does not\nrequire generation or use of loop-specific invariants. To assess the efficacy\nof our technique, we have developed a prototype tool called Vajra.

Different types of DDs have been proven to represent important\nfunctions in polynomial space and some types (like Binary Decision\nDiagrams(BDDs)) also allow operations on diagrams in polynomial time. However,\nthere is no type which was proven capable of representing arbitrary boolean\nfunctions in polynomial space with regard to the input size. In particular for\nBDDs it is long known that integer multiplication is one of the functions,\nwhere the output BDDs have exponential size. In this paper, we show that this\nalso holds for an integer addition where one of the operands is shifted to the\nright by an arbitrary value. We call this function the Shifted Addition. Our\ninterest in this function is motivated through its occurrence during the\nfloating point addition.",

    "abstract": "Despite the evolution of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), their\nperformance is surprisingly dependent on the choice of hyperparameters.\nHowever, it remains challenging to efficiently explore large hyperparameter\nsearch space due to the long training times of modern CNNs. Multi-fidelity\noptimization enables the exploration of more hyperparameter configurations\ngiven budget by early termination of unpromising configurations. However, it\noften results in selecting a sub-optimal configuration as training with the\nhigh-performing configuration typically converges slowly in an early phase.

MORL alleviates the problem of slow-starter and achieves a more\nprecise low-fidelity approximation. Our comprehensive experiments on general\nimage classification, transfer learning, and semi-supervised learning\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of MORL over other multi-fidelity optimization\nmethods such as Successive Halving Algorithm (SHA) and Hyperband.

The uptake of OA, the influence of the disciplinary profile of\nuniversities and the influence of transformative agreements is measured by\ncombining several data sources (incl. Web of Science, Unpaywall, an authority\nfile of standardised German affiliation information, the ISSN-Gold-OA 4.0 list,\nand lists of publications covered by transformative agreements). For managerial\nself-governance, a structured data collection was created by harvesting\ndifferent sources of information and by manual online search. To determine the\nexplanatory power of the different factors, a series of regression analyses was\nperformed for different periods and for both Full as well as Hybrid OA. As a\nresult of the regression analyses, the most determining factor for the\nexplanation of differences in the uptake of both OA-types turned out to be\nacademic self-governance. For the year 2020, Hybrid OA transformative\nagreements have become a second relevant factor. However, all variables that\nreflect local infrastructural support and services for OA (managerial\nself-governance) turned out to be non-significant.

    "abstract": "In modern SD-WAN networks, a global controller continuously optimizes\napplication and user intents by selecting the proper routing policies for each\napplication. Nevertheless, the competition between flows can still occur at\neach overlay link and it may degrade Quality of Service (QoS). To mitigate\nperformance degradations in case of congestion, QoS policies can also be\ndynamically optimized to limit the rate of low-priority flows and share the\nbandwidth among all flows in a fair manner. This demonstration presents a\ncomprehensive control plane architecture to coordinate path selection and rate\nallocation, in order to meet application requirements while optimizing a global\nobjective (e.g., low congestion, best quality, and minimum cost).",

    "abstract": "In the Determinant Maximization problem, given an $n\\times n$ positive\nsemi-definite matrix $\\bf{A}$ in $\\mathbb{Q}^{n\\times n}$ and an integer $k$,\nwe are required to find a $k\\times k$ principal submatrix of $\\bf{A}$ having\nthe maximum determinant. This problem is known to be NP-hard and further proven\nto be W[1]-hard with respect to $k$ by Koutis. However, there is still room to\nexplore its parameterized complexity in the restricted case, in the hope of\novercoming the general-case parameterized intractability. In this study, we\nrule out the fixed-parameter tractability of Determinant Maximization even if\nan input matrix is extremely sparse or low rank, or an approximate solution is\nacceptable. We first prove that Determinant Maximization is NP-hard and\nW[1]-hard even if an input matrix is an arrowhead matrix; i.e., the underlying\ngraph formed by nonzero entries is a star, implying that the structural\nsparsity is not helpful. By contrast, we show that Determinant Maximization is\nsolvable in polynomial time on tridiagonal matrices. Thereafter, we demonstrate\nthe W[1]-hardness with respect to the rank $r$ of an input matrix. Our result\nis stronger than Koutis' result in the sense that any $k\\times k$ principal\nsubmatrix is singular whenever $k>r$. We finally give evidence that it is\nW[1]-hard to approximate Determinant Maximization parameterized by $k$ within a\nfactor of $2^{-c\\sqrt{k}}$ for some universal constant $c>0$. Our hardness\nresult is conditional on the Parameterized Inapproximability Hypothesis posed\nby Lokshtanov, Ramanujan, Saurab, and Zehavi, which asserts that a gap version\nof Binary Constraint Satisfaction Problem is W[1]-hard. To complement this\nresult, we develop an $\\epsilon$-additive approximation algorithm that runs in\n$\\epsilon^{-r^2}\\cdot r^{O(r^3)}\\cdot n^{O(1)}$ time for the rank $r$ of an\ninput matrix, provided that the diagonal entries are bounded.",

    "abstract": "Taiwan plans to rapidly increase its industrial production capacity of\nelectronic components while concurrently setting policies for its ecological\ntransition. Given that the island is responsible for the manufacturing of a\nsignificant part of worldwide electronics components, the sustainability of the\nTaiwanese electronics industry is therefore of critical interest. In this\npaper, we survey the environmental footprint of 16 Taiwanese electronic\ncomponents manufacturers (ECM) using corporate sustainability responsibility\nreports (CSR). Based on data from 2015 to 2020, this study finds out that our\nsample of 16 manufacturers increased its greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions by\n7.5\\% per year, its final energy and electricity consumption by 8.8\\% and\n8.9\\%, and the water usage by 6.1\\%. We show that the volume of manufactured\nelectronic components and the environmental footprints compiled in this study\nare strongly correlated, which suggests that relative efficiency gains are not\nsufficient to curb the environmental footprint at the national scale. Given the\ncritical nature of electronics industry for Taiwan's geopolitics and economics,\nthe observed increase of energy consumption and the slow renewable energy\nroll-out, these industrial activities could create a carbon lock-in, blocking\nthe Taiwanese government from achieving its carbon reduction goals and its\nsustainability policies. Besides, the European Union, the USA or even China aim\nat developing an industrial ecosystem targeting sub-10nm CMOS technology nodes\nsimilar to Taiwan. This study thus provides important insights regarding the\nenvironmental implications associated with such a technology roadmap.

    "abstract": "In conventional backscatter communication (BackCom) systems, time division\nmultiple access (TDMA) and frequency division multiple access (FDMA) are\ngenerally adopted for multiuser backscattering due to their simplicity in\nimplementation. However, as the number of backscatter devices (BDs)\nproliferates, there will be a high overhead under the traditional centralized\ncontrol techniques, and the inter-user coordination is unaffordable for the\npassive BDs, which are of scarce concern in existing works and remain unsolved.\nTo this end, in this paper, we propose a slotted ALOHA-based random access for\nBackCom systems, in which each BD is randomly chosen and is allowed to coexist\nwith one active device for hybrid multiple access. To excavate and evaluate the\nperformance, a resource allocation problem for max-min transmission rate is\nformulated, where transmit antenna selection, receive beamforming design,\nreflection coefficient adjustment, power control, and access probability\ndetermination are jointly considered. To deal with this intractable problem, we\nfirst transform the objective function with the max-min form into an equivalent\nlinear one, and then decompose the resulting problem into three sub-problems.\nNext, a block coordinate descent (BCD)-based greedy algorithm with a penalty\nfunction, successive convex approximation, and linear programming are designed\nto obtain sub-optimal solutions for tractable analysis. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms benchmark algorithms in\nterms of transmission rate and fairness.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is increasingly deployed among multiple clients\n(e.g., mobile devices) to train a shared model over decentralized data. To\naddress the privacy concerns, FL systems need to protect the clients' data from\nbeing revealed during training and also control the data leakage through\ntrained models when exposed to untrusted domains. Distributed differential\nprivacy (DP) offers an appealing solution in this regard as it achieves an\ninformed tradeoff between privacy and utility without a trusted server.\nHowever, existing distributed DP mechanisms work impractically in real world.\nFor instance, to handle realistic scenarios with \\emph{client dropout}, these\nexisting mechanisms often make strong assumptions about client participation\nyet still result in either poor privacy guarantees or unsatisfactory training\naccuracy.\nWe present Hyades, a distributed differentially private FL framework that is\nhighly efficient and resilient to client dropout. First, we develop a new\nprivacy accounting technique under the notion of Renyi DP that tightly bounds\nthe privacy loss in the presence of dropout before client sampling in FL. This\nenables Hyades to set a minimum target noise level in each training round.\nSecond, we propose a novel 'add-then-remove' masking scheme to enforce this\ntarget noise level, even though some sampled clients may still drop out in the\nend. Third, we design an efficient secure aggregation mechanism that optimally\npipelines communication and computation for faster execution. Evaluation\nthrough large-scale cloud deployment shows that Hyades can efficiently handle\nclient dropout in various realistic scenarios, attaining the optimal\nprivacy-utility tradeoff and accelerating the training by up to 2.1$\\times$\ncompared to existing solutions.",

A\nconventional generative adversarial network (GAN)-based training algorithm\nsignificantly improves the quality of synthetic speech by reducing the\nstatistical difference between natural and synthetic speech. However, the\nalgorithm does not guarantee the generalization performance of the trained TTS\nmodel in synthesizing voices of unseen speakers who are not included in the\ntraining data. Our algorithm alternatively trains two deep neural networks:\nmulti-task discriminator and multi-speaker neural TTS model (i.e., generator of\nGANs). The discriminator is trained not only to distinguish between natural and\nsynthetic speech but also to verify the speaker of input speech is existent or\nnon-existent (i.e., newly generated by interpolating seen speakers' embedding\nvectors). Meanwhile, the generator is trained to minimize the weighted sum of\nthe speech reconstruction loss and adversarial loss for fooling the\ndiscriminator, which achieves high-quality multi-speaker TTS even if the target\nspeaker is unseen.

Currently, hazard analysis is mainly based on human\nreasoning, past experiences, and simple tools such as checklists and\nspreadsheets. Increasing system complexity makes such approaches decreasingly\nsuitable. Furthermore, testing-based hazard analysis is often not suitable due\nto high costs or dangers of physical faults. A remedy for this are model-based\nhazard analysis methods, which either rely on formal models or on simulation\nmodels, each with their own benefits and drawbacks. This paper proposes a\ntwo-layer approach that combines the benefits of exhaustive analysis using\nformal methods with detailed analysis using simulation. Unsafe behaviours that\nlead to unsafe states are first synthesised from a formal model of the system\nusing Supervisory Control Theory. The result is then input to the simulation\nwhere detailed analyses using domain-specific risk metrics are performed.\nThough the presented approach is generally applicable, this paper demonstrates\nthe benefits of the approach on an industrial human-robot collaboration system.",

This implies\nautomatic resolutions of emotionally charged scheduling conflicts. In the\npresent study, we measured the effects of such a fully automated process on\nworkers' well-being, fairness, and team spirit, and compared them with a more\ninteractive process that directly involves workers in the decision-making. In\nour experimental online study (n = 94), we found positive effects of the more\ninteractive process on all measures. Our findings indicate that full automation\nmay not be desirable from the worker perspective. We close with concrete\nsuggestions to design more worker-centered, hybrid shift planning systems by\noptimizing worker control, considering the worker experience, and embedding\nshift planning in the broader work context.",

Specifically, UAVs can be exploited as aerial base-stations (UAV-BS)\nfor supporting legitimate ground users in remote uncovered areas or in\nenvironments temporarily requiring high capacity. However, their communication\nperformance is prone to both channel estimation errors and potential\neavesdropping. Hence, we investigate the effective secrecy throughput of the\nUAV-aided uplink, in which rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) is employed by\neach legitimate user for secure transmission under the scenario of massive\naccess. To maximize the effective network secrecy throughput in the uplink, the\ntransmission rate vs. power allocation relationship is formulated as a max-min\noptimization problem, relying on realistic imperfect CSI of both the legitimate\nusers and of the potential eavesdroppers (Eves). We then propose a novel\ntransformation of the associated probabilistic constraints for decoupling the\nvariables, so that our design problem can be solved by alternatively activating\nthe related block coordinate decent programming. In the model considered, each\nuser transmits a superposition of two messages to a UAV-BS, each having\ndifferent transmit power and the UAV-BS uses a SIC technique to decode the\nreceived messages. Given the non-convexity of the problem, it is decoupled into\na pair of sub-problems. In particular, we derive a closed form expression for\nthe optimal rate-splitting fraction of each user. Then, given the optimal\nrate-splitting fraction of each user, the \\epsilon-constrainted transmit power\nof each user is calculated by harnessing SPCA programming.",

Most of the pretrained speaker embeddings are trained on\nEnglish corpora, because it is easily accessible. Thus, language dependency can\nbe an important factor in automatic forensic voice comparison, especially when\nthe target language is linguistically very different. There are numerous\ncommercial systems available, but their models are mainly trained on a\ndifferent language (mostly English) than the target language. In the case of a\nlow-resource language, developing a corpus for forensic purposes containing\nenough speakers to train deep learning models is costly. This study aims to\ninvestigate whether a model pre-trained on English corpus can be used on a\ntarget low-resource language (here, Hungarian), different from the model is\ntrained on. Also, often multiple samples are not available from the offender\n(unknown speaker). Therefore, samples are compared pairwise with and without\nspeaker enrollment for suspect (known) speakers. Two corpora are applied that\nwere developed especially for forensic purposes, and a third that is meant for\ntraditional speaker verification. Two deep learning based speaker embedding\nvector extraction methods are used: the x-vector and ECAPA-TDNN. Speaker\nverification was evaluated in the likelihood-ratio framework.

Conducting experiments to\nestimate mechanical properties in MAM processes, however, is a laborious and\nexpensive task. Also, they can solely be designed for a particular material in\na certain MAM process. Nonetheless, Machine learning (ML) methods, which are\nmore flexible and cost-effective solutions, can be utilized to predict\nmechanical properties based on the processing parameters and material\nproperties. To this end, in this work, a comprehensive framework for\nbenchmarking ML for mechanical properties is introduced.

Motivated by this bound, we\nderive an SSL objective that minimizes the largest inconsistency between an\noriginal unlabeled sample and its multiple augmented variants. We then provide\na simple but effective algorithm to solve the proposed minimax problem, and\ntheoretically prove that it converges to a stationary point. Experiments on\nfive popular benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed\nmethod.",

    "abstract": "Recent models can generate fluent and grammatical synthetic reviews while\naccurately predicting user ratings. The generated reviews, expressing users'\nestimated opinions towards related products, are often viewed as natural\nlanguage 'rationales' for the jointly predicted rating. However, previous\nstudies found that existing models often generate repetitive, universally\napplicable, and generic explanations, resulting in uninformative rationales.\nFurther, our analysis shows that previous models' generated content often\ncontain factual hallucinations. These issues call for novel solutions that\ncould generate both informative and factually grounded explanations. Inspired\nby recent success in using retrieved content in addition to parametric\nknowledge for generation, we propose to augment the generator with a\npersonalized retriever, where the retriever's output serves as external\nknowledge for enhancing the generator. Experiments on Yelp, TripAdvisor, and\nAmazon Movie Reviews dataset show our model could generate explanations that\nmore reliably entail existing reviews, are more diverse, and are rated more\ninformative by human evaluators.",

Recently, visual representations by\nself-supervised learning have greatly improved the performance of image\nclustering.

For\nranking the samples, we developed a method for computing the likelihood of\nsamples belonging to the current clusters based on whether they are situated in\ndensely populated neighborhoods, while for training the model, we give a\nstrategy for weighting the ranked samples.

    "abstract": "Power system state estimation is being faced with different types of\nanomalies. These might include bad data caused by gross measurement errors or\ncommunication system failures. Sudden changes in load or generation can be\nconsidered as anomaly depending on the implemented state estimation method.\nAdditionally, considering power grid as a cyber physical system, state\nestimation becomes vulnerable to false data injection attacks. The existing\nmethods for anomaly classification cannot accurately classify (discriminate\nbetween) the above-mentioned three types of anomalies, especially when it comes\nto discrimination between sudden load changes and false data injection attacks.\nThis paper presents a new algorithm for detecting anomaly presence, classifying\nthe anomaly type and identifying the origin of the anomaly, i.e., measurements\nthat contain gross errors in case of bad data, or bus(es) associated with\nload(s) experiencing a sudden change, or state variables targeted by false data\ninjection attack. The algorithm combines analytical and machine learning (ML)\napproaches. The first stage exploits an analytical approach to detect anomaly\npresence by combining $\\chi^2$-test and anomaly detection index. The second\nstage utilizes ML for the classification of anomaly type and identification of\nits origin, with particular reference to discrimination between sudden load\nchanges and false data injection attacks. The proposed ML based method is\ntrained to be independent of the network configuration which eliminates\nretraining of the algorithm after network topology changes. The results\nobtained by implementing the proposed algorithm on IEEE 14 bus test system\ndemonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new low-rank matrix factorization model dubbed\nbounded simplex-structured matrix factorization (BSSMF). Given an input matrix\n$X$ and a factorization rank $r$, BSSMF looks for a matrix $W$ with $r$ columns\nand a matrix $H$ with $r$ rows such that $X \\approx WH$ where the entries in\neach column of $W$ are bounded, that is, they belong to given intervals, and\nthe columns of $H$ belong to the probability simplex, that is, $H$ is column\nstochastic. BSSMF generalizes nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), and\nsimplex-structured matrix factorization (SSMF). BSSMF is particularly well\nsuited when the entries of the input matrix $X$ belong to a given interval; for\nexample when the rows of $X$ represent images, or $X$ is a rating matrix such\nas in the Netflix and MovieLens data sets where the entries of $X$ belong to\nthe interval $[1,5]$. The simplex-structured matrix $H$ not only leads to an\neasily understandable decomposition providing a soft clustering of the columns\nof $X$, but implies that the entries of each column of $WH$ belong to the same\nintervals as the columns of $W$. In this paper, we first propose a fast\nalgorithm for BSSMF, even in the presence of missing data in $X$. Then we\nprovide identifiability conditions for BSSMF, that is, we provide conditions\nunder which BSSMF admits a unique decomposition, up to trivial ambiguities.\nFinally, we illustrate the effectiveness of BSSMF on two applications:\nextraction of features in a set of images, and the matrix completion problem\nfor recommender systems.",

First, we introduce\nand formalise two variants of Defeasible Deontic Logic with Meta-Rules to\nrepresent (1) defeasible meta-theories with deontic modalities, and (2) two\ndifferent types of conflicts among rules: Simple Conflict Defeasible Deontic\nLogic, and Cautious Conflict Defeasible Deontic Logic.

A core challenge is to infer user\nintent from user input and chose adaptations accordingly. Designing effective\nonline UI adaptations is challenging because it relies on tediously\nhand-crafted rules or carefully collected, high-quality user data. To overcome\nthese challenges, we formulate UI adaptation as a multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning problem. In our formulation, a user agent learns to interact with a UI\nto complete a task. Simultaneously, an interface agent learns UI adaptations to\nmaximize the user agent's performance. The interface agent is agnostic to the\ngoal. It learns the task structure from the behavior of the user agent and\nbased on that can support the user agent in completing its task. We show that\nour approach leads to a significant reduction in necessary number of actions on\na photo editing task in silico.

    "abstract": "Over the last few decades, extensive use of information and communication\ntechnologies has been the main driver of the digitalization of power systems.\nProper and secure monitoring of the critical grid infrastructure became an\nintegral part of the modern power system. Using phasor measurement units (PMUs)\nto surveil the power system is one of the technologies that have a promising\nfuture. Increased frequency of measurements and smarter methods for data\nhandling can improve the ability to reliably operate power grids. The increased\ncyber-physical interaction offers both benefits and drawbacks, where one of the\ndrawbacks comes in the form of anomalies in the measurement data. The anomalies\ncan be caused by both physical faults on the power grid, as well as\ndisturbances, errors, and cyber attacks in the cyber layer. This paper aims to\ndevelop a hybrid AI-based model that is based on various methods such as Long\nShort Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and other relevant\nhybrid algorithms for anomaly detection in phasor measurement unit data. The\ndataset used within this research was acquired by the University of Texas,\nwhich consists of real data from grid measurements. In addition to the real\ndata, false data that has been injected to produce anomalies has been analyzed.\nThe impacts and mitigating methods to prevent such kind of anomalies are\ndiscussed.",

The flexible\nnature of zero-shot learning is appealing for this task because it allows\nclassifiers to naturally adapt to taxonomy modifications. This work studies\nzero-shot multi-label document classification with fine-tuned language models\nunder realistic taxonomy expansion scenarios in the human resource domain.\nExperiments show that zero-shot learning can be highly effective in this\nsetting. When controlling for training data budget, zero-shot classifiers\nachieve a 12% relative increase in macro-AP when compared to a traditional\nmulti-label classifier trained on all classes. Counterintuitively, these\nresults suggest in some settings it would be preferable to adopt zero-shot\ntechniques and spend resources annotating more documents with an incomplete set\nof classes, rather than spreading the labeling budget uniformly over all\nclasses and using traditional classification techniques. Additional experiments\ndemonstrate that adopting the well-known filter/re-rank decomposition from the\nrecommender systems literature can significantly reduce the computational\nburden of high-performance zero-shot classifiers, empirically resulting in a\n98% reduction in computational overhead for only a 2% relative decrease in\nperformance.

    "abstract": "In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), combining value\ndecomposition with actor-critic enables agents to learn stochastic policies,\nwhich are more suitable for the partially observable environment. Given the\ngoal of learning local policies that enable decentralized execution, agents are\ncommonly assumed to be independent of each other, even in centralized training.\nHowever, such an assumption may prohibit agents from learning the optimal joint\npolicy. To address this problem, we explicitly take the dependency among agents\ninto centralized training. Although this leads to the optimal joint policy, it\nmay not be factorized for decentralized execution. Nevertheless, we\ntheoretically show that from such a joint policy, we can always derive another\njoint policy that achieves the same optimality but can be factorized for\ndecentralized execution. To this end, we propose multi-agent conditional policy\nfactorization (MACPF), which takes more centralized training but still enables\ndecentralized execution. We empirically verify MACPF in various cooperative\nMARL tasks and demonstrate that MACPF achieves better performance or faster\nconvergence than baselines.",

    "abstract": "Stereo matching is a fundamental building block for many vision and robotics\napplications. An informative and concise cost volume representation is vital\nfor stereo matching of high accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we present\na novel cost volume construction method, named attention concatenation volume\n(ACV), which generates attention weights from correlation clues to suppress\nredundant information and enhance matching-related information in the\nconcatenation volume. The ACV can be seamlessly embedded into most stereo\nmatching networks, the resulting networks can use a more lightweight\naggregation network and meanwhile achieve higher accuracy. We further design a\nfast version of ACV to enable real-time performance, named Fast-ACV, which\ngenerates high likelihood disparity hypotheses and the corresponding attention\nweights from low-resolution correlation clues to significantly reduce\ncomputational and memory cost and meanwhile maintain a satisfactory accuracy.\nThe core idea of our Fast-ACV is volume attention propagation (VAP) which can\nautomatically select accurate correlation values from an upsampled correlation\nvolume and propagate these accurate values to the surroundings pixels with\nambiguous correlation clues. Furthermore, we design a highly accurate network\nACVNet and a real-time network Fast-ACVNet based on our ACV and Fast-ACV\nrespectively, which achieve the state-of-the-art performance on several\nbenchmarks (i.e., our ACVNet ranks the 2nd on KITTI 2015 and Scene Flow, and\nthe 3rd on KITTI 2012 and ETH3D among all the published methods; our\nFast-ACVNet outperforms almost all state-of-the-art real-time methods on Scene\nFlow, KITTI 2012 and 2015 and meanwhile has better generalization ability)",

    "abstract": "Transformer verification draws increasing attention in machine learning\nresearch and industry. It formally verifies the robustness of transformers\nagainst adversarial attacks such as exchanging words in a sentence with\nsynonyms. However, the performance of transformer verification is still not\nsatisfactory due to bound-centric computation which is significantly different\nfrom standard neural networks. In this paper, we propose Faith, an efficient\nframework for transformer verification on GPUs. We first propose a\nsemantic-aware computation graph transformation to identify semantic\ninformation such as bound computation in transformer verification. We exploit\nsuch semantic information to enable efficient kernel fusion at the computation\ngraph level. Second, we propose a verification-specialized kernel crafter to\nefficiently map transformer verification to modern GPUs. This crafter exploits\na set of GPU hardware supports to accelerate verification specialized\noperations which are usually memory-intensive. Third, we propose an\nexpert-guided autotuning to incorporate expert knowledge on GPU backends to\nfacilitate large search space exploration. Extensive evaluations show that\nFaith achieves $2.1\\times$ to $3.4\\times$ ($2.6\\times$ on average) speedup over\nstate-of-the-art frameworks.",

We evaluate 9 different tasks with negated prompts on (1)\npretrained LMs (OPT & GPT-3) of varying sizes (125M - 175B), (2) LMs further\npretrained to generalize to novel prompts (InstructGPT), (3) LMs provided with\nfew-shot examples, and (4) LMs fine-tuned specifically on negated prompts; all\nLM types perform worse on negated prompts as they scale and show a huge\nperformance gap between the human performance when comparing the average score\non both original and negated prompts. By highlighting a critical limitation of\nexisting LMs and methods, we urge the community to develop new approaches of\ndeveloping LMs that actually follow the given instructions.

    "abstract": "Communication helps agents to obtain information about others so that better\ncoordinated behavior can be learned. Some existing work communicates predicted\nfuture trajectory with others, hoping to get clues about what others would do\nfor better coordination. However, circular dependencies sometimes can occur\nwhen agents are treated synchronously so it is hard to coordinate\ndecision-making. In this paper, we propose a novel communication scheme,\nSequential Communication (SeqComm). SeqComm treats agents asynchronously (the\nupper-level agents make decisions before the lower-level ones) and has two\ncommunication phases. In negotiation phase, agents determine the priority of\ndecision-making by communicating hidden states of observations and comparing\nthe value of intention, which is obtained by modeling the environment dynamics.\nIn launching phase, the upper-level agents take the lead in making decisions\nand communicate their actions with the lower-level agents. Theoretically, we\nprove the policies learned by SeqComm are guaranteed to improve monotonically\nand converge. Empirically, we show that SeqComm outperforms existing methods in\nvarious multi-agent cooperative tasks.",

In recent decades, deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs) have been widely used for image denoising.

To mitigate these issues, we introduce a new self-supervised\nframework for image denoising based on the Tucker low-rank tensor\napproximation.

Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world noisy\nimages have been conducted.

We consider both\nthe point and extended target models. For the point target case, the BS\nestimates the target angle and we adopt the Cram\\'er-Rao bound (CRB) for angle\nestimation as the sensing performance metric. For the extended target case, the\nBS estimates the complete target response matrix, and we consider three\ndifferent sensing performance metrics including the trace, the maximum\neigenvalue, and the determinant of the CRB matrix for target response matrix\nestimation. For each of the four scenarios with different CRB measures, we\ninvestigate the fundamental tradeoff between the CRB for estimation and the\ndata rate for communication, by characterizing the Pareto boundary of the\nachievable CRB-rate (C-R) region. In particular, we formulate a new MIMO rate\nmaximization problem for each scenario, by optimizing the transmit covariance\nmatrix at the BS, subject to a different form of maximum CRB constraint and its\nmaximum transmit power constraint. For these problems, we obtain their optimal\nsolutions in semi-closed forms by using advanced convex optimization\ntechniques.

Therefore, it is more logical to compare effectiveness of ML\nmodels on individual instances instead of comparing scores obtained for the\nentire dataset. In this paper, an alternative approach is proposed for direct\ncomparison of supervised ML models in terms of individual instances within the\ndataset. A direct comparison matrix called \\emph{Prayatul Matrix} is\nintroduced, which accounts for comparative outcome of two ML algorithms on\ndifferent instances of a dataset. Five different performance measures are\ndesigned based on prayatul matrix. Efficacy of the proposed approach as well as\ndesigned measures is analyzed with four classification techniques on three\ndatasets. Also analyzed on four large-scale complex image datasets with four\ndeep learning models namely ResNet50V2, MobileNetV2, EfficientNet, and\nXceptionNet.

The first\nstep is Image Embedding, in which an encoder or optimization process embeds\nimages to get the corresponding latent codes. Afterward, the second step aims\nto refine the inversion and editing results, which we named Result Refinement.\nAlthough the second step significantly improves fidelity, perception and\neditability are almost unchanged, deeply dependent on inverse latent codes\nattained in the first step. Therefore, a crucial problem is gaining the latent\ncodes with better perception and editability while retaining the reconstruction\nfidelity. In this work, we first point out that these two characteristics are\nrelated to the degree of alignment (or disalignment) of the inverse codes with\nthe synthetic distribution. Then, we propose Latent Space Alignment Inversion\nParadigm (LSAP), which consists of evaluation metric and solution for this\nproblem.

    "abstract": "Vehicular edge computing (VEC) becomes a promising paradigm for the\ndevelopment of emerging intelligent transportation systems. Nevertheless, the\nlimited resources and massive transmission demands bring great challenges on\nimplementing vehicular applications with stringent deadline requirements. This\nwork presents a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based architecture in\nVEC, where heterogeneous edge nodes are cooperated for real-time task\nprocessing. We derive a vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) transmission model by\nconsidering both intra-edge and inter-edge interferences and formulate a\ncooperative resource optimization (CRO) problem by jointly optimizing the task\noffloading and resource allocation, aiming at maximizing the service ratio.\nFurther, we decompose the CRO into two subproblems, namely, task offloading and\nresource allocation. In particular, the task offloading subproblem is modeled\nas an exact potential game (EPG), and a multi-agent distributed distributional\ndeep deterministic policy gradient (MAD4PG) is proposed to achieve the Nash\nequilibrium. The resource allocation subproblem is divided into two independent\nconvex optimization problems, and an optimal solution is proposed by using a\ngradient-based iterative method and KKT condition. Finally, we build the\nsimulation model based on real-world vehicle trajectories and give a\ncomprehensive performance evaluation, which conclusively demonstrates the\nsuperiority of the proposed solutions.",

CSGMs model the probability density functions as\nBoltzmann distributions, and assign their predictions as the negative gradients\nof some scalar-valued energy functions. On the other hand, USGMs employ\nflexible architectures capable of directly estimating scores without the need\nto explicitly model energy functions. In this paper, we demonstrate that the\narchitectural constraints of CSGMs may limit their score-matching ability. In\naddition, we show that USGMs' inability to preserve the property of\nconservativeness may lead to serious sampling inefficiency and degraded\nsampling performance in practice. To address the above issues, we propose\nQuasi-Conservative Score-based Generative Models (QCSGMs) for keeping the\nadvantages of both CSGMs and USGMs. Our theoretical derivations demonstrate\nthat the training objective of QCSGMs can be efficiently integrated into the\ntraining processes by leveraging the Hutchinson trace estimator.

    "abstract": "In the literature, several active learning techniques have been proposed for\nreducing the cost of data annotation. However, it is questionable whether the\nsample selection is fair with respect to sensitive attributes. Even when the\nactive learning model considers fairness, it comes with a cost of reduced\naccuracy performance. Thus, it remains an open challenge to design an active\nlearning algorithm that can maintain performance as well as fairness to\nunderprivileged groups. This paper presents a novel active learning strategy\ncalled Fair Active Learning using fair Clustering, Uncertainty, and\nRepresentativeness (FAL-CUR) that provides a high accuracy while maintaining\nfairness during the sample acquisition phase. We introduce the FAL-CUR sample\nacquisition function that computes each sample's representative score based on\nthe uncertainty and similarity score for sample selection. This acquisition\nfunction is added on top of the fair clustering method to add fairness\nconstraints to the active learning method. We perform extensive experiments on\nfour real-world datasets to compare the performance of the proposed methods.\nThe experimental results show that the FAL-CUR algorithm maintains the\nperformance accuracy while achieving high fairness measures and outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods on well-known fair active learning problems.",

The computational requirements of the\nforward uncertainty propagation problem, which must solve numerous\nsecurity-constrained economic dispatch (SCED) optimizations, is a major barrier\nfor such real-time risk assessment. This paper proposes a Just-In-Time Risk\nAssessment Learning Framework (JITRALF) as an alternative. JITRALF trains risk\nsurrogates, one for each hour in the day, using Machine Learning (ML) to\npredict the quantities needed to estimate risk, without explicitly solving the\nSCED problem. This significantly reduces the computational burden of the\nforward uncertainty propagation and allows for fast, real-time risk estimation.\nThe paper also proposes a novel, asymmetric loss function and shows that models\ntrained using the asymmetric loss perform better than those using symmetric\nloss functions. JITRALF is evaluated on the French transmission system for\nassessing the risk of insufficient operating reserves, the risk of load\nshedding, and the expected operating cost.",

However, existing\nfunctional registration algorithms are computationally expensive. Furthermore,\nthe capability of registration with unknown scale is necessary in tasks such as\nCAD model-based object localization, yet no such support exists in functional\nregistration. In this work, we propose a scale-invariant, linear time\ncomplexity functional registration algorithm. We achieve linear time complexity\nthrough an efficient approximation of L2-distance between functions using\northonormal basis functions. The use of orthonormal basis functions leads to a\nformulation that is compatible with least-squares registration. Benefited from\nthe least-square formulation, we use the theory of\ntranslation-rotation-invariant measurement to decouple scale estimation and\ntherefore achieve scale-invariant registration. We evaluate the proposed\nalgorithm, named FLS (functional least-squares), on standard 3D registration\nbenchmarks, showing FLS is an order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art\nfunctional registration algorithm without compromising accuracy and robustness.\nFLS also outperforms state-of-the-art correspondence-based least-squares\nregistration algorithm on accuracy and robustness, with known and unknown\nscale.

    "abstract": "3D point clouds have attracted increasing attention in architecture,\nengineering, and construction due to their high-quality object representation\nand efficient acquisition methods. Consequently, many point cloud feature\ndetection methods have been proposed in the literature to automate some\nworkflows, such as their classification or part segmentation. Nevertheless, the\nperformance of point cloud automated systems significantly lags behind their\nimage counterparts. While part of this failure stems from the irregularity,\nunstructuredness, and disorder of point clouds, which makes the task of point\ncloud feature detection significantly more challenging than the image one, we\nargue that a lack of inspiration from the image domain might be the primary\ncause of such a gap. Indeed, given the overwhelming success of Convolutional\nNeural Networks (CNNs) in image feature detection, it seems reasonable to\ndesign their point cloud counterparts, but none of the proposed approaches\nclosely resembles them. Specifically, even though many approaches generalise\nthe convolution operation in point clouds, they fail to emulate the CNNs\nmultiple-feature detection and pooling operations. For this reason, we propose\na graph convolution-based unit, dubbed Shrinking unit, that can be stacked\nvertically and horizontally for the design of CNN-like 3D point cloud feature\nextractors. Given that self, local and global correlations between points in a\npoint cloud convey crucial spatial geometric information, we also leverage them\nduring the feature extraction process. We evaluate our proposal by designing a\nfeature extractor model for the ModelNet-10 benchmark dataset and achieve\n90.64% classification accuracy, demonstrating that our innovative idea is\neffective.

    "abstract": "Language models (LMs) trained on raw texts have no direct access to the\nphysical world. Gordon and Van Durme (2013) point out that LMs can thus suffer\nfrom reporting bias: texts rarely report on common facts, instead focusing on\nthe unusual aspects of a situation. If LMs are only trained on text corpora and\nnaively memorise local co-occurrence statistics, they thus naturally would\nlearn a biased view of the physical world. While prior studies have repeatedly\nverified that LMs of smaller scales (e.g., RoBERTa, GPT-2) amplify reporting\nbias, it remains unknown whether such trends continue when models are scaled\nup. We investigate reporting bias from the perspective of colour in larger\nlanguage models (LLMs) such as PaLM and GPT-3. Specifically, we query LLMs for\nthe typical colour of objects, which is one simple type of perceptually\ngrounded physical common sense. Surprisingly, we find that LLMs significantly\noutperform smaller LMs in determining an object's typical colour and more\nclosely track human judgments, instead of overfitting to surface patterns\nstored in texts. This suggests that very large models of language alone are\nable to overcome certain types of reporting bias that are characterized by\nlocal co-occurrences.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we empirically study how to make the most of low-resolution\nframes for efficient video recognition. Existing methods mainly focus on\ndeveloping compact networks or alleviating temporal redundancy of video inputs\nto increase efficiency, whereas compressing frame resolution has rarely been\nconsidered a promising solution. A major concern is the poor recognition\naccuracy on low-resolution frames. We thus start by analyzing the underlying\ncauses of performance degradation on low-resolution frames. Our key finding is\nthat the major cause of degradation is not information loss in the\ndown-sampling process, but rather the mismatch between network architecture and\ninput scale. Motivated by the success of knowledge distillation (KD), we\npropose to bridge the gap between network and input size via cross-resolution\nKD (ResKD). Our work shows that ResKD is a simple but effective method to boost\nrecognition accuracy on low-resolution frames. Without bells and whistles,\nResKD considerably surpasses all competitive methods in terms of efficiency and\naccuracy on four large-scale benchmark datasets, i.e., ActivityNet, FCVID,\nMini-Kinetics, Something-Something V2. In addition, we extensively demonstrate\nits effectiveness over state-of-the-art architectures, i.e., 3D-CNNs and Video\nTransformers, and scalability towards super low-resolution frames. The results\nsuggest ResKD can serve as a general inference acceleration method for\nstate-of-the-art video recognition. Our code will be available at\nhttps://github.com/CVMI-Lab/ResKD.",

    "abstract": "Outlier detection tasks have been playing a critical role in AI safety. There\nhas been a great challenge to deal with this task. Observations show that deep\nneural network classifiers usually tend to incorrectly classify\nout-of-distribution (OOD) inputs into in-distribution classes with high\nconfidence. Existing works attempt to solve the problem by explicitly imposing\nuncertainty on classifiers when OOD inputs are exposed to the classifier during\ntraining. In this paper, we propose an alternative probabilistic paradigm that\nis both practically useful and theoretically viable for the OOD detection\ntasks. Particularly, we impose statistical independence between inlier and\noutlier data during training, in order to ensure that inlier data reveals\nlittle information about OOD data to the deep estimator during training.\nSpecifically, we estimate the statistical dependence between inlier and outlier\ndata through the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), and we penalize\nsuch metric during training. We also associate our approach with a novel\nstatistical test during the inference time coupled with our principled\nmotivation. Empirical results show that our method is effective and robust for\nOOD detection on various benchmarks.

This paper mainly details a structural result and\nan algorithmic result that were presented in conferences by the same authors,\nin 2020 and 2021 respectively. It also provides a more general framework to\nstudy Maker-Breaker games, centered on the notion of danger, which is a\nsubhypergraph representing an urgent threat for Breaker that he must hit with\nhis next pick. Applying this concept in 3-uniform hypergraphs, we exhibit an\nelementary family of dangers $\\mathcal{D}_0$ such that Breaker wins with\nperfect play if and only if he can hit all dangers from $\\mathcal{D}_0$ in each\nof the first three rounds. This structural criterion has consequences on the\nalgorithmic complexity of deciding which player has a winning strategy on a\ngiven hypergraph: this problem, which is known to be PSPACE-complete on\n6-uniform hypergraphs, is in polynomial time on hypergraphs of rank 3. This\nimproves on a result by Kutz who showed the same in the linear case, and\nvalidates a conjecture by Rahman and Watson.

    "abstract": "The common approach for local navigation on challenging environments with\nlegged robots requires path planning, path following and locomotion, which\nusually requires a locomotion control policy that accurately tracks a commanded\nvelocity. However, by breaking down the navigation problem into these\nsub-tasks, we limit the robot's capabilities since the individual tasks do not\nconsider the full solution space. In this work, we propose to solve the\ncomplete problem by training an end-to-end policy with deep reinforcement\nlearning. Instead of continuously tracking a precomputed path, the robot needs\nto reach a target position within a provided time. The task's success is only\nevaluated at the end of an episode, meaning that the policy does not need to\nreach the target as fast as possible. It is free to select its path and the\nlocomotion gait. Training a policy in this way opens up a larger set of\npossible solutions, which allows the robot to learn more complex behaviors. We\ncompare our approach to velocity tracking and additionally show that the time\ndependence of the task reward is critical to successfully learn these new\nbehaviors. Finally, we demonstrate the successful deployment of policies on a\nreal quadrupedal robot. The robot is able to cross challenging terrains, which\nwere not possible previously, while using a more energy-efficient gait and\nachieving a higher success rate.",

    "title": "Adaptation of Autoencoder for Sparsity Reduction From Clinical Notes  Representation Learning",
    "abstract": "When dealing with clinical text classification on a small dataset recent\nstudies have confirmed that a well-tuned multilayer perceptron outperforms\nother generative classifiers, including deep learning ones. To increase the\nperformance of the neural network classifier, feature selection for the\nlearning representation can effectively be used. However, most feature\nselection methods only estimate the degree of linear dependency between\nvariables and select the best features based on univariate statistical tests.\nFurthermore, the sparsity of the feature space involved in the learning\nrepresentation is ignored. Goal: Our aim is therefore to access an alternative\napproach to tackle the sparsity by compressing the clinical representation\nfeature space, where limited French clinical notes can also be dealt with\neffectively. Methods: This study proposed an autoencoder learning algorithm to\ntake advantage of sparsity reduction in clinical note representation. The\nmotivation was to determine how to compress sparse, high-dimensional data by\nreducing the dimension of the clinical note representation feature space. The\nclassification performance of the classifiers was then evaluated in the trained\nand compressed feature space. Results: The proposed approach provided overall\nperformance gains of up to 3% for each evaluation. Finally, the classifier\nachieved a 92% accuracy, 91% recall, 91% precision, and 91% f1-score in\ndetecting the patient's condition. Furthermore, the compression working\nmechanism and the autoencoder prediction process were demonstrated by applying\nthe theoretic information bottleneck framework.",

    "abstract": "Multi-agent collaborative perception could significantly upgrade the\nperception performance by enabling agents to share complementary information\nwith each other through communication. It inevitably results in a fundamental\ntrade-off between perception performance and communication bandwidth. To tackle\nthis bottleneck issue, we propose a spatial confidence map, which reflects the\nspatial heterogeneity of perceptual information. It empowers agents to only\nshare spatially sparse, yet perceptually critical information, contributing to\nwhere to communicate. Based on this novel spatial confidence map, we propose\nWhere2comm, a communication-efficient collaborative perception framework.\nWhere2comm has two distinct advantages: i) it considers pragmatic compression\nand uses less communication to achieve higher perception performance by\nfocusing on perceptually critical areas; and ii) it can handle varying\ncommunication bandwidth by dynamically adjusting spatial areas involved in\ncommunication. To evaluate Where2comm, we consider 3D object detection in both\nreal-world and simulation scenarios with two modalities (camera/LiDAR) and two\nagent types (cars/drones) on four datasets: OPV2V, V2X-Sim, DAIR-V2X, and our\noriginal CoPerception-UAVs.

Such properties are particularly\nuseful for some dense prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation. The key\nidea of our formulation is to generate similarity-aware kernels by comparing\nthe similarity between each encoder feature point and the spatially associated\nlocal region of decoder features. In this way, the encoder feature point can\nfunction as a cue to inform the semantic cluster of upsampled feature points.\nTo embody the formulation, we further instantiate a lightweight upsampling\noperator, termed Similarity-Aware Point Affiliation (SAPA), and investigate its\nvariants.

    "abstract": "Operator networks have emerged as promising deep learning tools for\napproximating the solution to partial differential equations (PDEs). These\nnetworks map input functions that describe material properties, forcing\nfunctions and boundary data to the solution of a PDE. This work describes a new\narchitecture for operator networks that mimics the form of the numerical\nsolution obtained from an approximation of the variational or weak formulation\nof the problem. The application of these ideas to a generic elliptic PDE leads\nto a variationally mimetic operator network (VarMiON). Like the conventional\nDeep Operator Network (DeepONet) the VarMiON is also composed of a sub-network\nthat constructs the basis functions for the output and another that constructs\nthe coefficients for these basis functions. However, in contrast to the\nDeepONet, in the VarMiON the architecture of these networks is precisely\ndetermined. An analysis of the error in the VarMiON solution reveals that it\ncontains contributions from the error in the training data, the training error,\nquadrature error in sampling input and output functions, and a \"covering error\"\nthat measures the distance between the test input functions and the nearest\nfunctions in the training dataset. It also depends on the stability constants\nfor the exact network and its VarMiON approximation. The application of the\nVarMiON to a canonical elliptic PDE reveals that for approximately the same\nnumber of network parameters, on average the VarMiON incurs smaller errors than\na standard DeepONet. Further, its performance is more robust to variations in\ninput functions, the techniques used to sample the input and output functions,\nthe techniques used to construct the basis functions, and the number of input\nfunctions.",

    "abstract": "In the decision tree computation model for Boolean functions, the depth\ncorresponds to query complexity, and size corresponds to storage space. The\ndepth measure is the most well-studied one, and is known to be polynomially\nrelated to several non-computational complexity measures of functions such as\ncertificate complexity. The size measure is also studied, but to a lesser\nextent. Another decision tree measure that has received very little attention\nis the minimal rank of the decision tree, first introduced by Ehrenfeucht and\nHaussler in 1989. This measure is closely related to the logarithm of the size,\nbut is not polynomially related to depth, and hence it can reveal additional\ninformation about the complexity of a function. It is characterised by the\nvalue of a Prover-Delayer game first proposed by Pudl\\'ak and Impagliazzo in\nthe context of tree-like resolution proofs. In this paper we study this measure\nfurther. We obtain an upper bound on depth in terms of rank and Fourier\nsparsity. We obtain upper and lower bounds on rank in terms of (variants of)\ncertificate complexity. We also obtain upper and lower bounds on the rank for\ncomposed functions in terms of the depth of the outer function and the rank of\nthe inner function. This allow us to easily recover known asympotical lower\nbounds on logarithm of the size for Iterated AND-OR and Iterated 3-bit\nMajority. We compute the rank exactly for several natural functions and use\nthem to show that all the bounds we have obtained are tight. We also show that\nrank in the simple decision tree model can be used to bound query complexity,\nor depth, in the more general conjunctive decision tree model. Finally, we\nimprove upon the known size lower bound for the Tribes function and conclude\nthat in the size-rank relationship for decision trees, obtained by Ehrenfeucht\nand Haussler, the upper bound for Tribes is asymptotically tight.",

    "abstract": "Training deep reinforcement learning (DRL) locomotion policies often requires\nmassive amounts of data to converge to the desired behavior. In this regard,\nsimulators provide a cheap and abundant source. For successful sim-to-real\ntransfer, exhaustively engineered approaches such as system identification,\ndynamics randomization, and domain adaptation are generally employed. As an\nalternative, we investigate a simple strategy of random force injection (RFI)\nto perturb system dynamics during training.

We\nfurther extend RFI, referred to as extended random force injection (ERFI), by\nintroducing an episodic actuation offset.

    "abstract": "Leveraging multi-modal fusion, especially between camera and LiDAR, has\nbecome essential for building accurate and robust 3D object detection systems\nfor autonomous vehicles. Until recently, point decorating approaches, in which\npoint clouds are augmented with camera features, have been the dominant\napproach in the field. However, these approaches fail to utilize the higher\nresolution images from cameras. Recent works projecting camera features to the\nbird's-eye-view (BEV) space for fusion have also been proposed, however they\nrequire projecting millions of pixels, most of which only contain background\ninformation. In this work, we propose a novel approach Center Feature Fusion\n(CFF), in which we leverage center-based detection networks in both the camera\nand LiDAR streams to identify relevant object locations. We then use the\ncenter-based detection to identify the locations of pixel features relevant to\nobject locations, a small fraction of the total number in the image. These are\nthen projected and fused in the BEV frame. On the nuScenes dataset, we\noutperform the LiDAR-only baseline by 4.9% mAP while fusing up to 100x fewer\nfeatures than other fusion methods.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider a discrete-time multi-agent system involving $N$\ncost-coupled networked rational agents solving a consensus problem and a\ncentral Base Station (BS), scheduling agent communications over a network. Due\nto a hard bandwidth constraint on the number of transmissions through the\nnetwork, at most $R_d < N$ agents can concurrently access their state\ninformation through the network. Under standard assumptions on the information\nstructure of the agents and the BS, we first show that the control actions of\nthe agents are free of any dual effect, allowing for separation between\nestimation and control problems at each agent. Next, we propose a weighted age\nof information (WAoI) metric for the scheduling problem of the BS, where the\nweights depend on the estimation error of the agents. The BS aims to find the\noptimum scheduling policy that minimizes the WAoI, subject to the hard\nbandwidth constraint. Since this problem is NP hard, we first relax the hard\nconstraint to a soft update rate constraint, and then compute an optimal policy\nfor the relaxed problem by reformulating it into a Markov Decision Process\n(MDP). This then inspires a sub-optimal policy for the bandwidth constrained\nproblem, which is shown to approach the optimal policy as $N \\rightarrow\n\\infty$. Next, we solve the consensus problem using the mean-field game\nframework wherein we first design decentralized control policies for a limiting\ncase of the $N$-agent system (as $N \\rightarrow \\infty$). By explicitly\nconstructing the mean-field system, we prove the existence and uniqueness of\nthe mean-field equilibrium. Consequently, we show that the obtained equilibrium\npolicies constitute an $\\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium for the finite agent system.\nFinally, we validate the performance of both the scheduling and the control\npolicies through numerical simulations.",

Beyond timbre transfer, achieving\ncontrollability on para-linguistic parameters such as pitch and rhythm is\ncritical in deploying VC systems in many application scenarios.

In this paper, we propose ControlVC, the\nfirst neural voice conversion system that achieves time-varying controls on\npitch and rhythm. ControlVC uses pre-trained encoders to compute pitch\nembeddings and linguistic embeddings from the source utterance and speaker\nembeddings from the target utterance. These embeddings are then concatenated\nand converted to speech using a vocoder. It achieves rhythm control through\nTD-PSOLA pre-processing on the source utterance, and achieves pitch control by\nmanipulating the pitch contour before feeding it to the pitch encoder.\nSystematic subjective and objective evaluations are conducted to assess the\nspeech quality and controllability. Results show that, on non-parallel and\nzero-shot conversion tasks, ControlVC significantly outperforms two other\nself-constructed baselines on speech quality, and it can successfully achieve\ntime-varying pitch control.",

In\nother words, even though increasing $K$ decreases the standard deviation of the\ngradients, it also reduces the magnitude of the true gradient faster, thereby\nincreasing the relative variance of the gradient updates. Extensive experiments\nare performed to understand the importance of $K$. These experiments suggest\nthat tighter variational bounds are beneficial for the generative network,\nwhereas looser bounds are preferable for the inference network. With these\ninsights, three methods are implemented and studied: the partially importance\nweighted autoencoder (PIWAE), the multiply importance weighted autoencoder\n(MIWAE) and the combination importance weighted autoencoder (CIWAE). Each of\nthese three methods entails IWAE as a special case but employs the importance\nweights in different ways to ensure a higher SNR of the gradient estimators. In\nour research study and analysis, the efficacy of these algorithms is tested on\nmultiple datasets such as MNIST and Omniglot. Finally, we demonstrate that the\nthree presented IWAE variations are able to generate approximate posterior\ndistributions that are much closer to the true posterior distribution than for\nthe IWAE, while matching the performance of the IWAE generative network or\npotentially outperforming it in the case of PIWAE.",

EEG artifact removal is crucial in neuroscience\nbecause artifacts have a significant impact on the results of EEG analysis. The\nremoval of ocular artifacts is the most challenging among these artifacts. In\nthis study, a novel ocular artifact removal method is presented by developing\nbidirectional long-short term memory (BiLSTM)-based deep learning (DL) models.\nWe created a benchmarking dataset to train and test proposed DL models by\ncombining the EEGdenoiseNet and DEAP datasets. We also augmented the data by\ncontaminating ground-truth clean EEG signals with EOG at various SNR levels.\nThe BiLSTM network is then fed to features extracted from augmented signals\nusing highly-localized time-frequency (TF) coefficients obtained by wavelet\nsynchrosqueezed transform (WSST). We also compare the WSST-based DL model\nresults with traditional TF analysis (TFA) methods namely short-time Fourier\ntransformation (STFT) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) as well as\naugmented raw signals. The best average MSE value of 0.3066 was obtained by the\nfirst time-proposed BiLSTM-based WSST-Net model. Our results demonstrated the\nWSST-Net model significantly improves artifact removal performance compared to\ntraditional TF and raw signal methods.

A representative\nhyperspectral image acquisition procedure conducts a 3D-to-2D encoding by the\ncoded aperture snapshot spectral imager (CASSI), and requires a software\ndecoder for the 3D signal reconstruction. Based on this encoding procedure, two\nmajor challenges stand in the way of a high-fidelity reconstruction: (i) To\nobtain 2D measurements, CASSI dislocates multiple channels by disperser-titling\nand squeezes them onto the same spatial region, yielding an entangled data\nloss. (ii) The physical coded aperture (mask) will lead to a masked data loss\nby selectively blocking the pixel-wise light exposure. To tackle these\nchallenges, we propose a spatial-spectral (S2-) transformer architecture with a\nmask-aware learning strategy. Firstly, we simultaneously leverage spatial and\nspectral attention modelings to disentangle the blended information in the 2D\nmeasurement along both two dimensions. A series of Transformer structures\nacross spatial & spectral clues are systematically designed, which considers\nthe information inter-dependency between the two-fold cues. Secondly, the\nmasked pixels will induce higher prediction difficulty and should be treated\ndifferently from unmasked ones. Thereby, we adaptively prioritize the loss\npenalty attributing to the mask structure by inferring the difficulty-level\nupon the mask-aware prediction.

Comput., 2003) in investigating the\nquery complexity of finding a king, that is, the number of arcs in $\\vec T$ one\nhas to know in order to surely identify at least one vertex as a king.\nThe aforementioned authors showed that one always has to query at least\n$\\Omega(n^{4/3})$ arcs and provided a strategy that queries at most\n$O(n^{3/2})$. While this upper bound has not yet been improved for the original\nproblem,\nBiswas et al. (Frontiers in Algorithmics, 2017) proved that with $O(n^{4/3})$\nqueries one can identify a semi-king, meaning a vertex which controls at least\nhalf of all vertices.\nOur contribution is a novel strategy which improves upon the number of\ncontrolled vertices: using $O(n^{4/3} \\operatorname{polylog} n)$ queries, we\ncan identify a $(\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{2}{17})$-king.\nTo achieve this goal we use a novel structural result for tournaments.",

Digitally acquired data can accurately capture\ncomplex human activity, but it lacks the interpretability of demographic data.\nIn this paper, we study a privacy-enhanced dataset of the mobility visitation\npatterns of 1.2 million people to 1.1 million places in 11 metro areas in the\nU.S. to detect the latent mobility behaviors and lifestyles in the largest\nAmerican cities. Despite the considerable complexity of mobility visitations,\nwe found that lifestyles can be automatically decomposed into only 12 latent\ninterpretable activity behaviors on how people combine shopping, eating,\nworking, or using their free time. Rather than describing individuals with a\nsingle lifestyle, we find that city dwellers' behavior is a mixture of those\nbehaviors. Those detected latent activity behaviors are equally present across\ncities and cannot be fully explained by main demographic features. Finally, we\nfind those latent behaviors are associated with dynamics like experienced\nincome segregation, transportation, or healthy behaviors in cities, even after\ncontrolling for demographic features.

    "abstract": "The sixth generation networks envision the deployment of terahertz (THz) band\nas one of the key enabling property thanks to its abundant bandwidth. However,\nthe ultra-wide bandwidth in THz causes \\textit{beam-split} phenomenon due to\nthe use of a single analog beamformer (AB). Specifically, beam-split makes\ndifferent subcarriers to observe distinct directions since the same AB is\nadopted for all subcarriers. Previous works mostly employ additional hardware\ncomponents, e.g., time-delayer networks to mitigate beam-split by realizing\nvirtual subcarrier-dependent ABs. This paper introduces an efficient and\nunified approach, called beam-split-aware (BSA) hybrid beamforming. In\nparticular, instead of virtually generating subcarrier-dependent ABs, a single\nAB is used and the effect of beam-split is computed and passed into the digital\nbeamformers, which are subcarrier-dependent while maximizing spectral\nefficiency. Hence, the proposed BSA approach effectively mitigates the impact\nof beam-split and it can be applied to any hybrid beamforming scheme, two of\nwhich based on manifold optimization and orthogonal matching pursuit are\nconsidered for evaluation in multi-user scenario. Numerical simulations show\nthat significant performance improvement can be achieved as compared to the\nconventional techniques.",

    "abstract": "MRI and CT are most widely used medical imaging modalities. It is often\nnecessary to acquire multi-modality images for diagnosis and treatment such as\nradiotherapy planning. However, multi-modality imaging is not only costly but\nalso introduces misalignment between MRI and CT images. To address this\nchallenge, computational conversion is a viable approach between MRI and CT\nimages, especially from MRI to CT images. In this paper, we propose to use an\nemerging deep learning framework called diffusion and score-matching models in\nthis context. Specifically, we adapt denoising diffusion probabilistic and\nscore-matching models, use four different sampling strategies, and compare\ntheir performance metrics with that using a convolutional neural network and a\ngenerative adversarial network model. Our results show that the diffusion and\nscore-matching models generate better synthetic CT images than the CNN and GAN\nmodels. Furthermore, we investigate the uncertainties associated with the\ndiffusion and score-matching networks using the Monte-Carlo method, and improve\nthe results by averaging their Monte-Carlo outputs. Our study suggests that\ndiffusion and score-matching models are powerful to generate high quality\nimages conditioned on an image obtained using a complementary imaging modality,\nanalytically rigorous with clear explainability, and highly competitive with\nCNNs and GANs for image synthesis.",

A\ncontrol framework which can describe realism well expressed as the game based\ncontrol system (GBCS), was obtained in 2019, which, unfortunately, is not graph\ntheoretically verifiable, and the regulator control input is assumed to be\nzero. However, based on a new established notion, strategy matrix, we propose a\ngraph theory condition to judge the controllability of GBCS, instead of using\nalgebraic conditions for complex mathematical calculations. More specifically,\nto tackle these issues, one needs to study the expression of Nash equilibrium\nactions when regulators control is not zero first. Based on this expression,\nthe general formula of game controllability matrix is obtained, which provides\ntheoretical support for studying the essential influence of topology on game\nbased control system. The general formula is always affected by the specific\nmatrix strategy matrix, composed of Nash equilibrium actions, and the matrix\ncan not only be obtained by matrix calculation, but also can be directly\nwritten through the topology, which is the specific influence of the topology\non the GBCS. Finally, we obtain the result of judging the controllability of\nthe system directly according to the topological structure, and put forward the\nconjecture that there is no limitation of equivalent partition in GBCS.\nArguably, this is a surprising conjecture on the equivalent partition of\ngraphs, because only the limitation of equivalent partition in fivenode graphs\nhas been solved so far",

    "abstract": "Noise in seismic data arises from numerous sources and is continually\nevolving. The use of supervised deep learning procedures for denoising of\nseismic datasets often results in poor performance: this is due to the lack of\nnoise-free field data to act as training targets and the large difference in\ncharacteristics between synthetic and field datasets. Self-supervised,\nblind-spot networks typically overcome these limitation by training directly on\nthe raw, noisy data. However, such networks often rely on a random noise\nassumption, and their denoising capabilities quickly decrease in the presence\nof even minimally-correlated noise. Extending from blind-spots to blind-masks\ncan efficiently suppress coherent noise along a specific direction, but it\ncannot adapt to the ever-changing properties of noise. To preempt the network's\nability to predict the signal and reduce its opportunity to learn the noise\nproperties, we propose an initial, supervised training of the network on a\nfrugally-generated synthetic dataset prior to fine-tuning in a self-supervised\nmanner on the field dataset of interest. Considering the change in peak\nsignal-to-noise ratio, as well as the volume of noise reduced and signal\nleakage observed, we illustrate the clear benefit in initialising the\nself-supervised network with the weights from a supervised base-training. This\nis further supported by a test on a field dataset where the fine-tuned network\nstrikes the best balance between signal preservation and noise reduction.\nFinally, the use of the unrealistic, frugally-generated synthetic dataset for\nthe supervised base-training includes a number of benefits: minimal prior\ngeological knowledge is required, substantially reduced computational cost for\nthe dataset generation, and a reduced requirement of re-training the network\nshould recording conditions change, to name a few.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning methods have been shown to be effective for the automatic\nsegmentation of structures and pathologies in medical imaging. However, they\nrequire large annotated datasets, whose manual segmentation is a tedious and\ntime-consuming task, especially for large structures. We present a new method\nof partial annotations that uses a small set of consecutive annotated slices\nfrom each scan with an annotation effort that is equal to that of only few\nannotated cases. The training with partial annotations is performed by using\nonly annotated blocks, incorporating information about slices outside the\nstructure of interest and modifying a batch loss function to consider only the\nannotated slices. To facilitate training in a low data regime, we use a\ntwo-step optimization process. We tested the method with the popular soft Dice\nloss for the fetal body segmentation task in two MRI sequences, TRUFI and\nFIESTA, and compared full annotation regime to partial annotations with a\nsimilar annotation effort. For TRUFI data, the use of partial annotations\nyielded slightly better performance on average compared to full annotations\nwith an increase in Dice score from 0.936 to 0.942, and a substantial decrease\nin Standard Deviations (STD) of Dice score by 22% and Average Symmetric Surface\nDistance (ASSD) by 15%. For the FIESTA sequence, partial annotations also\nyielded a decrease in STD of the Dice score and ASSD metrics by 27.5% and 33%\nrespectively for in-distribution data, and a substantial improvement also in\naverage performance on out-of-distribution data, increasing Dice score from\n0.84 to 0.9 and decreasing ASSD from 7.46 to 4.01 mm.

The most popular\nexamples of iterative long-running quantum applications are variational quantum\nalgorithms (VQAs). Iteratively, VQA's classical optimizer evaluates circuit\ncandidates on an objective function and picks the best circuits towards\nachieving the application's target. Noise fluctuation can cause a significant\ntransient impact on the objective function estimation of the VQA iterations /\ntuning candidates. This can severely affect VQA tuning and, by extension, its\naccuracy and convergence.\nThis paper proposes QISMET: Quantum Iteration Skipping to Mitigate Error\nTransients, to navigate the dynamic noise landscape of VQAs. QISMET actively\navoids instances of high fluctuating noise which are predicted to have a\nsignificant transient error impact on specific VQA iterations. To achieve this,\nQISMET estimates transient error in VQA iterations and designs a controller to\nkeep the VQA tuning faithful to the transient-free scenario. By doing so,\nQISMET efficiently mitigates a large portion of the transient noise impact on\nVQAs and is able to improve the fidelity by 1.3x-3x over a traditional VQA\nbaseline, with 1.6-2.4x improvement over alternative approaches, across\ndifferent applications and machines. Further, to diligently analyze the effects\nof transients, this work also builds transient noise models for target VQA\napplications from observing real machine transients.

To this end,\none tries to find beforehand an optimal order in which the contractions should\nbe performed.

In\nthis study, a new convolutional neural architecture named RetiFluidNet is\nproposed for multi-class retinal fluid segmentation. The model benefits from\nhierarchical representation learning of textural, contextual, and edge features\nusing a new self-adaptive dual-attention (SDA) module, multiple self-adaptive\nattention-based skip connections (SASC), and a novel multi-scale deep self\nsupervision learning (DSL) scheme.

The model is validated based on three publicly\navailable datasets: RETOUCH, OPTIMA, and DUKE, with comparisons against several\nbaselines.

In practice, with a finite number of optimization steps and a\nlearning rate that cannot be annealed to zero, tail averaging can get much\ncloser to a local minimum point of the training loss than either the individual\niterates or the Polyak average. However, the number of leading iterates to\nignore is an important hyperparameter, and starting averaging too early or too\nlate leads to inefficient use of resources or suboptimal solutions. Setting\nthis hyperparameter to improve generalization is even more difficult,\nespecially in the presence of other hyperparameters and overfitting.\nFurthermore, before averaging starts, the loss is only weakly informative of\nthe final performance, which makes early stopping unreliable.

    "abstract": "Apparent parallels between natural language and biological sequence have led\nto a recent surge in the application of deep language models (LMs) to the\nanalysis of antibody and other biological sequences. However, a lack of a\nrigorous linguistic formalization of biological sequence languages, which would\ndefine basic components, such as lexicon (i.e., the discrete units of the\nlanguage) and grammar (i.e., the rules that link sequence well-formedness,\nstructure, and meaning) has led to largely domain-unspecific applications of\nLMs, which do not take into account the underlying structure of the biological\nsequences studied. A linguistic formalization, on the other hand, establishes\nlinguistically-informed and thus domain-adapted components for LM applications.\nIt would facilitate a better understanding of how differences and similarities\nbetween natural language and biological sequences influence the quality of LMs,\nwhich is crucial for the design of interpretable models with extractable\nsequence-functions relationship rules, such as the ones underlying the antibody\nspecificity prediction problem. Deciphering the rules of antibody specificity\nis crucial to accelerating rational and in silico biotherapeutic drug design.\nHere, we formalize the properties of the antibody language and thereby\nestablish not only a foundation for the application of linguistic tools in\nadaptive immune receptor analysis but also for the systematic immunolinguistic\nstudies of immune receptor specificity in general.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we consider the problem learning of variational models in the\ncontext of supervised learning via risk minimization. Our goal is to provide a\ndeeper understanding of the two approaches of learning of variational models\nvia bilevel optimization and via algorithm unrolling. The former considers the\nvariational model as a lower level optimization problem below the risk\nminimization problem, while the latter replaces the lower level optimization\nproblem by an algorithm that solves said problem approximately. Both approaches\nare used in practice, but, unrolling is much simpler from a computational point\nof view. To analyze and compare the two approaches, we consider a simple toy\nmodel, and compute all risks and the respective estimators explicitly. We show\nthat unrolling can be better than the bilevel optimization approach, but also\nthat the performance of unrolling can depend significantly on further\nparameters, sometimes in unexpected ways: While the stepsize of the unrolled\nalgorithm matters a lot, the number of unrolled iterations only matters if the\nnumber is even or odd, and these two cases are notably different.",

    "abstract": "It is common for data structures such as images and shapes of 2D objects to\nbe represented as points on a manifold. The utility of a mechanism to produce\nsanitized differentially private estimates from such data is intimately linked\nto how compatible it is with the underlying structure and geometry of the\nspace. In particular, as recently shown, utility of the Laplace mechanism on a\npositively curved manifold, such as Kendall's 2D shape space, is significantly\ninfluences by the curvature. Focusing on the problem of sanitizing the\nFr\\'echet mean of a sample of points on a manifold, we exploit the\ncharacterisation of the mean as the minimizer of an objective function\ncomprised of the sum of squared distances and develop a K-norm gradient\nmechanism on Riemannian manifolds that favors values that produce gradients\nclose to the the zero of the objective function. For the case of positively\ncurved manifolds, we describe how using the gradient of the squared distance\nfunction offers better control over sensitivity than the Laplace mechanism, and\ndemonstrate this numerically on a dataset of shapes of corpus callosa. Further\nillustrations of the mechanism's utility on a sphere and the manifold of\nsymmetric positive definite matrices are also presented.",

We start with a simple single-layer\nneural network (NN) but refrain from choosing the activation functions yet.\nUnder certain conditions and in the infinite-width limit, we may apply the\ncentral limit theorem, upon which the NN output becomes Gaussian. We may then\ninvestigate and manipulate the limit network by falling back on Gaussian\nprocess (GP) theory. It is observed that linear operators acting upon a GP\nagain yield a GP. This also holds true for differential operators defining\ndifferential equations and describing physical laws. If we demand the GP, or\nequivalently the limit network, to obey the physical law, then this yields an\nequation for the covariance function or kernel of the GP, whose solution\nequivalently constrains the model to obey the physical law. The central limit\ntheorem then suggests that NNs can be constructed to obey a physical law by\nchoosing the activation functions such that they match a particular kernel in\nthe infinite-width limit. The activation functions constructed in this way\nguarantee the NN to a priori obey the physics, up to the approximation error of\nnon-infinite network width. Simple examples of the homogeneous 1D-Helmholtz\nequation are discussed and compared to naive kernels and activations.",

It addresses how to recognize such announcements, the excess\nreturn of share buybacks, and the prediction of returns after a share buyback\nannouncement. We illustrate two NLP approaches for the automated detection of\nshare buyback announcements. Even with very small amounts of training data, we\ncan achieve an accuracy of up to 90%. This thesis utilizes these NLP methods to\ngenerate a large dataset consisting of 57,155 share buyback announcements. By\nanalyzing this dataset, this thesis aims to show that most companies, which\nhave a share buyback announced are underperforming the MSCI World. A minority\nof companies, however, significantly outperform the MSCI World. This\nsignificant overperformance leads to a net gain when looking at the averages of\nall companies. If the benchmark index is adjusted for the respective size of\nthe companies, the average overperformance disappears, and the majority\nunderperforms even greater. However, it was found that companies that announce\na share buyback with a volume of at least 1% of their market cap, deliver, on\naverage, a significant overperformance, even when using an adjusted benchmark.\nIt was also found that companies that announce share buybacks in times of\ncrisis emerge better than the overall market. Additionally, the generated\ndataset was used to train 72 machine learning models. Through this, it was able\nto find many strategies that could achieve an accuracy of up to 77% and\ngenerate great excess returns. A variety of performance indicators could be\nimproved across six different time frames and a significant overperformance was\nidentified. This was achieved by training several models for different tasks\nand time frames as well as combining these different models, generating\nsignificant improvement by fusing weak learners, in order to create one strong\nlearner.",
