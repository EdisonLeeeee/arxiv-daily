    "abstract": "Emergency Department (ED) overcrowding continues to be a public health issue\nas well as a patient safety issue. The underlying factors leading to ED\ncrowding are numerous, varied, and complex. Although lack of in-hospital beds\nis frequently attributed as the primary reason for crowding, ED's dependencies\non other ancillary resources, including imaging, consults, and labs, also\ncontribute to crowding. Using retrospective data associated with imaging,\nincluding delays, processing time, and the number of image orders, from a large\ntier 1 trauma center, we developed a discrete event simulation model to\nidentify the impact of the imaging delays and bundling image orders on patient\ntime in the ED. Results from sensitivity analysis show that reducing the delays\nassociated with imaging and bundling as few as 10% of imaging orders for\ncertain patients can significantly (p-value < 0.05) reduce the time a patient\nspends in the ED.",

    "abstract": "Increasing the layer number of on-chip photonic neural networks (PNNs) is\nessential to improve its model performance. However, the successively cascading\nof network hidden layers results in larger integrated photonic chip areas. To\naddress this issue, we propose the optical neural ordinary differential\nequations (ON-ODE) architecture that parameterizes the continuous dynamics of\nhidden layers with optical ODE solvers. The ON-ODE comprises the PNNs followed\nby the photonic integrator and optical feedback loop, which can be configured\nto represent residual neural networks (ResNet) and recurrent neural networks\nwith effectively reduced chip area occupancy. For the interference-based\noptoelectronic nonlinear hidden layer, the numerical experiments demonstrate\nthat the single hidden layer ON-ODE can achieve approximately the same accuracy\nas the two-layer optical ResNet in image classification tasks. Besides, the\nONODE improves the model classification accuracy for the diffraction-based\nall-optical linear hidden layer.

Numerous studies have\nshown that the track stiffness is one of the main parameters influencing the\nevolution of degradation that drives maintenance processes. As such, the\nmeasurement of track stiffness is fundamental for characterizing the\nperformance of the track in terms of deterioration rate and noise emission.\nThis can be achieved via low-cost On Board Monitoring (OBM) sensing systems\n(i.e., axle-box accelerometers) that are mounted on in-service trains and\nenable frequent, real-time monitoring of the railway infrastructure network.\nAcceleration-based stiffness indicators have seldom been considered in\nmonitoring applications. In this work, the use of a Vold-Kalman filter is\nproposed, for decomposing the signal into periodic wheel and track related\nexcitation--response pairs functions. We demonstrate that these components are\nin turn correlated to operational conditions, such as wheel out-of-roundness\nand rail type.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) speech models have achieved unprecedented\nsuccess in speech representation learning, but some questions regarding their\nrepresentation ability remain unanswered. This paper addresses two of them: (1)\nCan SSL speech models deal with non-speech audio?; (2) Would different SSL\nspeech models have insights into diverse aspects of audio features? To answer\nthe two questions, we conduct extensive experiments on abundant speech and\nnon-speech audio datasets to evaluate the representation ability of currently\nstate-of-the-art SSL speech models, which are wav2vec 2.0 and HuBERT in this\npaper. These experiments are carried out during NeurIPS 2021 HEAR Challenge as\na standard evaluation pipeline provided by competition officials. Results show\nthat (1) SSL speech models could extract meaningful features of a wide range of\nnon-speech audio, while they may also fail on certain types of datasets; (2)\ndifferent SSL speech models have insights into different aspects of audio\nfeatures. The two conclusions provide a foundation for the ensemble of\nrepresentation models. We further propose an ensemble framework to fuse speech\nrepresentation models' embeddings.

A LA auction extracts at least 1/2 of the optimal\nrevenue, even under a correlated value distribution. This bound is tight, even\nfor 2 buyers with independent values. We introduce a natural extension of LA,\ncalled lookahead with pooling (LAP). A LAP auction proceeds as LA, with one\ndifference: it allows the seller to pool together a range of values during the\nascending-price stage, and treat them the same; thus, it preserves the\nsimplicity and fairness of LA. Our main result is that this simple pooling\noperation improves the revenue guarantees for independent buyers from 1/2 to\n4/7 of the optimal revenue.

One of the shortfalls of AI models in\ngeneral, and deep machine learning in particular, is a drop in performance when\nfaced with shifts in the distribution of data. Nonetheless, these shifts are\nalways expected in real-world applications; thus, a field of study has emerged,\nfocusing on detecting out-of-distribution data subsets and enabling a more\ncomprehensive generalization. Furthermore, as many deep learning based models\nhave achieved near-perfect results on benchmark datasets, the need to evaluate\nthese models' reliability and trustworthiness for pushing towards real-world\napplications is felt more strongly than ever. This has given rise to a growing\nnumber of studies in the field of out-of-distribution detection and domain\ngeneralization, which begs the need for surveys that compare these studies from\nvarious perspectives and highlight their straightens and weaknesses. This paper\npresents a survey that, in addition to reviewing more than 70 papers in this\nfield, presents challenges and directions for future works and offers a\nunifying look into various types of data shifts and solutions for better\ngeneralization.",

With the recent development of radar\ntechnologies and open-sourced annotated data sets, semantic segmentation with\nradar signals has become very promising. However, existing methods are either\ncomputationally expensive or discard significant amounts of valuable\ninformation from raw 3D radar signals by reducing them to 2D planes via\naveraging. In this work, we introduce ERASE-Net, an Efficient RAdar\nSEgmentation Network to segment the raw radar signals semantically. The core of\nour approach is the novel detect-then-segment method for raw radar signals. It\nfirst detects the center point of each object, then extracts a compact radar\nsignal representation, and finally performs semantic segmentation. We show that\nour method can achieve superior performance on radar semantic segmentation task\ncompared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) technique. Furthermore, our approach\nrequires up to 20x less computational resources. Finally, we show that the\nproposed ERASE-Net can be compressed by 40% without significant loss in\nperformance, significantly more than the SOTA network, which makes it a more\npromising candidate for practical automotive applications.",

    "abstract": "Learning to manipulate 3D objects in an interactive environment has been a\nchallenging problem in Reinforcement Learning (RL). In particular, it is hard\nto train a policy that can generalize over objects with different semantic\ncategories, diverse shape geometry and versatile functionality. Recently, the\ntechnique of visual affordance has shown great prospects in providing\nobject-centric information priors with effective actionable semantics. As such,\nan effective policy can be trained to open a door by knowing how to exert force\non the handle. However, to learn the affordance, it often requires\nhuman-defined action primitives, which limits the range of applicable tasks. In\nthis study, we take advantage of visual affordance by using the contact\ninformation generated during the RL training process to predict contact maps of\ninterest. Such contact prediction process then leads to an end-to-end\naffordance learning framework that can generalize over different types of\nmanipulation tasks. Surprisingly, the effectiveness of such framework holds\neven under the multi-stage and the multi-agent scenarios. We tested our method\non eight types of manipulation tasks. Results showed that our methods\noutperform baseline algorithms, including visual-based affordance methods and\nRL methods, by a large margin on the success rate.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a cross-lingual classification method for English,\nKorean, and Tamil, which employs both language-independent features and\nlanguage-unique features. First, we extract thirty-nine features from diverse\nspeech dimensions such as voice quality, pronunciation, and prosody. Second,\nfeature selections are applied to identify the optimal feature set for each\nlanguage. A set of shared features and a set of distinctive features are\ndistinguished by comparing the feature selection results of the three\nlanguages. Lastly, automatic severity classification is performed, utilizing\nthe two feature sets. Notably, the proposed method removes different features\nby languages to prevent the negative effect of unique features for other\nlanguages. Accordingly, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm is\nemployed for classification, due to its strength in imputing missing data. In\norder to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, two baseline\nexperiments are conducted: experiments using the intersection set of\nmono-lingual feature sets (Intersection) and experiments using the union set of\nmono-lingual feature sets (Union). According to the experimental results, our\nmethod achieves better performance with a 67.14% F1 score, compared to 64.52%\nfor the Intersection experiment and 66.74% for the Union experiment. Further,\nthe proposed method attains better performances than mono-lingual\nclassifications for all three languages, achieving 17.67%, 2.28%, 7.79%\nrelative percentage increases for English, Korean, and Tamil, respectively.

Aiming to improve DN operational efficiency, as\nquantified by a generic optimal reactive power flow (ORPF) problem, we propose\na two-stage approach. The first stage involves learning the manifold of optimal\noperating points determined by an ORPF instance. To synthesize local Volt/Var\ncontrollers, the learning task is partitioned into learning local surrogates\n(one per DER) of the optimal manifold with voltage input and reactive power\noutput. Since these surrogates characterize efficient DN operating points, in\nthe second stage, we develop local control schemes that steer the DN to these\noperating points. We identify the conditions on the surrogates and control\nparameters to ensure that the locally acting controllers collectively converge,\nin a global asymptotic sense, to a DN operating point agreeing with the local\nsurrogates. We use neural networks to model the surrogates and enforce the\nidentified conditions in the training phase.

The intricate channel model and variable-rate transmission strategy\nsignificantly complicate the performance analysis.

The outage probability and the long term average throughput\n(LTAT) are then derived in closed-form with clear insights. Furthermore, the\nsimplicity of the obtained expressions enables the maximization of the LTAT\ngiven an outage constraint through choosing appropriate transmission rates.\nParticularly, the increasing monotonicity and the convexity of outage\nprobability with respect to transmission rates allow us to solve the problem\nsuboptimally by combining together alternately iterating optimization and\nconcave fractional programming, and the proposed suboptimal algorithm has a\nlower computational complexity than the exhaustive search algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Most of today's computer vision pipelines are built around deep neural\nnetworks, where convolution operations require most of the generally high\ncompute effort. The Winograd convolution algorithm computes convolutions with\nfewer MACs compared to the standard algorithm, reducing the operation count by\na factor of 2.25x for 3x3 convolutions when using the version with 2x2-sized\ntiles $F_2$. Even though the gain is significant, the Winograd algorithm with\nlarger tile sizes, i.e., $F_4$, offers even more potential in improving\nthroughput and energy efficiency, as it reduces the required MACs by 4x.\nUnfortunately, the Winograd algorithm with larger tile sizes introduces\nnumerical issues that prevent its use on integer domain-specific accelerators\nand higher computational overhead to transform input and output data between\nspatial and Winograd domains.\nTo unlock the full potential of Winograd $F_4$, we propose a novel tap-wise\nquantization method that overcomes the numerical issues of using larger tiles,\nenabling integer-only inference. Moreover, we present custom hardware units\nthat process the Winograd transformations in a power- and area-efficient way,\nand we show how to integrate such custom modules in an industrial-grade,\nprogrammable DSA. An extensive experimental evaluation on a large set of\nstate-of-the-art computer vision benchmarks reveals that the tap-wise\nquantization algorithm makes the quantized Winograd $F_4$ network almost as\naccurate as the FP32 baseline. The Winograd-enhanced DSA achieves up to 1.85x\ngain in energy efficiency and up to 1.83x end-to-end speed-up for\nstate-of-the-art segmentation and detection networks.",

Our technique detects collisions\nin a hash function used in the said algorithm, based on sampling TCP source\nports generated in an attacker-prescribed manner. These hash collisions depend\nsolely on a per-device key, and thus the set of collisions forms a device ID\nthat allows tracking devices across browsers, browser privacy modes,\ncontainers, and IPv4/IPv6 networks (including some VPNs). It can distinguish\namong devices with identical hardware and software, and lasts until the device\nrestarts.\nWe implemented this technique and then tested it using tracking servers in\ntwo different locations and with Linux devices on various networks. We also\ntested it on an Android device that we patched to introduce the new port\nselection algorithm. The tracking technique works in real-life conditions, and\nwe report detailed findings about it, including its dwell time, scalability,\nand success rate in different network types.

    "abstract": "Remote sensing benefits habitat conservation by making monitoring of large\nareas easier compared to field surveying especially if the remote sensed data\ncan be automatically analyzed. An important aspect of monitoring is classifying\nand mapping habitat types present in the monitored area. Automatic\nclassification is a difficult task, as classes have fine-grained differences\nand their distributions are long-tailed and unbalanced. Usually training data\nused for automatic land cover classification relies on fully annotated\nsegmentation maps, annotated from remote sensed imagery to a fairly high-level\ntaxonomy, i.e., classes such as forest, farmland, or urban area. A challenge\nwith automatic habitat classification is that reliable data annotation requires\nfield-surveys. Therefore, full segmentation maps are expensive to produce, and\ntraining data is often sparse, point-like, and limited to areas accessible by\nfoot. Methods for utilizing these limited data more efficiently are needed.\nWe address these problems by proposing a method for habitat classification\nand mapping, and apply this method to classify the entire northern Finnish\nLapland area into Natura2000 classes. The method is characterized by using\nfinely-grained, sparse, single-pixel annotations collected from the field,\ncombined with large amounts of unannotated data to produce segmentation maps.\nSupervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised methods are compared, and the\nbenefits of transfer learning from a larger out-of-domain dataset are\ndemonstrated. We propose a \\ac{CNN} biased towards center pixel classification\nensembled with a random forest classifier, that produces higher quality\nclassifications than the models themselves alone. We show that cropping\naugmentations, test-time augmentation and semi-supervised learning can help\nclassification even further.",

    "abstract": "Traditional urban planning demands urban experts to spend considerable time\nand effort producing an optimal urban plan under many architectural\nconstraints. The remarkable imaginative ability of deep generative learning\nprovides hope for renovating urban planning. While automated urban planners\nhave been examined, they are constrained because of the following: 1)\nneglecting human requirements in urban planning; 2) omitting spatial\nhierarchies in urban planning, and 3) lacking numerous urban plan data samples.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose a novel, deep, human-instructed urban\nplanner. In the preliminary work, we formulate it into an encoder-decoder\nparadigm. The encoder is to learn the information distribution of surrounding\ncontexts, human instructions, and land-use configuration. The decoder is to\nreconstruct the land-use configuration and the associated urban functional\nzones. The reconstruction procedure will capture the spatial hierarchies\nbetween functional zones and spatial grids. Meanwhile, we introduce a\nvariational Gaussian mechanism to mitigate the data sparsity issue. Even though\nearly work has led to good results, the performance of generation is still\nunstable because the way spatial hierarchies are captured may lead to unclear\noptimization directions. In this journal version, we propose a cascading deep\ngenerative framework based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) to solve\nthis problem, inspired by the workflow of urban experts. In particular, the\npurpose of the first GAN is to build urban functional zones based on\ninformation from human instructions and surrounding contexts. The second GAN\nwill produce the land-use configuration based on the functional zones that have\nbeen constructed. Additionally, we provide a conditioning augmentation module\nto augment data samples. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to validate\nthe efficacy of our work.",

    "abstract": "Cellular networks (LTE, 5G, and beyond) are dramatically growing with high\ndemand from consumers and more promising than the other wireless networks with\nadvanced telecommunication technologies. The main goal of these networks is to\nconnect billions of devices, systems, and users with high-speed data\ntransmission, high cell capacity, and low latency, as well as to support a wide\nrange of new applications, such as virtual reality, metaverse, telehealth,\nonline education, autonomous and flying vehicles, advanced manufacturing, and\nmany more. To achieve these goals, spectrum sensing has been paid more\nattention, along with new approaches using artificial intelligence (AI) methods\nfor spectrum management in cellular networks. This paper provides a\nvulnerability analysis of spectrum sensing approaches using AI-based semantic\nsegmentation models for identifying cellular network signals under adversarial\nattacks with and without defensive distillation methods. The results showed\nthat mitigation methods can significantly reduce the vulnerabilities of\nAI-based spectrum sensing models against adversarial attacks.",

    "abstract": "Performance metrics for medical image segmentation models are used to measure\nagreement between the reference annotation and the prediction. A common set of\nmetrics is used in the development of such models to make results more\ncomparable. However, there is a mismatch between the distributions in public\ndata sets and cases encountered in clinical practice. Many common metrics fail\nto measure the impact of this mismatch, especially for clinical data sets\ncontaining uncertain, small or empty reference annotation. Thus, models may not\nbe validated for clinically meaningful agreement by such metrics. Dimensions of\nevaluating clinical value include independence from reference annotation volume\nsize, consideration of uncertainty of reference annotations, reward of\nvolumetric and/or location agreement and reward of correct classification of\nempty reference annotations. Unlike common public data sets, our in-house data\nset is more representative. It contains uncertain, small or empty reference\nannotations. We examine publicly available metrics on the predictions of a deep\nlearning framework in order to identify for which settings common metrics\nprovide clinical meaningful results. We compare to a public benchmark data set\nwithout uncertain, small or empty reference annotations. The code will be\npublished.",

    "abstract": "In the era of joint ventures (JV) and mergers & acquisitions (M&A), dynamic\nand large business processes can emerge to achieve broader business goals and\nare often formed from business processes of distinct organizations. Software\nsystems of such distinct organizations should support these larger processes\nand, for this, they need to communicate among them forming the so called\nSystems-of-Systems (SoS). However, the management of these larger processes and\nthe correspondent SoS has been currently a complicated challenge for the\nalliances of organizations. In this scenario, the main contribution of this\npaper is to discover what has been proposed in the literature to manage these\nprocesses. We analyzed possibly all existing approaches and the findings point\nout that many of them cannot provide understanding of the whole large processes\nand, more importantly, they do not address completely the SoS inherent\ncharacteristics.

ML-based decision systems, however, are found to be prone to bias\nwhich result in yet unfair decisions. Several notions of fairness have been\ndefined in the literature to capture the different subtleties of this ethical\nand social concept (e.g. statistical parity, equal opportunity, etc.). Fairness\nrequirements to be satisfied while learning models created several types of\ntensions among the different notions of fairness, but also with other desirable\nproperties such as privacy and classification accuracy. This paper surveys the\ncommonly used fairness notions and discusses the tensions that exist among them\nand with privacy and accuracy.

    "abstract": "Understanding the evolution of complexity is an important topic in a wide\nvariety of academic fields. Implications of better understanding complexity\ninclude increased knowledge of major evolutionary transitions and the\nproperties of living and technological systems. Genotype-phenotype (G-P) maps\nare fundamental to evolution, and biologically-oriented G-P maps have been\nshown to have interesting and often-universal properties that enable evolution\nby following phenotype-preserving walks in genotype space. Here we use a\ndigital logic gate circuit G-P map where genotypes are represented by circuits\nand phenotypes by the functions that the circuits compute. We compare two\nmathematical definitions of circuit and phenotype complexity and show how these\ndefinitions relate to other well-known properties of evolution such as\nredundancy, robustness, and evolvability. Using both Cartesian and Linear\ngenetic programming implementations, we demonstrate that the logic gate circuit\nshares many universal properties of biologically derived G-P maps, with the\nexception of the relationship between one method of computing phenotypic\nevolvability, robustness, and complexity. Due to the inherent structure of the\nG-P map, including the predominance of rare phenotypes, large interconnected\nneutral networks, and the high mutational load of low robustness, complex\nphenotypes are difficult to discover using evolution. We suggest, based on this\nevidence, that evolving complexity is hard and we discuss computational\nstrategies for genetic-programming-based evolution to successfully find\ngenotypes that map to complex phenotypes in the search space.",

    "abstract": "Social media has become the fulcrum of all forms of communication.\nClassifying social texts such as fake news, rumour, sarcasm, etc. has gained\nsignificant attention. The surface-level signals expressed by a social-text\nitself may not be adequate for such tasks; therefore, recent methods attempted\nto incorporate other intrinsic signals such as user behavior and the underlying\ngraph structure. Oftentimes, the `public wisdom' expressed through the\ncomments/replies to a social-text acts as a surrogate of crowd-sourced view and\nmay provide us with complementary signals. State-of-the-art methods on\nsocial-text classification tend to ignore such a rich hierarchical signal.\nHere, we propose Hyphen, a discourse-aware hyperbolic spectral co-attention\nnetwork. Hyphen is a fusion of hyperbolic graph representation learning with a\nnovel Fourier co-attention mechanism in an attempt to generalise the\nsocial-text classification tasks by incorporating public discourse. We parse\npublic discourse as an Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graph and use the\npowerful hyperbolic geometric representation to model graphs with hierarchical\nstructure. Finally, we equip it with a novel Fourier co-attention mechanism to\ncapture the correlation between the source post and public discourse. Extensive\nexperiments on four different social-text classification tasks, namely\ndetecting fake news, hate speech, rumour, and sarcasm, show that Hyphen\ngeneralises well, and achieves state-of-the-art results on ten benchmark\ndatasets.

    "abstract": "As recommender systems become increasingly central for sorting and\nprioritizing the content available online, they have a growing impact on the\nopportunities or revenue of their items producers. For instance, they influence\nwhich recruiter a resume is recommended to, or to whom and how much a music\ntrack, video or news article is being exposed. This calls for recommendation\napproaches that not only maximize (a proxy of) user satisfaction, but also\nconsider some notion of fairness in the exposure of items or groups of items.\nFormally, such recommendations are usually obtained by maximizing a concave\nobjective function in the space of randomized rankings. When the total exposure\nof an item is defined as the sum of its exposure over users, the optimal\nrankings of every users become coupled, which makes the optimization process\nchallenging. Existing approaches to find these rankings either solve the global\noptimization problem in a batch setting, i.e., for all users at once, which\nmakes them inapplicable at scale, or are based on heuristics that have weak\ntheoretical guarantees. In this paper, we propose the first efficient online\nalgorithm to optimize concave objective functions in the space of rankings\nwhich applies to every concave and smooth objective function, such as the ones\nfound for fairness of exposure. Based on online variants of the Frank-Wolfe\nalgorithm, we show that our algorithm is computationally fast, generating\nrankings on-the-fly with computation cost dominated by the sort operation,\nmemory efficient, and has strong theoretical guarantees. Compared to baseline\npolicies that only maximize user-side performance, our algorithm allows to\nincorporate complex fairness of exposure criteria in the recommendations with\nnegligible computational overhead.",

    "abstract": "Given a set $P$ of points in the plane, a point burning process is a discrete\ntime process to burn all the points of $P$ where fires must be initiated at the\ngiven points. Specifically, the point burning process starts with a single\nburnt point from $P$, and at each subsequent step, burns all the points in the\nplane that are within one unit distance from the currently burnt points, as\nwell as one other unburnt point of $P$ (if exists). The point burning number of\n$P$ is the smallest number of steps required to burn all the points of $P$. If\nwe allow the fire to be initiated anywhere, then the burning process is called\nan anywhere burning process, and the corresponding burning number is called\nanywhere burning number. Computing the point and anywhere burning number is\nknown to be NP-hard. In this paper we show that both these problems admit PTAS\nin one dimension. We then show that in two dimensions, point burning and\nanywhere burning are $(1.96296+\\varepsilon)$ and $(1.92188+\\varepsilon)$\napproximable, respectively, for every $\\varepsilon>0$, which improves the\npreviously known $(2+\\varepsilon)$ factor for these problems. We also observe\nthat a known result on set cover problem can be leveraged to obtain a\n2-approximation for burning the maximum number of points in a given number of\nsteps.

Recent methods\nutilize strong 3D networks to extract geometric grasping representations from\ndepth sensors, demonstrating superior accuracy on common objects but perform\nunsatisfactorily on photometrically challenging objects, e.g., objects in\ntransparent or reflective materials. The bottleneck lies in that the surface of\nthese objects can not reflect back accurate depth due to the absorption or\nrefraction of light. In this paper, in contrast to exploiting the inaccurate\ndepth data, we propose the first RGB-only 6-DoF grasping pipeline called\nMonoGraspNet that utilizes stable 2D features to simultaneously handle\narbitrary object grasping and overcome the problems induced by photometrically\nchallenging objects. MonoGraspNet leverages keypoint heatmap and normal map to\nrecover the 6-DoF grasping poses represented by our novel representation\nparameterized with 2D keypoints with corresponding depth, grasping direction,\ngrasping width, and angle. Extensive experiments in real scenes demonstrate\nthat our method can achieve competitive results in grasping common objects and\nsurpass the depth-based competitor by a large margin in grasping\nphotometrically challenging objects.

However, unlike multi-rotors, airships are severely\nmotion constrained and affected by ambient wind. Their orientation and flight\ndirection are also tightly coupled. Therefore, state-of-the-art MPC-based\nformation control methods for perception tasks are not directly applicable for\na team of airships. In this paper, we address this problem by first exploiting\na periodic relationship between the airspeed of an airship and its distance to\nthe subject.

    "title": "Efficient Concurrent Design of the Morphology of Unmanned Aerial Systems  and their Collective-Search Behavior",
    "abstract": "The collective operation of robots, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)\noperating as a team or swarm, is affected by their individual capabilities,\nwhich in turn is dependent on their physical design, aka morphology. However,\nwith the exception of a few (albeit ad hoc) evolutionary robotics methods,\nthere has been very little work on understanding the interplay of morphology\nand collective behavior. There is especially a lack of computational frameworks\nto concurrently search for the robot morphology and the hyper-parameters of\ntheir behavior model that jointly optimize the collective (team) performance.\nTo address this gap, this paper proposes a new co-design framework. Here the\nexploding computational cost of an otherwise nested morphology/behavior\nco-design is effectively alleviated through the novel concept of ``talent\"\nmetrics; while also allowing significantly better solutions compared to the\ntypically sub-optimal sequential morphology$\\to$behavior design approach. This\nframework comprises four major steps: talent metrics selection, talent Pareto\nexploration (a multi-objective morphology optimization process), behavior\noptimization, and morphology finalization. This co-design concept is\ndemonstrated by applying it to design UAVs that operate as a team to localize\nsignal sources, e.g., in victim search and hazard localization. Here, the\ncollective behavior is driven by a recently reported batch Bayesian search\nalgorithm called Bayes-Swarm. Our case studies show that the outcome of\nco-design provides significantly higher success rates in signal source\nlocalization compared to a baseline design, across a variety of signal\nenvironments and teams with 6 to 15 UAVs. Moreover, this co-design process\nprovides two orders of magnitude reduction in computing time compared to a\nprojected nested design approach.",

    "abstract": "Humans make extensive use of vision and touch as complementary senses, with\nvision providing global information about the scene and touch measuring local\ninformation during manipulation without suffering from occlusions. In this\nwork, we propose a novel framework for learning multi-task visuo-tactile\nrepresentations in a self-supervised manner. We design a mechanism which\nenables a robot to autonomously collect spatially aligned visual and tactile\ndata, a key property for downstream tasks. We then train visual and tactile\nencoders to embed these paired sensory inputs into a shared latent space using\ncross-modal contrastive loss. The learned representations are evaluated without\nfine-tuning on 5 perception and control tasks involving deformable surfaces:\ntactile classification, contact localization, anomaly detection (e.g., surgical\nphantom tumor palpation), tactile search from a visual query (e.g., garment\nfeature localization under occlusion), and tactile servoing along cloth edges\nand cables. The learned representations achieve an 80% success rate on towel\nfeature classification, a 73% average success rate on anomaly detection in\nsurgical materials, a 100% average success rate on vision-guided tactile\nsearch, and 87.8% average servo distance along cables and garment seams. These\nresults suggest the flexibility of the learned representations and pose a step\ntoward task-agnostic visuo-tactile representation learning for robot control.",

The main aim of the system is to derive a set of parameters the child's\ncurrent level of cognitive and behavioral performance (e.g., engagement,\nattention, task accuracy) from the available sensors and classifiers (e.g., eye\ntrackers, motion sensors, emotion recognition techniques) and take decisions\naccordingly.

    "abstract": "Hindsight goal relabeling has become a foundational technique for multi-goal\nreinforcement learning (RL). The idea is quite simple: any arbitrary trajectory\ncan be seen as an expert demonstration for reaching the trajectory's end state.\nIntuitively, this procedure trains a goal-conditioned policy to imitate a\nsub-optimal expert. However, this connection between imitation and hindsight\nrelabeling is not well understood. Modern imitation learning algorithms are\ndescribed in the language of divergence minimization, and yet it remains an\nopen problem how to recast hindsight goal relabeling into that framework. In\nthis work, we develop a unified objective for goal-reaching that explains such\na connection, from which we can derive goal-conditioned supervised learning\n(GCSL) and the reward function in hindsight experience replay (HER) from first\nprinciples. Experimentally, we find that despite recent advances in\ngoal-conditioned behaviour cloning (BC), multi-goal Q-learning can still\noutperform BC-like methods; moreover, a vanilla combination of both actually\nhurts model performance. Under our framework, we study when BC is expected to\nhelp, and empirically validate our findings.

    "abstract": "Control design for robotic systems is complex and often requires solving an\noptimization to follow a trajectory accurately. Online optimization approaches\nlike Model Predictive Control (MPC) have been shown to achieve great tracking\nperformance, but require high computing power. Conversely, learning-based\noffline optimization approaches, such as Reinforcement Learning (RL), allow\nfast and efficient execution on the robot but hardly match the accuracy of MPC\nin trajectory tracking tasks. In systems with limited compute, such as aerial\nvehicles, an accurate controller that is efficient at execution time is\nimperative. We propose an Analytic Policy Gradient (APG) method to tackle this\nproblem. APG exploits the availability of differentiable simulators by training\na controller offline with gradient descent on the tracking error. We address\ntraining instabilities that frequently occur with APG through curriculum\nlearning and experiment on a widely used controls benchmark, the CartPole, and\ntwo common aerial robots, a quadrotor and a fixed-wing drone. Our proposed\nmethod outperforms both model-based and model-free RL methods in terms of\ntracking error. Concurrently, it achieves similar performance to MPC while\nrequiring more than an order of magnitude less computation time.

We show\nthat both approaches, each in a different way, eliminate infeasible cases due\nto time-driven inter-sampling effects, thus also eliminating the need for\nselecting the size of time steps.

There is a growing interest in applying artificial\nintelligence (AI) to this area of healthcare by addressing known limitations\nand challenges such as predicting and classifying vital signs and physical\nmovements, which are considered crucial tasks. Federated learning is a\nrelatively new AI technique designed to enhance data privacy by decentralizing\ntraditional machine learning modeling. However, traditional federated learning\nrequires identical architectural models to be trained across the local clients\nand global servers. This limits global model architecture due to the lack of\nlocal models heterogeneity. To overcome this, a novel federated learning\narchitecture, FedStack, which supports ensembling heterogeneous architectural\nclient models was proposed in this study. This work offers a protected privacy\nsystem for hospitalized in-patients in a decentralized approach and identifies\noptimum sensor placement. The proposed architecture was applied to a mobile\nhealth sensor benchmark dataset from 10 different subjects to classify 12\nroutine activities. Three AI models, ANN, CNN, and Bi-LSTM were trained on\nindividual subject data. The federated learning architecture was applied to\nthese models to build local and global models capable of state of the art\nperformances. The local CNN model outperformed ANN and Bi-LSTM models on each\nsubject data.

    "title": "Defining and Characterizing Reward Hacking",
    "abstract": "We provide the first formal definition of reward hacking, a phenomenon where\noptimizing an imperfect proxy reward function, $\\mathcal{\\tilde{R}}$, leads to\npoor performance according to the true reward function, $\\mathcal{R}$. We say\nthat a proxy is unhackable if increasing the expected proxy return can never\ndecrease the expected true return. Intuitively, it might be possible to create\nan unhackable proxy by leaving some terms out of the reward function (making it\n\"narrower\") or overlooking fine-grained distinctions between roughly equivalent\noutcomes, but we show this is usually not the case. A key insight is that the\nlinearity of reward (in state-action visit counts) makes unhackability a very\nstrong condition. In particular, for the set of all stochastic policies, two\nreward functions can only be unhackable if one of them is constant. We thus\nturn our attention to deterministic policies and finite sets of stochastic\npolicies, where non-trivial unhackable pairs always exist, and establish\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of simplifications, an\nimportant special case of unhackability. Our results reveal a tension between\nusing reward functions to specify narrow tasks and aligning AI systems with\nhuman values.",

As opposed to the existing works where the energy harvested by\nInternet of things (IoT) devices only come from the power station, IoT devices\nare also allowed to recycle energy from other IoT devices. In particular, we\npropose group switching- and user switching-based protocols with time-division\nmultiple access to evaluate the impact of energy recycling on system\nperformance. Two different optimization problems are respectively formulated\nfor maximizing the sum throughput by jointly optimizing the energy beamforming\nvectors, the transmit power, the transmission time, the receive beamforming\nvectors, the grouping factors, and the phase-shift matrices, where the\nconstraints of the minimum throughput, the harvested energy, the maximum\ntransmit power, the phase shift, the grouping, and the time allocation are\ntaken into account. In light of the intractability of the above problems, we\nrespectively develop two alternating optimization-based iterative algorithms by\ncombining the successive convex approximation method and the penalty-based\nmethod to obtain corresponding sub-optimal solutions. Simulation results verify\nthat the energy recycling-based mechanism can assist in enhancing the\nperformance of IoT devices in terms of energy harvesting and information\ntransmission.

In this paper, we introduce WikiDes, a\nnovel dataset to generate short descriptions of Wikipedia articles for the\nproblem of text summarization. The dataset consists of over 80k English samples\non 6987 topics. We set up a two-phase summarization method - description\ngeneration (Phase I) and candidate ranking (Phase II) - as a strong approach\nthat relies on transfer and contrastive learning. For description generation,\nT5 and BART show their superiority compared to other small-scale pre-trained\nmodels. By applying contrastive learning with the diverse input from beam\nsearch, the metric fusion-based ranking models outperform the direct\ndescription generation models significantly up to 22 ROUGE in topic-exclusive\nsplit and topic-independent split. Furthermore, the outcome descriptions in\nPhase II are supported by human evaluation in over 45.33% chosen compared to\n23.66% in Phase I against the gold descriptions. In the aspect of sentiment\nanalysis, the generated descriptions cannot effectively capture all sentiment\npolarities from paragraphs while doing this task better from the gold\ndescriptions. The automatic generation of new descriptions reduces the human\nefforts in creating them and enriches Wikidata-based knowledge graphs. Our\npaper shows a practical impact on Wikipedia and Wikidata since there are\nthousands of missing descriptions.

    "abstract": "Accurate traffic forecasting is vital to an intelligent transportation\nsystem. Although many deep learning models have achieved state-of-art\nperformance for short-term traffic forecasting of up to 1 hour, long-term\ntraffic forecasting that spans multiple hours remains a major challenge.\nMoreover, most of the existing deep learning traffic forecasting models are\nblack box, presenting additional challenges related to explainability and\ninterpretability. We develop Graph Pyramid Autoformer (X-GPA), an explainable\nattention-based spatial-temporal graph neural network that uses a novel pyramid\nautocorrelation attention mechanism. It enables learning from long temporal\nsequences on graphs and improves long-term traffic forecasting accuracy. Our\nmodel can achieve up to 35 % better long-term traffic forecast accuracy than\nthat of several state-of-the-art methods. The attention-based scores from the\nX-GPA model provide spatial and temporal explanations based on the traffic\ndynamics, which change for normal vs. peak-hour traffic and weekday vs. weekend\ntraffic.",

    "abstract": "Experimental data is costly to obtain, which makes it difficult to calibrate\ncomplex models. For many models an experimental design that produces the best\ncalibration given a limited experimental budget is not obvious. This paper\nintroduces a deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for design of\nexperiments that maximizes the information gain measured by Kullback-Leibler\n(KL) divergence obtained via the Kalman filter (KF). This combination enables\nexperimental design for rapid online experiments where traditional methods are\ntoo costly. We formulate possible configurations of experiments as a decision\ntree and a Markov decision process (MDP), where a finite choice of actions is\navailable at each incremental step. Once an action is taken, a variety of\nmeasurements are used to update the state of the experiment. This new data\nleads to a Bayesian update of the parameters by the KF, which is used to\nenhance the state representation. In contrast to the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency\n(NSE) index, which requires additional sampling to test hypotheses for forward\npredictions, the KF can lower the cost of experiments by directly estimating\nthe values of new data acquired through additional actions. In this work our\napplications focus on mechanical testing of materials. Numerical experiments\nwith complex, history-dependent models are used to verify the implementation\nand benchmark the performance of the RL-designed experiments.",

    "abstract": "3D scene flow characterizes how the points at the current time flow to the\nnext time in the 3D Euclidean space, which possesses the capacity to infer\nautonomously the non-rigid motion of all objects in the scene. The previous\nmethods for estimating scene flow from images have limitations, which split the\nholistic nature of 3D scene flow by estimating optical flow and disparity\nseparately. Learning 3D scene flow from point clouds also faces the\ndifficulties of the gap between synthesized and real data and the sparsity of\nLiDAR point clouds. In this paper, the generated dense depth map is utilized to\nobtain explicit 3D coordinates, which achieves direct learning of 3D scene flow\nfrom 2D images. The stability of the predicted scene flow is improved by\nintroducing the dense nature of 2D pixels into the 3D space. Outliers in the\ngenerated 3D point cloud are removed by statistical methods to weaken the\nimpact of noisy points on the 3D scene flow estimation task. Disparity\nconsistency loss is proposed to achieve more effective unsupervised learning of\n3D scene flow. The proposed method of self-supervised learning of 3D scene flow\non real-world images is compared with a variety of methods for learning on the\nsynthesized dataset and learning on LiDAR point clouds. The comparisons of\nmultiple scene flow metrics are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness and\nsuperiority of introducing pseudo-LiDAR point cloud to scene flow estimation.",

Offline\nreinforcement learning uses previously-collected datasets to train agents\nwithout any interaction.

Previous conservative estimation methods are usually difficult to avoid\nthe impact of OOD actions on Q-value estimates. In addition, these algorithms\nusually need to lose some computational efficiency to achieve the purpose of\nconservative estimation.

However, existing privacy-preserving solutions are\ndesigned for tackling the privacy issue only during the model training and\nresults collection phases. The problem of privacy leakage still exists when\ndirectly sharing the private user interaction data with organizations or\nreleasing them to the public.

A three-step machine-learning-based framework was developed\nand tested to detect guardrail posts from the images captured by UAS. First, a\nguardrail detector was trained to localize the candidate locations of posts\nsupporting the guardrail. Since images were used in this process collected from\nan actual job site, several false detections were identified. Therefore,\nadditional constraints were introduced in the following steps to filter out\nfalse detections. Second, the research team applied a horizontal line detector\nto the image to properly detect floors and remove the detections that were not\nclose to the floors. Finally, since the guardrail posts are installed with\napproximately normal distribution between each post, the space between them was\nestimated and used to find the most likely distance between the two posts. The\nresearch team used various combinations of the developed approaches to monitor\nguardrail systems in the captured images from a high-rise building project.\nComparing the precision and recall metrics indicated that the cascade\nclassifier achieves better performance with floor detection and guardrail\nspacing estimation. The research outcomes illustrate that the proposed\nguardrail recognition system can improve the assessment of guardrails and\nfacilitate the safety engineer's task of identifying fall hazards in high-rise\nbuilding projects.",

Recent work applies it to autonomous 3D reconstruction by\nlearning information gain for view path planning. Effective as it is, the\ncomputation of the information gain is expensive, and compared with that using\nvolumetric representations, collision checking using the implicit\nrepresentation for a 3D point is much slower. In the paper, we propose to 1)\nleverage a neural network as an implicit function approximator for the\ninformation gain field and 2) combine the implicit fine-grained representation\nwith coarse volumetric representations to improve efficiency. Further with the\nimproved efficiency, we propose a novel informative path planning based on a\ngraph-based planner. Our method demonstrates significant improvements in the\nreconstruction quality and planning efficiency compared with autonomous\nreconstructions with implicit and explicit representations. We deploy the\nmethod on a real UAV and the results show that our method can plan informative\nviews and reconstruct a scene with high quality.",

    "abstract": "The level of autonomy is increasing in systems spanning multiple domains, but\nthese systems still experience failures. One way to mitigate the risk of\nfailures is to integrate human oversight of the autonomous systems and rely on\nthe human to take control when the autonomy fails. In this work, we formulate a\nmethod of collaborative decision making through action suggestions that\nimproves action selection without taking control of the system. Our approach\nuses each suggestion efficiently by incorporating the implicit information\nshared through suggestions to modify the agent's belief and achieves better\nperformance with fewer suggestions than naively following the suggested\nactions. We assume collaborative agents share the same objective and\ncommunicate through valid actions. By assuming the suggested action is\ndependent only on the state, we can incorporate the suggested action as an\nindependent observation of the environment. The assumption of a collaborative\nenvironment enables us to use the agent's policy to estimate the distribution\nover action suggestions. We propose two methods that use suggested actions and\ndemonstrate the approach through simulated experiments. The proposed\nmethodology results in increased performance while also being robust to\nsuboptimal suggestions.",

    "abstract": "Retrosynthesis is a major task for drug discovery. It is formulated as a\ngraph-generating problem by many existing approaches. Specifically, these\nmethods firstly identify the reaction center, and break target molecule\naccordingly to generate synthons. Reactants are generated by either adding\natoms sequentially to synthon graphs or directly adding proper leaving groups.\nHowever, both two strategies suffer since adding atoms results in a long\nprediction sequence which increases generation difficulty, while adding leaving\ngroups can only consider the ones in the training set which results in poor\ngeneralization. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end graph generation\nmodel for retrosynthesis prediction, which sequentially identifies the reaction\ncenter, generates the synthons, and adds motifs to the synthons to generate\nreactants. Since chemically meaningful motifs are bigger than atoms and smaller\nthan leaving groups, our method enjoys lower prediction complexity than adding\natoms and better generalization than adding leaving groups.

The core of\nour system is a novel Transformer-based motion generation model, namely\nMARIONET, which can generate diverse motions given action tags. Different from\nexisting motion generation models, MARIONET utilizes contextual information\nfrom the past motion clip and future action tag, dedicated to generating\nactions that can smoothly blend historical and future actions. Specifically,\nMARIONET first encodes target action tag and contextual information into an\naction-level latent code. The code is unfolded into frame-level control signals\nvia a time unrolling module, which could be then combined with other\nframe-level control signals like the target trajectory. Motion frames are then\ngenerated in an auto-regressive way. By sequentially applying MARIONET, the\nsystem NEURAL MARIONETTE can robustly generate long-term, multi-action motions\nwith the help of two simple schemes, namely \"Shadow Start\" and \"Action\nRevision\".

Experimental results show that the proposed method\nachieves excellent video quality and high robustness against geometric attacks,\ncompression, transcoding and camcorder recordings attacks.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel stroke-based rendering (SBR) method that\ntranslates images into vivid oil paintings. Previous SBR techniques usually\nformulate the oil painting problem as pixel-wise approximation. Different from\nthis technique route, we treat oil painting creation as an adaptive sampling\nproblem. Firstly, we compute a probability density map based on the texture\ncomplexity of the input image. Then we use the Voronoi algorithm to sample a\nset of pixels as the stroke anchors. Next, we search and generate an individual\noil stroke at each anchor. Finally, we place all the strokes on the canvas to\nobtain the oil painting. By adjusting the hyper-parameter maximum sampling\nprobability, we can control the oil painting fineness in a linear manner.\nComparison with existing state-of-the-art oil painting techniques shows that\nour results have higher fidelity and more realistic textures. A user opinion\ntest demonstrates that people behave more preference toward our oil paintings\nthan the results of other methods.

    "abstract": "Automaton based approaches have enabled robots to perform various complex\ntasks. However, most existing automaton based algorithms highly rely on the\nmanually customized representation of states for the considered task, limiting\nits applicability in deep reinforcement learning algorithms. To address this\nissue, by incorporating Transformer into reinforcement learning, we develop a\nDouble-Transformer-guided Temporal Logic framework (T2TL) that exploits the\nstructural feature of Transformer twice, i.e., first encoding the LTL\ninstruction via the Transformer module for efficient understanding of task\ninstructions during the training and then encoding the context variable via the\nTransformer again for improved task performance. Particularly, the LTL\ninstruction is specified by co-safe LTL. As a semantics-preserving rewriting\noperation, LTL progression is exploited to decompose the complex task into\nlearnable sub-goals, which not only converts non-Markovian reward decision\nprocess to Markovian ones, but also improves the sampling efficiency by\nsimultaneous learning of multiple sub-tasks. An environment-agnostic LTL\npre-training scheme is further incorporated to facilitate the learning of the\nTransformer module resulting in improved representation of LTL. The simulation\nand experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the T2TL framework.",

However,\nresearch on 360{\\deg} ISOD has not been widely explored due to the lack of\nlarge, complex, high-resolution, and well-labeled datasets. Towards this end,\nwe construct a large scale 360{\\deg} ISOD dataset with object-level pixel-wise\nannotation on equirectangular projection (ERP), which contains rich panoramic\nscenes with not less than 2K resolution and is the largest dataset for\n360{\\deg} ISOD by far to our best knowledge. By observing the data, we find\ncurrent methods face three significant challenges in panoramic scenarios:\ndiverse distortion degrees, discontinuous edge effects and changeable object\nscales. Inspired by humans' observing process, we propose a view-aware salient\nobject detection method based on a Sample Adaptive View Transformer (SAVT)\nmodule with two sub-modules to mitigate these issues. Specifically, the\nsub-module View Transformer (VT) contains three transform branches based on\ndifferent kinds of transformations to learn various features under different\nviews and heighten the model's feature toleration of distortion, edge effects\nand object scales. Moreover, the sub-module Sample Adaptive Fusion (SAF) is to\nadjust the weights of different transform branches based on various sample\nfeatures and make transformed enhanced features fuse more appropriately. The\nbenchmark results of 20 state-of-the-art ISOD methods reveal the constructed\ndataset is very challenging.

The characteristics of\nfrequent on-off ISLs, the highly dynamic network topology of satellite networks\nmake it face the challenges of routing strategy design as a delay/interruption\ntolerant network (DTN). As a deterministic dynamic routing algorithm, contact\ngraph routing (CGR) uses a contact plan to calculate the path and forward data,\nbut it still has problems such as high computational overhead, low prediction\naccuracy caused by ignoring queue delay, and overbooked problem caused by\nlimited cache. Therefore, we first start with the time-space resource contact\ngraph (TSRCG) to accurately characterize the time-varying and predictable\ncharacteristics of the satellite network and the network resource parameters\nunder multi-tasks. Then, we optimize the route-list computation and dynamic\nroute computation process to ensure task delivery and reduce the consumption of\nvarious resources, such as contact capacity, computing resources, and storage\nresources. And the resource optimization for the multi-task delivery guarantee\nalgorithm based on CGR (RMDG-CGR) strategy we propose is compared with standard\nCGR in ION 4.0.1. Finally, the simulation results show that the RMDG-CGR can\nachieve higher task delivery in advance and successful task delivery rate, save\ncontact volume occupancy rate, computing and storage resource, and the above\neffects are more prominent, especially in the task scenario with critical\nbundles.",

    "abstract": "Data-efficient image classification is a challenging task that aims to solve\nimage classification using small training data. Neural network-based deep\nlearning methods are effective for image classification, but they typically\nrequire large-scale training data and have major limitations such as requiring\nexpertise to design network architectures and having poor interpretability.\nEvolutionary deep learning is a recent hot topic that combines evolutionary\ncomputation with deep learning. However, most evolutionary deep learning\nmethods focus on evolving architectures of neural networks, which still suffer\nfrom limitations such as poor interpretability. To address this, this paper\nproposes a new genetic programming-based evolutionary deep learning approach to\ndata-efficient image classification. The new approach can automatically evolve\nvariable-length models using many important operators from both image and\nclassification domains. It can learn different types of image features from\ncolour or gray-scale images, and construct effective and diverse ensembles for\nimage classification. A flexible multi-layer representation enables the new\napproach to automatically construct shallow or deep models/trees for different\ntasks and perform effective transformations on the input data via multiple\ninternal nodes. The new approach is applied to solve five image classification\ntasks with different training set sizes. The results show that it achieves\nbetter performance in most cases than deep learning methods for data-efficient\nimage classification. A deep analysis shows that the new approach has good\nconvergence and evolves models with high interpretability, different\nlengths/sizes/shapes, and good transferability.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, with the large-scale deployment of space spacecraft entities\nand the increase of satellite onboard capabilities, delay/disruption tolerant\nnetwork (DTN) emerged as a more robust communication protocol than TCP/IP in\nthe case of excessive network dynamics. DTN node buffer management is still an\nactive area of research, as the current implementation of the DTN core protocol\nstill relies on the assumption that there is always enough memory available in\ndifferent network nodes to store and forward bundles. In addition, the\nclassical queuing theory does not apply to the dynamic management of DTN node\nbuffers. Therefore, this paper proposes a centralized approach to automatically\nmanage cognitive DTN nodes in low earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation\nscenarios based on the advanced reinforcement learning (RL) strategy advantage\nactor-critic (A2C). The method aims to explore training a geosynchronous earth\norbit intelligent agent to manage all DTN nodes in an LEO satellite\nconstellation scenario. The goal of the A2C agent is to maximize delivery\nsuccess rate and minimize network resource consumption cost while considering\nnode memory utilization. The intelligent agent can dynamically adjust the radio\ndata rate and perform drop operations based on bundle priority. In order to\nmeasure the effectiveness of applying A2C technology to DTN node management\nissues in LEO satellite constellation scenarios, this paper compares the\ntrained intelligent agent strategy with the other two non-RL policies,\nincluding random and standard policies. Experiments show that the A2C strategy\nbalances delivery success rate and cost, and provides the highest reward and\nthe lowest node memory utilization.",

    "abstract": "Traditional visualisations are designed to be shown on a flat surface (screen\nor page) but most data is not \"flat\". For example, the surface of the earth\nexists on a sphere, however, when that surface is presented on a flat map, key\ninformation is hidden, such as geographic paths on the spherical surface being\nwrapped across the boundaries of the flat map. Similarly, cyclical time-series\ndata has no beginning or end. When such cyclical data is presented on a\ntraditional linear chart, the viewer needs to perceive continuity of the\nvisualisation across the chart's boundaries. Mentally reconnecting the chart\nacross such a boundary may induce additional cognitive load. More complex data\nsuch as a network diagram with hundreds or thousands of links between data\npoints leads to a densely connected structure that is even less \"flat\" and\nneeds to wrap around in multiple dimensions. To improve the usability of these\nvisualisations, this thesis explores a novel class of interactive wrapped data\nvisualisations, i.e., visualisations that wrap around continuously when\ninteractively panned on a two-dimensional projection of surfaces of 3D shapes,\nspecifically, cylinder, torus, or sphere. We start with a systematic\nexploration of the design space of interactive wrapped visualisations,\ncharacterising the visualisations that help people understand the relationship\nwithin the data. Subsequently, we investigate a series of wrappable\nvisualisations for cyclical time series, network, and geographic data. We show\nthat these interactive visualisations better preserve the spatial relations in\nthe case of geospatial data, and better reveal the data's underlying structure\nin the case of abstract data such as networks and cyclical time series.\nFurthermore, to assist future research and development, we contribute layout\nalgorithms and toolkits to help create pannable wrapped visualisations.",

From the Point Pair Features (PPFs) of sparse\nlocal regions, rotation-invariant local geometry is encoded into geometric\ndescriptors. Global awareness of 3D structures and geometric context is\nsubsequently incorporated, both in a rotation-invariant fashion.

Geometric\ncontext from the whole scene is then globally aggregated into descriptors.\nFinally, the description of sparse regions is interpolated to dense point\ndescriptors, from which correspondences are extracted for registration. To\nvalidate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on both object- and\nscene-level data.

To obtain timely situational awareness, IoT devices continuously\nsample computation-intensive status updates, generate perception tasks and\noffload them to edge servers for processing. In this sense, the timeliness of\ninformation is considered as one major contextual attribute of status updates.\nIn this paper, we derive the closed-form expressions of timeliness of\ninformation for computation offloading at both edge tier and fog tier, where\ntwo stage tandem queues are exploited to abstract the transmission and\ncomputation process. Moreover, we exploit the statistical structure of\nGauss-Markov process, which is widely adopted to model temporal dynamics of\nsystem states, and derive the closed-form expression for process-related\ntimeliness of information. The obtained analytical formulas explicitly\ncharacterize the dependency among task generation, transmission and execution,\nwhich can serve as objective functions for system optimization. Based on the\ntheoretical results, we formulate a computation offloading optimization problem\nat edge tier, where the timeliness of status updates is minimized among\nmultiple devices by joint optimization of task generation, bandwidth\nallocation, and computation resource allocation. An iterative solution\nprocedure is proposed to solve the formulated problem. Numerical results reveal\nthe intertwined relationship among transmission and computation stages, and\nverify the necessity of factoring in the task generation process for\ncomputation offloading strategy design.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic optimization of the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC)\nis a crucial problem for machine learning. Although various algorithms have\nbeen extensively studied for AUPRC optimization, the generalization is only\nguaranteed in the multi-query case. In this work, we present the first trial in\nthe single-query generalization of stochastic AUPRC optimization. For sharper\ngeneralization bounds, we focus on algorithm-dependent generalization. There\nare both algorithmic and theoretical obstacles to our destination. From an\nalgorithmic perspective, we notice that the majority of existing stochastic\nestimators are biased only when the sampling strategy is biased, and is\nleave-one-out unstable due to the non-decomposability. To address these issues,\nwe propose a sampling-rate-invariant unbiased stochastic estimator with\nsuperior stability. On top of this, the AUPRC optimization is formulated as a\ncomposition optimization problem, and a stochastic algorithm is proposed to\nsolve this problem. From a theoretical perspective, standard techniques of the\nalgorithm-dependent generalization analysis cannot be directly applied to such\na listwise compositional optimization problem. To fill this gap, we extend the\nmodel stability from instancewise losses to listwise losses and bridge the\ncorresponding generalization and stability. Additionally, we construct state\ntransition matrices to describe the recurrence of the stability, and simplify\ncalculations by matrix spectrum. Practically, experimental results on three\nimage retrieval datasets on speak to the effectiveness and soundness of our\nframework.",

The RF links are assumed to\nbe subject to Rayleigh fading, and the FSO links are influenced by both\nGamma-Gamma atmospheric turbulence and pointing errors. On the basis of our\npreviously derived expression for cumulative distribution function of the\nequivalent signal-to-noise ratio of the whole system, we derive novel\nanalytical expressions for the average bit-error rate (BER) and ergodic\ncapacity that are presented in terms of the Meijer's G-function and extended\ngeneralized bivariate Meijer's G-function, respectively.

Yet, the\nnecessity of structuring constitutive models with an incremental formulation\nhas given rise to data-driven approaches where physical quantities, e.g.\ndeformation, blend with artificial, non-physical ones, such as the increments\nin deformation and time. Neural networks and the consequent constitutive models\ndepend, thus, on the particular incremental formulation, fail in identifying\nmaterial representations locally in time, and suffer from poor generalization.\nHere, we propose a new approach which allows, for the first time, to decouple\nthe material representation from the incremental formulation. Inspired by the\nThermodynamics-based Artificial Neural Networks (TANN) and the theory of the\ninternal variables, the evolution TANN (eTANN) are continuous-time, thus\nindependent of the aforementioned artificial quantities. Key feature of the\nproposed approach is the discovery of the evolution equations of the internal\nvariables in the form of ordinary differential equations, rather than in an\nincremental discrete-time form. In this work, we focus attention to juxtapose\nand show how the various general notions of solid mechanics are implemented in\neTANN. The laws of thermodynamics are hardwired in the structure of the network\nand allow predictions which are always consistent. We propose a methodology\nthat allows to discover, from data and first principles, admissible sets of\ninternal variables from the microscopic fields in complex materials.

    "abstract": "Machine Translation System (MTS) serves as an effective tool for\ncommunication by translating text or speech from one language to another\nlanguage. The need of an efficient translation system becomes obvious in a\nlarge multilingual environment like India, where English and a set of Indian\nLanguages (ILs) are officially used. In contrast with English, ILs are still\nentreated as low-resource languages due to unavailability of corpora. In order\nto address such asymmetric nature, multilingual neural machine translation\n(MNMT) system evolves as an ideal approach in this direction. In this paper, we\npropose a MNMT system to address the issues related to low-resource language\ntranslation. Our model comprises of two MNMT systems i.e. for English-Indic\n(one-to-many) and the other for Indic-English (many-to-one) with a shared\nencoder-decoder containing 15 language pairs (30 translation directions). Since\nmost of IL pairs have scanty amount of parallel corpora, not sufficient for\ntraining any machine translation model. We explore various augmentation\nstrategies to improve overall translation quality through the proposed model. A\nstate-of-the-art transformer architecture is used to realize the proposed\nmodel. Trials over a good amount of data reveal its superiority over the\nconventional models. In addition, the paper addresses the use of language\nrelationships (in terms of dialect, script, etc.), particularly about the role\nof high-resource languages of the same family in boosting the performance of\nlow-resource languages. Moreover, the experimental results also show the\nadvantage of backtranslation and domain adaptation for ILs to enhance the\ntranslation quality of both source and target languages. Using all these key\napproaches, our proposed model emerges to be more efficient than the baseline\nmodel in terms of evaluation metrics i.e BLEU (BiLingual Evaluation Understudy)\nscore for a set of ILs.",

Recent studies on passive NLOS\nmainly focus on steady-state measurement and reconstruction methods, which show\nlimitations in recognition of moving targets. To the best of our knowledge, we\npropose a novel event-based passive NLOS imaging method. We acquire\nasynchronous event-based data which contains detailed dynamic information of\nthe NLOS target, and efficiently ease the degradation of speckle caused by\nmovement. Besides, we create the first event-based NLOS imaging dataset,\nNLOS-ES, and the event-based feature is extracted by time-surface\nrepresentation. We compare the reconstructions through event-based data with\nframe-based data. The event-based method performs well on PSNR and LPIPS, which\nis 20% and 10% better than frame-based method, while the data volume takes only\n2% of traditional method.",

    "abstract": "Byzantine Reliable Broadcast (BRB) is a fundamental distributed computing\nprimitive, with applications ranging from notifications to asynchronous payment\nsystems. Motivated by practical consideration, we study Client-Server Byzantine\nReliable Broadcast (CSB), a multi-shot variant of BRB whose interface is split\nbetween broadcasting clients and delivering servers. We present Draft, an\noptimally resilient implementation of CSB. Like most implementations of BRB,\nDraft guarantees both liveness and safety in an asynchronous environment. Under\ngood conditions, however, Draft achieves unparalleled efficiency. In a moment\nof synchrony, free from Byzantine misbehaviour, and at the limit of infinitely\nmany broadcasting clients, a Draft server delivers a $b$-bits payload at an\nasymptotic amortized cost of $0$ signature verifications, and $\\log_2(c) + b$\nbits exchanged, where $c$ is the number of clients in the system. This is the\ninformation-theoretical minimum number of bits required to convey the payload\n($b$ bits, assuming it is compressed), along with an identifier for its sender\n($\\log_2(c)$ bits, necessary to enumerate any set of $c$ elements, and optimal\nif broadcasting frequencies are uniform or unknown). These two achievements\nhave profound practical implications. Real-world BRB implementations are often\nbottlenecked either by expensive signature verifications, or by communication\noverhead. For Draft, instead, the network is the limit: a server can deliver\npayloads as quickly as it would receive them from an infallible oracle.",

    "abstract": "Spatio-Temporal video grounding (STVG) focuses on retrieving the\nspatio-temporal tube of a specific object depicted by a free-form textual\nexpression. Existing approaches mainly treat this complicated task as a\nparallel frame-grounding problem and thus suffer from two types of\ninconsistency drawbacks: feature alignment inconsistency and prediction\ninconsistency. In this paper, we present an end-to-end one-stage framework,\ntermed Spatio-Temporal Consistency-Aware Transformer (STCAT), to alleviate\nthese issues. Specially, we introduce a novel multi-modal template as the\nglobal objective to address this task, which explicitly constricts the\ngrounding region and associates the predictions among all video frames.\nMoreover, to generate the above template under sufficient video-textual\nperception, an encoder-decoder architecture is proposed for effective global\ncontext modeling. Thanks to these critical designs, STCAT enjoys more\nconsistent cross-modal feature alignment and tube prediction without reliance\non any pre-trained object detectors. Extensive experiments show that our method\noutperforms previous state-of-the-arts with clear margins on two challenging\nvideo benchmarks (VidSTG and HC-STVG), illustrating the superiority of the\nproposed framework to better understanding the association between vision and\nnatural language.

    "abstract": "Cross-modal retrieval between videos and texts has gained increasing research\ninterest due to the rapid emergence of videos on the web. Generally, a video\ncontains rich instance and event information and the query text only describes\na part of the information. Thus, a video can correspond to multiple different\ntext descriptions and queries. We call this phenomenon the ``Video-Text\nCorrespondence Ambiguity'' problem. Current techniques mostly concentrate on\nmining local or multi-level alignment between contents of a video and text\n(\\textit{e.g.}, object to entity and action to verb). It is difficult for these\nmethods to alleviate the video-text correspondence ambiguity by describing a\nvideo using only one single feature, which is required to be matched with\nmultiple different text features at the same time. To address this problem, we\npropose a Text-Adaptive Multiple Visual Prototype Matching model, which\nautomatically captures multiple prototypes to describe a video by adaptive\naggregation of video token features. Given a query text, the similarity is\ndetermined by the most similar prototype to find correspondence in the video,\nwhich is termed text-adaptive matching. To learn diverse prototypes for\nrepresenting the rich information in videos, we propose a variance loss to\nencourage different prototypes to attend to different contents of the video.\nOur method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four public video retrieval\ndatasets.",

    "abstract": "Transformer architecture has become the fundamental element of the widespread\nnatural language processing~(NLP) models. With the trends of large NLP models,\nthe increasing memory and computation costs hinder their efficient deployment\non resource-limited devices. Therefore, transformer quantization attracts wide\nresearch interest. Recent work recognizes that structured outliers are the\ncritical bottleneck for quantization performance. However, their proposed\nmethods increase the computation overhead and still leave the outliers there.\nTo fundamentally address this problem, this paper delves into the inherent\ninducement and importance of the outliers. We discover that $\\boldsymbol\n\\gamma$ in LayerNorm (LN) acts as a sinful amplifier for the outliers, and the\nimportance of outliers varies greatly where some outliers provided by a few\ntokens cover a large area but can be clipped sharply without negative impacts.\nMotivated by these findings, we propose an outlier suppression framework\nincluding two components: Gamma Migration and Token-Wise Clipping. The Gamma\nMigration migrates the outlier amplifier to subsequent modules in an equivalent\ntransformation, contributing to a more quantization-friendly model without any\nextra burden. The Token-Wise Clipping takes advantage of the large variance of\ntoken range and designs a token-wise coarse-to-fine pipeline, obtaining a\nclipping range with minimal final quantization loss in an efficient way. This\nframework effectively suppresses the outliers and can be used in a\nplug-and-play mode. Extensive experiments prove that our framework surpasses\nthe existing works and, for the first time, pushes the 6-bit post-training BERT\nquantization to the full-precision (FP) level.

    "title": "SuperYOLO: Super Resolution Assisted Object Detection in Multimodal  Remote Sensing Imagery",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an accurate yet fast small object detection method\nfor RSI, named SuperYOLO, which fuses multimodal data and performs high\nresolution (HR) object detection on multiscale objects by utilizing the\nassisted super resolution (SR) learning and considering both the detection\naccuracy and computation cost. First, we construct a compact baseline by\nremoving the Focus module to keep the HR features and significantly overcomes\nthe missing error of small objects. Second, we utilize pixel-level multimodal\nfusion (MF) to extract information from various data to facilitate more\nsuitable and effective features for small objects in RSI. Furthermore, we\ndesign a simple and flexible SR branch to learn HR feature representations that\ncan discriminate small objects from vast backgrounds with low-resolution (LR)\ninput, thus further improving the detection accuracy. Moreover, to avoid\nintroducing additional computation, the SR branch is discarded in the inference\nstage and the computation of the network model is reduced due to the LR input.\nExperimental results show that, on the widely used VEDAI RS dataset, SuperYOLO\nachieves an accuracy of 73.61% (in terms of mAP50), which is more than 10%\nhigher than the SOTA large models such as YOLOv5l, YOLOv5x and RS designed\nYOLOrs. Meanwhile, the GFOLPs and parameter size of SuperYOLO are about 18.1x\nand 4.2x less than YOLOv5x. Our proposed model shows a favorable accuracy-speed\ntrade-off compared to the state-of-art models.

    "abstract": "COVID-19 significantly disrupted how educational contents are delivered in\nacademic institutions, rapidly accelerating the adoption of online and blended\nlearning. This thesis explores the creation and refinement of optimized student\nlearning communities as a mean to support online and blended learning in the\npandemic and post-pandemic setting. Students enrolled in university courses can\nbe modeled as an enrollment network akin to a circuit netlist. Learning\ncommunities are created by clustering students into groups, optimized for\nmaximum internal connection to support student learning, and minimum external\nconnection to reduce disease transmission. Three VLSI-based clustering\nalgorithms: Hyperedge Coarsening, Modified Hyperedge Coarsening, and Best\nChoice, are modified to cluster student enrollment networks. The learning\ncommunities created by the clustering algorithms are further refined by the\nSimulated Annealing algorithm using the same optimization criteria. The\nLearning Community Creation and Refinement Framework combines all three stages\nof network modeling, learning community creation, and learning community\nrefinement. The proposed framework is tested on both the 3rd year Electrical\nEngineering Fall 2020 enrollment dataset and a very large Fall 2020 and Winter\n2021 enrollment dataset. Best Choice performed the best among the clustering\nalgorithms, capable of creating learning communities for the optimization\ncriteria for a given maximum cluster size. Simulated Annealing can refine the\nclustering results by significantly increase cluster quality. The framework is\ncapable of creating and refining learning communities for both the small and\nthe large enrollment networks, but it is better suited for creating tailored\nlearning communities at a program level. Future work, including creating\nstudent learning communities based on other optimization criteria, should be\nexplored.",

Recent works solve this task by directly encoding the\nquery using large pre-trained language models (PLM). However, isolating the\neffects of the improved language representations is difficult, as these works\nalso propose improvements in the visual inputs. Furthermore, these PLMs\nsignificantly increase the computational cost of training TVG models.\nTherefore, this paper studies the effects of PLMs in the TVG task and assesses\nthe applicability of NLP parameter-efficient training alternatives based on\nadapters. We couple popular PLMs with a selection of existing approaches and\ntest different adapters to reduce the impact of the additional parameters. Our\nresults on three challenging datasets show that TVG models could greatly\nbenefit from PLMs when these are fine-tuned for the task and that adapters are\nan effective alternative to full fine-tuning, even though they are not tailored\nfor our task. Concretely, adapters helped save on computational cost, allowing\nPLM integration in larger TVG models and delivering results comparable to the\nstate-of-the-art models.

    "abstract": "Light-weight time-of-flight (ToF) depth sensors are small, cheap, low-energy\nand have been massively deployed on mobile devices for the purposes like\nautofocus, obstacle detection, etc. However, due to their specific measurements\n(depth distribution in a region instead of the depth value at a certain pixel)\nand extremely low resolution, they are insufficient for applications requiring\nhigh-fidelity depth such as 3D reconstruction. In this paper, we propose\nDELTAR, a novel method to empower light-weight ToF sensors with the capability\nof measuring high resolution and accurate depth by cooperating with a color\nimage. As the core of DELTAR, a feature extractor customized for depth\ndistribution and an attention-based neural architecture is proposed to fuse the\ninformation from the color and ToF domain efficiently. To evaluate our system\nin real-world scenarios, we design a data collection device and propose a new\napproach to calibrate the RGB camera and ToF sensor. Experiments show that our\nmethod produces more accurate depth than existing frameworks designed for depth\ncompletion and depth super-resolution and achieves on par performance with a\ncommodity-level RGB-D sensor.

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely applied for purposes of\ninspection, search, and rescue operations by the virtue of low-cost,\nlarge-coverage, real-time, and high-resolution data acquisition capacities.\nMassive volumes of aerial videos are produced in these processes, in which\nnormal events often account for an overwhelming proportion. It is extremely\ndifficult to localize and extract abnormal events containing potentially\nvaluable information from long video streams manually. Therefore, we are\ndedicated to developing anomaly detection methods to solve this issue. In this\npaper, we create a new dataset, named DroneAnomaly, for anomaly detection in\naerial videos. This dataset provides 37 training video sequences and 22 testing\nvideo sequences from 7 different realistic scenes with various anomalous\nevents. There are 87,488 color video frames (51,635 for training and 35,853 for\ntesting) with the size of $640 \\times 640$ at 30 frames per second. Based on\nthis dataset, we evaluate existing methods and offer a benchmark for this task.\nFurthermore, we present a new baseline model, ANomaly Detection with\nTransformers (ANDT), which treats consecutive video frames as a sequence of\ntubelets, utilizes a Transformer encoder to learn feature representations from\nthe sequence, and leverages a decoder to predict the next frame. Our network\nmodels normality in the training phase and identifies an event with\nunpredictable temporal dynamics as an anomaly in the test phase. Moreover, To\ncomprehensively evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we use not\nonly our Drone-Anomaly dataset but also another dataset.

An extensive understanding of the system\nphysics and its uncertainties is then necessary in order to push control design\nto the limits of performance and constrains the choice of the set of sensors\nand actuators. A multi-body framework, the TITOP approach, is used to build all\nthe elementary flexible bodies and mechanisms involved in a fine pointing\nmission.

    "abstract": "In this paper we address the problem of neural face reenactment, where, given\na pair of a source and a target facial image, we need to transfer the target's\npose (defined as the head pose and its facial expressions) to the source image,\nby preserving at the same time the source's identity characteristics (e.g.,\nfacial shape, hair style, etc), even in the challenging case where the source\nand the target faces belong to different identities. In doing so, we address\nsome of the limitations of the state-of-the-art works, namely, a) that they\ndepend on paired training data (i.e., source and target faces have the same\nidentity), b) that they rely on labeled data during inference, and c) that they\ndo not preserve identity in large head pose changes. More specifically, we\npropose a framework that, using unpaired randomly generated facial images,\nlearns to disentangle the identity characteristics of the face from its pose by\nincorporating the recently introduced style space $\\mathcal{S}$ of StyleGAN2, a\nlatent representation space that exhibits remarkable disentanglement\nproperties. By capitalizing on this, we learn to successfully mix a pair of\nsource and target style codes using supervision from a 3D model. The resulting\nlatent code, that is subsequently used for reenactment, consists of latent\nunits corresponding to the facial pose of the target only and of units\ncorresponding to the identity of the source only, leading to notable\nimprovement in the reenactment performance compared to recent state-of-the-art\nmethods. In comparison to state of the art, we quantitatively and qualitatively\nshow that the proposed method produces higher quality results even on extreme\npose variations. Finally, we report results on real images by first embedding\nthem on the latent space of the pretrained generator.

    "abstract": "Although numerous methods to reduce the overfitting of convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) exist, it is still not clear how to confidently measure the\ndegree of overfitting. A metric reflecting the overfitting level might be,\nhowever, extremely helpful for the comparison of different architectures and\nfor the evaluation of various techniques to tackle overfitting. Motivated by\nthe fact that overfitted neural networks tend to rather memorize noise in the\ntraining data than generalize to unseen data, we examine how the training\naccuracy changes in the presence of increasing data perturbations and study the\nconnection to overfitting. While previous work focused on label noise only, we\nexamine a spectrum of techniques to inject noise into the training data,\nincluding adversarial perturbations and input corruptions. Based on this, we\ndefine two new metrics that can confidently distinguish between correct and\noverfitted models. For the evaluation, we derive a pool of models for which the\noverfitting behavior is known beforehand. To test the effect of various\nfactors, we introduce several anti-overfitting measures in architectures based\non VGG and ResNet and study their impact, including regularization techniques,\ntraining set size, and the number of parameters. Finally, we assess the\napplicability of the proposed metrics by measuring the overfitting degree of\nseveral CNN architectures outside of our model pool.",

    "title": "Efficient Fault Detection Architecture of Bit-Parallel Multiplier in  Polynomial Basis of GF(2m) Using BCH Code",
    "abstract": "The finite field multiplier is mainly used in many of today's state of the\nart digital systems and its hardware implementation for bit parallel operation\nmay require millions of logic gates. Natural causes or soft errors in digital\ndesign could cause some of these gates to malfunction in the field, which could\ncause the multiplier to produce incorrect outputs. To ensure that they are not\nsusceptible to error, it is crucial to use a finite field multiplier\nimplementation that is effective and has a high fault detection capability. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel fault detection scheme for a recent bit-parallel\npolynomial basis multiplier over GF(2m), where the proposed method aims at\nobtaining high fault detection performance for finite field multipliers and\nmeanwhile maintain low-complexity implementation which is favored in resource\nconstrained applications such as smart cards. The proposed method is based on\nBCH error correction codes, with an area-delay efficient architecture. The\nexperimental results show that for 45-bit multiplier with 5-bit errors the\nproposed error detection and correction architecture results in 37% and %49\nreduction in critical path delay with compared to the existing method in [18].\nMoreover, the area overhead for 45-bit multiplier with 5 errors is within 80%\nwhich is significantly lower than the best existing BCH based fault detection\nmethod in finite field multiplier [18].",

In the\nframework of ordinary differential equations, this is very natural to try to\nextend the approach to classes of functions over the reals, and not only over\nthe integers. Recently, an extension of previous characterization was obtained\nfor functions from the integers to the reals, but the method used in the proof,\nbased on the existence of a continuous function from the integers to a suitable\ndiscrete set of reals, cannot extend to functions from the reals to the reals,\nas such a function cannot exist for clear topological reasons. In this article,\nwe prove that this is indeed possible to provide an elegant and simple\nalgebraic characterization of functions from the reals to the reals: we provide\na characterization of such functions as the smallest class of functions that\ncontains some basic functions, and that is closed by composition, linear length\nODEs, and a natural effective limit schema. This is obtained using an\nalternative proof technique based on the construction of specific suitable\nfunctions defined recursively, and a barycentric method.

To fit the\npowerful neural session-based recommendation models in resource-constrained\nmobile devices, tensor-train decomposition and its variants have been widely\napplied to reduce memory footprint by decomposing the embedding table into\nsmaller tensors, showing great potential in compressing recommendation models.\nHowever, these model compression techniques significantly increase the local\ninference time due to the complex process of generating index lists and a\nseries of tensor multiplications to form item embeddings, and the resultant\non-device recommender fails to provide real-time response and recommendation.\nTo improve the online recommendation efficiency, we propose to learn\ncompositional encoding-based compact item representations. Specifically, each\nitem is represented by a compositional code that consists of several codewords,\nand we learn embedding vectors to represent each codeword instead of each item.\nThen the composition of the codeword embedding vectors from different embedding\nmatrices (i.e., codebooks) forms the item embedding. Since the size of\ncodebooks can be extremely small, the recommender model is thus able to fit in\nresource-constrained devices and meanwhile can save the codebooks for fast\nlocal inference.Besides, to prevent the loss of model capacity caused by\ncompression, we propose a bidirectional self-supervised knowledge distillation\nframework.

    "title": "Resource Allocation for Mobile Metaverse with the Internet of Vehicles  over 6G Wireless Communications: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach",
    "abstract": "Improving the interactivity and interconnectivity between people is one of\nthe highlights of the Metaverse. The Metaverse relies on a core approach,\ndigital twinning, which is a means to replicate physical world objects, people,\nactions and scenes onto the virtual world. Being able to access scenes and\ninformation associated with the physical world, in the Metaverse in real-time\nand under mobility, is essential in developing a highly accessible, interactive\nand interconnective experience for all users. This development allows users\nfrom other locations to access high-quality real-world and up-to-date\ninformation about events happening in another location, and socialize with\nothers hyper-interactively. Nevertheless, receiving continual, smooth updates\ngenerated by others from the Metaverse is a challenging task due to the large\ndata size of the virtual world graphics and the need for low latency\ntransmission. With the development of Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR), users can\ninteract via the Metaverse in a highly interactive manner, even under mobility.\nHence in our work, we considered an environment with users in moving Internet\nof Vehicles (IoV), downloading real-time virtual world updates from Metaverse\nService Provider Cell Stations (MSPCSs) via wireless communications. We design\nan environment with multiple cell stations, where there will be a handover of\nusers' virtual world graphic download tasks between cell stations. As\ntransmission latency is the primary concern in receiving virtual world updates\nunder mobility, our work aims to allocate system resources to minimize the\ntotal time taken for users in vehicles to download their virtual world scenes\nfrom the cell stations. We utilize deep reinforcement learning and evaluate the\nperformance of the algorithms under different environmental configurations. Our\nwork provides a use case of the Metaverse over AI-enabled 6G communications.",

Our analytical results show that the user\ncan examine more items in the carousel click model than in a single ranked\nlist, due to the structured way of browsing.

    "abstract": "Shapley value is a popular approach for measuring the influence of individual\nfeatures. While Shapley feature attribution is built upon desiderata from game\ntheory, some of its constraints may be less natural in certain machine learning\nsettings, leading to unintuitive model interpretation. In particular, the\nShapley value uses the same weight for all marginal contributions -- i.e. it\ngives the same importance when a large number of other features are given\nversus when a small number of other features are given. This property can be\nproblematic if larger feature sets are more or less informative than smaller\nfeature sets. Our work performs a rigorous analysis of the potential\nlimitations of Shapley feature attribution. We identify simple settings where\nthe Shapley value is mathematically suboptimal by assigning larger attributions\nfor less influential features. Motivated by this observation, we propose\nWeightedSHAP, which generalizes the Shapley value and learns which marginal\ncontributions to focus directly from data. On several real-world datasets, we\ndemonstrate that the influential features identified by WeightedSHAP are better\nable to recapitulate the model's predictions compared to the features\nidentified by the Shapley value.",

Given the abundance and omnipresence of smart devices,\n\"smart ecosystems\" are being formed where sensing happens simultaneously rather\nthan standalone. This is shifting the on-device inference paradigm towards\ndeploying centralised neural processing units (NPUs) at the edge, where\nmultiple devices (e.g. in smart homes or autonomous vehicles) can stream their\ndata for processing with dynamic rates. While this provides enhanced potential\nfor input batching, naive solutions can lead to subpar performance and quality\nof experience, especially under spiking loads. At the same time, the deployment\nof dynamic DNNs, comprising stochastic computation graphs (e.g. early-exit (EE)\nmodels), introduces a new dimension of dynamic behaviour in such systems. In\nthis work, we propose a novel early-exit-aware scheduling algorithm that allows\nsample preemption at run time, to account for the dynamicity introduced both by\nthe arrival and early-exiting processes. At the same time, we introduce two\nnovel dimensions to the design space of the NPU hardware architecture, namely\nFluid Batching and Stackable Processing Elements, that enable run-time\nadaptability to different batch sizes and significantly improve the NPU\nutilisation even at small batch sizes.

This article proposes\nBanglaSarc, a dataset constructed specifically for bangla textual data sarcasm\ndetection. This dataset contains of 5112 comments/status and contents collected\nfrom various online social platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, along with a\nfew online blogs. Due to the limited amount of data collection of categorized\ncomments in Bengali, this dataset will aid in the of study identifying sarcasm,\nrecognizing people's emotion, detecting various types of Bengali expressions,\nand other domains. The dataset is publicly available at\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakibapon/banglasarc.",

    "abstract": "Recently, there have merged a class of task-oriented dialogue (TOD) datasets\ncollected through Wizard-of-Oz simulated games. However, the Wizard-of-Oz data\nare in fact simulated data and thus are fundamentally different from real-life\nconversations, which are more noisy and casual. Recently, the SereTOD challenge\nis organized and releases the MobileCS dataset, which consists of real-world\ndialog transcripts between real users and customer-service staffs from China\nMobile. Based on the MobileCS dataset, the SereTOD challenge has two tasks, not\nonly evaluating the construction of the dialogue system itself, but also\nexamining information extraction from dialog transcripts, which is crucial for\nbuilding the knowledge base for TOD. This paper mainly presents a baseline\nstudy of the two tasks with the MobileCS dataset. We introduce how the two\nbaselines are constructed, the problems encountered, and the results. We\nanticipate that the baselines can facilitate exciting future research to build\nhuman-robot dialogue systems for real-life tasks.",

    "title": "AdaFocusV3: On Unified Spatial-temporal Dynamic Video Recognition",
    "abstract": "Recent research has revealed that reducing the temporal and spatial\nredundancy are both effective approaches towards efficient video recognition,\ne.g., allocating the majority of computation to a task-relevant subset of\nframes or the most valuable image regions of each frame. However, in most\nexisting works, either type of redundancy is typically modeled with another\nabsent. This paper explores the unified formulation of spatial-temporal dynamic\ncomputation on top of the recently proposed AdaFocusV2 algorithm, contributing\nto an improved AdaFocusV3 framework. Our method reduces the computational cost\nby activating the expensive high-capacity network only on some small but\ninformative 3D video cubes. These cubes are cropped from the space formed by\nframe height, width, and video duration, while their locations are adaptively\ndetermined with a light-weighted policy network on a per-sample basis. At test\ntime, the number of the cubes corresponding to each video is dynamically\nconfigured, i.e., video cubes are processed sequentially until a sufficiently\nreliable prediction is produced. Notably, AdaFocusV3 can be effectively trained\nby approximating the non-differentiable cropping operation with the\ninterpolation of deep features. Extensive empirical results on six benchmark\ndatasets (i.e., ActivityNet, FCVID, Mini-Kinetics, Something-Something V1&V2\nand Diving48) demonstrate that our model is considerably more efficient than\ncompetitive baselines.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has achieved great success in the challenging circuit\nannotation task by employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for the\nsegmentation of circuit structures. The deep learning approaches require a\nlarge amount of manually annotated training data to achieve a good performance,\nwhich could cause a degradation in performance if a deep learning model trained\non a given dataset is applied to a different dataset. This is commonly known as\nthe domain shift problem for circuit annotation, which stems from the possibly\nlarge variations in distribution across different image datasets. The different\nimage datasets could be obtained from different devices or different layers\nwithin a single device. To address the domain shift problem, we propose\nHistogram-gated Image Translation (HGIT), an unsupervised domain adaptation\nframework which transforms images from a given source dataset to the domain of\na target dataset, and utilize the transformed images for training a\nsegmentation network. Specifically, our HGIT performs generative adversarial\nnetwork (GAN)-based image translation and utilizes histogram statistics for\ndata curation. Experiments were conducted on a single labeled source dataset\nadapted to three different target datasets (without labels for training) and\nthe segmentation performance was evaluated for each target dataset. We have\ndemonstrated that our method achieves the best performance compared to the\nreported domain adaptation techniques, and is also reasonably close to the\nfully supervised benchmark.",

Secondly, Google Drive Cloud was used for\ntraining purposes to revisit the algorithmic implementation and training.\nLastly, the LOCO dataset was examined, if it is possible to achieve the same\ntraining results in comparison to the original publications.\nFindings: The mean average precision, a common benchmark in object detection,\nachieved in our study was 64.54%, and shows a significant increase from the\ninitial study of the LOCO authors, achieving 41%. However, improvement\npotential is seen specifically within object types of forklifts and pallet\ntruck.\nOriginality: This paper presents the first critical replication study of the\nLOCO dataset for object detection in intralogistics.

In some cases, HUSPM can not provide an excellent measure to\npredict what will happen. High utility sequential rule mining (HUSRM) discovers\nhigh utility and high confidence sequential rules, allowing it to solve the\nproblem in HUSPM. All existing HUSRM algorithms aim to find high-utility\npartially-ordered sequential rules (HUSRs), which are not consistent with\nreality and may generate fake HUSRs. Therefore, in this paper, we formulate the\nproblem of high utility totally-ordered sequential rule mining and propose two\nnovel algorithms, called TotalSR and TotalSR+, which aim to identify all high\nutility totally-ordered sequential rules (HTSRs). TotalSR creates a utility\ntable that can efficiently calculate antecedent support and a utility prefix\nsum list that can compute the remaining utility in O(1) time for a sequence. We\nalso introduce a left-first expansion strategy that can utilize the\nanti-monotonic property to use a confidence pruning strategy. TotalSR can also\ndrastically reduce the search space with the help of utility upper bounds\npruning strategies, avoiding much more meaningless computation. In addition,\nTotalSR+ uses an auxiliary antecedent record table to more efficiently discover\nHTSRs. Finally, there are numerous experimental results on both real and\nsynthetic datasets demonstrating that TotalSR is significantly more efficient\nthan algorithms with fewer pruning strategies, and TotalSR+ is significantly\nmore efficient than TotalSR in terms of running time and scalability.",

Visual tracking algorithms which follow the objects manipulated\nby the camera wearer can provide useful information to effectively model such\ninteractions.

This paper aims to\nprovide answers to such questions. We present the first systematic\ninvestigation of single object tracking in FPV. Our study extensively analyses\nthe performance of 42 algorithms including generic object trackers and baseline\nFPV-specific trackers. The analysis is carried out by focusing on different\naspects of the FPV setting, introducing new performance measures, and in\nrelation to FPV-specific tasks. The study is made possible through the\nintroduction of TREK-150, a novel benchmark dataset composed of 150 densely\nannotated video sequences. Our results show that object tracking in FPV poses\nnew challenges to current visual trackers. We highlight the factors causing\nsuch behavior and point out possible research directions.

However, due to the lack of accurate estimated depth,\nexisting multi-camera methods often generate multiple bounding boxes along a\nray of depth direction for difficult small objects such as pedestrians,\nresulting in an extremely low recall. Furthermore, directly applying depth\nprediction modules to existing multi-camera methods, generally composed of\nlarge network architectures, cannot meet the real-time requirements of\nself-driving applications.

The\nneural-network editing mechanism further modifies network links and activation\nfunctions consistently with physical knowledge. As an extension, we also\npropose a self-correcting Phy-Taylor framework that introduces two additional\ncapabilities: (i) physics-model-based safety relationship learning, and (ii)\nautomatic output correction when violations of safety occur.

The resulting functional connectivity\nmatrix (FCM) is often taken to represent the adjacency matrix of a brain graph.\nRecently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been successfully applied to FCMs\nto learn brain graph representations. A common limitation of existing GNN\napproaches, however, is that they require the graph adjacency matrix to be\nknown prior to model training. As such, it is implicitly assumed the\nground-truth dependency structure of the data is known. Unfortunately, for fMRI\nthis is not the case as the choice of which statistical measure best represents\nthe dependency structure of the data is non-trivial. Also, most GNN\napplications to fMRI assume FC is static over time, which is at odds with\nneuroscientific evidence that functional brain networks are time-varying and\ndynamic. These compounded issues can have a detrimental effect on the capacity\nof GNNs to learn representations of brain graphs. As a solution, we propose\nDynamic Brain Graph Structure Learning (DBGSL), a supervised method for\nlearning the optimal time-varying dependency structure of fMRI data.\nSpecifically, DBGSL learns a dynamic graph from fMRI timeseries via\nspatial-temporal attention applied to brain region embeddings. The resulting\ngraph is then fed to a spatial-temporal GNN to learn a graph representation for\nclassification. Experiments on large resting-state as well as task fMRI\ndatasets for the task of gender classification demonstrate that DBGSL achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance. Moreover, analysis of the learnt dynamic graphs\nhighlights prediction-related brain regions which align with findings from\nexisting neuroscience literature.",

    "abstract": "Numerous attempts have been made to the task of person-agnostic face swapping\ngiven its wide applications. While existing methods mostly rely on tedious\nnetwork and loss designs, they still struggle in the information balancing\nbetween the source and target faces, and tend to produce visible artifacts. In\nthis work, we introduce a concise and effective framework named StyleSwap. Our\ncore idea is to leverage a style-based generator to empower high-fidelity and\nrobust face swapping, thus the generator's advantage can be adopted for\noptimizing identity similarity. We identify that with only minimal\nmodifications, a StyleGAN2 architecture can successfully handle the desired\ninformation from both source and target. Additionally, inspired by the ToRGB\nlayers, a Swapping-Driven Mask Branch is further devised to improve information\nblending. Furthermore, the advantage of StyleGAN inversion can be adopted.\nParticularly, a Swapping-Guided ID Inversion strategy is proposed to optimize\nidentity similarity. Extensive experiments validate that our framework\ngenerates high-quality face swapping results that outperform state-of-the-art\nmethods both qualitatively and quantitatively.",

    "abstract": "The peer merit review of research proposals has been the major mechanism for\ndeciding grant awards. However, research proposals have become increasingly\ninterdisciplinary. It has been a longstanding challenge to assign\ninterdisciplinary proposals to appropriate reviewers, so proposals are fairly\nevaluated. One of the critical steps in reviewer assignment is to generate\naccurate interdisciplinary topic labels for proposal-reviewer matching.\nExisting systems mainly collect topic labels manually generated by principal\ninvestigators. However, such human-reported labels can be non-accurate,\nincomplete, labor intensive, and time costly. What role can AI play in\ndeveloping a fair and precise proposal reviewer assignment system? In this\nstudy, we collaborate with the National Science Foundation of China to address\nthe task of automated interdisciplinary topic path detection. For this purpose,\nwe develop a deep Hierarchical Interdisciplinary Research Proposal\nClassification Network (HIRPCN). Specifically, we first propose a hierarchical\ntransformer to extract the textual semantic information of proposals. We then\ndesign an interdisciplinary graph and leverage GNNs for learning\nrepresentations of each discipline in order to extract interdisciplinary\nknowledge. After extracting the semantic and interdisciplinary knowledge, we\ndesign a level-wise prediction component to fuse the two types of knowledge\nrepresentations and detect interdisciplinary topic paths for each proposal.

This combination accounts for (i) a\nuser's decreasing propensity to observe items further down a list and (ii) full\ndistributional shifts as opposed to point estimates. We evaluate RADio's\nability to reflect five normative concepts in news recommendations on the\nMicrosoft News Dataset and six (neural) recommendation algorithms, with the\nhelp of our metadata enrichment pipeline.

    "abstract": "Time series data appears in a variety of applications such as smart\ntransportation and environmental monitoring. One of the fundamental problems\nfor time series analysis is time series forecasting. Despite the success of\nrecent deep time series forecasting methods, they require sufficient\nobservation of historical values to make accurate forecasting. In other words,\nthe ratio of the output length (or forecasting horizon) to the sum of the input\nand output lengths should be low enough (e.g., 0.3). As the ratio increases\n(e.g., to 0.8), the uncertainty for the forecasting accuracy increases\nsignificantly. In this paper, we show both theoretically and empirically that\nthe uncertainty could be effectively reduced by retrieving relevant time series\nas references. In the theoretical analysis, we first quantify the uncertainty\nand show its connections to the Mean Squared Error (MSE). Then we prove that\nmodels with references are easier to learn than models without references since\nthe retrieved references could reduce the uncertainty. To empirically\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the retrieval based time series forecasting\nmodels, we introduce a simple yet effective two-stage method, called ReTime\nconsisting of a relational retrieval and a content synthesis. We also show that\nReTime can be easily adapted to the spatial-temporal time series and time\nseries imputation settings.

Given their capabilities to build an approximate and\ncontinuously updated model of the wireless network environments, DRL algorithms\ncan deal with the multifaceted complexity of such environments. Nevertheless,\nseveral challenges hinder the practical adoption of DRL in commercial networks.\nIn this article, we first discuss two key practical challenges that are faced\nbut rarely tackled when developing DRL-based RRM solutions. We argue that it is\ninevitable to address these DRL-related challenges for DRL to find its way to\nRRM commercial solutions. In particular, we discuss the need to have safe and\naccelerated DRL-based RRM solutions that mitigate the slow convergence and\nperformance instability exhibited by DRL algorithms. We then review and\ncategorize the main approaches used in the RRM domain to develop safe and\naccelerated DRL-based solutions. Finally, a case study is conducted to\ndemonstrate the importance of having safe and accelerated DRL-based RRM\nsolutions. We employ multiple variants of transfer learning (TL) techniques to\naccelerate the convergence of intelligent radio access network (RAN) slicing\nDRL-based controllers.

Recently, machine learning (ML)-based,\nespecially reinforcement learning (RL)-based control methods have received much\nattention. However, there is little discussion about the generalisation ability\nof the trained RL models. This paper points out that an RL agent trained in a\nspecific indoor environment is room-dependent, and cannot directly serve new\nheterogeneous environments. Therefore, in the context of Open Radio Access\nNetwork (O-RAN), this paper proposes a distributed cell power-control scheme\nbased on Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL). Models in different indoor\nenvironments are aggregated to the global model during the training process,\nand then the central server broadcasts the updated model back to each client.\nThe model will also be used as the base model for adaptive training in the new\nenvironment. The simulation results show that the FRL model has similar\nperformance to a single RL agent, and both are better than the random power\nallocation method and exhaustive search method.

    "abstract": "Affective computing has garnered researchers' attention and interest in\nrecent years as there is a need for AI systems to better understand and react\nto human emotions. However, analyzing human emotions, such as mood or stress,\nis quite complex. While various stress studies use facial expressions and\nwearables, most existing datasets rely on processing data from a single\nmodality. This paper presents EmpathicSchool, a novel dataset that captures\nfacial expressions and the associated physiological signals, such as heart\nrate, electrodermal activity, and skin temperature, under different stress\nlevels. The data was collected from 20 participants at different sessions for\n26 hours. The data includes nine different signal types, including both\ncomputer vision and physiological features that can be used to detect stress.\nIn addition, various experiments were conducted to validate the signal quality.",

Compared with\nzero-shot or openset segmentation, FreeSeg doesn't require any annotated masks,\nand it widely predicts categories beyond class-agnostic unsupervised\nsegmentation. Specifically, FreeSeg obtains free mask from Image-Text\nSimilarity Map (ITSM) of Interpretable Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining\n(ICLIP). And our core improvements are the smoothed min pooling for dense\nICLIP, with the partial label and pixel strategies for segmentation.\nFurthermore, FreeSeg is very straight forward without complex design like\ngrouping, clustering or retrieval. Besides the simplicity, the performances of\nFreeSeg surpass previous state-of-the-art at large margins, e.g. 13.4% higher\nat mIoU on VOC dataset in the same settings.",

Inspired by the\ninnate tree structure of the underlying math expressions, we re-arrange the\nspace of optimizers into a super-tree, where each path encodes an optimizer.\nThis way, optimizer search can be naturally formulated as a path-finding\nproblem, allowing a variety of well-established tree traversal methods to be\nused as the search algorithm. We adopt an adaptation of the Monte Carlo method\nto tree search, equipped with rejection sampling and equivalent- form detection\nthat leverage the characteristics of optimizer update rules to further boost\nthe sample efficiency.

While a large body of work has\nexplored how AI systems can be optimized to produce accurate and fair advice\nand how algorithmic advice should be presented to human decision makers, in\nthis work we ask a different basic question: When should algorithms provide\nadvice? Motivated by limitations of the current practice of constantly\nproviding algorithmic advice, we propose the design of AI systems that interact\nwith the human user in a two-sided manner and provide advice only when it is\nlikely to be beneficial to the human in making their decision. Our AI systems\nlearn advising policies using past human decisions. Then, for new cases, the\nlearned policies utilize input from the human to identify cases where\nalgorithmic advice would be useful, as well as those where the human is better\noff deciding alone. We conduct a large-scale experiment to evaluate our\napproach by using data from the US criminal justice system on pretrial-release\ndecisions. In our experiment, participants were asked to assess the risk of\ndefendants to violate their release terms if released and were advised by\ndifferent advising approaches. The results show that our interactive-advising\napproach manages to provide advice at times of need and to significantly\nimprove human decision making compared to fixed, non-interactive advising\napproaches. Our approach has additional advantages in facilitating human\nlearning, preserving complementary strengths of human decision makers, and\nleading to more positive responsiveness to the advice.",

Recently, significant efforts have been made to capture\nhumans interacting with their own environments as they go about their daily\nactivities. In result, several large egocentric datasets of interaction-rich\nmulti-modal data have emerged. However, learning representations from videos\ncan be challenging. First, given the uncurated nature of long-form continuous\nvideos, learning effective representations require focusing on moments in time\nwhen interactions take place. Second, visual representations of daily\nactivities should be sensitive to changes in the state of the environment.\nHowever, current successful multi-modal learning frameworks encourage\nrepresentation invariance over time. To address these challenges, we leverage\naudio signals to identify moments of likely interactions which are conducive to\nbetter learning. We also propose a novel self-supervised objective that learns\nfrom audible state changes caused by interactions. We validate these\ncontributions extensively on two large-scale egocentric datasets,\nEPIC-Kitchens-100 and the recently released Ego4D, and show improvements on\nseveral downstream tasks, including action recognition, long-term action\nanticipation, and object state change classification.",

In\nthis work, we introduce the use of semantic relationships between pairs of\ncolumns in a table to improve the accuracy of union search. Consequently, we\nintroduce a new notion of unionability that considers relationships between\ncolumns, together with the semantics of columns, in a principled way. To do so,\nwe present two new methods to discover semantic relationship between pairs of\ncolumns.

We show that our new unionability\nsearch algorithm, called SANTOS, outperforms a state-of-the-art union search\nthat uses a wide variety of column-based semantics, including word embeddings\nand regular expressions.

While the brain solves this blind source separation (BSS) problem\ncontinuously, its algorithms remain unknown. Previous work on\nbiologically-plausible BSS algorithms assumed that observed signals are linear\nmixtures of statistically independent or uncorrelated sources, limiting the\ndomain of applicability of these algorithms. To overcome this limitation, we\npropose novel biologically-plausible neural networks for the blind separation\nof potentially dependent/correlated sources. Differing from previous work, we\nassume some general geometric, not statistical, conditions on the source\nvectors allowing separation of potentially dependent/correlated sources.\nConcretely, we assume that the source vectors are sufficiently scattered in\ntheir domains which can be described by certain polytopes. Then, we consider\nrecovery of these sources by the Det-Max criterion, which maximizes the\ndeterminant of the output correlation matrix to enforce a similar spread for\nthe source estimates. Starting from this normative principle, and using a\nweighted similarity matching approach that enables arbitrary linear\ntransformations adaptable by local learning rules, we derive two-layer\nbiologically-plausible neural network algorithms that can separate mixtures\ninto sources coming from a variety of source domains.

    "abstract": "Coarse graining (CG) enables the investigation of molecular properties for\nlarger systems and at longer timescales than the ones attainable at the\natomistic resolution. Machine learning techniques have been recently proposed\nto learn CG particle interactions, i.e. develop CG force fields. Graph\nrepresentations of molecules and supervised training of a graph convolutional\nneural network architecture are used to learn the potential of mean force\nthrough a force matching scheme. In this work, the force acting on each CG\nparticle is correlated to a learned representation of its local environment\nthat goes under the name of SchNet, constructed via continuous filter\nconvolutions. We explore the application of SchNet models to obtain a CG\npotential for liquid benzene, investigating the effect of model architecture\nand hyperparameters on the thermodynamic, dynamical, and structural properties\nof the simulated CG systems, reporting and discussing challenges encountered\nand future directions envisioned.",

    "abstract": "Pandemics, in addition to affecting the health of populations, can have huge\nimpacts on their social and economic behavior. These factors, on the other\nhand, have the potential to feed back to and influence the disease spreading.\nIt is important to systematically study these interrelations, to determine\nwhich ones have significant effects, and whether the effects are adverse or\nbeneficial. Our recently developed epidemic model with agent-based and\ngeographical elements is used in this study for such a purpose. We perform an\nextensive parameter space exploration of the socio-economic part of the model,\nincluding factors like the attitudes (called values) of the agents towards the\ndisease spreading, health, economic situation, and regulations by government\nagents. We search for prominent patterns from the resulting simulated data\nusing basic classification tools, namely self-organizing maps and principal\ncomponent analysis. We seek to isolate the most important value parameters of\nthe population and government agents influencing the disease spreading speed\nand patterns, and monitor different quantities of the model output, such as\ninfection rates, the propagation speed of the epidemic, economic activity,\ngovernment regulations, and the compliance of population. Out of these, the\nones describing the epidemic spreading were resulting in the most distinctive\nclustering of the data, and they were selected as the basis of the remaining\nanalysis. We relate the found clusters to three distinct types of disease\nspreading: wave-like, chaotic, and transitional spreading patterns. The most\nimportant value parameter contributing to phase changes between these phases\nwas found to be the compliance of the population agents towards the government\nregulations.",

    "abstract": "The prediction of protein-ligand binding affinity is of great significance\nfor discovering lead compounds in drug research. Facing this challenging task,\nmost existing prediction methods rely on the topological and/or spatial\nstructure of molecules and the local interactions while ignoring the\nmulti-level inter-molecular interactions between proteins and ligands, which\noften lead to sub-optimal performance. To solve this issue, we propose a novel\nglobal-local interaction (GLI) framework to predict protein-ligand binding\naffinity. In particular, our GLI framework considers the inter-molecular\ninteractions between proteins and ligands, which involve not only the\nhigh-energy short-range interactions between closed atoms but also the\nlow-energy long-range interactions between non-bonded atoms. For each pair of\nprotein and ligand, our GLI embeds the long-range interactions globally and\naggregates local short-range interactions, respectively. Such a joint\nglobal-local interaction modeling strategy helps to improve prediction\naccuracy, and the whole framework is compatible with various neural\nnetwork-based modules. Experiments demonstrate that our GLI framework\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods with simple neural network architectures\nand moderate computational costs.",

The development of the parallel EELS instrument and\nfast, sensitive detectors have greatly improved the acquisition speed of EELS\nspectra. However, the traditional way of core-loss edge recognition is\nexperience based and human labor dependent, which limits the processing speed.\nSo far, the low signal-noise ratio and the low jump ratio of the core-loss\nedges on the raw EELS spectra have been challenging for the automation of edge\nrecognition. In this work, a convolutional-bidirectional long short-term memory\nneural network (CNN-BiLSTM) is proposed to automate the detection and elemental\nidentification of core-loss edges from raw spectra. An EELS spectral database\nis synthesized by using our forward model to assist in the training and\nvalidation of the neural network. To make the synthesized spectra resemble the\nreal spectra, we collected a large library of experimentally acquired EELS core\nedges. In synthesize the training library, the edges are modeled by fitting the\nmulti-gaussian model to the real edges from experiments, and the noise and\ninstrumental imperfectness are simulated and added. The well-trained CNN-BiLSTM\nnetwork is tested against both the simulated spectra and real spectra collected\nfrom experiments. The high accuracy of the network, 94.9 %, proves that,\nwithout complicated preprocessing of the raw spectra, the proposed CNN-BiLSTM\nnetwork achieves the automation of core-loss edge recognition for EELS spectra\nwith high accuracy.",

To increase its real world\napplicability, numerous models have also been proposed to restore SR images\nwith arbitrary scale factors, including asymmetric ones where images are\nresized to different scales along horizontal and vertical directions. Though\nmost models are only optimized for the unidirectional upscaling task while\nassuming a predefined downscaling kernel for low-resolution (LR) inputs, recent\nmodels based on Invertible Neural Networks (INN) are able to increase upscaling\naccuracy significantly by optimizing the downscaling and upscaling cycle\njointly.

Secure\nsoftware leasing has a mechanism that verifies whether a returned software is\nvalid or not. The security notion guarantees that once a user returns a\nsoftware in a valid form, the user no longer uses the software.\nIn this work, we introduce the notion of secret-key functional encryption\n(SKFE) with secure key leasing, where a decryption key can be securely leased\nin the sense of secure software leasing. We also instantiate it with standard\ncryptographic assumptions. More specifically, our contribution is as follows.\n- We define the syntax and security definitions for SKFE with secure key\nleasing.\n- We achieve a transformation from standard SKFE into SKFE with secure key\nleasing without using additional assumptions. Especially, we obtain bounded\ncollusion-resistant SKFE for P/poly with secure key leasing based on\npost-quantum one-way functions since we can instantiate bounded\ncollusion-resistant SKFE for P/poly with the assumption.\nSome previous secure software leasing schemes capture only pirate software\nthat runs on an honest evaluation algorithm (on a legitimate platform).\nHowever, our secure key leasing notion captures arbitrary attack strategies and\ndoes not have such a limitation.\nWe also introduce the notion of single-decryptor FE (SDFE), where each\nfunctional decryption key is copy-protected. Since copy-protection is a\nstronger primitive than secure software leasing, this notion can be seen as a\nstronger cryptographic primitive than FE with secure key leasing.

In\nbreast cancer, the index is even routinely checked in many patients. Currently,\npathologists use the immunohistochemistry method to calculate the percentage of\nKi-67 positive malignant cells as Ki-67 index. The higher score usually means\nmore aggressive tumor behavior. In clinical practice, the measurement of Ki-67\nindex relies on visual identifying method and manual counting. However, visual\nand manual assessment method is timeconsuming and leads to poor reproducibility\nbecause of different scoring standards or limited tumor area under assessment.\nHere, we use digital image processing technics including image binarization and\nimage morphological operations to create a digital image analysis method to\ninterpretate Ki-67 index. Then, 10 breast cancer specimens are used as\nvalidation with high accuracy (correlation efficiency r = 0.95127).

In this new framework, we exploit a rate critic to predict a feasible\nset of actions.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of image reconstruction for\nregion-of-interest (ROI) computed tomography (CT). While model-based iterative\nmethods can be used for such a problem, their practicability is often limited\ndue to tedious parameterization and slow convergence. In addition, inadequate\nsolutions can be obtained when the retained priors do not perfectly fit the\nsolution space. Deep learning methods offer an alternative approach that is\nfast, leverages information from large data sets, and thus can reach high\nreconstruction quality. However, these methods usually rely on black boxes not\naccounting for the physics of the imaging system, and their lack of\ninterpretability is often deplored. At the crossroads of both methods, unfolded\ndeep learning techniques have been recently proposed. They incorporate the\nphysics of the model and iterative optimization algorithms into a neural\nnetwork design, leading to superior performance in various applications. This\npaper introduces a novel, unfolded deep learning approach called U-RDBFB\ndesigned for ROI CT reconstruction from limited data. Few-view truncated data\nare efficiently handled thanks to a robust non-convex data fidelity function\ncombined with sparsity-inducing regularization functions. Iterations of a block\ndual forward-backward (DBFB) algorithm, embedded in an iterative reweighted\nscheme, are then unrolled over a neural network architecture, allowing the\nlearning of various parameters in a supervised manner.

    "abstract": "The cubic regularization method (CR) is a popular algorithm for unconstrained\nnon-convex optimization. At each iteration, CR solves a cubically regularized\nquadratic problem, called the cubic regularization subproblem (CRS). One way to\nsolve the CRS relies on solving the secular equation, whose computational\nbottleneck lies in the computation of all eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix. In\nthis paper, we propose and analyze a novel CRS solver based on an approximate\nsecular equation, which requires only some of the Hessian eigenvalues and is\ntherefore much more efficient. Two approximate secular equations (ASEs) are\ndeveloped. For both ASEs, we first study the existence and uniqueness of their\nroots and then establish an upper bound on the gap between the root and that of\nthe standard secular equation. Such an upper bound can in turn be used to bound\nthe distance from the approximate CRS solution based ASEs to the true CRS\nsolution, thus offering a theoretical guarantee for our CRS solver. A desirable\nfeature of our CRS solver is that it requires only matrix-vector multiplication\nbut not matrix inversion, which makes it particularly suitable for\nhigh-dimensional applications of unconstrained non-convex optimization, such as\nlow-rank recovery and deep learning. Numerical experiments with synthetic and\nreal data-sets are conducted to investigate the practical performance of the\nproposed CRS solver.

The murmur grade, a quantitative measure of the murmur\nintensity, is strongly correlated with the patient's clinical condition. This\nwork aims to estimate each patient's murmur grade (i.e., absent, soft, loud)\nfrom multiple auscultation location phonocardiograms (PCGs) of a large\npopulation of pediatric patients from a low-resource rural area. Methods: The\nMel spectrogram representation of each PCG recording is given to an ensemble of\n15 convolutional residual neural networks with channel-wise attention\nmechanisms to classify each PCG recording. The final murmur grade for each\npatient is derived based on the proposed decision rule and considering all\nestimated labels for available recordings. The proposed method is\ncross-validated on a dataset consisting of 3456 PCG recordings from 1007\npatients using a stratified ten-fold cross-validation. Additionally, the method\nwas tested on a hidden test set comprised of 1538 PCG recordings from 442\npatients. Results: The overall cross-validation performances for patient-level\nmurmur gradings are 86.3% and 81.6% in terms of the unweighted average of\nsensitivities and F1-scores, respectively. The sensitivities (and F1-scores)\nfor absent, soft, and loud murmurs are 90.7% (93.6%), 75.8% (66.8%), and 92.3%\n(84.2%), respectively.

    "abstract": "Pathologists diagnose and grade prostate cancer by examining tissue from\nneedle biopsies on glass slides. The cancer's severity and risk of metastasis\nare determined by the Gleason grade, a score based on the organization and\nmorphology of prostate cancer glands. For diagnostic work-up, pathologists\nfirst locate glands in the whole biopsy core, and -- if they detect cancer --\nthey assign a Gleason grade. This time-consuming process is subject to errors\nand significant inter-observer variability, despite strict diagnostic criteria.\nThis paper proposes an automated workflow that follows pathologists'\n\\textit{modus operandi}, isolating and classifying multi-scale patches of\nindividual glands in whole slide images (WSI) of biopsy tissues using distinct\nsteps: (1) two fully convolutional networks segment epithelium versus stroma\nand gland boundaries, respectively; (2) a classifier network separates benign\nfrom cancer glands at high magnification; and (3) an additional classifier\npredicts the grade of each cancer gland at low magnification. Altogether, this\nprocess provides a gland-specific approach for prostate cancer grading that we\ncompare against other machine-learning-based grading methods.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we are interested in the acceleration of numerical\nsimulations. We focus on a hypersonic planetary reentry problem whose\nsimulation involves coupling fluid dynamics and chemical reactions. Simulating\nchemical reactions takes most of the computational time but, on the other hand,\ncannot be avoided to obtain accurate predictions. We face a trade-off between\ncost-efficiency and accuracy: the simulation code has to be sufficiently\nefficient to be used in an operational context but accurate enough to predict\nthe phenomenon faithfully. To tackle this trade-off, we design a hybrid\nsimulation code coupling a traditional fluid dynamic solver with a neural\nnetwork approximating the chemical reactions. We rely on their power in terms\nof accuracy and dimension reduction when applied in a big data context and on\ntheir efficiency stemming from their matrix-vector structure to achieve\nimportant acceleration factors ($\\times 10$ to $\\times 18.6$). This paper aims\nto explain how we design such cost-effective hybrid simulation codes in\npractice.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks trained end-to-end to map a measurement of a (noisy)\nimage to a clean image perform excellent for a variety of linear inverse\nproblems. Current methods are only trained on a few hundreds or thousands of\nimages as opposed to the millions of examples deep networks are trained on in\nother domains. In this work, we study whether major performance gains are\nexpected from scaling up the training set size. We consider image denoising,\naccelerated magnetic resonance imaging, and super-resolution and empirically\ndetermine the reconstruction quality as a function of training set size, while\noptimally scaling the network size. For all three tasks we find that an\ninitially steep power-law scaling slows significantly already at moderate\ntraining set sizes. Interpolating those scaling laws suggests that even\ntraining on millions of images would not significantly improve performance. To\nunderstand the expected behavior, we analytically characterize the performance\nof a linear estimator learned with early stopped gradient descent.

    "abstract": "Several notions of code products are known in quantum error correction, such\nas hyper-graph products, homological products, lifted products, balanced\nproducts, to name a few. In this paper we introduce a new product code\nconstruction which is a natural generalisation of classical product codes to\nquantum codes: starting from a set of component Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS)\ncodes, a larger CSS code is obtained where both $X$ parity checks and $Z$\nparity checks are associated to classical product codes. We deduce several\nproperties of product CSS codes from the properties of the component codes,\nincluding bounds on the code distance, and show that built-in redundancies in\nthe parity checks result in so-called meta-checks which can be exploited to\ncorrect syndrome read-out errors. We then specialise to the case of\nsingle-parity-check (SPC) product codes which in the classical domain are a\ncommon choice for constructing product codes. Logical error rate simulations of\na SPC $3$-fold product CSS code having parameters $[[512,174,8]]$ are shown\nunder both a maximum likelihood decoder for the erasure channel and belief\npropagation decoding for depolarising noise.

    "abstract": "Recent studies on contrastive learning have achieved remarkable performance\nsolely by leveraging few labels in the context of medical image segmentation.\nExisting methods mainly focus on instance discrimination and invariant mapping.\nHowever, they face three common pitfalls: (1) tailness: medical image data\nusually follows an implicit long-tail class distribution. Blindly leveraging\nall pixels in training hence can lead to the data imbalance issues, and cause\ndeteriorated performance; (2) consistency: it remains unclear whether a\nsegmentation model has learned meaningful and yet consistent anatomical\nfeatures due to the intra-class variations between different anatomical\nfeatures; and (3) diversity: the intra-slice correlations within the entire\ndataset have received significantly less attention. This motivates us to seek a\nprincipled approach for strategically making use of the dataset itself to\ndiscover similar yet distinct samples from different anatomical views. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel semi-supervised medical image segmentation\nframework termed Mine yOur owN Anatomy (MONA), and make three contributions.\nFirst, prior work argues that every pixel equally matters to the model\ntraining; we observe empirically that this alone is unlikely to define\nmeaningful anatomical features, mainly due to lacking the supervision signal.\nWe show two simple solutions towards learning invariances - through the use of\nstronger data augmentations and nearest neighbors. Second, we construct a set\nof objectives that encourage the model to be capable of decomposing medical\nimages into a collection of anatomical features in an unsupervised manner.\nLastly, our extensive results on three benchmark datasets with different\nlabeled settings validate the effectiveness of our proposed MONA which achieves\nnew state-of-the-art under different labeled settings.",

EPBs are known\ncauses of radio wave scintillations which can degrade communications with\nspacecraft. We build a random forest regressor to predict and forecast the\nprobability of an EPB [0-1] detected by the IBI processor on-board the SWARM\nspacecraft. We use 8-years of Swarm data from 2014 to 2021 and transform the\ndata from a time series into a 5 dimensional space consisting of latitude,\nlongitude, mlt, year, and day-of-the-year. We also add Kp, F10.7cm and solar\nwind speed. The observations of EPBs with respect to geolocation, local time,\nseason and solar activity mostly agrees with existing work, whilst the link\ngeomagnetic activity is less clear. The prediction has an accuracy of 88% and\nperforms well across the EPB specific spatiotemporal scales. This proves that\nthe XGBoost method is able to successfully capture the climatological and daily\nvariability of SWARM EPBs. Capturing the daily variance has long evaded\nresearchers because of local and stochastic features within the ionosphere. We\ntake advantage of Shapley Values to explain the model and to gain insight into\nthe physics of EPBs. We find that as the solar wind speed increases the\nprobability of an EPB decreases.

Estimating a CBT from a population where brain graphs are derived\nfrom diverse neuroimaging modalities (e.g., functional and structural) and at\ndifferent resolutions (i.e., number of nodes) remains a formidable challenge to\nsolve. Such network integration task allows for learning a rich and universal\nrepresentation of the brain connectivity across varying modalities and\nresolutions.

Therefore, for applications where\nthe number of supports is relatively small compared with the dimension, e.g.,\nseveral deep learning applications where the mini-batch approaches are\nutilized, the complexities from matrix multiplication of Radon Transform become\nthe main computational bottleneck. To address this issue, we propose to derive\nprojections by linearly and randomly combining a smaller number of projections\nwhich are named bottleneck projections. We explain the usage of these\nprojections by introducing Hierarchical Radon Transform (HRT) which is\nconstructed by applying Radon Transform variants recursively. We then formulate\nthe approach into a new metric between measures, named Hierarchical Sliced\nWasserstein (HSW) distance. By proving the injectivity of HRT, we derive the\nmetricity of HSW. Moreover, we investigate the theoretical properties of HSW\nincluding its connection to SW variants and its computational and sample\ncomplexities. Finally, we compare the computational cost and generative quality\nof HSW with the conventional SW on the task of deep generative modeling using\nvarious benchmark datasets including CIFAR10, CelebA, and Tiny ImageNet.",

    "abstract": "Blind source separation (BSS) algorithms are unsupervised methods, which are\nthe cornerstone of hyperspectral data analysis by allowing for physically\nmeaningful data decompositions. BSS problems being ill-posed, the resolution\nrequires efficient regularization schemes to better distinguish between the\nsources and yield interpretable solutions. For that purpose, we investigate a\nsemi-supervised source separation approach in which we combine a projected\nalternating least-square algorithm with a learning-based regularization scheme.\nIn this article, we focus on constraining the mixing matrix to belong to a\nlearned manifold by making use of generative models. Altogether, we show that\nthis allows for an innovative BSS algorithm, with improved accuracy, which\nprovides physically interpretable solutions. The proposed method, coined sGMCA,\nis tested on realistic hyperspectral astrophysical data in challenging\nscenarios involving strong noise, highly correlated spectra and unbalanced\nsources. The results highlight the significant benefit of the learned prior to\nreduce the leakages between the sources, which allows an overall better\ndisentanglement.",
