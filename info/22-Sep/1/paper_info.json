    "abstract": "Benefiting from the search efficiency, differentiable neural architecture\nsearch (NAS) has evolved as the most dominant alternative to automatically\ndesign competitive deep neural networks (DNNs). We note that DNNs must be\nexecuted under strictly hard performance constraints in real-world scenarios,\nfor example, the runtime latency on autonomous vehicles. However, to obtain the\narchitecture that meets the given performance constraint, previous\nhardware-aware differentiable NAS methods have to repeat a plethora of search\nruns to manually tune the hyper-parameters by trial and error, and thus the\ntotal design cost increases proportionally. To resolve this, we introduce a\nlightweight hardware-aware differentiable NAS framework dubbed LightNAS,\nstriving to find the required architecture that satisfies various performance\nconstraints through a one-time search (i.e., \\underline{\\textit{you only search\nonce}}). Extensive experiments are conducted to show the superiority of\nLightNAS over previous state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "The research of extending deep reinforcement learning (drl) to multi-agent\nfield has solved many complicated problems and made great achievements.\nHowever, almost all these studies only focus on discrete or continuous action\nspace and there are few works having ever used multi-agent deep reinforcement\nlearning to real-world environment problems which mostly have a hybrid action\nspace. Therefore, in this paper, we propose two algorithms: deep multi-agent\nhybrid soft actor-critic (MAHSAC) and multi-agent hybrid deep deterministic\npolicy gradients (MAHDDPG) to fill this gap. This two algorithms follow the\ncentralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm and could\nhandle hybrid action space problems. Our experiences are running on multi-agent\nparticle environment which is an easy multi-agent particle world, along with\nsome basic simulated physics. The experimental results show that these\nalgorithms have good performances.",

    "abstract": "Multi-view data are commonly encountered in data mining applications.\nEffective extraction of information from multi-view data requires specific\ndesign of clustering methods to cater for data with multiple views, which is\nnon-trivial and challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel one-step\nmulti-view clustering method by exploiting the dual representation of both the\ncommon and specific information of different views. The motivation originates\nfrom the rationale that multi-view data contain not only the consistent\nknowledge between views but also the unique knowledge of each view. Meanwhile,\nto make the representation learning more specific to the clustering task, a\none-step learning framework is proposed to integrate representation learning\nand clustering partition as a whole. With this framework, the representation\nlearning and clustering partition mutually benefit each other, which\neffectively improve the clustering performance. Results from extensive\nexperiments conducted on benchmark multi-view datasets clearly demonstrate the\nsuperiority of the proposed method.",

At its heart is an automatic differentiation\nsubroutine built upon analytical expressions of scattering matrices, which\nenables gradient descent optimization for functional circuit synthesis. As\ndemonstrated in numerical results, the advantages of our method include: (i)\ngradients are calculated analytically instead of using numerical\ndifferentiation, making the high-dimensional optimization solvable in time\nscales of minutes; and (ii) our method is suited to a wide range of light\nprocessing functions, and can synthesize multiple functions on the same PPIC\nsimultaneously.",

    "abstract": "Active Flux is a recently developed numerical method for hyperbolic\nconservation laws. Its classical degrees of freedom are cell averages and point\nvalues at cell interfaces. These latter are shared between adjacent cells,\nleading to a globally continuous reconstruction. The update of the point values\nincludes upwinding, but without solving a Riemann Problem. The update of the\ncell average requires a flux quadrature at the cell interface, which can be\nimmediately performed using the point values. This paper explores different\nextensions of Active Flux to arbitrarily high order of accuracy, while\nmaintaining the idea of global continuity. We propose to either increase the\nstencil while keeping the same degrees of freedom, or to increase the number of\npoint values, or to include higher moments as new degrees of freedom.

    "abstract": "A well-known failure mode of neural networks corresponds to high confidence\nerroneous predictions, especially for data that somehow differs from the\ntraining distribution. Such an unsafe behaviour limits their applicability. To\ncounter that, we show that models offering accurate confidence levels can be\ndefined via adding constraints in their internal representations. That is, we\nencode class labels as fixed unique binary vectors, or class codes, and use\nthose to enforce class-dependent activation patterns throughout the model.\nResulting predictors are dubbed Total Activation Classifiers (TAC), and TAC is\nused as an additional component to a base classifier to indicate how reliable a\nprediction is. Given a data instance, TAC slices intermediate representations\ninto disjoint sets and reduces such slices into scalars, yielding activation\nprofiles. During training, activation profiles are pushed towards the code\nassigned to a given training instance. At testing time, one can predict the\nclass corresponding to the code that best matches the activation profile of an\nexample. Empirically, we observe that the resemblance between activation\npatterns and their corresponding codes results in an inexpensive unsupervised\napproach for inducing discriminative confidence scores. Namely, we show that\nTAC is at least as good as state-of-the-art confidence scores extracted from\nexisting models, while strictly improving the model's value on the rejection\nsetting.

Further, the technique learns a model that\nis accurate enough to induce near-optimal policies given significantly fewer\ntrajectories than those required by model-free algorithms. It brings the\nbenefits of model-based RL without requiring a model to be developed in\nadvance, for systems that have physics-based dynamics.\nTo establish the validity and applicability of this algorithm, we conduct\nexperiments on four classic control tasks. We found that an optimal policy\ntrained on the discovered dynamics of the underlying system can generalize\nwell. Further, the learned policy performs well when deployed on the actual\nphysical system, thus bridging the model to real system gap.

Recently, there has been a\nconcerted effort to formally define emergence using the mathematical framework\nof information theory, which proposes that emergence can be understood in terms\nof how the states of wholes and parts collectively disclose information about\nthe system's collective future. In this paper, we show how a common,\nfoundational component of information-theoretic approaches to emergence implies\nan inherent instability to emergent properties, which we call flickering\nemergence. A system may on average display a meaningful emergent property (be\nit an informative coarse-graining, or higher-order synergy), but for particular\nconfigurations, that emergent property falls apart and becomes misinformative.\nWe show existence proofs that flickering emergence occurs in two different\nframeworks (one based on coarse-graining and another based on multivariate\ninformation decomposition) and argue that any approach based on temporal mutual\ninformation will display it. Finally, we argue that flickering emergence should\nnot be a disqualifying property of any model of emergence, but that it should\nbe accounted for when attempting to theorize about how emergence relates to\npractical models of the natural world.",

    "abstract": "Considering the prospects of public key embedding (PKE) mechanism in active\nforensics on the integrity or identity of ciphertext for distributed deep\nlearning security, two reversible data hiding in encrypted domain (RDH-ED)\nalgorithms with PKE mechanism are proposed, in which all the elements of the\nembedding function shall be open to the public, while the extraction function\ncould be performed only by legitimate users. The first algorithm is difference\nexpansion in single bit encrypted domain (DE-SBED), which is optimized from the\nhomomorphic embedding framework based on the bit operations of DE in spatial\ndomain. DE-SBED is suitable for the ciphertext of images encrypted from any\nsingle bit encryption and learning with errors (LWE) encryption is selected in\nthis paper. Pixel value ordering is introduced to reduce the distortion of\ndecryption and improve the embedding rates (ER). To apply to more flexible\napplications, public key recoding on encryption redundancy (PKR-ER) algorithm\nis proposed. Public embedding key is constructed by recoding on the redundancy\nfrom the probabilistic decryption of LWE. It is suitable for any plaintext\nregardless of the type of medium or the content. By setting different\nquantization rules for recoding, decryption and extraction functions are\nseparable. No distortion exists in the directly decrypted results of the marked\nciphertext and ER could reach over 1.0 bits per bit of plaintext.

However, it leads to an interference among the cells,\nespecially at the cell edges where the probability for a cell-edge user to be\nscheduled on a resource block that is being transmitted by the neighbouring\ncell is high; consequently, the interference is high. In-order to mitigate\nInter-Cell Interference, Inter-Cell Interference Coordination was proposed by\nthe Third Generation Partnership Project 3GPP standards for the LTE network,\nand later on, the enhanced Inter-Cell Interference Coordination was proposed\nfor the LTE-Advanced Heterogeneous Network deployments. Another technique that\nwas proposed by the 3GPP for the LTE-Advanced network that can reduce the\nInter-Cell Interference and improve the cell-average and cell-edge user\nthroughput is the Coordinated Multi-Point transmission and reception technique,\nin which it can increase the cell-average and cell-edge user throughput in both\nthe uplink and downlink transmission by joint scheduling and data processing in\nmultiple cells. Another technique that was proposed by the 3GPP for the\nLTE-Advanced network that can improve the LTE network coverage in difficult\nconditions is to deploy Relay Nodes and Back-Hauls. In this paper, we survey\nthe Radio Resource Management of these techniques that are used with\nLTE-Advanced. We start by explaining the concepts of these techniques.

Most\nexisting directed greybox fuzzers do not provide any theoretical analysis of\ntheir performance or optimality.\nIn this paper, we introduce a complexity-theoretic framework to pose directed\ngreybox fuzzing as a oracle-guided search problem where some feedback about the\ninput space (e.g., how close an input is to the target sites) is received by\nquerying an oracle. Our framework assumes that each oracle query can return\narbitrary content with a large but constant amount of information. Therefore,\nwe use the number of oracle queries required by a fuzzing algorithm to find a\ntarget-reaching input as the performance metric. Using our framework, we design\na randomized directed greybox fuzzing algorithm that makes a logarithmic (wrt.\nthe number of all possible inputs) number of queries in expectation to find a\ntarget-reaching input. We further prove that the number of oracle queries\nrequired by our algorithm is optimal, i.e., no fuzzing algorithm can improve\n(i.e., minimize) the query count by more than a constant factor.\nWe implement our approach in MC$^2$ and outperform state-of-the-art directed\ngreybox fuzzers on challenging benchmarks (Magma and Fuzzer Test Suite) by up\nto two orders of magnitude (i.e., $134\\times$) on average.

    "abstract": "Weakly supervised video object localization (WSVOL) allows locating object in\nvideos using only global video tags such as object class. State-of-art methods\nrely on multiple independent stages, where initial spatio-temporal proposals\nare generated using visual and motion cues, then prominent objects are\nidentified and refined. Localization is done by solving an optimization problem\nover one or more videos, and video tags are typically used for video\nclustering. This requires a model per-video or per-class making for costly\ninference. Moreover, localized regions are not necessary discriminant because\nof unsupervised motion methods like optical flow, or because video tags are\ndiscarded from optimization. In this paper, we leverage the successful class\nactivation mapping (CAM) methods, designed for WSOL based on still images. A\nnew Temporal CAM (TCAM) method is introduced to train a discriminant deep\nlearning (DL) model to exploit spatio-temporal information in videos, using an\naggregation mechanism, called CAM-Temporal Max Pooling (CAM-TMP), over\nconsecutive CAMs. In particular, activations of regions of interest (ROIs) are\ncollected from CAMs produced by a pretrained CNN classifier to build pixel-wise\npseudo-labels for training the DL model. In addition, a global unsupervised\nsize constraint, and local constraint such as CRF are used to yield more\naccurate CAMs. Inference over single independent frames allows parallel\nprocessing of a clip of frames, and real-time localization. Extensive\nexperiments on two challenging YouTube-Objects datasets for unconstrained\nvideos, indicate that CAM methods (trained on independent frames) can yield\ndecent localization accuracy. Our proposed TCAM method achieves a new\nstate-of-art in WSVOL accuracy, and visual results suggest that it can be\nadapted for subsequent tasks like visual object tracking and detection.

Unlike humans, artificial neural networks suffer from\ncatastrophic forgetting and may forget the previously visited areas when\ntrained with new arrivals. For humans, researchers discover that there exists a\nmemory replay mechanism in the brain to keep the neuron active for previous\nevents. Inspired by this discovery, BioSLAM designs a gated generative replay\nto control the robot's learning behavior based on the feedback rewards.\nSpecifically, BioSLAM provides a novel dual-memory mechanism for maintenance:\n1) a dynamic memory to efficiently learn new observations and 2) a static\nmemory to balance new-old knowledge.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce LINKS, a dataset of 100 million one degree of\nfreedom planar linkage mechanisms and 1.1 billion coupler curves, which is more\nthan 1000 times larger than any existing database of planar mechanisms and is\nnot limited to specific kinds of mechanisms such as four-bars, six-bars, \\etc\nwhich are typically what most databases include. LINKS is made up of various\ncomponents including 100 million mechanisms, the simulation data for each\nmechanism, normalized paths generated by each mechanism, a curated set of\npaths, the code used to generate the data and simulate mechanisms, and a live\nweb demo for interactive design of linkage mechanisms. The curated paths are\nprovided as a measure for removing biases in the paths generated by mechanisms\nthat enable a more even design space representation. In this paper, we discuss\nthe details of how we can generate such a large dataset and how we can overcome\nmajor issues with such scales. To be able to generate such a large dataset we\nintroduce a new operator to generate 1-DOF mechanism topologies, furthermore,\nwe take many steps to speed up slow simulations of mechanisms by vectorizing\nour simulations and parallelizing our simulator on a large number of threads,\nwhich leads to a simulation 800 times faster than the simple simulation\nalgorithm. This is necessary given on average, 1 out of 500 candidates that are\ngenerated are valid~(and all must be simulated to determine their validity),\nwhich means billions of simulations must be performed for the generation of\nthis dataset. Then we demonstrate the depth of our dataset through a\nbi-directional chamfer distance-based shape retrieval study where we show how\nour dataset can be used directly to find mechanisms that can trace paths very\nclose to desired target paths.",

    "abstract": "In coding theory, constructing codes with good parameters is one of the most\nimportant and fundamental problems. Though a great many of good codes have been\nproduced, most of them are defined over alphabets of sizes equal to prime\npowers. In this paper, we provide a new explicit construction of $(q+1)$-ary\nnonlinear codes via algebraic function fields, where $q$ is a prime power. Our\ncodes are constructed by evaluations of rational functions at all rational\nplaces of the algebraic function field. Compared with algebraic geometry codes,\nthe main difference is that we allow rational functions to be evaluated at pole\nplaces. After evaluating rational functions from a union of Riemann-Roch\nspaces, we obtain a family of nonlinear codes over the alphabet\n$\\mathbb{F}_{q}\\cup \\{\\infty\\}$. It turns out that our codes have better\nparameters than those obtained from MDS codes or good algebraic geometry codes\nvia code alphabet extension and restriction.",

    "abstract": "Recovering underlying Directed Acyclic Graph structures (DAG) from\nobservational data is highly challenging due to the combinatorial nature of the\nDAG-constrained optimization problem. Recently, DAG learning has been cast as a\ncontinuous optimization problem by characterizing the DAG constraint as a\nsmooth equality one, generally based on polynomials over adjacency matrices.\nExisting methods place very small coefficients on high-order polynomial terms\nfor stabilization, since they argue that large coefficients on the higher-order\nterms are harmful due to numeric exploding. On the contrary, we discover that\nlarge coefficients on higher-order terms are beneficial for DAG learning, when\nthe spectral radiuses of the adjacency matrices are small, and that larger\ncoefficients for higher-order terms can approximate the DAG constraints much\nbetter than the small counterparts. Based on this, we propose a novel DAG\nlearning method with efficient truncated matrix power iteration to approximate\ngeometric series-based DAG constraints. Empirically, our DAG learning method\noutperforms the previous state-of-the-arts in various settings, often by a\nfactor of 3 or more in terms of structural Hamming distance.",

    "abstract": "In one-class recommendation systems, the goal is to learn a model from a\nsmall set of interacted users and items and then identify the\npositively-related user-item pairs among a large number of pairs with unknown\ninteractions. Most previous loss functions rely on dissimilar pairs of users\nand items, which are selected from the ones with unknown interactions, to\nobtain better prediction performance. This strategy introduces several\nchallenges such as increasing training time and hurting the performance by\npicking \"similar pairs with the unknown interactions\" as dissimilar pairs. In\nthis paper, the goal is to only use the similar set to train the models. We\npoint out three trivial solutions that the models converge to when they are\ntrained only on similar pairs: collapsed, partially collapsed, and shrinking\nsolutions. We propose two terms that can be added to the objective functions in\nthe literature to avoid these solutions. The first one is a hinge pairwise\ndistance loss that avoids the shrinking and collapsed solutions by keeping the\naverage pairwise distance of all the representations greater than a margin. The\nsecond one is an orthogonality term that minimizes the correlation between the\ndimensions of the representations and avoids the partially collapsed solution.\nWe conduct experiments on a variety of tasks on public and real-world datasets.\nThe results show that our approach using only similar pairs outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods using similar pairs and a large number of dissimilar\npairs.",

To address the above limitations, we propose the Structure Information\nModeling Transformer (SIM-Trans) to incorporate object structure information\ninto transformer for enhancing discriminative representation learning to\ncontain both the appearance information and structure information.\nSpecifically, we encode the image into a sequence of patch tokens and build a\nstrong vision transformer framework with two well-designed modules: (i) the\nstructure information learning (SIL) module is proposed to mine the spatial\ncontext relation of significant patches within the object extent with the help\nof the transformer's self-attention weights, which is further injected into the\nmodel for importing structure information; (ii) the multi-level feature\nboosting (MFB) module is introduced to exploit the complementary of multi-level\nfeatures and contrastive learning among classes to enhance feature robustness\nfor accurate recognition. The proposed two modules are light-weighted and can\nbe plugged into any transformer network and trained end-to-end easily, which\nonly depends on the attention weights that come with the vision transformer\nitself. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that the proposed\nSIM-Trans achieves state-of-the-art performance on fine-grained visual\ncategorization benchmarks.

We use a combination of static\ncode analysis and human annotators to assess code readability, and we use eye\ntracking to assess the visual inspection of code.\nResults: Our results suggest that model generated code is comparable in\ncomplexity and readability to code written by human pair programmers. At the\nsame time, eye tracking data suggests, to a statistically significant level,\nthat programmers direct less visual attention to model generated code.\nConclusion: Our findings highlight that reading code is more important than\never, and programmers should beware of complacency and automation bias with\nmodel generated code.",

The existing CRS solutions\nare widely dominated by deep reinforcement learning algorithms. However, deep\nreinforcement learning methods are often criticised for lacking\ninterpretability and requiring a large amount of training data to perform.\nIn this paper, we explore a simpler alternative and propose a decision tree\nbased solution to CRS. The underlying challenge in CRS is that the same item\ncan be described differently by different users. We show that decision trees\nare sufficient to characterize the interactions between users and items, and\nsolve the key challenges in multi-turn CRS: namely which questions to ask, how\nto rank the candidate items, when to recommend, and how to handle negative\nfeedback on the recommendations. Firstly, the training of decision trees\nenables us to find questions which effectively narrow down the search space.\nSecondly, by learning embeddings for each item and tree nodes, the candidate\nitems can be ranked based on their similarity to the conversation context\nencoded by the tree nodes. Thirdly, the diversity of items associated with each\ntree node allows us to develop an early stopping strategy to decide when to\nmake recommendations. Fourthly, when the user rejects a recommendation, we\nadaptively choose the next decision tree to improve subsequent questions and\nrecommendations.

They are widely used by machine\nlearning practitioners as a measure of an algorithm's performance, but classic\nPAC learning theory cannot explain their behavior. In this paper we introduce a\nnew combinatorial characterization called the VCL dimension that improves and\nrefines the recent results of Bousquet et al. (2021). Our characterization\nsheds new light on the structure of learning curves by providing fine-grained\nbounds, and showing that for classes with finite VCL, the rate of decay can be\ndecomposed into a linear component that depends only on the hypothesis class\nand an exponential component that depends also on the target distribution. In\nparticular, the finer nuance of the VCL dimension implies lower bounds that are\nquantitatively stronger than the bounds of Bousquet et al. (2021) and\nqualitatively stronger than classic 'no free lunch' lower bounds. The VCL\ncharacterization solves an open problem studied by Antos and Lugosi (1998), who\nasked in what cases such lower bounds exist. As a corollary, we recover their\nlower bound for half-spaces in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, and we do so in a principled way\nthat should be applicable to other cases as well. Finally, to provide another\nviewpoint on our work and how it compares to traditional PAC learning bounds,\nwe also present an alternative formulation of our results in a language that is\ncloser to the PAC setting.",

During message transmission, privacy-preserving\nauthentication is considered as the first line of defence against attackers and\nmalicious information. To achieve a more secure and stable communication\nenvironment, ever-increasing numbers of blockchain-based authentication schemes\nare proposed. At first glance, existing approaches provide robust architectures\nand achieve transparent authentication. However, in these schemes, verifiers\nmust connect to the blockchain network in advance and accomplish the\nauthentication with smart contracts, which prolongs the latency. To remedy this\nlimit, we propose a privacy-preserving blockchain-based authentication\nprotocol(PBAG), where Root Authority(RA) generates a unique evaluation proof\ncorresponding to the issued certificate for each authorized vehicle. Meanwhile,\nRA broadcasts a public global commitment based on all valid certificates.\nInstead of querying certificates stored in the blockchain, the vehicle will be\nefficiently proved to be an authorized user by utilizing the global commitment\nthrough bilinear pairing. Moreover, our scheme can prevent vehicles equipped\nwith invalid certificates from accomplishing the authentication, thus avoiding\nthe time-consuming for checking Certificate Revocation List (CRL). Finally, our\nscheme provides privacy properties such as anonymity and unlinkability. It\nallows anonymous authentication based on evaluation proofs and achieves\ntraceability of identity in the event of a dispute. The simulation demonstrates\nthat the average time of verification is 0.36ms under the batch-enabled\nmechanism, outperforming existing schemes by at least 63.7%.",

    "abstract": "Although CLIP-like Visual Language Models provide a functional joint feature\nspace for image and text, due to the limitation of the CILP-like model's image\ninput size (e.g., 224), subtle details are lost in the feature representation\nif we input high-resolution images (e.g., 2240). In this work, we introduce an\nefficient framework that can produce a single feature representation for a\nhigh-resolution image that injects image details and shares the same semantic\nspace as the original CLIP. In the framework, we train a feature fusing model\nbased on CLIP features extracted from a carefully designed image patch method\nthat can cover objects of any scale, weakly supervised by image-agnostic class\nprompted queries. We validate our framework by retrieving images from class\nprompted queries on the real world and synthetic datasets, showing significant\nperformance improvement on these tasks. Furthermore, to fully demonstrate our\nframework's detail retrieval ability, we construct a CLEVR-like synthetic\ndataset called CLVER-DS, which is fully annotated and has a controllable object\nscale.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous driving systems (ADSs) must be tested thoroughly before they can\nbe deployed in autonomous vehicles. High-fidelity simulators allow them to be\ntested against diverse scenarios, including those that are difficult to\nrecreate in real-world testing grounds. While previous approaches have shown\nthat test cases can be generated automatically, they tend to focus on weak\noracles (e.g. reaching the destination without collisions) without assessing\nwhether the journey itself was undertaken safely and satisfied the law. In this\nwork, we propose LawBreaker, an automated framework for testing ADSs against\nreal-world traffic laws, which is designed to be compatible with different\nscenario description languages. LawBreaker provides a rich driver-oriented\nspecification language for describing traffic laws, and a fuzzing engine that\nsearches for different ways of violating them by maximising specification\ncoverage. To evaluate our approach, we implemented it for Apollo+LGSVL and\nspecified the traffic laws of China. LawBreaker was able to find 14 violations\nof these laws, including 173 test cases that caused accidents.",

    "abstract": "Image retrieval systems help users to browse and search among extensive\nimages in real-time. With the rise of cloud computing, retrieval tasks are\nusually outsourced to cloud servers. However, the cloud scenario brings a\ndaunting challenge of privacy protection as cloud servers cannot be fully\ntrusted. To this end, image-encryption-based privacy-preserving image retrieval\nschemes have been developed, which first extract features from cipher-images,\nand then build retrieval models based on these features. Yet, most existing\napproaches extract shallow features and design trivial retrieval models,\nresulting in insufficient expressiveness for the cipher-images. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel paradigm named Encrypted Vision Transformer (EViT), which\nadvances the discriminative representations capability of cipher-images. First,\nin order to capture comprehensive ruled information, we extract multi-level\nlocal length sequence and global Huffman-code frequency features from the\ncipher-images which are encrypted by stream cipher during JPEG compression\nprocess. Second, we design the Vision Transformer-based retrieval model to\ncouple with the multi-level features, and propose two adaptive data\naugmentation methods to improve representation power of the retrieval model.\nOur proposal can be easily adapted to unsupervised and supervised settings via\nself-supervised contrastive learning manner. Extensive experiments reveal that\nEViT achieves both excellent encryption and retrieval performance,\noutperforming current schemes in terms of retrieval accuracy by large margins\nwhile protecting image privacy effectively.

Previous studies imply that mapping aids in\na live programming environment might support novices while programming and\nfoster a deeper understanding of the content. To implement these mapping aids\nin a domain independent way Source Location Tracking based on run-time\ninformation can be used. In our study, we tested N=82 participants while\ninteracting and learning in an online programming environment. Using our 2x2\nbetween-subject design study, we investigated the effects of two mapping aids:\nhighlighting and dynamic linking on coding correctness including typical\nerrors, and learning outcomes.

While highlights were more helpful for implementing the\nquadcopter missions, dynamic linking improved learning outcomes on the\ncomprehension and application level . Traces of learning strategies were\nrelated to higher coding correctness and higher learning outcomes.

For this reason, face image quality assessment (FIQA)\ntechniques aim to support FR systems, by providing them with sample quality\ninformation that can be used to reject poor quality data unsuitable for\nrecognition purposes. Several groups of FIQA methods relying on different\nconcepts have been proposed in the literature, all of which can be used for\ngenerating quality scores of facial images that can serve as pseudo\nground-truth (quality) labels and can be exploited for training\n(regression-based) quality estimation models.

Meta-learning aims to leverage experience gained\nfrom previous tasks to solve new tasks efficiently (i.e., with better\nperformance, little training data, and/or modest computational resources).\nWhile previous challenges in the series focused on within-domain few-shot\nlearning problems, with the aim of learning efficiently N-way k-shot tasks\n(i.e., N class classification problems with k training examples), this\ncompetition challenges the participants to solve \"any-way\" and \"any-shot\"\nproblems drawn from various domains (healthcare, ecology, biology,\nmanufacturing, and others), chosen for their humanitarian and societal impact.\nTo that end, we created Meta-Album, a meta-dataset of 40 image classification\ndatasets from 10 domains, from which we carve out tasks with any number of\n\"ways\" (within the range 2-20) and any number of \"shots\" (within the range\n1-20). The competition is with code submission, fully blind-tested on the\nCodaLab challenge platform. The code of the winners will be open-sourced,\nenabling the deployment of automated machine learning solutions for few-shot\nimage classification across several domains.",

    "title": "TRUST: An Accurate and End-to-End Table structure Recognizer Using  Splitting-based Transformers",
    "abstract": "Table structure recognition is a crucial part of document image analysis\ndomain. Its difficulty lies in the need to parse the physical coordinates and\nlogical indices of each cell at the same time. However, the existing methods\nare difficult to achieve both these goals, especially when the table splitting\nlines are blurred or tilted. In this paper, we propose an accurate and\nend-to-end transformer-based table structure recognition method, referred to as\nTRUST. Transformers are suitable for table structure recognition because of\ntheir global computations, perfect memory, and parallel computation. By\nintroducing novel Transformer-based Query-based Splitting Module and\nVertex-based Merging Module, the table structure recognition problem is\ndecoupled into two joint optimization sub-tasks: multi-oriented table\nrow/column splitting and table grid merging. The Query-based Splitting Module\nlearns strong context information from long dependencies via Transformer\nnetworks, accurately predicts the multi-oriented table row/column separators,\nand obtains the basic grids of the table accordingly. The Vertex-based Merging\nModule is capable of aggregating local contextual information between adjacent\nbasic grids, providing the ability to merge basic girds that belong to the same\nspanning cell accurately. We conduct experiments on several popular benchmarks\nincluding PubTabNet and SynthTable, our method achieves new state-of-the-art\nresults. In particular, TRUST runs at 10 FPS on PubTabNet, surpassing the\nprevious methods by a large margin.",

    "abstract": "While the Web of Data in principle offers access to a wide range of\ninterlinked data, the architecture of the Semantic Web today relies mostly on\nthe data providers to maintain access to their data through SPARQL endpoints.\nSeveral studies, however, have shown that such endpoints often experience\ndowntime, meaning that the data they maintain becomes inaccessible. While\ndecentralized systems based on Peer-to-Peer (P2P) technology have previously\nshown to increase the availability of knowledge graphs, even when a large\nproportion of the nodes fail, processing queries in such a setup can be an\nexpensive task since data necessary to answer a single query might be\ndistributed over multiple nodes. In this paper, we therefore propose an\napproach to optimizing SPARQL queries over decentralized knowledge graphs,\ncalled Lothbrok. While there are potentially many aspects to consider when\noptimizing such queries, we focus on three aspects: cardinality estimation,\nlocality awareness, and data fragmentation. We empirically show that Lothbrok\nis able to achieve significantly faster query processing performance compared\nto the state of the art when processing challenging queries as well as when the\nnetwork is under high load.",

    "title": "Evolving Microstructures in Relaxed Continuum Damage Mechanics for  Strain Softening",
    "abstract": "A new relaxation approach is proposed which allows for the description of\nstress- and strain-softening at finite strains. The model is based on the\nconstruction of a convex hull replacing the originally non-convex incremental\nstress potential which in turn represents damage in terms of the classical\n$(1-D)$ approach. This convex hull is given as the linear convex combination of\nweakly and strongly damaged phases and thus, it represents the homogenization\nof a microstructure bifurcated in the two phases. As a result thereof, damage\nevolves in the convexified regime mainly by an increasing volume fraction of\nthe strongly damaged phase. In contrast to previous relaxed incremental\nformulations in G\\\"urses and Miehe [16] and Balzani and Ortiz [2], where the\nconvex hull has been kept fixated after construction, here, the strongly\ndamaged phase is allowed to elastically unload upon further loading. At the\nsame time, its volume fraction increases nonlinearly within the convexified\nregime. Thus, strain-softening in the sense of a decreasing stress with\nincreasing strain can be modeled. The major advantage of the proposed approach\nis that it ensures mesh-independent structural simulations without the\nrequirement of additional length-scale related parameters or nonlocal\nquantities, which simplifies an implementation using classical material\nsubroutine interfaces. In this paper, focus is on the relaxation of\none-dimensional models for fiber damage which are combined with a microsphere\napproach to allow for the description of three-dimensional fiber dispersions\nappearing in fibrous materials such as soft biological tissues. Several\nnumerical examples are analyzed to show the overall response of the model and\nthe mesh-independence of resulting structural calculations.",

    "abstract": "We study the combinatorial assignment domain, which includes combinatorial\nauctions and course allocation. The main challenge in this domain is that the\nbundle space grows exponentially in the number of items. To address this,\nseveral papers have recently proposed machine learning-based preference\nelicitation algorithms that aim to elicit only the most important information\nfrom agents. However, the main shortcoming of this prior work is that it does\nnot model a mechanism's uncertainty over values for not yet elicited bundles.\nIn this paper, we address this shortcoming by presenting a Bayesian\nOptimization-based Combinatorial Assignment (BOCA) mechanism. Our key technical\ncontribution is to integrate a method for capturing model uncertainty into an\niterative combinatorial auction mechanism. Concretely, we design a new method\nfor estimating an upper uncertainty bound that can be used as an acquisition\nfunction to determine the next query to the agents. This enables the mechanism\nto properly explore (and not just exploit) the bundle space during its\npreference elicitation phase. We run computational experiments in several\nspectrum auction domains to evaluate BOCA's performance.

By combining multiple time this technique, we compute a\ndistance-$K$ coloring of the graph.

In radiative hydrodynamics applications, the\nradiative transfer needs to be solved implicitly because of the fast\npropagation speed of photons relative to the fluid velocity. The M1 model is\nhyperbolic and can be discretized with an HLL solver, whose time implicit\nintegration can be done using a nonlinear Jacobi method. One can show that this\niterative method always preserves the admissible states, such as positive\nradiative energy and reduced flux less than 1. To decrease the number of\niterations required for the solver to converge, and therefore to decrease the\ncomputational cost, we propose a geometric multigrid algorithm. Unfortunately,\nthis method is not able to preserve the admissible states. In order to preserve\nthe admissible state states, we introduce a pseudo-time such that the solution\nof the problem on the coarse grid is the steady state of a differential\nequation in pseudo-time. We present preliminary results showing the decrease of\nthe number of iterations and computational cost as a function of the number of\nmultigrid levels used in the method.

Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthe superiority and generalization ability of ELMformer. On SIDD benchmark, our\nmethod has even better denoising performance than ISP-based methods which need\nhuge amount of additional sRGB training images.

Then, it turns out that k+1 reversible counters are not\nbetter than k ordinary counters and vice versa. Finally, almost all usually\nstudied decidability questions turn out to be undecidable and not even\nsemidecidable for reversible multi-counter automata, if at least two counters\nare provided.",

    "abstract": "Watson-Crick (WK) finite automata are working on a Watson-Crick tape, that\nis, on a DNA molecule. A double stranded DNA molecule contains two strands,\neach having a 5' and a 3' end, and these two strands together form the molecule\nwith the following properties. The strands have the same length, their 5' to 3'\ndirections are opposite, and in each position, the two strands have nucleotides\nthat are complement of each other (by the Watson-Crick complementary relation).\nConsequently, WK automata have two reading heads, one for each strand. In\ntraditional WK automata both heads read the whole input in the same physical\ndirection, but in 5'->3' WK automata the heads start from the two extremes and\nread the input in opposite direction. In sensing 5'->3' WK automata, the\nprocess on the input is finished when the heads meet, and the model is capable\nto accept the class of linear context-free languages. Deterministic variants\nare weaker, the class named 2detLIN, a proper subclass of linear languages is\naccepted by them. Recently, another specific variants, the state-deterministic\nsensing 5'->3' WK automata are investigated in which the graph of the automaton\nhas the special property that for each node of the graph, all out edges (if\nany) go to a sole node, i.e., for each state there is (at most) one state that\ncan be reached by a direct transition. It was shown that this concept is\nsomewhat orthogonal to the usual concept of determinism in case of sensing\n5'->3' WK automata. In this paper a new concept, the quasi-determinism is\ninvestigated, that is in each configuration of a computation (if it is not\nfinished yet), the next state is uniquely determined although the next\nconfiguration may not be, in case various transitions are enabled at the same\ntime. We show that this new concept is a common generalisation of the usual\ndeterminism and the state-determinism, i.e., the class of quasi-deterministic\nsensing 5'->3' WK automata is a superclass of both of the mentioned other\nclasses. There are various usual restrictions on WK automata, e.g., stateless\nor 1-limited variants. We also prove some hierarchy results among language\nclasses accepted by various subclasses of quasi-deterministic sensing 5'->3' WK\nautomata and also some other already known language classes.",

With a sparse binary reward, training agents is particularly\nchallenging, due to a lack of successful experiences.

However, generating successful experiences without\nconsideration of the property of achieved goals is less efficient. In this\npaper, a novel cluster-based sampling strategy exploiting the property of\nachieved goals is proposed. The proposed sampling strategy groups episodes with\ndifferent achieved goals and samples experiences in the manner of HER. For the\ngrouping, K-means clustering algorithm is used. The centroids of the clusters\nare obtained from the distribution of failed goals defined as the original\ngoals not achieved. The proposed method is validated by experiments with three\nrobotic control tasks of the OpenAI Gym. The results of experiments demonstrate\nthat the proposed method significantly reduces the number of epochs required\nfor convergence in two of the three tasks and marginally increases the success\nrates in the remaining one.

We propose\na simple state-of-the-art multi-view depth estimator with two main\ncontributions: 1) a carefully-designed 2D CNN which utilizes strong image\npriors alongside a plane-sweep feature volume and geometric losses, combined\nwith 2) the integration of keyframe and geometric metadata into the cost volume\nwhich allows informed depth plane scoring.

However, the formulated\nnon-linear fractional programming problem is challenging to solve due to its\nnon-convexity and coupled variables. To overcome the difficulty, we propose an\nalternating optimization based algorithm to solve it sub-optimally by\nleveraging Dinkelbach's algorithm, successive convex approximation (SCA)\ntechnique, and block coordinate descent (BCD) method. Extensive simulation\nresults show that the proposed design can significantly improve the\nanti-jamming performance. In particular, for the remote jammer case, the\nproposed design can largely shorten the flight path and thus decrease the\nenergy consumption via the signal enhancement; while for the local jammer case,\nwhich is deemed highly challenging in conventional systems without IRS since\nthe retreating away strategy becomes ineffective, our proposed design even\nachieves a higher performance gain owing to the efficient jamming signal\nmitigation.",

    "abstract": "In large-scale retrieval, the lexicon-weighting paradigm, learning weighted\nsparse representations in vocabulary space, has shown promising results with\nhigh quality and low latency. Despite it deeply exploiting the\nlexicon-representing capability of pre-trained language models, a crucial gap\nremains between language modeling and lexicon-weighting retrieval -- the former\npreferring certain or low-entropy words whereas the latter favoring pivot or\nhigh-entropy words -- becoming the main barrier to lexicon-weighting\nperformance for large-scale retrieval. To bridge this gap, we propose a\nbrand-new pre-training framework, lexicon-bottlenecked masked autoencoder\n(LexMAE), to learn importance-aware lexicon representations. Essentially, we\npresent a lexicon-bottlenecked module between a normal language modeling\nencoder and a weakened decoder, where a continuous bag-of-words bottleneck is\nconstructed to learn a lexicon-importance distribution in an unsupervised\nfashion. The pre-trained LexMAE is readily transferred to the lexicon-weighting\nretrieval via fine-tuning, achieving 42.6\\% MRR@10 with 45.83 QPS on a CPU\nmachine for the passage retrieval benchmark, MS-Marco.

    "abstract": "We describe an algorithm to find maximal exact matches (MEMs) among HiFi\nreads with homopolymer errors. The main novelty in our work is that we resort\nto run-length compression to help deal with errors. Our method receives as\ninput a run-length-encoded string collection containing the HiFi reads along\nwith their reverse complements. Subsequently, it splits the encoding into two\narrays, one storing the sequence of symbols for equal-symbol runs and another\nstoring the run lengths. The purpose of the split is to get the BWT of the run\nsymbols and reorder their lengths accordingly. We show that this special BWT,\nas it encodes the HiFi reads and their reverse complements, supports\nbi-directional queries for the HiFi reads. Then, we propose a variation of the\nMEM algorithm of Belazzougui et al. (2013) that exploits the run-length\nencoding and the implicit bi-directional property of our BWT to compute\napproximate MEMs. Concretely, if the algorithm finds that two substrings, $a_1\n\\ldots a_p$ and $b_1 \\ldots b_p$, have a MEM, then it reports the MEM only if\ntheir corresponding length sequences, $\\ell^{a}_1 \\ldots \\ell^{a}_p$ and\n$\\ell^{b}_1 \\ldots \\ell^{b}_p$, do not differ beyond an input threshold. We use\na simple metric to calculate the similarity of the length sequences that we\ncall the {\\em run-length excess}. Our technique facilitates the detection of\nMEMs with homopolymer errors as it does not require dynamic programming to find\napproximate matches where the only edits are the lengths of the equal-symbol\nruns. Finally, we present a method that relies on a geometric data structure to\nreport the text occurrences of the MEMs detected by our algorithm.",

However, mainstream 3D detectors, e.g.,\nVoteNet and its variants, either abandon considerable local features during\npooling operations or ignore many global features in the whole scene context.\nThis paper explores new modules to simultaneously learn local-global features\nof scene point clouds that serve 3OD positively. To this end, we propose an\neffective 3OD network via simultaneous local-global feature learning (dubbed\n3DLG-Detector). 3DLG-Detector has two key contributions. First, it develops a\nDynamic Points Interaction (DPI) module that preserves effective local features\nduring pooling. Besides, DPI is detachable and can be incorporated into\nexisting 3OD networks to boost their performance. Second, it develops a Global\nContext Aggregation module to aggregate multi-scale features from different\nlayers of the encoder to achieve scene context-awareness.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider a ${\\rm U}(1)$-connection graph, that is, a graph\nwhere each oriented edge is endowed with a unit modulus complex number which is\nsimply conjugated under orientation flip. A natural replacement for the\ncombinatorial Laplacian is then the so-called magnetic Laplacian, an Hermitian\nmatrix that includes information about the graph's connection. Connection\ngraphs and magnetic Laplacians appear, e.g., in the problem of angular\nsynchronization. In the context of large and dense graphs, we study here\nsparsifiers of the magnetic Laplacian, i.e., spectral approximations based on\nsubgraphs with few edges. Our approach relies on sampling multi-type spanning\nforests (MTSFs) using a custom determinantal point process, a distribution over\nedges that favours diversity. In a word, an MTSF is a spanning subgraph whose\nconnected components are either trees or cycle-rooted trees. The latter\npartially capture the angular inconsistencies of the connection graph, and thus\nprovide a way to compress information contained in the connection.\nInterestingly, when this connection graph has weakly inconsistent cycles,\nsamples of this distribution can be obtained by using a random walk with cycle\npopping. We provide statistical guarantees for a choice of natural estimators\nof the connection Laplacian, and investigate the practical application of our\nsparsifiers in two applications.",

    "abstract": "Flaky tests are tests that yield different outcomes when run on the same\nversion of a program. This non-deterministic behaviour plagues continuous\nintegration with false signals, wasting developers' time and reducing their\ntrust in test suites. Studies highlighted the importance of keeping tests\nflakiness-free. Recently, the research community has been pushing forward the\ndetection of flaky tests by suggesting many static and dynamic approaches.\nWhile promising, those approaches mainly focus on classifying tests as flaky or\nnot and, even when high performances are reported, it remains challenging to\nunderstand the cause of flakiness. This part is crucial for researchers and\ndevelopers that aim to fix it. To help with the comprehension of a given flaky\ntest, we propose FlakyCat, the first approach for classifying flaky tests based\non their root cause category. FlakyCat relies on CodeBERT for code\nrepresentation and leverages a Siamese network-based Few-Shot learning method\nto train a multi-class classifier with few data. We train and evaluate FlakyCat\non a set of 343 flaky tests collected from open-source Java projects. Our\nevaluation shows that FlakyCat categorises flaky tests accurately, with a\nweighted F1 score of 70%. Furthermore, we investigate the performance of our\napproach for each category, revealing that Async waits, Unordered collections\nand Time-related flaky tests are accurately classified, while\nConcurrency-related flaky tests are more challenging to predict.

In this\narticle we consider the situation of a large area containing randomly placed\npoints (representing points of interest), as well a number of randomly-placed\ndisks of equal radius in the same region (representing individual sensors'\ncoverage areas). The problem of finding the smallest possible set of disks that\ncover the given points is known to be NP-complete. We show that the\ncomputational complexity may be reduced by classifying the disks into several\ndefinite classes that can be characterized as necessary, excludable, or\nindeterminate. The problem may then be reduced to considering only the\nindeterminate sets and the points that they cover. In addition, indeterminate\nsets and the points that they cover may be divided into disjoint ``islands''\nthat can be solved separately. Hence the actual complexity is determined by the\nnumber of points and sets in the largest island. We run a number of simulations\nto show how the proportion of sets and points of various types depend on two\nbasic scale-invariant parameters related to point and set density. We show that\nenormous reductions in complexity can be achieved even in situations where\npoint and set density is relatively high.",

Federated\nLearning enables machine learning models to train locally on each handheld\ndevice while only synchronizing their neuron updates with a server. While this\nenables user privacy, technology scaling and software advancements have\nresulted in handheld devices with varying performance capabilities. This\nresults in the training time of federated learning tasks to be dictated by a\nfew low-performance straggler devices, essentially becoming a bottleneck to the\nentire training process. In this work, we aim to mitigate the performance\nbottleneck of federated learning by dynamically forming sub-models for\nstragglers based on their performance and accuracy feedback. To this end, we\noffer the Invariant Dropout, a dynamic technique that forms a sub-model based\non the neuron update threshold. Invariant Dropout uses neuron updates from the\nnon-straggler clients to develop a tailored sub-models for each straggler\nduring each training iteration. All corresponding weights which have a\nmagnitude less than the threshold are dropped for the iteration. We evaluate\nInvariant Dropout using five real-world mobile clients.

    "title": "Cadence Detection in Symbolic Classical Music using Graph Neural  Networks",
    "abstract": "Cadences are complex structures that have been driving music from the\nbeginning of contrapuntal polyphony until today. Detecting such structures is\nvital for numerous MIR tasks such as musicological analysis, key detection, or\nmusic segmentation. However, automatic cadence detection remains challenging\nmainly because it involves a combination of high-level musical elements like\nharmony, voice leading, and rhythm. In this work, we present a graph\nrepresentation of symbolic scores as an intermediate means to solve the cadence\ndetection task. We approach cadence detection as an imbalanced node\nclassification problem using a Graph Convolutional Network. We obtain results\nthat are roughly on par with the state of the art, and we present a model\ncapable of making predictions at multiple levels of granularity, from\nindividual notes to beats, thanks to the fine-grained, note-by-note\nrepresentation. Moreover, our experiments suggest that graph convolution can\nlearn non-local features that assist in cadence detection, freeing us from the\nneed of having to devise specialized features that encode non-local context. We\nargue that this general approach to modeling musical scores and classification\ntasks has a number of potential advantages, beyond the specific recognition\ntask presented here.",

Most of the architectures\ninclude either encoders alone or encoders and decoders, i.e., autoencoders of\nvarious sorts, to transform multi-omics data into latent representations. One\nimportant parameter is the depth of integration: the point at which the latent\nrepresentations are computed or merged, which can be either early,\nintermediate, or late. The literature on integration methods is growing\nsteadily, however, close to nothing is known about the relative performance of\nthese methods under fair experimental conditions and under consideration of\ndifferent use cases. We developed a comparison framework that trains and\noptimizes multi-omics integration methods under equal conditions. We\nincorporated early integration and four recently published deep learning\nmethods: MOLI, Super.FELT, OmiEmbed, and MOMA. Further, we devised a novel\nmethod, Omics Stacking, that combines the advantages of intermediate and late\nintegration. Experiments were conducted on a public drug response data set with\nmultiple omics data (somatic point mutations, somatic copy number profiles and\ngene expression profiles) that was obtained from cell lines, patient-derived\nxenografts, and patient samples. Our experiments confirmed that early\nintegration has the lowest predictive performance. Overall, architectures that\nintegrate triplet loss achieved the best results. Statistical differences can,\noverall, rarely be observed, however, in terms of the average ranks of methods,\nSuper.FELT is consistently performing best in a cross-validation setting and\nOmics Stacking best in an external test set setting.

    "abstract": "Modeling the human body in a canonical space is a common practice for\ncapturing and animation. But when involving the neural radiance field (NeRF),\nlearning a static NeRF in the canonical space is not enough because the\nlighting of the body changes when the person moves even though the scene\nlighting is constant. Previous methods alleviate the inconsistency of lighting\nby learning a per-frame embedding, but this operation does not generalize to\nunseen poses. Given that the lighting condition is static in the world space\nwhile the human body is consistent in the canonical space, we propose a\ndual-space NeRF that models the scene lighting and the human body with two MLPs\nin two separate spaces. To bridge these two spaces, previous methods mostly\nrely on the linear blend skinning (LBS) algorithm. However, the blending\nweights for LBS of a dynamic neural field are intractable and thus are usually\nmemorized with another MLP, which does not generalize to novel poses. Although\nit is possible to borrow the blending weights of a parametric mesh such as\nSMPL, the interpolation operation introduces more artifacts. In this paper, we\npropose to use the barycentric mapping, which can directly generalize to unseen\nposes and surprisingly achieves superior results than LBS with neural blending\nweights.

    "abstract": "In ridepooling systems with electric fleets, charging is a complex\ndecision-making process. Most electric vehicle (EV) taxi services require\ndrivers to make egoistic decisions, leading to decentralized ad-hoc charging\nstrategies. The current state of the mobility system is often lacking or not\nshared between vehicles, making it impossible to make a system-optimal\ndecision. Most existing approaches do not combine time, location and duration\ninto a comprehensive control algorithm or are unsuitable for real-time\noperation. We therefore present a real-time predictive charging method for\nridepooling services with a single operator, called Idle Time Exploitation\n(ITX), which predicts the periods where vehicles are idle and exploits these\nperiods to harvest energy. It relies on Graph Convolutional Networks and a\nlinear assignment algorithm to devise an optimal pairing of vehicles and\ncharging stations, in pursuance of maximizing the exploited idle time. We\nevaluated our approach through extensive simulation studies on real-world\ndatasets from New York City. The results demonstrate that ITX outperforms all\nbaseline methods by at least 5% (equivalent to $70,000 for a 6,000 vehicle\noperation) per week in terms of a monetary reward function which was modeled to\nreplicate the profitability of a real-world ridepooling system. Moreover, ITX\ncan reduce delays by at least 4.68% in comparison with baseline methods and\ngenerally increase passenger comfort by facilitating a better spread of\ncustomers across the fleet. Our results also demonstrate that ITX enables\nvehicles to harvest energy during the day, stabilizing battery levels and\nincreasing resilience to unexpected surges in demand. Lastly, compared to the\nbest-performing baseline strategy, peak loads are reduced by 17.39% which\nbenefits grid operators and paves the way for more sustainable use of the\nelectrical grid.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel method of learning style-agnostic representation using\nboth style transfer and adversarial learning in the reinforcement learning\nframework. The style, here, refers to task-irrelevant details such as the color\nof the background in the images, where generalizing the learned policy across\nenvironments with different styles is still a challenge. Focusing on learning\nstyle-agnostic representations, our method trains the actor with diverse image\nstyles generated from an inherent adversarial style perturbation generator,\nwhich plays a min-max game between the actor and the generator, without\ndemanding expert knowledge for data augmentation or additional class labels for\nadversarial training. We verify that our method achieves competitive or better\nperformances than the state-of-the-art approaches on Procgen and Distracting\nControl Suite benchmarks, and further investigate the features extracted from\nour model, showing that the model better captures the invariants and is less\ndistracted by the shifted style.

A line of works, called the\nclustering of bandits (CLUB), utilize the collaborative effect over users and\ndramatically improve the recommendation quality. Owing to the increasing\napplication scale and public concerns about privacy, there is a growing demand\nto keep user data decentralized and push bandit learning to the local server\nside. Existing CLUB algorithms, however, are designed under the centralized\nsetting where data are available at a central server. We focus on studying the\nfederated online clustering of bandit (FCLUB) problem, which aims to minimize\nthe total regret while satisfying privacy and communication considerations. We\ndesign a new phase-based scheme for cluster detection and a novel asynchronous\ncommunication protocol for cooperative bandit learning for this problem. To\nprotect users' privacy, previous differential privacy (DP) definitions are not\nvery suitable, and we propose a new DP notion that acts on the user cluster\nlevel. We provide rigorous proofs to show that our algorithm simultaneously\nachieves (clustered) DP, sublinear communication complexity and sublinear\nregret.

    "abstract": "The use of counterfactual explanations (CFXs) is an increasingly popular\nexplanation strategy for machine learning models. However, recent studies have\nshown that these explanations may not be robust to changes in the underlying\nmodel (e.g., following retraining), which raises questions about their\nreliability in real-world applications. Existing attempts towards solving this\nproblem are heuristic, and the robustness to model changes of the resulting\nCFXs is evaluated with only a small number of retrained models, failing to\nprovide exhaustive guarantees. To remedy this, we propose the first notion to\nformally and deterministically assess the robustness (to model changes) of CFXs\nfor neural networks, that we call {\\Delta}-robustness. We introduce an\nabstraction framework based on interval neural networks to verify the\n{\\Delta}-robustness of CFXs against a possibly infinite set of changes to the\nmodel parameters, i.e., weights and biases. We then demonstrate the utility of\nthis approach in two distinct ways. First, we analyse the {\\Delta}-robustness\nof a number of CFX generation methods from the literature and show that they\nunanimously host significant deficiencies in this regard. Second, we\ndemonstrate how embedding {\\Delta}-robustness within existing methods can\nprovide CFXs which are provably robust.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the multimedia problem of temporal sentence grounding\n(TSG), which aims to accurately determine the specific video segment in an\nuntrimmed video according to a given sentence query. Traditional TSG methods\nmainly follow the top-down or bottom-up framework and are not end-to-end. They\nseverely rely on time-consuming post-processing to refine the grounding\nresults. Recently, some transformer-based approaches are proposed to\nefficiently and effectively model the fine-grained semantic alignment between\nvideo and query. Although these methods achieve significant performance to some\nextent, they equally take frames of the video and words of the query as\ntransformer input for correlating, failing to capture their different levels of\ngranularity with distinct semantics. To address this issue, in this paper, we\npropose a novel Hierarchical Local-Global Transformer (HLGT) to leverage this\nhierarchy information and model the interactions between different levels of\ngranularity and different modalities for learning more fine-grained multi-modal\nrepresentations. Specifically, we first split the video and query into\nindividual clips and phrases to learn their local context (adjacent dependency)\nand global correlation (long-range dependency) via a temporal transformer.\nThen, a global-local transformer is introduced to learn the interactions\nbetween the local-level and global-level semantics for better multi-modal\nreasoning. Besides, we develop a new cross-modal cycle-consistency loss to\nenforce interaction between two modalities and encourage the semantic alignment\nbetween them. Finally, we design a brand-new cross-modal parallel transformer\ndecoder to integrate the encoded visual and textual features for final\ngrounding. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets show that our\nproposed HLGT achieves a new state-of-the-art performance.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised hashing has attracted much attention for binary representation\nlearning due to the requirement of economical storage and efficiency of binary\ncodes. It aims to encode high-dimensional features in the Hamming space with\nsimilarity preservation between instances. However, most existing methods learn\nhash functions in manifold-based approaches. Those methods capture the local\ngeometric structures (i.e., pairwise relationships) of data, and lack\nsatisfactory performance in dealing with real-world scenarios that produce\nsimilar features (e.g. color and shape) with different semantic information. To\naddress this challenge, in this work, we propose an effective unsupervised\nmethod, namely Jointly Personalized Sparse Hashing (JPSH), for binary\nrepresentation learning. To be specific, firstly, we propose a novel\npersonalized hashing module, i.e., Personalized Sparse Hashing (PSH). Different\npersonalized subspaces are constructed to reflect category-specific attributes\nfor different clusters, adaptively mapping instances within the same cluster to\nthe same Hamming space. In addition, we deploy sparse constraints for different\npersonalized subspaces to select important features. We also collect the\nstrengths of the other clusters to build the PSH module with avoiding\nover-fitting. Then, to simultaneously preserve semantic and pairwise\nsimilarities in our JPSH, we incorporate the PSH and manifold-based hash\nlearning into the seamless formulation. As such, JPSH not only distinguishes\nthe instances from different clusters, but also preserves local neighborhood\nstructures within the cluster. Finally, an alternating optimization algorithm\nis adopted to iteratively capture analytical solutions of the JPSH model.\nExtensive experiments on four benchmark datasets verify that the JPSH\noutperforms several hashing algorithms on the similarity search task.",

    "title": "Improving RGB-D Point Cloud Registration by Learning Multi-scale Local  Linear Transformation",
    "abstract": "Point cloud registration aims at estimating the geometric transformation\nbetween two point cloud scans, in which point-wise correspondence estimation is\nthe key to its success. In addition to previous methods that seek\ncorrespondences by hand-crafted or learnt geometric features, recent point\ncloud registration methods have tried to apply RGB-D data to achieve more\naccurate correspondence. However, it is not trivial to effectively fuse the\ngeometric and visual information from these two distinctive modalities,\nespecially for the registration problem. In this work, we propose a new\nGeometry-Aware Visual Feature Extractor (GAVE) that employs multi-scale local\nlinear transformation to progressively fuse these two modalities, where the\ngeometric features from the depth data act as the geometry-dependent\nconvolution kernels to transform the visual features from the RGB data. The\nresultant visual-geometric features are in canonical feature spaces with\nalleviated visual dissimilarity caused by geometric changes, by which more\nreliable correspondence can be achieved. The proposed GAVE module can be\nreadily plugged into recent RGB-D point cloud registration framework. Extensive\nexperiments on 3D Match and ScanNet demonstrate that our method outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art point cloud registration methods even without correspondence\nor pose supervision.

More recent deep\nlearning approaches popularize recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and, in\nparticular, long short-term memory (LSTM) cells that have become one of the\nbest performing and most common building blocks in neural time series modeling.\nWhile advantageous for time series data or sequences with long-term effects,\ncomplex RNN cells are not always a must and can sometimes even be inferior to\nsimpler recurrent approaches. In this work, we introduce the ARMA cell, a\nsimpler, modular, and effective approach for time series modeling in neural\nnetworks. This cell can be used in any neural network architecture where\nrecurrent structures are present and naturally handles multivariate time series\nusing vector autoregression.

Among these, the most representative\nproposal is certainly Tarzan, which is designed to obtain strong anonymity\nstill preserving low-latency applications.

Deep learning has\nachieved state-of-the-art performance in many clinical NLP tasks. However,\ntraining deep learning models usually require large annotated datasets, which\nare normally not publicly available and can be time-consuming to build in\nclinical domains. Working with smaller annotated datasets is typical in\nclinical NLP and therefore, ensuring that deep learning models perform well is\ncrucial for the models to be used in real-world applications. A widely adopted\napproach is fine-tuning existing Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), but these\nattempts fall short when the training dataset contains only a few annotated\nsamples. Few-Shot Learning (FSL) has recently been investigated to tackle this\nproblem. Siamese Neural Network (SNN) has been widely utilized as an FSL\napproach in computer vision, but has not been studied well in NLP. Furthermore,\nthe literature on its applications in clinical domains is scarce. In this\npaper, we propose two SNN-based FSL approaches for clinical NLP, including\npre-trained SNN (PT-SNN) and SNN with second-order embeddings (SOE-SNN). We\nevaluated the proposed approaches on two clinical tasks, namely clinical text\nclassification and clinical named entity recognition. We tested three few-shot\nsettings including 4-shot, 8-shot, and 16-shot learning. Both clinical NLP\ntasks were benchmarked using three PLMs, including BERT, BioBERT, and\nBioClinicalBERT.

Existing attack methods have\ncommonly exploited the output information (mostly, losses) solely from the\ngiven target model. As a result, in practical scenarios where both the member\nand non-member samples yield similarly small losses, these methods are\nnaturally unable to differentiate between them. To address this limitation, in\nthis paper, we propose a new attack method, called \\system, which can exploit\nthe membership information from the whole training process of the target model\nfor improving the attack performance. To mount the attack in the common\nblack-box setting, we leverage knowledge distillation, and represent the\nmembership information by the losses evaluated on a sequence of intermediate\nmodels at different distillation epochs, namely \\emph{distilled loss\ntrajectory}, together with the loss from the given target model. Experimental\nresults over different datasets and model architectures demonstrate the great\nadvantage of our attack in terms of different metrics. For example, on\nCINIC-10, our attack achieves at least 6$\\times$ higher true-positive rate at a\nlow false-positive rate of 0.1\\% than existing methods.

    "title": "A Realism Metric for Generated LiDAR Point Clouds",
    "abstract": "A considerable amount of research is concerned with the generation of\nrealistic sensor data. LiDAR point clouds are generated by complex simulations\nor learned generative models. The generated data is usually exploited to enable\nor improve downstream perception algorithms. Two major questions arise from\nthese procedures: First, how to evaluate the realism of the generated data?\nSecond, does more realistic data also lead to better perception performance?\nThis paper addresses both questions and presents a novel metric to quantify the\nrealism of LiDAR point clouds. Relevant features are learned from real-world\nand synthetic point clouds by training on a proxy classification task. In a\nseries of experiments, we demonstrate the application of our metric to\ndetermine the realism of generated LiDAR data and compare the realism\nestimation of our metric to the performance of a segmentation model. We confirm\nthat our metric provides an indication for the downstream segmentation\nperformance.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by applications in polymer-based data storage, we study the problem\nof reconstructing a string from part of its composition multiset. We give a\nfull description of the structure of the strings that cannot be uniquely\nreconstructed (up to reversal) from their multiset of all of their\nprefix-suffix compositions. Leveraging this description, we prove that for all\n$n\\ge 6$, there exists a string of length $n$ that cannot be uniquely\nreconstructed up to reversal. Moreover, for all $n\\ge 6$, we explicitly\nconstruct the set consisting of all length $n$ strings that can be uniquely\nreconstructed up to reversal. As a by product, we obtain that any binary string\ncan be constructed using Dyck strings and Catalan-Bertrand strings.\nFor any given string $\\bbs$, we provide a method to explicitly construct the\nset of all strings with the same prefix-suffix composition multiset as $\\bbs$,\nas well as a formula for the size of this set. As an application, we construct\na composition code of maximal size. Furthermore, we construct two classes of\ncomposition codes which can respectively correct composition missing errors and\nmass reducing substitution errors.\nIn addition, we raise two new problems: reconstructing a string from its\ncomposition multiset when at most a constant number of substring compositions\nare lost; reconstructing a string when only given its compositions of\nsubstrings of length at most $r$. For each of these setups, we give suitable\ncodes under some conditions.",

    "abstract": "Deep-learning-based device fingerprinting has recently been recognized as a\nkey enabler for automated network access authentication. Its robustness to\nimpersonation attacks due to the inherent difficulty of replicating physical\nfeatures is what distinguishes it from conventional cryptographic solutions.\nAlthough device fingerprinting has shown promising performances, its\nsensitivity to changes in the network operating environment still poses a major\nlimitation. This paper presents an experimental framework that aims to study\nand overcome the sensitivity of LoRa-enabled device fingerprinting to such\nchanges. We first begin by describing RF datasets we collected using our\nLoRa-enabled wireless device testbed. We then propose a new fingerprinting\ntechnique that exploits out-of-band distortion information caused by hardware\nimpairments to increase the fingerprinting accuracy. Finally, we experimentally\nstudy and analyze the sensitivity of LoRa RF fingerprinting to various network\nsetting changes. Our results show that fingerprinting does relatively well when\nthe learning models are trained and tested under the same settings. However,\nwhen trained and tested under different settings, these models exhibit moderate\nsensitivity to channel condition changes and severe sensitivity to protocol\nconfiguration and receiver hardware changes when IQ data is used as input.\nHowever, with FFT data is used as input, they perform poorly under any change.",

Our contribution is twofold. First, by leveraging\nresults from spectral and causality theories, we expose a novel probabilistic\ngenerative model, which allows to sample an MN-DAG according to user-specified\npriors concerning the time-dependence and multiscale properties of the causal\ngraph. Second, we devise a Bayesian method for the estimation of MN-DAGs, by\nmeans of stochastic variational inference (SVI), called Multiscale\nNon-Stationary Causal Structure Learner (MN-CASTLE). In addition to direct\nobservations, MN-CASTLE exploits information from the decomposition of the\ntotal power spectrum of time series over different time resolutions. In our\nexperiments, we first use the proposed model to generate synthetic data\naccording to a latent MN-DAG, showing that the data generated reproduces\nwell-known features of time series in different domains. Then we compare our\nlearning method MN-CASTLE against baseline models on synthetic data generated\nwith different multiscale and non-stationary settings, confirming the good\nperformance of MN-CASTLE.

    "abstract": "Human motion modeling is important for many modern graphics applications,\nwhich typically require professional skills. In order to remove the skill\nbarriers for laymen, recent motion generation methods can directly generate\nhuman motions conditioned on natural languages. However, it remains challenging\nto achieve diverse and fine-grained motion generation with various text inputs.\nTo address this problem, we propose MotionDiffuse, the first diffusion\nmodel-based text-driven motion generation framework, which demonstrates several\ndesired properties over existing methods. 1) Probabilistic Mapping. Instead of\na deterministic language-motion mapping, MotionDiffuse generates motions\nthrough a series of denoising steps in which variations are injected. 2)\nRealistic Synthesis. MotionDiffuse excels at modeling complicated data\ndistribution and generating vivid motion sequences. 3) Multi-Level\nManipulation. MotionDiffuse responds to fine-grained instructions on body\nparts, and arbitrary-length motion synthesis with time-varied text prompts. Our\nexperiments show MotionDiffuse outperforms existing SoTA methods by convincing\nmargins on text-driven motion generation and action-conditioned motion\ngeneration. A qualitative analysis further demonstrates MotionDiffuse's\ncontrollability for comprehensive motion generation. Homepage:\nhttps://mingyuan-zhang.github.io/projects/MotionDiffuse.html",

Conditional entropy is then\ninterpreted as the knowledge gained upon learning the outcome of one random\nexperiment after learning the outcome of another, possibly statistically\ndependent, random experiment. In the classical world, entropy and conditional\nentropy take only non-negative values, consistent with the intuition that one\nhas regarding the aforementioned interpretations.

Here, we derive a unique set of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based\nmarkers capturing the heterogeneity of tumor infiltration, by characterizing\nfree water movement restriction in the peritumoral region using Diffusion\nTensor Imaging (DTI)-based free water volume fraction maps.

    "abstract": "Suppose $L$ simultaneous independent stochastic systems generate\nobservations, where the observations from each system depend on the underlying\nparameter of that system. The observations are unlabeled (anonymized), in the\nsense that an analyst does not know which observation came from which\nstochastic system. How can the analyst estimate the underlying parameters of\nthe $L$ systems? Since the anonymized observations at each time are an\nunordered set of L measurements (rather than a vector), classical stochastic\ngradient algorithms cannot be directly used. By using symmetric polynomials, we\nformulate a symmetric measurement equation that maps the observation set to a\nunique vector. By exploiting that fact that the algebraic ring of\nmulti-variable polynomials is a unique factorization domain over the ring of\none-variable polynomials, we construct an adaptive filtering algorithm that\nyields a statistically consistent estimate of the underlying parameters. We\nanalyze the asymptotic covariance of these estimates to quantify the effect of\nanonymization. Finally, we characterize the anonymity of the observations in\nterms of the error probability of the maximum aposteriori Bayesian estimator.\nUsing Blackwell dominance of mean preserving spreads, we construct a partial\nordering of the noise densities which relates the anonymity of the observations\nto the asymptotic covariance of the adaptive filtering algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Optical Coherence Tomography(OCT) is a non-invasive technique capturing\ncross-sectional area of the retina in micro-meter resolutions. It has been\nwidely used as a auxiliary imaging reference to detect eye-related pathology\nand predict longitudinal progression of the disease characteristics. Retina\nlayer segmentation is one of the crucial feature extraction techniques, where\nthe variations of retinal layer thicknesses and the retinal layer deformation\ndue to the presence of the fluid are highly correlated with multiple epidemic\neye diseases like Diabetic Retinopathy(DR) and Age-related Macular Degeneration\n(AMD). However, these images are acquired from different devices, which have\ndifferent intensity distribution, or in other words, belong to different\nimaging domains. This paper proposes a segmentation-guided domain-adaptation\nmethod to adapt images from multiple devices into single image domain, where\nthe state-of-art pre-trained segmentation model is available. It avoids the\ntime consumption of manual labelling for the upcoming new dataset and the\nre-training of the existing network. The semantic consistency and global\nfeature consistency of the network will minimize the hallucination effect that\nmany researchers reported regarding Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial\nNetworks(CycleGAN) architecture.",

Clinician performance was evaluated against\nclinically confirmed diagnoses.\nSetting: The study analysed anonymised patient data from an NHS hospital; the\ndataset consisted of 400 chest radiographs from adult patients (18 years and\nabove) who had a CXR performed in 2020, with corresponding clinical text\nreports.\nParticipants: A panel of readers consisting of 11 clinicians (consultant\nradiologists, radiologist trainees and reporting radiographers) participated in\nthis study.\nMain outcome measures: Overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and\nprecision for detecting lung cancer on CXRs by clinicians, with and without AI\ninput.

    "abstract": "Modeling and control of epidemics such as the novel Corona virus have assumed\nparamount importance at a global level. A natural and powerful dynamical\nmodeling framework that has emerged in this context is a continuous time Markov\ndecision process (CTMDP) that encompasses classical compartmental paradigms\nsuch as the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model. Using a CTMDP based\nmodel poses certain technical and computational challenges. These challenges\nmotivate the need for a more efficient approach and the mean field approach\noffers an effective alternative. The mean field approach computes the\ncollective behavior of a dynamical system comprising numerous interacting nodes\n(where nodes represent individuals in the population). This paper provides a\nstate-of-the-art update on recent advances in the mean field approach to\nepidemic modeling and control. Our discussion in this paper proceeds in two\nthreads. The first thread assumes that the individual nodes faithfully follow a\nsocially optimal control policy prescribed by a regulatory authority. The\nsecond thread allows the individual nodes to exhibit independent, strategic\nbehavior. In this case, the strategic interaction is modeled as a mean field\ngame and the control is based on the associated mean field Nash equilibria. In\nthis paper, we start with a discussion of modeling of epidemics using an\nextended compartmental model - SIVR and provide an illustrative example. We\nthen provide a review of relevant literature, using a mean field approach, on\noptimal control of epidemics, dealing with how a regulatory authority may\noptimally contain epidemic spread in a population. Following this, we provide\nan update on the state-of-the-art literature on the use of the mean field game\nbased approach in the study of epidemic spread and control. We conclude the\npaper with some future research directions.",

The deep unrolling networks are currently\nthe state-of-the-art solutions for imaging inverse problems. However, for\nhigh-dimensional imaging tasks, especially X-ray CT and MRI imaging, the deep\nunrolling schemes typically become inefficient both in terms of memory and\ncomputation, due to the need of computing multiple times the high-dimensional\nforward and adjoint operators. Recently researchers have found that such\nlimitations can be partially addressed by unrolling the stochastic gradient\ndescent (SGD), inspired by the success of stochastic first-order optimization.\nIn this work, we explore further this direction and propose first a more\nexpressive and practical stochastic primal-dual unrolling, based on the\nstate-of-the-art Learned Primal-Dual (LPD) network, and also a further\nacceleration upon stochastic primal-dual unrolling, using sketching techniques\nto approximate products in the high-dimensional image space. The operator\nsketching can be jointly applied with stochastic unrolling for the best\nacceleration and compression performance. Our numerical experiments on X-ray CT\nimage reconstruction demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of our\naccelerated unrolling schemes.",

Previous\nmulti-modal MRI segmentation methods usually perform modal fusion by\nconcatenating multi-modal MRIs at an early/middle stage of the network, which\nhardly explores non-linear dependencies between modalities. In this work, we\npropose a novel Nested Modality-Aware Transformer (NestedFormer) to explicitly\nexplore the intra-modality and inter-modality relationships of multi-modal MRIs\nfor brain tumor segmentation. Built on the transformer-based multi-encoder and\nsingle-decoder structure, we perform nested multi-modal fusion for high-level\nrepresentations of different modalities and apply modality-sensitive gating\n(MSG) at lower scales for more effective skip connections. Specifically, the\nmulti-modal fusion is conducted in our proposed Nested Modality-aware Feature\nAggregation (NMaFA) module, which enhances long-term dependencies within\nindividual modalities via a tri-orientated spatial-attention transformer, and\nfurther complements key contextual information among modalities via a\ncross-modality attention transformer.
