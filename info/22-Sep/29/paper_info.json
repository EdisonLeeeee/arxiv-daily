    "title": "What Are You Anxious About? Examining Subjects of Anxiety during the  COVID-19 Pandemic",
    "abstract": "COVID-19 poses disproportionate mental health consequences to the public\nduring different phases of the pandemic. We use a computational approach to\ncapture the specific aspects that trigger an online community's anxiety about\nthe pandemic and investigate how these aspects change over time. First, we\nidentified nine subjects of anxiety (SOAs) in a sample of Reddit posts ($N$=86)\nfrom r/COVID19\\_support using thematic analysis. Then, we quantified Reddit\nusers' anxiety by training algorithms on a manually annotated sample ($N$=793)\nto automatically label the SOAs in a larger chronological sample ($N$=6,535).\nThe nine SOAs align with items in various recently developed pandemic anxiety\nmeasurement scales. We observed that Reddit users' concerns about health risks\nremained high in the first eight months of the pandemic. These concerns\ndiminished dramatically despite the surge of cases occurring later. In general,\nusers' language disclosing the SOAs became less intense as the pandemic\nprogressed. However, worries about mental health and the future increased\nsteadily throughout the period covered in this study. People also tended to use\nmore intense language to describe mental health concerns than health risks or\ndeath concerns. Our results suggest that this online group's mental health\ncondition does not necessarily improve despite COVID-19 gradually weakening as\na health threat due to appropriate countermeasures. Our system lays the\ngroundwork for population health and epidemiology scholars to examine aspects\nthat provoke pandemic anxiety in a timely fashion.",

Continuous approaches\ncapture rotational equivariance but are often prohibitively computationally\ndemanding. Discrete approaches offer more favorable computational performance\nbut at the cost of equivariance. We develop a hybrid discrete-continuous\n(DISCO) group convolution that is simultaneously equivariant and\ncomputationally scalable to high-resolution. While our framework can be applied\nto any compact group, we specialize to the sphere. Our DISCO spherical\nconvolutions not only exhibit $\\text{SO}(3)$ rotational equivariance but also a\nform of asymptotic $\\text{SO}(3)/\\text{SO}(2)$ rotational equivariance, which\nis more desirable for many applications (where $\\text{SO}(n)$ is the special\northogonal group representing rotations in $n$-dimensions). Through a sparse\ntensor implementation we achieve linear scaling in number of pixels on the\nsphere for both computational cost and memory usage. For 4k spherical images we\nrealize a saving of $10^9$ in computational cost and $10^4$ in memory usage\nwhen compared to the most efficient alternative equivariant spherical\nconvolution.

    "abstract": "Operating under real world conditions is challenging due to the possibility\nof a wide range of failures induced by partial observability. In relatively\nbenign settings, such failures can be overcome by retrying or executing one of\na small number of hand-engineered recovery strategies. By contrast,\ncontact-rich sequential manipulation tasks, like opening doors and assembling\nfurniture, are not amenable to exhaustive hand-engineering. To address this\nissue, we present a general approach for robustifying manipulation strategies\nin a sample-efficient manner. Our approach incrementally improves robustness by\nfirst discovering the failure modes of the current strategy via exploration in\nsimulation and then learning additional recovery skills to handle these\nfailures. To ensure efficient learning, we propose an online algorithm Value\nUpper Confidence Limit (Value-UCL) that selects what failure modes to\nprioritize and which state to recover to such that the expected performance\nimproves maximally in every training episode. We use our approach to learn\nrecovery skills for door-opening and evaluate them both in simulation and on a\nreal robot with little fine-tuning. Compared to open-loop execution, our\nexperiments show that even a limited amount of recovery learning improves task\nsuccess substantially from 71\\% to 92.4\\% in simulation and from 75\\% to 90\\%\non a real robot.",

    "abstract": "Many visual phenomena suggest that humans use top-down generative or\nreconstructive processes to create visual percepts (e.g., imagery, object\ncompletion, pareidolia), but little is known about the role reconstruction\nplays in robust object recognition. We built an iterative encoder-decoder\nnetwork that generates an object reconstruction and used it as top-down\nattentional feedback to route the most relevant spatial and feature information\nto feed-forward object recognition processes. We tested this model using the\nchallenging out-of-distribution digit recognition dataset, MNIST-C, where 15\ndifferent types of transformation and corruption are applied to handwritten\ndigit images. Our model showed strong generalization performance against\nvarious image perturbations, on average outperforming all other models\nincluding feedforward CNNs and adversarially trained networks. Our model is\nparticularly robust to blur, noise, and occlusion corruptions, where shape\nperception plays an important role. Ablation studies further reveal two\ncomplementary roles of spatial and feature-based attention in robust object\nrecognition, with the former largely consistent with spatial masking benefits\nin the attention literature (the reconstruction serves as a mask) and the\nlatter mainly contributing to the model's inference speed (i.e., number of time\nsteps to reach a certain confidence threshold) by reducing the space of\npossible object hypotheses. We also observed that the model sometimes\nhallucinates a non-existing pattern out of noise, leading to highly\ninterpretable human-like errors. Our study shows that modeling\nreconstruction-based feedback endows AI systems with a powerful attention\nmechanism, which can help us understand the role of generating perception in\nhuman visual processing.",

    "abstract": "Autoregressive language models, which use deep learning to produce human-like\ntexts, have become increasingly widespread. Such models are powering popular\nvirtual assistants in areas like smart health, finance, and autonomous driving.\nWhile the parameters of these large language models are improving, concerns\npersist that these models might not work equally for all subgroups in society.\nDespite growing discussions of AI fairness across disciplines, there lacks\nsystemic metrics to assess what equity means in dialogue systems and how to\nengage different populations in the assessment loop. Grounded in theories of\ndeliberative democracy and science and technology studies, this paper proposes\nan analytical framework for unpacking the meaning of equity in human-AI\ndialogues. Using this framework, we conducted an auditing study to examine how\nGPT-3 responded to different sub-populations on crucial science and social\ntopics: climate change and the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. Our corpus\nconsists of over 20,000 rounds of dialogues between GPT-3 and 3290 individuals\nwho vary in gender, race and ethnicity, education level, English as a first\nlanguage, and opinions toward the issues. We found a substantively worse user\nexperience with GPT-3 among the opinion and the education minority\nsubpopulations; however, these two groups achieved the largest knowledge gain,\nchanging attitudes toward supporting BLM and climate change efforts after the\nchat. We traced these user experience divides to conversational differences and\nfound that GPT-3 used more negative expressions when it responded to the\neducation and opinion minority groups, compared to its responses to the\nmajority groups. We discuss the implications of our findings for a deliberative\nconversational AI system that centralizes diversity, equity, and inclusion.",

This paper proposes an unified framework of robotic path planning\nthrough embedding the high-dimensional temporal information contained in the\nevent stream to distinguish between safe and colliding trajectories into a\nlow-dimension space manifested with a pre-constructed 2D densely connected\ngraph. We then leverage a fast graph-traversing strategy to generate the motor\ncommands necessary to effectively avoid the approaching obstacles while\nsimultaneously intercepting a fast-moving objects.

Unlike prior literature, time-correlated fading channels is considered\nand two widely concerned quality of service (QoS) constraints, i.e., outage and\ngoodput constraints, are also considered in the optimization, which further\ndifferentiates this work from prior ones. Using a unified expression of\nasymptotic outage probabilities, optimal transmission powers and optimal rate\nare derived in closed-forms to maximize the energy efficiency while satisfying\nthe QoS constraints. These closed-form solutions then enable a thorough\nanalysis of the maximal energy efficiencies of various HARQ schemes. It is\nrevealed that with low outage constraint, the maximal energy efficiency\nachieved by Type I HARQ is $\\frac{1}{4\\ln2}$ bits/J, while HARQ-CC and HARQ-IR\ncan achieve the same maximal energy efficiency as $\\frac{\\kappa_\\infty}{4\\ln2}$\nbits/J where $\\kappa_\\infty = 1.6617$.

This paper provides an in-depth\ninvestigation on the outage performance of two different types of HARQ-aided\nTHz communications, including Type-I HARQ and HARQ with chase combining\n(HARQ-CC). Moreover, the effects of both fading and stochastic antenna\nmisalignment are considered in this paper. The exact outage probabilities of\nHARQ-aided THz communications are derived in closed-form, with which the\nasymptotic outage analysis is enabled to explore helpful insights. In\nparticular, it is revealed that full time diversity can be achieved by using\nHARQ assisted schemes. Besides, the HARQ-CC-aided scheme performs better than\nthe Type-I HARQ-aided one due to its high diversity combining gain. The\nanalytical results are eventually validated via Monte-Carlo simulations.",

The spatial randomness of users'\ndistribution, the spatial correlation among antennas and large-scale fading\nwill severally impact the system performance, but they are seldom considered in\nprior literature for MIMO-NOMA systems, and the consideration of all these\nimpact factors challenges the analysis. Based on zero-forcing (ZF) detection,\nthe exact expressions for both the average outage probability and the average\ngoodput are derived in closed-form. Moreover, the asymptotic analyses are\nconducted for both high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (/small cell radius) and\nlow SNR (/large cell radius) to gain more insightful results. In particular,\nthe diversity order is given by $\\delta = {{N_r} - {M} + 1}$, the average\noutage probability of $k$-th nearest user to the base station follows a scaling\nlaw of $O\\left({D^{\\alpha \\left( {{N_r} - {M} + 1} \\right) + 2k}}\\right)$, the\naverage goodput scales as $O({D^{2}})$ and $O({D^{-2}})$ as $D \\to 0$ and $D\n\\to \\infty$, respectively, where $N_r$, $M$, $\\alpha$ and $D$ stand for the\nnumber of receive antennas, the total number of data streams, the path loss\nexponent and the cell radius, respectively.

Despite its apparent\nadvantages, MPC protocols still pay substantial performance penalties compared\nto plaintext when applied to ML algorithms. The overhead is due to added\ncomputation and communication costs. For multiplications that are ubiquitous in\nML algorithms, MPC protocols add 32x more computational costs and 1 round of\nbroadcasting among MPC servers. Moreover, ML computations that have trivial\ncosts in plaintext, such as Softmax, ReLU, and other non-linear operations\nbecome very expensive due to added communication. Those added overheads make\nMPC less palatable to deploy in real-time ML inference frameworks, such as\nspeech translation.\nIn this work, we present MPC-Pipe, an MPC pipeline inference technique that\nuses two ML-specific approaches. 1) inter-linear-layer pipeline and 2) inner\nlayer pipeline.

These downsampling operations save computational\nresources and provide some translational invariance as well as a bigger\nreceptive field at the next layers. However, an inherent side-effect of this is\nthat high-level features, produced at the deep end of the network, are always\ncaptured in low resolution feature maps. The inverse is also true, as shallow\nlayers always contain small scale features. In biomedical image analysis\nengineers are often tasked with classifying very small image patches which\ncarry only a limited amount of information. By their nature, these patches may\nnot even contain objects, with the classification depending instead on the\ndetection of subtle underlying patterns with an unknown scale in the image's\ntexture. In these cases every bit of information is valuable; thus, it is\nimportant to extract the maximum number of informative features possible.\nDriven by these considerations, we introduce a new CNN architecture which\npreserves multi-scale features from deep, intermediate, and shallow layers by\nutilizing skip connections along with consecutive contractions and expansions\nof the feature maps.

Our\nmethod builds upon A* with jump points. We generate a novel heuristic function,\nand a collision checking and adjustment technique, thus making the A* algorithm\nconverge faster to reach the goal by exploiting and utilizing possible\ncollisions. The overall hierarchical framework generated by combining the\nglobal A* algorithm and the local deformation recovery and replanning strategy,\nas well as individual components of this framework, are tested extensively both\nin simulation and experimentally. An ablation study draws links to related\nstate-of-the-art search-based collision-avoidance planners (for the overall\nframework), as well as search-based collision-avoidance and sampling-based\ncollision-inclusive global planners (for the higher level). Results demonstrate\nour method's efficacy for collision-inclusive motion planning and control in\nunknown environments with isolated obstacles for a class of impact-resilient\nrobots operating in 2D.",

However, scaling nanodevices results in reduction of\nprogramming resolution and emergence of stochastic non-idealities. While prior\nwork has mainly focused on binary transitions, in this work we leverage the\nstochastic switching of a three-state ferroelectric field effect transistor\n(FeFET) to implement a long-term and short-term 2-tier stochastic synaptic\nmemory with a single device. Experimental measurements are performed on a\nscaled 28nm high-$k$ metal gate technology based device to develop a\nprobabilistic model of the hybrid stochastic synapse. In addition to the\nadvantage of ultra-low programming energies afforded by scaling, our\nhardware-algorithm co-design analysis reveals the efficacy of the 2-tier memory\nin comparison to binary stochastic synapses in on-chip learning tasks -- paving\nthe way for algorithms exploiting multi-state devices with probabilistic\ntransitions beyond deterministic ones.",

In contrast to prior work on\naggregated resource constraints, our formulation explicitly demands control on\nroundwise safety risks.\nUnlike existing optimistic-pessimistic paradigms for safe bandits, DOSLB\nexercises supreme optimism, using optimistic estimates of reward and safety\nscores to select actions. Yet, and surprisingly, we show that DOSLB rarely\ntakes risky actions, and obtains $\\tilde{O}(d \\sqrt{T})$ regret, where our\nnotion of regret accounts for both inefficiency and lack of safety of actions.\nSpecialising to polytopal domains, we first notably show that the\n$\\sqrt{T}$-regret bound cannot be improved even with large gaps, and then\nidentify a slackened notion of regret for which we show tight\ninstance-dependent $O(\\log^2 T)$ bounds.

    "title": "On the Choice of Databases in Differential Privacy Composition",
    "abstract": "Differential privacy (DP) is a widely applied paradigm for releasing data\nwhile maintaining user privacy. Its success is to a large part due to its\ncomposition property that guarantees privacy even in the case of multiple data\nreleases. Consequently, composition has received a lot of attention from the\nresearch community: there exist several composition theorems for adversaries\nwith different amounts of flexibility in their choice of mechanisms. But apart\nfrom mechanisms, the adversary can also choose the databases on which these\nmechanisms are invoked. The classic tool for analyzing the composition of DP\nmechanisms, the so-called composition experiment, neither allows for\nincorporating constraints on databases nor for different assumptions on the\nadversary's prior knowledge about database membership. We therefore propose a\ngeneralized composition experiment (GCE), which has this flexibility. We show\nthat composition theorems that hold with respect to the classic composition\nexperiment also hold with respect to the worst case of the GCE. This implies\nthat existing composition theorems give a privacy guarantee for more cases than\nare explicitly covered by the classic composition experiment. Beyond these\ntheoretical insights, we demonstrate two practical applications of the GCE: the\nfirst application is to give better privacy bounds in the presence of\nrestrictions on the choice of databases; the second application is to reason\nabout how the adversary's prior knowledge influences the privacy leakage. In\nthis context, we show a connection between adversaries with an uninformative\nprior and subsampling, an important primitive in DP. To the best of our\nknowledge, this paper is the first to analyze the interplay between the\ndatabases in DP composition, and thereby gives both a better understanding of\ncomposition and practical tools for obtaining better composition bounds.",

    "abstract": "Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) represent a gold standard when developing\npolicy guidelines. However, RCTs are often narrow, and lack data on broader\npopulations of interest. Causal effects in these populations are often\nestimated using observational datasets, which may suffer from unobserved\nconfounding and selection bias. Given a set of observational estimates (e.g.\nfrom multiple studies), we propose a meta-algorithm that attempts to reject\nobservational estimates that are biased. We do so using validation effects,\ncausal effects that can be inferred from both RCT and observational data. After\nrejecting estimators that do not pass this test, we generate conservative\nconfidence intervals on the extrapolated causal effects for subgroups not\nobserved in the RCT. Under the assumption that at least one observational\nestimator is asymptotically normal and consistent for both the validation and\nextrapolated effects, we provide guarantees on the coverage probability of the\nintervals output by our algorithm. To facilitate hypothesis testing in settings\nwhere causal effect transportation across datasets is necessary, we give\nconditions under which a doubly-robust estimator of group average treatment\neffects is asymptotically normal, even when flexible machine learning methods\nare used for estimation of nuisance parameters.

In this paper, we introduce the novel Hamiltonian\nadaptive importance sampling (HAIS) method. HAIS implements a two-step adaptive\nprocess with parallel HMC chains that cooperate at each iteration. The proposed\nHAIS efficiently adapts a population of proposals, extracting the advantages of\nHMC. HAIS can be understood as a particular instance of the generic layered AIS\nfamily with an additional resampling step. HAIS achieves a significant\nperformance improvement in high-dimensional problems w.r.t. state-of-the-art\nalgorithms. We discuss the statistical properties of HAIS and show its high\nperformance in two challenging examples.",

Providing this net\npositive work to an amputee requires an active prosthesis, but has the\npotential to enable more natural assisted locomotion. To this end, this paper\nuses multi-contact models of locomotion together with force-based nonlinear\noptimization-based controllers to achieve human-like kinematic behavior,\nincluding ankle push-off, on a powered transfemoral prosthesis for 2 subjects.\nIn particular, we leverage model-based control approaches for dynamic bipedal\nrobotic walking to develop a systematic method to realize human-like walking on\na powered prosthesis that does not require subject-specific tuning. We begin by\nsynthesizing an optimization problem that yields gaits that resemble human\njoint trajectories at a kinematic level, and realize these gaits on a\nprosthesis through a control Lyapunov function based nonlinear controller that\nresponds to real-time ground reaction forces and interaction forces with the\nhuman. The proposed controller is implemented on a prosthesis for two subjects\nwithout tuning between subjects, emulating subject-specific human kinematic\ntrends on the prosthesis joints.

Most work on peduncle localization has\nfocused on computer vision, but peduncles can be difficult to visually access\ndue to the cluttered nature of agricultural environments. Our work proposes an\nalternative method which relies on mechanical -- rather than visual --\nperception to localize the peduncle.

This method is performed inline as part of the\nfruit picking procedure.

Due to the extremely large\nimage coverage area (e.g., thousands square kilometers), candidate targets in\nthese images are much smaller, dimer, more changeable than those targets\nobserved by aerial-based and land-based imaging devices. Existing short imaging\ndistance-based infrared datasets and target detection methods cannot be well\nadopted to the space-based surveillance task. To address these problems, we\ndevelop a space-based infrared tiny ship detection dataset (namely,\nNUDT-SIRST-Sea) with 48 space-based infrared images and 17598 pixel-level tiny\nship annotations. Each image covers about 10000 square kilometers of area with\n10000X10000 pixels. Considering the extreme characteristics (e.g., small, dim,\nchangeable) of those tiny ships in such challenging scenes, we propose a\nmulti-level TransUNet (MTU-Net) in this paper. Specifically, we design a Vision\nTransformer (ViT) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) hybrid encoder to extract\nmulti-level features. Local feature maps are first extracted by several\nconvolution layers and then fed into the multi-level feature extraction module\n(MVTM) to capture long-distance dependency. We further propose a\ncopy-rotate-resize-paste (CRRP) data augmentation approach to accelerate the\ntraining phase, which effectively alleviates the issue of sample imbalance\nbetween targets and background. Besides, we design a FocalIoU loss to achieve\nboth target localization and shape description.

However, the majority of current studies analyse\nITC on the ideal premise that the samples in every modality are complete. This\npresumption, however, is not always valid in real-world situations. The missing\ndata issue degenerates the image-text feature learning performance and will\nfinally affect the generalization abilities in ITC tasks. Although a series of\nmethods have been proposed to address this incomplete image text clustering\nissue (IITC), the following problems still exist: 1) most existing methods\nhardly consider the distinct gap between heterogeneous feature domains. 2) For\nmissing data, the representations generated by existing methods are rarely\nguaranteed to suit clustering tasks. 3) Existing methods do not tap into the\nlatent connections both inter and intra modalities. In this paper, we propose a\nClustering-Induced Generative Incomplete Image-Text Clustering(CIGIT-C) network\nto address the challenges above. More specifically, we first use\nmodality-specific encoders to map original features to more distinctive\nsubspaces. The latent connections between intra and inter-modalities are\nthoroughly explored by using the adversarial generating network to produce one\nmodality conditional on the other modality. Finally, we update the\ncorresponding modalityspecific encoders using two KL divergence losses.\nExperiment results on public image-text datasets demonstrated that the\nsuggested method outperforms and is more effective in the IITC job.",

To address this, we introduce Multimodal\nRetrieval on Representation of ImaGe witH Text (Mr. Right), a novel and\ncomprehensive dataset for multimodal retrieval. We utilize the Wikipedia\ndataset with rich text-image examples and generate three types of text-based\nqueries with different modality information: text-related, image-related, and\nmixed.

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic continues to bring up various topics discussed or\ndebated on social media. In order to explore the impact of pandemics on\npeople's lives, it is crucial to understand the public's concerns and attitudes\ntowards pandemic-related entities (e.g., drugs, vaccines) on social media.\nHowever, models trained on existing named entity recognition (NER) or targeted\nsentiment analysis (TSA) datasets have limited ability to understand\nCOVID-19-related social media texts because these datasets are not designed or\nannotated from a medical perspective. This paper releases METS-CoV, a dataset\ncontaining medical entities and targeted sentiments from COVID-19-related\ntweets. METS-CoV contains 10,000 tweets with 7 types of entities, including 4\nmedical entity types (Disease, Drug, Symptom, and Vaccine) and 3 general entity\ntypes (Person, Location, and Organization). To further investigate tweet users'\nattitudes toward specific entities, 4 types of entities (Person, Organization,\nDrug, and Vaccine) are selected and annotated with user sentiments, resulting\nin a targeted sentiment dataset with 9,101 entities (in 5,278 tweets). To the\nbest of our knowledge, METS-CoV is the first dataset to collect medical\nentities and corresponding sentiments of COVID-19-related tweets. We benchmark\nthe performance of classical machine learning models and state-of-the-art deep\nlearning models on NER and TSA tasks with extensive experiments. Results show\nthat the dataset has vast room for improvement for both NER and TSA tasks.\nMETS-CoV is an important resource for developing better medical social media\ntools and facilitating computational social science research, especially in\nepidemiology. Our data, annotation guidelines, benchmark models, and source\ncode are publicly available (https://github.com/YLab-Open/METS-CoV) to ensure\nreproducibility.",

    "abstract": "Traffic data chronically suffer from missing and corruption, leading to\naccuracy and utility reduction in subsequent Intelligent Transportation System\n(ITS) applications. Noticing the inherent low-rank property of traffic data,\nnumerous studies formulated missing traffic data recovery as a low-rank tensor\ncompletion (LRTC) problem. Due to the non-convexity and discreteness of the\nrank minimization in LRTC, existing methods either replaced rank with convex\nsurrogates that are quite far away from the rank function or approximated rank\nwith nonconvex surrogates involving many parameters. In this study, we proposed\na Parameter-Free Non-Convex Tensor Completion model (TC-PFNC) for traffic data\nrecovery, in which a log-based relaxation term was designed to approximate\ntensor algebraic rank. Moreover, previous studies usually assumed the\nobservations are reliable without any outliers. Therefore, we extended the\nTC-PFNC to a robust version (RTC-PFNC) by modeling potential traffic data\noutliers, which can recover the missing value from partial and corrupted\nobservations and remove the anomalies in observations. The numerical solutions\nof TC-PFNC and RTC-PFNC were elaborated based on the alternating direction\nmultiplier method (ADMM). The extensive experimental results conducted on four\nreal-world traffic data sets demonstrated that the proposed methods outperform\nother state-of-the-art methods in both missing and corrupted data recovery.

Since visible\n(RGB) and infrared (IR) images can provide complementary information to handle\nlight variations, the paired images are used in many fields, such as\nmultispectral pedestrian detection, RGB-IR crowd counting and RGB-IR salient\nobject detection. Compared with natural RGB-IR images, we find detection in\naerial RGB-IR images suffers from cross-modal weakly misalignment problems,\nwhich are manifested in the position, size and angle deviations of the same\nobject. In this paper, we mainly address the challenge of cross-modal weakly\nmisalignment in aerial RGB-IR images. Specifically, we firstly explain and\nanalyze the cause of the weakly misalignment problem. Then, we propose a\nTranslation-Scale-Rotation Alignment (TSRA) module to address the problem by\ncalibrating the feature maps from these two modalities. The module predicts the\ndeviation between two modality objects through an alignment process and\nutilizes Modality-Selection (MS) strategy to improve the performance of\nalignment. Finally, a two-stream feature alignment detector (TSFADet) based on\nthe TSRA module is constructed for RGB-IR object detection in aerial images.\nWith comprehensive experiments on the public DroneVehicle datasets, we verify\nthat our method reduces the effect of the cross-modal misalignment and achieve\nrobust detection results.",

    "abstract": "Vision transformer has emerged as a new paradigm in computer vision, showing\nexcellent performance while accompanied by expensive computational cost. Image\ntoken pruning is one of the main approaches for ViT compression, due to the\nfacts that the complexity is quadratic with respect to the token number, and\nmany tokens containing only background regions do not truly contribute to the\nfinal prediction. Existing works either rely on additional modules to score the\nimportance of individual tokens, or implement a fixed ratio pruning strategy\nfor different input instances. In this work, we propose an adaptive sparse\ntoken pruning framework with a minimal cost. Our approach is based on learnable\nthresholds and leverages the Multi-Head Self-Attention to evaluate token\ninformativeness with little additional operations. Specifically, we firstly\npropose an inexpensive attention head importance weighted class attention\nscoring mechanism. Then, learnable parameters are inserted in ViT as thresholds\nto distinguish informative tokens from unimportant ones. By comparing token\nattention scores and thresholds, we can discard useless tokens hierarchically\nand thus accelerate inference. The learnable thresholds are optimized in\nbudget-aware training to balance accuracy and complexity, performing the\ncorresponding pruning configurations for different input instances. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. For example, our\nmethod improves the throughput of DeiT-S by 50% and brings only 0.2% drop in\ntop-1 accuracy, which achieves a better trade-off between accuracy and latency\nthan the previous methods.",

The\nlocal gradient is defined as a bi-directional vector with step size and\ndirection, where the step size is the number of local updates and the direction\nis divided into positive and negative according to our definition. In FedVeca,\nthe direction is influenced by the step size, thus we average the\nbi-directional vectors to reduce the effect of different step sizes. Then, we\ntheoretically analyze the relationship between the step sizes and the global\nobjective, and obtain upper bounds on the step sizes per communication round.\nBased on the upper bounds, we design an algorithm for the server and the client\nto adaptively adjusts the step sizes that make the objective close to the\noptimum.

Furthermore,\naccording to the statistical and perfect channel state information of the\nuntrustworthy receiver, we optimize the phase shifts of RIS to maximize the\nlower bound of secrecy rate (SR) and instantaneous SR, respectively, by using\nsemidefinite relaxation method. Simulation results show that both the\napproximate expression for the ESR and the optimization algorithms are\nserviceable, and even when the jitter standard variance of the trustworthy\nreceiver is greater than that of the untrustworthy one, a positive SR can still\nbe guaranteed.",

Recent studies follow a pattern that builds models based on\nfeatures instead of raw video picture information. However, we claim those\nmodels are trained complicatedly and limit application scenarios. It is hard\nfor them to segment human actions of video in real time because they must work\nafter the full video features are extracted. As the real-time action\nsegmentation task is different from TAS task, we define it as streaming video\nreal-time temporal action segmentation (SVTAS) task. In this paper, we propose\na real-time end-to-end multi-modality model for SVTAS task. More specifically,\nunder the circumstances that we cannot get any future information, we segment\nthe current human action of streaming video chunk in real time. Furthermore,\nthe model we propose combines the last steaming video chunk feature extracted\nby language model with the current image feature extracted by image model to\nimprove the quantity of real-time temporal action segmentation. To the best of\nour knowledge, it is the first multi-modality real-time temporal action\nsegmentation model. Under the same evaluation criteria as full video temporal\naction segmentation, our model segments human action in real time with less\nthan 40% of state-of-the-art model computation and achieves 90% of the accuracy\nof the full video state-of-the-art model.",

    "abstract": "We consider a practical spatially correlated reconfigurable intelligent\nsurface (RIS)-aided cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input-multiple-output\n(mMIMO) system with multi-antenna access points (APs) over spatially correlated\nRician fading channels. The minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel estimator\nis adopted to estimate the aggregated RIS channels. Then, we investigate the\nuplink spectral efficiency (SE) with the maximum ratio (MR) and the local\nminimum mean squared error (L-MMSE) combining at the APs and obtain the\nclosed-form expression for characterizing the performance of the former. The\naccuracy of our derived analytical results has been verified by extensive\nMonte-Carlo simulations. Our results show that increasing the number of RIS\nelements is always beneficial, but with diminishing returns when the number of\nRIS elements is sufficiently large. Furthermore, the effect of the number of AP\nantennas on system performance is more pronounced under a small number of RIS\nelements, while the spatial correlation of RIS elements imposes a more severe\nnegative impact on the system performance than that of the AP antennas.",

    "abstract": "This research is intended to accomplish two goals: The first goal is to\ncurate a large and information rich dataset that contains crucial and succinct\nsummaries on the players' actions and positions and the back-and-forth travel\npatterns of the volleyball in professional and NCAA Div-I indoor volleyball\ngames. While several prior studies have aimed to create similar datasets for\nother sports (e.g. badminton and soccer), creating such a dataset for indoor\nvolleyball is not yet realized. The second goal is to introduce a volleyball\ndescriptive language to fully describe the rally processes in the games and\napply the language to our dataset. Based on the curated dataset and our\ndescriptive sports language, we introduce three tasks for automated volleyball\naction and tactic analysis using our dataset: (1) Volleyball Rally Prediction,\naimed at predicting the outcome of a rally and helping players and coaches\nimprove decision-making in practice, (2) Setting Type and Hitting Type\nPrediction, to help coaches and players prepare more effectively for the game,\nand (3) Volleyball Tactics and Attacking Zone Statistics, to provide advanced\nvolleyball statistics and help coaches understand the game and opponent's\ntactics better. We conducted case studies to show how experimental results can\nprovide insights to the volleyball analysis community. Furthermore,\nexperimental evaluation based on real-world data establishes a baseline for\nfuture studies and applications of our dataset and language. This study bridges\nthe gap between the indoor volleyball field and computer science.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: To explore the capacity of deep learning algorithm to further\nstreamline and optimize urethral plate (UP) quality appraisal on 2D images\nusing the plate objective scoring tool (POST), aiming to increase the\nobjectivity and reproducibility of UP appraisal in hypospadias repair. Methods:\nThe five key POST landmarks were marked by specialists in a 691-image dataset\nof prepubertal boys undergoing primary hypospadias repair. This dataset was\nthen used to develop and validate a deep learning-based landmark detection\nmodel. The proposed framework begins with glans localization and detection,\nwhere the input image is cropped using the predicted bounding box. Next, a deep\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is used to predict the\ncoordinates of the five POST landmarks. These predicted landmarks are then used\nto assess UP quality in distal hypospadias. Results: The proposed model\naccurately localized the glans area, with a mean average precision (mAP) of\n99.5% and an overall sensitivity of 99.1%. A normalized mean error (NME) of\n0.07152 was achieved in predicting the coordinates of the landmarks, with a\nmean squared error (MSE) of 0.001 and a 20.2% failure rate at a threshold of\n0.1 NME. Conclusions: This deep learning application shows robustness and high\nprecision in using POST to appraise UP quality. Further assessment using\ninternational multi-centre image-based databases is ongoing. External\nvalidation could benefit deep learning algorithms and lead to better\nassessments, decision-making and predictions for surgical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Learning from demonstration (LfD) provides a convenient means to equip robots\nwith dexterous skills when demonstration can be obtained in robot intrinsic\ncoordinates. However, the problem of compounding errors in long and complex\nskills reduces its wide deployment. Since most such complex skills are composed\nof smaller movements that are combined, considering the target skill as a\nsequence of compact motor primitives seems reasonable. Here the problem that\nneeds to be tackled is to ensure that a motor primitive ends in a state that\nallows the successful execution of the subsequent primitive. In this study, we\nfocus on this problem by proposing to learn an explicit correction policy when\nthe expected transition state between primitives is not achieved. The\ncorrection policy is itself learned via behavior cloning by the use of a\nstate-of-the-art movement primitive learning architecture, Conditional Neural\nMotor Primitives (CNMPs). The learned correction policy is then able to produce\ndiverse movement trajectories in a context dependent way. The advantage of the\nproposed system over learning the complete task as a single action is shown\nwith a table-top setup in simulation, where an object has to be pushed through\na corridor in two steps. Then, the applicability of the proposed method to\nbi-manual knotting in the real world is shown by equipping an upper-body\nhumanoid robot with the skill of making knots over a bar in 3D space. The\nexperiments show that the robot can perform successful knotting even when the\nfaced correction cases are not part of the human demonstration set.",

This inclusion allows to ensure that\ncertain expected behavior is better reflected by the resulting models. The\nexpected behavior is defined via constraints, which refer to the function form\ne.g. monotonicity, concavity, convexity or the models image boundaries. In\naddition to the advantage of obtaining more robust and reliable models due to\ndefining constraints over the functions shape, the use of SCSR allows to find\nmodels which are more robust to noise and have a better extrapolation behavior.\nThis paper presents a mutlicriterial approach to minimize the approximation\nerror as well as the constraint violations.

Both algorithms are capable of dealing with\nmultiple objectives, whereas NSGA-II is a well established multi-objective\napproach performing well on instances with up-to 3 objectives. NSGA-III is an\nextension of the NSGA-II algorithm and was developed to handle problems with\n\"many\" objectives (more than 3 objectives). Both algorithms are executed on a\nselected set of benchmark instances from physics textbooks. The results\nindicate that both algorithms are able to find largely feasible solutions and\nNSGA-III provides slight improvements in terms of model quality.

    "title": "Thinking Hallucination for Video Captioning",
    "abstract": "With the advent of rich visual representations and pre-trained language\nmodels, video captioning has seen continuous improvement over time. Despite the\nperformance improvement, video captioning models are prone to hallucination.\nHallucination refers to the generation of highly pathological descriptions that\nare detached from the source material. In video captioning, there are two kinds\nof hallucination: object and action hallucination. Instead of endeavoring to\nlearn better representations of a video, in this work, we investigate the\nfundamental sources of the hallucination problem. We identify three main\nfactors: (i) inadequate visual features extracted from pre-trained models, (ii)\nimproper influences of source and target contexts during multi-modal fusion,\nand (iii) exposure bias in the training strategy. To alleviate these problems,\nwe propose two robust solutions: (a) the introduction of auxiliary heads\ntrained in multi-label settings on top of the extracted visual features and (b)\nthe addition of context gates, which dynamically select the features during\nfusion. The standard evaluation metrics for video captioning measures\nsimilarity with ground truth captions and do not adequately capture object and\naction relevance. To this end, we propose a new metric, COAHA (caption object\nand action hallucination assessment), which assesses the degree of\nhallucination. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the\nMSR-Video to Text (MSR-VTT) and the Microsoft Research Video Description Corpus\n(MSVD) datasets, especially by a massive margin in CIDEr score.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a gain function viewpoint of information leakage by proposing\nmaximal $g$-leakage, a rich class of operationally meaningful leakage measures\nthat subsumes recently introduced measures maximal leakage and maximal\n$\\alpha$-leakage. In maximal $g$-leakage, the gain of an adversary in guessing\nan unknown random variable is measured using a gain function applied to the\nprobability of correctly guessing. In particular, maximal $g$-leakage captures\nthe multiplicative increase, upon observing $Y$, in the expected gain of an\nadversary in guessing a randomized function of $X$, maximized over all such\nrandomized functions. We show that maximal leakage is an upper bound on maximal\n$g$-leakage. We obtain a closed-form expression for maximal $g$-leakage for a\nclass of concave gain functions. We also study two variants of maximal\n$g$-leakage depending on the type of an adversary and obtain closed-form\nexpressions for them, which do not depend on the particular gain function\nconsidered as long as it satisfies some mild regularity conditions. We do this\nby developing a variational characterization for the R\\'{e}nyi divergence of\norder infinity which naturally generalizes the definition of pointwise maximal\nleakage to incorporate arbitrary gain functions. Finally, we study information\nleakage in the scenario where an adversary can make multiple guesses by\nfocusing on maximizing a specific gain function related to $\\alpha$-loss. In\nparticular, we first completely characterize the minimal expected $\\alpha$-loss\nunder multiple guesses and analyze how the corresponding leakage measure is\naffected with the number of guesses. We also show that a new measure of\ndivergence that belongs to the class of Bregman divergences captures the\nrelative performance of an arbitrary adversarial strategy with respect to an\noptimal strategy in minimizing the expected $\\alpha$-loss.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we present a hierarchical scheme to detect cyber-attacks in a\nhierarchical control architecture for large-scale interconnected systems (LSS).\nWe consider the LSS as a network of physically coupled subsystems, equipped\nwith a two-layer controller: on the local level, decentralized controllers\nguarantee overall stability and reference tracking; on the supervisory level, a\ncentralized coordinator sets references for the local regulators. We present a\nscheme to detect attacks that occur at the local level, with malicious agents\ncapable of affecting the local control. The detection scheme is computed at the\nsupervisory level, requiring only limited exchange of data and model knowledge.\nWe offer detailed theoretical analysis of the proposed scheme, highlighting its\ndetection properties in terms of robustness, detectability and stealthiness\nconditions.",

    "abstract": "We tackle the problem of modeling light scattering in homogeneous translucent\nmaterial and estimating its scattering parameters. A scattering phase function\nis one of such parameters which affects the distribution of scattered\nradiation. It is the most complex and challenging parameter to be modeled in\npractice, and empirical phase functions are usually used. Empirical phase\nfunctions (such as Henyey-Greenstein (HG) phase function or its modified ones)\nare usually presented and limited to a specific range of scattering materials.\nThis limitation raises concern for an inverse rendering problem where the\ntarget material is generally unknown. In such a situation, a more general phase\nfunction is preferred. Although there exists such a general phase function in\nthe polynomial form using a basis such as Legendre polynomials\n\\cite{Fowler1983}, inverse rendering with this phase function is not\nstraightforward. This is because the base polynomials may be negative\nsomewhere, while a phase function cannot. This research presents a novel\ngeneral phase function that can avoid this issue and an inverse rendering\napplication using this phase function. The proposed phase function was\npositively evaluated with a wide range of materials modeled with Mie scattering\ntheory. The scattering parameters estimation with the proposed phase function\nwas evaluated with simulation and real-world experiments.",

A typical dilemma is: in order to provide complex\nintelligent services (e.g. smart city), we need inference results of multiple\nML models, but the cost budget (e.g. GPU memory) is not enough to run all of\nthem. In this work, we study underlying relationships among black-box ML models\nand propose a novel learning task: model linking, which aims to bridge the\nknowledge of different black-box models by learning mappings (dubbed model\nlinks) between their output spaces. We propose the design of model links which\nsupports linking heterogeneous black-box ML models.

Based on our proposed model links, we developed a\nscheduling algorithm, named MLink. Through collaborative multi-model inference\nenabled by model links, MLink can improve the accuracy of obtained inference\nresults under the cost budget. We evaluated MLink on a multi-modal dataset with\nseven different ML models and two real-world video analytics systems with six\nML models and 3,264 hours of video. Experimental results show that our proposed\nmodel links can be effectively built among various black-box models.

Existing models usually control the generation process by soft\nconstraints (e.g.,~aspect planning).

In this paper, we propose UCEpic, an\nexplanation generation model that unifies aspect planning and lexical\nconstraints for controllable personalized generation. Specifically, we first\npre-train a non-personalized text generator by our proposed robust insertion\nprocess so that the model is able to generate sentences containing lexical\nconstraints. Then, we demonstrate the method of incorporating aspect planning\nand personalized references into the insertion process to obtain personalized\nexplanations. Compared to previous work controlled by soft constraints, UCEpic\nincorporates specific information from keyphrases and then largely improves the\ndiversity and informativeness of generated explanations.

    "abstract": "Choosing hardware for theorem proving is no simple task: automated provers\nare highly complex and optimized programs, often utilizing a parallel\ncomputation model, and there is little prior research on the hardware impact on\nprover performance. To alleviate the problem for Isabelle, we initiated a\ncommunity benchmark where the build time of HOL-Analysis is measured. On $54$\ndistinct CPUs, a total of $669$ runs with different Isabelle configurations\nwere reported by Isabelle users. Results range from $107$s to over $11$h. We\nfound that current consumer CPUs performed best, with an optimal number of $8$\nto $16$ threads, largely independent of heap memory. As for hardware\nparameters, CPU base clock affected multi-threaded execution most with a linear\ncorrelation of $0.37$, whereas boost frequency was the most influential\nparameter for single-threaded runs (correlation coefficient $0.55$); cache size\nplayed no significant role. When comparing our benchmark scores with popular\nhigh-performance computing benchmarks, we found a strong linear relationship\nwith Dolfyn ($R^2 = 0.79$) in the single-threaded scenario. Using data from the\n3DMark CPU Profile consumer benchmark, we created a linear model for optimal\n(multi-threaded) Isabelle performance. When validating, the model has an\naverage $R^2$-score of $0.87$; the mean absolute error in the final model\ncorresponds to a wall-clock time of $46.6$s.

    "title": "SmartMocap: Joint Estimation of Human and Camera Motion using  Uncalibrated RGB Cameras",
    "abstract": "Markerless human motion capture (mocap) from multiple RGB cameras is a widely\nstudied problem. Existing methods either need calibrated cameras or calibrate\nthem relative to a static camera, which acts as the reference frame for the\nmocap system. The calibration step has to be done a priori for every capture\nsession, which is a tedious process, and re-calibration is required whenever\ncameras are intentionally or accidentally moved. In this paper, we propose a\nmocap method which uses multiple static and moving extrinsically uncalibrated\nRGB cameras. The key components of our method are as follows. First, since the\ncameras and the subject can move freely, we select the ground plane as a common\nreference to represent both the body and the camera motions unlike existing\nmethods which represent bodies in the camera coordinate. Second, we learn a\nprobability distribution of short human motion sequences ($\\sim$1sec) relative\nto the ground plane and leverage it to disambiguate between the camera and\nhuman motion. Third, we use this distribution as a motion prior in a novel\nmulti-stage optimization approach to fit the SMPL human body model and the\ncamera poses to the human body keypoints on the images. Finally, we show that\nour method can work on a variety of datasets ranging from aerial cameras to\nsmartphones. It also gives more accurate results compared to the\nstate-of-the-art on the task of monocular human mocap with a static camera.

    "abstract": "Funding agencies are largely relied on a topic matching between domain\nexperts and research proposals to assign proposal reviewers. As proposals are\nincreasingly interdisciplinary, it is challenging to profile the\ninterdisciplinary nature of a proposal, and, thereafter, find expert reviewers\nwith an appropriate set of expertise. An essential step in solving this\nchallenge is to accurately model and classify the interdisciplinary labels of a\nproposal. Existing methodological and application-related literature, such as\ntextual classification and proposal classification, are insufficient in jointly\naddressing the three key unique issues introduced by interdisciplinary proposal\ndata: 1) the hierarchical structure of discipline labels of a proposal from\ncoarse-grain to fine-grain, e.g., from information science to AI to\nfundamentals of AI. 2) the heterogeneous semantics of various main textual\nparts that play different roles in a proposal; 3) the number of proposals is\nimbalanced between non-interdisciplinary and interdisciplinary research. Can we\nsimultaneously address the three issues in understanding the proposal's\ninterdisciplinary nature? In response to this question, we propose a\nhierarchical mixup multiple-label classification framework, which we called\nH-MixUp. H-MixUp leverages a transformer-based semantic information extractor\nand a GCN-based interdisciplinary knowledge extractor for the first and second\nissues. H-MixUp develops a fused training method of Wold-level MixUp,\nWord-level CutMix, Manifold MixUp, and Document-level MixUp to address the\nthird issue.",

    "abstract": "Groundwater level prediction is an applied time series forecasting task with\nimportant social impacts to optimize water management as well as preventing\nsome natural disasters: for instance, floods or severe droughts. Machine\nlearning methods have been reported in the literature to achieve this task, but\nthey are only focused on the forecast of the groundwater level at a single\nlocation. A global forecasting method aims at exploiting the groundwater level\ntime series from a wide range of locations to produce predictions at a single\nplace or at several places at a time. Given the recent success of global\nforecasting methods in prestigious competitions, it is meaningful to assess\nthem on groundwater level prediction and see how they are compared to local\nmethods. In this work, we created a dataset of 1026 groundwater level time\nseries. Each time series is made of daily measurements of groundwater levels\nand two exogenous variables, rainfall and evapotranspiration. This dataset is\nmade available to the communities for reproducibility and further evaluation.\nTo identify the best configuration to effectively predict groundwater level for\nthe complete set of time series, we compared different predictors including\nlocal and global time series forecasting methods. We assessed the impact of\nexogenous variables. Our result analysis shows that the best predictions are\nobtained by training a global method on past groundwater levels and rainfall\ndata.",

    "title": "Attention Spiking Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Benefiting from the event-driven and sparse spiking characteristics of the\nbrain, spiking neural networks (SNNs) are becoming an energy-efficient\nalternative to artificial neural networks (ANNs). However, the performance gap\nbetween SNNs and ANNs has been a great hindrance to deploying SNNs ubiquitously\nfor a long time. To leverage the full potential of SNNs, we study the effect of\nattention mechanisms in SNNs. We first present our idea of attention with a\nplug-and-play kit, termed the Multi-dimensional Attention (MA). Then, a new\nattention SNN architecture with end-to-end training called \"MA-SNN\" is\nproposed, which infers attention weights along the temporal, channel, as well\nas spatial dimensions separately or simultaneously. Based on the existing\nneuroscience theories, we exploit the attention weights to optimize membrane\npotentials, which in turn regulate the spiking response in a data-dependent\nway. At the cost of negligible additional parameters, MA facilitates vanilla\nSNNs to achieve sparser spiking activity, better performance, and energy\nefficiency concurrently. Experiments are conducted in event-based DVS128\nGesture/Gait action recognition and ImageNet-1k image classification. On\nGesture/Gait, the spike counts are reduced by 84.9%/81.6%, and the task\naccuracy and energy efficiency are improved by 5.9%/4.7% and\n3.4$\\times$/3.2$\\times$. On ImageNet-1K, we achieve top-1 accuracy of 75.92%\nand 77.08% on single/4-step Res-SNN-104, which are state-of-the-art results in\nSNNs. To our best knowledge, this is for the first time, that the SNN community\nachieves comparable or even better performance compared with its ANN\ncounterpart in the large-scale dataset. Our work lights up SNN's potential as a\ngeneral backbone to support various applications for SNNs, with a great balance\nbetween effectiveness and efficiency.",

    "title": "DPNet: Dual-Path Network for Real-time Object Detection with Lightweight  Attention",
    "abstract": "The recent advances of compressing high-accuracy convolution neural networks\n(CNNs) have witnessed remarkable progress for real-time object detection. To\naccelerate detection speed, lightweight detectors always have few convolution\nlayers using single-path backbone. Single-path architecture, however, involves\ncontinuous pooling and downsampling operations, always resulting in coarse and\ninaccurate feature maps that are disadvantageous to locate objects. On the\nother hand, due to limited network capacity, recent lightweight networks are\noften weak in representing large scale visual data. To address these problems,\nthis paper presents a dual-path network, named DPNet, with a lightweight\nattention scheme for real-time object detection. The dual-path architecture\nenables us to parallelly extract high-level semantic features and low-level\nobject details. Although DPNet has nearly duplicated shape with respect to\nsingle-path detectors, the computational costs and model size are not\nsignificantly increased. To enhance representation capability, a lightweight\nself-correlation module (LSCM) is designed to capture global interactions, with\nonly few computational overheads and network parameters. In neck, LSCM is\nextended into a lightweight crosscorrelation module (LCCM), capturing mutual\ndependencies among neighboring scale features. We have conducted exhaustive\nexperiments on MS COCO and Pascal VOC 2007 datasets. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that DPNet achieves state-of the-art trade-off between detection\naccuracy and implementation efficiency. Specifically, DPNet achieves 30.5% AP\non MS COCO test-dev and 81.5% mAP on Pascal VOC 2007 test set, together mwith\nnearly 2.5M model size, 1.04 GFLOPs, and 164 FPS and 196 FPS for 320 x 320\ninput images of two datasets.",

    "title": "Towards Multilingual Transitivity and Bidirectional Multilingual  Agreement for Multilingual Document-level Machine Translation",
    "abstract": "Multilingual machine translation has been proven an effective strategy to\nsupport translation between multiple languages with a single model. However,\nmost studies focus on multilingual sentence translation without considering\ngenerating long documents across different languages, which requires an\nunderstanding of multilingual context dependency and is typically harder. In\nthis paper, we first spot that naively incorporating auxiliary multilingual\ndata either auxiliary-target or source-auxiliary brings no improvement to the\nsource-target language pair in our interest. Motivated by this observation, we\npropose a novel framework called Multilingual Transitivity (MTrans) to find an\nimplicit optimal route via source-auxiliary-target within the multilingual\nmodel. To encourage MTrans, we propose a novel method called Triplet Parallel\nData (TPD), which uses parallel triplets that contain (source-auxiliary,\nauxiliary-target, and source-target) for training. The auxiliary language then\nserves as a pivot and automatically facilitates the implicit information\ntransition flow which is easier to translate. We further propose a novel\nframework called Bidirectional Multilingual Agreement (Bi-MAgree) that\nencourages the bidirectional agreement between different languages. To\nencourage Bi-MAgree, we propose a novel method called Multilingual\nKullback-Leibler Divergence (MKL) that forces the output distribution of the\ninputs with the same meaning but in different languages to be consistent with\neach other. The experimental results indicate that our methods bring consistent\nimprovements over strong baselines on three document translation tasks:\nIWSLT2015 Zh-En, De-En, and Vi-En. Our analysis validates the usefulness and\nexistence of MTrans and Bi-MAgree, and our frameworks and methods are effective\non synthetic auxiliary data.",

One main\nobstacle lies in the high-dimensional outputs in object-level visual tasks. In\nthis paper, we propose an object-centric vision framework, Obj2Seq. Obj2Seq\ntakes objects as basic units, and regards most object-level visual tasks as\nsequence generation problems of objects. Therefore, these visual tasks can be\ndecoupled into two steps. First recognize objects of given categories, and then\ngenerate a sequence for each of these objects. The definition of the output\nsequences varies for different tasks, and the model is supervised by matching\nthese sequences with ground-truth targets. Obj2Seq is able to flexibly\ndetermine input categories to satisfy customized requirements, and be easily\nextended to different visual tasks. When experimenting on MS COCO, Obj2Seq\nachieves 45.7% AP on object detection, 89.0% AP on multi-label classification\nand 65.0% AP on human pose estimation.

Previous ratings of technical\nand objective aspects showed that available schemes all have strengths and\nlimitations. Yet, the security of authentication also relies on user\nperceptions which affect acceptance and user behaviour and can deviate from\ntechnical aspects. To shine light on the issue and support researchers,\ndevelopers, and service-providers confronted with authentication choice, we\nconducted an in-depth analysis of user perceptions of the password,\nfingerprint, and a smartphone-based scheme in an online study with 201\nparticipants. As authentication is a secondary task that needs to be evaluated\nin the context of authentication purpose, we also compared perceptions across\nfour contexts of use with varying sensitivity levels: email accounts, online\nbanking, social networks, and smart homes. The results revealed how perceptions\nof usability, security, privacy, trust, effort, and qualitative features of the\nschemes are related to user preferences.

    "abstract": "Multimodal transformer exhibits high capacity and flexibility to align image\nand text for visual grounding. However, the encoder-only grounding framework\n(e.g., TransVG) suffers from heavy computation due to the self-attention\noperation with quadratic time complexity. To address this issue, we present a\nnew multimodal transformer architecture, coined as Dynamic MDETR, by decoupling\nthe whole grounding process into encoding and decoding phases. The key\nobservation is that there exists high spatial redundancy in images. Thus, we\ndevise a new dynamic multimodal transformer decoder by exploiting this sparsity\nprior to speed up the visual grounding process. Specifically, our dynamic\ndecoder is composed of a 2D adaptive sampling module and a text-guided decoding\nmodule. The sampling module aims to select these informative patches by\npredicting the offsets with respect to a reference point, while the decoding\nmodule works for extracting the grounded object information by performing cross\nattention between image features and text features. These two modules are\nstacked alternatively to gradually bridge the modality gap and iteratively\nrefine the reference point of grounded object, eventually realizing the\nobjective of visual grounding. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks\ndemonstrate that our proposed Dynamic MDETR achieves competitive trade-offs\nbetween computation and accuracy. Notably, using only 9% feature points in the\ndecoder, we can reduce ~44% GLOPs of the multimodal transformer, but still get\nhigher accuracy than the encoder-only counterpart. In addition, to verify its\ngeneralization ability and scale up our Dynamic MDETR, we build the first\none-stage CLIP empowered visual grounding framework, and achieve the\nstate-of-the-art performance on these benchmarks.",

The core principle of GCL is to reduce the distance\nbetween samples in the positive view, but increase the distance between samples\nin the negative view. While achieving promising performances, current GCL\nmethods still suffer from two limitations: (1) uncontrollable validity of\naugmentation, that graph perturbation may produce invalid views against\nsemantics and feature-topology correspondence of graph data; and (2) unreliable\nbinary contrastive justification, that the positiveness and negativeness of the\nconstructed views are difficult to be determined for non-euclidean graph data.\nTo tackle the above limitations, we propose a new contrastive learning paradigm\nfor graphs, namely Graph Soft-Contrastive Learning (GSCL), that conducts\ncontrastive learning in a finer-granularity via ranking neighborhoods without\nany augmentations and binary contrastive justification. GSCL is built upon the\nfundamental assumption of graph proximity that connected neighbors are more\nsimilar than far-distant nodes. Specifically, we develop pair-wise and\nlist-wise Gated Ranking infoNCE Loss functions to preserve the relative ranking\nrelationship in the neighborhood. Moreover, as the neighborhood size\nexponentially expands with more hops considered, we propose neighborhood\nsampling strategies to improve learning efficiency.

Especially after the availability of\nadvanced technologies that increase the number of hacking tools and increase\nthe risk impact of an attack. The problem of any anomaly-based model is its\nhigh false-positive rate. The high false-positive rate is the reason why\nanomaly IDS is not commonly applied in practice. Because anomaly-based models\nclassify an unseen pattern as a threat where it may be normal but not included\nin the training dataset. This type of problem is called overfitting where the\nmodel is not able to generalize. Optimizing Anomaly-based models by having a\nbig training dataset that includes all possible normal cases may be an optimal\nsolution but could not be applied in practice. Although we can increase the\nnumber of training samples to include much more normal cases, still we need a\nmodel that has more ability to generalize. In this research paper, we propose\napplying deep model instead of traditional models because it has more ability\nto generalize. Thus, we will obtain less false-positive by using big data and\ndeep model. We made a comparison between machine learning and deep learning\nalgorithms in the optimization of anomaly-based IDS by decreasing the\nfalse-positive rate.

    "abstract": "Policy-gradient methods are widely used for learning control policies. They\ncan be easily distributed to multiple workers and reach state-of-the-art\nresults in many domains. Unfortunately, they exhibit large variance and\nsubsequently suffer from high-sample complexity since they aggregate gradients\nover entire trajectories. At the other extreme, planning methods, like tree\nsearch, optimize the policy using single-step transitions that consider future\nlookahead. These approaches have been mainly considered for value-based\nalgorithms. Planning-based algorithms require a forward model and are\ncomputationally intensive at each step, but are more sample efficient. In this\nwork, we introduce SoftTreeMax, the first approach that integrates tree-search\ninto policy gradient. Traditionally, gradients are computed for single\nstate-action pairs. Instead, our tree-based policy structure leverages all\ngradients at the tree leaves in each environment step. This allows us to reduce\nthe variance of gradients by three orders of magnitude and to benefit from\nbetter sample complexity compared with standard policy gradient. On Atari,\nSoftTreeMax demonstrates up to 5x better performance in faster run-time\ncompared with distributed PPO.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, implicit surface representations through neural networks\nthat encode the signed distance have gained popularity and have achieved\nstate-of-the-art results in various tasks (e.g. shape representation, shape\nreconstruction, and learning shape priors). However, in contrast to\nconventional shape representations such as polygon meshes, the implicit\nrepresentations cannot be easily edited and existing works that attempt to\naddress this problem are extremely limited. In this work, we propose the first\nmethod for efficient interactive editing of signed distance functions expressed\nthrough neural networks, allowing free-form editing. Inspired by 3D sculpting\nsoftware for meshes, we use a brush-based framework that is intuitive and can\nin the future be used by sculptors and digital artists. In order to localize\nthe desired surface deformations, we regulate the network by using a copy of it\nto sample the previously expressed surface. We introduce a novel framework for\nsimulating sculpting-style surface edits, in conjunction with interactive\nsurface sampling and efficient adaptation of network weights. We qualitatively\nand quantitatively evaluate our method in various different 3D objects and\nunder many different edits. The reported results clearly show that our method\nyields high accuracy, in terms of achieving the desired edits, while at the\nsame time preserving the geometry outside the interaction areas.",

    "abstract": "Incorporating knowledge graphs (KGs) as side information in recommendation\nhas recently attracted considerable attention. Despite the success in general\nrecommendation scenarios, prior methods may fall short of performance\nsatisfaction for the cold-start problem in which users are associated with very\nlimited interactive information. Since the conventional methods rely on\nexploring the interaction topology, they may however fail to capture sufficient\ninformation in cold-start scenarios. To mitigate the problem, we propose a\nnovel Knowledge-aware Neural Networks with Personalized Feature Referencing\nMechanism, namely KPER. Different from most prior methods which simply enrich\nthe targets' semantics from KGs, e.g., product attributes, KPER utilizes the\nKGs as a \"semantic bridge\" to extract feature references for cold-start users\nor items. Specifically, given cold-start targets, KPER first probes\nsemantically relevant but not necessarily structurally close users or items as\nadaptive seeds for referencing features. Then a Gated Information Aggregation\nmodule is introduced to learn the combinatorial latent features for cold-start\nusers and items. Our extensive experiments over four real-world datasets show\nthat, KPER consistently outperforms all competing methods in cold-start\nscenarios, whilst maintaining superiority in general scenarios without\ncompromising overall performance, e.g., by achieving 0.81%-16.08% and\n1.01%-14.49% performance improvement across all datasets in Top-10\nrecommendation.",

    "abstract": "The development of new AUV technology increased the range of tasks that AUVs\ncan tackle and the length of their operations. As a result, AUVs are capable of\nhandling highly complex operations. However, these missions do not fit easily\ninto the traditional method of defining a mission as a series of pre-planned\nwaypoints because it is not possible to know, in advance, everything that might\noccur during the mission. This results in a gap between the operator's\nexpectations and actual operational performance. Consequently, this can create\na diminished level of trust between the operators and AUVs, resulting in\nunnecessary mission interruptions. To bridge this gap between in-mission\nrobotic behaviours and operators' expectations, this work aims to provide a\nframework to explain decisions and actions taken by an autonomous vehicle\nduring the mission, in an easy-to-understand manner. Additionally, the\nobjective is to have an autonomy-agnostic system that can be added as an\nadditional layer on top of any autonomy architecture. To make the approach\napplicable across different autonomous systems equipped with different\nautonomies, this work decouples the inner workings of the autonomy from the\ndecision points and the resulting executed actions applying Knowledge\nDistillation. Finally, to present the explanations to the operators in a more\nnatural way, the output of the distilled decision tree is combined with natural\nlanguage explanations and reported to the operators as sentences.

Online social\nmedia is becoming a great instrument for expressing emotions in written form.\nPaying attention to the context and the entire sentence help us to detect\nemotion from texts. However, this perspective inhibits us from noticing some\nemotional words or phrases in the text, particularly when the words express an\nemotion implicitly rather than explicitly. On the other hand, focusing only on\nthe words and ignoring the context results in a distorted understanding of the\nsentence meaning and feeling. In this paper, we propose a framework that\nanalyses text at both the sentence and word levels. We name it CEFER (Context\nand Emotion embedded Framework for Emotion Recognition). Our four approach\nfacets are to extracting data by considering the entire sentence and each\nindividual word simultaneously, as well as implicit and explicit emotions. The\nknowledge gained from these data not only mitigates the impact of flaws in the\npreceding approaches but also it strengthens the feature vector. We evaluate\nseveral feature spaces using BERT family and design the CEFER based on them.\nCEFER combines the emotional vector of each word, including explicit and\nimplicit emotions, with the feature vector of each word based on context. CEFER\nperforms better than the BERT family. The experimental results demonstrate that\nidentifying implicit emotions are more challenging than detecting explicit\nemotions.

Our\napproach allows the full control of the co-carrying trajectories by the person\nwhile sharing the load with multiple robots depending on the size and the\nweight of the object. This is achieved by merging the haptic information\ntransferred through the object and the human motion information obtained from a\nmotion capture system. One important advantage of the framework is that no\nstrict internal communication is required between the robots, regardless of the\nobject size and deformation characteristics. We validate the framework with two\nchallenging real-world scenarios: co-transportation of a wooden rigid closet\nand a bulky box on top of forklift moving straps, with the latter\ncharacterizing deformable objects. In order to evaluate the generalizability of\nthe proposed framework, a heterogenous team of two mobile manipulators that\nconsist of an Omni-directional mobile base and a collaborative robotic arm with\ndifferent DoFs is chosen for the experiments. The qualitative comparison\nbetween our controller and the baseline controller (i.e., an admittance\ncontroller) during these experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the\nproposed framework especially when co-carrying deformable objects. Furthermore,\nwe believe that the performance of our framework during the experiment with the\nlifting straps offers a promising solution for the co-transportation of bulky\nand ungraspable objects.",

The work in\nthis paper designs and implements a hash-based ensemble approach for ML\nrobustness and evaluates its applicability and performance on random forests, a\nmachine learning model proved to be more resistant to poisoning attempts on\ntabular datasets. An extensive experimental evaluation is carried out to\nevaluate the robustness of our approach against a variety of attacks, and\ncompare it with a traditional monolithic model based on random forests.",

    "abstract": "The large number of recent JEDEC DRAM standard releases and their increasing\nfeature set makes it difficult for designers to rapidly upgrade the memory\ncontroller IPs to each new standard. Especially the hardware verification is\nchallenging due to the higher protocol complexity of standards like DDR5,\nLPDDR5 or HBM3 in comparison with their predecessors. With traditional\nsimulation-based verification it is laborious to guarantee the coverage of all\npossible states, especially for control flow rich memory controllers. This has\na direct impact on the time-to-market. A promising alternative is formal\nverification because it allows to ensure protocol compliance based on\nmathematical proofs. However, with regard to memory controllers no\nfully-automated verification process has been presented in the state-of-the-art\nyet, which means there is still a potential risk of human error. In this paper\nwe present a framework that automatically generates SystemVerilog Assertions\nfor a DRAM protocol.

Current state-of-the-art methods typically use convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) to predict motion information, such as motion keypoints\nand corresponding local transformations. However, these CNN based methods do\nnot explicitly model the interactions between motions; as a result, the\nimportant underlying motion relationship may be neglected, which can\npotentially lead to noticeable artifacts being produced in the generated\nanimation video. To this end, we propose a new method, the motion transformer,\nwhich is the first attempt to build a motion estimator based on a vision\ntransformer. More specifically, we introduce two types of tokens in our\nproposed method: i) image tokens formed from patch features and corresponding\nposition encoding; and ii) motion tokens encoded with motion information. Both\ntypes of tokens are sent into vision transformers to promote underlying\ninteractions between them through multi-head self attention blocks. By adopting\nthis process, the motion information can be better learned to boost the model\nperformance. The final embedded motion tokens are then used to predict the\ncorresponding motion keypoints and local transformations.

In this\npaper, we propose a refutation-based formal verification approach for analyzing\nStateflow models against invariant properties, based on bounded model checking\n(BMC). The crux of our technique is: i) a representation of the state space of\nStateflow models as a symbolic transition system (STS) over the symbolic\nconfigurations of the model, and ii) application of incremental BMC, to\ngenerate verification results after each unrolling of the next-state relation\nof the transition system. To this end, we develop a symbolic structural\noperational semantics (SSOS) for Stateflow, starting from an existing\nstructural operational semantics (SOS), and show the preservation of invariant\nproperties between the two. We define bounded invariant checking for STS over\nsymbolic configurations as a satisfiability problem. We develop an automated\nprocedure for generating the initial and next-state predicates of the STS, and\na prototype implementation of the technique in the form of a tool utilising\nstandard, off-the-shelf satisfiability solvers.

Writing correct monitors can itself be\ncomplex, and errors in the monitoring subsystem threaten the mission as a\nwhole. This paper provides an overview of a formal approach to generating\nruntime monitors for autonomous robots from requirements written in a\nstructured natural language. Our approach integrates the Formal Requirement\nElicitation Tool (FRET) with Copilot, a runtime verification framework, through\nthe Ogma integration tool. FRET is used to specify requirements with\nunambiguous semantics, which are then automatically translated into temporal\nlogic formulae. Ogma generates monitor specifications from the FRET output,\nwhich are compiled into hard-real time C99. To facilitate integration of the\nmonitors in ROS2, we have extended Ogma to generate ROS2 packages defining\nmonitoring nodes, which run the monitors when new data becomes available, and\npublish the results of any violations.

The main advantage is that no manual modeling effort\nis required since a behavioral model is automatically inferred from a black-box\nsystem. However, several real-world applications of this technique show that\nthe overhead for the establishment of an active interface might hamper the\npractical applicability. Our recent work on the active learning of Bluetooth\nLow Energy (BLE) protocol found that the active interaction creates a\nbottleneck during learning. Considering the automata learning toolset, passive\nlearning techniques appear as a promising solution since they do not require an\nactive interface to the system under learning. Instead, models are learned\nbased on a given data set. In this paper, we evaluate passive learning for two\nnetwork protocols: BLE and Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT). Our\nresults show that passive techniques can correctly learn with less data than\nrequired by active learning.

    "abstract": "This 'research preview' paper introduces an adaptive path planning framework\nfor robotic mission execution in assistive-care applications. The framework\nprovides a graph-based environment modelling approach, with dynamic path\nfinding performed using Dijkstra's algorithm. A predictive module that uses\nprobabilistic model checking is applied to estimate the human's movement\nthrough the environment, allowing run-time re-planning of the robot's path. We\nillustrate the use of the framework for a simulated assistive-care case study\nin which a mobile robot navigates through the environment and monitors an end\nuser with mild physical or cognitive impairments.",

The safety and security properties monitored are,\nin turn, derived from the hierarchical decomposition of RVAFTs.

Existing methods mainly extract the text information from only\none sentence to represent an image and the text representation effects the\nquality of the generated image well. However, directly utilizing the limited\ninformation in one sentence misses some key attribute descriptions, which are\nthe crucial factors to describe an image accurately. To alleviate the above\nproblem, we propose an effective text representation method with the\ncomplements of attribute information. Firstly, we construct an attribute memory\nto jointly control the text-to-image generation with sentence input. Secondly,\nwe explore two update mechanisms, sample-aware and sample-joint mechanisms, to\ndynamically optimize a generalized attribute memory. Furthermore, we design an\nattribute-sentence-joint conditional generator learning scheme to align the\nfeature embeddings among multiple representations, which promotes the\ncross-modal network training. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed\nmethod obtains substantial performance improvements on both the CUB (FID from\n14.81 to 8.57) and COCO (FID from 21.42 to 12.39) datasets.",

In this paper, the fundamental problem\nfor the complex WTC is whether the proper signal is optimal has yet to be given\nexplicit proof, though previous work implicitly assumed the complex signal was\nproper. Thus, a determinant inequality is proposed to prove that the secrecy\nrate of a complex Gaussian signal with a fixed covariance matrix in a degraded\ncomplex WTC is maximized if and only if the signal is proper, i.e., the\npseudo-covariance matrix is a zero matrix. Moreover, based on the result of the\ndegraded complex WTC and the min-max reformulation of the secrecy capacity, the\noptimality of the proper signal in the general complex WTC is also revealed.\nThe results of this research complement the current research on complex WTC. To\nbe more specific, we have shown it is sufficient to focus on the proper signal\nwhen studying the secrecy capacity of the complex WTC.",

However, there is no\nguarantee that it will always be possible to obtain sufficient extra data for a\nselected dataset.

The\nproposed method can achieve increased adversarial robustness on a primary\ndataset by leveraging auxiliary datasets via multi-domain learning.\nSpecifically, data amplification on both robust and non-robust features can be\naccomplished through the application of BiaMAT as demonstrated through a\ntheoretical and empirical analysis. Moreover, we demonstrate that while\nexisting methods are vulnerable to negative transfer due to the distributional\ndiscrepancy between auxiliary and primary data, the proposed method enables\nneural networks to flexibly leverage diverse image datasets for adversarial\ntraining by successfully handling the domain discrepancy through the\napplication of a confidence-based selection strategy.

    "abstract": "This work proposes a novel reconfigurable architecture for low latency Graph\nNeural Network (GNN) design specifically for particle detectors. Accelerating\nGNNs for particle detectors is challenging since it requires sub-microsecond\nlatency to deploy the networks for online event selection in the Level-1\ntriggers at the CERN Large Hadron Collider experiments. This paper proposes a\ncustom code transformation with strength reduction for the matrix\nmultiplication operations in the interaction-network based GNNs with fully\nconnected graphs, which avoids the costly multiplication. It exploits sparsity\npatterns as well as binary adjacency matrices, and avoids irregular memory\naccess, leading to a reduction in latency and improvement in hardware\nefficiency. In addition, we introduce an outer-product based matrix\nmultiplication approach which is enhanced by the strength reduction for low\nlatency design. Also, a fusion step is introduced to further reduce the design\nlatency. Furthermore, an GNN-specific algorithm-hardware co-design approach is\npresented which not only finds a design with a much better latency but also\nfinds a high accuracy design under a given latency constraint. Finally, a\ncustomizable template for this low latency GNN hardware architecture has been\ndesigned and open-sourced, which enables the generation of low-latency FPGA\ndesigns with efficient resource utilization using a high-level synthesis tool.\nEvaluation results show that our FPGA implementation is up to 24 times faster\nand consumes up to 45 times less power than a GPU implementation. Compared to\nour previous FPGA implementations, this work achieves 6.51 to 16.7 times lower\nlatency. Moreover, the latency of our FPGA design is sufficiently low to enable\ndeployment of GNNs in a sub-microsecond, real-time collider trigger system,\nenabling it to benefit from improved accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning has recently achieved remarkable success in many domains\nincluding graphs. However contrastive loss, especially for graphs, requires a\nlarge number of negative samples which is unscalable and computationally\nprohibitive with a quadratic time complexity. Sub-sampling is not optimal and\nincorrect negative sampling leads to sampling bias. In this work, we propose a\nmeta-node based approximation technique that can (a) proxy all negative\ncombinations (b) in quadratic cluster size time complexity, (c) at graph level,\nnot node level, and (d) exploit graph sparsity. By replacing node-pairs with\nadditive cluster-pairs, we compute the negatives in cluster-time at graph\nlevel. The resulting Proxy approximated meta-node Contrastive (PamC) loss,\nbased on simple optimized GPU operations, captures the full set of negatives,\nyet is efficient with a linear time complexity. By avoiding sampling, we\neffectively eliminate sample bias. We meet the criterion for larger number of\nsamples, thus achieving block-contrastiveness, which is proven to outperform\npair-wise losses. We use learnt soft cluster assignments for the meta-node\nconstriction, and avoid possible heterophily and noise added during edge\ncreation. Theoretically, we show that real world graphs easily satisfy\nconditions necessary for our approximation. Empirically, we show promising\naccuracy gains over state-of-the-art graph clustering on 6 benchmarks.\nImportantly, we gain substantially in efficiency; up to 3x in training time,\n1.8x in inference time and over 5x in GPU memory reduction.",

To this end,we successfully build\nthe first city-scale incremental neural mapping system with a panoptic\nrepresentation that consists of both environment-level and instance-level\nmodelling. Given a stream of sparse LiDAR point cloud, it maintains a dynamic\ngenerative model that maps 3D coordinates to signed distance field (SDF)\nvalues. To address the difficulty of representing geometric information at\ndifferent levels in city-scale space, we propose a tailored three-layer\nsampling strategy to dynamically sample the global, local and near-surface\ndomains. Meanwhile, to realize high fidelity mapping, category-specific prior\nis introduced to better model the geometric details, leading to a panoptic\nrepresentation. We evaluate on the public SemanticKITTI dataset and demonstrate\nthe significance of the newly proposed three-layer sampling strategy and\npanoptic representation, using both quantitative and qualitative results. Codes\nand data will be publicly available.",

In addition, we investigate the effect of the inclusion of\nadditional general-domain data in training from the IWSLT'16 dataset to improve\nthe Transformer model performance.

This paper presents a\nbackward reachability approach for safety verification of neural feedback loops\n(NFLs), i.e., closed-loop systems with NN control policies. While recent works\nhave focused on forward reachability as a strategy for safety certification of\nNFLs, backward reachability offers advantages over the forward strategy,\nparticularly in obstacle avoidance scenarios. Prior works have developed\ntechniques for backward reachability analysis for systems without NNs, but the\npresence of NNs in the feedback loop presents a unique set of problems due to\nthe nonlinearities in their activation functions and because NN models are\ngenerally not invertible. To overcome these challenges, we use existing forward\nNN analysis tools to efficiently find an over-approximation of the\nbackprojection (BP) set, i.e., the set of states for which the NN control\npolicy will drive the system to a given target set. We present frameworks for\ncalculating BP over-approximations for both linear and nonlinear systems with\ncontrol policies represented by feedforward NNs and propose computationally\nefficient strategies.

On the other hand, motivated by applications\nin dynamic maximal matching, we obtain a different trade-off, namely the\nimproved worst case update time of $O(\\log n \\log \\alpha)$ for the problem of\nmaintaining an edge-orientation with at most $O(\\alpha + \\log n)$ out-edges per\nvertex. Since our algorithms have update times with worst-case guarantees, the\nnumber of changes to the solution (i.e. the recourse) is naturally limited.\nOur algorithms make choices based entirely on local information, which makes\nthem automatically adaptive to the current arboricity of the graph. In other\nwords, they are arboricity-oblivious, while they are arboricity-sensitive. This\nboth simplifies and improves upon previous work, by having fewer assumptions or\nbetter asymptotic guarantees.\nAs a consequence, one obtains an algorithm with improved efficiency for\nmaintaining a $(1+\\varepsilon)$ approximation of the maximum subgraph density,\nand an algorithm for dynamic maximal matching whose worst-case update time is\nguaranteed to be upper bounded by $O(\\alpha + \\log n\\log \\alpha)$, where\n$\\alpha$ is the arboricity at the time of the update.",

    "title": "Exploring the Relationship between Architecture and Adversarially Robust  Generalization",
    "abstract": "Adversarial training has been demonstrated to be one of the most effective\nremedies for defending adversarial examples, yet it often suffers from the huge\nrobustness generalization gap on unseen testing adversaries, deemed as the\n\\emph{adversarially robust generalization problem}. Despite the preliminary\nunderstandings devoted on adversarially robust generalization, little is known\nfrom the architectural perspective. Thus, this paper tries to bridge the gap by\nsystematically examining the most representative architectures (e.g., Vision\nTransformers and CNNs). In particular, we first comprehensively evaluated\n\\emph{20} adversarially trained architectures on ImageNette and CIFAR-10\ndatasets towards several adversaries (multiple $\\ell_p$-norm adversarial\nattacks), and found that Vision Transformers (e.g., PVT, CoAtNet) often yield\nbetter adversarially robust generalization. To further understand what\narchitectural ingredients favor adversarially robust generalization, we delve\ninto several key building blocks and revealed the fact via the lens of\nRademacher complexity that the higher weight sparsity contributes significantly\ntowards the better adversarially robust generalization of Vision Transformers,\nwhich can be often achieved by attention layers. Our extensive studies\ndiscovered the close relationship between architectural design and\nadversarially robust generalization, and instantiated several important\ninsights. We hope our findings could help to better understand the mechanism\ntowards designing robust deep learning architectures.",

    "abstract": "In intelligent manufacturing, the quality of machine translation engineering\ndrawings will directly affect its manufacturing accuracy. Currently, most of\nthe work is manually translated, greatly reducing production efficiency. This\npaper proposes an automatic translation method for welded structural\nengineering drawings based on Cyclic Generative Adversarial Networks\n(CycleGAN). The CycleGAN network model of unpaired transfer learning is used to\nlearn the feature mapping of real welding engineering drawings to realize\nautomatic translation of engineering drawings. U-Net and PatchGAN are the main\nnetwork for the generator and discriminator, respectively. Based on removing\nthe identity mapping function, a high-dimensional sparse network is proposed to\nreplace the traditional dense network for the Cyclegan generator to improve\nnoise robustness. Increase the residual block hidden layer to increase the\nresolution of the generated graph. The improved and fine-tuned network models\nare experimentally validated, computing the gap between real and generated\ndata. It meets the welding engineering precision standard and solves the main\nproblem of low drawing recognition efficiency in the welding manufacturing\nprocess. The results show. After training with our model, the PSNR, SSIM and\nMSE of welding engineering drawings reach about 44.89%, 99.58% and 2.11,\nrespectively, which are superior to traditional networks in both training speed\nand accuracy.",

    "title": "Debiasing Graph Neural Networks via Learning Disentangled Causal  Substructure",
    "abstract": "Most Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) predict the labels of unseen graphs by\nlearning the correlation between the input graphs and labels. However, by\npresenting a graph classification investigation on the training graphs with\nsevere bias, surprisingly, we discover that GNNs always tend to explore the\nspurious correlations to make decision, even if the causal correlation always\nexists. This implies that existing GNNs trained on such biased datasets will\nsuffer from poor generalization capability. By analyzing this problem in a\ncausal view, we find that disentangling and decorrelating the causal and bias\nlatent variables from the biased graphs are both crucial for debiasing.\nInspiring by this, we propose a general disentangled GNN framework to learn the\ncausal substructure and bias substructure, respectively. Particularly, we\ndesign a parameterized edge mask generator to explicitly split the input graph\ninto causal and bias subgraphs. Then two GNN modules supervised by\ncausal/bias-aware loss functions respectively are trained to encode causal and\nbias subgraphs into their corresponding representations. With the disentangled\nrepresentations, we synthesize the counterfactual unbiased training samples to\nfurther decorrelate causal and bias variables. Moreover, to better benchmark\nthe severe bias problem, we construct three new graph datasets, which have\ncontrollable bias degrees and are easier to visualize and explain. Experimental\nresults well demonstrate that our approach achieves superior generalization\nperformance over existing baselines. Furthermore, owing to the learned edge\nmask, the proposed model has appealing interpretability and transferability.\nCode and data are available at: https://github.com/googlebaba/DisC.",

In practice, however, strategic\ninteractions -- ranging from routing problems to online advertising auctions --\nevolve dynamically, thereby leading to many similar games to be solved. To\naddress this gap, we introduce meta-learning for equilibrium finding and\nlearning to play games. We establish the first meta-learning guarantees for a\nvariety of fundamental and well-studied classes of games, including two-player\nzero-sum games, general-sum games, and Stackelberg games. In particular, we\nobtain rates of convergence to different game-theoretic equilibria that depend\non natural notions of similarity between the sequence of games encountered,\nwhile at the same time recovering the known single-game guarantees when the\nsequence of games is arbitrary. Along the way, we prove a number of new results\nin the single-game regime through a simple and unified framework, which may be\nof independent interest. Finally, we evaluate our meta-learning algorithms on\nendgames faced by the poker agent Libratus against top human professionals.

In this work, we present a framework for\nzero-shot policy retargeting wherein diverse motor skills can be transferred\nbetween robots of different shapes and sizes. The new framework centers on a\nplanning-and-control pipeline that systematically integrates RL and Model\nPredictive Control (MPC). The planning stage employs RL to generate a\ndynamically plausible trajectory as well as the contact schedule, avoiding the\ncombinatorial complexity of contact sequence optimization. This information is\nthen used to seed the MPC to stabilize and robustify the policy roll-out via a\nnew Hybrid Kinodynamic (HKD) model that implicitly optimizes the foothold\nlocations.

This asymptotically\noptimal performance cannot be extended to other settings: we prove that there\nis no non-adaptive algorithm without the knowledge of contention size $k$\nadmitting latency $o(k\\log k/(\\log\\log k)^2)$. This means, in particular, that\ncoding (even random) with acknowledgements is not very efficient on a shared\nchannel without synchronization or an estimate of the contention size.

    "abstract": "With the advances of the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G/6G wireless\ncommunications, the paradigms of mobile computing have developed dramatically\nin recent years, from centralized mobile cloud computing to distributed fog\ncomputing and mobile edge computing (MEC). MEC pushes compute-intensive\nassignments to the edge of the network and brings resources as close to the\nendpoints as possible, addressing the shortcomings of mobile devices with\nregard to storage space, resource optimisation, computational performance and\nefficiency. Compared to cloud computing, as the distributed and closer\ninfrastructure, the convergence of MEC with other emerging technologies,\nincluding the Metaverse, 6G wireless communications, artificial intelligence\n(AI), and blockchain, also solves the problems of network resource allocation,\nmore network load as well as latency requirements. Accordingly, this paper\ninvestigates the computational paradigms used to meet the stringent\nrequirements of modern applications. The application scenarios of MEC in mobile\naugmented reality (MAR) are provided. Furthermore, this survey presents the\nmotivation of MEC-based Metaverse and introduces the applications of MEC to the\nMetaverse. Particular emphasis is given on a set of technical fusions mentioned\nabove, e.g., 6G with MEC paradigm, MEC strengthened by blockchain, etc.",

In SCL, a neural network is\ntrained to optimize two objectives: pull an anchor and positive samples\ntogether in the embedding space, and push the anchor apart from the negatives.\nHowever, these two different objectives may conflict, requiring trade-offs\nbetween them during optimization. In this work, we formulate the SCL problem as\na Multi-Objective Optimization problem for the fine-tuning phase of RoBERTa\nlanguage model.

Recent data compression methods are proposed using deep\nlearning methods, which perform better than conventional methods. However,\nthese methods require a lot of data and resources for training. Furthermore, it\nis difficult to materialize these deep learning-based solutions on IoT devices\ndue to the resource-constrained nature of IoT devices.

    "abstract": "Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has been shown to learn visual\nrepresentations with great transferability, which achieves promising accuracy\nfor zero-shot classification. To further improve its downstream performance,\nexisting works propose additional learnable modules upon CLIP and fine-tune\nthem by few-shot training sets. However, the resulting extra training cost and\ndata requirement severely hinder the efficiency for model deployment and\nknowledge transfer. In this paper, we introduce a free-lunch enhancement\nmethod, CALIP, to boost CLIP's zero-shot performance via a parameter-free\nAttention module. Specifically, we guide visual and textual representations to\ninteract with each other and explore cross-modal informative features via\nattention. As the pre-training has largely reduced the embedding distances\nbetween two modalities, we discard all learnable parameters in the attention\nand bidirectionally update the multi-modal features, enabling the whole process\nto be parameter-free and training-free. In this way, the images are blended\nwith textual-aware signals and the text representations become visual-guided\nfor better adaptive zero-shot alignment. We evaluate CALIP on various\nbenchmarks of 14 datasets for both 2D image and 3D point cloud few-shot\nclassification, showing consistent zero-shot performance improvement over CLIP.\nBased on that, we further insert a small number of linear layers in CALIP's\nattention module and verify our robustness under the few-shot settings, which\nalso achieves leading performance compared to existing methods. Those extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach for efficient\nenhancement of CLIP.",

    "abstract": "5G and beyond mobile networks will support heterogeneous use cases at an\nunprecedented scale, thus demanding automated control and optimization of\nnetwork functionalities customized to the needs of individual users. Such\nfine-grained control of the Radio Access Network (RAN) is not possible with the\ncurrent cellular architecture. To fill this gap, the Open RAN paradigm and its\nspecification introduce an open architecture with abstractions that enable\nclosed-loop control and provide data-driven, and intelligent optimization of\nthe RAN at the user level. This is obtained through custom RAN control\napplications (i.e., xApps) deployed on near-real-time RAN Intelligent\nController (near-RT RIC) at the edge of the network. Despite these premises, as\nof today the research community lacks a sandbox to build data-driven xApps, and\ncreate large-scale datasets for effective AI training. In this paper, we\naddress this by introducing ns-O-RAN, a software framework that integrates a\nreal-world, production-grade near-RT RIC with a 3GPP-based simulated\nenvironment on ns-3, enabling the development of xApps and automated\nlarge-scale data collection and testing of Deep Reinforcement Learning-driven\ncontrol policies for the optimization at the user-level. In addition, we\npropose the first user-specific O-RAN Traffic Steering (TS) intelligent\nhandover framework. It uses Random Ensemble Mixture, combined with a\nstate-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network architecture, to optimally assign\na serving base station to each user in the network. Our TS xApp, trained with\nmore than 40 million data points collected by ns-O-RAN, runs on the near-RT RIC\nand controls its base stations. We evaluate the performance on a large-scale\ndeployment, showing that the xApp-based handover improves throughput and\nspectral efficiency by an average of 50% over traditional handover heuristics,\nwith less mobility overhead.",

    "abstract": "The paucity of labeled data is a typical challenge in the automotive\nindustry. Annotating time-series measurements requires solid domain knowledge\nand in-depth exploratory data analysis, which implies a high labeling effort.\nConventional Active Learning (AL) addresses this issue by actively querying the\nmost informative instances based on the estimated classification probability\nand retraining the model iteratively. However, the learning efficiency strongly\nrelies on the initial model, resulting in the trade-off between the size of the\ninitial dataset and the query number. This paper proposes a novel Few-Shot\nLearning (FSL)-based AL framework, which addresses the trade-off problem by\nincorporating a Prototypical Network (ProtoNet) in the AL iterations. The\nresults show an improvement, on the one hand, in the robustness to the initial\nmodel and, on the other hand, in the learning efficiency of the ProtoNet\nthrough the active selection of the support set in each iteration. This\nframework was validated on UCI HAR/HAPT dataset and a real-world braking\nmaneuver dataset.

Inspired by this, we propose a new convolution operator\nnamed spatial pruned sparse convolution (SPS-Conv), which includes two\nvariants, spatial pruned submanifold sparse convolution (SPSS-Conv) and spatial\npruned regular sparse convolution (SPRS-Conv), both of which are based on the\nidea of dynamically determining crucial areas for redundancy reduction. We\nvalidate that the magnitude can serve as important cues to determine crucial\nareas which get rid of the extra computations of learning-based methods. The\nproposed modules can easily be incorporated into existing sparse 3D CNNs\nwithout extra architectural modifications. Extensive experiments on the KITTI,\nWaymo and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve more than\n50% reduction in GFLOPs without compromising the performance.",

    "abstract": "Open-set semi-supervised learning (OSSL) has attracted growing interest,\nwhich investigates a more practical scenario where out-of-distribution (OOD)\nsamples are only contained in unlabeled data. Existing OSSL methods like\nOpenMatch learn an OOD detector to identify outliers, which often update all\nmodal parameters (i.e., full fine-tuning) to propagate class information from\nlabeled data to unlabeled ones. Currently, prompt learning has been developed\nto bridge gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning, which shows higher\ncomputational efficiency in several downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose\na prompt-driven efficient OSSL framework, called OpenPrompt, which can\npropagate class information from labeled to unlabeled data with only a small\nnumber of trainable parameters. We propose a prompt-driven joint space learning\nmechanism to detect OOD data by maximizing the distribution gap between ID and\nOOD samples in unlabeled data, thereby our method enables the outliers to be\ndetected in a new way. The experimental results on three public datasets show\nthat OpenPrompt outperforms state-of-the-art methods with less than 1% of\ntrainable parameters. More importantly, OpenPrompt achieves a 4% improvement in\nterms of AUROC on outlier detection over a fully supervised model on CIFAR10.",

    "abstract": "Biological and artificial agents need to deal with constant changes in the\nreal world. We study this problem in four classical continuous control\nenvironments, augmented with morphological perturbations. Learning to locomote\nwhen the length and the thickness of different body parts vary is challenging,\nas the control policy is required to adapt to the morphology to successfully\nbalance and advance the agent. We show that a control policy based on the\nproprioceptive state performs poorly with highly variable body configurations,\nwhile an (oracle) agent with access to a learned encoding of the perturbation\nperforms significantly better. We introduce DMAP, a biologically-inspired,\nattention-based policy network architecture. DMAP combines independent\nproprioceptive processing, a distributed policy with individual controllers for\neach joint, and an attention mechanism, to dynamically gate sensory information\nfrom different body parts to different controllers. Despite not having access\nto the (hidden) morphology information, DMAP can be trained end-to-end in all\nthe considered environments, overall matching or surpassing the performance of\nan oracle agent. Thus DMAP, implementing principles from biological motor\ncontrol, provides a strong inductive bias for learning challenging sensorimotor\ntasks.

On\nthe $t^{\\text{th}}$ round, a monotone reward function $f_t: 2^{[N]} \\to\n\\mathbb{R}_+,$ which assigns a non-negative reward to each subset of $[N],$ is\nrevealed to a learner. The learner selects (perhaps randomly) a subset $S_t\n\\subseteq [N]$ of $k$ elements before the reward function $f_t$ for that round\nis revealed $(k \\leq N)$. As a consequence of its choice, the learner receives\na reward of $f_t(S_t)$ on the $t^{\\text{th}}$ round. The learner's goal is to\ndesign an online subset selection policy to maximize its expected cumulative\nreward accrued over a given time horizon. In this connection, we propose an\nonline learning policy called SCore (Subset Selection with Core) that solves\nthe problem for a large class of reward functions. The proposed SCore policy is\nbased on a new concept of $\\alpha$-Core, which is a generalization of the\nnotion of Core from the cooperative game theory literature. We establish a\nlearning guarantee for the SCore policy in terms of a new performance metric\ncalled $\\alpha$-augmented regret. In this new metric, the power of the offline\nbenchmark is suitably augmented compared to the online policy. We give several\nillustrative examples to show that a broad class of reward functions, including\nsubmodular, can be efficiently learned using the SCore policy.

    "abstract": "When a business sells to another business (B2B), the buying business is\nrepresented by a group of individuals, termed account, who collectively decide\nwhether to buy. The seller advertises to each individual and interacts with\nthem, mostly by digital means. The sales cycle is long, most often over a few\nmonths. There is heterogeneity among individuals belonging to an account in\nseeking information and hence the seller needs to score the interest of each\nindividual over a long horizon to decide which individuals must be reached and\nwhen. Moreover, the buy decision rests with the account and must be scored to\nproject the likelihood of purchase, a decision that is subject to change all\nthe way up to the actual decision, emblematic of group decision making. We\nscore decision of the account and its individuals in a dynamic manner. Dynamic\nscoring allows opportunity to influence different individual members at\ndifferent time points over the long horizon. The dataset contains behavior logs\nof each individual's communication activities with the seller; but, there are\nno data on consultations among individuals which result in the decision. Using\nneural network architecture, we propose several ways to aggregate information\nfrom individual members' activities, to predict the group's collective\ndecision. Multiple evaluations find strong model performance.",

    "abstract": "Diffractive optical neural networks (DONNs) have attracted lots of attention\nas they bring significant advantages in terms of power efficiency, parallelism,\nand computational speed compared with conventional deep neural networks (DNNs),\nwhich have intrinsic limitations when implemented on digital platforms.\nHowever, inversely mapping algorithm-trained physical model parameters onto\nreal-world optical devices with discrete values is a non-trivial task as\nexisting optical devices have non-unified discrete levels and non-monotonic\nproperties. This work proposes a novel device-to-system hardware-software\ncodesign framework, which enables efficient physics-aware training of DONNs\nw.r.t arbitrary experimental measured optical devices across layers.\nSpecifically, Gumbel-Softmax is employed to enable differentiable discrete\nmapping from real-world device parameters into the forward function of DONNs,\nwhere the physical parameters in DONNs can be trained by simply minimizing the\nloss function of the ML task. The results have demonstrated that our proposed\nframework offers significant advantages over conventional quantization-based\nmethods, especially with low-precision optical devices.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of optimizing the decision of a preemptive\ntransmitter to minimize the Age of Incorrect Information (AoII) when the\nchannel has a random delay. In the system, a transmitter observes a dynamic\nsource and makes decisions based on the system status. When the channel is\nbusy, the transmitter can choose whether to preempt to transmit a new update.\nWhen the channel is idle, the transmitter can choose whether or not to transmit\na new update. We assume that the channel has a random delay and that this delay\nis independent and identically distributed for any update. At the other end of\nthe channel is a receiver that estimates the state of the dynamic source based\non the updates it receives. We adopt AoII to measure the performance of the\nsystem. Therefore, this paper aims to optimize the transmitter's action in each\ntime slot to minimize AoII. We first use the Markov decision process to\nformulate the optimization problem and give the corresponding value iterative\nalgorithm to obtain the optimal policy. However, the value iteration algorithm\nis computationally demanding, and some approximations are made to realize the\nalgorithm. Hence, we theoretically analyze some canonical delay distributions\nand obtain the corresponding optimal policies by leveraging the policy\nimprovement theorem.",

Our key insight is to improve data efficiency by\nfocusing model adaptation on only the regions where the source and target\ndynamics are similar. In the rope example, adapting the free-space dynamics\nrequires significantly fewer data than adapting the free-space dynamics while\nalso learning collision dynamics. We propose a new method for adaptation that\nis effective in adapting to regions of similar dynamics. Additionally, we\ncombine this adaptation method with prior work on planning with unreliable\ndynamics to make a method for data-efficient online adaptation, called FOCUS.\nWe first demonstrate that the proposed adaptation method achieves statistically\nsignificantly lower prediction error in regions of similar dynamics on\nsimulated rope manipulation and plant watering tasks.

    "abstract": "In the past decade, deep learning has dramatically changed the traditional\nhand-craft feature manner with strong feature learning capability, resulting in\ntremendous improvement of conventional tasks. However, deep neural networks\nhave recently been demonstrated vulnerable to adversarial examples, a kind of\nmalicious samples crafted by small elaborately designed noise, which mislead\nthe DNNs to make the wrong decisions while remaining imperceptible to humans.\nAdversarial examples can be divided into digital adversarial attacks and\nphysical adversarial attacks. The digital adversarial attack is mostly\nperformed in lab environments, focusing on improving the performance of\nadversarial attack algorithms. In contrast, the physical adversarial attack\nfocus on attacking the physical world deployed DNN systems, which is a more\nchallenging task due to the complex physical environment (i.e., brightness,\nocclusion, and so on). Although the discrepancy between digital adversarial and\nphysical adversarial examples is small, the physical adversarial examples have\na specific design to overcome the effect of the complex physical environment.\nIn this paper, we review the development of physical adversarial attacks in\nDNN-based computer vision tasks, including image recognition tasks, object\ndetection tasks, and semantic segmentation. For the sake of completeness of the\nalgorithm evolution, we will briefly introduce the works that do not involve\nthe physical adversarial attack. We first present a categorization scheme to\nsummarize the current physical adversarial attacks. Then discuss the advantages\nand disadvantages of the existing physical adversarial attacks and focus on the\ntechnique used to maintain the adversarial when applied into physical\nenvironment. Finally, we point out the issues of the current physical\nadversarial attacks to be solved and provide promising research directions.",

Our role as software researchers is to contribute\ntowards improving software sustainability and provide the software engineering\ncommunity with the tools and techniques that will improve the human, economic,\nand environmental sustainability of software development. We found that GLUX\naddresses human sustainability by empowering self-sufficient, problem-focused\nteams, building a motivating and engaging environment, and developing team\ncooperation. Economic sustainability is addressed by minimizing UX debt and\nusing gamification techniques to direct the focus of the behavior and mindset\nof agile teams towards value creation. Finally, environmental sustainability is\npromoted by encouraging agile teams to build a minimum viable product (MVP).",

Prior studies in a\nsimilar setting rely on the neighborhood interpolation capability of\nmulti-layer perceptions to complete missing regions caused by occlusion, which\nleads to artifacts in their predictions. We propose 360FusionNeRF, a\nsemi-supervised learning framework where we introduce geometric supervision and\nsemantic consistency to guide the progressive training process. Firstly, the\ninput image is re-projected to $360^\\circ$ images, and auxiliary depth maps are\nextracted at other camera positions. The depth supervision, in addition to the\nNeRF color guidance, improves the geometry of the synthesized views.\nAdditionally, we introduce a semantic consistency loss that encourages\nrealistic renderings of novel views. We extract these semantic features using a\npre-trained visual encoder such as CLIP, a Vision Transformer trained on\nhundreds of millions of diverse 2D photographs mined from the web with natural\nlanguage supervision.

    "abstract": "With the blooming of Internet-of-Things (IoT), we are witnessing an explosion\nin the number of IoT terminals, triggering an unprecedented demand for\nubiquitous wireless access globally. In this context, the emerging\nlow-Earth-orbit satellites (LEO-SATs) have been regarded as a promising enabler\nto complement terrestrial wireless networks in providing ubiquitous\nconnectivity and bridging the ever-growing digital divide in the expected\nnext-generation wireless communications. Nevertheless, the stringent\nrequirements posed by LEO-SATs have imposed significant challenges to the\ncurrent multiple access schemes and led to an emerging paradigm shift in system\ndesign. In this article, we first provide a comprehensive overview of the\nstate-of-the-art multiple access schemes and investigate their limitations in\nthe context of LEO-SATs. To this end, we propose the amalgamation of the\ngrant-free non-orthogonal multiple access (GF-NOMA) paradigm and the orthogonal\ntime frequency space (OTFS) waveform, for simplifying the connection procedure\nwith reduced access latency and enhanced Doppler-robustness. Critical open\nchallenging issues and future directions are finally presented for further\ntechnical development.",

    "abstract": "The quantization of the PageRank algorithm is a promising tool for a future\nquantum internet. Here we present a modification of the quantum PageRank\nintroducing arbitrary phase rotations (APR) in the underlying Szegedy's quantum\nwalk. We define three different APR schemes with only one phase as a degree of\nfreedom. We have analyzed the behavior of the new algorithms in a small generic\ngraph, observing that a decrease of the phase reduces the standard deviation of\nthe instantaneous PageRank, so the nodes of the network can be distinguished\nbetter. However, the algorithm takes more time to converge, so the phase can\nnot be decreased arbitrarily. With these results we choose a concrete value for\nthe phase to later apply the algorithm to complex scale-free graphs. In these\nnetworks, the original quantum PageRank is able to break the degeneracy of the\nresidual nodes and detect secondary hubs that the classical algorithm\nsuppresses. Nevertheless, not all of the detected secondary hubs are real\naccording to the PageRank's definition. Some APR schemes can overcome this\nproblem, restoring the degeneration of the residual nodes and highlighting the\ntruly secondary hubs of the networks. Finally, we have studied the stability of\nthe new algorithms. The original quantum algorithm was known to be more stable\nthan the classical. We have found that one of our new algorithms whose PageRank\ndistribution resembles the classical one, has a stability similar to the\noriginal quantum algorithm.",

The design of methods to support laboratory\ndetection are crucial in the monitoring of these variants. Hence, in this\npaper, we develop a semi-automated method to design both forward and reverse\nprimer sets to detect SARS-CoV-2 variants. To proceed, we train deep\nConvolution Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify labelled SARS-CoV-2 variants and\nidentify partial genomic features needed for the forward and reverse Polymerase\nChain Reaction (PCR) primer design. Our proposed approach supplements existing\nones while promoting the emerging concept of neural network assisted primer\ndesign for PCR.

    "abstract": "While the distribution patterns of cold-water corals, such as Paragorgia\narborea, have received increasing attention in recent studies, little is known\nabout their in situ activity patterns. In this paper, we examine polyp activity\nin P. arborea using machine learning techniques to analyze high-resolution time\nseries data and photographs obtained from an autonomous lander cluster deployed\nin the Stjernsund, Norway. An interactive illustration of the models derived in\nthis paper is provided online as supplementary material. We find that the best\npredictor of the degree of extension of the coral polyps is current direction\nwith a lag of three hours. Other variables that are not directly associated\nwith water currents, such as temperature and salinity, offer much less\ninformation concerning polyp activity. Interestingly, the degree of polyp\nextension can be predicted more reliably by sampling the laminar flows in the\nwater column above the measurement site than by sampling the more turbulent\nflows in the direct vicinity of the corals. Our results show that the activity\npatterns of the P. arborea polyps are governed by the strong tidal current\nregime of the Stjernsund. It appears that P. arborea does not react to shorter\nchanges in the ambient current regime but instead adjusts its behavior in\naccordance with the large-scale pattern of the tidal cycle itself in order to\noptimize nutrient uptake.",

    "abstract": "In the audio magnetotellurics (AMT) sounding data processing, the absence of\nsferic signals in some time ranges typically results in a lack of energy in the\nAMT dead band, which may cause unreliable resistivity estimate. We propose a\ndeep convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically recognize sferic\nsignals from redundantly recorded data in a long time range and use them to\ncompensate for the resistivity estimation. We train the CNN by using field time\nseries data with different signal to noise rations that were acquired from\ndifferent regions in mainland China. To solve the potential overfitting problem\ndue to the limited number of sferic labels, we propose a training strategy that\nrandomly generates training samples (with random data augmentations) while\noptimizing the CNN model parameters. We stop the training process and data\ngeneration until the training loss converges. In addition, we use a weighted\nbinary cross-entropy loss function to solve the sample imbalance problem to\nbetter optimize the network, use multiple reasonable metrics to evaluate\nnetwork performance, and carry out ablation experiments to optimally choose the\nmodel hyperparameters. Extensive field data applications show that our trained\nCNN can robustly recognize sferic signals from noisy time series for subsequent\nimpedance estimation. The subsequent processing results show that our method\ncan significantly improve S/N and effectively solve the problem of lack of\nenergy in dead band. Compared to the traditional processing method without\nsferic compensation, our method can generate a smoother and more reasonable\napparent resistivity-phase curves and depolarized phase tensor, correct the\nestimation error of sudden drop of high-frequency apparent resistivity and\nabnormal behavior of phase reversal, and finally better restore the real\nshallow subsurface resistivity structure.",

It is based on the key idea of diversity in quantum\ndevices - variations in noise sources, make each (portion of a) device unique,\nand therefore, their impact on an application's fidelity, also unique.\nQuancorde utilizes Clifford canary circuits (which are classically simulable,\nbut also resemble the target application structure and thus suffer similar\nstructural noise impact) to order a diverse ensemble of devices or\nqubits/mappings approximately along the direction of increasing fidelity of the\ntarget application. Quancorde then estimates the correlation of the\nensemble-wide probabilities of each output string of the application, with the\ncanary ensemble ordering, and uses this correlation to weight the application's\nnoisy probability distribution. The correct application outcomes are expected\nto have higher correlation with the canary ensemble order, and thus their\nprobabilities are boosted in this process.\nDoing so, Quancorde improves the fidelity of evaluated quantum applications\nby a mean of 8.9x/4.2x (wrt. different baselines) and up to a maximum of 34x.",

However, most\nexisting DL methods utilize the block-by-block measurement and each measurement\nblock is restored separately, which introduces harmful blocking effects for\nreconstruction. Furthermore, the neuronal receptive fields of those methods are\ndesigned to be the same size in each layer, which can only collect single-scale\nspatial information and has a negative impact on the reconstruction process.\nThis paper proposes a novel framework named Multi-scale Dilated Convolution\nNeural Network (MsDCNN) for CS measurement and reconstruction. During the\nmeasurement period, we directly obtain all measurements from a trained\nmeasurement network, which employs fully convolutional structures and is\njointly trained with the reconstruction network from the input image. It\nneedn't be cut into blocks, which effectively avoids the block effect. During\nthe reconstruction period, we propose the Multi-scale Feature Extraction (MFE)\narchitecture to imitate the human visual system to capture multi-scale features\nfrom the same feature map, which enhances the image feature extraction ability\nof the framework and improves the performance of image reconstruction. In the\nMFE, there are multiple parallel convolution channels to obtain multi-scale\nfeature information.

    "abstract": "Network analysis has been a powerful tool to unveil relationships and\ninteractions among a large number of objects. Yet its effectiveness in\naccurately identifying important node-node interactions is challenged by the\nrapidly growing network size, with data being collected at an unprecedented\ngranularity and scale. Common wisdom to overcome such high dimensionality is\ncollapsing nodes into smaller groups and conducting connectivity analysis on\nthe group level. Dividing efforts into two phases inevitably opens a gap in\nconsistency and drives down efficiency. Consensus learning emerges as a new\nnormal for common knowledge discovery with multiple data sources available. To\nthis end, this paper features developing a unified framework of simultaneous\ngrouping and connectivity analysis by combining multiple data sources. The\nalgorithm also guarantees a statistically optimal estimator.",

    "abstract": "The computation of Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) has become a standard\ntool for the analysis of advective transport in unsteady flow applications. LCS\nidentification is primarily accomplished by evaluating measures based on the\nfinite-time Cauchy Green (CG) strain tensor over the fluid domain. Sampling the\nCG tensor requires the advection of large numbers of fluid tracers, which can\nbe computationally intensive, but presents a large degree of data parallelism.\nProcessing can be specialized to parallel computing architectures, but on the\nother hand, there is compelling need for robust and flexible implementations\nfor end users. Specifically, code that can accommodate analysis of wide-ranging\nfluid mechanics applications, while using a modular structure that is easily\nextended or modified, and facilitates visualization is desirable. We discuss\nthe use of Visualization Toolkit (VTK) libraries as a foundation for\nobject-oriented LCS computation, and how this framework can facilitate\nintegration of LCS computation into flow visualization software such as\nParaView. We also discuss the development of CUDA GPU kernels for efficient\nparallel spatial sampling of the flow map, including optimizing these kernels\nfor better utilization.",

    "abstract": "Small lesions in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images are crucial for\nclinical diagnosis of many kinds of diseases. However, the MRI quality can be\neasily degraded by various noise, which can greatly affect the accuracy of\ndiagnosis of small lesion. Although some methods for denoising MR images have\nbeen proposed, task-specific denoising methods for improving the diagnosis\nconfidence of small lesions are lacking. In this work, we propose a voxel-wise\nhybrid residual MLP-CNN model to denoise three-dimensional (3D) MR images with\nsmall lesions. We combine basic deep learning architecture, MLP and CNN, to\nobtain an appropriate inherent bias for the image denoising and integrate each\noutput layers in MLP and CNN by adding residual connections to leverage\nlong-range information. We evaluate the proposed method on 720 T2-FLAIR brain\nimages with small lesions at different noise levels. The results show the\nsuperiority of our method in both quantitative and visual evaluations on\ntesting dataset compared to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, two experienced\nradiologists agreed that at moderate and high noise levels, our method\noutperforms other methods in terms of recovery of small lesions and overall\nimage denoising quality.

Experimental results\nillustrate that our MAN can achieve varied trade-offs between state-of-the-art\nperformance and computations. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/icandle/MAN.",

    "title": "Quantum Subroutine Composition",
    "abstract": "An important tool in algorithm design is the ability to build algorithms from\nother algorithms that run as subroutines. In the case of quantum algorithms, a\nsubroutine may be called on a superposition of different inputs, which\ncomplicates things. For example, a classical algorithm that calls a subroutine\n$Q$ times, where the average probability of querying the subroutine on input\n$i$ is $p_i$, and the cost of the subroutine on input $i$ is $T_i$, incurs\nexpected cost $Q\\sum_i p_i E[T_i]$ from all subroutine queries. While this\nstatement is obvious for classical algorithms, for quantum algorithms, it is\nmuch less so, since naively, if we run a quantum subroutine on a superposition\nof inputs, we need to wait for all branches of the superposition to terminate\nbefore we can apply the next operation. We nonetheless show an analogous\nquantum statement (*): If $q_i$ is the average query weight on $i$ over all\nqueries, the cost from all quantum subroutine queries is $Q\\sum_i q_i E[T_i]$.\nHere the query weight on $i$ for a particular query is the probability of\nmeasuring $i$ in the input register if we were to measure right before the\nquery.\nWe prove this result using the technique of multidimensional quantum walks,\nrecently introduced in arXiv:2208.13492. We present a more general version of\ntheir quantum walk edge composition result, which yields variable-time quantum\nwalks, generalizing variable-time quantum search, by, for example, replacing\nthe update cost with $\\sqrt{\\sum_{u,v}\\pi_u P_{u,v} E[T_{u,v}^2]}$, where\n$T_{u,v}$ is the cost to move from vertex $u$ to vertex $v$. The same technique\nthat allows us to compose quantum subroutines in quantum walks can also be used\nto compose in any quantum algorithm, which is how we prove (*).",

Meanwhile, it was\nshown that the development of self-supervised pre-trained models can be applied\nto various downstream tasks. In this paper, we will consider the application of\nthe pre-trained model to the real-time SE problem. Specifically, the encoder\nand bottleneck layer of the DEMUCS model are initialized using the\nself-supervised pretrained WavLM model, the convolution in the encoder is\nreplaced by causal convolution, and the transformer encoder in the bottleneck\nlayer is based on causal attention mask. In addition, as discretizing the noisy\nspeech representations is more beneficial for denoising, we utilize a\nquantization module to discretize the representation output from the bottleneck\nlayer, which is then fed into the decoder to reconstruct the clean speech\nwaveform. Experimental results on the Valentini dataset and an internal dataset\nshow that the pre-trained model based initialization can improve the SE\nperformance and the discretization operation suppresses the noise component in\nthe representations to some extent, which can further improve the performance.",

    "abstract": "The problem of sparse multichannel blind deconvolution (S-MBD) arises\nfrequently in many engineering applications such as radar/sonar/ultrasound\nimaging. To reduce its computational and implementation cost, we propose a\ncompression method that enables blind recovery from much fewer measurements\nwith respect to the full received signal in time. The proposed compression\nmeasures the signal through a filter followed by a subsampling, allowing for a\nsignificant reduction in implementation cost. We derive theoretical guarantees\nfor the identifiability and recovery of a sparse filter from compressed\nmeasurements. Our results allow for the design of a wide class of compression\nfilters. We, then, propose a data-driven unrolled learning framework to learn\nthe compression filter and solve the S-MBD problem. The encoder is a recurrent\ninference network that maps compressed measurements into an estimate of sparse\nfilters. We demonstrate that our unrolled learning method is more robust to\nchoices of source shapes and has better recovery performance compared to\noptimization-based methods. Finally, in applications with limited data (fewshot\nlearning), we highlight the superior generalization capability of unrolled\nlearning compared to conventional deep learning.",

Conversely, Text-Audio retrieval takes an audio file\nas a query to retrieve relevant natural language descriptions. Most of the\nliterature train retrieval systems with one audio captioning dataset, but\nevaluating the benefit of training with multiple datasets is underexplored.\nMoreover, retrieval systems have to learn the alignment between elaborated\nsentences describing audio content of variable length ranging from a few\nseconds to several minutes. In this work, we propose a new collection of web\naudio-text pairs and a new framework for retrieval. First, we provide a new\ncollection of about five thousand web audio-text pairs that we refer to as\nWavText5K. When used to train our retrieval system, WavText5K improved\nperformance more than other audio captioning datasets. Second, our framework\nlearns to connect language and audio content by using a text encoder, two audio\nencoders, and a contrastive learning objective. Combining both audio encoders\nhelps to process variable length audio.

    "abstract": "Quantum computing can provide speedups in solving many problems as the\nevolution of a quantum system is described by a unitary operator in an\nexponentially large Hilbert space. Such unitary operators change the phase of\ntheir eigenstates and make quantum algorithms fundamentally different from\ntheir classical counterparts. Based on this unique principle of quantum\ncomputing, we develop a new algorithmic framework \"Quantum phase processing\"\nthat can directly apply arbitrary trigonometric transformations to eigenphases\nof a unitary operator. The quantum phase processing circuit is constructed\nsimply, consisting of single-qubit rotations and controlled-unitaries,\ntypically using only one ancilla qubit. Besides the capability of phase\ntransformation, quantum phase processing in particular can extract the\neigen-information of quantum systems by simply measuring the ancilla qubit,\nmaking it naturally compatible with indirect measurement. Quantum phase\nprocessing complements another powerful framework known as quantum singular\nvalue transformation and leads to more intuitive and efficient quantum\nalgorithms for solving problems that are particularly phase-related. As a\nnotable application, we propose a new quantum phase estimation algorithm\nwithout quantum Fourier transform, which requires the least ancilla qubits and\nmatches the best performance so far. We further exploit the power of our QPP\nframework by investigating a plethora of applications in Hamiltonian\nsimulation, entanglement spectroscopy, and quantum entropies estimation,\ndemonstrating improvements or optimality for almost all cases.",
