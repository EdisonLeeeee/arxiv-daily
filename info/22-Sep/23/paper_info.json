    "abstract": "The \"Curse of Dimensionality\" induced by the rapid development of information\nscience, might have a negative impact when dealing with big datasets. In this\npaper, we propose a variant of the sparrow search algorithm (SSA), called Tent\nL\\'evy flying sparrow search algorithm (TFSSA), and use it to select the best\nsubset of features in the packing pattern for classification purposes. SSA is a\nrecently proposed algorithm that has not been systematically applied to feature\nselection problems. After verification by the CEC2020 benchmark function, TFSSA\nis used to select the best feature combination to maximize classification\naccuracy and minimize the number of selected features. The proposed TFSSA is\ncompared with nine algorithms in the literature. Nine evaluation metrics are\nused to properly evaluate and compare the performance of these algorithms on\ntwenty-one datasets from the UCI repository. Furthermore, the approach is\napplied to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) dataset, yielding the best\naverage classification accuracy and the average number of feature selections,\nrespectively, of 93.47% and 2.1. Experimental results confirm the advantages of\nthe proposed algorithm in improving classification accuracy and reducing the\nnumber of selected features compared to other wrapper-based algorithms.",

    "abstract": "A clustering outcome for high-dimensional data is typically interpreted via\npost-processing, involving dimension reduction and subsequent visualization.\nThis destroys the meaning of the data and obfuscates interpretations. We\npropose algorithm-agnostic interpretation methods to explain clustering\noutcomes in reduced dimensions while preserving the integrity of the data. The\npermutation feature importance for clustering represents a general framework\nbased on shuffling feature values and measuring changes in cluster assignments\nthrough custom score functions. The individual conditional expectation for\nclustering indicates observation-wise changes in the cluster assignment due to\nchanges in the data. The partial dependence for clustering evaluates average\nchanges in cluster assignments for the entire feature space. All methods can be\nused with any clustering algorithm able to reassign instances through soft or\nhard labels. In contrast to common post-processing methods such as principal\ncomponent analysis, the introduced methods maintain the original structure of\nthe features.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of solving robust Markov decision process (MDP),\nwhich involves a set of discounted, finite state, finite action space MDPs with\nuncertain transition kernels. The goal of planning is to find a robust policy\nthat optimizes the worst-case values against the transition uncertainties, and\nthus encompasses the standard MDP planning as a special case. For\n$(\\mathbf{s},\\mathbf{a})$-rectangular uncertainty sets, we develop a\npolicy-based first-order method, namely the robust policy mirror descent\n(RPMD), and establish an $\\mathcal{O}(\\log(1/\\epsilon))$ and\n$\\mathcal{O}(1/\\epsilon)$ iteration complexity for finding an\n$\\epsilon$-optimal policy, with two increasing-stepsize schemes. The prior\nconvergence of RPMD is applicable to any Bregman divergence, provided the\npolicy space has bounded radius measured by the divergence when centering at\nthe initial policy. Moreover, when the Bregman divergence corresponds to the\nsquared euclidean distance, we establish an $\\mathcal{O}(\\max \\{1/\\epsilon,\n1/(\\eta \\epsilon^2)\\})$ complexity of RPMD with any constant stepsize $\\eta$.\nFor a general class of Bregman divergences, a similar complexity is also\nestablished for RPMD with constant stepsizes, provided the uncertainty set\nsatisfies the relative strong convexity. We further develop a stochastic\nvariant, named SRPMD, when the first-order information is only available\nthrough online interactions with the nominal environment. For general Bregman\ndivergences, we establish an $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\epsilon^2)$ and\n$\\mathcal{O}(1/\\epsilon^3)$ sample complexity with two increasing-stepsize\nschemes. For the euclidean Bregman divergence, we establish an\n$\\mathcal{O}(1/\\epsilon^3)$ sample complexity with constant stepsizes. To the\nbest of our knowledge, all the aforementioned results appear to be new for\npolicy-based first-order methods applied to the robust MDP problem.",

    "abstract": "Probabilistic models based on continuous latent spaces, such as variational\nautoencoders, can be understood as uncountable mixture models where components\ndepend continuously on the latent code. They have proven expressive tools for\ngenerative and probabilistic modelling, but are at odds with tractable\nprobabilistic inference, that is, computing marginals and conditionals of the\nrepresented probability distribution. Meanwhile, tractable probabilistic models\nsuch as probabilistic circuits (PCs) can be understood as hierarchical discrete\nmixture models, which allows them to perform exact inference, but often they\nshow subpar performance in comparison to continuous latent-space models. In\nthis paper, we investigate a hybrid approach, namely continuous mixtures of\ntractable models with a small latent dimension. While these models are\nanalytically intractable, they are well amenable to numerical integration\nschemes based on a finite set of integration points. With a large enough number\nof integration points the approximation becomes de-facto exact. Moreover, using\na finite set of integration points, the approximation method can be compiled\ninto a PC performing `exact inference in an approximate model'.

    "abstract": "Cold temperatures during fall and spring have the potential to cause frost\ndamage to grapevines and other fruit plants, which can significantly decrease\nharvest yields. To help prevent these losses, farmers deploy expensive frost\nmitigation measures, such as, sprinklers, heaters, and wind machines, when they\njudge that damage may occur. This judgment, however, is challenging because the\ncold hardiness of plants changes throughout the dormancy period and it is\ndifficult to directly measure. This has led scientists to develop cold\nhardiness prediction models that can be tuned to different grape cultivars\nbased on laborious field measurement data. In this paper, we study whether\ndeep-learning models can improve cold hardiness prediction for grapes based on\ndata that has been collected over a 30-year time period. A key challenge is\nthat the amount of data per cultivar is highly variable, with some cultivars\nhaving only a small amount. For this purpose, we investigate the use of\nmulti-task learning to leverage data across cultivars in order to improve\nprediction performance for individual cultivars. We evaluate a number of\nmulti-task learning approaches and show that the highest performing approach is\nable to significantly improve over learning for single cultivars and\noutperforms the current state-of-the-art scientific model for most cultivars.",

    "abstract": "When humans interact with robots influence is inevitable. Consider an\nautonomous car driving near a human: the speed and steering of the autonomous\ncar will affect how the human drives. Prior works have developed frameworks\nthat enable robots to influence humans towards desired behaviors. But while\nthese approaches are effective in the short-term (i.e., the first few\nhuman-robot interactions), here we explore long-term influence (i.e., repeated\ninteractions between the same human and robot). Our central insight is that\nhumans are dynamic: people adapt to robots, and behaviors which are influential\nnow may fall short once the human learns to anticipate the robot's actions.\nWith this insight, we experimentally demonstrate that a prevalent\ngame-theoretic formalism for generating influential robot behaviors becomes\nless effective over repeated interactions. Next, we propose three modifications\nto Stackelberg games that make the robot's policy both influential and\nunpredictable. We finally test these modifications across simulations and user\nstudies: our results suggest that robots which purposely make their actions\nharder to anticipate are better able to maintain influence over long-term\ninteraction.

    "abstract": "Representation disentanglement is an important goal of representation\nlearning that benefits various downstream tasks. To achieve this goal, many\nunsupervised learning representation disentanglement approaches have been\ndeveloped. However, the training process without utilizing any supervision\nsignal have been proved to be inadequate for disentanglement representation\nlearning. Therefore, we propose a novel weakly-supervised training approach,\nnamed as SW-VAE, which incorporates pairs of input observations as supervision\nsignals by using the generative factors of datasets. Furthermore, we introduce\nstrategies to gradually increase the learning difficulty during training to\nsmooth the training process. As shown on several datasets, our model shows\nsignificant improvement over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on representation\ndisentanglement tasks.",

However, unseen class label prediction is far less explored\ndue to missing classes being invisible in training ML or DL models. In this\nwork, we propose a fuzzy inference system to cope with such a challenge by\nadopting TSK+ fuzzy inference engine in conjunction with the Curvature-based\nFeature Selection (CFS) method. The practical feasibility of our system has\nbeen evaluated by predicting the positioning labels of networking devices\nwithin the realm of the Internet of Things (IoT).

    "abstract": "Recent developments in cyber-physical systems and event-triggered control\nhave led to an increased interest in the impact of sparse disturbances on\ndynamical processes. We study Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) control under\nsparse disturbances by analyzing three distinct policies: the blind online\npolicy, the disturbance-aware policy, and the optimal offline policy. We derive\nthe two-dimensional recurrence structure of the optimal disturbance-aware\npolicy, under the assumption that the controller has information about future\ndisturbance values with only a probabilistic model of their locations in time.\nUnder mild conditions, we show that the disturbance-aware policy converges to\nthe blind online policy if the number of disturbances grows sublinearly in the\ntime horizon. Finally, we provide a finite-horizon regret bound between the\nblind online policy and optimal offline policy, which is proven to be quadratic\nin the number of disturbances and in their magnitude. This provides a useful\ncharacterization of the suboptimality of a standard LQR controller when\nconfronted with unexpected sparse perturbations.",

    "abstract": "Most of the popular Big Data analytics tools evolved to adapt their working\nenvironment to extract valuable information from a vast amount of unstructured\ndata. The ability of data mining techniques to filter this helpful information\nfrom Big Data led to the term Big Data Mining. Shifting the scope of data from\nsmall-size, structured, and stable data to huge volume, unstructured, and\nquickly changing data brings many data management challenges. Different tools\ncope with these challenges in their own way due to their architectural\nlimitations. There are numerous parameters to take into consideration when\nchoosing the right data management framework based on the task at hand. In this\npaper, we present a comprehensive benchmark for two widely used Big Data\nanalytics tools, namely Apache Spark and Hadoop MapReduce, on a common data\nmining task, i.e., classification. We employ several evaluation metrics to\ncompare the performance of the benchmarked frameworks, such as execution time,\naccuracy, and scalability. These metrics are specialized to measure the\nperformance for classification task. To the best of our knowledge, there is no\nprevious study in the literature that employs all these metrics while taking\ninto consideration task-specific concerns. We show that Spark is 5 times faster\nthan MapReduce on training the model. Nevertheless, the performance of Spark\ndegrades when the input workload gets larger. Scaling the environment by\nadditional clusters significantly improves the performance of Spark. However,\nsimilar enhancement is not observed in Hadoop. Machine learning utility of\nMapReduce tend to have better accuracy scores than that of Spark, like around\n3%, even in small size data sets.",

Consequently, people who use shared vehicles on an \"as\nneeded\" basis will have infrequent interactions with automated driving, thereby\nexperiencing interaction gaps. Using human trust data of 25 participants, we\nshow that interaction gaps can affect human trust in automated driving.\nParticipants engaged in a simulator study consisting of two interactions\nseparated by a one-week interaction gap.

Despite the\nlatest success of deep neural networks in a variety of domains, understanding\nthe decision-making process of such complex models still remains a challenging\ntask for domain experts. Especially in the financial domain, merely pointing to\nan anomaly composed of often hundreds of mixed type columns, has limited value\nfor experts.\nHence, in this paper, we propose a framework for explaining anomalies using\ndenoising autoencoders designed for mixed type tabular data. We specifically\nfocus our technique on anomalies that are erroneous observations. This is\nachieved by localizing individual sample columns (cells) with potential errors\nand assigning corresponding confidence scores. In addition, the model provides\nthe expected cell value estimates to fix the errors.\nWe evaluate our approach based on three standard public tabular datasets\n(Credit Default, Adult, IEEE Fraud) and one proprietary dataset (Holdings). We\nfind that denoising autoencoders applied to this task already outperform other\napproaches in the cell error detection rates as well as in the expected value\nrates. Additionally, we analyze how a specialized loss designed for cell error\ndetection can further improve these metrics.

    "abstract": "Small privately-purchased off-grid renewable energy systems (RESs) are\nincreasingly used for energy generation in remote areas. However, such\nprivately-purchased stand-alone RESs are often unaffordable for households with\nlower incomes. While considerable attention has been devoted to a range of\noff-grid microgrid sizing methods, leveraging the potential of data-driven,\nartificial intelligence-based metaheuristic optimisation algorithms is less\nwell-explored. Importantly, data-driven metaheuristics have the potential to\nproduce the nearest solution to the globally optimum solution in microgrid\nsizing applications, which have been recognised as non-deterministic,\npolynomial time-hard (NP-hard) problems. Furthermore, there is a general lack\nof electrified transportation interventions considered during long-term\ngrid-independent microgrid planning phases. In response, this paper introduces\na novel metaheuristic-based strategic off-grid microgrid capacity planning\noptimisation model that is applicable to associated integrated energy and\ne-mobility resource plans. The formulated general off-grid microgrid sizing\nmodel is solved using a competitively selected state-of-the-art metaheuristic,\nnamely moth-flame optimisation. To test the effectiveness of the proposed\nmodel, three independent microgrid development projects have been considered\nfor three communities residing on Aotea-Great Barrier Island, namely Tryphena,\nMedlands, and Mulberry Grove.

Community\nsmells are sociotechnical anti-patterns and one source of social debt that\nimpact software teams, development processes, outcomes, and organizations.\nObjective: To provide an overview of community smells based on published\nliterature, and describe future research. Method: We conducted a systematic\nliterature review (SLR) to identify properties, understand origins and\nevolution, and describe the emergence of community smells. This SLR explains\nthe impact of community smells on teamwork and team performance. Results: We\ninclude 25 studies. Social debt describes the impacts of poor socio-technical\ndecisions on work environments, people, software products, and society. For\neach of the 30 identified community smells, we provide a description,\nmanagement approaches, organizational strategies, and mitigation effectiveness.\nWe identify five groups of management approaches: organizational strategies,\nframeworks, models, tools, and guidelines. We describe 11 properties of\ncommunity smells. We develop the Community Smell Stages Framework to concisely\ndescribe the origin and evolution of community smells. We describe the causes\nand effects for each community smell. We identify and describe 8 types of\ncauses and 11 types of effects for community smells. Finally, we provide 8\nSankey diagrams that offer insights into threats the community smells pose to\nteamwork factors and team performance. Conclusion: Community smells explain the\ninfluence work conditions have on software developers. The literature is scarce\nand focuses on a small number of community smells. Thus, community smells still\nneed more research. This review organizes the state of the art about community\nsmells and provides motivation for future research along with educational\nmaterial.",

Early\nstudies of \"equal-loudness contour\" can trace back to the 1920s and the\nmeasured loudness with respect to intensity and frequency has been revised many\ntimes since then. However, most studies merely focus on synthesized sound, and\nthe induced theories on natural tones with complex timbre have rarely been\njustified. To this end, we investigate both theory and applications of\nnatural-tone loudness perception in this paper via modeling piano tone. The\ntheory part contains: 1) an accurate measurement of piano-tone equal-loudness\ncontour of pitches, and 2) a machine-learning model capable of inferring\nloudness purely based on spectral features trained on human subject\nmeasurements. As for the application, we apply our theory to piano control\ntransfer, in which we adjust the MIDI velocities on two different player pianos\n(in different acoustic environments) to achieve the same perceptual effect.\nExperiments show that both our theoretical loudness modeling and the\ncorresponding performance control transfer algorithm significantly outperform\ntheir baselines.",

In this method which we call\nNashAE, high-dimensional feature disentanglement is accomplished in the\nlow-dimensional latent space of a standard autoencoder (AE) by promoting the\ndiscrepancy between each encoding element and information of the element\nrecovered from all other encoding elements. Disentanglement is promoted\nefficiently by framing this as a minmax game between the AE and an ensemble of\nregression networks which each provide an estimate of an element conditioned on\nan observation of all other elements. We quantitatively compare our approach\nwith leading disentanglement methods using existing disentanglement metrics.\nFurthermore, we show that NashAE has increased reliability and increased\ncapacity to capture salient data characteristics in the learned latent\nrepresentation.",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the effective use of smart inverters for Volt/Var\ncontrol (VVC) on a distribution system. New smart inverters offer Var support\ncapability but for their effective use they need to be coordinated with\nexisting Volt/Var schemes. A new VVC scheme is proposed to facilitate such\ncoordination. The proposed scheme decomposes the problem into two levels. The\nfirst level uses Load Tap Changer (LTC) and Voltage Regulators (VRs) and\ncoordinates their control with smart inverters to adjust the voltage level on\nthe circuit to keep the voltages along the circuit within the desired range.\nThe second level determines Var support needed from smart inverters to minimize\nthe overall power loss in the circuit. The results of the supervisory control\nare sent to the devices which have their local controllers. To avoid frequent\ndispatch, smart inverters are supervised by shifting their Volt/Var\ncharacteristics as needed. This allows for the smart inverters to operate close\nto their optimal control while meeting the limited communication requirements\non a distribution system. A case study using the IEEE 34 bus system shows the\neffectiveness of this supervisory control scheme compared to traditional\nvolt/var schemes.",

We crawl a total of 2,399 posts and\n29,851 associated comments from the r/COVID19_support subreddit and manually\nextract fine-grained personal information categories and types of social\nsupport sought from each post. We develop a BERT-based ensemble classifier to\nautomatically identify types of support offered in users' comments. We then\nanalyze the effect of personal information sharing and posts' topical, lexical,\nand sentiment markers on the acquisition of support and five interaction\nmeasures (submission scores, the number of comments, the number of unique\ncommenters, the length and sentiments of comments). Our findings show that: 1)\nusers were more likely to share their age, education, and location information\nwhen seeking both informational and emotional support, as opposed to pursuing\neither one; 2) while personal information sharing was positively correlated\nwith receiving informational support when requested, it did not correlate with\nemotional support; 3) as the degree of self-disclosure increased, information\nsupport seekers obtained higher submission scores and longer comments, whereas\nemotional support seekers' self-disclosure resulted in lower submission scores,\nfewer comments, and fewer unique commenters; 4) post characteristics affecting\nsocial feedback differed significantly based on types of support sought by post\nauthors. These results provide empirical evidence for the varying effects of\nself-disclosure on acquiring desired support and user involvement online during\nthe COVID-19 pandemic.

This paper focuses on motion planning for a robot that uses\nnontraditional locomotion to explore unpredictable environments such as martian\ncaves. Our robotic concept, ReachBot, uses extendable and retractable booms as\nlimbs to achieve a large reachable workspace while climbing. Each extendable\nboom is capped by a microspine gripper designed for grasping rocky surfaces.\nReachBot leverages its large workspace to navigate around obstacles, over\ncrevasses, and through challenging terrain. Our planning approach must be\nversatile to accommodate variable terrain features and robust to mitigate risks\nfrom the stochastic nature of grasping with spines. In this paper, we introduce\na graph traversal algorithm to select a discrete sequence of grasps based on\navailable terrain features suitable for grasping. This discrete plan is\ncomplemented by a decoupled motion planner that considers the alternating\nphases of body movement and end-effector movement, using a combination of\nsampling-based planning and sequential convex programming to optimize\nindividual phases. We use our motion planner to plan a trajectory across a\nsimulated 2D cave environment with at least 95% probability of success and\ndemonstrate improved robustness over a baseline trajectory.

Recent progress is mainly focused on estimating the activity of\nsome specific elements like humans. In this paper, we leverage a neural motion\nfield for estimating the motion of all points in a multiview setting.

We\npropose to regularize the estimated motion to be predictable. If the motion\nfrom previous frames is known, then the motion in the near future should be\npredictable. Therefore, we introduce a predictability regularization by first\nconditioning the estimated motion on latent embeddings, then by adopting a\npredictor network to enforce predictability on the embeddings.

This paper presents Changing-SLAM, a method for\nrobust Visual SLAM in both dynamic and changing environments. This is achieved\nby using a Bayesian filter combined with a long-term data association\nalgorithm. Also, it employs an efficient algorithm for dynamic keypoints\nfiltering based on object detection that correctly identify features inside the\nbounding box that are not dynamic, preventing a depletion of features that\ncould cause lost tracks. Furthermore, a new dataset was developed with RGB-D\ndata especially designed for the evaluation of changing environments on an\nobject level, called PUC-USP dataset. Six sequences were created using a mobile\nrobot, an RGB-D camera and a motion capture system. The sequences were designed\nto capture different scenarios that could lead to a tracking failure or a map\ncorruption. To the best of our knowledge, Changing-SLAM is the first Visual\nSLAM system that is robust to both dynamic and changing environments, not\nassuming a given camera pose or a known map, being also able to operate in real\ntime.

Federated learning (FL) is emerging as a\nnew paradigm to train machine learning (ML) models in distributed systems,\nincluding vehicles in V2X networks. Rather than sharing and uploading the\ntraining data to the server, the updating of model parameters (e.g., neural\nnetworks' weights and biases) is applied by large populations of interconnected\nvehicles, acting as local learners.

Different from\nexisting studies that only use acoustic data for direction-of-arrival (DoA)\nestimates, the source's distance from sensors is calculated with the\ndirect-to-reverberant energy ratio (DRR) and applied as a new constraint to\neliminate the nonlinear noise from motion reports. A particle filter is applied\nto estimate the critical distance, which is key for associating the source's\ndistance with the DRR. A keyframe method is used to eliminate the deviation of\nthe source position estimation toward the robot. The proposed DoA-DRR acoustic\nSLAM (D-D SLAM) is designed for three-dimensional motion and is suitable for\nmost robots. The method is the first acoustic SLAM algorithm that has been\nvalidated on a real-world indoor scene dataset that contains only acoustic data\nand IMU measurements. Compared with previous methods, D-D SLAM has acceptable\nperformance in locating the robot and building a source map from a real-world\nindoor dataset. The average location accuracy is 0.48 m, while the source\nposition error converges to less than 0.25 m within 2.8 s. These results prove\nthe effectiveness of D-D SLAM in real-world indoor scenes, which may be\nespecially useful in search and rescue missions after disasters where the\nenvironment is foggy, i.e., unsuitable for light or laser irradiation.",

    "title": "In Differential Privacy, There is Truth: On Vote Leakage in Ensemble  Private Learning",
    "abstract": "When learning from sensitive data, care must be taken to ensure that training\nalgorithms address privacy concerns. The canonical Private Aggregation of\nTeacher Ensembles, or PATE, computes output labels by aggregating the\npredictions of a (possibly distributed) collection of teacher models via a\nvoting mechanism. The mechanism adds noise to attain a differential privacy\nguarantee with respect to the teachers' training data. In this work, we observe\nthat this use of noise, which makes PATE predictions stochastic, enables new\nforms of leakage of sensitive information. For a given input, our adversary\nexploits this stochasticity to extract high-fidelity histograms of the votes\nsubmitted by the underlying teachers. From these histograms, the adversary can\nlearn sensitive attributes of the input such as race, gender, or age. Although\nthis attack does not directly violate the differential privacy guarantee, it\nclearly violates privacy norms and expectations, and would not be possible at\nall without the noise inserted to obtain differential privacy. In fact,\ncounter-intuitively, the attack becomes easier as we add more noise to provide\nstronger differential privacy. We hope this encourages future work to consider\nprivacy holistically rather than treat differential privacy as a panacea.",

    "abstract": "3D object detection with multi-sensors is essential for an accurate and\nreliable perception system of autonomous driving and robotics. Existing 3D\ndetectors significantly improve the accuracy by adopting a two-stage paradigm\nwhich merely relies on LiDAR point clouds for 3D proposal refinement. Though\nimpressive, the sparsity of point clouds, especially for the points far away,\nmaking it difficult for the LiDAR-only refinement module to accurately\nrecognize and locate objects.To address this problem, we propose a novel\nmulti-modality two-stage approach named FusionRCNN, which effectively and\nefficiently fuses point clouds and camera images in the Regions of\nInterest(RoI). FusionRCNN adaptively integrates both sparse geometry\ninformation from LiDAR and dense texture information from camera in a unified\nattention mechanism. Specifically, it first utilizes RoIPooling to obtain an\nimage set with a unified size and gets the point set by sampling raw points\nwithin proposals in the RoI extraction step; then leverages an intra-modality\nself-attention to enhance the domain-specific features, following by a\nwell-designed cross-attention to fuse the information from two\nmodalities.FusionRCNN is fundamentally plug-and-play and supports different\none-stage methods with almost no architectural changes. Extensive experiments\non KITTI and Waymo benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly boosts\nthe performances of popular detectors.Remarkably, FusionRCNN significantly\nimproves the strong SECOND baseline by 6.14% mAP on Waymo, and outperforms\ncompeting two-stage approaches.

    "abstract": "Neural networks with physics based inductive biases such as Lagrangian neural\nnetworks (LNN), and Hamiltonian neural networks (HNN) learn the dynamics of\nphysical systems by encoding strong inductive biases. Alternatively, Neural\nODEs with appropriate inductive biases have also been shown to give similar\nperformances. However, these models, when applied to particle based systems,\nare transductive in nature and hence, do not generalize to large system sizes.\nIn this paper, we present a graph based neural ODE, GNODE, to learn the time\nevolution of dynamical systems. Further, we carefully analyse the role of\ndifferent inductive biases on the performance of GNODE. We show that, similar\nto LNN and HNN, encoding the constraints explicitly can significantly improve\nthe training efficiency and performance of GNODE significantly. Our experiments\nalso assess the value of additional inductive biases, such as Newtons third\nlaw, on the final performance of the model. We demonstrate that inducing these\nbiases can enhance the performance of model by orders of magnitude in terms of\nboth energy violation and rollout error. Interestingly, we observe that the\nGNODE trained with the most effective inductive biases, namely MCGNODE,\noutperforms the graph versions of LNN and HNN, namely, Lagrangian graph\nnetworks (LGN) and Hamiltonian graph networks (HGN) in terms of energy\nviolation error by approx 4 orders of magnitude for a pendulum system, and\napprox 2 orders of magnitude for spring systems.

    "abstract": "The configuration manifolds of parallel manipulators exhibit more\nnonlinearity than serial manipulators. Qualitatively, they can be seen to\npossess extra folds. By projecting such manifolds onto spaces of engineering\nrelevance, such as an output workspace or an input actuator space, these folds\ncast edges that exhibit nonsmooth behavior. For example, inside the global\nworkspace bounds of a five-bar linkage appear several local workspace bounds\nthat only constrain certain output modes of the mechanism. The presence of such\nboundaries, which manifest in both input and output projections, serve as a\nsource of confusion when these projections are studied exclusively instead of\nthe configuration manifold itself. Particularly, the design of nonsymmetric\nparallel manipulators has been confounded by the presence of exotic projections\nin their input and output spaces. In this paper, we represent the configuration\nspace with a radius graph, then weight each edge by solving an optimization\nproblem using homotopy continuation to quantify transmission quality. We then\nemploy a graph path planner to approximate geodesics between configuration\npoints that avoid regions of low transmission quality. Our methodology\nautomatically generates paths capable of transitioning between non-neighboring\noutput modes, a motion which involves osculating multiple workspace boundaries\n(local, global, or both).

To address the pressing need to\nimprove the quality of treatment for FoG, devising a computer-aided detection\nand quantification tool for FoG has been increasingly important. As a\nnon-invasive technique for collecting motion patterns, the footstep pressure\nsequences obtained from pressure sensitive gait mats provide a great\nopportunity for evaluating FoG in the clinic and potentially in the home\nenvironment. In this study, FoG detection is formulated as a sequential\nmodelling task and a novel deep learning architecture, namely Adversarial\nSpatio-temporal Network (ASTN), is proposed to learn FoG patterns across\nmultiple levels. A novel adversarial training scheme is introduced with a\nmulti-level subject discriminator to obtain subject-independent FoG\nrepresentations, which helps to reduce the over-fitting risk due to the high\ninter-subject variance. As a result, robust FoG detection can be achieved for\nunseen subjects. The proposed scheme also sheds light on improving\nsubject-level clinical studies from other scenarios as it can be integrated\nwith many existing deep architectures. To the best of our knowledge, this is\none of the first studies of footstep pressure-based FoG detection and the\napproach of utilizing ASTN is the first deep neural network architecture in\npursuit of subject-independent representations. Experimental results on 393\ntrials collected from 21 subjects demonstrate encouraging performance of the\nproposed ASTN for FoG detection with an AUC 0.85.",

It requires quickly exploring the\nenvironments as well as robustly merging the sub-maps built by the agents. We\ntake the view that the existing approaches are either aggressive or\nconservative: Aggressive strategies merge two sub-maps built by different\nagents together when overlap is detected, which can lead to incorrect merging\ndue to the false-positive detection of the overlap and is thus not robust.\nConservative strategies direct one agent to revisit an excessive amount of the\nhistorical trajectory of another agent for verification before merging, which\ncan lower the exploration efficiency due to the repeated exploration of the\nsame space. To intelligently balance the robustness of sub-map merging and\nexploration efficiency, we develop a new approach for lidar-based multi-agent\nexploration, which can direct one agent to repeat another agent's trajectory in\nan \\emph{adaptive} manner based on the quality indicator of the sub-map merging\nprocess. Additionally, our approach extends the recent single-agent\nhierarchical exploration strategy to multiple agents in a \\emph{cooperative}\nmanner by planning for agents with merged sub-maps together to further improve\nexploration efficiency.

    "abstract": "Despite decades of research, existing navigation systems still face\nreal-world challenges when deployed in the wild, e.g., in cluttered home\nenvironments or in human-occupied public spaces. To address this, we present a\nnew class of implicit control policies combining the benefits of imitation\nlearning with the robust handling of system constraints from Model Predictive\nControl (MPC). Our approach, called Performer-MPC, uses a learned cost function\nparameterized by vision context embeddings provided by Performers -- a low-rank\nimplicit-attention Transformer. We jointly train the cost function and\nconstruct the controller relying on it, effectively solving end-to-end the\ncorresponding bi-level optimization problem. We show that the resulting policy\nimproves standard MPC performance by leveraging a few expert demonstrations of\nthe desired navigation behavior in different challenging real-world scenarios.\nCompared with a standard MPC policy, Performer-MPC achieves >40% better goal\nreached in cluttered environments and >65% better on social metrics when\nnavigating around humans.",

    "abstract": "Achieving average consensus without disclosing sensitive information can be a\ncritical concern for multi-agent coordination. This paper examines\nprivacy-preserving average consensus (PPAC) for vector-valued multi-agent\nnetworks. In particular, a set of agents with vector-valued states aim to\ncollaboratively reach an exact average consensus of their initial states, while\neach agent's initial state cannot be disclosed to other agents. We show that\nthe vector-valued PPAC problem can be solved via associated matrix-weighted\nnetworks with the higher-dimensional agent state. Specifically, a novel\ndistributed vector-valued PPAC algorithm is proposed by lifting the agent-state\nto higher-dimensional space and designing the associated matrix-weighted\nnetwork with dynamic, low-rank, positive semi-definite coupling matrices to\nboth conceal the vector-valued agent state and guarantee that the multi-agent\nnetwork asymptotically converges to the average consensus. Essentially, the\nconvergence analysis can be transformed into the average consensus problem on\nswitching matrix-weighted networks. We show that the exact average consensus\ncan be guaranteed and the initial agents' states can be kept private if each\nagent has at least one \"legitimate\" neighbor. The algorithm, involving only\nbasic matrix operations, is computationally more efficient than\ncryptography-based approaches and can be implemented in a fully distributed\nmanner without relying on a third party.

The achieved reduction of renewable energy curtailments\nand the decrease in the total generation cost of the system are quantified\nagainst a counterfactual scenario without storage. A methodology is presented\nto determine the optimum mix of short- and medium-duration storage needed to\nsupport system operation at increased RES penetration levels, using the mixed\ninteger linear programming mathematical optimization. The Greek power system\nserves as a realistic study case, in its planned development for the year 2030,\nwith a targeted annual RES energy penetration in the order of 60%. Li-ion\nbatteries and pumped-hydro are selected as the representative technologies to\ninclude in the storage mix, assuming energy-to-power ratios of up to 6 hours\nfor the former and 10 hours for the latter.

Among transformer models,\nGenerative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) has achieved remarkable performance in\ntext generation, or natural language generation (NLG), which needs the\nprocessing of a large input context in the summarization stage, followed by the\ngeneration stage that produces a single word at a time. The conventional\nplatforms such as GPU are specialized for the parallel processing of large\ninputs in the summarization stage, but their performance significantly degrades\nin the generation stage due to its sequential characteristic. Therefore, an\nefficient hardware platform is required to address the high latency caused by\nthe sequential characteristic of text generation.\nIn this paper, we present DFX, a multi-FPGA acceleration appliance that\nexecutes GPT-2 model inference end-to-end with low latency and high throughput\nin both summarization and generation stages. DFX uses model parallelism and\noptimized dataflow that is model-and-hardware-aware for fast simultaneous\nworkload execution among devices. Its compute cores operate on custom\ninstructions and provide GPT-2 operations end-to-end. We implement the proposed\nhardware architecture on four Xilinx Alveo U280 FPGAs and utilize all of the\nchannels of the high bandwidth memory (HBM) and the maximum number of compute\nresources for high hardware efficiency.

However, most uninterest regions in\nreal-world images are located at out-of-distribution (OOD), which are\ninfeasible to be ideally reconstructed by generative models. Moreover, we\nempirically find that the uninterest region overlapped with the interest region\ncan mangle the original feature of the interest region, e.g., a microphone\noverlapped with a facial region is inverted into the white beard. As a result,\nlowering the distortion of the whole image while maintaining the perceptual\nquality is very challenging. To overcome this trade-off, we propose a simple\nyet effective encoder training scheme, coined IntereStyle, which facilitates\nencoding by focusing on the interest region. IntereStyle steers the encoder to\ndisentangle the encodings of the interest and uninterest regions. To this end,\nwe filter the information of the uninterest region iteratively to regulate the\nnegative impact of the uninterest region. We demonstrate that IntereStyle\nachieves both lower distortion and higher perceptual quality compared to the\nexisting state-of-the-art encoders. Especially, our model robustly conserves\nfeatures of the original images, which shows the robust image editing and style\nmixing results. We will release our code with the pre-trained model after the\nreview.",

As\nan essential factor for human perception, visual attention refers to the\ndynamic selection process of salient regions in biological vision systems.\nAlthough mechanisms of visual attention have achieved great success in computer\nvision, they are rarely introduced into SNNs. Inspired by experimental\nobservations on predictive attentional remapping, we here propose a new\nspatial-channel-temporal-fused attention (SCTFA) module that can guide SNNs to\nefficiently capture underlying target regions by utilizing historically\naccumulated spatial-channel information. Through a systematic evaluation on\nthree event stream datasets (DVS Gesture, SL-Animals-DVS and MNIST-DVS), we\ndemonstrate that the SNN with the SCTFA module (SCTFA-SNN) not only\nsignificantly outperforms the baseline SNN (BL-SNN) and other two SNN models\nwith degenerated attention modules, but also achieves competitive accuracy with\nexisting state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, our detailed analysis shows\nthat the proposed SCTFA-SNN model has strong robustness to noise and\noutstanding stability to incomplete data, while maintaining acceptable\ncomplexity and efficiency.

    "abstract": "Existing detection methods commonly use a parameterized bounding box (BBox)\nto model and detect (horizontal) objects and an additional rotation angle\nparameter is used for rotated objects. We argue that such a mechanism has\nfundamental limitations in building an effective regression loss for rotation\ndetection, especially for high-precision detection with high IoU (e.g. 0.75).\nInstead, we propose to model the rotated objects as Gaussian distributions. A\ndirect advantage is that our new regression loss regarding the distance between\ntwo Gaussians e.g. Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD), can well align the actual\ndetection performance metric, which is not well addressed in existing methods.\nMoreover, the two bottlenecks i.e. boundary discontinuity and square-like\nproblem also disappear. We also propose an efficient Gaussian metric-based\nlabel assignment strategy to further boost the performance. Interestingly, by\nanalyzing the BBox parameters' gradients under our Gaussian-based KLD loss, we\nshow that these parameters are dynamically updated with interpretable physical\nmeaning, which help explain the effectiveness of our approach, especially for\nhigh-precision detection.

    "abstract": "Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR, AR) are increasingly gaining traction\nthanks to their technical advancement and the need for remote connections,\nrecently accentuated by the pandemic. Remote surgery, telerobotics, and virtual\noffices are only some examples of their successes. As users interact with\nVR/AR, they generate extensive behavioral data usually leveraged for measuring\nhuman behavior. However, little is known about how this data can be used for\nother purposes.\nIn this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of user profiling in two\ndifferent use-cases of virtual technologies: AR everyday application ($N=34$)\nand VR robot teleoperation ($N=35$). Specifically, we leverage machine learning\nto identify users and infer their individual attributes (i.e., age, gender). By\nmonitoring users' head, controller, and eye movements, we investigate the ease\nof profiling on several tasks (e.g., walking, looking, typing) under different\nmental loads. Our contribution gives significant insights into user profiling\nin virtual environments.",

With the help of causal language,\nour framework can place constraints on both the procedure of decision making\n(procedural fairness) as well as the outcomes resulting from decisions (outcome\nfairness). Specifically, we show that well-known fairness principles can be\nencoded either as a utility component, a non-causal component, or a causal\ncomponent in a SCALES-CMDP.

In this paper, we propose an approach that builds\non top of BoF pooling to boost its efficiency by ensuring that the items of the\nlearned dictionary are non-redundant.

    "abstract": "Prior studies have demonstrated that approaches to generate an answer summary\nfor a given technical query in Software Question and Answer (SQA) sites are\ndesired. We find that existing approaches are assessed solely through user\nstudies. There is a need for a benchmark with ground truth summaries to\ncomplement assessment through user studies. Unfortunately, such a benchmark is\nnon-existent for answer summarization for technical queries from SQA sites. To\nfill the gap, we manually construct a high-quality benchmark to enable\nautomatic evaluation of answer summarization for technical queries for SQA\nsites. Using the benchmark, we comprehensively evaluate the performance of\nexisting approaches and find that there is still a big room for improvement.\nMotivated by the results, we propose a new approach TechSumBot with three key\nmodules:1) Usefulness Ranking module, 2) Centrality Estimation module, and 3)\nRedundancy Removal module. We evaluate TechSumBot in both automatic (i.e.,\nusing our benchmark) and manual (i.e., via a user study) manners. The results\nfrom both evaluations consistently demonstrate that TechSumBot outperforms the\nbest performing baseline approaches from both SE and NLP domains by a large\nmargin, i.e., 10.83%-14.90%, 32.75%-36.59%, and 12.61%-17.54%, in terms of\nROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L on automatic evaluation, and 5.79%-9.23% and\n17.03%-17.68%, in terms of average usefulness and diversity score on human\nevaluation. This highlights that the automatic evaluation of our benchmark can\nuncover findings similar to the ones found through user studies. More\nimportantly, automatic evaluation has a much lower cost, especially when it is\nused to assess a new approach. Additionally, we also conducted an ablation\nstudy, which demonstrates that each module in TechSumBot contributes to\nboosting the overall performance of TechSumBot.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, ridesharing becomes a popular commuting mode. Dynamically arriving\nriders post their origins and destinations, then the platform assigns drivers\nto serve them. In ridesharing, different groups of riders can be served by one\ndriver if their trips can share common routes. Recently, many ridesharing\ncompanies (e.g., Didi and Uber) further propose a new mode, namely \"ridesharing\nwith meeting points\". Specifically, with a short walking distance but less\npayment, riders can be picked up and dropped off around their origins and\ndestinations, respectively. In addition, meeting points enables more flexible\nrouting for drivers, which can potentially improve the global profit of the\nsystem. In this paper, we first formally define the Meeting-Point-based Online\nRidesharing Problem (MORP). We prove that MORP is NP-hard and there is no\npolynomial-time deterministic algorithm with a constant competitive ratio for\nit. We notice that a structure of vertex set, $k$-skip cover, fits well to the\nMORP. $k$-skip cover tends to find the vertices (meeting points) that are\nconvenient for riders and drivers to come and go. With meeting points, MORP\ntends to serve more riders with these convenient vertices. Based on the idea,\nwe introduce a convenience-based meeting point candidates selection algorithm.\nWe further propose a hierarchical meeting-point oriented graph (HMPO graph),\nwhich ranks vertices for assignment effectiveness and constructs $k$-skip cover\nto accelerate the whole assignment process. Finally, we utilize the merits of\n$k$-skip cover points for ridesharing and propose a novel algorithm, namely\nSMDB, to solve MORP. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets\nvalidate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms.",

    "abstract": "The Vision Transformer architecture has shown to be competitive in the\ncomputer vision (CV) space where it has dethroned convolution-based networks in\nseveral benchmarks. Nevertheless, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) remain\nthe preferential architecture for the representation module in Reinforcement\nLearning. In this work, we study pretraining a Vision Transformer using several\nstate-of-the-art self-supervised methods and assess data-efficiency gains from\nthis training framework. We propose a new self-supervised learning method\ncalled TOV-VICReg that extends VICReg to better capture temporal relations\nbetween observations by adding a temporal order verification task. Furthermore,\nwe evaluate the resultant encoders with Atari games in a sample-efficiency\nregime. Our results show that the vision transformer, when pretrained with\nTOV-VICReg, outperforms the other self-supervised methods but still struggles\nto overcome a CNN. Nevertheless, we were able to outperform a CNN in two of the\nten games where we perform a 100k steps evaluation.

The non-smoothness of the solutions to\nsuch problems leads to the performance of spectral methods based on the\nclassical polynomials such as Chebyshev, Legendre, Laguerre, etc, with a low\norder of convergence. For this reason, the development of classic numerical\nmethods to solve such problems becomes a challenging issue. Since the\nnon-smooth solutions have the same asymptotic behavior with polynomials of\nfractional powers, therefore, fractional basis functions are the best candidate\nto overcome the drawbacks of the accuracy of the spectral methods. On the other\nhand, the fractional integration of the fractional polynomials functions is in\nthe class of fractional polynomials and this is one of the main advantages of\nusing the fractional basis functions. In this paper, an implicit spectral\ncollocation method based on the fractional Chelyshkov basis functions is\nintroduced. The framework of the method is to reduce the problem into a\nnonlinear system of equations utilizing the spectral collocation method along\nwith the fractional operational integration matrix.

Our results show\nthat in general the solvers learned by NCO approaches still fall short of\ntraditional solvers in nearly all these aspects.

    "abstract": "Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are widely-used accelerators for\ndata-parallel applications. In many GPU applications, GPU memory bandwidth\nbottlenecks performance, causing underutilization of GPU cores. Hence,\ndisabling many cores does not affect the performance of memory-bound workloads.\nWhile simply power-gating unused GPU cores would save energy, prior works\nattempt to better utilize GPU cores for other applications (ideally\ncompute-bound), which increases the GPU's total throughput.\nIn this paper, we introduce Morpheus, a new hardware/software co-designed\ntechnique to boost the performance of memory-bound applications. The key idea\nof Morpheus is to exploit unused core resources to extend the GPU last level\ncache (LLC) capacity. In Morpheus, each GPU core has two execution modes:\ncompute mode and cache mode. Cores in compute mode operate conventionally and\nrun application threads. However, for the cores in cache mode, Morpheus invokes\na software helper kernel that uses the cores' on-chip memories (i.e., register\nfile, shared memory, and L1) in a way that extends the LLC capacity for a\nrunning memory-bound workload. Morpheus adds a controller to the GPU hardware\nto forward LLC requests to either the conventional LLC (managed by hardware) or\nthe extended LLC (managed by the helper kernel). Our experimental results show\nthat Morpheus improves the performance and energy efficiency of a baseline GPU\narchitecture by an average of 39% and 58%, respectively, across several\nmemory-bound workloads. Morpheus' performance is within 3% of a GPU design that\nhas a quadruple-sized conventional LLC. Morpheus can thus contribute to\nreducing the hardware dedicated to a conventional LLC by exploiting idle cores'\non-chip memory resources as additional cache capacity.",

    "abstract": "Video temporal grounding (VTG) targets to localize temporal moments in an\nuntrimmed video according to a natural language (NL) description. Since\nreal-world applications provide a never-ending video stream, it raises demands\nfor temporal grounding for long-form videos, which leads to two major\nchallenges: (1) the long video length makes it difficult to process the entire\nvideo without decreasing sample rate and leads to high computational burden;\n(2) the accurate multi-modal alignment is more challenging as the number of\nmoment candidates increases. To address these challenges, we propose CONE, an\nefficient window-centric COarse-to-fiNE alignment framework, which flexibly\nhandles long-form video inputs with higher inference speed, and enhances the\ntemporal grounding via our novel coarse-to-fine multi-modal alignment\nframework. Specifically, we dynamically slice the long video into candidate\nwindows via a sliding window approach. Centering at windows, CONE (1) learns\nthe inter-window (coarse-grained) semantic variance through contrastive\nlearning and speeds up inference by pre-filtering the candidate windows\nrelevant to the NL query, and (2) conducts intra-window (fine-grained)\ncandidate moments ranking utilizing the powerful multi-modal alignment ability\nof a contrastive vision-text pre-trained model. Extensive experiments on two\nlarge-scale VTG benchmarks for long videos consistently show a substantial\nperformance gain (from 3.13% to 6.87% on MAD and from 10.46% to 13.46% on\nEgo4d-NLQ) and CONE achieves the SOTA results on both datasets. Analysis\nreveals the effectiveness of components and higher efficiency in long video\ngrounding as our system improves the inference speed by 2x on Ego4d-NLQ and 15x\non MAD while keeping the SOTA performance of CONE.",

In this paper, we\npropose a loss function that can improve the recall of an important class while\nmaintaining the same level of accuracy as the case using cross-entropy loss.\nFor our purpose, we need to make the separation of the important class better\nthan the other classes. However, existing methods that give a class-sensitive\npenalty for cross-entropy loss do not improve the separation. On the other\nhand, the method that gives a margin to the angle between the feature vectors\nand the weight vectors of the last fully connected layer corresponding to each\nfeature can improve the separation. Therefore, we propose a loss function that\ncan improve the separation of the important class by setting the margin only\nfor the important class, called Class-sensitive Additive Angular Margin Loss\n(CAMRI Loss). CAMRI loss is expected to reduce the variance of angles between\nfeatures and weights of the important class relative to other classes due to\nthe margin around the important class in the feature space by adding a penalty\nto the angle. In addition, concentrating the penalty only on the important\nclasses hardly sacrifices the separation of the other classes.

    "title": "Learning swimming via deep reinforcement learning",
    "abstract": "For decades, people have been seeking for fishlike flapping motions that can\nrealize underwater propulsion with low energy cost. Complexity of the\nnonstationary flow field around the flapping body makes this problem very\ndifficult. In earlier studies, motion patterns are usually prescribed as\ncertain periodic functions which constrains the following optimization process\nin a small subdomain of the whole motion space. In this work, to avoid this\nmotion constraint, a variational autoencoder (VAE) is designed to compress\nvarious flapping motions into a simple action vector. Then we let a flapping\nairfoil continuously interact with water tunnel environment and adjust its\naction accordingly through a reinforcement learning (RL) framework. By this\nautomatic close-looped experiment, we obtain several motion patterns that can\nresult in high hydrodynamic efficiency comparing to pure harmonic motions with\nthe same thrust level. And we find that, after numerous trials and errors, RL\ntrainings in current experiment always converge to motion patterns that are\nclose to harmonic motions. In other words, current work proves that harmonic\nmotion with appropriate amplitude and frequency is always an optimal choice for\nefficient underwater propulsion. Furthermore, the RL framework proposed here\ncan be also extended to the study of other complex swimming problems, which\nmight pave the way for the creation of a robotic fish that can swim like a real\nfish.",

Many of these strategies require accurate\nnetwork models to work effectively. However, distribution network data are\nknown to contain errors, and attention has been given to techniques that allow\nto derive improved network information. This paper presents a novel method to\nderive line impedance values from smart meter measurement time series, with\nrealistic assumptions in terms of meter accuracy, resolution and penetration.\nThe method is based on unbalanced state estimation and is cast as a non-convex\nquadratically constrained optimization problem. Both line lengths and impedance\nmatrix models can be estimated based on an exact nonlinear formulation of the\nsteady-state three-phase network physics. The method is evaluated on the IEEE\nEuropean Low Voltage feeder (906 buses) and shows promising results.",

However, the convolution and fully-connected layers\nare not equivariant or invariant to other affine geometric transformations.\nRecently, a new class of CNNs is proposed in which the conventional layers of\nCNNs are replaced with equivariant convolution, pooling, and\nbatch-normalization layers. The final classification layer in equivariant\nneural networks is invariant to different affine geometric transformations such\nas rotation, reflection and translation, and the scalar value is obtained by\neither eliminating the spatial dimensions of filter responses using convolution\nand down-sampling throughout the network or average is taken over the filter\nresponses. In this work, we propose to integrate the orthogonal moments which\ngives the high-order statistics of the function as an effective means for\nencoding global invariance with respect to rotation, reflection and translation\nin fully-connected layers. As a result, the intermediate layers of the network\nbecome equivariant while the classification layer becomes invariant. The most\nwidely used Zernike, pseudo-Zernike and orthogonal Fourier-Mellin moments are\nconsidered for this purpose. The effectiveness of the proposed work is\nevaluated by integrating the invariant transition and fully-connected layer in\nthe architecture of group-equivariant CNNs (G-CNNs) on rotated MNIST and\nCIFAR10 datasets.",

A general time\ncorrelated Nakagami fading channel covering fast fading and Rayleigh fading as\nspecial cases is considered here.

The\naccuracy of the analytical results is verified by computer simulations and the\nresults reveal that cooperative HARQ-IR scheme can benefit from high fading\norder and low channel time correlation.

    "abstract": "Taking advantage of the many recent advances in deep learning, text-to-image\ngenerative models currently have the merit of attracting the general public\nattention. Two of these models, DALL-E 2 and Imagen, have demonstrated that\nhighly photorealistic images could be generated from a simple textual\ndescription of an image. Based on a novel approach for image generation called\ndiffusion models, text-to-image models enable the production of many different\ntypes of high resolution images, where human imagination is the only limit.\nHowever, these models require exceptionally large amounts of computational\nresources to train, as well as handling huge datasets collected from the\ninternet. In addition, neither the codebase nor the models have been released.\nIt consequently prevents the AI community from experimenting with these\ncutting-edge models, making the reproduction of their results complicated, if\nnot impossible.\nIn this thesis, we aim to contribute by firstly reviewing the different\napproaches and techniques used by these models, and then by proposing our own\nimplementation of a text-to-image model. Highly based on DALL-E 2, we introduce\nseveral slight modifications to tackle the high computational cost induced. We\nthus have the opportunity to experiment in order to understand what these\nmodels are capable of, especially in a low resource regime. In particular, we\nprovide additional and analyses deeper than the ones performed by the authors\nof DALL-E 2, including ablation studies.\nBesides, diffusion models use so-called guidance methods to help the\ngenerating process. We introduce a new guidance method which can be used in\nconjunction with other guidance methods to improve image quality. Finally, the\nimages generated by our model are of reasonably good quality, without having to\nsustain the significant training costs of state-of-the-art text-to-image\nmodels.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised sentence embeddings learning has been recently dominated by\ncontrastive learning methods (e.g., SimCSE), which keep positive pairs similar\nand push negative pairs apart. The contrast operation aims to keep as much\ninformation as possible by maximizing the mutual information between positive\ninstances, which leads to redundant information in sentence embedding. To\naddress this problem, we present an information minimization based contrastive\nlearning (InforMin-CL) model to retain the useful information and discard the\nredundant information by maximizing the mutual information and minimizing the\ninformation entropy between positive instances meanwhile for unsupervised\nsentence representation learning. Specifically, we find that information\nminimization can be achieved by simple contrast and reconstruction objectives.\nThe reconstruction operation reconstitutes the positive instance via the other\npositive instance to minimize the information entropy between positive\ninstances. We evaluate our model on fourteen downstream tasks, including both\nsupervised and unsupervised (semantic textual similarity) tasks. Extensive\nexperimental results show that our InforMin-CL obtains a state-of-the-art\nperformance.",

    "abstract": "Simulating realistic sensors is a challenging part in data generation for\nautonomous systems, often involving carefully handcrafted sensor design, scene\nproperties, and physics modeling. To alleviate this, we introduce a pipeline\nfor data-driven simulation of a realistic LiDAR sensor. We propose a model that\nlearns a mapping between RGB images and corresponding LiDAR features such as\nraydrop or per-point intensities directly from real datasets. We show that our\nmodel can learn to encode realistic effects such as dropped points on\ntransparent surfaces or high intensity returns on reflective materials. When\napplied to naively raycasted point clouds provided by off-the-shelf simulator\nsoftware, our model enhances the data by predicting intensities and removing\npoints based on the scene's appearance to match a real LiDAR sensor. We use our\ntechnique to learn models of two distinct LiDAR sensors and use them to improve\nsimulated LiDAR data accordingly. Through a sample task of vehicle\nsegmentation, we show that enhancing simulated point clouds with our technique\nimproves downstream task performance.",

This paper aims to bypass this\nquadrature exactness assumption by replacing it with the Marcinkiewicz--Zygmund\nproperty proposed in a previous paper. Consequently, hyperinterpolation can be\nconstructed by a positive-weight quadrature rule (not necessarily with\nquadrature exactness). This scheme is referred to as unfettered\nhyperinterpolation. This paper provides a reasonable error estimate for\nunfettered hyperinterpolation. The error estimate generally consists of two\nterms: a term representing the error estimate of the original\nhyperinterpolation of full quadrature exactness and another introduced as\ncompensation for the loss of exactness degrees. A guide to controlling the\nnewly introduced term in practice is provided. In particular, if the quadrature\npoints form a quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) design, then there is a refined error\nestimate. Numerical experiments verify the error estimates and the practical\nguide.",

    "abstract": "Authentication systems are vulnerable to model inversion attacks where an\nadversary is able to approximate the inverse of a target machine learning\nmodel. Biometric models are a prime candidate for this type of attack. This is\nbecause inverting a biometric model allows the attacker to produce a realistic\nbiometric input to spoof biometric authentication systems.\nOne of the main constraints in conducting a successful model inversion attack\nis the amount of training data required. In this work, we focus on iris and\nfacial biometric systems and propose a new technique that drastically reduces\nthe amount of training data necessary. By leveraging the output of multiple\nmodels, we are able to conduct model inversion attacks with 1/10th the training\nset size of Ahmad and Fuller (IJCB 2020) for iris data and 1/1000th the\ntraining set size of Mai et al. (Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence\n2019) for facial data. We denote our new attack technique as structured random\nwith alignment loss. Our attacks are black-box, requiring no knowledge of the\nweights of the target neural network, only the dimension, and values of the\noutput vector.\nTo show the versatility of the alignment loss, we apply our attack framework\nto the task of membership inference (Shokri et al., IEEE S&P 2017) on biometric\ndata. For the iris, membership inference attack against classification networks\nimproves from 52% to 62% accuracy.",

The\napplication of popular randomized methods, such as the randomized singular\nvalue decomposition or the Nystr\\\"om approximation, to $f(A)$ requires\nmultiplying $f(A)$ with a few random vectors. A significant disadvantage of\nsuch an approach, matrix-vector products with $f(A)$ are considerably more\nexpensive than matrix-vector products with $A$, even when carried out only\napproximately via, e.g., the Lanczos method. In this work, we present and\nanalyze funNystr\\\"om, a simple and inexpensive method that constructs a\nlow-rank approximation of $f(A)$ directly from a Nystr\\\"om approximation of\n$A$, completely bypassing the need for matrix-vector products with $f(A)$. It\nis sensible to use funNystr\\\"om whenever $f$ is monotone and satisfies $f(0) =\n0$. Under the stronger assumption that $f$ is operator monotone, which includes\nthe matrix square root $A^{1/2}$ and the matrix logarithm $\\log(I+A)$, we\nderive probabilistic bounds for the error in the Frobenius, nuclear, and\noperator norms. These bounds confirm the numerical observation that\nfunNystr\\\"om tends to return an approximation that compares well with the best\nlow-rank approximation of $f(A)$. Our method is also of interest when\nestimating quantities associated with $f(A)$, such as the trace or the diagonal\nentries of $f(A)$.

However, due to the costs of pretraining, most research uses\npublic models whose pretraining methodology, such as the choice of\ntokenization, corpus size, and computational budget, might differ drastically.\nWhen researchers pretrain their own models, they often do so under a\nconstrained budget, and the resulting models might underperform significantly\ncompared to SOTA models. These experimental differences led to various\ninconsistent conclusions about the nature of the cross-lingual ability of these\nmodels. To help further research on the topic, we released 10 monolingual\nbyte-level models rigorously pretrained under the same configuration with a\nlarge compute budget (equivalent to 420 days on a V100) and corpora that are 4\ntimes larger than the original BERT's. Because they are tokenizer-free, the\nproblem of unseen token embeddings is eliminated, thus allowing researchers to\ntry a wider range of cross-lingual experiments in languages with different\nscripts.

    "title": "Inverted Landing in a Small Aerial Robot via Deep Reinforcement Learning  for Triggering and Control of Rotational Maneuvers",
    "abstract": "Inverted landing in a rapid and robust manner is a challenging feat for\naerial robots, especially while depending entirely on onboard sensing and\ncomputation. In spite of this, this feat is routinely performed by biological\nfliers such as bats, flies, and bees. Our previous work has identified a direct\ncausal connection between a series of onboard visual cues and kinematic actions\nthat allow for reliable execution of this challenging aerobatic maneuver in\nsmall aerial robots. In this work, we first utilized Deep Reinforcement\nLearning and a physics-based simulation to obtain a general, optimal control\npolicy for robust inverted landing starting from any arbitrary approach\ncondition. This optimized control policy provides a computationally-efficient\nmapping from the system's observational space to its motor command action\nspace, including both triggering and control of rotational maneuvers. This was\ndone by training the system over a large range of approach flight velocities\nthat varied with magnitude and direction.\nNext, we performed a sim-to-real transfer and experimental validation of the\nlearned policy via domain randomization, by varying the robot's inertial\nparameters in the simulation. Through experimental trials, we identified\nseveral dominant factors which greatly improved landing robustness and the\nprimary mechanisms that determined inverted landing success. We expect the\nlearning framework developed in this study can be generalized to solve more\nchallenging tasks, such as utilizing noisy onboard sensory data, landing on\nsurfaces of various orientations, or landing on dynamically-moving surfaces.",

However,\nin this framework, matching errors induced by the difficulty of semantic\nmatching across cross-domain, e.g., sketch and photo, can be easily propagated\nto the generation step, which in turn leads to degenerated results. Motivated\nby the recent success of diffusion models overcoming the shortcomings of GANs,\nwe incorporate the diffusion models to overcome these limitations.\nSpecifically, we formulate a diffusion-based matching-and-generation framework\nthat interleaves cross-domain matching and diffusion steps in the latent space\nby iteratively feeding the intermediate warp into the noising process and\ndenoising it to generate a translated image. In addition, to improve the\nreliability of the diffusion process, we design a confidence-aware process\nusing cycle-consistency to consider only confident regions during translation.\nExperimental results show that our MIDMs generate more plausible images than\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

However, they are difficult to employ since they are\nsubject to high variability from manually crafted prompts, and typically\nrequire billion-parameter language models to achieve high accuracy. To address\nthese shortcomings, we propose SetFit (Sentence Transformer Fine-tuning), an\nefficient and prompt-free framework for few-shot fine-tuning of Sentence\nTransformers (ST). SetFit works by first fine-tuning a pretrained ST on a small\nnumber of text pairs, in a contrastive Siamese manner. The resulting model is\nthen used to generate rich text embeddings, which are used to train a\nclassification head. This simple framework requires no prompts or verbalizers,\nand achieves high accuracy with orders of magnitude less parameters than\nexisting techniques. Our experiments show that SetFit obtains comparable\nresults with PEFT and PET techniques, while being an order of magnitude faster\nto train. We also show that SetFit can be applied in multilingual settings by\nsimply switching the ST body.

    "abstract": "Compressive Sensing has well boosted massive random access protocols over the\nlast decade. In this paper we apply an orthogonal FFT basis as it is used in\nOFDM, but subdivide its image into so-called sub-channels and let each\nsub-channel take only a fraction of the load. In a random fashion the\nsubdivision is consecutively applied over a suitable number of time-slots.\nWithin the time-slots the users will not change their sub-channel assignment\nand send in parallel the data. Activity detection is carried out jointly across\ntime-slots in each of the sub-channels. For such system design we derive three\nrather fundamental results: i) First, we prove that the subdivision can be\ndriven to the extent that the activity in each sub-channel is sparse by design.\nAn effect that we call sparsity capture effect. ii) Second, we prove that\neffectively the system can sustain any overload situation relative to the FFT\ndimension, i.e. detection failure of active and non-active users can be kept\nbelow any desired threshold regardless of the number of users. The only price\nto pay is delay, i.e. the number of time-slots over which cross-detection is\nperformed. We achieve this by jointly exploring the effect of measure\nconcentration in time and frequency and careful system parameter scaling. iii)\nThird, we prove that parallel to activity detection active users can carry one\nsymbol per pilot resource and time-slot so it supports so-called one-shot\nmessaging.\nThe key to proving these results are new concentration results for sequences\nof randomly sub-sampled FFTs detecting the sparse vectors \"en bloc\".\nEventually, we show by simulations that the system is scalable resulting in a\ncoarsely 30-fold capacity increase compared to standard OFDM.",

One important approach of KG generation is to map the raw data\nto a given KG schema, namely a domain ontology, and construct the entities and\nproperties according to the ontology. However, the automatic generation of such\nontology is demanding and existing solutions are often not satisfactory. An\nimportant challenge is a trade-off between two principles of ontology\nengineering: knowledge-orientation and data-orientation. The former one\nprescribes that an ontology should model the general knowledge of a domain,\nwhile the latter one emphasises on reflecting the data specificities to ensure\ngood usability. We address this challenge by our method of ontology reshaping,\nwhich automates the process of converting a given domain ontology to a smaller\nontology that serves as the KG schema. The domain ontology can be designed to\nbe knowledge-oriented and the KG schema covers the data specificities. In\naddition, our approach allows the option of including user preferences in the\nloop.

    "abstract": "Wind turbine (WT) controllers are often geared towards maximum power\nextraction, while suitable operating constraints should be guaranteed such that\nWT components are protected from failures. Control strategies can be also\ndevised to reduce the generated power, for instance to track a power reference\nprovided by the grid operator. They are called down-regulation strategies and\nallow to balance power generation and grid loads, as well as to provide\nancillary grid services, such as frequency regulation. Although this balance is\nlimited by the wind availability and grid demand, the quality of wind energy\ncan be improved by introducing down-regulation strategies that make use of the\nkinetic energy of the turbine dynamics. This paper shows how the kinetic energy\nin the rotating components of turbines can be used as an additional\ndegree-of-freedom by different down-regulation strategies. In particular we\nexplore the power tracking problem based on convex model predictive control\n(MPC) at a single wind turbine. The use of MPC allows us to introduce a further\nconstraint that guarantees flow stability and avoids stall conditions.\nSimulation results are used to illustrate the performance of the developed\ndown-regulation strategies. Notably, by maximizing rotor speeds, and thus\nkinetic energy, the turbine can still temporarily guarantee tracking of a given\npower reference even when occasional saturation of the available wind power\noccurs. In the study case we proved that our approach can guarantee power\ntracking in saturated conditions for 10 times longer than with traditional\ndown-regulation strategies.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a unified analysis of the mixed radio-frequency\n(RF)/free-space optics (FSO) relaying system, with multiple variable-gain\namplify-and-forward relays. The partial relay selection (PRS) is employed to\nselect the active relay for further re-transmission. Due to fast fading\nstatistics of the first RF hop, it is assumed that the channel state\ninformation of the RF link is outdated, which is used for both the relay gain\nadjustment and the PRS procedure. The RF hops are subject to the Rayleigh\nfading, while the FSO hop is affected by the atmospheric turbulence and the\npointing errors. The intensity fluctuations of the optical signal caused by\natmospheric turbulence are modeled by the general Malaga (M) distribution,\nwhich takes into account the effect of multiple scattered components. An exact\nexpression for the outage probability is derived. In addition,\nhigh-signal-to-noise-ratio approximations are provided, which can be used to\nefficiently determine the outage probability floor. Numerical results are\nvalidated by Monte Carlo simulations, which are used to examine the effects of\nthe system and channel parameters on the RF/FSO system performance.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is an agent-based approach for teaching robots to\nnavigate within the physical world. Gathering data for RL is known to be a\nlaborious task, and real-world experiments can be risky. Simulators facilitate\nthe collection of training data in a quicker and more cost-effective manner.\nHowever, RL frequently requires a significant number of simulation steps for an\nagent to become skilful at simple tasks. This is a prevalent issue within the\nfield of RL-based visual quadrotor navigation where state dimensions are\ntypically very large and dynamic models are complex. Furthermore, rendering\nimages and obtaining physical properties of the agent can be computationally\nexpensive. To solve this, we present a simulation framework, built on AirSim,\nwhich provides efficient parallel training. Building on this framework, Ape-X\nis modified to incorporate decentralised training of AirSim environments to\nmake use of numerous networked computers. Through experiments we were able to\nachieve a reduction in training time from 3.9 hours to 11 minutes using the\naforementioned framework and a total of 74 agents and two networked computers.\nFurther details including a github repo and videos about our project,\nPRL4AirSim, can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/prl4airsim/home",

    "abstract": "Agile flights of autonomous quadrotors in cluttered environments require\nconstrained motion planning and control subject to translational and rotational\ndynamics. Traditional model-based methods typically demand complicated design\nand heavy computation. In this paper, we develop a novel deep reinforcement\nlearning-based method that tackles the challenging task of flying through a\ndynamic narrow gate. We design a model predictive controller with its adaptive\ntracking references parameterized by a deep neural network (DNN). These\nreferences include the traversal time and the quadrotor SE(3) traversal pose\nthat encourage the robot to fly through the gate with maximum safety margins\nfrom various initial conditions. To cope with the difficulty of training in\nhighly dynamic environments, we develop a reinforce-imitate learning framework\nto train the DNN efficiently that generalizes well to diverse settings.\nFurthermore, we propose a binary search algorithm that allows online adaption\nof the SE(3) references to dynamic gates in real-time. Finally, through\nextensive high-fidelity simulations, we show that our approach is robust to the\ngate's velocity uncertainties and adaptive to different gate trajectories and\norientations.",

Moreover, we prove a\nmatching lower bound for the deterministic case establishing that the tradeoff\nbetween consistency and robustness is optimal, and show a lower bound for the\nrandomized algorithm.

    "abstract": "An increasing number of people now rely on online platforms to meet their\nhealth information needs. Thus identifying inconsistent or conflicting textual\nhealth information has become a safety-critical task. Health advice data poses\na unique challenge where information that is accurate in the context of one\ndiagnosis can be conflicting in the context of another. For example, people\nsuffering from diabetes and hypertension often receive conflicting health\nadvice on diet. This motivates the need for technologies which can provide\ncontextualized, user-specific health advice. A crucial step towards\ncontextualized advice is the ability to compare health advice statements and\ndetect if and how they are conflicting. This is the task of health conflict\ndetection (HCD). Given two pieces of health advice, the goal of HCD is to\ndetect and categorize the type of conflict. It is a challenging task, as (i)\nautomatically identifying and categorizing conflicts requires a deeper\nunderstanding of the semantics of the text, and (ii) the amount of available\ndata is quite limited.\nIn this study, we are the first to explore HCD in the context of pre-trained\nlanguage models. We find that DeBERTa-v3 performs best with a mean F1 score of\n0.68 across all experiments. We additionally investigate the challenges posed\nby different conflict types and how synthetic data improves a model's\nunderstanding of conflict-specific semantics. Finally, we highlight the\ndifficulty in collecting real health conflicts and propose a human-in-the-loop\nsynthetic data augmentation approach to expand existing HCD datasets. Our HCD\ntraining dataset is over 2x bigger than the existing HCD dataset and is made\npublicly available on Github.",

As we\nwanted to gain deeper insights into the security implications of these misuses,\nwe created an extensive vulnerability model for cryptographic API misuses.

Theoretical analysis of D2EAL is carried\nout, which involves the analysis of worst-case bounds on cumulative prediction\nloss, and weights convergence analysis.

Inspired by large pre-trained\nlanguage models, this work introduces a paradigm for pre-training a general\npurpose representation that can serve as a starting point for multiple tasks on\na given robot. We present the Perception-Action Causal Transformer (PACT), a\ngenerative transformer-based architecture that aims to build representations\ndirectly from robot data in a self-supervised fashion. Through autoregressive\nprediction of states and actions over time, our model implicitly encodes\ndynamics and behaviors for a particular robot. Our experimental evaluation\nfocuses on the domain of mobile agents, where we show that this robot-specific\nrepresentation can function as a single starting point to achieve distinct\ntasks such as safe navigation, localization and mapping. We evaluate two form\nfactors: a wheeled robot that uses a LiDAR sensor as perception input (MuSHR),\nand a simulated agent that uses first-person RGB images (Habitat). We show that\nfinetuning small task-specific networks on top of the larger pretrained model\nresults in significantly better performance compared to training a single model\nfrom scratch for all tasks simultaneously, and comparable performance to\ntraining a separate large model for each task independently.

    "abstract": "How can we study social interactions on evolving topics at a mass scale? Over\nthe past decade, researchers from diverse fields such as economics, political\nscience, and public health have often done this by querying Twitter's public\nAPI endpoints with hand-picked topical keywords to search or stream\ndiscussions. However, despite the API's accessibility, it remains difficult to\nselect and update keywords to collect high-quality data relevant to topics of\ninterest. In this paper, we propose an active learning method for rapidly\nrefining query keywords to increase both the yielded topic relevance and\ndataset size. We leverage a large open-source COVID-19 Twitter dataset to\nillustrate the applicability of our method in tracking Tweets around the key\nsub-topics of Vaccine, Mask, and Lockdown. Our experiments show that our method\nachieves an average topic-related keyword recall 2x higher than baselines. We\nopen-source our code along with a web interface for keyword selection to make\ndata collection from Twitter more systematic for researchers.",

    "abstract": "Automated test generation based on symbolic execution can be beneficial for\nsystematically testing safety-critical software, to facilitate test engineers\nto pursue the strict testing requirements mandated by the certification\nstandards, while controlling at the same time the costs of the testing process.\nAt the same time, the development of safety-critical software is often\nconstrained with programming languages or coding conventions that ban\nlinguistic features which are believed to downgrade the safety of the programs,\ne.g., they do not allow dynamic memory allocation and variable-length arrays,\nlimit the way in which loops are used, forbid recursion, and bound the\ncomplexity of control conditions. As a matter of facts, these linguistic\nfeatures are also the main efficiency-blockers for the test generation\napproaches based on symbolic execution at the state of the art. This paper\ncontributes new evidence of the effectiveness of generating test cases with\nsymbolic execution for a significant class of industrial safety\ncritical-systems. We specifically focus on Scade, a largely adopted model-based\ndevelopment language for safety-critical embedded software, and we report on a\ncase study in which we exploited symbolic execution to automatically generate\ntest cases for a set of safety-critical programs developed in Scade. To this\nend, we introduce a novel test generator that we developed in a recent\nindustrial project on testing safety-critical railway software written in\nScade, and we report on our experience of using this test generator for testing\na set of Scade programs that belong to the development of an on-board signaling\nunit for high-speed rail.

Specialist models are\ncapable of learning to neurally execute either only one algorithm or a\ncollection of algorithms with identical control-flow backbone. Here, instead,\nwe focus on constructing a generalist neural algorithmic learner -- a single\ngraph neural network processor capable of learning to execute a wide range of\nalgorithms, such as sorting, searching, dynamic programming, path-finding and\ngeometry. We leverage the CLRS benchmark to empirically show that, much like\nrecent successes in the domain of perception, generalist algorithmic learners\ncan be built by \"incorporating\" knowledge. That is, it is possible to\neffectively learn algorithms in a multi-task manner, so long as we can learn to\nexecute them well in a single-task regime. Motivated by this, we present a\nseries of improvements to the input representation, training regime and\nprocessor architecture over CLRS, improving average single-task performance by\nover 20% from prior art. We then conduct a thorough ablation of multi-task\nlearners leveraging these improvements.

We\ninterpret the data points as electrical charges on the $z=0$ hyperplane in a\nspace augmented with an additional dimension $z$, generating a high-dimensional\nelectric field (the gradient of the solution to Poisson equation). We prove\nthat if these charges flow upward along electric field lines, their initial\ndistribution in the $z=0$ plane transforms into a distribution on the\nhemisphere of radius $r$ that becomes uniform in the $r \\to\\infty$ limit. To\nlearn the bijective transformation, we estimate the normalized field in the\naugmented space. For sampling, we devise a backward ODE that is anchored by the\nphysically meaningful additional dimension: the samples hit the unaugmented\ndata manifold when the $z$ reaches zero. Experimentally, PFGM achieves current\nstate-of-the-art performance among the normalizing flow models on CIFAR-10,\nwith an Inception score of $9.68$ and a FID score of $2.48$.

    "abstract": "Recently, sparse training has emerged as a promising paradigm for efficient\ndeep learning on edge devices. The current research mainly devotes efforts to\nreducing training costs by further increasing model sparsity. However,\nincreasing sparsity is not always ideal since it will inevitably introduce\nsevere accuracy degradation at an extremely high sparsity level. This paper\nintends to explore other possible directions to effectively and efficiently\nreduce sparse training costs while preserving accuracy. To this end, we\ninvestigate two techniques, namely, layer freezing and data sieving. First, the\nlayer freezing approach has shown its success in dense model training and\nfine-tuning, yet it has never been adopted in the sparse training domain.\nNevertheless, the unique characteristics of sparse training may hinder the\nincorporation of layer freezing techniques. Therefore, we analyze the\nfeasibility and potentiality of using the layer freezing technique in sparse\ntraining and find it has the potential to save considerable training costs.\nSecond, we propose a data sieving method for dataset-efficient training, which\nfurther reduces training costs by ensuring only a partial dataset is used\nthroughout the entire training process. We show that both techniques can be\nwell incorporated into the sparse training algorithm to form a generic\nframework, which we dub SpFDE. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SpFDE\ncan significantly reduce training costs while preserving accuracy from three\ndimensions: weight sparsity, layer freezing, and dataset sieving.",

Even though recent deep\nlearning-based tomato disease recognition methods with classical training\nprocedures showed promising recognition results, they demand large labelled\ndata and involve expensive training. The traditional deep learning models\nproposed for tomato disease recognition also consume high memory and storage\nbecause of a high number of parameters.

While policy learning methods offer a powerful\navenue to attack this problem, they require extensive per-task engineering and\nalgorithmic tuning. This paper seeks to escape these constraints, by developing\na Pre-Grasp informed Dexterous Manipulation (PGDM) framework that generates\ndiverse dexterous manipulation behaviors, without any task-specific reasoning\nor hyper-parameter tuning. At the core of PGDM is a well known robotics\nconstruct, pre-grasps (i.e. the hand-pose preparing for object interaction).\nThis simple primitive is enough to induce efficient exploration strategies for\nacquiring complex dexterous manipulation behaviors. To exhaustively verify\nthese claims, we introduce TCDM, a benchmark of 50 diverse manipulation tasks\ndefined over multiple objects and dexterous manipulators. Tasks for TCDM are\ndefined automatically using exemplar object trajectories from various sources\n(animators, human behaviors, etc.), without any per-task engineering and/or\nsupervision. Our experiments validate that PGDM's exploration strategy, induced\nby a surprisingly simple ingredient (single pre-grasp pose), matches the\nperformance of prior methods, which require expensive per-task feature/reward\nengineering, expert supervision, and hyper-parameter tuning.

Existing\nmethods assume that the examples illustrating a concept are mapped in a fixed\ndirection of the DNN's latent space. When this holds true, the concept can be\nrepresented by a concept activation vector (CAV) pointing in that direction. In\nthis work, we propose to relax this assumption by allowing concept examples to\nbe scattered across different clusters in the DNN's latent space. Each concept\nis then represented by a region of the DNN's latent space that includes these\nclusters and that we call concept activation region (CAR). To formalize this\nidea, we introduce an extension of the CAV formalism that is based on the\nkernel trick and support vector classifiers. This CAR formalism yields global\nconcept-based explanations and local concept-based feature importance. We prove\nthat CAR explanations built with radial kernels are invariant under latent\nspace isometries. In this way, CAR assigns the same explanations to latent\nspaces that have the same geometry. We further demonstrate empirically that\nCARs offer (1) more accurate descriptions of how concepts are scattered in the\nDNN's latent space; (2) global explanations that are closer to human concept\nannotations and (3) concept-based feature importance that meaningfully relate\nconcepts with each other.

Although a series of successful\nportrait image toonification models built upon the powerful StyleGAN have been\nproposed, these image-oriented methods have obvious limitations when applied to\nvideos, such as the fixed frame size, the requirement of face alignment,\nmissing non-facial details and temporal inconsistency. In this work, we\ninvestigate the challenging controllable high-resolution portrait video style\ntransfer by introducing a novel VToonify framework. Specifically, VToonify\nleverages the mid- and high-resolution layers of StyleGAN to render\nhigh-quality artistic portraits based on the multi-scale content features\nextracted by an encoder to better preserve the frame details. The resulting\nfully convolutional architecture accepts non-aligned faces in videos of\nvariable size as input, contributing to complete face regions with natural\nmotions in the output. Our framework is compatible with existing StyleGAN-based\nimage toonification models to extend them to video toonification, and inherits\nappealing features of these models for flexible style control on color and\nintensity. This work presents two instantiations of VToonify built upon Toonify\nand DualStyleGAN for collection-based and exemplar-based portrait video style\ntransfer, respectively.

    "abstract": "We study a variant of quantum hypothesis testing wherein an additional\n'inconclusive' measurement outcome is added, allowing one to abstain from\nattempting to discriminate the hypotheses. The error probabilities are then\nconditioned on a successful attempt, with inconclusive trials disregarded. We\ncompletely characterise this task in both the single-shot and asymptotic\nregimes, providing exact formulas for the optimal error probabilities. In\nparticular, we prove that the asymptotic error exponent of discriminating any\ntwo quantum states $\\rho$ and $\\sigma$ is given by the Hilbert projective\nmetric $D_{\\max}(\\rho\\|\\sigma) + D_{\\max}(\\sigma \\| \\rho)$ in asymmetric\nhypothesis testing, and by the Thompson metric $\\max \\{ D_{\\max}(\\rho\\|\\sigma),\nD_{\\max}(\\sigma \\| \\rho) \\}$ in symmetric hypothesis testing. This endows these\ntwo quantities with fundamental operational interpretations in quantum state\ndiscrimination. Our findings extend to composite hypothesis testing, where we\nshow that the asymmetric error exponent with respect to any convex set of\ndensity matrices is given by a regularisation of the Hilbert projective metric.\nWe apply our results also to quantum channels, showing that no advantage is\ngained by employing adaptive or even more general discrimination schemes over\nparallel ones, in both the asymmetric and symmetric settings. Our state\ndiscrimination results make use of no properties specific to quantum mechanics\nand are also valid in general probabilistic theories.",

It has been shown that ASR models tend to have\nmuch higher WER on speakers with speech impairments than typical English\nspeakers. It is hard to determine if models can be be useful at such high error\nrates. This study investigates the use of BERTScore, an evaluation metric for\ntext generation, to provide a more informative measure of ASR model quality and\nusefulness. Both BERTScore and WER were compared to prediction errors manually\nannotated by Speech Language Pathologists for error type and assessment.\nBERTScore was found to be more correlated with human assessment of error type\nand assessment. BERTScore was specifically more robust to orthographic changes\n(contraction and normalization errors) where meaning was preserved.\nFurthermore, BERTScore was a better fit of error assessment than WER, as\nmeasured using an ordinal logistic regression and the Akaike's Information\nCriterion (AIC). Overall, our findings suggest that BERTScore can complement\nWER when assessing ASR model performance from a practical perspective,\nespecially for accessibility applications where models are useful even at lower\naccuracy than for typical speech.",

In this work, we explore the computational benefits of\nmediating recurrent communication via interneurons compared with direct\nrecurrent connections. To this end, we consider two mathematically tractable\nrecurrent neural networks that statistically whiten their inputs -- one with\ndirect recurrent connections and the other with interneurons that mediate\nrecurrent communication. By analyzing the corresponding continuous synaptic\ndynamics and numerically simulating the networks, we show that the network with\ninterneurons is more robust to initialization than the network with direct\nrecurrent connections in the sense that the convergence time for the synaptic\ndynamics in the network with interneurons (resp. direct recurrent connections)\nscales logarithmically (resp. linearly) with the spectrum of their\ninitialization. Our results suggest that interneurons are computationally\nuseful for rapid adaptation to changing input statistics. Interestingly, the\nnetwork with interneurons is an overparameterized solution of the whitening\nobjective for the network with direct recurrent connections, so our results can\nbe viewed as a recurrent neural network analogue of the implicit acceleration\nphenomenon observed in overparameterized feedforward linear networks.",

We consider the setting where the\nrank of the ground-truth matrix is unknown a prior and use an overspecified\nfactored representation of the matrix variable, where the global optimal\nsolutions overfit and do not correspond to the underlying ground-truth. We then\nsolve the associated nonconvex problem using gradient descent with small random\ninitialization. We show that as long as the measurement operators satisfy the\nrestricted isometry property (RIP) with its rank parameter scaling with the\nrank of ground-truth matrix rather than scaling with the overspecified matrix\nvariable, gradient descent iterations are on a particular trajectory towards\nthe ground-truth matrix and achieve nearly information-theoretically optimal\nrecovery when stop appropriately. We then propose an efficient early stopping\nstrategy based on the common hold-out method and show that it detects nearly\noptimal estimator provably. Moreover, experiments show that the proposed\nvalidation approach can also be efficiently used for image restoration with\ndeep image prior which over-parameterizes an image with a deep network.",

    "abstract": "We present a Gaussian Process (GP) approach (Gaussian Process Hydrodynamics,\nGPH) for solving the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. As in Smoothed Particle\nHydrodynamics (SPH), GPH is a Lagrangian particle-based approach involving the\ntracking of a finite number of particles transported by the flow. However,\nthese particles do not represent mollified particles of matter but carry\ndiscrete/partial information about the continuous flow. Closure is achieved by\nplacing a divergence-free GP prior $\\xi$ on the velocity field and conditioning\non vorticity at particle locations. Known physics (e.g., the Richardson cascade\nand velocity-increments power laws) is incorporated into the GP prior through\nphysics-informed additive kernels. This is equivalent to expressing $\\xi$ as a\nsum of independent GPs $\\xi^l$, which we call modes, acting at different\nscales. This approach leads to a quantitative analysis of the Richardson\ncascade through the analysis of the activation of these modes and allows us to\ncoarse-grain turbulence in a statistical manner rather than a deterministic\none. Since GPH is formulated on the vorticity equations, it does not require\nsolving a pressure equation. By enforcing incompressibility and fluid/structure\nboundary conditions through the selection of the kernel, GPH requires much\nfewer particles than SPH. Since GPH has a natural probabilistic interpretation,\nnumerical results come with uncertainty estimates enabling their incorporation\ninto a UQ pipeline and the adding/removing of particles in an adapted manner.\nThe proposed approach is amenable to analysis, it inherits the complexity of\nstate-of-the-art solvers for dense kernel matrices, and it leads to a natural\ndefinition of turbulence as information loss. Numerical experiments support the\nimportance of selecting physics-informed kernels and illustrate the major\nimpact of such kernels on accuracy and stability.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have become the gold-standard approach for the automated\nsegmentation of 3D medical images. Their full acceptance by clinicians remains\nhowever hampered by the lack of intelligible uncertainty assessment of the\nprovided results. Most approaches to quantify their uncertainty, such as the\npopular Monte Carlo dropout, restrict to some measure of uncertainty in\nprediction at the voxel level. In addition not to be clearly related to genuine\nmedical uncertainty, this is not clinically satisfying as most objects of\ninterest (e.g. brain lesions) are made of groups of voxels whose overall\nrelevance may not simply reduce to the sum or mean of their individual\nuncertainties. In this work, we propose to go beyond voxel-wise assessment\nusing an innovative Graph Neural Network approach, trained from the outputs of\na Monte Carlo dropout model. This network allows the fusion of three estimators\nof voxel uncertainty: entropy, variance, and model's confidence; and can be\napplied to any lesion, regardless of its shape or size. We demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our approach for uncertainty estimate on a task of Multiple\nSclerosis lesions segmentation.",

Although a\nplethora of sparse methods has been proposed for other domains, such methods\nhave rarely been applied in TTS. In this work, we seek to answer the question:\nwhat are the characteristics of selected sparse techniques on the performance\nand model complexity? We compare a Tacotron2 baseline and the results of\napplying five techniques. We then evaluate the performance via the factors of\nnaturalness, intelligibility and prosody, while reporting model size and\ntraining time.

    "abstract": "Dimensionality reduction of decision variables is a practical and classic\nmethod to reduce the computational burden in linear and Nonlinear Model\nPredictive Control (NMPC). Available results range from early move-blocking\nideas to singular-value decomposition. For schemes more complex than\nmove-blocking it is seemingly not straightforward to guarantee recursive\nfeasibility of the receding-horizon optimization. Decomposing the space of\ndecision variables related to the inputs into active and inactive complements,\nthis paper proposes a general framework for effective feasibility-preserving\ndimensionality reduction in NMPC.

    "abstract": "In December 2019, the global pandemic COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, affected\nhuman life and the worldwide economy. Therefore, an efficient diagnostic system\nis required to control its spread. However, the automatic diagnostic system\nposes challenges with a limited amount of labeled data, minor contrast\nvariation, and high structural similarity between infection and background. In\nthis regard, a new two-phase deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based\ndiagnostic system is proposed to detect minute irregularities and analyze\nCOVID-19 infection. In the first phase, a novel SB-STM-BRNet CNN is proposed,\nincorporating a new channel Squeezed and Boosted (SB) and dilated\nconvolutional-based Split-Transform-Merge (STM) block to detect COVID-19\ninfected CT lungs images. The new STM blocks performed multi-path\nregion-smoothing and boundary operations, which helped to learn minor contrast\nvariation and global COVID-19 specific patterns. Furthermore, the diverse\nboosted channels are achieved using the SB and Transfer Learning concepts in\nSTM blocks to learn texture variation between COVID-19-specific and healthy\nimages. In the second phase, COVID-19 infected images are provided to the novel\nCOVID-CB-RESeg segmentation CNN to identify and analyze COVID-19 infectious\nregions. The proposed COVID-CB-RESeg methodically employed region-homogeneity,\nheterogeneity operations, and channel boosting using auxiliary channels in each\nencoder and decoder block to simultaneously learn the low illumination and\nboundaries of the COVID-19 infected region. The proposed diagnostic system\nyields good performance in terms of accuracy: 98.21 %, F-score: 98.24%, Dice\nSimilarity: 96.40 %, and IOU: 98.85 % for the COVID-19 infected region. The\nproposed diagnostic system would reduce the burden and strengthen the\nradiologist's decision for a fast and accurate COVID-19 diagnosis.",

This research presents a novel self-supervised method for mental\nworkload modelling from EEG data employing Deep Learning and a continuous brain\nrate, an index of cognitive activation, without requiring human declarative\nknowledge. This method is a convolutional recurrent neural network trainable\nwith spatially preserving spectral topographic head-maps from EEG data to fit\nthe brain rate variable. Findings demonstrate the capacity of the convolutional\nlayers to learn meaningful high-level representations from EEG data since\nwithin-subject models had a test Mean Absolute Percentage Error average of 11%.\nThe addition of a Long-Short Term Memory layer for handling sequences of\nhigh-level representations was not significant, although it did improve their\naccuracy. Findings point to the existence of quasi-stable blocks of learnt\nhigh-level representations of cognitive activation because they can be induced\nthrough convolution and seem not to be dependent on each other over time,\nintuitively matching the non-stationary nature of brain responses.\nAcross-subject models, induced with data from an increasing number of\nparticipants, thus containing more variability, obtained a similar accuracy to\nthe within-subject models. This highlights the potential generalisability of\nthe induced high-level representations across people, suggesting the existence\nof subject-independent cognitive activation patterns.

For higher FARs the differences in sensitive\ndistance shrink to the point where select machine learning submissions\noutperform traditional search algorithms at FARs $\\geq 200$ per month on some\ndatasets. Our results show that current machine learning search algorithms may\nalready be sensitive enough in limited parameter regions to be useful for some\nproduction settings. To improve the state-of-the-art, machine learning\nalgorithms need to reduce the false-alarm rates at which they are capable of\ndetecting signals and extend their validity to regions of parameter space where\nmodeled searches are computationally expensive to run. Based on our findings we\ncompile a list of research areas that we believe are the most important to\nelevate machine learning searches to an invaluable tool in gravitational-wave\nsignal detection.",

The corresponding abstract\nmachine model (AMM) would also contain a description of the appropriate error\nmodels associated with the gates, measurements and time evolution of the\nhardware. This information has been implemented as an extension of Qiskit.\nQiskit is an opensource software development toolkit (SDK) for simulating the\nquantum state of a quantum circuit on a system with Python 3.7+ and for running\nthe same circuits on prototype hardware within the IBM Quantum Lab. We\nintroduce the Bosonic Qiskit software to enable the simulation of hybrid\nqubit/bosonic systems using the existing Qiskit software development kit. This\nimplementation can be used for simulating new hybrid systems, verifying\nproposed physical systems, and modeling systems larger than can currently be\nconstructed. We also cover tutorials and example use cases included within the\nsoftware to study Jaynes- Cummings models, bosonic Hubbard models, plotting\nWigner functions and animations, and calculating maximum likelihood estimations\nusing Wigner functions.",

    "abstract": "Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological diseases, characterized by\ntransient and unprovoked events called epileptic seizures. Electroencephalogram\n(EEG) is an auxiliary method used to perform both the diagnosis and the\nmonitoring of epilepsy. Given the unexpected nature of an epileptic seizure,\nits prediction would improve patient care, optimizing the quality of life and\nthe treatment of epilepsy. Predicting an epileptic seizure implies the\nidentification of two distinct states of EEG in a patient with epilepsy: the\npreictal and the interictal. In this paper, we developed two deep learning\nmodels called Temporal Multi-Channel Transformer (TMC-T) and Vision Transformer\n(TMC-ViT), adaptations of Transformer-based architectures for multi-channel\ntemporal signals. Moreover, we accessed the impact of choosing different\npreictal duration, since its length is not a consensus among experts, and also\nevaluated how the sample size benefits each model. Our models are compared with\nfully connected, convolutional, and recurrent networks. The algorithms were\npatient-specific trained and evaluated on raw EEG signals from the CHB-MIT\ndatabase. Experimental results and statistical validation demonstrated that our\nTMC-ViT model surpassed the CNN architecture, state-of-the-art in seizure\nprediction.",

    "abstract": "AASM guidelines are the results of decades of efforts to try to standardize\nthe sleep scoring procedure as to have a commonly used methodology. The\nguidelines cover several aspects from the technical/digital specifications,\ne.g., recommended EEG derivations, to the sleep scoring rules, e.g., different\nrules for adults, children and infants. In the context of sleep scoring\nautomation, in the last decades, deep learning has demonstrated better\nperformance compared to many other approaches. In most of the cases, clinical\nknowledge and guidelines have been exploited to support the automated sleep\nscoring algorithms in solving the task. In this paper we show that, actually, a\ndeep learning based sleep scoring algorithm may not need to fully exploit the\nclinical knowledge or to strictly follow the AASM guidelines. Specifically, we\ndemonstrate that U-Sleep, a state-of-the-art sleep scoring algorithm, can be\nstrong enough to solve the scoring task even using clinically non-recommended\nor non-conventional derivations, and with no need to exploit information about\nthe chronological age of the subjects. We finally strengthen a well-known\nfinding that using data from multiple data centers always results in a better\nperforming model compared with training on a single cohort. Indeed, we show\nthat this latter statement is still valid even by increasing the size and the\nheterogeneity of the single data cohort.

However, lack of model interpretability remains an obstacle to\nwidespread adoption of artificial intelligence in healthcare. Using sleep as a\ncase study, we propose a generalizable method to combine clinical\ninterpretability with high accuracy derived from black-box deep learning.\nClinician-determined sleep stages from polysomnogram (PSG) remain the gold\nstandard for evaluating sleep quality. However, PSG manual annotation by\nexperts is expensive and time-prohibitive. We propose SERF, interpretable Sleep\nstaging using Embeddings, Rules, and Features to read PSG. SERF provides\ninterpretation of classified sleep stages through meaningful features derived\nfrom the AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events. In SERF,\nthe embeddings obtained from a hybrid of convolutional and recurrent neural\nnetworks are transposed to the interpretable feature space. These\nrepresentative interpretable features are used to train simple models like a\nshallow decision tree for classification. Model results are validated on two\npublicly available datasets.

    "abstract": "Clinical diagnosis of the eye is performed over multifarious data modalities\nincluding scalar clinical labels, vectorized biomarkers, two-dimensional fundus\nimages, and three-dimensional Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) scans.\nClinical practitioners use all available data modalities for diagnosing and\ntreating eye diseases like Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) or Diabetic Macular Edema\n(DME). Enabling usage of machine learning algorithms within the ophthalmic\nmedical domain requires research into the relationships and interactions\nbetween all relevant data over a treatment period. Existing datasets are\nlimited in that they neither provide data nor consider the explicit\nrelationship modeling between the data modalities. In this paper, we introduce\nthe Ophthalmic Labels for Investigating Visual Eye Semantics (OLIVES) dataset\nthat addresses the above limitation. This is the first OCT and near-IR fundus\ndataset that includes clinical labels, biomarker labels, disease labels, and\ntime-series patient treatment information from associated clinical trials. The\ndataset consists of 1268 near-IR fundus images each with at least 49 OCT scans,\nand 16 biomarkers, along with 4 clinical labels and a disease diagnosis of DR\nor DME. In total, there are 96 eyes' data averaged over a period of at least\ntwo years with each eye treated for an average of 66 weeks and 7 injections. We\nbenchmark the utility of OLIVES dataset for ophthalmic data as well as provide\nbenchmarks and concrete research directions for core and emerging machine\nlearning paradigms within medical image analysis.",

    "abstract": "Leveraging quantum effects in metrology such as entanglement and coherence\nallows one to measure parameters with enhanced sensitivity. However,\ntime-dependent noise can disrupt such Heisenberg-limited amplification. We\npropose a quantum-metrology method based on the quantum-signal-processing\nframework to overcome these realistic noise-induced limitations in practical\nquantum metrology. Our algorithm separates the gate parameter\n$\\varphi$~(single-qubit Z phase) that is susceptible to time-dependent error\nfrom the target gate parameter $\\theta$~(swap-angle between |10> and |01>\nstates) that is largely free of time-dependent error. Our method achieves an\naccuracy of $10^{-4}$ radians in standard deviation for learning $\\theta$ in\nsuperconducting-qubit experiments, outperforming existing alternative schemes\nby two orders of magnitude. We also demonstrate the increased robustness in\nlearning time-dependent gate parameters through fast Fourier transformation and\nsequential phase difference. We show both theoretically and numerically that\nthere is an interesting transition of the optimal metrology variance scaling as\na function of circuit depth $d$ from the pre-asymptotic regime $d \\ll 1/\\theta$\nto Heisenberg limit $d \\to \\infty$. Remarkably, in the pre-asymptotic regime\nour method's estimation variance on time-sensitive parameter $\\varphi$ scales\nfaster than the asymptotic Heisenberg limit as a function of depth,\n$\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\varphi})\\approx 1/d^4$.

It is well-known that a Euclidean set\nof fixed Gaussian volume that maximizes noise stability must be a half space.\nFor a partition of Euclidean space into $m>2$ parts each of Gaussian measure\n$1/m$, it is still unknown what sets maximize the sum of their noise\nstabilities. In this work, we classify partitions maximizing noise stability\nthat are also critical points for the derivative of noise stability with\nrespect to $\\rho$. We call a partition satisfying these conditions hyperstable.\nUner the assumption that a maximizing partition is hyperstable, we prove:\n* a (conditional) version of the Plurality is Stablest Conjecture for $3$ or\n$4$ candidates.\n* a (conditional) sharp Unique Games Hardness result for MAX-m-CUT for $m=3$\nor $4$\n* a (conditional) version of the Propeller Conjecture of Khot and Naor for\n$4$ sets.\nWe also show that a symmetric set that is hyperstable must be star-shaped.\nFor partitions of Euclidean space into $m>2$ parts of fixed (but perhaps\nunequal) Gaussian measure, the hyperstable property can only be satisfied when\nall of the parts have Gaussian measure $1/m$. So, as our main contribution, we\nhave identified a possible strategy for proving the full Plurality is Stablest\nConjecture and the full sharp hardness for MAX-m-CUT: to prove both statements,\nit suffices to show that sets maximizing noise stability are hyperstable. This\nlast point is crucial since any proof of the Plurality is Stablest Conjecture\nmust use a property that is special to partitions of sets into equal measures,\nsince the conjecture is false in the unequal measure case.",
