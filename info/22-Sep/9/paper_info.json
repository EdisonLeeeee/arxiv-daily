    "title": "Beyond Random Split for Assessing Statistical Model Performance",
    "abstract": "Even though a train/test split of the dataset randomly performed is a common\npractice, could not always be the best approach for estimating performance\ngeneralization under some scenarios. The fact is that the usual machine\nlearning methodology can sometimes overestimate the generalization error when a\ndataset is not representative or when rare and elusive examples are a\nfundamental aspect of the detection problem. In the present work, we analyze\nstrategies based on the predictors' variability to split in training and\ntesting sets. Such strategies aim at guaranteeing the inclusion of rare or\nunusual examples with a minimal loss of the population's representativeness and\nprovide a more accurate estimation about the generalization error when the\ndataset is not representative. Two baseline classifiers based on decision trees\nwere used for testing the four splitting strategies considered. Both\nclassifiers were applied on CTU19 a low-representative dataset for a network\nsecurity detection problem. Preliminary results showed the importance of\napplying the three alternative strategies to the Monte Carlo splitting strategy\nin order to get a more accurate error estimation on different but feasible\nscenarios.",

    "abstract": "This letter focuses on the problem of traffic state estimation for highway\nnetworks with junctions in the form of on- and off-ramps while maintaining\ndifferential privacy of traffic data. Two types of sensors are considered,\nfixed sensors such as inductive loop detectors and connected vehicles which\nprovide traffic density and speed data. The celebrated nonlinear second-order\nAw-Rascle- Zhang (ARZ) model is utilized to model the traffic dynamics. The\nmodel is formulated as a nonlinear state-space difference equation. Sensitivity\nrelations are derived for the given data which are then used to formulate a\ndifferentially private mechanism which adds a Gaussian noise to the data to\nmake it differentially private. A Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) approach is\nimplemented for traffic state estimation using a linearized ARZ model. MHE is\ncompared with Kalman Filter variants namely Extended Kalman Filter, Ensemble\nKalman Filter and Unscented Kalman Filter. Several research and engineering\nquestions are formulated and analysis is performed to find corresponding\nanswers.",

    "abstract": "We study the problems of counting copies and induced copies of a small\npattern graph $H$ in a large host graph $G$. Recent work fully classified the\ncomplexity of those problems according to structural restrictions on the\npatterns $H$. In this work, we address the more challenging task of analysing\nthe complexity for restricted patterns and restricted hosts. Specifically we\nask which families of allowed patterns and hosts imply fixed-parameter\ntractability, i.e., the existence of an algorithm running in time $f(H)\\cdot\n|G|^{O(1)}$ for some computable function $f$. Our main results present\nexhaustive and explicit complexity classifications for families that satisfy\nnatural closure properties. Among others, we identify the problems of counting\nsmall matchings and independent sets in subgraph-closed graph classes\n$\\mathcal{G}$ as our central objects of study and establish the following crisp\ndichotomies as consequences of the Exponential Time Hypothesis: (1) Counting\n$k$-matchings in a graph $G\\in\\mathcal{G}$ is fixed-parameter tractable if and\nonly if $\\mathcal{G}$ is nowhere dense. (2) Counting $k$-independent sets in a\ngraph $G\\in\\mathcal{G}$ is fixed-parameter tractable if and only if\n$\\mathcal{G}$ is nowhere dense. Moreover, we obtain almost tight conditional\nlower bounds if $\\mathcal{G}$ is somewhere dense, i.e., not nowhere dense.\nThese base cases of our classifications subsume a wide variety of previous\nresults on the matching and independent set problem, such as counting\n$k$-matchings in bipartite graphs (Curticapean, Marx; FOCS 14), in\n$F$-colourable graphs (Roth, Wellnitz; SODA 20), and in degenerate graphs\n(Bressan, Roth; FOCS 21), as well as counting $k$-independent sets in bipartite\ngraphs (Curticapean et al.; Algorithmica 19).",

Thus, this work aims\nto facilitate the creation of augmented sports videos by enabling analysts to\ndirectly create visualizations embedded in videos using insights expressed in\nnatural language. To achieve this goal, we propose a three-step approach - 1)\ndetecting visualizable entities in the text, 2) mapping these entities into\nvisualizations, and 3) scheduling these visualizations to play with the video -\nand analyzed 155 sports video clips and the accompanying commentaries for\naccomplishing these steps. Informed by our analysis, we have designed and\nimplemented Sporthesia, a proof-of-concept system that takes racket-based\nsports videos and textual commentaries as the input and outputs augmented\nvideos. We demonstrate Sporthesia's applicability in two exemplar scenarios,\ni.e., authoring augmented sports videos using text and augmenting historical\nsports videos based on auditory comments. A technical evaluation shows that\nSporthesia achieves high accuracy (F1-score of 0.9) in detecting visualizable\nentities in the text. An expert evaluation with eight sports analysts suggests\nhigh utility, effectiveness, and satisfaction with our language-driven\nauthoring method and provides insights for future improvement and\nopportunities.",

    "abstract": "Aircraft industry is constantly striving for more efficient design\noptimization methods in terms of human efforts, computation time, and resource\nconsumption. Hybrid surrogate optimization maintains high results quality while\nproviding rapid design assessments when both the surrogate model and the switch\nmechanism for eventually transitioning to the HF model are calibrated properly.\nFeedforward neural networks (FNNs) can capture highly nonlinear input-output\nmappings, yielding efficient surrogates for aircraft performance factors.\nHowever, FNNs often fail to generalize over the out-of-distribution (OOD)\nsamples, which hinders their adoption in critical aircraft design optimization.\nThrough SmOOD, our smoothness-based out-of-distribution detection approach, we\npropose to codesign a model-dependent OOD indicator with the optimized FNN\nsurrogate, to produce a trustworthy surrogate model with selective but credible\npredictions. Unlike conventional uncertainty-grounded methods, SmOOD exploits\ninherent smoothness properties of the HF simulations to effectively expose OODs\nthrough revealing their suspicious sensitivities, thereby avoiding\nover-confident uncertainty estimates on OOD samples. By using SmOOD, only\nhigh-risk OOD inputs are forwarded to the HF model for re-evaluation, leading\nto more accurate results at a low overhead cost. Three aircraft performance\nmodels are investigated. Results show that FNN-based surrogates outperform\ntheir Gaussian Process counterparts in terms of predictive performance.\nMoreover, SmOOD does cover averagely 85% of actual OODs on all the study cases.\nWhen SmOOD plus FNN surrogates are deployed in hybrid surrogate optimization\nsettings, they result in a decrease error rate of 34.65% and a computational\nspeed up rate of 58.36 times, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Coverage-guided fuzzing's aggressive, high-volume testing has helped reveal\ntens of thousands of software security flaws. While executing billions of test\ncases mandates fast code coverage tracing, the nature of binary-only targets\nleads to reduced tracing performance. A recent advancement in binary fuzzing\nperformance is Coverage-guided Tracing (CGT), which brings orders-of-magnitude\ngains in throughput by restricting the expense of coverage tracing to only when\nnew coverage is guaranteed. Unfortunately, CGT suits only a basic block\ncoverage granularity -- yet most fuzzers require finer-grain coverage metrics:\nedge coverage and hit counts. It is this limitation which prohibits nearly all\nof today's state-of-the-art fuzzers from attaining the performance benefits of\nCGT.\nThis paper tackles the challenges of adapting CGT to fuzzing's most\nubiquitous coverage metrics. We introduce and implement a suite of enhancements\nthat expand CGT's introspection to fuzzing's most common code coverage metrics,\nwhile maintaining its orders-of-magnitude speedup over conventional always-on\ncoverage tracing. We evaluate their trade-offs with respect to fuzzing\nperformance and effectiveness across 12 diverse real-world binaries (8 open-\nand 4 closed-source). On average, our coverage-preserving CGT attains\nnear-identical speed to the present block-coverage-only CGT, UnTracer; and\noutperforms leading binary- and source-level coverage tracers QEMU, Dyninst,\nRetroWrite, and AFL-Clang by 2-24x, finding more bugs in less time.",

We exploit this connection using a\ncoupled-encoder network to project frontal/profile face images into a common\nlatent embedding space. The proposed model forces the similarity of\nrepresentations in the embedding space by maximizing the mutual information\nbetween two views of the face. The proposed coupled-encoder benefits from three\ncontributions for matching faces with extreme pose disparities. First, we\nleverage our pose-aware contrastive learning to maximize the mutual information\nbetween frontal and profile representations of identities. Second, a memory\nbuffer, which consists of latent representations accumulated over past\niterations, is integrated into the model so it can refer to relatively much\nmore instances than the mini-batch size. Third, a novel pose-aware adversarial\ndomain adaptation method forces the model to learn an asymmetric mapping from\nprofile to frontal representation. In our framework, the coupled-encoder learns\nto enlarge the margin between the distribution of genuine and imposter faces,\nwhich results in high mutual information between different views of the same\nidentity. The effectiveness of the proposed model is investigated through\nextensive experiments, evaluations, and ablation studies on four benchmark\ndatasets, and comparison with the compelling state-of-the-art algorithms.",

This is not a trivial task as state-of-the-art\nchatbot models are trained on large, public datasets openly collected from the\nInternet. This paper presents a first-of-its-kind, large-scale measurement of\ntoxicity in chatbots. We show that publicly available chatbots are prone to\nproviding toxic responses when fed toxic queries. Even more worryingly, some\nnon-toxic queries can trigger toxic responses too. We then set out to design\nand experiment with an attack, ToxicBuddy, which relies on fine-tuning GPT-2 to\ngenerate non-toxic queries that make chatbots respond in a toxic manner. Our\nextensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that our attack is effective\nagainst public chatbot models and outperforms manually-crafted malicious\nqueries proposed by previous work. We also evaluate three defense mechanisms\nagainst ToxicBuddy, showing that they either reduce the attack performance at\nthe cost of affecting the chatbot's utility or are only effective at mitigating\na portion of the attack. This highlights the need for more research from the\ncomputer security and online safety communities to ensure that chatbot models\ndo not hurt their users.

The method\nspecifically overcomes the shortcomings typically associated with conventional\nsolutions including but not limited to component aging, modeling errors and\ninaccuracies in the estimation of wind speed patterns. It has been observed to\nbe especially successful in capturing power from wind transients; it modulates\nthe generator load and hence rotor torque load so that the rotor tip speed\nreaches the optimum value for the anticipated wind speed. This ratio of rotor\ntip speed to wind speed is known to be critical in wind power applications.

This method of class structure\n(peer-to-peer learning) has been proven effective for learning, as it promotes\nteamwork and collaboration, and enables active learning. HELM is a unique\nplatform as it provides an easy process for students to create, teach and learn\ntopics in a structured, peer-to-peer environment. Since HELM was created in\nApril 2020, it has gotten over 4000 student sign ups and 80 teachers, in 4\ncontinents around the world. HELM has grown from a simple\nwebsite-and-Google-Form platform to having a backend system coded with Python,\nSQL, JavaScript and HTML, hosted on an AWS service. This not only makes it\neasier for students to sign up (as the students' information is saved in an SQL\ndatabase, meaning they can sign up for classes without having to put in their\ninformation again, as well as getting automated emails about their classes),\nbut also makes it easier for teachers to teach (as supplemental processes such\nas creating Zoom links, class recording folders, sending emails to students,\netc. are done automatically). In addition, HELM has a recommendation machine\nlearning algorithm which suggests classes and subjects students would enjoy\ntaking, based on the previous classes a student has taken. This has created an\neasier experience for students to sign up for classes they are interested in.",

As a consequence,\nN3F is readily applicable to most neural rendering formulations, including\nvanilla NeRF and its extensions to complex dynamic scenes.

    "title": "Evaluating Temporal Patterns in Applied Infant Affect Recognition",
    "abstract": "Agents must monitor their partners' affective states continuously in order to\nunderstand and engage in social interactions. However, methods for evaluating\naffect recognition do not account for changes in classification performance\nthat may occur during occlusions or transitions between affective states. This\npaper addresses temporal patterns in affect classification performance in the\ncontext of an infant-robot interaction, where infants' affective states\ncontribute to their ability to participate in a therapeutic leg movement\nactivity. To support robustness to facial occlusions in video recordings, we\ntrained infant affect recognition classifiers using both facial and body\nfeatures. Next, we conducted an in-depth analysis of our best-performing models\nto evaluate how performance changed over time as the models encountered missing\ndata and changing infant affect. During time windows when features were\nextracted with high confidence, a unimodal model trained on facial features\nachieved the same optimal performance as multimodal models trained on both\nfacial and body features. However, multimodal models outperformed unimodal\nmodels when evaluated on the entire dataset. Additionally, model performance\nwas weakest when predicting an affective state transition and improved after\nmultiple predictions of the same affective state. These findings emphasize the\nbenefits of incorporating body features in continuous affect recognition for\ninfants. Our work highlights the importance of evaluating variability in model\nperformance both over time and in the presence of missing data when applying\naffect recognition to social interactions.",

    "abstract": "In software engineering, different approaches and machine learning models\nleverage different types of data: source code, textual information, historical\ndata. An important part of any project is its dependencies. The list of\ndependencies is relatively small but carries a lot of semantics with it, which\ncan be used to compare projects or make judgements about them.\nIn this paper, we focus on Python projects and their PyPi dependencies in the\nform of requirements.txt files. We compile a dataset of 7,132 Python projects\nand their dependencies, as well as use Git to pull their versions from previous\nyears. Using this data, we build 32-dimensional embeddings of libraries by\napplying Singular Value Decomposition to the co-occurrence matrix of projects\nand libraries. We then cluster the embeddings and study their semantic\nrelations.\nTo showcase the usefulness of such lightweight library embeddings, we\nintroduce a prototype tool for suggesting relevant libraries to a given\nproject. The tool computes project embeddings and uses dependencies of projects\nwith similar embeddings to form suggestions. To compare different library\nrecommenders, we have created a benchmark based on the evolution of dependency\nsets in open-source projects. Approaches based on the created embeddings\nsignificantly outperform the baseline of showing the most popular libraries in\na given year. We have also conducted a user study that showed that the\nsuggestions differ in quality for different project domains and that even\nrelevant suggestions might be not particularly useful. Finally, to facilitate\npotentially more useful recommendations, we extended the recommender system\nwith an option to suggest rarer libraries.",

    "abstract": "Effectively disassembling and recovering materials from waste electrical and\nelectronic equipment (WEEE) is a critical step in moving global supply chains\nfrom carbon-intensive, mined materials to recycled and renewable ones.\nConventional recycling processes rely on shredding and sorting waste streams,\nbut for WEEE, which is comprised of numerous dissimilar materials, we explore\ntargeted disassembly of numerous objects for improved material recovery. Many\nWEEE objects share many key features and therefore can look quite similar, but\ntheir material composition and internal component layout can vary, and thus it\nis critical to have an accurate classifier for subsequent disassembly steps for\naccurate material separation and recovery. This work introduces RGB-X, a\nmulti-modal image classification approach, that utilizes key features from\nexternal RGB images with those generated from X-ray images to accurately\nclassify electronic objects. More specifically, this work develops Iterative\nClass Activation Mapping (iCAM), a novel network architecture that explicitly\nfocuses on the finer-details in the multi-modal feature maps that are needed\nfor accurate electronic object classification. In order to train a classifier,\nelectronic objects lack large and well annotated X-ray datasets due to expense\nand need of expert guidance. To overcome this issue, we present a novel way of\ncreating a synthetic dataset using domain randomization applied to the X-ray\ndomain. The combined RGB-X approach gives us an accuracy of 98.6% on 10\ngenerations of modern smartphones, which is greater than their individual\naccuracies of 89.1% (RGB) and 97.9% (X-ray) independently.

    "abstract": "The electrical power grid is a critical infrastructure, with disruptions in\ntransmission having severe repercussions on daily activities, across multiple\nsectors. To identify, prevent, and mitigate such events, power grids are being\nrefurbished as 'smart' systems that include the widespread deployment of\nGPS-enabled phasor measurement units (PMUs). PMUs provide fast, precise, and\ntime-synchronized measurements of voltage and current, enabling real-time\nwide-area monitoring and control. However, the potential benefits of PMUs, for\nanalyzing grid events like abnormal power oscillations and load fluctuations,\nare hindered by the fact that these sensors produce large, concurrent volumes\nof noisy data. In this paper, we describe working with power grid engineers to\ninvestigate how this problem can be addressed from a visual analytics\nperspective. As a result, we have developed PMU Tracker, an event localization\ntool that supports power grid operators in visually analyzing and identifying\npower grid events and tracking their propagation through the power grid's\nnetwork. As a part of the PMU Tracker interface, we develop a novel\nvisualization technique which we term an epicentric cluster dendrogram, which\nallows operators to analyze the effects of an event as it propagates outwards\nfrom a source location. We robustly validate PMU Tracker with: (1) a usage\nscenario demonstrating how PMU Tracker can be used to analyze anomalous grid\nevents, and (2) case studies with power grid operators using a real-world\ninterconnection dataset. Our results indicate that PMU Tracker effectively\nsupports the analysis of power grid events; we also demonstrate and discuss how\nPMU Tracker's visual analytics approach can be generalized to other domains\ncomposed of time-varying networks with epicentric event characteristics.",

To help suppress the\ninfluence of gender bias, we analyzed the relationship between gender and code\nreading speed in the field of software development.

    "title": "CAP: instance complexity-aware network pruning",
    "abstract": "Existing differentiable channel pruning methods often attach scaling factors\nor masks behind channels to prune filters with less importance, and assume\nuniform contribution of input samples to filter importance. Specifically, the\neffects of instance complexity on pruning performance are not yet fully\ninvestigated. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective differentiable\nnetwork pruning method CAP based on instance complexity-aware filter importance\nscores. We define instance complexity related weight for each sample by giving\nhigher weights to hard samples, and measure the weighted sum of sample-specific\nsoft masks to model non-uniform contribution of different inputs, which\nencourages hard samples to dominate the pruning process and the model\nperformance to be well preserved. In addition, we introduce a new regularizer\nto encourage polarization of the masks, such that a sweet spot can be easily\nfound to identify the filters to be pruned. Performance evaluations on various\nnetwork architectures and datasets demonstrate CAP has advantages over the\nstate-of-the-arts in pruning large networks. For instance, CAP improves the\naccuracy of ResNet56 on CIFAR-10 dataset by 0.33% aftering removing 65.64%\nFLOPs, and prunes 87.75% FLOPs of ResNet50 on ImageNet dataset with only 0.89%\nTop-1 accuracy loss.",

    "abstract": "Most reinforcement learning algorithms implicitly assume strong synchrony. We\npresent novel attacks targeting Q-learning that exploit a vulnerability\nentailed by this assumption by delaying the reward signal for a limited time\nperiod. We consider two types of attack goals: targeted attacks, which aim to\ncause a target policy to be learned, and untargeted attacks, which simply aim\nto induce a policy with a low reward. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed\nattacks through a series of experiments. Our first observation is that\nreward-delay attacks are extremely effective when the goal is simply to\nminimize reward. Indeed, we find that even naive baseline reward-delay attacks\nare also highly successful in minimizing the reward. Targeted attacks, on the\nother hand, are more challenging, although we nevertheless demonstrate that the\nproposed approaches remain highly effective at achieving the attacker's\ntargets. In addition, we introduce a second threat model that captures a\nminimal mitigation that ensures that rewards cannot be used out of sequence. We\nfind that this mitigation remains insufficient to ensure robustness to attacks\nthat delay, but preserve the order, of rewards.",

    "abstract": "The popularity of Windows attracts the attention of hackers/cyber-attackers,\nmaking Windows devices the primary target of malware attacks in recent years.\nSeveral sophisticated malware variants and anti-detection methods have been\nsignificantly enhanced and as a result, traditional malware detection\ntechniques have become less effective. This work presents MalBehavD-V1, a new\nbehavioural dataset of Windows Application Programming Interface (API) calls\nextracted from benign and malware executable files using the dynamic analysis\napproach. In addition, we present MalDetConV, a new automated behaviour-based\nframework for detecting both existing and zero-day malware attacks. MalDetConv\nuses a text processing-based encoder to transform features of API calls into a\nsuitable format supported by deep learning models. It then uses a hybrid of\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional gated recurrent unit\n(CNN-BiGRU) automatic feature extractor to select high-level features of the\nAPI Calls which are then fed to a fully connected neural network module for\nmalware classification. MalDetConv also uses an explainable component that\nreveals features that contributed to the final classification outcome, helping\nthe decision-making process for security analysts. The performance of the\nproposed framework is evaluated using our MalBehavD-V1 dataset and other\nbenchmark datasets. The detection results demonstrate the effectiveness of\nMalDetConv over the state-of-the-art techniques with detection accuracy of\n96.10%, 95.73%, 98.18%, and 99.93% achieved while detecting unseen malware from\nMalBehavD-V1, Allan and John, Brazilian, and Ki-D datasets, respectively.

    "title": "Extractive is not Faithful: An Investigation of Broad Unfaithfulness  Problems in Extractive Summarization",
    "abstract": "The problems of unfaithful summaries have been widely discussed under the\ncontext of abstractive summarization. Though extractive summarization is less\nprone to the common unfaithfulness issues of abstractive summaries, does that\nmean extractive is equal to faithful? Turns out that the answer is no. In this\nwork, we define a typology with five types of broad unfaithfulness problems\n(including and beyond not-entailment) that can appear in extractive summaries,\nincluding incorrect coreference, incomplete coreference, incorrect discourse,\nincomplete discourse, as well as other misleading information. We ask humans to\nlabel these problems out of 1500 English summaries produced by 15 diverse\nextractive systems. We find that 33% of the summaries have at least one of the\nfive issues. To automatically detect these problems, we find that 5 existing\nfaithfulness evaluation metrics for summarization have poor correlations with\nhuman judgment. To remedy this, we propose a new metric, ExtEval, that is\ndesigned for detecting unfaithful extractive summaries and is shown to have the\nbest performance. We hope our work can increase the awareness of unfaithfulness\nproblems in extractive summarization and help future work to evaluate and\nresolve these issues.

    "abstract": "[Purpose] To understand the meaning of a sentence, humans can focus on\nimportant words in the sentence, which reflects our eyes staying on each word\nin different gaze time or times. Thus, some studies utilize eye-tracking values\nto optimize the attention mechanism in deep learning models. But these studies\nlack to explain the rationality of this approach. Whether the attention\nmechanism possesses this feature of human reading needs to be explored.\n[Design/methodology/approach] We conducted experiments on a sentiment\nclassification task. Firstly, we obtained eye-tracking values from two\nopen-source eye-tracking corpora to describe the feature of human reading.\nThen, the machine attention values of each sentence were learned from a\nsentiment classification model. Finally, a comparison was conducted to analyze\nmachine attention values and eye-tracking values. [Findings] Through\nexperiments, we found the attention mechanism can focus on important words,\nsuch as adjectives, adverbs, and sentiment words, which are valuable for\njudging the sentiment of sentences on the sentiment classification task. It\npossesses the feature of human reading, focusing on important words in\nsentences when reading. Due to the insufficient learning of the attention\nmechanism, some words are wrongly focused. The eye-tracking values can help the\nattention mechanism correct this error and improve the model performance.\n[Originality/value] Our research not only provides a reasonable explanation for\nthe study of using eye-tracking values to optimize the attention mechanism, but\nalso provides new inspiration for the interpretability of attention mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed significant success in Self-Supervised Learning\n(SSL), which facilitates various downstream tasks. However, attackers may steal\nsuch SSL models and commercialize them for profit, making it crucial to protect\ntheir Intellectual Property (IP). Most existing IP protection solutions are\ndesigned for supervised learning models and cannot be used directly since they\nrequire that the models' downstream tasks and target labels be known and\navailable during watermark embedding, which is not always possible in the\ndomain of SSL. To address such a problem especially when downstream tasks are\ndiverse and unknown during watermark embedding, we propose a novel black-box\nwatermarking solution, named SSL-WM, for protecting the ownership of SSL\nmodels. SSL-WM maps watermarked inputs by the watermarked encoders into an\ninvariant representation space, which causes any downstream classifiers to\nproduce expected behavior, thus allowing the detection of embedded watermarks.\nWe evaluate SSL-WM on numerous tasks, such as Computer Vision (CV) and Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP), using different SSL models, including\ncontrastive-based and generative-based. Experimental results demonstrate that\nSSL-WM can effectively verify the ownership of stolen SSL models in various\ndownstream tasks. Furthermore, SSL-WM is robust against model fine-tuning and\npruning attacks.

Alternatively to existing algorithms, we\npropose two simple algorithms that are more efficient statistically, simpler to\nimplement and computationally cheaper.

    "abstract": "Template-based synthesis, also known as sketching, is a localized approach to\nprogram synthesis in which the programmer provides not only a specification,\nbut also a high-level ``sketch'' of the program. The sketch is basically a\npartial program that models the general intuition of the programmer, while\nleaving the low-level details as unimplemented ``holes''. The role of the\nsynthesis engine is then to fill in these holes such that the completed program\nsatisfies the desired specification. In this work, we focus on template-based\nsynthesis of polynomial imperative programs with real variables,\ni.e.~imperative programs in which all expressions appearing in assignments,\nconditions and guards are polynomials over program variables. While this\nproblem can be solved in a sound and complete manner by a reduction to the\nfirst-order theory of the reals, the resulting formulas will contain a\nquantifier alternation and are extremely hard for modern SMT solvers, even when\nconsidering toy programs with a handful of lines. Moreover, the classical\nalgorithms for quantifier elimination are notoriously unscalable and not at all\napplicable to this use-case.\nIn contrast, our main contribution is an algorithm, based on several\nwell-known theorems in polyhedral and real algebraic geometry, namely Putinar's\nPositivstellensatz, the Real Nullstellensatz, Handelman's Theorem and Farkas'\nLemma, which sidesteps the quantifier elimination difficulty and reduces the\nproblem directly to Quadratic Programming (QP). Alternatively, one can view our\nalgorithm as an efficient way of eliminating quantifiers in the particular\nformulas that appear in the synthesis problem. The resulting QP instances can\nthen be handled quite easily by SMT solvers. Notably, our reduction to QP is\nsound and semi-complete, i.e.~it is complete if polynomials of a sufficiently\nhigh degree are used in the templates...",

The\navailability of data interfaces, which allow this kind of connectivity, has the\npotential to distinguish artificial agents' capabilities in connected,\ncooperative, and automated mobility systems from the capabilities of human\noperators, who do not possess such interfaces. Connected agents can for example\nshare data to build collective environment models, plan collective behavior,\nand learn collectively from the shared data that is centrally combined. This\npaper presents multiple solutions that allow connected entities to exchange\ndata.

    "abstract": "The hierarchical caching system where a server connects with multiple mirror\nsites, each connecting with a distinct set of users, and both the mirror sites\nand users are equipped with caching memories has been widely studied. However\nall the existing works focus on single file retrieval, i.e., each user requests\none file, and ignore the security and privacy threats in communications. In\nthis paper we investigate the linear function retrieval problem for\nhierarchical caching systems with content security and demand privacy, i.e.,\neach user requests a linear combination of files, and meanwhile the files in\nthe library are protected against wiretappers and users' demands are kept\nunknown to other users and unconnected mirror sites. First we propose a new\ncombination structure named hierarchical placement delivery array (HPDA), which\ncharacterizes the data placement and delivery strategy of a coded caching\nscheme. Then we construct two classes of HPDAs. Consequently two classes of\nschemes with or without security and privacy are obtained respectively where\nthe first dedicates to minimizing the transmission load for the first hop and\ncan achieve the optimal transmission load for the first hop if ignoring the\nsecurity and privacy constraints; the second has more flexible parameters on\nthe memory sizes and a lower subpacketization compared with the first one, and\nachieves a tradeoff between subpacketization and transmission loads.",

The scheme is established by combining\na modified Crank-Nicolson approximation and the Adams-Bashforth extrapolation\nfor the temporal discretization, and by applying the Fourier spectral\ncollocation to the spatial discretization. In addition, two stabilization terms\nin different forms are added for the sake of the numerical stability. We\nconduct a complete convergence analysis by using the higher-order consistency\nestimate for the numerical scheme, combined with the rough error estimate and\nthe refined estimate. By regarding the numerical solution as a small\nperturbation of the exact solution, we are able to justify the discrete\n$\\ell^\\infty$ bound of the numerical solution, as a result of the rough error\nestimate. Subsequently, the refined error estimate is derived to obtain the\noptimal rate of convergence, following the established $\\ell^\\infty$ bound of\nthe numerical solution. Moreover, the energy stability is also rigorously\nproved with respect to a modified energy. The proposed scheme can be viewed as\nthe generalization of the second-order scheme presented in an earlier work, and\nthe energy stability estimate has greatly improved the corresponding result\ntherein.",

This underlines the necessity to explicitly evaluate\nand finetune FMs on such expert tasks, arguably ones that appear the most in\npractical real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a first of its\nkind FETA benchmark built around the task of teaching FMs to understand\ntechnical documentation, via learning to match their graphical illustrations to\ncorresponding language descriptions. Our FETA benchmark focuses on\ntext-to-image and image-to-text retrieval in public car manuals and sales\ncatalogue brochures. FETA is equipped with a procedure for completely automatic\nannotation extraction (code would be released upon acceptance), allowing easy\nextension of FETA to more documentation types and application domains in the\nfuture. Our automatic annotation leads to an automated performance metric shown\nto be consistent with metrics computed on human-curated annotations (also\nreleased). We provide multiple baselines and analysis of popular FMs on FETA\nleading to several interesting findings that we believe would be very valuable\nto the FM community, paving the way towards real-world application of FMs for\npractical expert tasks currently 'overlooked' by standard benchmarks focusing\non common objects.",

The key parts are the heuristics for pruning the state\nspace (detecting dead ends) and heuristics for choosing the most promising\nbranches to continue the search.\nThese two algorithms have been tested with 20 different Watson-Crick grammars\n(40 including their Chomsky normal form versions). While WK-CYK is able to\ndecide the language membership in a reasonable time for inputs of the length of\nroughly 30-50 symbols and its performance is very consistent for all kinds of\ngrammars and inputs, the state space search is usually (89-98 % of cases) more\nefficient and able to do the computation for inputs with lengths of hundreds or\neven thousands of symbols.

Our core objective is to constrain the gap between the internal\ndistributions of the reference and syntheses by sliced Wasserstein distance. To\nbetter achieve it, style fixation is used at first to roughly obtain the\nexemplary style, and an auxiliary network is introduced to the original\ngenerator to disentangle entity and style transfer.

This work proposed a novel LiDAR-inertial-visual fusion\nframework termed R$^3$LIVE++ to achieve robust and accurate state estimation\nwhile simultaneously reconstructing the radiance map on the fly. R$^3$LIVE++\nconsists of a LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) and a visual-inertial odometry\n(VIO), both running in real-time. The LIO subsystem utilizes the measurements\nfrom a LiDAR for reconstructing the geometric structure (i.e., the positions of\n3D points), while the VIO subsystem simultaneously recovers the radiance\ninformation of the geometric structure from the input images. R$^3$LIVE++ is\ndeveloped based on R$^3$LIVE and further improves the accuracy in localization\nand mapping by accounting for the camera photometric calibration (e.g.,\nnon-linear response function and lens vignetting) and the online estimation of\ncamera exposure time.

The goal is to predict the\nunknown parameters and use the estimates to solve for an estimated optimal\nsolution to the optimization problem. However, all prior works have focused on\nthe case where unknown parameters appear only in the optimization objective and\nnot the constraints, for the simple reason that if the constraints were not\nknown exactly, the estimated optimal solution might not even be feasible under\nthe true parameters. The contributions of this paper are two-fold.

    "abstract": "Networks of social interactions are the substrate upon which civilizations\nare built. Often, we create new bonds with people that we like or feel that our\nrelationships are damaged through the intervention of third parties. Despite\ntheir importance and the huge impact that these processes have in our lives,\nquantitative scientific understanding of them is still in its infancy, mainly\ndue to the difficulty of collecting large datasets of social networks including\nindividual attributes. In this work, we present a thorough study of real social\nnetworks of 13 schools, with more than 3,000 students and 60,000 declared\npositive and negative relations, including tests for personal traits of all the\nstudents. We introduce a metric -- the `triadic influence' -- that measures the\ninfluence of nearest-neighbors in the relationships of their contacts. We use\nneural networks to predict the relationships and to extract the probability\nthat two students are friends or enemies depending on their personal attributes\nor the triadic influence. We alternatively use a high-dimensional embedding of\nthe network structure to also predict the relationships. Remarkably, the\ntriadic influence (a simple one-dimensional metric) achieves the highest\naccuracy at predicting the relationship between two students. We postulate that\nthe probabilities extracted from the neural networks -- functions of the\ntriadic influence and the personalities of the students -- control the\nevolution of real social networks, opening a new avenue for the quantitative\nstudy of these systems.",

    "abstract": "With an increased amount and availability of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)\nand other remote sensing devices (e.g. satellites), we have recently seen a\nvast increase in computer vision methods for aerial view data. One application\nof such technologies is within search-and-rescue (SAR), where the task is to\nlocalize and assist one or several people who are missing, for example after a\nnatural disaster. In many cases the rough location may be known and a UAV can\nbe deployed to explore a given, confined area to precisely localize the missing\npeople. Due to time and battery constraints it is often critical that\nlocalization is performed as efficiently as possible. In this work, we approach\nthis type of problem by abstracting it as an aerial view goal localization task\nin a framework that emulates a SAR-like setup without requiring access to\nactual UAVs. In this framework, an agent operates on top of an aerial image\n(proxy for a search area) and is tasked with localizing a goal that is\ndescribed in terms of visual cues. To further mimic the situation on an actual\nUAV, the agent is not able to observe the search area in its entirety, not even\nat low resolution, and thus it has to operate solely based on partial glimpses\nwhen navigating towards the goal. To tackle this task, we propose AiRLoc, a\nreinforcement learning (RL)-based model that decouples exploration (searching\nfor distant goals) and exploitation (localizing nearby goals). Extensive\nevaluations show that AiRLoc outperforms heuristic search methods as well as\nalternative learnable approaches. We also conduct a proof-of-concept study\nwhich indicates that the learnable methods outperform humans on average. Code\nhas been made publicly available: https://github.com/aleksispi/airloc.",

The intrinsic domain of such parameters is the unit sphere, and\ntherefore their gradient optimization dynamics can be represented via spherical\noptimization with varying effective learning rate (ELR), which was studied\npreviously. In this work, we investigate the properties of training\nscale-invariant neural networks directly on the sphere using a fixed ELR. We\ndiscover three regimes of such training depending on the ELR value:\nconvergence, chaotic equilibrium, and divergence. We study these regimes in\ndetail both on a theoretical examination of a toy example and on a thorough\nempirical analysis of real scale-invariant deep learning models. Each regime\nhas unique features and reflects specific properties of the intrinsic loss\nlandscape, some of which have strong parallels with previous research on both\nregular and scale-invariant neural networks training.

The\nexpected and rapid electrification of residential heating and mobility sectors\nwill drive the existing distribution grid assets beyond their planned operating\nconditions. This change will also reveal new flexibility possibilities through\nsector coupling and end-user prosumer coordination. These options can be\ncollectively harnessed to alleviate the wide-scale LV grid reinforcement needs.\nHowever, the size of the planning and optimization problem can now grow to\nintractable levels even for commercial solvers. Additionally, the presumption\nof complete coordination within the distribution system is far from the current\nreality. In this work, we apply a multi-level approach, separating the planning\nand operation stages of the systems with different temporal scales. This\nreduces the computational burden and also simulates the realistic level of\nsystem coordination for an LV distribution grid. Case studies conducted for a\nrepresentative rural grid in Germany clearly show a high economic potential in\nthe flexible operation of buildings with increased integration of photovoltaics\nand reduced capacity sizing of heat pumps.

    "abstract": "Despite that leveraging the transferability of adversarial examples can\nattain a fairly high attack success rate for non-targeted attacks, it does not\nwork well in targeted attacks since the gradient directions from a source image\nto a targeted class are usually different in different DNNs. To increase the\ntransferability of target attacks, recent studies make efforts in aligning the\nfeature of the generated adversarial example with the feature distributions of\nthe targeted class learned from an auxiliary network or a generative\nadversarial network. However, these works assume that the training dataset is\navailable and require a lot of time to train networks, which makes it hard to\napply to real-world scenarios. In this paper, we revisit adversarial examples\nwith targeted transferability from the perspective of universality and find\nthat highly universal adversarial perturbations tend to be more transferable.\nBased on this observation, we propose the Locality of Images (LI) attack to\nimprove targeted transferability. Specifically, instead of using the\nclassification loss only, LI introduces a feature similarity loss between\nintermediate features from adversarial perturbed original images and randomly\ncropped images, which makes the features from adversarial perturbations to be\nmore dominant than that of benign images, hence improving targeted\ntransferability. Through incorporating locality of images into optimizing\nperturbations, the LI attack emphasizes that targeted perturbations should be\nuniversal to diverse input patterns, even local image patches. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that LI can achieve high success rates for\ntransfer-based targeted attacks. On attacking the ImageNet-compatible dataset,\nLI yields an improvement of 12\\% compared with existing state-of-the-art\nmethods.",

However, these\nmodels cannot be easily transferred from one region or data source to another\ndue to differences in image acquisition. To address this issue known as domain\nshift and foster the development of PV array mapping pipelines, we propose a\ndataset containing aerial images, annotations, and segmentation masks. We\nprovide installation metadata for more than 28,000 installations. We provide\nground truth segmentation masks for 13,000 installations, including 7,000 with\nannotations for two different image providers. Finally, we provide installation\nmetadata that matches the annotation for more than 8,000 installations. Dataset\napplications include end-to-end PV registry construction, robust PV\ninstallations mapping, and analysis of crowdsourced datasets.",

    "title": "Developing a multi-variate prediction model for the detection of  COVID-19 from Crowd-sourced Respiratory Voice Data",
    "abstract": "COVID-19 has affected more than 223 countries worldwide. There is a pressing\nneed for non invasive, low costs and highly scalable solutions to detect\nCOVID-19, especially in low-resource countries where PCR testing is not\nubiquitously available. Our aim is to develop a deep learning model identifying\nCOVID-19 using voice data recordings spontaneously provided by the general\npopulation (voice recordings and a short questionnaire) via their personal\ndevices. The novelty of this work is in the development of a deep learning\nmodel for the identification of COVID-19 patients from voice recordings.\nMethods: We used the Cambridge University dataset consisting of 893 audio\nsamples, crowd-sourced from 4352 participants that used a COVID-19 Sounds app.\nVoice features were extracted using a Mel-spectrogram analysis. Based on the\nvoice data, we developed deep learning classification models to detect positive\nCOVID-19 cases. These models included Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN). We compared their predictive power to\nbaseline classification models, namely Logistic Regression and Support Vector\nMachine. Results: LSTM based on a Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC)\nfeatures achieved the highest accuracy (89%,) with a sensitivity and\nspecificity of respectively 89% and 89%, The results achieved with the proposed\nmodel suggest a significant improvement in the prediction accuracy of COVID-19\ndiagnosis compared to the results obtained in the state of the art. Conclusion:\nDeep learning can detect subtle changes in the voice of COVID-19 patients with\npromising results. As an addition to the current testing techniques this model\nmay aid health professionals in fast diagnosis and tracing of COVID-19 cases\nusing simple voice analysis",

    "abstract": "Overfitting has long been considered a common issue to large neural network\nmodels in sequential recommendation. In our study, an interesting phenomenon is\nobserved that overfitting is temporary. When the model scale is increased, the\ntrend of the performance firstly ascends, then descends (i.e., overfitting) and\nfinally ascends again, which is named as double ascent in this paper. We\ntherefore raise an assumption that a considerably larger model will generalise\nbetter with a higher performance. In an extreme case to infinite-width,\nperformance is expected to reach the limit of this specific structure.\nUnfortunately, it is impractical to directly build a huge model due to the\nlimit of resources. In this paper, we propose the Overparameterised Recommender\n(OverRec), which utilises a recurrent neural tangent kernel (RNTK) as a\nsimilarity measurement for user sequences to successfully bypass the\nrestriction of hardware for huge models. We further prove that the RNTK for the\ntied input-output embeddings in recommendation is the same as the RNTK for\ngeneral untied input-output embeddings, which makes RNTK theoretically suitable\nfor recommendation. Since the RNTK is analytically derived, OverRec does not\nrequire any training, avoiding physically building the huge model. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted on four datasets, which verifies the state-of-the-art\nperformance of OverRec.",

    "abstract": "As wireless has disrupted communications, wireless will also disrupt the\ndelivery of energy. Future wireless networks will be equipped with (radiative)\nwireless power transfer (WPT) capability and exploit radio waves to carry both\nenergy and information through a unified wireless information and power\ntransfer (WIPT). Such networks will make the best use of the RF spectrum and\nradiation as well as the network infrastructure for the dual purpose of\ncommunicating and energizing. Consequently those networks will enable trillions\nof future low-power devices to sense, compute, connect, and energize anywhere,\nanytime, and on the move. In this paper, we review the foundations of such\nfuture system. We first give an overview of the fundamental theoretical\nbuilding blocks of WPT and WIPT. Then we discuss some state-of-the-art\nexperimental setups and prototypes of both WPT and WIPT and contrast\ntheoretical and experimental results. We draw a special attention to how the\nintegration of RF, signal and system designs in WPT and WIPT leads to new\ntheoretical and experimental design challenges for both microwave and\ncommunication engineers and highlight some promising solutions. Topics and\nexperimental testbeds discussed include closed-loop WPT and WIPT architectures\nwith beamforming, waveform, channel acquisition, and single/multi-antenna\nenergy harvester, centralized and distributed WPT, reconfigurable metasurfaces\nand intelligent surfaces for WPT, transmitter and receiver architecture for\nWIPT, modulation, rate-energy trade-off.

    "abstract": "Approaches to machine generated text detection tend to focus on binary\nclassification of human versus machine written text. In the scientific domain\nwhere publishers might use these models to examine manuscripts under\nsubmission, misclassification has the potential to cause harm to authors.\nAdditionally, authors may appropriately use text generation models such as with\nthe use of assistive technologies like translation tools. In this setting, a\nbinary classification scheme might be used to flag appropriate uses of\nassistive text generation technology as simply machine generated which is a\ncause of concern. In our work, we simulate this scenario by presenting a\nstate-of-the-art detector trained on the DAGPap22 with machine translated\npassages from Scielo and find that the model performs at random. Given this\nfinding, we develop a framework for dataset development that provides a nuanced\napproach to detecting machine generated text by having labels for the type of\ntechnology used such as for translation or paraphrase resulting in the\nconstruction of SynSciPass. By training the same model that performed well on\nDAGPap22 on SynSciPass, we show that not only is the model more robust to\ndomain shifts but also is able to uncover the type of technology used for\nmachine generated text. Despite this, we conclude that current datasets are\nneither comprehensive nor realistic enough to understand how these models would\nperform in the wild where manuscript submissions can come from many unknown or\nnovel distributions, how they would perform on scientific full-texts rather\nthan small passages, and what might happen when there is a mix of appropriate\nand inappropriate uses of natural language generation.",

    "title": "Automatic fetal fat quantification from MRI",
    "abstract": "Normal fetal adipose tissue (AT) development is essential for perinatal\nwell-being. AT, or simply fat, stores energy in the form of lipids.\nMalnourishment may result in excessive or depleted adiposity. Although previous\nstudies showed a correlation between the amount of AT and perinatal outcome,\nprenatal assessment of AT is limited by lacking quantitative methods. Using\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 3D fat- and water-only images of the entire\nfetus can be obtained from two point Dixon images to enable AT lipid\nquantification. This paper is the first to present a methodology for developing\na deep learning based method for fetal fat segmentation based on Dixon MRI. It\noptimizes radiologists' manual fetal fat delineation time to produce annotated\ntraining dataset. It consists of two steps: 1) model-based semi-automatic fetal\nfat segmentations, reviewed and corrected by a radiologist; 2) automatic fetal\nfat segmentation using DL networks trained on the resulting annotated dataset.\nThree DL networks were trained. We show a significant improvement in\nsegmentation times (3:38 hours to < 1 hour) and observer variability (Dice of\n0.738 to 0.906) compared to manual segmentation. Automatic segmentation of 24\ntest cases with the 3D Residual U-Net, nn-UNet and SWIN-UNetR transformer\nnetworks yields a mean Dice score of 0.863, 0.787 and 0.856, respectively.\nThese results are better than the manual observer variability, and comparable\nto automatic adult and pediatric fat segmentation. A radiologist reviewed and\ncorrected six new independent cases segmented using the best performing\nnetwork, resulting in a Dice score of 0.961 and a significantly reduced\ncorrection time of 15:20 minutes. Using these novel segmentation methods and\nshort MRI acquisition time, whole body subcutaneous lipids can be quantified\nfor individual fetuses in the clinic and large-cohort research.",

To cope with the scale of online misinformation, one viable\nsolution is to automate the fact-checking of claims by retrieving and verifying\nagainst relevant evidence. While major recent advances have been achieved in\npushing forward the automatic fact-verification, a comprehensive evaluation of\nthe possible attack vectors against such systems is still lacking.\nParticularly, the automated fact-verification process might be vulnerable to\nthe exact disinformation campaigns it is trying to combat. In this work, we\nassume an adversary that automatically tampers with the online evidence in\norder to disrupt the fact-checking model via camouflaging the relevant\nevidence, or planting a misleading one. We first propose an exploratory\ntaxonomy that spans these two targets and the different threat model\ndimensions. Guided by this, we design and propose several potential attack\nmethods. We show that it is possible to subtly modify claim-salient snippets in\nthe evidence, in addition to generating diverse and claim-aligned evidence. As\na result, we highly degrade the fact-checking performance under many different\npermutations of the taxonomy's dimensions. The attacks are also robust against\npost-hoc modifications of the claim. Our analysis further hints at potential\nlimitations in models' inference when faced with contradicting evidence.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce novel lightweight generative adversarial\nnetworks, which can effectively capture long-range dependencies in the image\ngeneration process, and produce high-quality results with a much simpler\narchitecture. To achieve this, we first introduce a long-range module, allowing\nthe network to dynamically adjust the number of focused sampling pixels and to\nalso augment sampling locations. Thus, it can break the limitation of the fixed\ngeometric structure of the convolution operator, and capture long-range\ndependencies in both spatial and channel-wise directions. Also, the proposed\nlong-range module can highlight negative relations between pixels, working as a\nregularization to stabilize training. Furthermore, we propose a new generation\nstrategy through which we introduce metadata into the image generation process\nto provide basic information about target images, which can stabilize and speed\nup the training process. Our novel long-range module only introduces few\nadditional parameters and is easily inserted into existing models to capture\nlong-range dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate the competitive\nperformance of our method with a lightweight architecture.",

Using a local curvilinear\nreference system anchored on the bottom surface, we develop an effective\nfirst-order and high-resolution space-time discretization of the no-flow\nsurfaces and solve a Lagrangian initial value problem that describes the\nevolution of the balance laws governing the geometrically intrinsic shallow\nwater equations.

A\nmyriad of soft robotic manipulators have been proposed in the literature, but\ntheir designs tend to be relatively similar, and generally offer a relatively\nlow force. This limits the payload they can carry and therefore their\nusability. A comparison of force of the different designs is not available\nunder a common framework, and designs present different diameters and features\nthat make them hard to compare. In this paper, we present the design of a soft\nrobotic manipulator that is optimised to maximise its force while respecting\ntypical application constraints such as size, workspace, payload capability,\nand maximum pressure. The design presented here has the advantage that it\nmorphs to an optimal design as it is pressurised to move in different\ndirections, and this leads to higher lateral force. The robot is designed using\na set of principles and thus can be adapted to other applications. We also\npresent a non-dimensional analysis for soft robotic manipulators, and we apply\nit to compare the performance of the design proposed here with other designs in\nthe literature. We show that our design has a higher force than other designs\nin the same category. Experimental results confirm the higher force of our\nproposed design.",

However,\nthe high computational cost of AT prohibits the deployment of large-scale AT on\nresource-constrained edge devices, e.g., with limited computing power and small\nmemory footprint, in Federated Learning (FL) applications. Very few previous\nstudies have tried to tackle these constraints in FL at the same time. In this\npaper, we propose a new framework named Federated Adversarial Decoupled\nLearning (FADE) to enable AT on resource-constrained edge devices in FL. FADE\nreduces the computation and memory usage by applying Decoupled Greedy Learning\n(DGL) to federated adversarial training such that each client only needs to\nperform AT on a small module of the entire model in each communication round.\nIn addition, we improve vanilla DGL by adding an auxiliary weight decay to\nalleviate objective inconsistency and achieve better performance. FADE offers a\ntheoretical guarantee for the adversarial robustness and convergence. The\nexperimental results also show that FADE can significantly reduce the computing\nresources consumed by AT while maintaining almost the same accuracy and\nrobustness as fully joint training.",

The layer potentials can be accurately and\nefficiently evaluated everywhere in the plane by means of existing methods\n(e.g. the density interpolation method), while the regularized volume integral\ncan be accurately evaluated by applying elementary quadrature rules.\nPreliminary numerical examples based on non-overlapping quadrilateral patch\nrepresentations of the domain in conjunction with Chebyshev-grid\ndiscretizations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

    "title": "Assessing Active Distribution Network Flexibility: On the Effects of  Nonlinearities and Nonconvexities",
    "abstract": "A widespread approach to characterise the aggregated flexibility of active\ndistribution networks (ADNs) is to estimate the boundary of the feasible\nnetwork operating areas using convex polygons in the P-Q space. However, such\napproximations can be inaccurate under realistic conditions where, for example,\nthe nonlinear nature of the network is captured, and the behaviour of flexible\nunits is constrained. This letter demonstrates, using a small ADN example with\nfour flexible units and considering only nonlinearities from the network, that\nreaching the full P-Q flexibility areas would require perfect coordination of\nunits and high ramping rates. Without these requirements, the P-Q areas become\nnonconvex. Thus, if the effects of nonlinearities and nonconvexities are\nignored, existing approaches in the literature can result in overestimation of\nADN flexibility and give rise to impractical solutions, hampering coordination\nbetween transmission and distribution system operators.",

    "abstract": "Fingerprint feature extraction is a task that is solved using either a global\nor a local representation. State-of-the-art global approaches use heavy deep\nlearning models to process the full fingerprint image at once, which makes the\ncorresponding approach memory intensive. On the other hand, local approaches\ninvolve minutiae based patch extraction, multiple feature extraction steps and\nan expensive matching stage, which make the corresponding approach time\nintensive. However, both these approaches provide useful and sometimes\nexclusive insights for solving the problem. Using both approaches together for\nextracting fingerprint representations is semantically useful but quite\ninefficient. Our convolutional transformer based approach with an in-built\nminutiae extractor provides a time and memory efficient solution to extract a\nglobal as well as a local representation of the fingerprint. The use of these\nrepresentations along with a smart matching process gives us state-of-the-art\nperformance across multiple databases.

    "abstract": "In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) combined with variants of\nrecurrent neural networks (RNNs) have reached state-of-the-art performance in\nspatiotemporal forecasting tasks. This is particularly the case for traffic\nforecasting, where GNN models use the graph structure of road networks to\naccount for spatial correlation between links and nodes. Recent solutions are\neither based on complex graph operations or avoiding predefined graphs. This\npaper proposes a new sequence-to-sequence architecture to extract the\nspatiotemporal correlation at multiple levels of abstraction using GNN-RNN\ncells with sparse architecture to decrease training time compared to more\ncomplex designs. Encoding the same input sequence through multiple encoders,\nwith an incremental increase in encoder layers, enables the network to learn\ngeneral and detailed information through multilevel abstraction. We further\npresent a new benchmark dataset of street-level segment traffic data from\nMontreal, Canada. Unlike highways, urban road segments are cyclic and\ncharacterized by complicated spatial dependencies. Experimental results on the\nMETR-LA benchmark highway and our MSLTD street-level segment datasets\ndemonstrate that our model improves performance by more than 7% for one-hour\nprediction compared to the baseline methods while reducing computing resource\nrequirements by more than half compared to other competing methods.",

While\nreinforcement learning has found resounding empirical success in many scenarios\nwith few agents, problems with many agents quickly become intractable and\nnecessitate special consideration. In this survey, we will shed light on\ncurrent approaches to tractably understanding and analyzing large-population\nsystems, both through multi-agent reinforcement learning and through adjacent\nareas of research such as mean-field games, collective intelligence, or complex\nnetwork theory. These classically independent subject areas offer a variety of\napproaches to understanding or modeling large-population systems, which may be\nof great use for the formulation of tractable MARL algorithms in the future.\nFinally, we survey potential areas of application for large-scale control and\nidentify fruitful future applications of learning algorithms in practical\nsystems.

    "abstract": "Psychomotor retardation in depression has been associated with speech timing\nchanges from dyadic clinical interviews. In this work, we investigate speech\ntiming features from free-living dyadic interactions. Apart from the\npossibility of continuous monitoring to complement clinical visits, a study in\nfree-living conditions would also allow inferring sociability features such as\ndyadic interaction frequency implicated in depression. We adapted a speaker\ncount estimator as a dyadic interaction detector with a specificity of 89.5%\nand a sensitivity of 86.1% in the DIHARD dataset. Using the detector, we\nobtained speech timing features from the detected dyadic interactions in\nmulti-day audio recordings of 32 participants comprised of 13 healthy\nindividuals, 11 individuals with depression, and 8 individuals with psychotic\ndisorders. The dyadic interaction frequency increased with depression severity\nin participants with no or mild depression, indicating a potential diagnostic\nmarker of depression onset. However, the dyadic interaction frequency decreased\nwith increasing depression severity for participants with moderate or severe\ndepression. In terms of speech timing features, the response time had a\nsignificant positive correlation with depression severity. Our work shows the\npotential of dyadic interaction analysis from audio recordings of free-living\nto obtain markers of depression severity.",

    "abstract": "Graph neural network (GNN) based methods have saturated the field of\nrecommender systems. The gains of these systems have been significant, showing\nthe advantages of interpreting data through a network structure. However,\ndespite the noticeable benefits of using graph structures in recommendation\ntasks, this representational form has also bred new challenges which exacerbate\nthe complexity of mitigating algorithmic bias. When GNNs are integrated into\ndownstream tasks, such as recommendation, bias mitigation can become even more\ndifficult. Furthermore, the intractability of applying existing methods of\nfairness promotion to large, real world datasets places even more serious\nconstraints on mitigation attempts. Our work sets out to fill in this gap by\ntaking an existing method for promoting individual fairness on graphs and\nextending it to support mini-batch, or sub-sample based, training of a GNN,\nthus laying the groundwork for applying this method to a downstream\nrecommendation task. We evaluate two popular GNN methods: Graph Convolutional\nNetwork (GCN), which trains on the entire graph, and GraphSAGE, which uses\nprobabilistic random walks to create subgraphs for mini-batch training, and\nassess the effects of sub-sampling on individual fairness. We implement an\nindividual fairness notion called \\textit{REDRESS}, proposed by Dong et al.,\nwhich uses rank optimization to learn individual fair node, or item,\nembeddings. We empirically show on two real world datasets that GraphSAGE is\nable to achieve, not just, comparable accuracy, but also, improved fairness as\ncompared with the GCN model. These finding have consequential ramifications to\nindividual fairness promotion, GNNs, and in downstream form, recommender\nsystems, showing that mini-batch training facilitate individual fairness\npromotion by allowing for local nuance to guide the process of fairness\npromotion in representation learning.",

    "abstract": "Differential privacy is a widely accepted formal privacy definition that\nallows aggregate information about a dataset to be released while controlling\nprivacy leakage for individuals whose records appear in the data. Due to the\nunavoidable tension between privacy and utility, there have been many works\ntrying to relax the requirements of differential privacy to achieve greater\nutility. One class of relaxation, which is starting to gain support outside the\nprivacy community is embodied by the definitions of individual differential\nprivacy (IDP) and bootstrap differential privacy (BDP). The original version of\ndifferential privacy defines a set of neighboring database pairs and achieves\nits privacy guarantees by requiring that each pair of neighbors should be\nnearly indistinguishable to an attacker. The privacy definitions we study,\nhowever, aggressively reduce the set of neighboring pairs that are protected.\nBoth IDP and BDP define a measure of \"privacy loss\" that satisfies formal\nprivacy properties such as postprocessing invariance and composition, and\nachieve dramatically better utility than the traditional variants of\ndifferential privacy. However, there is a significant downside - we show that\nthey allow a significant portion of the dataset to be reconstructed using\nalgorithms that have arbitrarily low privacy loss under their privacy\naccounting rules. We demonstrate these attacks using the preferred mechanisms\nof these privacy definitions. In particular, we design a set of queries that,\nwhen protected by these mechanisms with high noise settings (i.e., with claims\nof very low privacy loss), yield more precise information about the dataset\nthan if they were not protected at all.",

These models randomly mask a\nportion of the input and reconstruct the masked portion according to the target\nrepresentations. In this paper, we first show that a careful choice of the\ntarget representation is unnecessary for learning good representations, since\ndifferent targets tend to derive similarly behaved models. Driven by this\nobservation, we propose a multi-stage masked distillation pipeline and use a\nrandomly initialized model as the teacher, enabling us to effectively train\nhigh-capacity models without any efforts to carefully design target\nrepresentations. Interestingly, we further explore using teachers of larger\ncapacity, obtaining distilled students with remarkable transferring ability. On\ndifferent tasks of classification, transfer learning, object detection, and\nsemantic segmentation, the proposed method to perform masked knowledge\ndistillation with bootstrapped teachers (dBOT) outperforms previous\nself-supervised methods by nontrivial margins.

    "abstract": "We study a repeated information design problem faced by an informed sender\nwho tries to influence the behavior of a self-interested receiver. We consider\nsettings where the receiver faces a sequential decision making (SDM) problem.\nAt each round, the sender observes the realizations of random events in the SDM\nproblem. This begets the challenge of how to incrementally disclose such\ninformation to the receiver to persuade them to follow (desirable) action\nrecommendations. We study the case in which the sender does not know random\nevents probabilities, and, thus, they have to gradually learn them while\npersuading the receiver. We start by providing a non-trivial polytopal\napproximation of the set of sender's persuasive information structures. This is\ncrucial to design efficient learning algorithms. Next, we prove a negative\nresult: no learning algorithm can be persuasive. Thus, we relax persuasiveness\nrequirements by focusing on algorithms that guarantee that the receiver's\nregret in following recommendations grows sub-linearly. In the full-feedback\nsetting -- where the sender observes all random events realizations -- , we\nprovide an algorithm with $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret for both the sender and\nthe receiver. Instead, in the bandit-feedback setting -- where the sender only\nobserves the realizations of random events actually occurring in the SDM\nproblem -- , we design an algorithm that, given an $\\alpha \\in [1/2, 1]$ as\ninput, ensures $\\tilde{O}({T^\\alpha})$ and $\\tilde{O}( T^{\\max \\{ \\alpha,\n1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\} })$ regrets, for the sender and the receiver\nrespectively. This result is complemented by a lower bound showing that such a\nregrets trade-off is essentially tight.",

Given the rapid growth of these\nnovel uses, there is a pressing need to investigate how ML techniques support\nlong-standing education principles and goals. In this work, we shed light on\nthis complex landscape drawing on qualitative insights from interviews with\neducation experts. These interviews comprise in-depth evaluations of ML for\neducation (ML4Ed) papers published in preeminent applied ML conferences over\nthe past decade. Our central research goal is to critically examine how the\nstated or implied education and societal objectives of these papers are aligned\nwith the ML problems they tackle. That is, to what extent does the technical\nproblem formulation, objectives, approach, and interpretation of results align\nwith the education problem at hand. We find that a cross-disciplinary gap\nexists and is particularly salient in two parts of the ML life cycle: the\nformulation of an ML problem from education goals and the translation of\npredictions to interventions. We use these insights to propose an extended ML\nlife cycle, which may also apply to the use of ML in other domains. Our work\njoins a growing number of meta-analytical studies across education and ML\nresearch, as well as critical analyses of the societal impact of ML.\nSpecifically, it fills a gap between the prevailing technical understanding of\nmachine learning and the perspective of education researchers working with\nstudents and in policy.",

Despite this recent interest, the utility of xAI\ntechniques has not yet been characterized in human-machine teaming.\nImportantly, xAI offers the promise of enhancing team situational awareness\n(SA) and shared mental model development, which are the key characteristics of\neffective human-machine teams. Rapidly developing such mental models is\nespecially critical in ad hoc human-machine teaming, where agents do not have a\npriori knowledge of others' decision-making strategies. In this paper, we\npresent two novel human-subject experiments quantifying the benefits of\ndeploying xAI techniques within a human-machine teaming scenario. First, we\nshow that xAI techniques can support SA ($p<0.05)$. Second, we examine how\ndifferent SA levels induced via a collaborative AI policy abstraction affect ad\nhoc human-machine teaming performance. Importantly, we find that the benefits\nof xAI are not universal, as there is a strong dependence on the composition of\nthe human-machine team. Novices benefit from xAI providing increased SA\n($p<0.05$) but are susceptible to cognitive overhead ($p<0.05$). On the other\nhand, expert performance degrades with the addition of xAI-based support\n($p<0.05$), indicating that the cost of paying attention to the xAI outweighs\nthe benefits obtained from being provided additional information to enhance SA.\nOur results demonstrate that researchers must deliberately design and deploy\nthe right xAI techniques in the right scenario by carefully considering\nhuman-machine team composition and how the xAI method augments SA.",

A rating system is a procedure by which player\nratings are adjusted upwards each time they win, or downwards each time they\nlose.\nMany matchmaking systems give players some control over their opponent's\nrating; for example, a player might be able to selectively initiate matches\nagainst opponents whose ratings are publicly visible, or abort a match without\npenalty before it begins but after glimpsing their opponent's rating. It is\nnatural to ask whether one can design a rating system that does not incentivize\na rating-maximizing player to act strategically, seeking matches against\nopponents of one rating over another.

    "abstract": "We propose TF-GridNet, a novel multi-path deep neural network (DNN) operating\nin the time-frequency (T-F) domain, for monaural talker-independent speaker\nseparation in anechoic conditions. The model stacks several multi-path blocks,\neach consisting of an intra-frame spectral module, a sub-band temporal module,\nand a full-band self-attention module, to leverage local and global\nspectro-temporal information for separation. The model is trained to perform\ncomplex spectral mapping, where the real and imaginary (RI) components of the\ninput mixture are stacked as input features to predict the target RI\ncomponents. Besides using the scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio\n(SI-SDR) loss for model training, we include a novel loss term to encourage the\nseparated sources to add up to the input mixture. Without using dynamic mixing,\nwe obtain 23.4 dB SI-SDR improvement (SI-SDRi) on the WSJ0-2mix dataset,\noutperforming the previous best by a large margin.",

    "abstract": "The application of the context-adaptive entropy model significantly improves\nthe rate-distortion (R-D) performance, in which hyperpriors and autoregressive\nmodels are jointly utilized to effectively capture the spatial redundancy of\nthe latent representations. However, the latent representations still contain\nsome spatial correlations. In addition, these methods based on the\ncontext-adaptive entropy model cannot be accelerated in the decoding process by\nparallel computing devices, e.g. FPGA or GPU. To alleviate these limitations,\nwe propose a learned multi-resolution image compression framework, which\nexploits the recently developed octave convolutions to factorize the latent\nrepresentations into the high-resolution (HR) and low-resolution (LR) parts,\nsimilar to wavelet transform, which further improves the R-D performance. To\nspeed up the decoding, our scheme does not use context-adaptive entropy model.\nInstead, we exploit an additional hyper layer including hyper encoder and hyper\ndecoder to further remove the spatial redundancy of the latent representation.\nMoreover, the cross-resolution parameter estimation (CRPE) is introduced into\nthe proposed framework to enhance the flow of information and further improve\nthe rate-distortion performance. An additional information-fidelity loss is\nproposed to the total loss function to adjust the contribution of the LR part\nto the final bit stream. Experimental results show that our method separately\nreduces the decoding time by approximately 73.35 % and 93.44 % compared with\nthat of state-of-the-art learned image compression methods, and the R-D\nperformance is still better than H.266/VVC(4:2:0) and some learning-based\nmethods on both PSNR and MS-SSIM metrics across a wide bit rates.",

In this study, we propose a deep learning-based system that\nautomatically detects 14 keypoints from a radiograph, measures three anatomical\nangles (center-edge, T\\\"onnis, and Sharp angles), and classifies DDH hips as\ngrades I-IV based on the Crowe criteria.

In addition,\nuncertainty analysis of IFWI can be easily performed by approximating Bayesian\ninference with various deep learning approaches, which is analyzed in this\npaper by adding dropout neurons.

    "abstract": "The training of deep neural networks and other modern machine learning models\nusually consists in solving non-convex optimisation problems that are\nhigh-dimensional and subject to large-scale data. Here, momentum-based\nstochastic optimisation algorithms have become especially popular in recent\nyears. The stochasticity arises from data subsampling which reduces\ncomputational cost. Moreover, both, momentum and stochasticity are supposed to\nhelp the algorithm to overcome local minimisers and, hopefully, converge\nglobally. Theoretically, this combination of stochasticity and momentum is\nbadly understood.\nIn this work, we propose and analyse a continuous-time model for stochastic\ngradient descent with momentum. This model is a piecewise-deterministic Markov\nprocess that represents the particle movement by an underdamped dynamical\nsystem and the data subsampling through a stochastic switching of the dynamical\nsystem. In our analysis, we investigate longtime limits, the\nsubsampling-to-no-subsampling limit, and the momentum-to-no-momentum limit. We\nare particularly interested in the case of reducing the momentum over time:\nintuitively, the momentum helps to overcome local minimisers in the initial\nphase of the algorithm, but prohibits fast convergence to a global minimiser\nlater. Under convexity assumptions, we show convergence of our dynamical system\nto the global minimiser when reducing momentum over time and let the\nsubsampling rate go to infinity.\nWe then propose a stable, symplectic discretisation scheme to construct an\nalgorithm from our continuous-time dynamical system. In numerical experiments,\nwe study our discretisation scheme in convex and non-convex test problems.\nAdditionally, we train a convolutional neural network to solve the CIFAR-10\nimage classification problem. Here, our algorithm reaches competitive results\ncompared to stochastic gradient descent with momentum.",

Further, we experimentally validate that the sensor\ncan classify texture with roughness depths as low as $2.5\\mu m$ at an accuracy\nof $90\\%$ or more and segregate materials based on their roughness and\nhardness. We present a novel metric to consider while designing a whisker\nsensor to guarantee the quality of texture data acquisition beforehand.

    "title": "Ballot-Polling Audits of Instant-Runoff Voting Elections with a  Dirichlet-Tree Model",
    "abstract": "Instant-runoff voting (IRV) is used in several countries around the world. It\nrequires voters to rank candidates in order of preference, and uses a counting\nalgorithm that is more complex than systems such as first-past-the-post or\nscoring rules. An even more complex system, the single transferable vote (STV),\nis used when multiple candidates need to be elected. The complexity of these\nsystems has made it difficult to audit the election outcomes. There is\ncurrently no known risk-limiting audit (RLA) method for STV, other than a full\nmanual count of the ballots.\nA new approach to auditing these systems was recently proposed, based on a\nDirichlet-tree model. We present a detailed analysis of this approach for\nballot-polling Bayesian audits of IRV elections. We compared several choices\nfor the prior distribution, including some approaches using a Bayesian\nbootstrap (equivalent to an improper prior). Our findings include that the\nbootstrap-based approaches can be adapted to perform similarly to a full\nBayesian model in practice, and that an overly informative prior can give\ncounter-intuitive results. Via carefully chosen examples, we show why creating\nan RLA with this model is challenging, but we also suggest ways to overcome\nthis.\nAs well as providing a practical and computationally feasible implementation\nof a Bayesian IRV audit, our work is important in laying the foundation for an\nRLA for STV elections.",

We solve the segmentation problem of the pulmonary artery\nby using a two-stage method based on a 3D CNN network. The coarse model is used\nto locate the ROI, and the fine model is used to refine the segmentation\nresult. In addition, in order to improve the segmentation performance, we adopt\nmulti-view and multi-window level method, at the same time we employ a\nfine-tune strategy to mitigate the impact of inconsistent labeling.",

    "title": "Multiobjective Ranking and Selection Using Stochastic Kriging",
    "abstract": "We consider multiobjective simulation optimization problems, where several\nconflicting objectives are optimized simultaneously, and can only be observed\nvia stochastic simulation. The goal is to find or approximate a (discrete) set\nof Pareto-optimal solutions that reveal the essential trade-offs between the\nobjectives, where optimality means that no objective can be improved without\ndeteriorating the quality of any other objective. The noise in the observed\nperformance may lead to two possible misclassification errors: solutions that\nare truly Pareto-optimal can be wrongly considered dominated, and solutions\nthat are truly dominated can be wrongly considered Pareto-optimal. We propose a\nBayesian multiobjective ranking and selection method to reduce the number of\nerrors when identifying the solutions with the true best expected performance.\nWe use stochastic kriging metamodels to build reliable predictive distributions\nof the objectives, and exploit this information in two efficient screening\nprocedures and two novel sampling criteria. We use these in a sequential\nsampling algorithm to decide how to allocate samples. Experimental results show\nthat the proposed method only requires a small fraction of samples compared to\nthe standard allocation method, and it's competitive against the\nstate-of-the-art, with the exploitation of the correlation structure being the\ndominant contributor to the improvement.",
