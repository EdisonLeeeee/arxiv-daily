    "title": "Multi-channel Nuclear Norm Minus Frobenius Norm Minimization for Color  Image Denoising",
    "abstract": "Color image denoising is frequently encountered in various image processing\nand computer vision tasks. One traditional strategy is to convert the RGB image\nto a less correlated color space and denoise each channel of the new space\nseparately. However, such a strategy can not fully exploit the correlated\ninformation between channels and is inadequate to obtain satisfactory results.\nTo address this issue, this paper proposes a new multi-channel optimization\nmodel for color image denoising under the nuclear norm minus Frobenius norm\nminimization framework. Specifically, based on the block-matching, the color\nimage is decomposed into overlapping RGB patches. For each patch, we stack its\nsimilar neighbors to form the corresponding patch matrix. The proposed model is\nperformed on the patch matrix to recover its noise-free version. During the\nrecovery process, a) a weight matrix is introduced to fully utilize the noise\ndifference between channels; b) the singular values are shrunk adaptively\nwithout additionally assigning weights. With them, the proposed model can\nachieve promising results while keeping simplicity. To solve the proposed\nmodel, an accurate and effective algorithm is built based on the alternating\ndirection method of multipliers framework. The solution of each updating step\ncan be analytically expressed in closed-from. Rigorous theoretical analysis\nproves the solution sequences generated by the proposed algorithm converge to\ntheir respective stationary points. Experimental results on both synthetic and\nreal noise datasets demonstrate the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art\nmodels.",

    "abstract": "Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging from different camera devices\ncauses challenging domain shifts and can cause a severe drop in accuracy for\nmachine learning models. In this work, we introduce a minimal noise adaptation\nmethod based on a singular value decomposition (SVDNA) to overcome the domain\ngap between target domains from three different device manufacturers in retinal\nOCT imaging. Our method utilizes the difference in noise structure to\nsuccessfully bridge the domain gap between different OCT devices and transfer\nthe style from unlabeled target domain images to source images for which manual\nannotations are available. We demonstrate how this method, despite its\nsimplicity, compares or even outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised domain\nadaptation methods for semantic segmentation on a public OCT dataset. SVDNA can\nbe integrated with just a few lines of code into the augmentation pipeline of\nany network which is in contrast to many state-of-the-art domain adaptation\nmethods which often need to change the underlying model architecture or train a\nseparate style transfer model.

    "title": "Detecting Political Biases of Named Entities and Hashtags on Twitter",
    "abstract": "Ideological divisions in the United States have become increasingly prominent\nin daily communication. Accordingly, there has been much research on political\npolarization, including many recent efforts that take a computational\nperspective. By detecting political biases in a corpus of text, one can attempt\nto describe and discern the polarity of that text. Intuitively, the named\nentities (i.e., the nouns and phrases that act as nouns) and hashtags in text\noften carry information about political views. For example, people who use the\nterm \"pro-choice\" are likely to be liberal, whereas people who use the term\n\"pro-life\" are likely to be conservative. In this paper, we seek to reveal\npolitical polarities in social-media text data and to quantify these polarities\nby explicitly assigning a polarity score to entities and hashtags. Although\nthis idea is straightforward, it is difficult to perform such inference in a\ntrustworthy quantitative way. Key challenges include the small number of known\nlabels, the continuous spectrum of political views, and the preservation of\nboth a polarity score and a polarity-neutral semantic meaning in an embedding\nvector of words. To attempt to overcome these challenges, we propose the\nPolarity-aware Embedding Multi-task learning (PEM) model. This model consists\nof (1) a self-supervised context-preservation task, (2) an attention-based\ntweet-level polarity-inference task, and (3) an adversarial learning task that\npromotes independence between an embedding's polarity dimension and its\nsemantic dimensions. Our experimental results demonstrate that our PEM model\ncan successfully learn polarity-aware embeddings. We examine a variety of\napplications and we thereby demonstrate the effectiveness of our PEM model. We\nalso discuss important limitations of our work and stress caution when applying\nthe PEM model to real-world scenarios.",

    "abstract": "The $h$-index is a metric used to measure the impact of a user in a\npublication setting, such as a member of a social network with many highly\nliked posts or a researcher in an academic domain with many highly cited\npublications. Specifically, the $h$-index of a user is the largest integer $h$\nsuch that at least $h$ publications of the user have at least $h$ units of\npositive feedback.\nWe design an algorithm that, given query access to the $n$ publications of a\nuser and each publication's corresponding positive feedback number, outputs a\n$(1\\pm \\varepsilon)$-approximation of the $h$-index of this user with\nprobability at least $1-\\delta$ in time \\[\nO(\\frac{n \\cdot \\ln{(1/\\delta)}}{\\varepsilon^2 \\cdot h}),\n\\] where $h$ is the actual $h$-index which is unknown to the algorithm\na-priori. We then design a novel lower bound technique that allows us to prove\nthat this bound is in fact asymptotically optimal for this problem in all\nparameters $n,h,\\varepsilon,$ and $\\delta$.\nOur work is one of the first in sublinear time algorithms that addresses\nobtaining asymptotically optimal bounds, especially in terms of the error and\nconfidence parameters. As such, we focus on designing novel techniques for this\ntask. In particular, our lower bound technique seems quite general -- to\nshowcase this, we also use our approach to prove an asymptotically optimal\nlower bound for the problem of estimating the number of triangles in a graph in\nsublinear time, which now is also optimal in the error and confidence\nparameters.

    "abstract": "This paper studies the consequences of a human-initiated targeted attack on\nthe national electric power system. We consider two kinds of attacks: ($i$) an\nattack by an adversary that uses a tactical weapon and destroys a large part of\nthe grid, by physically targeting a large geographic region; ($ii$) a targeted\nattack by an adversary that takes out a small number of critical components in\nthe network simultaneously. Our analysis uses ($i$) a realistic representation\nof the underlying power grid, including the topology, the control and\nprotection components, ($ii$) a realistic representation of the targeted attack\nscenario, and ($iii$) a dynamic stability analysis, that goes beyond\ntraditional work comprising structural and linear flow analysis. Such realistic\nanalysis is expensive, but critical since it can capture cascading failures\nthat result from transient instabilities introduced due to the attack. Our\nmodel acknowledges the presence of hidden failures in the protection systems\nresulting in relay misoperations. We analyze the extent of cascading outages\nfor different levels of hidden failures. Our results show that: ($i$) the power\ngrid is vulnerable to both these attacks, ($ii$) the tactical attack has\nsignificant social, economic and health damage but need not result in a\nregional cascade; on the contrary the targeted attack can cause significant\ncascade and lead to power outage over a large region. Our work shows the\nnecessity to harden the power grid not just to cyber-attacks but also to\nphysical attacks. Furthermore, we show that realistic representations and\nanalysis can lead to fundamentally new insights that simplified models are\nunlikely to capture. Finally, the methods and results help us identify critical\nelements in the grid; the system can then be hardened in a more precise manner\nto reduce the vulnerabilities.",

    "abstract": "3D tooth segmentation is an important task for digital orthodontics. Several\nDeep Learning methods have been proposed for automatic tooth segmentation from\n3D dental models or intraoral scans. These methods require annotated 3D\nintraoral scans. Manually annotating 3D intraoral scans is a laborious task.\nOne approach is to devise self-supervision methods to reduce the manual\nlabeling effort. Compared to other types of point cloud data like scene point\ncloud or shape point cloud data, 3D tooth point cloud data has a very regular\nstructure and a strong shape prior. We look at how much representative\ninformation can be learnt from a single 3D intraoral scan. We evaluate this\nquantitatively with the help of ten different methods of which six are generic\npoint cloud segmentation methods whereas the other four are tooth segmentation\nspecific methods. Surprisingly, we find that with a single 3D intraoral scan\ntraining, the Dice score can be as high as 0.86 whereas the full training set\ngives Dice score of 0.94. We conclude that the segmentation methods can learn a\ngreat deal of information from a single 3D tooth point cloud scan under\nsuitable conditions e.g. data augmentation. We are the first to quantitatively\nevaluate and demonstrate the representation learning capability of Deep\nLearning methods from a single 3D intraoral scan.

In sharp contrast to\nthe well-studied scalar subdivision schemes, vector subdivision schemes are\nmuch less well understood, e.g., Lagrange and (generalized) Hermite subdivision\nschemes are the only studied vector subdivision schemes in the literature.\nBecause many wavelets used in numerical PDEs are derived from refinable vector\nfunctions whose matrix masks are not from Hermite subdivision schemes, it is\nnecessary to introduce and study vector subdivision schemes for any general\nmatrix masks in order to compute wavelets and refinable vector functions\nefficiently.

We propose a novel re-ranking approach that leverages\nvisual-semantic measures to identify the ideal caption that maximally captures\nthe visual information in the image. Our re-ranker utilizes the Belief Revision\nframework (Blok et al., 2003) to calibrate the original likelihood of the top-n\ncaptions by explicitly exploiting the semantic relatedness between the depicted\ncaption and the visual context. Our experiments demonstrate the utility of our\napproach, where we observe that our re-ranker can enhance the performance of a\ntypical image-captioning system without the necessity of any additional\ntraining or fine-tuning.",

    "abstract": "Code comments are important artifacts in software systems and play a\nparamount role in many software engineering (SE) tasks related to maintenance\nand program comprehension. However, while it is widely accepted that high\nquality matters in code comments just as it matters in source code, assessing\ncomment quality in practice is still an open problem. First and foremost, there\nis no unique definition of quality when it comes to evaluating code comments.\nThe few existing studies on this topic rather focus on specific attributes of\nquality that can be easily quantified and measured. Existing techniques and\ncorresponding tools may also focus on comments bound to a specific programming\nlanguage, and may only deal with comments with specific scopes and clear goals\n(e.g., Javadoc comments at the method level, or in-body comments describing\nTODOs to be addressed). In this paper, we present a Systematic Literature\nReview (SLR) of the last decade of research in SE to answer the following\nresearch questions: (i) What types of comments do researchers focus on when\nassessing comment quality? (ii) What quality attributes (QAs) do they consider?\n(iii) Which tools and techniques do they use to assess comment quality?, and\n(iv) How do they evaluate their studies on comment quality assessment in\ngeneral? Our evaluation, based on the analysis of 2353 papers and the actual\nreview of 47 relevant ones, shows that (i) most studies and techniques focus on\ncomments in Java code, thus may not be generalizable to other languages, and\n(ii) the analyzed studies focus on four main QAs of a total of 21 QAs\nidentified in the literature, with a clear predominance of checking consistency\nbetween comments and the code. We observe that researchers rely on manual\nassessment and specific heuristics rather than the automated assessment of the\ncomment quality attributes.",

Let $n$ be the\nnumber of nodes of a spider and $d$ be the length of each leg, and suppose that\nwe are given independent traces of the spider from a deletion channel in which\neach non-root node is deleted with probability $q$. This is a natural\ngeneralization of the string trace reconstruction problem in theoretical\ncomputer science, which corresponds to the special case where the spider has\none leg. In the regime where $d\\ge \\log_{1/q}(n)$, the problem can be reduced\nto the vanilla string trace reconstruction problem.

A well-known strategy to design such devices\nis multi-scale topology optimization (MTO), where optimal microstructures are\ndesigned within each cell of a discretized domain. Unfortunately, MTO is\ncomputationally very expensive since one must perform homogenization of the\nevolving microstructures, during each step of the homogenization process. As an\nalternate, we propose here a graded multiscale topology optimization (GMTO) for\ndesigning fluid-flow devices. In the proposed method, several pre-selected but\nsize-parameterized and orientable microstructures are used to fill the domain\noptimally. GMTO significantly reduces the computation while retaining many of\nthe benefits of MTO.\nIn particular, GMTO is implemented here using a neural-network (NN) since:\n(1) homogenization can be performed off-line, and used by the NN during\noptimization, (2) it enables continuous switching between microstructures\nduring optimization, (3) the number of design variables and computational\neffort is independent of number of microstructure used, and, (4) it supports\nautomatic differentiation, thereby eliminating manual sensitivity analysis.\nSeveral numerical results are presented to illustrate the proposed framework.",

Training deep learning models\ncommonly requires large datasets with expert-labeled annotations. However,\nacquiring expert-labeled annotation is not only expensive but also is\nsubjective, error-prone, and inter-/intra- observer variability introduces\nnoise to labels. This is particularly a problem when using deep learning models\nfor segmenting medical images due to the ambiguous anatomical boundaries.\nImage-based medical diagnosis tools using deep learning models trained with\nincorrect segmentation labels can lead to false diagnoses and treatment\nsuggestions. Multi-rater annotations might be better suited to train deep\nlearning models with small training sets compared to single-rater annotations.\nThe aim of this paper was to develop and evaluate a method to generate\nprobabilistic labels based on multi-rater annotations and anatomical knowledge\nof the lesion features in MRI and a method to train segmentation models using\nprobabilistic labels using normalized active-passive loss as a \"noise-tolerant\nloss\" function. The model was evaluated by comparing it to binary ground truth\nfor 17 knees MRI scans for clinical segmentation and detection of bone marrow\nlesions (BML).

    "abstract": "Optimal scaling has been well studied for Metropolis-Hastings (M-H)\nalgorithms in continuous spaces, but a similar understanding has been lacking\nin discrete spaces. Recently, a family of locally balanced proposals (LBP) for\ndiscrete spaces has been proved to be asymptotically optimal, but the question\nof optimal scaling has remained open. In this paper, we establish, for the\nfirst time, that the efficiency of M-H in discrete spaces can also be\ncharacterized by an asymptotic acceptance rate that is independent of the\ntarget distribution. Moreover, we verify, both theoretically and empirically,\nthat the optimal acceptance rates for LBP and random walk Metropolis (RWM) are\n$0.574$ and $0.234$ respectively. These results also help establish that LBP is\nasymptotically $O(N^\\frac{2}{3})$ more efficient than RWM with respect to model\ndimension $N$. Knowledge of the optimal acceptance rate allows one to\nautomatically tune the neighborhood size of a proposal distribution in a\ndiscrete space, directly analogous to step-size control in continuous spaces.\nWe demonstrate empirically that such adaptive M-H sampling can robustly improve\nsampling in a variety of target distributions in discrete spaces, including\ntraining deep energy based models.",

In\nthis work, we consider the task of obtaining accurate state estimates for\nrobotic systems by enhancing the dynamics model used in state estimation\nalgorithms. Existing frameworks such as moving horizon estimation (MHE) and the\nunscented Kalman filter (UKF) provide the flexibility to incorporate nonlinear\ndynamics and measurement models. However, this implies that the dynamics model\nwithin these algorithms has to be sufficiently accurate in order to warrant the\naccuracy of the state estimates. To enhance the dynamics models and improve the\nestimation accuracy, we utilize a deep learning framework known as\nknowledge-based neural ordinary differential equations (KNODEs). The KNODE\nframework embeds prior knowledge into the training procedure and synthesizes an\naccurate hybrid model by fusing a prior first-principles model with a neural\nordinary differential equation (NODE) model. In our proposed LEARNEST\nframework, we integrate the data-driven model into two novel model-based state\nestimation algorithms, which are denoted as KNODE-MHE and KNODE-UKF. These two\nalgorithms are compared against their conventional counterparts across a number\nof robotic applications; state estimation for a cartpole system using partial\nmeasurements, localization for a ground robot, as well as state estimation for\na quadrotor.

Key advantages\nof VSH-based magnetic random-access memory (VSH-MRAM) over spin orbit torque\n(SOT)-MRAM include access transistor-less compact bit-cell and low power\nswitching of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) magnets. Nevertheless,\nlarge device resistance in the read path (RS) due to low mobility of WSe2 and\nSchottky contacts deteriorates sense margin, offsetting the benefits of\nVSH-MRAM. To address this limitation, we propose another flavor of VSH-based\nMRAM that (while inheriting most of the benefits of VSH-MRAM) achieves lower RS\nin the read path by electrically isolating the read and write terminals. This\nis enabled by coupling VSH with electrically-isolated but magnetically-coupled\nPMA magnets via interlayer exchange-coupling. Designing the proposed devices\nusing object oriented micro magnetic framework (OOMMF) simulation, we ensure\nthe robustness of the exchange-coupled PMA system under process variations.

    "abstract": "We address the problem of online sequential decision making, i.e., balancing\nthe trade-off between exploiting the current knowledge to maximize immediate\nperformance and exploring the new information to gain long-term benefits using\nthe multi-armed bandit framework. Thompson sampling is one of the heuristics\nfor choosing actions that address this exploration-exploitation dilemma. We\nfirst propose a general framework that helps heuristically tune the exploration\nversus exploitation trade-off in Thompson sampling using multiple samples from\nthe posterior distribution. Utilizing this framework, we propose two algorithms\nfor the multi-armed bandit problem and provide theoretical bounds on the\ncumulative regret. Next, we demonstrate the empirical improvement in the\ncumulative regret performance of the proposed algorithm over Thompson Sampling.\nWe also show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on real-world\ndatasets. Contrary to the existing methods, our framework provides a mechanism\nto vary the amount of exploration/ exploitation based on the task at hand.\nTowards this end, we extend our framework for two additional problems, i.e.,\nbest arm identification and time-sensitive learning in bandits and compare our\nalgorithm with existing methods.",

An ideal beam alignment technique should achieve high\nbeamforming (BF) gain with low latency, scale well to systems with higher\ncarrier frequencies, larger antenna arrays and multiple user equipments (UEs),\nand not require hard-to-obtain context information (CI). These qualities are\ncollectively lacking in existing methods.

In realistic settings,\nthe proposed method achieves a far superior signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-latency\ntrade-off compared to the CB baselines: it aligns near-optimal beams 100x\nfaster or equivalently finds beams with 10-15 dB better average SNR in the same\nnumber of searches, relative to an exhaustive search over a conventional\ncodebook.",

    "abstract": "Natural language modeling with limited training data is a challenging\nproblem, and many algorithms make use of large-scale pretrained language models\n(PLMs) for this due to its great generalization ability. Among them, additive\nlearning that incorporates a task-specific adapter on top of the fixed\nlarge-scale PLM has been popularly used in the few-shot setting. However, this\nadded adapter is still easy to disregard the knowledge of the PLM especially\nfor few-shot natural language generation (NLG) since an entire sequence is\nusually generated by only the newly trained adapter. Therefore, in this work,\nwe develop a novel additive learning algorithm based on reinforcement learning\n(RL) that selectively outputs language tokens between the task-general PLM and\nthe task-specific adapter during both training and inference. This output token\nselection over the two generators allows the adapter to take into account\nsolely the task-relevant parts in sequence generation, and therefore makes it\nmore robust to overfitting as well as more stable in RL training. In addition,\nto obtain the complementary adapter from the PLM for each few-shot task, we\nexploit a separate selecting module that is also simultaneously trained using\nRL. Experimental results on various few-shot NLG tasks including question\nanswering, data-to-text generation and text summarization demonstrate that the\nproposed selective token generation significantly outperforms the previous\nadditive learning algorithms based on the PLMs.",

However, there are no sizable\ndatasets that contain offensive texts and their inoffensive counterparts, and\nfine-tuning pretrained models with limited labeled data can lead to the loss of\noriginal meaning in the style-transferred text. To address this issue, we\nprovide two major contributions.

Then, we\nintroduce the first discourse-aware style-transfer models that can effectively\nreduce offensiveness in Reddit text while preserving the meaning of the\noriginal text. These models are the first to examine inferential links between\nthe comment and the text it is replying to when transferring the style of\noffensive Reddit text. We propose two different methods of integrating\ndiscourse relations with pretrained transformer models and evaluate them on our\ndataset of offensive comments from Reddit and their inoffensive counterparts.\nImprovements over the baseline with respect to both automatic metrics and human\nevaluation indicate that our discourse-aware models are better at preserving\nmeaning in style-transferred text when compared to the state-of-the-art\ndiscourse-agnostic models.",

    "abstract": "Image inpainting has achieved remarkable progress and inspired abundant\nmethods, where the critical bottleneck is identified as how to fulfill the\nhigh-frequency structure and low-frequency texture information on the masked\nregions with semantics. To this end, deep models exhibit powerful superiority\nto capture them, yet constrained on the local spatial regions. In this paper,\nwe delve globally into texture and structure information to well capture the\nsemantics for image inpainting. As opposed to the existing arts trapped on the\nindependent local patches, the texture information of each patch is\nreconstructed from all other patches across the whole image, to match the\ncoarsely filled information, specially the structure information over the\nmasked regions. Unlike the current decoder-only transformer within the pixel\nlevel for image inpainting, our model adopts the transformer pipeline paired\nwith both encoder and decoder. On one hand, the encoder captures the texture\nsemantic correlations of all patches across image via self-attention module. On\nthe other hand, an adaptive patch vocabulary is dynamically established in the\ndecoder for the filled patches over the masked regions. Building on this, a\nstructure-texture matching attention module anchored on the known regions comes\nup to marry the best of these two worlds for progressive inpainting via a\nprobabilistic diffusion process. Our model is orthogonal to the fashionable\narts, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Attention and Transformer\nmodel, from the perspective of texture and structure information for image\ninpainting. The extensive experiments over the benchmarks validate its\nsuperiority. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/htyjers/DGTS-Inpainting.",

Since there\nusually exists a mismatch between the training and test (true) environments,\nincorporating model uncertainty into system design is of critical importance in\nreal-world applications. However, model uncertainties have not been considered\nexplicitly in EV AMoD system rebalancing by existing literature yet and remain\nan urgent and challenging task. In this work, we design a robust and\nconstrained multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework with transition\nkernel uncertainty for the EV rebalancing and charging problem. We then propose\na robust and constrained MARL algorithm (ROCOMA) that trains a robust EV\nrebalancing policy to balance the supply-demand ratio and the charging\nutilization rate across the whole city under state transition uncertainty.\nExperiments show that the ROCOMA can learn an effective and robust rebalancing\npolicy. It outperforms non-robust MARL methods when there are model\nuncertainties. It increases the system fairness by 19.6% and decreases the\nrebalancing costs by 75.8%.",

    "title": "Learning Distinct and Representative Modes for Image Captioning",
    "abstract": "Over the years, state-of-the-art (SoTA) image captioning methods have\nachieved promising results on some evaluation metrics (e.g., CIDEr). However,\nrecent findings show that the captions generated by these methods tend to be\nbiased toward the \"average\" caption that only captures the most general mode\n(a.k.a, language pattern) in the training corpus, i.e., the so-called mode\ncollapse problem. Affected by it, the generated captions are limited in\ndiversity and usually less informative than natural image descriptions made by\nhumans. In this paper, we seek to avoid this problem by proposing a Discrete\nMode Learning (DML) paradigm for image captioning. Our innovative idea is to\nexplore the rich modes in the training caption corpus to learn a set of \"mode\nembeddings\", and further use them to control the mode of the generated captions\nfor existing image captioning models. Specifically, the proposed DML optimizes\na dual architecture that consists of an image-conditioned discrete variational\nautoencoder (CdVAE) branch and a mode-conditioned image captioning (MIC)\nbranch. The CdVAE branch maps each image caption to one of the mode embeddings\nstored in a learned codebook, and is trained with a pure non-autoregressive\ngeneration objective to make the modes distinct and representative. The MIC\nbranch can be simply modified from an existing image captioning model, where\nthe mode embedding is added to the original word embeddings as the control\nsignal. In the experiments, we apply the proposed DML to two widely used image\ncaptioning models, Transformer and AoANet. The results show that the learned\nmode embedding successfully facilitates these models to generate high-quality\nimage captions with different modes, further leading to better performance for\nboth diversity and quality on the MSCOCO dataset.",

    "title": "Understanding the Impact of Image Quality and Distance of Objects to  Object Detection Performance",
    "abstract": "Deep learning has made great strides for object detection in images. The\ndetection accuracy and computational cost of object detection depend on the\nspatial resolution of an image, which may be constrained by both the camera and\nstorage considerations. Compression is often achieved by reducing either\nspatial or amplitude resolution or, at times, both, both of which have\nwell-known effects on performance. Detection accuracy also depends on the\ndistance of the object of interest from the camera. Our work examines the\nimpact of spatial and amplitude resolution, as well as object distance, on\nobject detection accuracy and computational cost. We develop a\nresolution-adaptive variant of YOLOv5 (RA-YOLO), which varies the number of\nscales in the feature pyramid and detection head based on the spatial\nresolution of the input image. To train and evaluate this new method, we\ncreated a dataset of images with diverse spatial and amplitude resolutions by\ncombining images from the TJU and Eurocity datasets and generating different\nresolutions by applying spatial resizing and compression. We first show that\nRA-YOLO achieves a good trade-off between detection accuracy and inference time\nover a large range of spatial resolutions. We then evaluate the impact of\nspatial and amplitude resolutions on object detection accuracy using the\nproposed RA-YOLO model. We demonstrate that the optimal spatial resolution that\nleads to the highest detection accuracy depends on the 'tolerated' image size.\nWe further assess the impact of the distance of an object to the camera on the\ndetection accuracy and show that higher spatial resolution enables a greater\ndetection range. These results provide important guidelines for choosing the\nimage spatial resolution and compression settings predicated on available\nbandwidth, storage, desired inference time, and/or desired detection range, in\npractical applications.",

For integration with motion\nplanning, it is desirable for SLAM pipelines to generate lightweight geometric\nmap representations. Such representations are also particularly well-suited for\nman-made environments, which can often be viewed as a so-called \"Manhattan\nworld\" built on a Cartesian grid. In this work we present a 3D LiDAR SLAM\nalgorithm for Manhattan world environments which extracts planar features from\npoint clouds to achieve lightweight, real-time localization and mapping. Our\napproach generates plane-based maps which occupy significantly less memory than\ntheir point cloud equivalents, and are suited towards fast collision checking\nfor motion planning. By leveraging the Manhattan world assumption, we target\nextraction of orthogonal planes to generate maps which are more structured and\norganized than those of existing plane-based LiDAR SLAM approaches. We\ndemonstrate our approach in the high-fidelity AirSim simulator and in\nreal-world experiments with a ground rover equipped with a Velodyne LiDAR.

In this paper, a novel DG method is proposed to deal with the\ndistribution shift via Visual Alignment and Uncertainty-guided belief Ensemble\n(VAUE).

For the conditional shift, we adopt an uncertainty-guided belief\nensemble strategy based on the subjective logic and Dempster-Shafer theory. The\nconditional distribution given a test sample is estimated by the dynamic\ncombination of that of source domains.

This bottleneck\nseverely worsens the inference time in the scene with a large number of points.\nThis paper proposes SoftGroup++ to address this computational bottleneck and\nfurther optimize the inference speed of the whole network. SoftGroup++ is built\nupon SoftGroup, which differs in three important aspects: (1) performs octree\n$k$-NN instead of vanilla $k$-NN to reduce time complexity from\n$\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(n \\log n)$, (2) performs pyramid scaling\nthat adaptively downsamples backbone outputs to reduce search space for $k$-NN\nand grouping, and (3) performs late devoxelization that delays the conversion\nfrom voxels to points towards the end of the model such that intermediate\ncomponents operate at a low computational cost. Extensive experiments on\nvarious indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed\nSoftGroup++.

The detailed way of rewiring is\ndetermined by comparing the similarity of label/feature-distribution of node\nneighbors. Besides, we design a scalable implementation for DHGR to guarantee\nhigh efficiency. DHRG can be easily used as a plug-in module, i.e., a graph\npre-processing step, for any GNNs, including both GNN for homophily and\nheterophily, to boost their performance on the node classification task.

Given a target\nimage to search, an embodied robot utilizes semantic memory to find the target\nin an unknown environment. % The semantic graph memory is collected from a\npanoramic observation of an RGB-D camera without knowing the robot's pose. In\nthis paper, we present a topological semantic graph memory (TSGM), which\nconsists of (1) a graph builder that takes the observed RGB-D image to\nconstruct a topological semantic graph, (2) a cross graph mixer module that\ntakes the collected nodes to get contextual information, and (3) a memory\ndecoder that takes the contextual memory as an input to find an action to the\ntarget. On the task of image goal navigation, TSGM significantly outperforms\ncompetitive baselines by +5.0-9.0% on the success rate and +7.0-23.5% on SPL,\nwhich means that the TSGM finds efficient paths.

Unlike explicit\nrepresentation that represents light fields as Sub-Aperture Images (SAIs) based\narrays or Micro-Images (MIs) based lenslet images, implicit representation\ntreats light fields as neural networks, which is inherently a continuous\nrepresentation in contrast to discrete explicit representation. However, at\npresent almost all the implicit representations for light fields utilize SAIs\nto train an MLP to learn a pixel-wise mapping from 4D spatial-angular\ncoordinate to pixel colors, which is neither compact nor of low complexity.\nInstead, in this paper we propose MiNL, a novel MI-wise implicit neural\nrepresentation for light fields that train an MLP + CNN to learn a mapping from\n2D MI coordinates to MI colors. Given the micro-image's coordinate, MiNL\noutputs the corresponding micro-image's RGB values. Light field encoding in\nMiNL is just training a neural network to regress the micro-images and the\ndecoding process is a simple feedforward operation.

Recently, many novel approaches have\nbeen proposed, especially deep learning-based approaches, such as CamCoder,\nGENRE, and BLINK. In this paper, a spatial clustering-based voting approach\nthat combines several individual approaches is proposed to improve SOTA\nperformance in terms of robustness and generalizability. Experiments are\nconducted to compare a voting ensemble with 20 latest and commonly-used\napproaches based on 12 public datasets, including several highly ambiguous and\nchallenging datasets (e.g., WikToR and CLDW). The datasets are of six types:\ntweets, historical documents, news, web pages, scientific articles, and\nWikipedia articles, containing in total 98,300 places across the world. The\nresults show that the voting ensemble performs the best on all the datasets,\nachieving an average Accuracy@161km of 0.86, proving the generalizability and\nrobustness of the voting approach.

    "abstract": "The past decade has witnessed transformative applications of deep learning in\nvarious computational imaging, sensing and microscopy tasks. Due to the\nsupervised learning schemes employed, most of these methods depend on\nlarge-scale, diverse, and labeled training data. The acquisition and\npreparation of such training image datasets are often laborious and costly,\nalso leading to biased estimation and limited generalization to new types of\nsamples. Here, we report a self-supervised learning model, termed GedankenNet,\nthat eliminates the need for labeled or experimental training data, and\ndemonstrate its effectiveness and superior generalization on hologram\nreconstruction tasks. Without prior knowledge about the sample types to be\nimaged, the self-supervised learning model was trained using a\nphysics-consistency loss and artificial random images that are synthetically\ngenerated without any experiments or resemblance to real-world samples. After\nits self-supervised training, GedankenNet successfully generalized to\nexperimental holograms of various unseen biological samples, reconstructing the\nphase and amplitude images of different types of objects using experimentally\nacquired test holograms. Without access to experimental data or the knowledge\nof real samples of interest or their spatial features, GedankenNet's\nself-supervised learning achieved complex-valued image reconstructions that are\nconsistent with the Maxwell's equations, meaning that its output inference and\nobject solutions accurately represent the wave propagation in free-space.

    "abstract": "Recently audio-driven talking face video generation has attracted\nconsiderable attention. However, very few researches address the issue of\nemotional editing of these talking face videos with continuously controllable\nexpressions, which is a strong demand in the industry. The challenge is that\nspeech-related expressions and emotion-related expressions are often highly\ncoupled. Meanwhile, traditional image-to-image translation methods cannot work\nwell in our application due to the coupling of expressions with other\nattributes such as poses, i.e., translating the expression of the character in\neach frame may simultaneously change the head pose due to the bias of the\ntraining data distribution. In this paper, we propose a high-quality facial\nexpression editing method for talking face videos, allowing the user to control\nthe target emotion in the edited video continuously. We present a new\nperspective for this task as a special case of motion information editing,\nwhere we use a 3DMM to capture major facial movements and an associated texture\nmap modeled by a StyleGAN to capture appearance details. Both representations\n(3DMM and texture map) contain emotional information and can be continuously\nmodified by neural networks and easily smoothed by averaging in\ncoefficient/latent spaces, making our method simple yet effective. We also\nintroduce a mouth shape preservation loss to control the trade-off between lip\nsynchronization and the degree of exaggeration of the edited expression.\nExtensive experiments and a user study show that our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across various evaluation criteria.",

    "title": "AdaCC: Cumulative Cost-Sensitive Boosting for Imbalanced Classification",
    "abstract": "Class imbalance poses a major challenge for machine learning as most\nsupervised learning models might exhibit bias towards the majority class and\nunder-perform in the minority class. Cost-sensitive learning tackles this\nproblem by treating the classes differently, formulated typically via a\nuser-defined fixed misclassification cost matrix provided as input to the\nlearner. Such parameter tuning is a challenging task that requires domain\nknowledge and moreover, wrong adjustments might lead to overall predictive\nperformance deterioration. In this work, we propose a novel cost-sensitive\nboosting approach for imbalanced data that dynamically adjusts the\nmisclassification costs over the boosting rounds in response to model's\nperformance instead of using a fixed misclassification cost matrix. Our method,\ncalled AdaCC, is parameter-free as it relies on the cumulative behavior of the\nboosting model in order to adjust the misclassification costs for the next\nboosting round and comes with theoretical guarantees regarding the training\nerror. Experiments on 27 real-world datasets from different domains with high\nclass imbalance demonstrate the superiority of our method over 12\nstate-of-the-art cost-sensitive boosting approaches exhibiting consistent\nimprovements in different measures, for instance, in the range of [0.3%-28.56%]\nfor AUC, [3.4%-21.4%] for balanced accuracy, [4.8%-45%] for gmean and\n[7.4%-85.5%] for recall.",

    "title": "Learning to Weight Samples for Dynamic Early-exiting Networks",
    "abstract": "Early exiting is an effective paradigm for improving the inference efficiency\nof deep networks. By constructing classifiers with varying resource demands\n(the exits), such networks allow easy samples to be output at early exits,\nremoving the need for executing deeper layers. While existing works mainly\nfocus on the architectural design of multi-exit networks, the training\nstrategies for such models are largely left unexplored. The current\nstate-of-the-art models treat all samples the same during training. However,\nthe early-exiting behavior during testing has been ignored, leading to a gap\nbetween training and testing. In this paper, we propose to bridge this gap by\nsample weighting. Intuitively, easy samples, which generally exit early in the\nnetwork during inference, should contribute more to training early classifiers.\nThe training of hard samples (mostly exit from deeper layers), however, should\nbe emphasized by the late classifiers. Our work proposes to adopt a weight\nprediction network to weight the loss of different training samples at each\nexit. This weight prediction network and the backbone model are jointly\noptimized under a meta-learning framework with a novel optimization objective.\nBy bringing the adaptive behavior during inference into the training phase, we\nshow that the proposed weighting mechanism consistently improves the trade-off\nbetween classification accuracy and inference efficiency.

Our\napproach accounts for temporal-topological patterns that unfold in the causal\ntopology of dynamic graphs, which is determined by causal walks, i.e.\ntemporally ordered sequences of links by which nodes can influence each other\nover time. Our architecture builds on multiple layers of higher-order De Bruijn\ngraphs, an iterative line graph construction where nodes in a De Bruijn graph\nof order k represent walks of length k-1, while edges represent walks of length\nk. We develop a graph neural network architecture that utilizes De Bruijn\ngraphs to implement a message passing scheme that follows a non-Markovian\ndynamics, which enables us to learn patterns in the causal topology of a\ndynamic graph. Addressing the issue that De Bruijn graphs with different orders\nk can be used to model the same data set, we further apply statistical model\nselection to determine the optimal graph topology to be used for message\npassing.

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) algorithms are gaining increased importance in many\nacademic and industrial applications, and such algorithms are, accordingly,\nbecoming common components in computer science curricula. Learning ML is\nchallenging not only due to its complex mathematical and algorithmic aspects,\nbut also due to a) the complexity of using correctly these algorithms in the\ncontext of real-life situations and b) the understanding of related social and\nethical issues. Cognitive biases are phenomena of the human brain that may\ncause erroneous perceptions and irrational decision-making processes. As such,\nthey have been researched thoroughly in the context of cognitive psychology and\ndecision making; they do, however, have important implications for computer\nscience education as well. One well-known cognitive bias, first described by\nKahneman and Tversky, is the base rate neglect bias, according to which humans\nfail to consider the base rate of the underlaying phenomena when evaluating\nconditional probabilities. In this paper, we explore the expression of the base\nrate neglect bias in ML education. Specifically, we show that about one third\nof students in an Introduction to ML course, from varied backgrounds (computer\nscience students and teachers, data science, engineering, social science and\ndigital humanities), fail to correctly evaluate ML algorithm performance due to\nthe base rate neglect bias. This failure rate should alert educators and\npromote the development of new pedagogical methods for teaching ML algorithm\nperformance.",

Individual discrimination\nmay occur when an AI model makes different decisions for two distinct\nindividuals who are distinguishable solely according to protected attributes,\nsuch as age and race. Such instances reveal biased AI behaviour, and are called\nIndividual Discriminatory Instances (IDIs).\nIn this paper, we propose an approach for the selection of the initial seeds\nto generate IDIs for fairness testing. Previous studies mainly used random\ninitial seeds to this end. However this phase is crucial, as these seeds are\nthe basis of the follow-up IDIs generation. We dubbed our proposed seed\nselection approach I&D. It generates a large number of initial IDIs exhibiting\na great diversity, aiming at improving the overall performance of fairness\ntesting.\nOur empirical study reveal that I&D is able to produce a larger number of\nIDIs with respect to four state-of-the-art seed generation approaches,\ngenerating 1.68X more IDIs on average. Moreover, we compare the use of I&D to\ntrain machine learning models and find that using I&D reduces the number of\nremaining IDIs by 29% when compared to the state-of-the-art, thus indicating\nthat I&D is effective for improving model fairness",

    "abstract": "Moving Object Detection (MOD) is a critical vision task for successfully\nachieving safe autonomous driving. Despite plausible results of deep learning\nmethods, most existing approaches are only frame-based and may fail to reach\nreasonable performance when dealing with dynamic traffic participants. Recent\nadvances in sensor technologies, especially the Event camera, can naturally\ncomplement the conventional camera approach to better model moving objects.\nHowever, event-based works often adopt a pre-defined time window for event\nrepresentation, and simply integrate it to estimate image intensities from\nevents, neglecting much of the rich temporal information from the available\nasynchronous events. Therefore, from a new perspective, we propose RENet, a\nnovel RGB-Event fusion Network, that jointly exploits the two complementary\nmodalities to achieve more robust MOD under challenging scenarios for\nautonomous driving. Specifically, we first design a temporal multi-scale\naggregation module to fully leverage event frames from both the RGB exposure\ntime and larger intervals. Then we introduce a bi-directional fusion module to\nattentively calibrate and fuse multi-modal features. To evaluate the\nperformance of our network, we carefully select and annotate a sub-MOD dataset\nfrom the commonly used DSEC dataset.

MPC\nrequires more computation power in comparison to other controllers, such as PID\nor LQR, since it use cost functions, optimization methods and iteratively\npredicts the output of the system and the control commands for some determined\nsteps in the future (prediction horizon). Thus, the computation power required\ndepends on the prediction horizon, the complexity of the cost functions and the\noptimization. The more steps determined for the horizon the more efficient the\ncontroller can be, but also more computation power is required. Since sometimes\nrobots are not capable of managing all the computing process locally, it is\nimportant to offload some of the computing process from the robot to the cloud.\nBut then some disadvantages may occur, such as latency and safety issues. Cloud\ncomputing may offer \"infinity\" computation power but the whole system suffers\nin latency. A solution to this is the use of Edge Computing, which will reduce\ntime delays since the Edge device is much closer to the source of data.\nMoreover, by using the Edge we can offload the demanding controller from the\nUAV and set a longer prediction horizon and try to get a more efficient\ncontroller.",

    "abstract": "Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is the ability of a robotic platform to\ncorrectly interpret visual stimuli from its on-board cameras in order to\ndetermine whether it is currently located in a previously visited place,\ndespite different viewpoint, illumination and appearance changes. JPEG is a\nwidely used image compression standard that is capable of significantly\nreducing the size of an image at the cost of image clarity. For applications\nwhere several robotic platforms are simultaneously deployed, the visual data\ngathered must be transmitted remotely between each robot. Hence, JPEG\ncompression can be employed to drastically reduce the amount of data\ntransmitted over a communication channel, as working with limited bandwidth for\nVPR can be proven to be a challenging task. However, the effects of JPEG\ncompression on the performance of current VPR techniques have not been\npreviously studied. For this reason, this paper presents an in-depth study of\nJPEG compression in VPR related scenarios. We use a selection of\nwell-established VPR techniques on 8 datasets with various amounts of\ncompression applied. We show that by introducing compression, the VPR\nperformance is drastically reduced, especially in the higher spectrum of\ncompression. To overcome the negative effects of JPEG compression on the VPR\nperformance, we present a fine-tuned CNN which is optimized for JPEG compressed\ndata and show that it performs more consistently with the image transformations\ndetected in extremely compressed JPEG images.",

    "abstract": "Single-view point cloud completion aims to recover the full geometry of an\nobject based on only limited observation, which is extremely hard due to the\ndata sparsity and occlusion. The core challenge is to generate plausible\ngeometries to fill the unobserved part of the object based on a partial scan,\nwhich is under-constrained and suffers from a huge solution space. Inspired by\nthe classic shadow volume technique in computer graphics, we propose a new\nmethod to reduce the solution space effectively. Our method considers the\ncamera a light source that casts rays toward the object. Such light rays build\na reasonably constrained but sufficiently expressive basis for completion. The\ncompletion process is then formulated as a point displacement optimization\nproblem. Points are initialized at the partial scan and then moved to their\ngoal locations with two types of movements for each point: directional\nmovements along the light rays and constrained local movement for shape\nrefinement. We design neural networks to predict the ideal point movements to\nget the completion results. We demonstrate that our method is accurate, robust,\nand generalizable through exhaustive evaluation and comparison. Moreover, it\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively on MVP\ndatasets.",

    "abstract": "Flocking control is a challenging problem, where multiple agents, such as\ndrones or vehicles, need to reach a target position while maintaining the flock\nand avoiding collisions with obstacles and collisions among agents in the\nenvironment. Multi-agent reinforcement learning has achieved promising\nperformance in flocking control. However, methods based on traditional\nreinforcement learning require a considerable number of interactions between\nagents and the environment. This paper proposes a sub-optimal policy aided\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning algorithm (SPA-MARL) to boost sample\nefficiency. SPA-MARL directly leverages a prior policy that can be manually\ndesigned or solved with a non-learning method to aid agents in learning, where\nthe performance of the policy can be sub-optimal. SPA-MARL recognizes the\ndifference in performance between the sub-optimal policy and itself, and then\nimitates the sub-optimal policy if the sub-optimal policy is better. We\nleverage SPA-MARL to solve the flocking control problem. A traditional control\nmethod based on artificial potential fields is used to generate a sub-optimal\npolicy. Experiments demonstrate that SPA-MARL can speed up the training process\nand outperform both the MARL baseline and the used sub-optimal policy.",

This has culminated in the\ndesign of practices that promote quality in the designed software. Originating\nfrom the inception of the traditional software development life cycle (SDLC),\nthrough to the object-oriented methods, Iterative development, and now the\nagile methods, these practices have persisted through different periods. Such\npractices play the same quality role regardless of the perspective of the\nsoftware development process they are part of. In this paper we review three\nsoftware development methods representative of the software development\nhistory, with the aim of i) identifying key quality practices, ii) identifying\nthe quality role played by the practice in the method, and iii) noting those\nquality practices that have persisted through the software development history.\nThe identified quality practices that have persisted throughout the history of\nthe software development processes include prototyping, iterative development,\nincremental development, risk-driven development, phase planning, and phase\nretrospection. These results would be useful to method engineers who seek to\ndesign high-quality software development methods as these practices serve as\ncandidates for inclusion in their development processes. Software development\npractitioners seeking to design quality software would also benefit from\nadopting these practices in developing their software.",

Even though extractive question-answering using\nneural approaches has been studied widely in natural languages, the problem of\nanswering semantic queries over code using neural networks has not yet been\nexplored. This is mainly because there is no existing dataset with extractive\nquestion and answer pairs over code involving complex concepts and long chains\nof reasoning. We bridge this gap by building a new, curated dataset called\nCodeQueries, and proposing a neural question-answering methodology over code.\nWe build upon state-of-the-art pre-trained models of code to predict answer\nand supporting-fact spans. Given a query and code, only some of the code may be\nrelevant to answer the query. We first experiment under an ideal setting where\nonly the relevant code is given to the model and show that our models do well.\nWe then experiment under three pragmatic considerations: (1) scaling to\nlarge-size code, (2) learning from a limited number of examples and (3)\nrobustness to minor syntax errors in code. Our results show that while a neural\nmodel can be resilient to minor syntax errors in code, increasing size of code,\npresence of code that is not relevant to the query, and reduced number of\ntraining examples limit the model performance.

    "abstract": "We propose a simple modification to standard ResNet architectures--L2\nregularization over feature space--that substantially improves\nout-of-distribution (OoD) performance on the previously proposed Deep\nDeterministic Uncertainty (DDU) benchmark. This change also induces early\nNeural Collapse (NC), which we show is an effect under which better OoD\nperformance is more probable. Our method achieves comparable or superior OoD\ndetection scores and classification accuracy in a small fraction of the\ntraining time of the benchmark. Additionally, it substantially improves worst\ncase OoD performance over multiple, randomly initialized models. Though we do\nnot suggest that NC is the sole mechanism or comprehensive explanation for OoD\nbehaviour in deep neural networks (DNN), we believe NC's simple mathematical\nand geometric structure can provide an framework for analysis of this complex\nphenomenon in future work.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of developing an algorithm for autonomous\nship landing of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capable unmanned aerial\nvehicles (UAVs), using only a monocular camera in the UAV for tracking and\nlocalization. Ship landing is a challenging task due to the small landing\nspace, six degrees of freedom ship deck motion, limited visual references for\nlocalization, and adversarial environmental conditions such as wind gusts. We\nfirst develop a computer vision algorithm which estimates the relative position\nof the UAV with respect to a horizon reference bar on the landing platform\nusing the image stream from a monocular vision camera on the UAV. Our approach\nis motivated by the actual ship landing procedure followed by the Navy\nhelicopter pilots in tracking the horizon reference bar as a visual cue. We\nthen develop a robust reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for controlling the\nUAV towards the landing platform even in the presence of adversarial\nenvironmental conditions such as wind gusts. We demonstrate the superior\nperformance of our algorithm compared to a benchmark nonlinear PID control\napproach, both in the simulation experiments using the Gazebo environment and\nin the real-world setting using a Parrot ANAFI quad-rotor and sub-scale ship\nplatform undergoing 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) deck motion.",

    "title": "Practical LR Parser Generation",
    "abstract": "Parsing is a fundamental building block in modern compilers, and for\nindustrial programming languages, it is a surprisingly involved task. There are\nknown approaches to generate parsers automatically, but the prevailing\nconsensus is that automatic parser generation is not practical for real\nprogramming languages: LR/LALR parsers are considered to be far too restrictive\nin the grammars they support, and LR parsers are often considered too\ninefficient in practice. As a result, virtually all modern languages use\nrecursive-descent parsers written by hand, a lengthy and error-prone process\nthat dramatically increases the barrier to new programming language\ndevelopment.\nIn this work we demonstrate that, contrary to the prevailing consensus, we\ncan have the best of both worlds: for a very general, practical class of\ngrammars -- a strict superset of Knuth's canonical LR -- we can generate\nparsers automatically, and the resulting parser code, as well as the generation\nprocedure itself, is highly efficient. This advance relies on several new\nideas, including novel automata optimization procedures; a new grammar\ntransformation (\"CPS\"); per-symbol attributes; recursive-descent actions; and\nan extension of canonical LR parsing, which we refer to as XLR, which endows\nshift/reduce parsers with the power of bounded nondeterministic choice.\nWith these ingredients, we can automatically generate efficient parsers for\nvirtually all programming languages that are intuitively easy to parse -- a\nclaim we support experimentally, by implementing the new algorithms in a new\nsoftware tool called langcc, and running them on syntax specifications for\nGolang 1.17.8 and Python 3.9.12. The tool handles both languages automatically,\nand the generated code, when run on standard codebases, is 1.2x faster than the\ncorresponding hand-written parser for Golang, and 4.3x faster than the CPython\nparser, respectively.",

The approximation problem seeks accurate\napproximations with a minimal number of weights. In most of the current\nliterature these weights are fully or partially hand-crafted, showing the\ncapabilities of neural networks but not necessarily their practical\nperformance. In contrast, optimization theory for neural networks heavily\nrelies on an abundance of weights in over-parametrized regimes.\nThis paper balances these two demands and provides an approximation result\nfor shallow networks in $1d$ with non-convex weight optimization by gradient\ndescent. We consider finite width networks and infinite sample limits, which is\nthe typical setup in approximation theory.

    "abstract": "In multi-robot applications, inference over large state spaces can often be\ndivided into smaller overlapping sub-problems that can then be collaboratively\nsolved in parallel over `separate' subsets of states. To this end, the factor\ngraph decentralized data fusion (FG-DDF) framework was developed to analyze and\nexploit conditional independence in heterogeneous Bayesian decentralized fusion\nproblems, in which robots update and fuse pdfs over different locally\noverlapping random states. This allows robots to efficiently use smaller\nprobabilistic models and sparse message passing to accurately and scalably fuse\nrelevant local parts of a larger global joint state pdf, while accounting for\ndata dependencies between robots. Whereas prior work required limiting\nassumptions about network connectivity and model linearity, this paper relaxes\nthese to empirically explore the applicability and robustness of FG-DDF in more\ngeneral settings. We develop a new heterogeneous fusion rule which generalizes\nthe homogeneous covariance intersection algorithm, and test it in multi-robot\ntracking and localization scenarios with non-linear motion/observation models\nunder communication dropout. Simulation and linear hardware experiments show\nthat, in practice, the FG-DDF continues to provide consistent filtered\nestimates under these more practical operating conditions, while reducing\ncomputation and communication costs by more than 95%, thus enabling the design\nof scalable real-world multi-robot systems.",

The algorithm enables the advertiser\nto search across available target audiences and ad-media to find the best\npossible combination for its campaign via online experimentation. The problem\nof finding the best audience-ad combination is complicated by a number of\ndistinctive challenges, including (a) a need for active exploration to resolve\nprior uncertainty and to speed the search for profitable combinations, (b) many\ncombinations to choose from, giving rise to high-dimensional search\nformulations, and (c) very low success probabilities, typically just a fraction\nof one percent. Our algorithm (designated LRDL, an acronym for Logistic\nRegression with Debiased Lasso) addresses these challenges by combining four\nelements: a multiarmed bandit framework for active exploration; a Lasso penalty\nfunction to handle high dimensionality; an inbuilt debiasing kernel that\nhandles the regularization bias induced by the Lasso; and a semi-parametric\nregression model for outcomes that promotes cross-learning across arms.

Contrary to the existing solution to this problem, we leverage the\npopular neural radiance fields-based object representation, which has recently\nshown impressive results for various computer vision tasks. However, it is not\nstraightforward to directly reason about an object's explicit 3D geometric\ndetails using such a representation, making the next-best-view selection\nproblem for dense 3D reconstruction challenging.

    "abstract": "Spatial-temporal Map (STMap)-based methods have shown great potential to\nprocess high-angle videos for vehicle trajectory reconstruction, which can meet\nthe needs of various data-driven modeling and imitation learning applications.\nIn this paper, we developed Spatial-Temporal Deep Embedding (STDE) model that\nimposes parity constraints at both pixel and instance levels to generate\ninstance-aware embeddings for vehicle stripe segmentation on STMap. At pixel\nlevel, each pixel was encoded with its 8-neighbor pixels at different ranges,\nand this encoding is subsequently used to guide a neural network to learn the\nembedding mechanism. At the instance level, a discriminative loss function is\ndesigned to pull pixels belonging to the same instance closer and separate the\nmean value of different instances far apart in the embedding space. The output\nof the spatial-temporal affinity is then optimized by the mutex-watershed\nalgorithm to obtain final clustering results. Based on segmentation metrics,\nour model outperformed five other baselines that have been used for STMap\nprocessing and shows robustness under the influence of shadows, static noises,\nand overlapping. The designed model is applied to process all public NGSIM\nUS-101 videos to generate complete vehicle trajectories, indicating a good\nscalability and adaptability. Last but not least, the strengths of the scanline\nmethod with STDE and future directions were discussed. Code, STMap dataset and\nvideo trajectory are made publicly available in the online repository. GitHub\nLink: shorturl.at/jklT0.",

    "abstract": "Development of an accurate, flexible, and numerically efficient uncertainty\nquantification (UQ) method is one of fundamental challenges in machine\nlearning. Previously, a UQ method called DISCO Nets has been proposed\n(Bouchacourt et al., 2016) that trains a neural network by minimizing the\nso-called energy score on training data. This method has shown superior\nperformance on a hand pose estimation task in computer vision, but it remained\nunclear whether this method works as nicely for regression on tabular data, and\nhow it competes with more recent advanced UQ methods such as NGBoost. In this\npaper, we propose an improved neural architecture of DISCO Nets that admits a\nmore stable and smooth training. We benchmark this approach on miscellaneous\nreal-world tabular datasets and confirm that it is competitive with or even\nsuperior to standard UQ baselines. We also provide a new elementary proof for\nthe validity of using the energy score to learn predictive distributions.\nFurther, we point out that DISCO Nets in its original form ignore epistemic\nuncertainty and only capture aleatoric uncertainty. We propose a simple fix to\nthis problem.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related mortality by a significant\nmargin. While new technologies, such as image segmentation, have been paramount\nto improved detection and earlier diagnoses, there are still significant\nchallenges in treating the disease. In particular, despite an increased number\nof curative resections, many postoperative patients still develop recurrent\nlesions. Consequently, there is a significant need for prognostic tools that\ncan more accurately predict a patient's risk for recurrence.\nIn this paper, we explore the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for\nthe segmentation and recurrence risk prediction of lung tumors that are present\nin preoperative computed tomography (CT) images. First, expanding upon recent\nprogress in medical image segmentation, a residual U-Net is used to localize\nand characterize each nodule. Then, the identified tumors are passed to a\nsecond CNN for recurrence risk prediction. The system's final results are\nproduced with a random forest classifier that synthesizes the predictions of\nthe second network with clinical attributes. The segmentation stage uses the\nLIDC-IDRI dataset and achieves a dice score of 70.3%. The recurrence risk stage\nuses the NLST dataset from the National Cancer institute and achieves an AUC of\n73.0%. Our proposed framework demonstrates that first, automated nodule\nsegmentation methods can generalize to enable pipelines for a wide range of\nmultitask systems and second, that deep learning and image processing have the\npotential to improve current prognostic tools.

The first is the existing feed-forward inference framework\nwhere patterns in given data are sensed and associated with previously learned\npatterns.

Together, we term the two stages as introspective\nlearning. We use gradients of trained neural networks as a measurement of this\nreflection. A simple three-layered Multi Layer Perceptron is used as the second\nstage that predicts based on all extracted gradient features. We perceptually\nvisualize the post-hoc explanations from both stages to provide a visual\ngrounding to introspection. For the application of recognition, we show that an\nintrospective network is 4% more robust and 42% less prone to calibration\nerrors when generalizing to noisy data. We also illustrate the value of\nintrospective networks in downstream tasks that require generalizability and\ncalibration including active learning, out-of-distribution detection, and\nuncertainty estimation.

Even\nwhen the API's aggregate performance stays steady, its error modes can shift\nacross different subtypes of data between 2020 and 2022. Such changes can\nsubstantially impact the entire analytics pipelines that use some ML API as a\ncomponent.

    "abstract": "With the outbreak of today's streaming data, sequential recommendation is a\npromising solution to achieve time-aware personalized modeling. It aims to\ninfer the next interacted item of given user based on history item sequence.\nSome recent works tend to improve the sequential recommendation via randomly\nmasking on the history item so as to generate self-supervised signals. But such\napproach will indeed result in sparser item sequence and unreliable signals.\nBesides, the existing sequential recommendation is only user-centric, i.e.,\nbased on the historical items by chronological order to predict the probability\nof candidate items, which ignores whether the items from a provider can be\nsuccessfully recommended. The such user-centric recommendation will make it\nimpossible for the provider to expose their new items and result in popular\nbias.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel Dual Contrastive Network (DCN) to generate\nground-truth self-supervised signals for sequential recommendation by auxiliary\nuser-sequence from item-centric perspective. Specifically, we propose dual\nrepresentation contrastive learning to refine the representation learning by\nminimizing the euclidean distance between the representations of given\nuser/item and history items/users of them. Before the second contrastive\nlearning module, we perform next user prediction to to capture the trends of\nitems preferred by certain types of users and provide personalized exploration\nopportunities for item providers. Finally, we further propose dual interest\ncontrastive learning to self-supervise the dynamic interest from next item/user\nprediction and static interest of matching probability.

    "abstract": "In the last few years, many explanation methods based on the perturbations of\ninput data have been introduced to improve our understanding of decisions made\nby black-box models. The goal of this work is to introduce a novel perturbation\nscheme so that more faithful and robust explanations can be obtained. Our study\nfocuses on the impact of perturbing directions on the data topology. We show\nthat perturbing along the orthogonal directions of the input manifold better\npreserves the data topology, both in the worst-case analysis of the discrete\nGromov-Hausdorff distance and in the average-case analysis via persistent\nhomology. From those results, we introduce EMaP algorithm, realizing the\northogonal perturbation scheme. Our experiments show that EMaP not only\nimproves the explainers' performance but also helps them overcome a\nrecently-developed attack against perturbation-based methods.",

    "abstract": "Transparent objects are widely used in industrial automation and daily life.\nHowever, robust visual recognition and perception of transparent objects have\nalways been a major challenge. Currently, most commercial-grade depth cameras\nare still not good at sensing the surfaces of transparent objects due to the\nrefraction and reflection of light. In this work, we present a\ntransformer-based transparent object depth estimation approach from a single\nRGB-D input. We observe that the global characteristics of the transformer make\nit easier to extract contextual information to perform depth estimation of\ntransparent areas. In addition, to better enhance the fine-grained features, a\nfeature fusion module (FFM) is designed to assist coherent prediction. Our\nempirical evidence demonstrates that our model delivers significant\nimprovements in recent popular datasets, e.g., 25% gain on RMSE and 21% gain on\nREL compared to previous state-of-the-art convolutional-based counterparts in\nClearGrasp dataset. Extensive results show that our transformer-based model\nenables better aggregation of the object's RGB and inaccurate depth information\nto obtain a better depth representation.

Next, a data-driven\nrepresentation of the S2S dynamics of the robot is learned online via classical\nadaptive control methods.

    "abstract": "Obstacle detection is a safety-critical problem in robot navigation, where\nstereo matching is a popular vision-based approach. While deep neural networks\nhave shown impressive results in computer vision, most of the previous obstacle\ndetection works only leverage traditional stereo matching techniques to meet\nthe computational constraints for real-time feedback. This paper proposes a\ncomputationally efficient method that leverages a deep neural network to detect\noccupancy from stereo images directly. Instead of learning the point cloud\ncorrespondence from the stereo data, our approach extracts the compact obstacle\ndistribution based on volumetric representations. In addition, we prune the\ncomputation of safety irrelevant spaces in a coarse-to-fine manner based on\noctrees generated by the decoder. As a result, we achieve real-time performance\non the onboard computer (NVIDIA Jetson TX2). Our approach detects obstacles\naccurately in the range of 32 meters and achieves better IoU (Intersection over\nUnion) and CD (Chamfer Distance) scores with only 2% of the computation cost of\nthe state-of-the-art stereo model. Furthermore, we validate our method's\nrobustness and real-world feasibility through autonomous navigation experiments\nwith a real robot. Hence, our work contributes toward closing the gap between\nthe stereo-based system in robot perception and state-of-the-art stereo models\nin computer vision. To counter the scarcity of high-quality real-world indoor\nstereo datasets, we collect a 1.36 hours stereo dataset with a Jackal robot\nwhich is used to fine-tune our model.

    "abstract": "The random Fourier features (RFFs) method is a powerful and popular technique\nin kernel approximation for scalability of kernel methods. The theoretical\nfoundation of RFFs is based on the Bochner theorem that relates symmetric,\npositive definite (PD) functions to probability measures. This condition\nnaturally excludes asymmetric functions with a wide range applications in\npractice, e.g., directed graphs, conditional probability, and asymmetric\nkernels. Nevertheless, understanding asymmetric functions (kernels) and its\nscalability via RFFs is unclear both theoretically and empirically. In this\npaper, we introduce a complex measure with the real and imaginary parts\ncorresponding to four finite positive measures, which expands the application\nscope of the Bochner theorem. By doing so, this framework allows for handling\nclassical symmetric, PD kernels via one positive measure; symmetric,\nnon-positive definite kernels via signed measures; and asymmetric kernels via\ncomplex measures, thereby unifying them into a general framework by RFFs, named\nAsK-RFFs. Such approximation scheme via complex measures enjoys theoretical\nguarantees in the perspective of the uniform convergence. In algorithmic\nimplementation, to speed up the kernel approximation process, which is\nexpensive due to the calculation of total mass, we employ a subset-based fast\nestimation method that optimizes total masses on a sub-training set, which\nenjoys computational efficiency in high dimensions. Our AsK-RFFs method is\nempirically validated on several typical large-scale datasets and achieves\npromising kernel approximation performance, which demonstrate the effectiveness\nof AsK-RFFs.",

    "abstract": "Forking breaches the security and performance of blockchain as it is\nsymptomatic of distributed consensus, spurring wide interest in analyzing and\nresolving it. The state-of-the-art works can be categorized into two kinds:\nexperiment-based and model-based. However, the former falls short in\nexclusiveness since the derived observations are scenario-specific. Hence, it\nis problematic to abstractly reveal the crystal-clear forking laws. Besides,\nthe models established in the latter are spatiality-free, which totally\noverlook the fact that forking is essentially an undesirable result under a\ngiven topology. Moreover, few of the ongoing studies have yielded to the active\ndefense mechanisms but only recognized forking passively, which impedes forking\nprevention and cannot deter it at the source. In this paper, we fill the gap by\ncarrying out the active defense analysis of blockchain forking from the\nspatial-temporal dimension. Our work is featured by the following two traits:\n1) dual dimensions. We consider the spatiality of blockchain overlay network\nbesides temporal characteristics, based on which, a spatial-temporal model for\ninformation propagation in blockchain is proposed; 2) active defense. We hint\nthat shrinking the long-range link factor, which indicates the remote\nconnection ability of a link, can cut down forking completely fundamentally. To\nthe best of our knowledge, we are the first to inspect forking from the\nspatial-temporal perspective, so as to present countermeasures proactively.\nSolid theoretical derivations and extensive simulations are conducted to\njustify the validity and effectiveness of our analysis.",

    "abstract": "While reinforcement learning (RL) methods that learn an internal model of the\nenvironment have the potential to be more sample efficient than their\nmodel-free counterparts, learning to model raw observations from high\ndimensional sensors can be challenging. Prior work has addressed this challenge\nby learning low-dimensional representation of observations through auxiliary\nobjectives, such as reconstruction or value prediction. However, the alignment\nbetween these auxiliary objectives and the RL objective is often unclear. In\nthis work, we propose a single objective which jointly optimizes a latent-space\nmodel and policy to achieve high returns while remaining self-consistent. This\nobjective is a lower bound on expected returns. Unlike prior bounds for\nmodel-based RL on policy exploration or model guarantees, our bound is directly\non the overall RL objective. We demonstrate that the resulting algorithm\nmatches or improves the sample-efficiency of the best prior model-based and\nmodel-free RL methods.

Coordination at high levels of the hierarchy\nis handled by the alternating optimization method, which converges very\nquickly.

    "abstract": "We have recently seen tremendous progress in the neural advances for\nphoto-real human modeling and rendering. However, it's still challenging to\nintegrate them into an existing mesh-based pipeline for downstream\napplications. In this paper, we present a comprehensive neural approach for\nhigh-quality reconstruction, compression, and rendering of human performances\nfrom dense multi-view videos. Our core intuition is to bridge the traditional\nanimated mesh workflow with a new class of highly efficient neural techniques.\nWe first introduce a neural surface reconstructor for high-quality surface\ngeneration in minutes. It marries the implicit volumetric rendering of the\ntruncated signed distance field (TSDF) with multi-resolution hash encoding. We\nfurther propose a hybrid neural tracker to generate animated meshes, which\ncombines explicit non-rigid tracking with implicit dynamic deformation in a\nself-supervised framework. The former provides the coarse warping back into the\ncanonical space, while the latter implicit one further predicts the\ndisplacements using the 4D hash encoding as in our reconstructor. Then, we\ndiscuss the rendering schemes using the obtained animated meshes, ranging from\ndynamic texturing to lumigraph rendering under various bandwidth settings. To\nstrike an intricate balance between quality and bandwidth, we propose a\nhierarchical solution by first rendering 6 virtual views covering the performer\nand then conducting occlusion-aware neural texture blending.

In this\npaper, we focus on the equi-join problem, where a pair of records from the two\njoined tables are part of the join results if equality holds between their\nvalues in the join column(s). While this is a tractable problem when the number\nof records in the joined tables is relatively small, it becomes very\nchallenging as the table sizes increase, especially if hot keys (join column\nvalues with a large number of records) exist in both joined tables.\nThis paper, an extended version of [metwally-SIGMOD-2022], proposes\nAdaptive-Multistage-Join (AM-Join) for scalable and fast equi-joins in\ndistributed shared-nothing architectures. AM-Join utilizes (a) Tree-Join, a\nproposed novel algorithm that scales well when the joined tables share hot\nkeys, and (b) Broadcast-Join, the known fastest when joining keys that are hot\nin only one table.\nUnlike the state-of-the-art algorithms, AM-Join (a) holistically solves the\njoin-skew problem by achieving load balancing throughout the join execution,\nand (b) supports all outer-join variants without record deduplication or custom\ntable partitioning. For the fastest AM-Join outer-join performance, we propose\nthe Index-Broadcast-Join (IB-Join) family of algorithms for Small-Large joins,\nwhere one table fits in memory and the other can be up to orders of magnitude\nlarger. The outer-join variants of IB-Join improves on the state-of-the-art\nSmall-Large outer-join algorithms.\nThe proposed algorithms can be adopted in any shared-nothing architecture.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces Honor of Kings Arena, a reinforcement learning (RL)\nenvironment based on Honor of Kings, one of the world's most popular games at\npresent. Compared to other environments studied in most previous work, ours\npresents new generalization challenges for competitive reinforcement learning.\nIt is a multi-agent problem with one agent competing against its opponent; and\nit requires the generalization ability as it has diverse targets to control and\ndiverse opponents to compete with. We describe the observation, action, and\nreward specifications for the Honor of Kings domain and provide an open-source\nPython-based interface for communicating with the game engine. We provide\ntwenty target heroes with a variety of tasks in Honor of Kings Arena and\npresent initial baseline results for RL-based methods with feasible computing\nresources. Finally, we showcase the generalization challenges imposed by Honor\nof Kings Arena and possible remedies to the challenges.

Fully-discrete numerical approximation schemes are\ngenerated for the null controllability of these parabolic-like PDEs. We mainly\nuse finite element method (FEM) and finite difference method (FDM)\napproximations to show that the null controllers being approximated via FEM and\nFDM exhibit exactly the same asymptotics of the associated minimal energy\nfunction. For this, we appeal to the theory originally given by R. Triggiani\n[20] for construction of null controllers of ODE systems. These null\ncontrollers are also amenable to our numerical implementation in which we\ndiscuss the aspects of FEM and FDM numerical approximations and compare both\nmethodologies.

    "abstract": "The growing use of probe vehicles generates a huge number of GNSS data.\nLimited by the satellite positioning technology, further improving the accuracy\nof map-matching is challenging work, especially for low-frequency trajectories.\nWhen matching a trajectory, the ego vehicle's spatial-temporal information of\nthe present trip is the most useful with the least amount of data. In addition,\nthere are a large amount of other data, e.g., other vehicles' state and past\nprediction results, but it is hard to extract useful information for matching\nmaps and inferring paths. Most map-matching studies only used the ego vehicle's\ndata and ignored other vehicles' data. Based on it, this paper designs a new\nmap-matching method to make full use of \"Big data\". We first sort all data into\nfour groups according to their spatial and temporal distance from the present\nmatching probe which allows us to sort for their usefulness. Then we design\nthree different methods to extract valuable information (scores) from them: a\nscore for speed and bearing, a score for historical usage, and a score for\ntraffic state using the spectral graph Markov neutral network. Finally, we use\na modified top-K shortest-path method to search the candidate paths within an\nellipse region and then use the fused score to infer the path (projected\nlocation). We test the proposed method against baseline algorithms using a\nreal-world dataset in China. The results show that all scoring methods can\nenhance map-matching accuracy.

The translation of an FGG\nprogram provides evidence for the availability of methods as additional\ndictionary parameters, similar to the dictionary-passing approach known from\nHaskell type classes. Then, method calls can be resolved by a simple lookup of\nthe method definition in the dictionary.\nEvery program in the image of the translation has the same dynamic semantics\nas its source FGG program.

    "title": "Adaptive Dimension Reduction and Variational Inference for Transductive  Few-Shot Classification",
    "abstract": "Transductive Few-Shot learning has gained increased attention nowadays\nconsidering the cost of data annotations along with the increased accuracy\nprovided by unlabelled samples in the domain of few shot. Especially in\nFew-Shot Classification (FSC), recent works explore the feature distributions\naiming at maximizing likelihoods or posteriors with respect to the unknown\nparameters. Following this vein, and considering the parallel between FSC and\nclustering, we seek for better taking into account the uncertainty in\nestimation due to lack of data, as well as better statistical properties of the\nclusters associated with each class. Therefore in this paper we propose a new\nclustering method based on Variational Bayesian inference, further improved by\nAdaptive Dimension Reduction based on Probabilistic Linear Discriminant\nAnalysis. Our proposed method significantly improves accuracy in the realistic\nunbalanced transductive setting on various Few-Shot benchmarks when applied to\nfeatures used in previous studies, with a gain of up to $6\\%$ in accuracy. In\naddition, when applied to balanced setting, we obtain very competitive results\nwithout making use of the class-balance artefact which is disputable for\npractical use cases. We also provide the performance of our method on a high\nperforming pretrained backbone, with the reported results further surpassing\nthe current state-of-the-art accuracy, suggesting the genericity of the\nproposed method.",

    "title": "Overcoming Language Priors in Visual Question Answering via  Distinguishing Superficially Similar Instances",
    "abstract": "Despite the great progress of Visual Question Answering (VQA), current VQA\nmodels heavily rely on the superficial correlation between the question type\nand its corresponding frequent answers (i.e., language priors) to make\npredictions, without really understanding the input. In this work, we define\nthe training instances with the same question type but different answers as\n\\textit{superficially similar instances}, and attribute the language priors to\nthe confusion of VQA model on such instances. To solve this problem, we propose\na novel training framework that explicitly encourages the VQA model to\ndistinguish between the superficially similar instances. Specifically, for each\ntraining instance, we first construct a set that contains its superficially\nsimilar counterparts. Then we exploit the proposed distinguishing module to\nincrease the distance between the instance and its counterparts in the answer\nspace. In this way, the VQA model is forced to further focus on the other parts\nof the input beyond the question type, which helps to overcome the language\npriors. Experimental results show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art\nperformance on VQA-CP v2.

The main novelties are a more\ninformed strategy for the sampling of motion proposals and a maximum coverage\nformulation for the proposal selection.

    "abstract": "This paper presents an efficient and safe method to avoid static and dynamic\nobstacles based on LiDAR. First, point cloud is used to generate a real-time\nlocal grid map for obstacle detection. Then, obstacles are clustered by DBSCAN\nalgorithm and enclosed with minimum bounding ellipses (MBEs). In addition, data\nassociation is conducted to match each MBE with the obstacle in the current\nframe. Considering MBE as an observation, Kalman filter (KF) is used to\nestimate and predict the motion state of the obstacle. In this way, the\ntrajectory of each obstacle in the forward time domain can be parameterized as\na set of ellipses. Due to the uncertainty of the MBE, the semi-major and\nsemi-minor axes of the parameterized ellipse are extended to ensure safety. We\nextend the traditional Control Barrier Function (CBF) and propose Dynamic\nControl Barrier Function (D-CBF). We combine D-CBF with Model Predictive\nControl (MPC) to implement safety-critical dynamic obstacle avoidance.\nExperiments in simulated and real scenarios are conducted to verify the\neffectiveness of our algorithm.

    "abstract": "A large body of work shows that machine learning (ML) models can leak\nsensitive or confidential information about their training data. Recently,\nleakage due to distribution inference (or property inference) attacks is\ngaining attention. In this attack, the goal of an adversary is to infer\ndistributional information about the training data. So far, research on\ndistribution inference has focused on demonstrating successful attacks, with\nlittle attention given to identifying the potential causes of the leakage and\nto proposing mitigations. To bridge this gap, as our main contribution, we\ntheoretically and empirically analyze the sources of information leakage that\nallows an adversary to perpetrate distribution inference attacks. We identify\nthree sources of leakage: (1) memorizing specific information about the\n$\\mathbb{E}[Y|X]$ (expected label given the feature values) of interest to the\nadversary, (2) wrong inductive bias of the model, and (3) finiteness of the\ntraining data. Next, based on our analysis, we propose principled mitigation\ntechniques against distribution inference attacks. Specifically, we demonstrate\nthat causal learning techniques are more resilient to a particular type of\ndistribution inference risk termed distributional membership inference than\nassociative learning methods. And lastly, we present a formalization of\ndistribution inference that allows for reasoning about more general adversaries\nthan was previously possible.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has shown promising performances on\nreconstructing 3D scenes and synthesizing novel views from a sparse set of 2D\nimages. Albeit effective, the performance of NeRF is highly influenced by the\nquality of training samples. With limited posed images from the scene, NeRF\nfails to generalize well to novel views and may collapse to trivial solutions\nin unobserved regions. This makes NeRF impractical under resource-constrained\nscenarios. In this paper, we present a novel learning framework, ActiveNeRF,\naiming to model a 3D scene with a constrained input budget. Specifically, we\nfirst incorporate uncertainty estimation into a NeRF model, which ensures\nrobustness under few observations and provides an interpretation of how NeRF\nunderstands the scene. On this basis, we propose to supplement the existing\ntraining set with newly captured samples based on an active learning scheme.

Lately, coresets (provable data summarizations) were leveraged\nfor pruning DNNs, adding the advantage of theoretical guarantees on the\ntrade-off between the compression rate and the approximation error. However,\ncoresets in this domain were either data-dependent or generated under\nrestrictive assumptions on both the model's weights and inputs.

    "abstract": "Recent efforts of multimodal Transformers have improved Visually Rich\nDocument Understanding (VrDU) tasks via incorporating visual and textual\ninformation. However, existing approaches mainly focus on fine-grained elements\nsuch as words and document image patches, making it hard for them to learn from\ncoarse-grained elements, including natural lexical units like phrases and\nsalient visual regions like prominent image regions. In this paper, we attach\nmore importance to coarse-grained elements containing high-density information\nand consistent semantics, which are valuable for document understanding. At\nfirst, a document graph is proposed to model complex relationships among\nmulti-grained multimodal elements, in which salient visual regions are detected\nby a cluster-based method. Then, a multi-grained multimodal Transformer called\nmmLayout is proposed to incorporate coarse-grained information into existing\npre-trained fine-grained multimodal Transformers based on the graph. In\nmmLayout, coarse-grained information is aggregated from fine-grained, and then,\nafter further processing, is fused back into fine-grained for final prediction.\nFurthermore, common sense enhancement is introduced to exploit the semantic\ninformation of natural lexical units. Experimental results on four tasks,\nincluding information extraction and document question answering, show that our\nmethod can improve the performance of multimodal Transformers based on\nfine-grained elements and achieve better performance with fewer parameters.\nQualitative analyses show that our method can capture consistent semantics in\ncoarse-grained elements.",

Mathematically, a composite\nformulation is developed to efficiently yield bumpless transition schemes with\nAC feasibility and stability both ensured.

    "abstract": "Nanopore sequencing is a widely-used high-throughput genome sequencing\ntechnology that can sequence long fragments of a genome into raw electrical\nsignals at low cost. Nanopore sequencing requires two computationally-costly\nprocessing steps for accurate downstream genome analysis. The first step,\nbasecalling, translates the raw electrical signals into nucleotide bases (i.e.,\nA, C, G, T). The second step, read mapping, finds the correct location of a\nread in a reference genome. In existing genome analysis pipelines, basecalling\nand read mapping are executed separately. We observe in this work that such\nseparate execution of the two most time-consuming steps inherently leads to (1)\nsignificant data movement and (2) redundant computations on the data, slowing\ndown the genome analysis pipeline. This paper proposes GenPIP, an in-memory\ngenome analysis accelerator that tightly integrates basecalling and read\nmapping. GenPIP improves the performance of the genome analysis pipeline with\ntwo key mechanisms: (1) in-memory fine-grained collaborative execution of the\nmajor genome analysis steps in parallel; (2) a new technique for\nearly-rejection of low-quality and unmapped reads to timely stop the execution\nof genome analysis for such reads, reducing inefficient computation. Our\nexperiments show that, for the execution of the genome analysis pipeline,\nGenPIP provides 41.6X (8.4X) speedup and 32.8X (20.8X) energy savings with\nnegligible accuracy loss compared to the state-of-the-art software genome\nanalysis tools executed on a state-of-the-art CPU (GPU).

We refute several prior non-quantitative hypotheses that\nover-simplify or over-estimate the influence of underlying causes, thereby\nfailing to capture the complex interplay between several factors. Our causal\nmodels also show a new connection between generalization and MI attacks via\ntheir shared causal factors. Our causal models have high predictive power\n($0.90$), i.e., their analytical predictions match with observations in unseen\nexperiments often, which makes analysis via them a pragmatic alternative.",

    "abstract": "Processing-in-memory (PIM), an increasingly studied neuromorphic hardware,\npromises orders of energy and throughput improvements for deep learning\ninference. Leveraging the massively parallel and efficient analog computing\ninside memories, PIM circumvents the bottlenecks of data movements in\nconventional digital hardware. However, an extra quantization step (i.e. PIM\nquantization), typically with limited resolution due to hardware constraints,\nis required to convert the analog computing results into digital domain.\nMeanwhile, non-ideal effects extensively exist in PIM quantization because of\nthe imperfect analog-to-digital interface, which further compromises the\ninference accuracy.\nIn this paper, we propose a method for training quantized networks to\nincorporate PIM quantization, which is ubiquitous to all PIM systems.\nSpecifically, we propose a PIM quantization aware training (PIM-QAT) algorithm,\nand introduce rescaling techniques during backward and forward propagation by\nanalyzing the training dynamics to facilitate training convergence. We also\npropose two techniques, namely batch normalization (BN) calibration and\nadjusted precision training, to suppress the adverse effects of non-ideal\nlinearity and stochastic thermal noise involved in real PIM chips. Our method\nis validated on three mainstream PIM decomposition schemes, and physically on a\nprototype chip. Comparing with directly deploying conventionally trained\nquantized model on PIM systems, which does not take into account this extra\nquantization step and thus fails, our method provides significant improvement.\nIt also achieves comparable inference accuracy on PIM systems as that of\nconventionally quantized models on digital hardware, across CIFAR10 and\nCIFAR100 datasets using various network depths for the most popular network\ntopology.",

Our proposed manifold graph metrics (MGMs) provide insights into\nthe geometric similarities and differences between available SSL models, their\ninvariances with respect to specific augmentations, and their performances on\ntransfer learning tasks. Our key findings are two fold: (i) contrary to popular\nbelief, the geometry of SSL models is not tied to its training paradigm\n(contrastive, non-contrastive, and cluster-based); (ii) we can predict the\ntransfer learning capability for a specific model based on the geometric\nproperties of its semantic and augmentation manifolds.",

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become an essential component in many\napplication domains including web-based services. A variety of these services\nrequire high throughput and (close to) real-time features, for instance, to\nrespond or react to users' requests or to process a stream of incoming data on\ntime. However, the trend in DNN design is toward larger models with many layers\nand parameters to achieve more accurate results. Although these models are\noften pre-trained, the computational complexity in such large models can still\nbe relatively significant, hindering low inference latency. Implementing a\ncaching mechanism is a typical systems engineering solution for speeding up a\nservice response time. However, traditional caching is often not suitable for\nDNN-based services. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end automated solution\nto improve the performance of DNN-based services in terms of their\ncomputational complexity and inference latency. Our caching method adopts the\nideas of self-distillation of DNN models and early exits. The proposed solution\nis an automated online layer caching mechanism that allows early exiting of a\nlarge model during inference time if the cache model in one of the early exits\nis confident enough for final prediction. One of the main contributions of this\npaper is that we have implemented the idea as an online caching, meaning that\nthe cache models do not need access to training data and perform solely based\non the incoming data at run-time, making it suitable for applications using\npre-trained models. Our experiments results on two downstream tasks (face and\nobject classification) show that, on average, caching can reduce the\ncomputational complexity of those services up to 58\\% (in terms of FLOPs count)\nand improve their inference latency up to 46\\% with low to zero reduction in\naccuracy.",

    "abstract": "Population protocols are a relatively novel computational model in which very\nresource-limited anonymous agents interact in pairs with the goal of computing\npredicates. We consider the probabilistic version of this model, which\nnaturally allows to consider the setup in which a small probability of an\nincorrect output is tolerated. The main focus of this thesis is the question of\nconfident leader election, which is an extension of the regular leader election\nproblem with an extra requirement for the eventual leader to detect its\nuniqueness. Having a confident leader allows the population protocols to\ndetermine the convergence of its computations. This behaviour of the model is\nhighly beneficial and was shown to be feasible when the original model is\nextended in various ways.\nWe show that it takes a linear in terms of the population size number of\ninteractions for a probabilistic population protocol to have a non-zero\nfraction of agents in all reachable states, starting from a configuration with\nall agents in the same state. This leads us to a conclusion that confident\nleader election is out of reach even with the probabilistic version of the\nmodel.",

    "abstract": "Replay methods have shown to be successful in mitigating catastrophic\nforgetting in continual learning scenarios despite having limited access to\nhistorical data. However, storing historical data is cheap in many real-world\napplications, yet replaying all historical data would be prohibited due to\nprocessing time constraints. In such settings, we propose learning the time to\nlearn for a continual learning system, in which we learn replay schedules over\nwhich tasks to replay at different time steps. To demonstrate the importance of\nlearning the time to learn, we first use Monte Carlo tree search to find the\nproper replay schedule and show that it can outperform fixed scheduling\npolicies in terms of continual learning performance. Moreover, to improve the\nscheduling efficiency itself, we propose to use reinforcement learning to learn\nthe replay scheduling policies that can generalize to new continual learning\nscenarios without added computational cost. In our experiments, we show the\nadvantages of learning the time to learn, which brings current continual\nlearning research closer to real-world needs.",

These tasks are fundamentally difficult, and\nrequire combining evidence from multiple different aspects (what we term\n\"attributes\"). In these applications, the number of applicants is often large,\nand a common practice is to assign the task to multiple evaluators in a\ndistributed fashion. Specifically, in the often-used holistic allocation, each\nevaluator is assigned a subset of the applicants, and is asked to assess all\nrelevant information for their assigned applicants. However, such an evaluation\nprocess is subject to issues such as miscalibration (evaluators see only a\nsmall fraction of the applicants and may not get a good sense of relative\nquality), and discrimination (evaluators are influenced by irrelevant\ninformation about the applicants). We identify that such attribute-based\nevaluation allows alternative allocation schemes.

We compare segmented allocation to holistic\nallocation on several dimensions via theoretical and experimental methods.

As\na result, these wallets are light-weight and high-performant, but come with\nsecurity risks. A malicious provider can completely mislead the wallet, e.g.,\nfake payments and balances, or censor transactions. On the other hand, light\nclients, which are not in popular use today, allow decentralization, but at\ninefficient linear bootstrapping complexity. This poses a dilemma between\ndecentralization and performance. In this paper, we design, implement, and\nevaluate a new proof-of-stake (PoS) superlight client with logarithmic\nbootstrapping complexity. Our key insight is to leverage the standard\nexistential honesty assumption, i.e., that the verifier (client) is connected\nto at least one honest prover (full node). The proofs of PoS take the form of a\nMerkle tree of PoS epochs. The verifier enrolls the provers in a bisection\ngame, in which the honest prover is destined to win once an adversarial Merkle\ntree is challenged at sufficient depth. We implement a complete client that is\ncompatible with mainnet PoS Ethereum to evaluate our construction: compared to\nthe current light client construction proposed for PoS Ethereum, our client\nimproves time-to-completion by 9x, communication by 180x, and energy usage by\n30x.

    "abstract": "Off-policy Evaluation (OPE) methods are crucial tools for evaluating policies\nin high-stakes domains such as healthcare, where direct deployment is often\ninfeasible, unethical, or expensive. When deployment environments are expected\nto undergo changes (that is, dataset shifts), it is important for OPE methods\nto perform robust evaluation of the policies amidst such changes. Existing\napproaches consider robustness against a large class of shifts that can\narbitrarily change any observable property of the environment. This often\nresults in highly pessimistic estimates of the utilities, thereby invalidating\npolicies that might have been useful in deployment. In this work, we address\nthe aforementioned problem by investigating how domain knowledge can help\nprovide more realistic estimates of the utilities of policies. We leverage\nhuman inputs on which aspects of the environments may plausibly change, and\nadapt the OPE methods to only consider shifts on these aspects. Specifically,\nwe propose a novel framework, Robust OPE (ROPE), which considers shifts on a\nsubset of covariates in the data based on user inputs, and estimates worst-case\nutility under these shifts. We then develop computationally efficient\nalgorithms for OPE that are robust to the aforementioned shifts for contextual\nbandits and Markov decision processes. We also theoretically analyze the sample\ncomplexity of these algorithms. Extensive experimentation with synthetic and\nreal world datasets from the healthcare domain demonstrates that our approach\nnot only captures realistic dataset shifts accurately, but also results in less\npessimistic policy evaluations.",

    "title": "A Hybrid Cable-Driven Robot for Non-Destructive Leafy Plant Monitoring  and Mass Estimation using Structure from Motion",
    "abstract": "We propose a novel hybrid cable-based robot with manipulator and camera for\nhigh-accuracy, medium-throughput plant monitoring in a vertical hydroponic farm\nand, as an example application, demonstrate non-destructive plant mass\nestimation. Plant monitoring with high temporal and spatial resolution is\nimportant to both farmers and researchers to detect anomalies and develop\npredictive models for plant growth. The availability of high-quality,\noff-the-shelf structure-from-motion (SfM) and photogrammetry packages has\nenabled a vibrant community of roboticists to apply computer vision for\nnon-destructive plant monitoring. While existing approaches tend to focus on\neither high-throughput (e.g. satellite, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV),\nvehicle-mounted, conveyor-belt imagery) or high-accuracy/robustness to\nocclusions (e.g. turn-table scanner or robot arm), we propose a middle-ground\nthat achieves high accuracy with a medium-throughput, highly automated robot.\nOur design pairs the workspace scalability of a cable-driven parallel robot\n(CDPR) with the dexterity of a 4 degree-of-freedom (DoF) robot arm to\nautonomously image many plants from a variety of viewpoints. We describe our\nrobot design and demonstrate it experimentally by collecting daily photographs\nof 54 plants from 64 viewpoints each. We show that our approach can produce\nscientifically useful measurements, operate fully autonomously after initial\ncalibration, and produce better reconstructions and plant property estimates\nthan those of over-canopy methods (e.g. UAV). As example applications, we show\nthat our system can successfully estimate plant mass with a Mean Absolute Error\n(MAE) of 0.586g and, when used to perform hypothesis testing on the\nrelationship between mass and age, produces p-values comparable to ground-truth\ndata (p=0.0020 and p=0.0016, respectively).",

    "abstract": "Wearable cameras allow to acquire images and videos from the user's\nperspective. These data can be processed to understand humans behavior. Despite\nhuman behavior analysis has been thoroughly investigated in third person\nvision, it is still understudied in egocentric settings and in particular in\nindustrial scenarios. To encourage research in this field, we present MECCANO,\na multimodal dataset of egocentric videos to study humans behavior\nunderstanding in industrial-like settings. The multimodality is characterized\nby the presence of gaze signals, depth maps and RGB videos acquired\nsimultaneously with a custom headset. The dataset has been explicitly labeled\nfor fundamental tasks in the context of human behavior understanding from a\nfirst person view, such as recognizing and anticipating human-object\ninteractions. With the MECCANO dataset, we explored five different tasks\nincluding 1) Action Recognition, 2) Active Objects Detection and Recognition,\n3) Egocentric Human-Objects Interaction Detection, 4) Action Anticipation and\n5) Next-Active Objects Detection. We propose a benchmark aimed to study human\nbehavior in the considered industrial-like scenario which demonstrates that the\ninvestigated tasks and the considered scenario are challenging for\nstate-of-the-art algorithms.

    "abstract": "While online social media offers a way for ignored or stifled voices to be\nheard, it also allows users a platform to spread hateful speech. Such speech\nusually originates in fringe communities, yet it can spill over into mainstream\nchannels. In this paper, we measure the impact of joining fringe hateful\ncommunities in terms of hate speech propagated to the rest of the social\nnetwork. We leverage data from Reddit to assess the effect of joining one type\nof echo chamber: a digital community of like-minded users exhibiting hateful\nbehavior. We measure members' usage of hate speech outside the studied\ncommunity before and after they become active participants. Using Interrupted\nTime Series (ITS) analysis as a causal inference method, we gauge the spillover\neffect, in which hateful language from within a certain community can spread\noutside that community by using the level of out-of-community hate word usage\nas a proxy for learned hate. We investigate four different Reddit\nsub-communities (subreddits) covering three areas of hate speech: racism,\nmisogyny and fat-shaming. In all three cases we find an increase in hate speech\noutside the originating community, implying that joining such community leads\nto a spread of hate speech throughout the platform. Moreover, users are found\nto pick up this new hateful speech for months after initially joining the\ncommunity. We show that the harmful speech does not remain contained within the\ncommunity. Our results provide new evidence of the harmful effects of echo\nchambers and the potential benefit of moderating them to reduce adoption of\nhateful speech.",

    "abstract": "Today mobile users such as drivers are invited by content providers (e.g.,\nTripadvisor) to sample fresh information of diverse paths to control the age of\ninformation (AoI). However, selfish drivers prefer to travel through the\nshortest path instead of the others with extra costs in time and gas. To\nmotivate drivers to route and sample diverse paths, this paper is the first to\npropose online pricing for a provider to economically reward drivers for\ndiverse routing and control the actual AoI dynamics over time and spatial path\ndomains. This online pricing optimization problem should be solved without\nknowing drivers' costs and even arrivals, and is intractable due to the curse\nof dimensionality in both time and space. If there is only one non-shortest\npath, we leverage the Markov decision process (MDP) techniques to analyze the\nproblem. Accordingly, we design a linear-time algorithm for returning optimal\nonline pricing, where a higher pricing reward is needed for a larger AoI. If\nthere are a number of non-shortest paths, we prove that pricing one path at a\ntime is optimal, yet it is not optimal to choose the path with the largest\ncurrent AoI. Then we propose a new backward-clustered computation method and\ndevelop an approximation algorithm to alternate different paths to price over\ntime. Perhaps surprisingly, our analysis of approximation ratio suggests that\nour algorithm's performance approaches closer to optimum given more paths.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are well known to be vulnerable to adversarial\nexamples (AEs). In addition, AEs have adversarial transferability, which means\nAEs generated for a source model can fool another black-box model (target\nmodel) with a non-trivial probability. In this paper, we investigate the\nproperty of adversarial transferability between models including ConvMixer,\nwhich is an isotropic network, for the first time. To objectively verify the\nproperty of transferability, the robustness of models is evaluated by using a\nbenchmark attack method called AutoAttack. In an image classification\nexperiment, ConvMixer is confirmed to be weak to adversarial transferability.",

    "abstract": "We study the complexity of classical constraint satisfaction problems on a 2D\ngrid. Specifically, we consider the complexity of function versions of such\nproblems, with the additional restriction that the constraints are\ntranslationally invariant, namely, the variables are located at the vertices of\na 2D grid and the constraint between every pair of adjacent variables is the\nsame in each dimension. The only input to the problem is thus the size of the\ngrid. This problem is equivalent to one of the most interesting problems in\nclassical physics, namely, computing the lowest energy of a classical system of\nparticles on the grid. We provide a tight characterization of the complexity of\nthis problem, and show that it is complete for the class $FP^{NEXP}$. Gottesman\nand Irani (FOCS 2009) also studied classical translationally-invariant\nconstraint satisfaction problems; they show that the problem of deciding\nwhether the cost of the optimal solution is below a given threshold is\nNEXP-complete. Our result is thus a strengthening of their result from the\ndecision version to the function version of the problem. Our result can also be\nviewed as a generalization to the translationally invariant setting, of\nKrentel's famous result from 1988, showing that the function version of SAT is\ncomplete for the class $FP^{NP}$. An essential ingredient in the proof is a\nstudy of the complexity of a gapped variant of the problem. We show that it is\nNEXP-hard to approximate the cost of the optimal assignment to within an\nadditive error of $\\Omega(N^{1/4})$, for an $N \\times N$ grid. To the best of\nour knowledge, no gapped result is known for CSPs on the grid, even in the\nnon-translationally invariant case. As a byproduct of our results, we also show\nthat a decision version of the optimization problem which asks whether the cost\nof the optimal assignment is odd or even is also complete for $P^{NEXP}$.",

This paper proposes a new fusion framework for predicting the\nincident duration from limited information by using an integration of machine\nlearning with traffic flow/speed and incident description as features, encoded\nvia several Deep Learning methods (ANN autoencoder and character-level LSTM-ANN\nsentiment classifier). The paper constructs a cross-disciplinary modelling\napproach in transport and data science. The approach improves the incident\nduration prediction accuracy over the top-performing ML models applied to\nbaseline incident reports. Results show that our proposed method can improve\nthe accuracy by $60\\%$ when compared to standard linear or support vector\nregression models, and a further $7\\%$ improvement with respect to the hybrid\ndeep learning auto-encoded GBDT model which seems to outperform all other\nmodels.

The latent prior model can be gradually learned\nusing ratio estimated in previous stage so that the final latent space EBM\nprior can be naturally formed by product of ratios in different stages.

    "abstract": "Remarkable progress has been made in self-supervised monocular depth\nestimation (SS-MDE) by exploring cross-view consistency, e.g., photometric\nconsistency and 3D point cloud consistency. However, they are very vulnerable\nto illumination variance, occlusions, texture-less regions, as well as moving\nobjects, making them not robust enough to deal with various scenes. To address\nthis challenge, we study two kinds of robust cross-view consistency in this\npaper. Firstly, the spatial offset field between adjacent frames is obtained by\nreconstructing the reference frame from its neighbors via deformable alignment,\nwhich is used to align the temporal depth features via a Depth Feature\nAlignment (DFA) loss. Secondly, the 3D point clouds of each reference frame and\nits nearby frames are calculated and transformed into voxel space, where the\npoint density in each voxel is calculated and aligned via a Voxel Density\nAlignment (VDA) loss. In this way, we exploit the temporal coherence in both\ndepth feature space and 3D voxel space for SS-MDE, shifting the\n\"point-to-point\" alignment paradigm to the \"region-to-region\" one. Compared\nwith the photometric consistency loss as well as the rigid point cloud\nalignment loss, the proposed DFA and VDA losses are more robust owing to the\nstrong representation power of deep features as well as the high tolerance of\nvoxel density to the aforementioned challenges. Experimental results on several\noutdoor benchmarks show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art\ntechniques. Extensive ablation study and analysis validate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed losses, especially in challenging scenes.

    "abstract": "Analogical Reasoning problems challenge both connectionist and symbolic AI\nsystems as these entail a combination of background knowledge, reasoning and\npattern recognition. While symbolic systems ingest explicit domain knowledge\nand perform deductive reasoning, they are sensitive to noise and require inputs\nbe mapped to preset symbolic features. Connectionist systems on the other hand\ncan directly ingest rich input spaces such as images, text or speech and\nrecognize pattern even with noisy inputs. However, connectionist models\nstruggle to include explicit domain knowledge for deductive reasoning. In this\npaper, we propose a framework that combines the pattern recognition abilities\nof neural networks with symbolic reasoning and background knowledge for solving\na class of Analogical Reasoning problems where the set of attributes and\npossible relations across them are known apriori. We take inspiration from the\n'neural algorithmic reasoning' approach [DeepMind 2020] and use\nproblem-specific background knowledge by (i) learning a distributed\nrepresentation based on a symbolic model of the problem (ii) training\nneural-network transformations reflective of the relations involved in the\nproblem and finally (iii) training a neural network encoder from images to the\ndistributed representation in (i). These three elements enable us to perform\nsearch-based reasoning using neural networks as elementary functions\nmanipulating distributed representations. We test this on visual analogy\nproblems in RAVENs Progressive Matrices, and achieve accuracy competitive with\nhuman performance and, in certain cases, superior to initial end-to-end\nneural-network based approaches. While recent neural models trained at scale\nyield SOTA, our novel neuro-symbolic reasoning approach is a promising\ndirection for this problem, and is arguably more general, especially for\nproblems where domain knowledge is available.",

Such features naturally\narise in merchandised recommendation systems; for instance, \"user clicked this\nitem\" as a feature is predictive of \"user purchased this item\" in the offline\ndata, but is clearly not available during online serving. Another source of\nprivileged features is those that are too expensive to compute online but\nfeasible to be added offline. Privileged features distillation (PFD) refers to\na natural idea: train a \"teacher\" model using all features (including\nprivileged ones) and then use it to train a \"student\" model that does not use\nthe privileged features.\nIn this paper, we first study PFD empirically on three public ranking\ndatasets and an industrial-scale ranking problem derived from Amazon's logs. We\nshow that PFD outperforms several baselines (no-distillation,\npretraining-finetuning, self-distillation, and generalized distillation) on all\nthese datasets. Next, we analyze why and when PFD performs well via both\nempirical ablation studies and theoretical analysis for linear models. Both\ninvestigations uncover an interesting non-monotone behavior: as the predictive\npower of a privileged feature increases, the performance of the resulting\nstudent model initially increases but then decreases. We show the reason for\nthe later decreasing performance is that a very predictive privileged teacher\nproduces predictions with high variance, which lead to high variance student\nestimates and inferior testing performance.",

    "abstract": "The advancement of the communication technology and the popularity of the\nsmart phones foster the booming of video ads. Baidu, as one of the leading\nsearch engine companies in the world, receives billions of search queries per\nday. How to pair the video ads with the user search is the core task of Baidu\nvideo advertising. Due to the modality gap, the query-to-video retrieval is\nmuch more challenging than traditional query-to-document retrieval and\nimage-to-image search. Traditionally, the query-to-video retrieval is tackled\nby the query-to-title retrieval, which is not reliable when the quality of\ntiles are not high. With the rapid progress achieved in computer vision and\nnatural language processing in recent years, content-based search methods\nbecomes promising for the query-to-video retrieval. Benefited from pretraining\non large-scale datasets, some visionBERT methods based on cross-modal attention\nhave achieved excellent performance in many vision-language tasks not only in\nacademia but also in industry. Nevertheless, the expensive computation cost of\ncross-modal attention makes it impractical for large-scale search in industrial\napplications. In this work, we present a tree-based combo-attention network\n(TCAN) which has been recently launched in Baidu's dynamic video advertising\nplatform. It provides a practical solution to deploy the heavy cross-modal\nattention for the large-scale query-to-video search. After launching tree-based\ncombo-attention network, click-through rate gets improved by 2.29\\% and\nconversion rate get improved by 2.63\\%.",

Popular models for rate-independent dissipation are hysteresis models;\nand a highly popular hysteresis model is the Bouc-Wen model. If such hysteretic\ndissipation is incorporated in a refined finite element model, then the\nmathematical model includes the usual structural dynamics equations along with\nnonlinear nonsmooth ordinary differential equations for a large number of\ninternal hysteretic states at Gauss points, to be used within the virtual work\ncalculation for dissipation. For such systems, numerical integration becomes\ndifficult due to both the distributed non-analytic nonlinearity of hysteresis\nas well as the very high natural frequencies in the finite element model. Here\nwe offer two contributions. First, we present a simple semi-implicit\nintegration approach where the structural part is handled implicitly based on\nthe work of Pich\\'e, and where the hysteretic part is handled explicitly. A\ncantilever beam example is solved in detail using high mesh refinement.\nConvergence is good for lower damping and a smoother hysteresis loop. For a\nless smooth hysteresis loop and/or higher damping, convergence is observed to\nbe roughly linear on average. Encouragingly, the time step needed for stability\nis much larger than the time period of the highest natural frequency of the\nstructural model. Subsequently, data from several simulations conducted using\nthe above semi-implicit method are used to construct reduced order models of\nthe system, where the structural dynamics is projected onto a small number of\nmodes and the number of hysteretic states is reduced significantly as well.\nConvergence studies of error against the number of retained hysteretic states\nshow very good results.",

    "abstract": "Two-view knowledge graphs (KGs) jointly represent two components: an ontology\nview for abstract and commonsense concepts, and an instance view for specific\nentities that are instantiated from ontological concepts. As such, these KGs\ncontain heterogeneous structures that are hierarchical, from the ontology-view,\nand cyclical, from the instance-view. Despite these various structures in KGs,\nmost recent works on embedding KGs assume that the entire KG belongs to only\none of the two views but not both simultaneously. For works that seek to put\nboth views of the KG together, the instance and ontology views are assumed to\nbelong to the same geometric space, such as all nodes embedded in the same\nEuclidean space or non-Euclidean product space, an assumption no longer\nreasonable for two-view KGs where different portions of the graph exhibit\ndifferent structures. To address this issue, we define and construct a\ndual-geometric space embedding model (DGS) that models two-view KGs using a\ncomplex non-Euclidean geometric space, by embedding different portions of the\nKG in different geometric spaces. DGS utilizes the spherical space, hyperbolic\nspace, and their intersecting space in a unified framework for learning\nembeddings. Furthermore, for the spherical space, we propose novel closed\nspherical space operators that directly operate in the spherical space without\nthe need for mapping to an approximate tangent space. Experiments on public\ndatasets show that DGS significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art\nbaseline models on KG completion tasks, demonstrating its ability to better\nmodel heterogeneous structures in KGs.",

But, the lack of adequate\nannotated data and the high spatiospectral dimensions of HSIs usually make\nclassification networks prone to overfit. Thus, learning a general\nrepresentation which can be transferred to the downstream tasks is imperative.\nTo our knowledge, no appropriate self-supervised pre-training method has been\ndesigned for histopathology HSIs. In this paper, we introduce an efficient and\neffective Self-supervised Spectral Regression (S$^3$R) method, which exploits\nthe low rank characteristic in the spectral domain of HSI. More concretely, we\npropose to learn a set of linear coefficients that can be used to represent one\nband by the remaining bands via masking out these bands. Then, the band is\nrestored by using the learned coefficients to reweight the remaining bands. Two\npre-text tasks are designed: (1)S$^3$R-CR, which regresses the linear\ncoefficients, so that the pre-trained model understands the inherent structures\nof HSIs and the pathological characteristics of different morphologies;\n(2)S$^3$R-BR, which regresses the missing band, making the model to learn the\nholistic semantics of HSIs.

In order to protect the IP of text\ngeneration APIs, a recent work has introduced a watermarking algorithm and\nutilized the null-hypothesis test as a post-hoc ownership verification on the\nimitation models. However, we find that it is possible to detect those\nwatermarks via sufficient statistics of the frequencies of candidate\nwatermarking words. To address this drawback, in this paper, we propose a novel\nConditional wATERmarking framework (CATER) for protecting the IP of text\ngeneration APIs. An optimization method is proposed to decide the watermarking\nrules that can minimize the distortion of overall word distributions while\nmaximizing the change of conditional word selections. Theoretically, we prove\nthat it is infeasible for even the savviest attacker (they know how CATER\nworks) to reveal the used watermarks from a large pool of potential word pairs\nbased on statistical inspection. Empirically, we observe that high-order\nconditions lead to an exponential growth of suspicious (unused) watermarks,\nmaking our crafted watermarks more stealthy. In addition, \\cater can\neffectively identify the IP infringement under architectural mismatch and\ncross-domain imitation attacks, with negligible impairments on the generation\nquality of victim APIs.

The\nself-supervised object segmentation framework can be applied to various NeRF\nmodels that both lead to photo-realistic rendering results and convincing\nsegmentations for both indoor and outdoor scenarios.

    "abstract": "Human face images usually appear with wide range of visual scales. The\nexisting face representations pursue the bandwidth of handling scale variation\nvia multi-scale scheme that assembles a finite series of predefined scales.\nSuch multi-shot scheme brings inference burden, and the predefined scales\ninevitably have gap from real data. Instead, learning scale parameters from\ndata, and using them for one-shot feature inference, is a decent solution. To\nthis end, we reform the conv layer by resorting to the scale-space theory, and\nachieve two-fold facilities: 1) the conv layer learns a set of scales from real\ndata distribution, each of which is fulfilled by a conv kernel; 2) the layer\nautomatically highlights the feature at the proper channel and location\ncorresponding to the input pattern scale and its presence. Then, we accomplish\nthe hierarchical scale attention by stacking the reformed layers, building a\nnovel style named SCale AttentioN Conv Neural Network (\\textbf{SCAN-CNN}). We\napply SCAN-CNN to the face recognition task and push the frontier of SOTA\nperformance. The accuracy gain is more evident when the face images are blurry.\nMeanwhile, as a single-shot scheme, the inference is more efficient than\nmulti-shot fusion. A set of tools are made to ensure the fast training of\nSCAN-CNN and zero increase of inference cost compared with the plain CNN.",

    "abstract": "3D human pose estimation from a monocular video has recently seen significant\nimprovements. However, most state-of-the-art methods are kinematics-based,\nwhich are prone to physically implausible motions with pronounced artifacts.\nCurrent dynamics-based methods can predict physically plausible motion but are\nrestricted to simple scenarios with static camera view. In this work, we\npresent D&D (Learning Human Dynamics from Dynamic Camera), which leverages the\nlaws of physics to reconstruct 3D human motion from the in-the-wild videos with\na moving camera. D&D introduces inertial force control (IFC) to explain the 3D\nhuman motion in the non-inertial local frame by considering the inertial forces\nof the dynamic camera. To learn the ground contact with limited annotations, we\ndevelop probabilistic contact torque (PCT), which is computed by differentiable\nsampling from contact probabilities and used to generate motions. The contact\nstate can be weakly supervised by encouraging the model to generate correct\nmotions. Furthermore, we propose an attentive PD controller that adjusts target\npose states using temporal information to obtain smooth and accurate pose\ncontrol. Our approach is entirely neural-based and runs without offline\noptimization or simulation in physics engines. Experiments on large-scale 3D\nhuman motion benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of D&D, where we exhibit\nsuperior performance against both state-of-the-art kinematics-based and\ndynamics-based methods.

These observations\nmotivate us to analyze how differently people with and without adequate drawing\nskills sketch 3D objects. We invited 70 novice users and 38 expert users to\nsketch 136 3D objects, which were presented as 362 images rendered from\nmultiple views.

    "abstract": "As social media becomes a hotbed for the spread of misinformation, the\ncrucial task of rumor detection has witnessed promising advances fostered by\nopen-source benchmark datasets. Despite being widely used, we find that these\ndatasets suffer from spurious correlations, which are ignored by existing\nstudies and lead to severe overestimation of existing rumor detection\nperformance. The spurious correlations stem from three causes: (1) event-based\ndata collection and labeling schemes assign the same veracity label to multiple\nhighly similar posts from the same underlying event; (2) merging multiple data\nsources spuriously relates source identities to veracity labels; and (3)\nlabeling bias. In this paper, we closely investigate three of the most popular\nrumor detection benchmark datasets (i.e., Twitter15, Twitter16 and PHEME), and\npropose event-separated rumor detection as a solution to eliminate spurious\ncues. Under the event-separated setting, we observe that the accuracy of\nexisting state-of-the-art models drops significantly by over 40%, becoming only\ncomparable to a simple neural classifier. To better address this task, we\npropose Publisher Style Aggregation (PSA), a generalizable approach that\naggregates publisher posting records to learn writing style and veracity\nstance.

Furthermore, as an effective joint optimization mechanism,\nbundle adjustment (BA) cannot be directly introduced into real-time odometry\ndue to the intensive computation of large-scale global landmarks. Therefore,\nthis letter designs a new strategy named a landmark map for bundle adjustment\nodometry (LMBAO) in LiDAR SLAM to solve these problems. First, BA-based\nodometry is further developed with an active landmark maintenance strategy for\na more accurate local registration and avoiding cumulative errors.\nSpecifically, this paper keeps entire stable landmarks on the map instead of\njust their feature points in the sliding window and deletes the landmarks\naccording to their active grade. Next, the sliding window length is reduced,\nand marginalization is performed to retain the scans outside the window but\ncorresponding to active landmarks on the map, greatly simplifying the\ncomputation and improving the real-time properties.

    "abstract": "Modern-day surveillance systems perform person recognition using deep\nlearning-based face verification networks. Most state-of-the-art facial\nverification systems are trained using visible spectrum images. But, acquiring\nimages in the visible spectrum is impractical in scenarios of low-light and\nnighttime conditions, and often images are captured in an alternate domain such\nas the thermal infrared domain. Facial verification in thermal images is often\nperformed after retrieving the corresponding visible domain images. This is a\nwell-established problem often known as the Thermal-to-Visible (T2V) image\ntranslation. In this paper, we propose a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic\nModel (DDPM) based solution for T2V translation specifically for facial images.\nDuring training, the model learns the conditional distribution of visible\nfacial images given their corresponding thermal image through the diffusion\nprocess. During inference, the visible domain image is obtained by starting\nfrom Gaussian noise and performing denoising repeatedly. The existing inference\nprocess for DDPMs is stochastic and time-consuming. Hence, we propose a novel\ninference strategy for speeding up the inference time of DDPMs, specifically\nfor the problem of T2V image translation.

    "abstract": "Security Hardening is the process of configuring IT systems to ensure the\nsecurity of the systems' components and data they process or store. In many\ncases, so-called security-configuration guides are used as a basis for security\nhardening. These guides describe secure configuration settings for components\nsuch as operating systems and standard applications. Rigorous testing of\nsecurity-configuration guides and automated mechanisms for their implementation\nand validation are necessary since erroneous implementations or checks of\nhardening guides may severely impact systems' security and functionality. At\nSiemens, centrally maintained security-configuration guides carry\nmachine-readable information specifying both the implementation and validation\nof each required configuration step. The guides are maintained within git\nrepositories; automated pipelines generate the artifacts for implementation and\nchecking, e.g., PowerShell scripts for Windows, and carry out testing of these\nartifacts on AWS images. This paper describes our experiences with our\nDevOps-inspired approach for authoring, maintaining, and testing\nsecurity-configuration guides. We want to share these experiences to help other\norganizations with their security hardening and, thus, increase their systems'\nsecurity.",

    "abstract": "After power is switched on, recovering the interrupted program from the\ninitial state can cause negative impact. Some programs are even unrecoverable.\nTo rapid recovery of program execution under power failures, the execution\nstates of checkpoints are backed up by NVM under power failures for embedded\nsystems with NVM. However, frequent checkpoints will shorten the lifetime of\nthe NVM and incur significant write overhead. In this paper, the technique of\ncheckpoint setting triggered by function calls is proposed to reduce the write\non NVM. The evaluation results show an average of 99.8% and 80.5$% reduction on\nNVM backup size for stack backup, compared to the log-based method and\nstep-based method. In order to better achieve this, we also propose\npseudo-function calls to increase backup points to reduce recovery costs, and\nexponential incremental call-based backup methods to reduce backup costs in the\nloop. To further avoid the content on NVM is cluttered and out of NVM, a method\nto clean the contents on the NVM that are useless for restoration is proposed.\nBased on aforementioned problems and techniques, the recovery technology is\nproposed, and the case is used to analyze how to recover rapidly under\ndifferent power failures.",

Our study shows that models trained only with\nlimited in-domain data surpass publicly available systems by a significant\nmargin, and a subsequent human evaluation reveals interesting findings in the\nfinal translation. The first part of the article introduces some of the\nchallenges of video game translation, some of the existing literature, as well\nas the systems and data sets used in this experiment. The last sections discuss\nour analysis of the resulting translation and the potential benefits of such an\nautomated system. One such finding highlights the model's ability to learn\ntypical rules and patterns of video game translations from English into French.\nOur conclusions therefore indicate that the specific case of video game machine\ntranslation could prove very much useful given the encouraging results, the\nhighly repetitive nature of the work, and the often poor working conditions\nthat translators face in this field.

The trend\nto reduced filter capacitors and even dynamically reconfigurable batteries\nfurther increases the ripple. The influence of rippled load on lithium\nbatteries is therefore receiving increased attention. According to recent\nstudies, accelerated ageing strongly depends on the frequency of the ripple. We\nuse electrochemical models to derive a highly simplified regression model that\ncatches the asymptotic behavior and allows parameter identification and\ncalibration to specific cells.

As\nconsequence of this, and due to the conservative nature of the problem, we\nadopt a finite volume elements discretization approach over a generic\nnon-uniform mesh. We focus on grids mapped by a smooth function which consist\nin a combination of a graded mesh near the singularity and a uniform mesh where\nthe solution is smooth. Such a choice gives rise to Toeplitz-like\ndiscretization matrices and thus allows a low computational cost of the\nmatrix-vector product and a detailed spectral analysis. The obtained spectral\ninformation is used to develop an ad-hoc parameter free multigrid\npreconditioner for GMRES, which is numerically shown to yield good convergence\nresults in presence of graded meshes mapped by power functions that accumulate\npoints near the singularity. The approximation order of the considered graded\nmeshes is numerically compared with the one of a certain composite mesh given\nin literature that still leads to Toeplitz-like linear systems and is then\nstill well-suited for our multigrid method. Several numerical tests confirm\nthat power graded meshes result in lower approximation errors than composite\nones and that our solver has a wide range of applicability.",

To make efficient divergence estimation, a k-nearest neighbor\nestimator is utilized with a randomly-initialized state encoder. Finally, the\nREVD is tested on PyBullet Robotics Environments and Atari games.

    "abstract": "Bundle Adjustment (BA) refers to the problem of simultaneous determination of\nsensor poses and scene geometry, which is a fundamental problem in robot\nvision. This paper presents an efficient and consistent bundle adjustment\nmethod for lidar sensors. The method employs edge and plane features to\nrepresent the scene geometry, and directly minimizes the natural Euclidean\ndistance from each raw point to the respective geometry feature. A nice\nproperty of this formulation is that the geometry features can be analytically\nsolved, drastically reducing the dimension of the numerical optimization. To\nrepresent and solve the resultant optimization problem more efficiently, this\npaper then proposes a novel concept {\\it point clusters}, which encodes all raw\npoints associated to the same feature by a compact set of parameters, the {\\it\npoint cluster coordinates}. We derive the closed-form derivatives, up to the\nsecond order, of the BA optimization based on the point cluster coordinates and\nshow their theoretical properties such as the null spaces and sparsity. Based\non these theoretical results, this paper develops an efficient second-order BA\nsolver. Besides estimating the lidar poses, the solver also exploits the second\norder information to estimate the pose uncertainty caused by measurement\nnoises, leading to consistent estimates of lidar poses. Moreover, thanks to the\nuse of point cluster, the developed solver fundamentally avoids the enumeration\nof each raw point (which is very time-consuming due to the large number) in all\nsteps of the optimization: cost evaluation, derivatives evaluation and\nuncertainty evaluation. The implementation of our method is open sourced to\nbenefit the robotics community and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Most knowledge graphs (KGs) are incomplete, which motivates one important\nresearch topic on automatically complementing knowledge graphs. However,\nevaluation of knowledge graph completion (KGC) models often ignores the\nincompleteness -- facts in the test set are ranked against all unknown triplets\nwhich may contain a large number of missing facts not included in the KG yet.\nTreating all unknown triplets as false is called the closed-world assumption.\nThis closed-world assumption might negatively affect the fairness and\nconsistency of the evaluation metrics. In this paper, we study KGC evaluation\nunder a more realistic setting, namely the open-world assumption, where unknown\ntriplets are considered to include many missing facts not included in the\ntraining or test sets. For the currently most used metrics such as mean\nreciprocal rank (MRR) and Hits@K, we point out that their behavior may be\nunexpected under the open-world assumption. Specifically, with not many missing\nfacts, their numbers show a logarithmic trend with respect to the true strength\nof the model, and thus, the metric increase could be insignificant in terms of\nreflecting the true model improvement. Further, considering the variance, we\nshow that the degradation in the reported numbers may result in incorrect\ncomparisons between different models, where stronger models may have lower\nmetric numbers.

    "abstract": "Robotic peg-in-hole assembly remains a challenging task due to its high\naccuracy demand. Previous work tends to simplify the problem by restricting the\ndegree of freedom of the end-effector, or limiting the distance between the\ntarget and the initial pose position, which prevents them from being deployed\nin real-world manufacturing. Thus, we present a Coarse-to-Fine Visual Servoing\n(CFVS) peg-in-hole method, achieving 6-DoF end-effector motion control based on\n3D visual feedback. CFVS can handle arbitrary tilt angles and large initial\nalignment errors through a fast pose estimation before refinement. Furthermore,\nby introducing a confidence map to ignore the irrelevant contour of objects,\nCFVS is robust against noise and can deal with various targets beyond training\ndata. Extensive experiments show CFVS outperforms state-of-the-art methods and\nobtains 100%, 91%, and 82% average success rates in 3-DoF, 4-DoF, and 6-DoF\npeg-in-hole, respectively.",

In this paper, we propose a highly adaptive 3D\nmesh steganography based on feature-preserving distortion (FPD), which\nguarantees high embedding capacity while effectively resisting 3D steganalysis.\nSpecifically, we first transform vertex coordinates into integers and derive\nbitplanes from them to construct the embedding domain. To better measure the\nmesh distortion caused by message embedding, we propose FPD based on the most\neffective sub-features of the state-of-the-art steganalytic feature set. By\nimproving and minimizing FPD, we can efficiently calculate the optimal\nvertex-changing distribution and simultaneously preserve mesh features, such as\nsteganalytic and geometric features, to a certain extent. By virtue of the\noptimal distribution, we adopt the Q-layered syndrome trellis coding (STC) for\npractical message embedding. However, when Q varies, calculating bit\nmodification probability (BMP) in each layer of Q-layered will be cumbersome.\nHence, we contrapuntally design a universal and automatic BMP calculation\napproach.

    "abstract": "The electricity industry is heavily implementing smart grid technologies to\nimprove reliability, availability, security, and efficiency. This\nimplementation needs technological advancements, the development of standards\nand regulations, as well as testing and planning. Smart grid load forecasting\nand management are critical for reducing demand volatility and improving the\nmarket mechanism that connects generators, distributors, and retailers. During\npolicy implementations or external interventions, it is necessary to analyse\nthe uncertainty of their impact on the electricity demand to enable a more\naccurate response of the system to fluctuating demand. This paper analyses the\nuncertainties of external intervention impacts on electricity demand. It\nimplements a framework that combines probabilistic and global forecasting\nmodels using a deep learning approach to estimate the causal impact\ndistribution of an intervention. The causal effect is assessed by predicting\nthe counterfactual distribution outcome for the affected instances and then\ncontrasting it to the real outcomes. We consider the impact of Covid-19\nlockdowns on energy usage as a case study to evaluate the non-uniform effect of\nthis intervention on the electricity demand distribution. We could show that\nduring the initial lockdowns in Australia and some European countries, there\nwas often a more significant decrease in the troughs than in the peaks, while\nthe mean remained almost unaffected.",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning methods based on image patch reconstruction have\nwitnessed great success in training auto-encoders, whose pre-trained weights\ncan be transferred to fine-tune other downstream tasks of image understanding.\nHowever, existing methods seldom study the various importance of reconstructed\npatches and the symmetry of anatomical structures, when they are applied to 3D\nmedical images. In this paper we propose a novel Attentive Symmetric\nAuto-encoder (ASA) based on Vision Transformer (ViT) for 3D brain MRI\nsegmentation tasks. We conjecture that forcing the auto-encoder to recover\ninformative image regions can harvest more discriminative representations, than\nto recover smooth image patches. Then we adopt a gradient based metric to\nestimate the importance of each image patch. In the pre-training stage, the\nproposed auto-encoder pays more attention to reconstruct the informative\npatches according to the gradient metrics. Moreover, we resort to the prior of\nbrain structures and develop a Symmetric Position Encoding (SPE) method to\nbetter exploit the correlations between long-range but spatially symmetric\nregions to obtain effective features. Experimental results show that our\nproposed attentive symmetric auto-encoder outperforms the state-of-the-art\nself-supervised learning methods and medical image segmentation models on three\nbrain MRI segmentation benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we develop upon the emerging topic of loss function learning,\nwhich aims to learn loss functions that significantly improve the performance\nof the models trained under them. Specifically, we propose a new meta-learning\nframework for learning model-agnostic loss functions via a hybrid\nneuro-symbolic search approach. The framework first uses evolution-based\nmethods to search the space of primitive mathematical operations to find a set\nof symbolic loss functions. Second, the set of learned loss functions are\nsubsequently parameterized and optimized via an end-to-end gradient-based\ntraining procedure. The versatility of the proposed framework is empirically\nvalidated on a diverse set of supervised learning tasks. Results show that the\nmeta-learned loss functions discovered by the newly proposed method outperform\nboth the cross-entropy loss and state-of-the-art loss function learning methods\non a diverse range of neural network architectures and datasets.",

Inspired by the order-preserving matching, the existing\norder-preserving pattern (OPP) mining algorithm employs order-preserving\nmatching to calculate the support, which leads to low efficiency. To address\nthis deficiency, this paper proposes an algorithm called efficient frequent OPP\nminer (EFO-Miner) to find all frequent OPPs. EFO-Miner is composed of four\nparts: a pattern fusion strategy to generate candidate patterns, a matching\nprocess for the results of sub-patterns to calculate the support of\nsuper-patterns, a screening strategy to dynamically reduce the size of prefix\nand suffix arrays, and a pruning strategy to further dynamically prune\ncandidate patterns. Moreover, this paper explores the order-preserving rule\n(OPR) mining and proposes an algorithm called OPR-Miner to discover strong\nrules from all frequent OPPs using EFO-Miner.

Our analysis reveals that PIM greatly benefits\nmemory-bound NNs: (1) UPMEM provides 23x the performance of a high-end GPU when\nthe GPU requires memory oversubscription for a general matrix-vector\nmultiplication kernel; (2) Mensa improves energy efficiency and throughput by\n3.0x and 3.1x over the Google Edge TPU for 24 Google edge NN models; and (3)\nSIMDRAM outperforms a CPU/GPU by 16.7x/1.4x for three binary NNs.

Though many latest self-supervised pre-training methods have\nachieved impressive performance on various vision tasks under the prevailing\npretrain-finetune paradigm, their generalization capacity to multi-task\nlearning scenarios is yet to be explored. In this paper, we extensively\ninvestigate the transfer performance of various types of self-supervised\nmethods, e.g., MoCo and SimCLR, on three downstream tasks, including semantic\nsegmentation, drivable area segmentation, and traffic object detection, on the\nlarge-scale driving dataset BDD100K. We surprisingly find that their\nperformances are sub-optimal or even lag far behind the single-task baseline,\nwhich may be due to the distinctions of training objectives and architectural\ndesign lied in the pretrain-finetune paradigm. To overcome this dilemma as well\nas avoid redesigning the resource-intensive pre-training stage, we propose a\nsimple yet effective pretrain-adapt-finetune paradigm for general multi-task\ntraining, where the off-the-shelf pretrained models can be effectively adapted\nwithout increasing the training overhead.

    "title": "Adopting Automated Bug Assignment in Practice: A Longitudinal Case Study  at Ericsson",
    "abstract": "The continuous inflow of bug reports is a considerable challenge in large\ndevelopment projects. Inspired by contemporary work on mining software\nrepositories, we designed a prototype bug assignment solution based on machine\nlearning in 2011-2016. The prototype evolved into an internal Ericsson product,\nTRR, in 2017-2018. TRR's first bug assignment without human intervention\nhappened in April 2019. Our study evaluates the adoption of TRR within its\nindustrial context at Ericsson. Moreover, we investigate 1) how TRR performs in\nthe field, 2) what value TRR provides to Ericsson, and 3) how TRR has\ninfluenced the ways of working. We conduct an industrial case study combining\ninterviews with TRR stakeholders, minutes from sprint planning meetings, and\nbug tracking data. The data analysis includes thematic analysis, descriptive\nstatistics, and Bayesian causal analysis. TRR is now an incorporated part of\nthe bug assignment process. Considering the abstraction levels of the\ntelecommunications stack, high-level modules are more positive while low-level\nmodules experienced some drawbacks. On average, TRR automatically assigns 30%\nof the incoming bug reports with an accuracy of 75%. Auto-routed TRs are\nresolved around 21% faster within Ericsson, and TRR has saved highly seasoned\nengineers many hours of work. Indirect effects of adopting TRR include process\nimprovements, process awareness, increased communication, and higher job\nsatisfaction. TRR has saved time at Ericsson, but the adoption of automated bug\nassignment was more intricate compared to similar endeavors reported from other\ncompanies. We primarily attribute the difference to the very large size of the\norganization and the complex products. Key facilitators in the successful\nadoption include a gradual introduction, product champions, and careful\nstakeholder analysis.",

We\ndesign the encoder using Vision Transformer with deformable convolution, which\nenables us not only to plug pretrained models from normal videos into our\narchitecture without additional modules or finetuning but also to perform\ngeometric approximation only once, unlike previous deep CNN-based approaches.\nThanks to its powerful encoder, PAVER can learn the saliency from three simple\nrelative relations among local patch features, outperforming state-of-the-art\nmodels for the Wild360 benchmark by large margins without supervision or\nauxiliary information like class activation.

While a\nnumber of prior methods aimed to address this setting with variants of\nimitation and offline reinforcement learning, the learned behavior is typically\nnarrow and often struggles to reach configurable long-horizon goals.

    "abstract": "Background: Code summarization automatically generates the corresponding\nnatural language descriptions according to the input code. Comprehensiveness of\ncode representation is critical to code summarization task. However, most\nexisting approaches typically use coarse-grained fusion methods to integrate\nmulti-modal features. They generally represent different modalities of a piece\nof code, such as an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and a token sequence, as two\nembeddings and then fuse the two ones at the AST/code levels. Such a coarse\nintegration makes it difficult to learn the correlations between fine-grained\ncode elements across modalities effectively. Aims: This study intends to\nimprove the model's prediction performance for high-quality code summarization\nby accurately aligning and fully fusing semantic and syntactic structure\ninformation of source code at node/token levels. Method: This paper proposes a\nMulti-Modal Fine-grained Feature Fusion approach (MMF3) for neural code\nsummarization. We introduce a novel fine-grained fusion method, which allows\nfine-grained fusion of multiple code modalities at the token and node levels.\nSpecifically, we use this method to fuse information from both token and AST\nmodalities and apply the fused features to code summarization. Results: We\nconduct experiments on one Java and one Python datasets, and evaluate generated\nsummaries using four metrics. The results show that: 1) the performance of our\nmodel outperforms the current state-of-the-art models, and 2) the ablation\nexperiments show that our proposed fine-grained fusion method can effectively\nimprove the accuracy of generated summaries. Conclusion: MMF3 can mine the\nrelationships between crossmodal elements and perform accurate fine-grained\nelement-level alignment fusion accordingly. As a result, more clues can be\nprovided to improve the accuracy of the generated code summaries.",

    "abstract": "Current language models have been criticised for learning language from text\nalone without connection between words and their meaning. Consequently,\nmultimodal training has been proposed as a way for creating models with better\nlanguage understanding by providing the lacking connection. We focus on\npre-trained multimodal vision-and-language (VL) models for which there already\nare some results on their language understanding capabilities. An unresolved\nissue with evaluating the linguistic skills of these models, however, is that\nthere is no established method for adapting them to text-only input without\nout-of-distribution uncertainty. To find the best approach, we investigate and\ncompare seven possible methods for adapting three different pre-trained VL\nmodels to text-only input. Our evaluations on both GLUE and Visual Property\nNorms (VPN) show that care should be put into adapting VL models to zero-shot\ntext-only tasks, while the models are less sensitive to how we adapt them to\nnon-zero-shot tasks. We also find that the adaptation methods perform\ndifferently for different models and that unimodal model counterparts perform\non par with the VL models regardless of adaptation, indicating that current VL\nmodels do not necessarily gain better language understanding from their\nmultimodal training.",

However, designing the RIS phases according to the\ninstantaneous channel state information (CSI) can be challenging in practice\ndue to the short coherent time of the channel. In this regard, we propose a\nnovel algorithm based on the channel statistics of massive multiple input\nmultiple output systems rather than the CSI. The beamforming at the base\nstation (BS), power allocation of the users, and phase shifts at the RIS\nelements are optimized to maximize the minimum signal to interference and noise\nratio (SINR), guaranteeing fair operation among various users. In particular,\nwe design the RIS phases by leveraging the asymptotic deterministic equivalent\nof the minimum SINR that depends only on the channel statistics. This\nsignificantly reduces the computational complexity and the amount of\ncontrolling data between the BS and RIS for updating the phases. This setup is\nalso useful for electromagnetic fields (EMF)-aware systems with constraints on\nthe maximum user's exposure to EMF. The numerical results show that the\nproposed algorithms achieve more than 100% gain in terms of minimum SINR,\ncompared to a system with random RIS phase shifts, with 40 RIS elements, 20\nantennas at the BS and 10 users, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Transformer is a transformative framework that models sequential data and has\nachieved remarkable performance on a wide range of tasks, but with high\ncomputational and energy cost. To improve its efficiency, a popular choice is\nto compress the models via binarization which constrains the floating-point\nvalues into binary ones to save resource consumption owing to cheap bitwise\noperations significantly. However, existing binarization methods only aim at\nminimizing the information loss for the input distribution statistically, while\nignoring the pairwise similarity modeling at the core of the attention\nmechanism. To this end, we propose a new binarization paradigm customized to\nhigh-dimensional softmax attention via kernelized hashing, called EcoFormer, to\nmap the original queries and keys into low-dimensional binary codes in Hamming\nspace. The kernelized hash functions are learned to match the ground-truth\nsimilarity relations extracted from the attention map in a self-supervised way.\nBased on the equivalence between the inner product of binary codes and the\nHamming distance as well as the associative property of matrix multiplication,\nwe can approximate the attention in linear complexity by expressing it as a\ndot-product of binary codes. Moreover, the compact binary representations of\nqueries and keys enable us to replace most of the expensive multiply-accumulate\noperations in attention with simple accumulations to save considerable on-chip\nenergy footprint on edge devices. Extensive experiments on both vision and\nlanguage tasks show that EcoFormer consistently achieves comparable performance\nwith standard attentions while consuming much fewer resources. For example,\nbased on PVTv2-B0 and ImageNet-1K, Ecoformer achieves a 73% energy footprint\nreduction with only a 0.33% performance drop compared to the standard\nattention.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) and trajectory optimization (TO) present strong\ncomplementary advantages. On one hand, RL approaches are able to learn global\ncontrol policies directly from data, but generally require large sample sizes\nto properly converge towards feasible policies. On the other hand, TO methods\nare able to exploit gradient-based information extracted from simulators to\nquickly converge towards a locally optimal control trajectory which is only\nvalid within the vicinity of the solution. Over the past decade, several\napproaches have aimed to adequately combine the two classes of methods in order\nto obtain the best of both worlds. Following on from this line of research, we\npropose several improvements on top of these approaches to learn global control\npolicies quicker, notably by leveraging sensitivity information stemming from\nTO methods via Sobolev learning, and augmented Lagrangian techniques to enforce\nthe consensus between TO and policy learning. We evaluate the benefits of these\nimprovements on various classical tasks in robotics through comparison with\nexisting approaches in the literature.",

For track 1, we develop a\npowerful U-Net-based speaker embedding extractor with a symmetric architecture.\nThe proposed system achieves 2.06% in EER and 0.1293 in MinDCF on the\nvalidation set.

For track 3, we\nemploy the joint training of source domain supervision and target domain\nself-supervision to get a speaker embedding extractor. The subsequent\nclustering process can obtain target domain pseudo-speaker labels. We adapt the\nspeaker embedding extractor using all source and target domain data in a\nsupervised manner, where it can fully leverage both domain information.\nMoreover, clustering and supervised domain adaptation can be repeated until the\nperformance converges on the validation set.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised models are increasingly prevalent in machine learning (ML)\nsince they reduce the need for expensively labeled data. Because of their\nversatility in downstream applications, they are increasingly used as a service\nexposed via public APIs. At the same time, these encoder models are\nparticularly vulnerable to model stealing attacks due to the high\ndimensionality of vector representations they output. Yet, encoders remain\nundefended: existing mitigation strategies for stealing attacks focus on\nsupervised learning. We introduce a new dataset inference defense, which uses\nthe private training set of the victim encoder model to attribute its ownership\nin the event of stealing. The intuition is that the log-likelihood of an\nencoder's output representations is higher on the victim's training data than\non test data if it is stolen from the victim, but not if it is independently\ntrained. We compute this log-likelihood using density estimation models. As\npart of our evaluation, we also propose measuring the fidelity of stolen\nencoders and quantifying the effectiveness of the theft detection without\ninvolving downstream tasks; instead, we leverage mutual information and\ndistance measurements. Our extensive empirical results in the vision domain\ndemonstrate that dataset inference is a promising direction for defending\nself-supervised models against model stealing.",

    "abstract": "Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a state-of-the-art (SOTA) control technique\nwhich requires solving hard constrained optimization problems iteratively. For\nuncertain dynamics, analytical model based robust MPC imposes additional\nconstraints, increasing the hardness of the problem. The problem exacerbates in\nperformance-critical applications, when more compute is required in lesser\ntime. Data-driven regression methods such as Neural Networks have been proposed\nin the past to approximate system dynamics. However, such models rely on high\nvolumes of labeled data, in the absence of symbolic analytical priors. This\nincurs non-trivial training overheads. Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs)\nhave gained traction for approximating non-linear system of ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODEs), with reasonable accuracy. In this work, we\npropose a Robust Adaptive MPC framework via PINNs (RAMP-Net), which uses a\nneural network trained partly from simple ODEs and partly from data. A physics\nloss is used to learn simple ODEs representing ideal dynamics. Having access to\nanalytical functions inside the loss function acts as a regularizer, enforcing\nrobust behavior for parametric uncertainties. On the other hand, a regular data\nloss is used for adapting to residual disturbances (non-parametric\nuncertainties), unaccounted during mathematical modelling. Experiments are\nperformed in a simulated environment for trajectory tracking of a quadrotor.

To address this issue, this work first\npresents a Combined Attribute Annotated PAD Dataset (CAAD-PAD) by combining\nseveral well-known PAD datasets where we provide seven human-annotated\nattribute labels. This work then comprehensively analyses the fairness of a set\nof face PADs and its relation to the nature of training data and the\nOperational Decision Threshold Assignment (ODTA) on different data groups by\nstudying four face PAD approaches on our CAAD-PAD. To simultaneously represent\nboth the PAD fairness and the absolute PAD performance, we introduce a novel\nmetric, namely the Accuracy Balanced Fairness (ABF). Extensive experiments on\nCAAD-PAD show that the training data and ODTA induce unfairness on gender,\nocclusion, and other attribute groups.

We construct an auxiliary temporal periodic problem\nand an effective time-average equation to approximate the original problem and\nanalyze the approximation error of the corresponding linearized PDE (Stokes)\nsystem, where the simple front-tracking technique is used to update the slow\nmoving boundary. An effective multiscale method is then designed based on the\napproximate problem and the front tracking framework. We also present a\ntemporal finite difference scheme with a spatial continuous finite element\nmethod and analyze its temporal discrete error. Furthermore, a fast iterative\nprocedure is designed to find the initial value of the temporal periodic\nproblem and its convergence is analyzed as well. Our designed front-tracking\nframework and the iterative procedure for solving the temporal periodic problem\nmake it easy to implement the multiscale method on existing PDE solving\nsoftware. The numerical method is implemented by a combination of the finite\nelement platform COMSOL Multiphysics and the mainstream software MATLAB, which\nsignificantly reduce the programming effort and easily handle the\nfluid-structure interaction, especially moving boundaries with more complex\ngeometries. We present some numerical examples of ODEs and 2-D Navier-Stokes\nsystem to demonstrate the effectiveness of the multiscale method. Finally, we\nhave a numerical experiment on the plaque growth problem and discuss the\nphysical implication of the fractional order parameter.",

    "abstract": "We study the practical task of fine-grained 3D-VR-sketch-based 3D shape\nretrieval. This task is of particular interest as 2D sketches were shown to be\neffective queries for 2D images. However, due to the domain gap, it remains\nhard to achieve strong performance in 3D shape retrieval from 2D sketches.\nRecent work demonstrated the advantage of 3D VR sketching on this task. In our\nwork, we focus on the challenge caused by inherent inaccuracies in 3D VR\nsketches. We observe that retrieval results obtained with a triplet loss with a\nfixed margin value, commonly used for retrieval tasks, contain many irrelevant\nshapes and often just one or few with a similar structure to the query. To\nmitigate this problem, we for the first time draw a connection between adaptive\nmargin values and shape similarities. In particular, we propose to use a\ntriplet loss with an adaptive margin value driven by a \"fitting gap\", which is\nthe similarity of two shapes under structure-preserving deformations. We also\nconduct a user study which confirms that this fitting gap is indeed a suitable\ncriterion to evaluate the structural similarity of shapes. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a dataset of 202 VR sketches for 202 3D shapes drawn from memory\nrather than from observation.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of finding a maximal independent set (MIS) in the\nshared blackboard communication model with vertex-partitioned inputs. There are\n$n$ players corresponding to vertices of an undirected graph, and each player\nsees the edges incident on its vertex -- this way, each edge is known by both\nits endpoints and is thus shared by two players. The players communicate in\nsimultaneous rounds by posting their messages on a shared blackboard visible to\nall players, with the goal of computing an MIS of the graph. While the MIS\nproblem is well studied in other distributed models, and while shared\nblackboard is, perhaps, the simplest broadcast model, lower bounds for our\nproblem were only known against one-round protocols.\nWe present a lower bound on the round-communication tradeoff for computing an\nMIS in this model. Specifically, we show that when $r$ rounds of interaction\nare allowed, at least one player needs to communicate $\\Omega(n^{1/20^{r+1}})$\nbits. In particular, with logarithmic bandwidth, finding an MIS requires\n$\\Omega(\\log\\log{n})$ rounds. This lower bound can be compared with the\nalgorithm of Ghaffari, Gouleakis, Konrad, Mitrovi\\'c, and Rubinfeld [PODC 2018]\nthat solves MIS in $O(\\log\\log{n})$ rounds but with a logarithmic bandwidth for\nan average player. Additionally, our lower bound further extends to the closely\nrelated problem of maximal bipartite matching.\nTo prove our results, we devise a new round elimination framework, which we\ncall partial-input embedding, that may also be useful in future work for\nproving round-sensitive lower bounds in the presence of edge-sharing between\nplayers.\nFinally, we discuss several implications of our results to multi-round\n(adaptive) distributed sketching algorithms, broadcast congested clique, and to\nthe welfare maximization problem in two-sided matching markets.",

In this context, multimodal\napproaches have been shown to improve performance (over unimodal approaches) by\ncombining diverse and complementary sources of information, providing some\nrobustness to noisy and missing modalities. In this paper, we focus on\ndimensional ER based on the fusion of facial and vocal modalities extracted\nfrom videos, where complementary audio-visual (A-V) relationships are explored\nto predict an individual's emotional states in valence-arousal space. Most\nstate-of-the-art fusion techniques rely on recurrent networks or conventional\nattention mechanisms that do not effectively leverage the complementary nature\nof A-V modalities. To address this problem, we introduce a joint\ncross-attentional model for A-V fusion that extracts the salient features\nacross A-V modalities, that allows to effectively leverage the inter-modal\nrelationships, while retaining the intra-modal relationships. In particular, it\ncomputes the cross-attention weights based on correlation between the joint\nfeature representation and that of the individual modalities. By deploying the\njoint A-V feature representation into the cross-attention module, it helps to\nsimultaneously leverage both the intra and inter modal relationships, thereby\nsignificantly improving the performance of the system over the vanilla\ncross-attention module. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is validated\nexperimentally on challenging videos from the RECOLA and AffWild2 datasets.\nResults indicate that our joint cross-attentional A-V fusion model provides a\ncost-effective solution that can outperform state-of-the-art approaches, even\nwhen the modalities are noisy or absent.",

Traditional approaches produce\nestimations through constructing an interpolation function that combines\nmultiple basis functions.

Recent advances exhibit an alternative strategy that learns\ninterpolation functions directly from observed points using machine learning\ntechniques, say deep neural networks. This strategy, although promising, cannot\neffectively exploit the correlations between observed points and target points\nas it treats these types of points separately. Here, we present a\nlearning-based approach to numerical interpolation using encoder\nrepresentations of Transformers (thus called NIERT). NIERT treats the value of\neach target point as a masked token, which enables processing target points and\nobserved points in a unified fashion. By calculating the partial self-attention\nbetween target points and observed points at each layer, NIERT gains advantages\nof exploiting the correlations among these points and, more importantly,\navoiding the unexpected interference of target points on observed points.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel algorithm to obtain the closed-form\nanti-derivative of a function using Deep Neural Network architecture. In the\npast, mathematicians have developed several numerical techniques to approximate\nthe values of definite integrals, but primitives or indefinite integrals are\noften non-elementary. Anti-derivatives are necessarily required when there are\nseveral parameters in an integrand and the integral obtained is a function of\nthose parameters. There is no theoretical method that can do this for any given\nfunction. Some existing ways to get around this are primarily based on either\ncurve fitting or infinite series approximation of the integrand, which is then\nintegrated theoretically. Curve fitting approximations are inaccurate for\nhighly non-linear functions and require a different approach for every problem.\nOn the other hand, the infinite series approach does not give a closed-form\nsolution, and their truncated forms are often inaccurate. We claim that using a\nsingle method for all integrals, our algorithm can approximate anti-derivatives\nto any required accuracy. We have used this algorithm to obtain the\nanti-derivatives of several functions, including non-elementary and oscillatory\nintegrals. This paper also shows the applications of our method to get the\nclosed-form expressions of elliptic integrals, Fermi-Dirac integrals, and\ncumulative distribution functions and decrease the computation time of the\nGalerkin method for differential equations.",

    "abstract": "Wearable sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) has emerged as a\nprincipal research area and is utilized in a variety of applications. Recently,\ndeep learning-based methods have achieved significant improvement in the HAR\nfield with the development of human-computer interaction applications. However,\nthey are limited to operating in a local neighborhood in the process of a\nstandard convolution neural network, and correlations between different sensors\non body positions are ignored. In addition, they still face significant\nchallenging problems with performance degradation due to large gaps in the\ndistribution of training and test data, and behavioral differences between\nsubjects. In this work, we propose a novel Transformer-based Adversarial\nlearning framework for human activity recognition using wearable sensors via\nSelf-KnowledgE Distillation (TASKED), that accounts for individual sensor\norientations and spatial and temporal features. The proposed method is capable\nof learning cross-domain embedding feature representations from multiple\nsubjects datasets using adversarial learning and the maximum mean discrepancy\n(MMD) regularization to align the data distribution over multiple domains. In\nthe proposed method, we adopt the teacher-free self-knowledge distillation to\nimprove the stability of the training procedure and the performance of human\nactivity recognition. Experimental results show that TASKED not only\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods on the four real-world public HAR datasets\n(alone or combined) but also improves the subject generalization effectively.",

    "abstract": "Active inference is a first principles approach for understanding the brain\nin particular, and sentient agents in general, with the single imperative of\nminimizing free energy. As such, it provides a computational account for\nmodelling artificial intelligent agents, by defining the agent's generative\nmodel and inferring the model parameters, actions and hidden state beliefs.\nHowever, the exact specification of the generative model and the hidden state\nspace structure is left to the experimenter, whose design choices influence the\nresulting behaviour of the agent. Recently, deep learning methods have been\nproposed to learn a hidden state space structure purely from data, alleviating\nthe experimenter from this tedious design task, but resulting in an entangled,\nnon-interpreteable state space. In this paper, we hypothesize that such a\nlearnt, entangled state space does not necessarily yield the best model in\nterms of free energy, and that enforcing different factors in the state space\ncan yield a lower model complexity. In particular, we consider the problem of\n3D object representation, and focus on different instances of the ShapeNet\ndataset. We propose a model that factorizes object shape, pose and category,\nwhile still learning a representation for each factor using a deep neural\nnetwork. We show that models, with best disentanglement properties, perform\nbest when adopted by an active agent in reaching preferred observations.",

    "abstract": "We show that combining human prior knowledge with end-to-end learning can\nimprove the robustness of deep neural networks by introducing a part-based\nmodel for object classification. We believe that the richer form of annotation\nhelps guide neural networks to learn more robust features without requiring\nmore samples or larger models. Our model combines a part segmentation model\nwith a tiny classifier and is trained end-to-end to simultaneously segment\nobjects into parts and then classify the segmented object. Empirically, our\npart-based models achieve both higher accuracy and higher adversarial\nrobustness than a ResNet-50 baseline on all three datasets. For instance, the\nclean accuracy of our part models is up to 15 percentage points higher than the\nbaseline's, given the same level of robustness. Our experiments indicate that\nthese models also reduce texture bias and yield better robustness against\ncommon corruptions and spurious correlations.

    "abstract": "In today's technological era, document images play an important and integral\npart in our day to day life, and specifically with the surge of Covid-19,\ndigitally scanned documents have become key source of communication, thus\navoiding any sort of infection through physical contact. Storage and\ntransmission of scanned document images is a very memory intensive task, hence\ncompression techniques are being used to reduce the image size before archival\nand transmission. To extract information or to operate on the compressed\nimages, we have two ways of doing it. The first way is to decompress the image\nand operate on it and subsequently compress it again for the efficiency of\nstorage and transmission. The other way is to use the characteristics of the\nunderlying compression algorithm to directly process the images in their\ncompressed form without involving decompression and re-compression. In this\npaper, we propose a novel idea of developing an OCR for CCITT (The\nInternational Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee) compressed\nmachine printed TIFF document images directly in the compressed domain. After\nsegmenting text regions into lines and words, HMM is applied for recognition\nusing three coding modes of CCITT- horizontal, vertical and the pass mode.\nExperimental results show that OCR on pass modes give a promising results.",

    "title": "A Closer Look at Novel Class Discovery from the Labeled Set",
    "abstract": "Novel class discovery (NCD) aims to infer novel categories in an unlabeled\ndataset leveraging prior knowledge of a labeled set comprising disjoint but\nrelated classes. Existing research focuses primarily on utilizing the labeled\nset at the methodological level, with less emphasis on the analysis of the\nlabeled set itself. Thus, in this paper, we rethink novel class discovery from\nthe labeled set and focus on two core questions: (i) Given a specific unlabeled\nset, what kind of labeled set can best support novel class discovery? (ii) A\nfundamental premise of NCD is that the labeled set must be related to the\nunlabeled set, but how can we measure this relation? For (i), we propose and\nsubstantiate the hypothesis that NCD could benefit more from a labeled set with\na large degree of semantic similarity to the unlabeled set. Specifically, we\nestablish an extensive and large-scale benchmark with varying degrees of\nsemantic similarity between labeled/unlabeled datasets on ImageNet by\nleveraging its hierarchical class structure. As a sharp contrast, the existing\nNCD benchmarks are developed based on labeled sets with different number of\ncategories and images, and completely ignore the semantic relation. For (ii),\nwe introduce a mathematical definition for quantifying the semantic similarity\nbetween labeled and unlabeled sets. In addition, we use this metric to confirm\nthe validity of our proposed benchmark and demonstrate that it highly\ncorrelates with NCD performance. Furthermore, without quantitative analysis,\nprevious works commonly believe that label information is always beneficial.\nHowever, counterintuitively, our experimental results show that using labels\nmay lead to sub-optimal outcomes in low-similarity settings.",

Despite the recent progress in human motion prediction, most\nstudies simplify the problem by predicting the human motion relative to a fixed\njoint and/or only limit their model to predict one possible future motion.\nWhile due to the complex nature of human motion, a single output cannot reflect\nall the possible actions one can do. Also, for any robotics application, we\nneed the full human motion including the user trajectory not a 3d pose relative\nto the hip joint.\nIn this paper, we try to address these two issues by proposing a\ntransformer-based generative model for forecasting multiple diverse human\nmotions. Our model generates \\textit{N} future possible motion by querying a\nhistory of human motion. Our model first predicts the pose of the body relative\nto the hip joint. Then the \\textit{Hip Prediction Module} predicts the\ntrajectory of the hip movement for each predicted pose frame. To emphasize on\nthe diverse future motions we introduce a similarity loss that penalizes the\npairwise sample distance.

    "abstract": "The next generation ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (xURLLC)\nneed novel design to provide satisfactory services to the emerging\nmission-critical applications. To improve the spectrum efficiency and enhance\nthe robustness of xURLLC, this paper proposes a robust beamforming and\nrate-splitting design in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime for downlink\nmulti-user multi-antenna xURLLC systems. In the design, adaptive rate-splitting\nis introduced to flexibly handle the complex inter-user interference and thus\nimprove the spectrum efficiency. Taking the imperfection of the channel state\ninformation at the transmitter (CSIT) into consideration, a max-min user rate\nproblem is formulated to optimize the common and private beamforming vectors\nand the rate-splitting vector under the premise of ensuring the requirements of\ntransmission latency and reliability of all the users. The optimization problem\nis intractable due to the non-convexity of the constraint set and the infinite\nconstraints caused by CSIT uncertainties. To solve it, we convert the infinite\nconstraints into finite ones by the S-Procedure method and transform the\noriginal problem into a difference of convex (DC) programming. A constrained\nconcave convex procedure (CCCP) and the Gaussian randomization based iterative\nalgorithm is proposed to obtain a local minimum. Simulation results confirm the\nconvergence, robustness and effectiveness of the proposed robust beamforming\nand rate-splitting design in the FBL regime. It is also shown that the proposed\nrobust design achieves considerable performance gain in the worst user rate\ncompared with existing transmission schemes under various blocklength and block\nerror rate requirements.",

    "abstract": "Detecting accounting anomalies is a recurrent challenge in financial\nstatement audits. Recently, novel methods derived from Deep-Learning (DL) have\nbeen proposed to audit the large volumes of a statement's underlying accounting\nrecords. However, due to their vast number of parameters, such models exhibit\nthe drawback of being inherently opaque. At the same time, the concealing of a\nmodel's inner workings often hinders its real-world application. This\nobservation holds particularly true in financial audits since auditors must\nreasonably explain and justify their audit decisions. Nowadays, various\nExplainable AI (XAI) techniques have been proposed to address this challenge,\ne.g., SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). However, in unsupervised DL as\noften applied in financial audits, these methods explain the model output at\nthe level of encoded variables. As a result, the explanations of Autoencoder\nNeural Networks (AENNs) are often hard to comprehend by human auditors. To\nmitigate this drawback, we propose (RESHAPE), which explains the model output\non an aggregated attribute-level. In addition, we introduce an evaluation\nframework to compare the versatility of XAI methods in auditing. Our\nexperimental results show empirical evidence that RESHAPE results in versatile\nexplanations compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

When the population of patients with\nobserved labels is only a subset of the deployment population (label\nselection), standard model performance estimates on the observed population may\nbe misleading. In this study we describe three classes of label selection and\nsimulate five causally distinct scenarios to assess how particular selection\nmechanisms bias a suite of commonly reported binary machine learning model\nperformance metrics. Simulations reveal that when selection is affected by\nobserved features, naive estimates of model discrimination may be misleading.\nWhen selection is affected by labels, naive estimates of calibration fail to\nreflect reality. We borrow traditional weighting estimators from causal\ninference literature and find that when selection probabilities are properly\nspecified, they recover full population estimates. We then tackle the\nreal-world task of monitoring the performance of deployed machine learning\nmodels whose interactions with clinicians feed-back and affect the selection\nmechanism of the labels. We train three machine learning models to flag\nlow-yield laboratory diagnostics, and simulate their intended consequence of\nreducing wasteful laboratory utilization. We find that naive estimates of AUROC\non the observed population undershoot actual performance by up to 20%. Such a\ndisparity could be large enough to lead to the wrongful termination of a\nsuccessful clinical decision support tool.

In this work we\nfocus on a perturbation-based, model-agnostic explainability method called\nRISE, elaborate on observed shortcomings of its grid-based approach and propose\ntwo modifications: replacement of square occlusions with convex polygonal\nocclusions based on cells of a Voronoi mesh and addition of an informativeness\nguarantee to the occlusion mask generator. These modifications, collectively\ncalled VRISE (Voronoi-RISE), are meant to, respectively, improve the accuracy\nof maps generated using large occlusions and accelerate convergence of saliency\nmaps in cases where sampling density is either very low or very high. We\nperform a quantitative comparison of accuracy of saliency maps produced by\nVRISE and RISE on the validation split of ILSVRC2012, using a saliency-guided\ncontent insertion/deletion metric and a localization metric based on bounding\nboxes. Additionally, we explore the space of configurable occlusion pattern\nparameters to better understand their influence on saliency maps produced by\nRISE and VRISE. We also describe and demonstrate two effects observed over the\ncourse of experimentation, arising from the random sampling approach of RISE:\n\"feature slicing\" and \"saliency misattribution\".

Changes in image statistics\nor distracting background elements are pitfalls that prevent generalization and\nreal-world applicability of such control policies. We elaborate on the\nintuition that a good visual policy should be able to identify which pixels are\nimportant for its decision, and preserve this identification of important\nsources of information across images. This implies that training of a policy\nwith small generalization gap should focus on such important pixels and ignore\nthe others. This leads to the introduction of saliency-guided Q-networks\n(SGQN), a generic method for visual reinforcement learning, that is compatible\nwith any value function learning method. SGQN vastly improves the\ngeneralization capability of Soft Actor-Critic agents and outperforms existing\nstateof-the-art methods on the Deepmind Control Generalization benchmark,\nsetting a new reference in terms of training efficiency, generalization gap,\nand policy interpretability.",

    "abstract": "Many emerging Internet of Things (IoT) applications rely on information\ncollected by sensor nodes where the freshness of information is an important\ncriterion. \\textit{Age of Information} (AoI) is a metric that quantifies\ninformation timeliness, i.e., the freshness of the received information or\nstatus update. This work considers a setup of deployed sensors in an IoT\nnetwork, where multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) serve as mobile relay\nnodes between the sensors and the base station. We formulate an optimization\nproblem to jointly plan the UAVs' trajectory, while minimizing the AoI of the\nreceived messages. This ensures that the received information at the base\nstation is as fresh as possible. The complex optimization problem is\nefficiently solved using a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. In\nparticular, we propose a deep Q-network, which works as a function\napproximation to estimate the state-action value function. The proposed scheme\nis quick to converge and results in a lower AoI than the random walk scheme.\nOur proposed algorithm reduces the average age by approximately $25\\%$ and\nrequires down to $50\\%$ less energy when compared to the baseline scheme.",

However, since they decompose the scene into\nmultiple maps containing various objects, and they do not rely on any explicit\nsupervisory signal, they cannot distinguish between the object of interest from\nother objects, as required in weakly-supervised object localization (WSOL). To\naddress this issue, we propose leveraging the multiple maps generated by the\ndifferent transformer heads to acquire pseudo-labels for training a WSOL model.\nIn particular, a new Discriminative Proposals Sampling (DiPS) method is\nintroduced that relies on a pretrained CNN classifier to identify\ndiscriminative regions. Then, foreground and background pixels are sampled from\nthese regions in order to train a WSOL model for generating activation maps\nthat can accurately localize objects belonging to a specific class. Empirical\nresults on the challenging CUB, OpenImages, and ILSVRC benchmark datasets\nindicate that our proposed approach can outperform state-of-art methods over a\nwide range of threshold values.

    "abstract": "When training overparameterized deep networks for classification tasks, it\nhas been widely observed that the learned features exhibit a so-called \"neural\ncollapse\" phenomenon. More specifically, for the output features of the\npenultimate layer, for each class the within-class features converge to their\nmeans, and the means of different classes exhibit a certain tight frame\nstructure, which is also aligned with the last layer's classifier. As feature\nnormalization in the last layer becomes a common practice in modern\nrepresentation learning, in this work we theoretically justify the neural\ncollapse phenomenon for normalized features. Based on an unconstrained feature\nmodel, we simplify the empirical loss function in a multi-class classification\ntask into a nonconvex optimization problem over the Riemannian manifold by\nconstraining all features and classifiers over the sphere. In this context, we\nanalyze the nonconvex landscape of the Riemannian optimization problem over the\nproduct of spheres, showing a benign global landscape in the sense that the\nonly global minimizers are the neural collapse solutions while all other\ncritical points are strict saddles with negative curvature. Experimental\nresults on practical deep networks corroborate our theory and demonstrate that\nbetter representations can be learned faster via feature normalization.",

The ability to\nnaturally measure and monitor these contact forces allows a plethora of\napplications from warehouse management (detect faulty packages based on\nweights) to robotics (making a robotic arms' grip as sensitive as human skin)\nand healthcare (knee-implants). It is challenging to design a ubiquitous force\nsensor that can be used naturally for all these applications. First, the sensor\nshould be small enough to fit in narrow spaces. Next, we don't want to lay\ncumbersome cables to read the force values from the sensors. Finally, we need\nto have a battery-free design to meet the in-vivo applications. We develop\nWiForceSticker, a wireless, battery-free, sticker-like force sensor that can be\nubiquitously deployed on any surface, such as all warehouse packages, robotic\narms, and knee joints.

A good streaming recognition model captures both long-term\ndynamics and short-term changes of video. Unfortunately, in most existing\nmethods, the computational complexity grows linearly or quadratically with the\nlength of the considered dynamics. This issue is particularly pronounced in\ntransformer-based architectures. To address this issue, we reformulate the\ncross-attention in a video transformer through the lens of kernel and apply two\nkinds of temporal smoothing kernel: A box kernel or a Laplace kernel. The\nresulting streaming attention reuses much of the computation from frame to\nframe, and only requires a constant time update each frame.

Furthermore, thanks to the increased temporal\nspan, TeSTra achieves state-of-the-art results on THUMOS'14 and\nEPIC-Kitchen-100, two standard online action detection and action anticipation\ndatasets.

A curative treatment is\ncatheter ablation in order to inactivate the abnormally triggering regions. To\nfacilitate and expedite the localization during the ablation procedure, we\npresent two novel localization techniques based on convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs). In contrast to existing methods, e.g. using ECG imaging, our\napproaches were designed to be independent of the patient-specific geometries\nand directly applicable to surface ECG signals, while also delivering a binary\ntransmural position. One method outputs ranked alternative solutions. Results\ncan be visualized either on a generic or patient geometry. The CNNs were\ntrained on a data set containing only simulated data and evaluated both on\nsimulated and clinical test data. On simulated data, the median test error was\nbelow 3mm. The median localization error on the clinical data was as low as\n32mm. The transmural position was correctly detected in up to 82% of all\nclinical cases. Using the ranked alternative solutions, the top-3 median error\ndropped to 20mm on clinical data. These results demonstrate a proof of\nprinciple to utilize CNNs to localize the activation source without the\nintrinsic need of patient-specific geometrical information. Furthermore,\ndelivering multiple solutions can help the physician to find the real\nactivation source amongst more than one possible locations. With further\noptimization, these methods have a high potential to speed up clinical\ninterventions. Consequently they could decrease procedural risk and improve VT\npatients' outcomes.",

    "abstract": "An independent, automated method of decoding and transcribing oral speech is\nknown as automatic speech recognition (ASR). A typical ASR system extracts\nfeatured from audio recordings or streams and run one or more algorithms to map\nthe features to corresponding texts. Numerous of research has been done in the\nfield of speech signal processing in recent years. When given adequate\nresources, both conventional ASR and emerging end-to-end (E2E) speech\nrecognition have produced promising results. However, for low-resource\nlanguages like Bengali, the current state of ASR lags behind, although the low\nresource state does not reflect upon the fact that this language is spoken by\nover 500 million people all over the world. Despite its popularity, there\naren't many diverse open-source datasets available, which makes it difficult to\nconduct research on Bengali speech recognition systems. This paper is a part of\nthe competition named `BUET CSE Fest DL Sprint'. The purpose of this paper is\nto improve the speech recognition performance of the Bengali language by\nadopting speech recognition technology on the E2E structure based on the\ntransfer learning framework. The proposed method effectively models the Bengali\nlanguage and achieves 3.819 score in `Levenshtein Mean Distance' on the test\ndataset of 7747 samples, when only 1000 samples of train dataset were used to\ntrain.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid modeling combining data-driven techniques and numerical methods is an\nemerging and promising research direction for efficient climate simulation.\nHowever, previous works lack practical platforms, making developing hybrid\nmodeling a challenging programming problem. Furthermore, the lack of standard\ndata sets and evaluation metrics may hamper researchers from comprehensively\ncomparing various algorithms under a uniform condition. To address these\nproblems, we propose a framework called NeuroClim for hybrid modeling under the\nreal-world scenario, a basic setting to simulate the real climate that we live\nin. NeuroClim consists of three parts: (1) Platform. We develop a user-friendly\nplatform NeuroGCM for efficiently developing hybrid modeling in climate\nsimulation. (2) Dataset. We provide an open-source dataset for data-driven\nmethods in hybrid modeling. We investigate the characteristics of the data,\ni.e., heterogeneity and stiffness, which reveals the difficulty of regressing\nclimate simulation data; (3) Metrics. We propose a methodology for\nquantitatively evaluating hybrid modeling, including the approximation ability\nof machine learning models and the stability during simulation. We believe that\nNeuroClim allows researchers to work without high level of climate-related\nexpertise and focus only on machine learning algorithm design, which will\naccelerate hybrid modeling research in the AI-Climate intersection.

However, evaluating\nwhich form of KT extracts possesses AD properties similar to the standard AD\nfluoxetine (flu) remained challenging. Here, we adopted an autoencoder\n(AE)-based anomaly detector called ANet to measure the similarity of mice's\nlocal field potential (LFP) features that responded to KT leave extracts and AD\nflu. The features that responded to KT syrup had the highest similarity to\nthose that responded to the AD flu at 85.62 $\\pm$ 0.29%.

Apart from the similarity measurement, we utilized\nANet as a multi-task AE and evaluated the performance in discriminating\nmulti-class LFP responses corresponding to the effect of different KT extracts\nand AD flu simultaneously. Furthermore, we visualized learned latent features\namong LFP responses qualitatively and quantitatively as t-SNE projection and\nmaximum mean discrepancy distance, respectively.

    "abstract": "To achieve inclusive green growth, countries need to consider a multiplicity\nof economic, social, and environmental factors. These are often captured by\nmetrics of economic complexity derived from the geography of trade, thus\nmissing key information on innovative activities. To bridge this gap, we\ncombine trade data with data on patent applications and research publications\nto build models that significantly and robustly improve the ability of economic\ncomplexity metrics to explain international variations in inclusive green\ngrowth. We show that measures of complexity built on trade and patent data\ncombine to explain future economic growth and income inequality and that\ncountries that score high in all three metrics tend to exhibit lower emission\nintensities. These findings illustrate how the geography of trade, technology,\nand research combine to explain inclusive green growth.",

    "abstract": "Deployed machine learning (ML) models often encounter new user data that\ndiffers from their training data. Therefore, estimating how well a given model\nmight perform on the new data is an important step toward reliable ML\napplications. This is very challenging, however, as the data distribution can\nchange in flexible ways, and we may not have any labels on the new data, which\nis often the case in monitoring settings. In this paper, we propose a new\ndistribution shift model, Sparse Joint Shift (SJS), which considers the joint\nshift of both labels and a few features. This unifies and generalizes several\nexisting shift models including label shift and sparse covariate shift, where\nonly marginal feature or label distribution shifts are considered. We describe\nmathematical conditions under which SJS is identifiable. We further propose\nSEES, an algorithmic framework to characterize the distribution shift under SJS\nand to estimate a model's performance on new data without any labels. We\nconduct extensive experiments on several real-world datasets with various ML\nmodels. Across different datasets and distribution shifts, SEES achieves\nsignificant (up to an order of magnitude) shift estimation error improvements\nover existing approaches.",

    "abstract": "Recent experimental observations have shown that the reactivation of\nhippocampal place cells (PC) during sleep or immobility depicts trajectories\nthat can go around barriers and can flexibly adapt to a changing maze layout.\nSuch layout-conforming replay sheds a light on how the activity of place cells\nsupports the learning of flexible navigation of an animal in a dynamically\nchanging maze. However, existing computational models of replay fall short of\ngenerating layout-conforming replay, restricting their usage to simple\nenvironments, like linear tracks or open fields. In this paper, we propose a\ncomputational model that generates layout-conforming replay and explains how\nsuch replay drives the learning of flexible navigation in a maze. First, we\npropose a Hebbian-like rule to learn the inter-PC synaptic strength during\nexploring a maze. Then we use a continuous attractor network (CAN) with\nfeedback inhibition to model the interaction among place cells and hippocampal\ninterneurons. The activity bump of place cells drifts along a path in the maze,\nwhich models layout-conforming replay. During replay in rest, the synaptic\nstrengths from place cells to striatal medium spiny neurons (MSN) are learned\nby a novel dopamine-modulated three-factor rule to store place-reward\nassociations. During goal-directed navigation, the CAN periodically generates\nreplay trajectories from the animal's location for path planning, and the\ntrajectory leading to a maximal MSN activity is followed by the animal. We have\nimplemented our model into a high-fidelity virtual rat in the MuJoCo physics\nsimulator. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that its superior\nflexibility during navigation in a maze is due to a continuous re-learning of\ninter-PC and PC-MSN synaptic strength.",

Typically, a graph structure $G$ exists\nbehind local devices for communication. In this work, we consider parameter\nestimation in federated learning with data distribution and communication\nheterogeneity, as well as limited computational capacity of local devices. We\nencode the distribution heterogeneity by parametrizing distributions on local\ndevices with a set of distinct $p$-dimensional vectors. We then propose to\njointly estimate parameters of all devices under the $M$-estimation framework\nwith the fused Lasso regularization, encouraging an equal estimate of\nparameters on connected devices in $G$. We provide a general result for our\nestimator depending on $G$, which can be further calibrated to obtain\nconvergence rates for various specific problem setups.

    "abstract": "Objective: Parallel imaging accelerates the acquisition of magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI) data by acquiring additional sensitivity information with an\narray of receiver coils resulting in reduced phase encoding steps. Compressed\nsensing magnetic resonance imaging (CS-MRI) has achieved popularity in the\nfield of medical imaging because of its less data requirement than parallel\nimaging. Parallel imaging and compressed sensing (CS) both speed up traditional\nMRI acquisition by minimizing the amount of data captured in the k-space. As\nacquisition time is inversely proportional to the number of samples, the\ninverse formation of an image from reduced k-space samples leads to faster\nacquisition but with aliasing artifacts. This paper proposes a novel Generative\nAdversarial Network (GAN) namely RECGAN-GR supervised with multi-modal losses\nfor de-aliasing the reconstructed image. Methods: In contrast to existing GAN\nnetworks, our proposed method introduces a novel generator network namely\nRemU-Net integrated with dual-domain loss functions including weighted\nmagnitude and phase loss functions along with parallel imaging-based loss i.e.,\nGRAPPA consistency loss. A k-space correction block is proposed as refinement\nlearning to make the GAN network self-resistant to generating unnecessary data\nwhich drives the convergence of the reconstruction process faster. Results:\nComprehensive results show that the proposed RECGAN-GR achieves a 4 dB\nimprovement in the PSNR among the GAN-based methods and a 2 dB improvement\namong conventional state-of-the-art CNN methods available in the literature.\nConclusion and significance: The proposed work contributes to significant\nimprovement in the image quality for low retained data leading to 5x or 10x\nfaster acquisition.",

However, it has recently been observed that it is difficult to\ngeneralize the performance of neural networks under the condition of\ndistributional shift.

Although existing literature has made significant\nprogress with regard to images and textual data, finance has been overlooked.\nThe aim of this paper is to investigate the distribution shift in the credit\nscoring problem, one of the most important applications of finance.

As a second step, we utilize the domain\nknowledge with a mean-variance optimization in order to provide reliable bounds\nfor unconfident samples. Using empirical results, we demonstrate that our model\noffers reliable predictions for the vast majority of datasets. It is only a\nsmall portion of the dataset that is inherently difficult to judge, and we\nleave them to the judgment of human beings. Based on the two-stage model,\nhighly confident predictions have been made and potential risks associated with\nthe model have been significantly reduced.",

In the\npast few decades, causal inference has been well developed in many fields, such\nas computer science, medicine, economics, and education. With the advancement\nof deep learning techniques, it has been increasingly used in causal inference\nagainst counterfactual data.

    "abstract": "In the history of first-order algorithms, Nesterov's accelerated gradient\ndescent (NAG) is one of the milestones. However, the cause of the acceleration\nhas been a mystery for a long time. It has not been revealed with the existence\nof gradient correction until the high-resolution differential equation\nframework proposed in [Shi et al., 2021]. In this paper, we continue to\ninvestigate the acceleration phenomenon. First, we provide a significantly\nsimplified proof based on precise observation and a tighter inequality for\n$L$-smooth functions. Then, a new implicit-velocity high-resolution\ndifferential equation framework, as well as the corresponding implicit-velocity\nversion of phase-space representation and Lyapunov function, is proposed to\ninvestigate the convergence behavior of the iterative sequence\n$\\{x_k\\}_{k=0}^{\\infty}$ of NAG. Furthermore, from two kinds of phase-space\nrepresentations, we find that the role played by gradient correction is\nequivalent to that by velocity included implicitly in the gradient, where the\nonly difference comes from the iterative sequence $\\{y_{k}\\}_{k=0}^{\\infty}$\nreplaced by $\\{x_k\\}_{k=0}^{\\infty}$. Finally, for the open question of whether\nthe gradient norm minimization of NAG has a faster rate $o(1/k^3)$, we figure\nout a positive answer with its proof. Meanwhile, a faster rate of objective\nvalue minimization $o(1/k^2)$ is shown for the case $r > 2$.",

Such knowledge is used to increase performance as well as solution\nquality. In this paper, we propose an exact approach based on the\nbranch-and-cut technique to solve the cardinality-constrained MSSC. For the\nlower bound routine, we use the semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation\nrecently proposed by Rujeerapaiboon et al. [SIAM J. Optim. 29(2), 1211-1239,\n(2019)]. However, this relaxation can be used in a branch-and-cut method only\nfor small-size instances. Therefore, we derive a new SDP relaxation that scales\nbetter with the instance size and the number of clusters. In both cases, we\nstrengthen the bound by adding polyhedral cuts. Benefiting from a tailored\nbranching strategy which enforces pairwise constraints, we reduce the\ncomplexity of the problems arising in the children nodes. For the upper bound,\ninstead, we present a local search procedure that exploits the solution of the\nSDP relaxation solved at each node.

Then, defining a constructive sequent calculus as a\ncalculus consisting of constructive rules and some basic modal rules, we prove\nthat any constructive sequent calculus stronger than $\\mathbf{CK}$ satisfying a\nmild technical condition, feasibly admits all Visser's rules, i.e., there is a\npolynomial time algorithm that reads a proof of the premise of a Visser's rule\nand provides a proof for its conclusion.

Furthermore, we apply statistical learning methods to optimize\nthe woven composite architecture to improve mechanical responses. Our results\nshow that PCNN can effectively predict woven architecture for the desired\nmodulus with much higher accuracy than several baseline models. PCNN can be\nfurther combined with feature-based optimization to determine the optimal woven\ncomposite architecture at the initial design stage. In addition to relating\nwoven composite architecture to its mechanical responses, our research also\nprovides an in-depth understanding of how architectural features govern\nmechanical responses. We anticipate our proposed frameworks will primarily\nfacilitate the woven composite analysis and optimization process and be a\nstarting point to introduce Physics knowledge-guided Neural Networks into the\ncomplex structural analysis.",

    "abstract": "Studying the properties of stochastic noise to optimize complex non-convex\nfunctions has been an active area of research in the field of machine learning.\nPrior work has shown that the noise of stochastic gradient descent improves\noptimization by overcoming undesirable obstacles in the landscape. Moreover,\ninjecting artificial Gaussian noise has become a popular idea to quickly escape\nsaddle points. Indeed, in the absence of reliable gradient information, the\nnoise is used to explore the landscape, but it is unclear what type of noise is\noptimal in terms of exploration ability. In order to narrow this gap in our\nknowledge, we study a general type of continuous-time non-Markovian process,\nbased on fractional Brownian motion, that allows for the increments of the\nprocess to be correlated. This generalizes processes based on Brownian motion,\nsuch as the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We demonstrate how to discretize such\nprocesses which gives rise to the new algorithm fPGD. This method is a\ngeneralization of the known algorithms PGD and Anti-PGD. We study the\nproperties of fPGD both theoretically and empirically, demonstrating that it\npossesses exploration abilities that, in some cases, are favorable over PGD and\nAnti-PGD. These results open the field to novel ways to exploit noise for\ntraining machine learning models.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI) solutions for medical diagnosis require\nthorough evaluation to demonstrate that performance is maintained for all\npatient sub-groups and to ensure that proposed improvements in care will be\ndelivered equitably. This study evaluates the robustness of an AI solution for\nthe diagnosis of normal chest X-rays (CXRs) by comparing performance across\nmultiple patient and environmental subgroups, as well as comparing AI errors\nwith those made by human experts.\nMethods: A total of 4,060 CXRs were sampled to represent a diverse dataset of\nNHS patients and care settings. Ground-truth labels were assigned by a\n3-radiologist panel. AI performance was evaluated against assigned labels and\nsub-groups analysis was conducted against patient age and sex, as well as CXR\nview, modality, device manufacturer and hospital site.\nResults: The AI solution was able to remove 18.5% of the dataset by\nclassification as High Confidence Normal (HCN). This was associated with a\nnegative predictive value (NPV) of 96.0%, compared to 89.1% for diagnosis of\nnormal scans by radiologists. In all AI false negative (FN) cases, a\nradiologist was found to have also made the same error when compared to final\nground-truth labels. Subgroup analysis showed no statistically significant\nvariations in AI performance, whilst reduced normal classification was observed\nin data from some hospital sites.\nConclusion: We show the AI solution could provide meaningful workload savings\nby diagnosis of 18.5% of scans as HCN with a superior NPV to human readers. The\nAI solution is shown to perform well across patient subgroups and error cases\nwere shown to be subjective or subtle in nature.",

    "title": "Deep Variation Prior: Joint Image Denoising and Noise Variance  Estimation without Clean Data",
    "abstract": "With recent deep learning based approaches showing promising results in\nremoving noise from images, the best denoising performance has been reported in\na supervised learning setup that requires a large set of paired noisy images\nand ground truth for training. The strong data requirement can be mitigated by\nunsupervised learning techniques, however, accurate modelling of images or\nnoise variance is still crucial for high-quality solutions. The learning\nproblem is ill-posed for unknown noise distributions. This paper investigates\nthe tasks of image denoising and noise variance estimation in a single, joint\nlearning framework. To address the ill-posedness of the problem, we present\ndeep variation prior (DVP), which states that the variation of a properly\nlearnt denoiser with respect to the change of noise satisfies some smoothness\nproperties, as a key criterion for good denoisers. Building upon DVP, an\nunsupervised deep learning framework, that simultaneously learns a denoiser and\nestimates noise variances, is developed. Our method does not require any clean\ntraining images or an external step of noise estimation, and instead,\napproximates the minimum mean squared error denoisers using only a set of noisy\nimages. With the two underlying tasks being considered in a single framework,\nwe allow them to be optimised for each other. The experimental results show a\ndenoising quality comparable to that of supervised learning and accurate noise\nvariance estimates.",
