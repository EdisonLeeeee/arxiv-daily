    "abstract": "Text information including extensive prior knowledge about land cover classes\nhas been ignored in hyperspectral image classification (HSI) tasks. It is\nnecessary to explore the effectiveness of linguistic mode in assisting HSI\nclassification. In addition, the large-scale pre-training image-text foundation\nmodels have demonstrated great performance in a variety of downstream\napplications, including zero-shot transfer. However, most domain generalization\nmethods have never addressed mining linguistic modal knowledge to improve the\ngeneralization performance of model. To compensate for the inadequacies listed\nabove, a Language-aware Domain Generalization Network (LDGnet) is proposed to\nlearn cross-domain invariant representation from cross-domain shared prior\nknowledge. The proposed method only trains on the source domain (SD) and then\ntransfers the model to the target domain (TD). The dual-stream architecture\nincluding image encoder and text encoder is used to extract visual and\nlinguistic features, in which coarse-grained and fine-grained text\nrepresentations are designed to extract two levels of linguistic features.\nFurthermore, linguistic features are used as cross-domain shared semantic\nspace, and visual-linguistic alignment is completed by supervised contrastive\nlearning in semantic space. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate\nthe superiority of the proposed method when compared with state-of-the-art\ntechniques.",

    "abstract": "Clinical investigations of anatomy's structural changes over time could\ngreatly benefit from population-level quantification of shape, or\nspatiotemporal statistic shape modeling (SSM). Such a tool enables\ncharacterizing patient organ cycles or disease progression in relation to a\ncohort of interest. Constructing shape models requires establishing a\nquantitative shape representation (e.g., corresponding landmarks).\nParticle-based shape modeling (PSM) is a data-driven SSM approach that captures\npopulation-level shape variations by optimizing landmark placement. However, it\nassumes cross-sectional study designs and hence has limited statistical power\nin representing shape changes over time. Existing methods for modeling\nspatiotemporal or longitudinal shape changes require predefined shape atlases\nand pre-built shape models that are typically constructed cross-sectionally.\nThis paper proposes a data-driven approach inspired by the PSM method to learn\npopulation-level spatiotemporal shape changes directly from shape data. We\nintroduce a novel SSM optimization scheme that produces landmarks that are in\ncorrespondence both across the population (inter-subject) and across\ntime-series (intra-subject). We apply the proposed method to 4D cardiac data\nfrom atrial-fibrillation patients and demonstrate its efficacy in representing\nthe dynamic change of the left atrium. Furthermore, we show that our method\noutperforms an image-based approach for spatiotemporal SSM with respect to a\ngenerative time-series model, the Linear Dynamical System (LDS). LDS fit using\na spatiotemporal shape model optimized via our approach provides better\ngeneralization and specificity, indicating it accurately captures the\nunderlying time-dependency.",

The overall goal of the educate-the-educators curriculum was to\nenable CS faculty to creatively engage with embedding inclusive design into\ntheir courses in \"minimally invasive\" ways. GenderMag, an inclusive design\nevaluation method, was selected for use. The curriculum targeted the following\nlearning outcomes: to enable CS faculty: (1) to analyze the costs and benefits\nof integrating inclusive design into their own course(s); (2) to evaluate\nsoftware using the GenderMag method, and recognize its use to identify\nmeaningful issues in software; (3) to integrate inclusive design into existing\ncourse materials with provided resources and collaboration; and (4) to prepare\nto engage and guide students on learning GenderMag concepts. We conducted a\nfield study over a spring/summer followed by end-of-fall interviews, during\nwhich we worked with 18 faculty members to integrate inclusive design into 13\ncourses. Ten of these faculty then taught 7 of these courses that were on the\nFall 2021 schedule, across 16 sections.

Our results\nshowed that, of the 18 faculty we worked with, 83% chose to modify their\ncourses; by Fall 2021, faculty across all four years of a CS degree program had\nbegun teaching inclusive design concepts.

    "abstract": "Component-based synthesis seeks to build programs using the APIs provided by\na set of libraries. Oftentimes, these APIs have effects, which make it\nchallenging to reason about the correctness of potential synthesis candidates.\nThis is because changes to global state made by effectful library procedures\naffect how they may be composed together, yielding an intractably large search\nspace that can confound typical enumerative synthesis techniques. If the nature\nof these effects are exposed as part of their specification, however, deductive\nsynthesis approaches can be used to help guide the search for components. In\nthis paper, we present a new specification-guided synthesis procedure that uses\nHoare-style pre- and post-conditions to express fine-grained effects of\npotential library component candidates to drive a bi-directional synthesis\nsearch strategy. The procedure alternates between a forward search process that\nseeks to build larger terms given an existing context but which is otherwise\nunaware of the actual goal, alongside a backward search mechanism that seeks\nterms consistent with the desired goal but which is otherwise unaware of the\ncontext from which these terms must be synthesized. To further improve\nefficiency and scalability, we integrate a conflict-driven learning procedure\ninto the synthesis algorithm that provides a semantic characterization of\npreviously encountered unsuccessful search paths that is used to prune the\nspace of possible candidates as synthesis proceeds. We have implemented our\nideas in a tool called Cobalt and demonstrate its effectiveness on a number of\nchallenging synthesis problems defined over OCaml libraries equipped with\neffectful specifications.",

    "abstract": "Mobility plays a fundamental role in modern cities. How citizens experience\nthe city, access its core services, and participate in city life, strongly\ndepends on its mobility organization and efficiency. The challenges that\nmunicipalities face are very ambitious: on the one hand, administrators must\nguarantee their citizens the right to mobility and to easily access local\nservices; on the other hand, they need to minimize the economic, social, and\nenvironmental costs of the mobility system. Municipalities are increasingly\nfacing problems of traffic congestion, road safety, energy dependency and air\npollution, and therefore encouraging a shift towards sustainable mobility\nhabits based on active mobility is of central importance. Active modes, such as\ncycling, should be particularly encouraged, especially for local recurrent\njourneys (i.e., home-to-school, home-to-work). In this context, addressing and\nmitigating commuter-generated traffic requires engaging public and private\nstakeholders through innovative and collaborative approaches that focus not\nonly on supply (e.g., roads and vehicles) but also on transportation demand\nmanagement. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end solution for enabling urban\ncyclability. It supports the companies' Mobility Managers (MMs) acting on the\npromotion of active mobility for home-to-work commuting, helps the city\nadministrators to understand the needed urban planning interventions, and\nmotivates the citizens to sustainable mobility. To evaluate the effectiveness\nof the proposed solution we developed two analyses: the first to accurately\nanalyze the user experience and any behaviour change related to the BIKE2WORK\ninitiative, and the second to demonstrate how exploiting the collected data we\ncan inform and possible guide the involved municipality (i.e., Ferrara, a city\nin Northern Italy) in improving the urban cyclability.",

The premium should then be some function\nof these three values. We focus on risk assessment using a Data Science\napproach. Instead of using the traditional frequency and severity metrics we\ninstead predict the total claims that will be made by a new customer using\nhistorical data of current and past policies. Given multiple features of the\npolicy (age and gender of drivers, value of car, previous accidents, etc.) one\ncan potentially try to provide personalized insurance policies based\nspecifically on these features as follows. We can compute the average claims\nmade per year of all past and current policies with identical features and then\ntake an average over these claim rates. Unfortunately there may not be\nsufficient samples to obtain a robust average. We can instead try to include\npolicies that are \"similar\" to obtain sufficient samples for a robust average.\nWe therefore face a trade-off between personalization (only using closely\nsimilar policies) and robustness (extending the domain far enough to capture\nsufficient samples). This is known as the Bias-Variance Trade-off. We model\nthis problem and determine the optimal trade-off between the two (i.e. the\nbalance that provides the highest prediction accuracy) and apply it to the\nclaim rate prediction problem.

    "abstract": "As complex machine learning models are increasingly used in sensitive\napplications like banking, trading or credit scoring, there is a growing demand\nfor reliable explanation mechanisms. Local feature attribution methods have\nbecome a popular technique for post-hoc and model-agnostic explanations.\nHowever, attribution methods typically assume a stationary environment in which\nthe predictive model has been trained and remains stable. As a result, it is\noften unclear how local attributions behave in realistic, constantly evolving\nsettings such as streaming and online applications. In this paper, we discuss\nthe impact of temporal change on local feature attributions. In particular, we\nshow that local attributions can become obsolete each time the predictive model\nis updated or concept drift alters the data generating distribution.\nConsequently, local feature attributions in data streams provide high\nexplanatory power only when combined with a mechanism that allows us to detect\nand respond to local changes over time. To this end, we present CDLEEDS, a\nflexible and model-agnostic framework for detecting local change and concept\ndrift. CDLEEDS serves as an intuitive extension of attribution-based\nexplanation techniques to identify outdated local attributions and enable more\ntargeted recalculations. In experiments, we also show that the proposed\nframework can reliably detect both local and global concept drift.

Our results show that, in CF-mMIMO,\ndownlink training is preferable over statistical CSI when the length of the\ndata sequence is chosen optimally to maximize the spectral efficiency. In\ncellular mMIMO, however, either one of the two schemes may be better depending\non whether user fairness or sum spectral efficiency is prioritized.\nFurthermore, the CF-mMIMO system generally outperforms cellular mMIMO even\nafter accounting for the effects of channel aging and pilot contamination.\nThrough numerical results, we illustrate the effect of various system\nparameters such as the maximum user velocity, uplink/downlink pilot lengths,\ndata duration, network densification, and provide interesting insights into the\nkey differences between cell-free and cellular mMIMO systems.",

    "abstract": "We study a modular approach to tackle long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks\nfor object rearrangement, which decomposes a full task into a sequence of\nsubtasks. To tackle the entire task, prior work chains multiple stationary\nmanipulation skills with a point-goal navigation skill, which are learned\nindividually on subtasks. Although more effective than monolithic end-to-end RL\npolicies, this framework suffers from compounding errors in skill chaining,\ne.g., navigating to a bad location where a stationary manipulation skill can\nnot reach its target to manipulate. To this end, we propose that the\nmanipulation skills should include mobility to have flexibility in interacting\nwith the target object from multiple locations and at the same time the\nnavigation skill could have multiple end points which lead to successful\nmanipulation. We operationalize these ideas by implementing mobile manipulation\nskills rather than stationary ones and training a navigation skill trained with\nregion goal instead of point goal. We evaluate our multi-skill mobile\nmanipulation method M3 on 3 challenging long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks\nin the Home Assistant Benchmark (HAB), and show superior performance as\ncompared to the baselines.",

    "abstract": "People have expectations about how colors map to concepts in visualizations,\nand they are better at interpreting visualizations that match their\nexpectations. Traditionally, studies on these expectations (inferred mappings)\ndistinguished distinct factors relevant for visualizations of categorical vs.\ncontinuous information. Studies on categorical information focused on direct\nassociations (e.g., mangos are associated with yellows) whereas studies on\ncontinuous information focused on relational associations (e.g., darker colors\nmap to larger quantities; dark-is-more bias). We unite these two areas within a\nsingle framework of assignment inference. Assignment inference is the process\nby which people infer mappings between perceptual features and concepts\nrepresented in encoding systems. Observers infer globally optimal assignments\nby maximizing the \"merit,\" or \"goodness,\" of each possible assignment. Previous\nwork on assignment inference focused on visualizations of categorical\ninformation. We extend this approach to visualizations of continuous data by\n(a) broadening the notion of merit to include relational associations and (b)\ndeveloping a method for combining multiple (sometimes conflicting) sources of\nmerit to predict people's inferred mappings. We developed and tested our model\non data from experiments in which participants interpreted colormap data\nvisualizations, representing fictitious data about environmental concepts\n(sunshine, shade, wild fire, ocean water, glacial ice). We found both direct\nand relational associations contribute independently to inferred mappings.\nThese results can be used to optimize visualization design to facilitate visual\ncommunication.",

Drawing inspiration from biology, where reaching control\nnetworks give rise to smooth and precise movements, can narrow the performance\ngap between human and robot control. Neuromorphic processors, which mimic the\nbrain's computational principles, are an ideal platform to approximate the\naccuracy and smoothness of such controllers while maximizing their energy\nefficiency and robustness. However, the incompatibility of conventional control\nmethods with neuromorphic hardware limits the computational efficiency and\nexplainability of their existing adaptations. In contrast, the neuronal\nconnectome underlying smooth and accurate reaching movements is effective,\nminimal, and inherently compatible with neuromorphic processors. In this work,\nwe emulate these networks and propose a biologically realistic spiking neural\nnetwork for motor control. Our controller incorporates adaptive feedback to\nprovide smooth and accurate motor control while inheriting the minimal\ncomplexity of its biological counterpart that controls reaching movements,\nallowing for direct deployment on Intel's neuromorphic processor. Using our\ncontroller as a building block and inspired by joint coordination in human\narms, we scaled up our approach to control real-world robot arms. The\ntrajectories and smooth, minimum-jerk velocity profiles of the resulting\nmotions resembled those of humans, verifying the biological relevance of our\ncontroller. Notably, our method achieved state-of-the-art control performance\nwhile decreasing the motion jerk by 19\\% to improve motion smoothness.

As we will show, the easy\navailability of ML algorithms and lack of expertise on their proper use among\nthe anthropological research community has led to foundational misapplications\nthat have appeared throughout the literature. The resulting unreliable results\nnot only undermine efforts to legitimately incorporate ML into anthropological\nresearch, but produce potentially faulty understandings about our human\nevolutionary and behavioral past.\nThe aim of this paper is to provide a brief introduction to some of the ways\nin which ML has been applied within paleoanthropology; we also include a survey\nof some basic ML algorithms for those who are not fully conversant with the\nfield, which remains under active development.

Learning problems can be formulated as\nconstrained stochastic optimization problems, with the constraints originating\nmainly from model assumptions that define a trade-off between complexity and\nperformance. This trade-off is closely related to over-fitting, generalization\ncapacity, and robustness to noise and adversarial attacks, and depends on both\nthe structure and complexity of the model, as well as the properties of the\noptimization methods used. We develop an online prototype-based learning\nalgorithm based on annealing optimization that is formulated as an online\ngradient-free stochastic approximation algorithm. The learning model can be\nviewed as an interpretable and progressively growing competitive-learning\nneural network model to be used for supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement\nlearning. The annealing nature of the algorithm contributes to minimal\nhyper-parameter tuning requirements, poor local minima prevention, and\nrobustness with respect to the initial conditions. At the same time, it\nprovides online control over the performance-complexity trade-off by\nprogressively increasing the complexity of the learning model as needed,\nthrough an intuitive bifurcation phenomenon. Finally, the use of stochastic\napproximation enables the study of the convergence of the learning algorithm\nthrough mathematical tools from dynamical systems and control, and allows for\nits integration with reinforcement learning algorithms, constructing an\nadaptive state-action aggregation scheme.",

    "abstract": "Sketches make an intuitive and powerful visual expression as they are fast\nexecuted freehand drawings. We present a method for synthesizing realistic\nphotos from scene sketches. Without the need for sketch and photo pairs, our\nframework directly learns from readily available large-scale photo datasets in\nan unsupervised manner. To this end, we introduce a standardization module that\nprovides pseudo sketch-photo pairs during training by converting photos and\nsketches to a standardized domain, i.e. the edge map. The reduced domain gap\nbetween sketch and photo also allows us to disentangle them into two\ncomponents: holistic scene structures and low-level visual styles such as color\nand texture. Taking this advantage, we synthesize a photo-realistic image by\ncombining the structure of a sketch and the visual style of a reference photo.\nExtensive experimental results on perceptual similarity metrics and human\nperceptual studies show the proposed method could generate realistic photos\nwith high fidelity from scene sketches and outperform state-of-the-art photo\nsynthesis baselines. We also demonstrate that our framework facilitates a\ncontrollable manipulation of photo synthesis by editing strokes of\ncorresponding sketches, delivering more fine-grained details than previous\napproaches that rely on region-level editing.",

    "abstract": "Internet usage has changed from its first design. Hence, the current Internet\nmust cope with some limitations, including performance degradation,\navailability of IP addresses, and multiple security and privacy issues.\nNevertheless, to unsettle the current Internet's network layer i.e., Internet\nProtocol with ICN is a challenging, expensive task.

Additionally, history showed that technology changes e.g., from 3G to\n4G, from IPv4 to IPv6 are not immediate, and usually, the replacement includes\na long coexistence period between the old and new technology. Similarly, we\nbelieve that the process of replacement of the current Internet will surely\ntransition through the coexistence of IP and ICN. Although the tremendous\namount of security and privacy issues of the current Internet taught us the\nimportance of securely designing the architectures, only a few of the proposed\narchitectures place the security-by-design. Therefore, this article aims to\nprovide the first comprehensive Security and Privacy analysis of the\nstate-of-the-art coexistence architectures. Additionally, it yields a\nhorizontal comparison of security and privacy among three deployment approaches\nof IP and ICN protocol i.e., overlay, underlay, and hybrid and a vertical\ncomparison among ten considered security and privacy features. As a result of\nour analysis, emerges that most of the architectures utterly fail to provide\nseveral SP features including data and traffic flow confidentiality,\navailability and communication anonymity.

Specifically, the agents use the conditional value at risk (CVaR) as a\nrisk measure and rely on bandit feedback in the form of the cost values of the\nselected actions at every episode to estimate their CVaR values and update\ntheir actions. A major challenge in using bandit feedback to estimate CVaR is\nthat the agents can only access their own cost values, which, however, depend\non the actions of all agents. To address this challenge, we propose a new\nrisk-averse learning algorithm with momentum that utilizes the full historical\ninformation on the cost values.

Moving sensors such as Connected Vehicles (CVs) offer a relatively\ncheap alternative to measure traffic states across the network. Moving forward\nit is thus important to develop such models that effectively use the data from\nCVs. One such model is the nonlinear second-order Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) model\nwhich is a realistic traffic model, reliable for TSE and control. A state-space\nformulation is presented for the ARZ model considering junctions in the\nformulation which is important to model real highways with ramps. Linear\napproximation of the state-space model is investigated with respect to two\ntechniques, first-order Taylor series approximation and Carleman linearization.\nA Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) implementation is presented for TSE using a\nlinearized ARZ model. Various state-estimation techniques used for TSE in the\nliterature along with the presented approach are compared with regard to\naccuracy, computational tractability and parameter tuning with the help of a\ncase study using the VISSIM traffic simulation software.

    "abstract": "In reinforcement learning, Monte Carlo algorithms update the Q function by\naveraging the episodic returns. In the Monte Carlo UCB (MC-UCB) algorithm, the\naction taken in each state is the action that maximizes the Q function plus a\nUCB exploration term, which biases the choice of actions to those that have\nbeen chosen less frequently. Although there has been significant work on\nestablishing regret bounds for MC-UCB, most of that work has been focused on\nfinite-horizon versions of the problem, for which each episode terminates after\na constant number of steps. For such finite-horizon problems, the optimal\npolicy depends both on the current state and the time within the episode.\nHowever, for many natural episodic problems, such as games like Go and Chess\nand robotic tasks, the episode is of random length and the optimal policy is\nstationary. For such environments, it is an open question whether the\nQ-function in MC-UCB will converge to the optimal Q function; we conjecture\nthat, unlike Q-learning, it does not converge for all MDPs. We nevertheless\nshow that for a large class of MDPs, which includes stochastic MDPs such as\nblackjack and deterministic MDPs such as Go, the Q-function in MC-UCB converges\nalmost surely to the optimal Q function. An immediate corollary of this result\nis that it also converges almost surely for all finite-horizon MDPs. We also\nprovide numerical experiments, providing further insights into MC-UCB.",

    "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) compression is crucial to deploying\nthese models in edge devices with limited resources. Existing channel pruning\nalgorithms for CNNs have achieved plenty of success on complex models. They\napproach the pruning problem from various perspectives and use different\nmetrics to guide the pruning process. However, these metrics mainly focus on\nthe model's `outputs' or `weights' and neglect its `interpretations'\ninformation. To fill in this gap, we propose to address the channel pruning\nproblem from a novel perspective by leveraging the interpretations of a model\nto steer the pruning process, thereby utilizing information from both inputs\nand outputs of the model. However, existing interpretation methods cannot get\ndeployed to achieve our goal as either they are inefficient for pruning or may\npredict non-coherent explanations. We tackle this challenge by introducing a\nselector model that predicts real-time smooth saliency masks for pruned models.\nWe parameterize the distribution of explanatory masks by Radial Basis Function\n(RBF)-like functions to incorporate geometric prior of natural images in our\nselector model's inductive bias. Thus, we can obtain compact representations of\nexplanations to reduce the computational costs of our pruning method. We\nleverage our selector model to steer the network pruning by maximizing the\nsimilarity of explanatory representations for the pruned and original models.\nExtensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthe efficacy of our proposed method.

The lack of\ndatasets has impeded research on this topic as previous work has only been able\nto train and evaluate models on a few minutes of choral music data due to\ncopyright issues and dataset collection difficulties. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the use of synthesized training data for the source separation task\non real choral music. We make three contributions: first, we provide an\nautomated pipeline for synthesizing choral music data from sampled instrument\nplugins within controllable options for instrument expressiveness. This\nproduces an 8.2-hour-long choral music dataset from the JSB Chorales Dataset\nand one can easily synthesize additional data. Second, we conduct an experiment\nto evaluate multiple separation models on available choral music separation\ndatasets from previous work. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nexperiment to comprehensively evaluate choral music separation. Third,\nexperiments demonstrate that the synthesized choral data is of sufficient\nquality to improve the model's performance on real choral music datasets.

    "abstract": "Recent neuroimaging studies that focus on predicting brain disorders via\nmodern machine learning approaches commonly include a single modality and rely\non supervised over-parameterized models.However, a single modality provides\nonly a limited view of the highly complex brain. Critically, supervised models\nin clinical settings lack accurate diagnostic labels for training. Coarse\nlabels do not capture the long-tailed spectrum of brain disorder phenotypes,\nwhich leads to a loss of generalizability of the model that makes them less\nuseful in diagnostic settings. This work presents a novel multi-scale\ncoordinated framework for learning multiple representations from multimodal\nneuroimaging data. We propose a general taxonomy of informative inductive\nbiases to capture unique and joint information in multimodal self-supervised\nfusion. The taxonomy forms a family of decoder-free models with reduced\ncomputational complexity and a propensity to capture multi-scale relationships\nbetween local and global representations of the multimodal inputs. We conduct a\ncomprehensive evaluation of the taxonomy using functional and structural\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data across a spectrum of Alzheimer's disease\nphenotypes and show that self-supervised models reveal disorder-relevant brain\nregions and multimodal links without access to the labels during pre-training.\nThe proposed multimodal self-supervised learning yields representations with\nimproved classification performance for both modalities. The concomitant rich\nand flexible unsupervised deep learning framework captures complex multimodal\nrelationships and provides predictive performance that meets or exceeds that of\na more narrow supervised classification analysis. We present elaborate\nquantitative evidence of how this framework can significantly advance our\nsearch for missing links in complex brain disorders.",

In compiler implementation, reduction in sparse-dense hybrid\nalgebra plays a key role in performance. Though GPU provides various reduction\nsemantics that can better utilize the parallel computing and memory bandwidth\ncapacity, the central question is: how to elevate the flexible reduction\nsemantics to sparse compilation theory that assumes serial execution.\nSpecifically, we have to tackle two main challenges: (1) there are wasted\nparallelism by adopting static synchronization granularity (2) static reduction\nstrategy limits optimization space exploration. We propose Sgap: segment group\nand atomic parallelism to solve these problems. Atomic parallelism captures the\nflexible reduction semantics to systematically analyze the optimization space\nof sparse-dense hybrid algebra on GPU. It is a new optimization technique\nbeyond current compiler-based and open-source runtime libraries. Segment group\nelevates the flexible reduction semantics to suitable levels of abstraction in\nthe sparse compilation theory.

Finally, we\nuse GPU sparse matrix-matrix multiplication (SpMM) on the TACO compiler as a\nuse case to demonstrate the effectiveness of segment group in reduction\nsemantics elevation. We achieve up to 1.2x speedup over the original TACO's\nSpMM kernels. We also apply new optimization techniques found by atomic\nparallelism to an open-source state-of-the-art SpMM library dgSPARSE.

    "abstract": "Video anomaly detection aims to find the events in a video that do not\nconform to the expected behavior. The prevalent methods mainly detect anomalies\nby snippet reconstruction or future frame prediction error. However, the error\nis highly dependent on the local context of the current snippet and lacks the\nunderstanding of normality. To address this issue, we propose to detect\nanomalous events not only by the local context, but also according to the\nconsistency between the testing event and the knowledge about normality from\nthe training data. Concretely, we propose a novel two-stream framework based on\ncontext recovery and knowledge retrieval, where the two streams can complement\neach other. For the context recovery stream, we propose a spatiotemporal U-Net\nwhich can fully utilize the motion information to predict the future frame.\nFurthermore, we propose a maximum local error mechanism to alleviate the\nproblem of large recovery errors caused by complex foreground objects. For the\nknowledge retrieval stream, we propose an improved learnable locality-sensitive\nhashing, which optimizes hash functions via a Siamese network and a mutual\ndifference loss. The knowledge about normality is encoded and stored in hash\ntables, and the distance between the testing event and the knowledge\nrepresentation is used to reveal the probability of anomaly. Finally, we fuse\nthe anomaly scores from the two streams to detect anomalies. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness and complementarity of the two\nstreams, whereby the proposed two-stream framework achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on four datasets.",

However, limited knowledge is established to\nsupport international migrants who need to survive a crisis in their host\ncountries. The current paper presents an interview study with two cohorts of\nChinese migrants living in Japan (N=14) and the United States (N=14).\nParticipants reflected on their information seeking experiences during the\nCOVID pandemic. The reflection was supplemented by two weeks of self-tracking\nwhere participants maintained records of their COVIDrelated information seeking\npractice. Our data indicated that participants often took language detours, or\nvisits to Mandarin resources for information about the COVID outbreak in their\nhost countries. They also made strategic use of the Mandarin information to\nperform selective reading, cross-checking, and contextualized interpretation of\nCOVID-related information in Japanese or English. While such practices enhanced\nparticipants' perceived effectiveness of COVID-related information gathering\nand sensemaking, they disadvantaged people through sometimes incognizant ways.\nFurther, participants lacked the awareness or preference to review\nmigrant-oriented information that was issued by the host country's public\nauthorities despite its availability. Building upon these findings, we\ndiscussed solutions to improve international migrants' COVID-related\ninformation seeking in their non-native language and cultural environment. We\nadvocated inclusive crisis infrastructures that would engage people with\ndiverse levels of local language fluency, information literacy, and experience\nin leveraging public services.",

    "abstract": "Many real-world problems can be formulated as the alignment between two\ngeometric patterns. Previously, a great amount of research focus on the\nalignment of 2D or 3D patterns in the field of computer vision. Recently, the\nalignment problem in high dimensions finds several novel applications in\npractice. However, the research is still rather limited in the algorithmic\naspect. To the best of our knowledge, most existing approaches are just simple\nextensions of their counterparts for 2D and 3D cases, and often suffer from the\nissues such as high computational complexities. In this paper, we propose an\neffective framework to compress the high dimensional geometric patterns. Any\nexisting alignment method can be applied to the compressed geometric patterns\nand the time complexity can be significantly reduced. Our idea is inspired by\nthe observation that high dimensional data often has a low intrinsic dimension.\nOur framework is a \"data-dependent\" approach that has the complexity depending\non the intrinsic dimension of the input data. Our experimental results reveal\nthat running the alignment algorithm on compressed patterns can achieve similar\nqualities, comparing with the results on the original patterns, but the\nruntimes (including the times cost for compression) are substantially lower.",

    "abstract": "Global teams frequently consist of language-based subgroups who put together\ncomplementary information to achieve common goals. Previous research outlines a\ntwo-step work communication flow in these teams. There are team meetings using\na required common language (i.e., English); in preparation for those meetings,\npeople have subgroup conversations in their native languages. Work\ncommunication at team meetings is often less effective than in subgroup\nconversations. In the current study, we investigate the idea of leveraging\nmachine translation (MT) to facilitate global team meetings. We hypothesize\nthat exchanging subgroup conversation logs before a team meeting offers\ncontextual information that benefits teamwork at the meeting. MT can translate\nthese logs, which enables comprehension at a low cost. To test our hypothesis,\nwe conducted a between-subjects experiment where twenty quartets of\nparticipants performed a personnel selection task. Each quartet included two\nEnglish native speakers (NS) and two non-native speakers (NNS) whose native\nlanguage was Mandarin. All participants began the task with subgroup\nconversations in their native languages, then proceeded to team meetings in\nEnglish. We manipulated the exchange of subgroup conversation logs prior to\nteam meetings: with MT-mediated exchanges versus without. Analysis of\nparticipants' subjective experience, task performance, and depth of discussions\nas reflected through their conversational moves jointly indicates that team\nmeeting quality improved when there were MT-mediated exchanges of subgroup\nconversation logs as opposed to no exchanges. We conclude with reflections on\nwhen and how MT could be applied to enhance global teamwork across a language\nbarrier.",

To the best of our knowledge, existing studies mainly focus on\nnetwork alignment at the individual user level, requiring abundant common\ninformation between shared individual users. For the networks that cannot meet\nsuch requirements, social community structures actually provide complementary\nand critical information at a slightly coarse-grained level, alignment of which\nwill provide additional information for user alignment. In turn, user alignment\nalso reveals more clues for community alignment. Hence, in this paper, we\nintroduce the problem of joint social network alignment, which aims to align\nusers and communities across social networks simultaneously. Key challenges lie\nin that 1) how to learn the representations of both users and communities, and\n2) how to make user alignment and community alignment benefit from each other.\nTo address these challenges, we first elaborate on the characteristics of\nreal-world networks with the notion of delta-hyperbolicity, and show the\nsuperiority of hyperbolic space for representing social networks. Then, we\npresent a novel hyperbolic embedding approach for the joint social network\nalignment, referred to as PERFECT, in a unified optimization.

We propose a new model to measure the engagement of\nusers with topics discussed on social media based on interactions with social\nmedia posts. This model overcomes the limitations of previous volume and\nsentiment based approaches. We use this model to estimate engagement\ncoefficients for 48 cryptocurrencies created between 2019 and 2021 using data\nfrom Twitter from the first month of the cryptocurrencies' existence. We find\nthat the future returns of the cryptocurrencies are dependent on the engagement\ncoefficients. Cryptocurrencies whose engagement coefficients are too low or too\nhigh have lower returns. Low engagement coefficients signal a lack of interest,\nwhile high engagement coefficients signal artificial activity which is likely\nfrom automated accounts known as bots. We measure the amount of bot posts for\nthe cryptocurrencies and find that generally, cryptocurrencies with more bot\nposts have lower future returns. While future returns are dependent on both the\nbot activity and engagement coefficient, the dependence is strongest for the\nengagement coefficient, especially for short-term returns. We show that simple\ninvestment strategies which select cryptocurrencies with engagement\ncoefficients exceeding a fixed threshold perform well for holding times of a\nfew months.",

Yet, their validity is questionable because the clusterings they\npromote can sometimes be meaningless. External measures, on the other hand,\ncompare the algorithms' outputs to the reference, ground truth groupings that\nare provided by experts. The commonly-used classical partition similarity\nscores, such as the normalised mutual information, Fowlkes-Mallows, or adjusted\nRand index, might not possess all the desirable properties, e.g., they do not\nidentify pathological edge cases correctly. Furthermore, they are not nicely\ninterpretable: it is hard to say what a score of 0.8 really means. Its\nbehaviour might also vary as the number of true clusters changes.

    "abstract": "We increasingly rely on digital services and the conveniences they provide.\nProcessing of personal data is integral to such services and thus privacy and\ndata protection are a growing concern, and governments have responded with\nregulations such as the EU's GDPR. Following this, organisations that make\nsoftware have legal obligations to document the privacy and data protection of\ntheir software. This work must involve both software developers that understand\nthe code and the organisation's data protection officer or legal department\nthat understands privacy and the requirements of a Data Protection and Impact\nAssessment (DPIA).\nTo help developers and non-technical people such as lawyers document the\nprivacy and data protection behaviour of software, we have developed an\nautomatic software analysis technique. This technique is based on static\nprogram analysis to characterise the flow of privacy-related data. The results\nof the analysis can be presented as a graph of privacy flows and operations --\nthat is understandable also for non-technical people. We argue that our\ntechnique facilitates collaboration between technical and non-technical people\nin documenting the privacy behaviour of the software. We explain how to use the\nresults produced by our technique to answer a series of privacy-relevant\nquestions needed for a DPIA. To illustrate our work, we show both detailed and\nabstract analysis results from applying our analysis technique to the secure\nmessaging service Signal and to the client of the cloud service NextCloud and\nshow how their privacy flow-graphs inform the writing of a DPIA.",

    "abstract": "Pattern matching can be used to calculate the support of patterns, and is a\nkey issue in sequential pattern mining (or sequence pattern mining).\nNonoverlapping pattern matching means that two occurrences cannot use the same\ncharacter in the sequence at the same position. Approximate pattern matching\nallows for some data noise, and is more general than exact pattern matching. At\npresent, nonoverlapping approximate pattern matching is based on Hamming\ndistance, which cannot be used to measure the local approximation between the\nsubsequence and pattern, resulting in large deviations in matching results. To\ntackle this issue, we present a Nonoverlapping Delta and gamma approximate\nPattern matching (NDP) scheme that employs the (delta, gamma)-distance to give\nan approximate pattern matching, where the local and the global distances do\nnot exceed delta and gamma, respectively. We first transform the NDP problem\ninto a local approximate Nettree and then construct an efficient algorithm,\ncalled the local approximate Nettree for NDP (NetNDP). We propose a new\napproach called the Minimal Root Distance which allows us to determine whether\nor not a node has root paths that satisfy the global constraint and to prune\ninvalid nodes and parent-child relationships. NetNDP finds the rightmost\nabsolute leaf of the max root, searches for the rightmost occurrence from the\nrightmost absolute leaf, and deletes this occurrence. We iterate the above\nsteps until there are no new occurrences. Numerous experiments are used to\nverify the performance of the proposed algorithm.",

Thus,\nstate-of-the-art frameworks for monocular 360 depth estimation such as\nbi-projection fusion in BiFuse are proposed. To train such a framework, a large\nnumber of panoramas along with the corresponding depth ground truths captured\nby laser sensors are required, which highly increases the cost of data\ncollection. Moreover, since such a data collection procedure is time-consuming,\nthe scalability of extending these methods to different scenes becomes a\nchallenge. To this end, self-training a network for monocular depth estimation\nfrom 360 videos is one way to alleviate this issue. However, there are no\nexisting frameworks that incorporate bi-projection fusion into the\nself-training scheme, which highly limits the self-supervised performance since\nbi-projection fusion can leverage information from different projection types.\nIn this paper, we propose BiFuse++ to explore the combination of bi-projection\nfusion and the self-training scenario. To be specific, we propose a new fusion\nmodule and Contrast-Aware Photometric Loss to improve the performance of BiFuse\nand increase the stability of self-training on real-world videos.

In this paper, we\nfocus on a new weakly-supervised SOD task under hybrid labels, where the\nsupervision labels include a large number of coarse labels generated by the\ntraditional unsupervised method and a small number of real labels. To address\nthe issues of label noise and quantity imbalance in this task, we design a new\npipeline framework with three sophisticated training strategies. In terms of\nmodel framework, we decouple the task into label refinement sub-task and\nsalient object detection sub-task, which cooperate with each other and train\nalternately. Specifically, the R-Net is designed as a two-stream\nencoder-decoder model equipped with Blender with Guidance and Aggregation\nMechanisms (BGA), aiming to rectify the coarse labels for more reliable\npseudo-labels, while the S-Net is a replaceable SOD network supervised by the\npseudo labels generated by the current R-Net. Note that, we only need to use\nthe trained S-Net for testing. Moreover, in order to guarantee the\neffectiveness and efficiency of network training, we design three training\nstrategies, including alternate iteration mechanism, group-wise incremental\nmechanism, and credibility verification mechanism.

Weighted loss is one of the most popular ways of mitigating this\nissue, and a recent work has suggested that class-difficulty might be a better\nclue than conventionally used class-frequency to decide the distribution of\nweights. A heuristic formulation was used in the previous work for quantifying\nthe difficulty, but we empirically find that the optimal formulation varies\ndepending on the characteristics of datasets. Therefore, we propose\nDifficulty-Net, which learns to predict the difficulty of classes using the\nmodel's performance in a meta-learning framework. To make it learn reasonable\ndifficulty of a class within the context of other classes, we newly introduce\ntwo key concepts, namely the relative difficulty and the driver loss. The\nformer helps Difficulty-Net take other classes into account when calculating\ndifficulty of a class, while the latter is indispensable for guiding the\nlearning to a meaningful direction.

However, building an effective text\nnormalization solution for a real-world TTS system face two main challenges:\n(1) the semantic ambiguity of non-standard words (NSWs), e.g., numbers, dates,\nranges, scores, abbreviations, and (2) transforming NSWs into pronounceable\nsyllables, such as URL, email address, hashtag, and contact name. In this\npaper, we propose a new two-phase normalization approach to deal with these\nchallenges. First, a model-based tagger is designed to detect NSWs. Then,\ndepending on NSW types, a rule-based normalizer expands those NSWs into their\nfinal verbal forms. We conducted three empirical experiments for NSW detection\nusing Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), BiLSTM-CNN-CRF, and BERT-BiGRU-CRF\nmodels on a manually annotated dataset including 5819 sentences extracted from\nVietnamese news articles. In the second phase, we propose a forward\nlexicon-based maximum matching algorithm to split down the hashtag, email, URL,\nand contact name. The experimental results of the tagging phase show that the\naverage F1 scores of the BiLSTM-CNN-CRF and CRF models are above 90.00%,\nreaching the highest F1 of 95.00% with the BERT-BiGRU-CRF model.

    "abstract": "For years, the YOLO series has been the de facto industry-level standard for\nefficient object detection. The YOLO community has prospered overwhelmingly to\nenrich its use in a multitude of hardware platforms and abundant scenarios. In\nthis technical report, we strive to push its limits to the next level, stepping\nforward with an unwavering mindset for industry application.\nConsidering the diverse requirements for speed and accuracy in the real\nenvironment, we extensively examine the up-to-date object detection\nadvancements either from industry or academia. Specifically, we heavily\nassimilate ideas from recent network design, training strategies, testing\ntechniques, quantization, and optimization methods. On top of this, we\nintegrate our thoughts and practice to build a suite of deployment-ready\nnetworks at various scales to accommodate diversified use cases. With the\ngenerous permission of YOLO authors, we name it YOLOv6. We also express our\nwarm welcome to users and contributors for further enhancement. For a glimpse\nof performance, our YOLOv6-N hits 35.9% AP on the COCO dataset at a throughput\nof 1234 FPS on an NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPU. YOLOv6-S strikes 43.5% AP at 495 FPS,\noutperforming other mainstream detectors at the same scale~(YOLOv5-S, YOLOX-S,\nand PPYOLOE-S). Our quantized version of YOLOv6-S even brings a new\nstate-of-the-art 43.3% AP at 869 FPS. Furthermore, YOLOv6-M/L also achieves\nbetter accuracy performance (i.e., 49.5%/52.3%) than other detectors with a\nsimilar inference speed. We carefully conducted experiments to validate the\neffectiveness of each component. Our code is made available at\nhttps://github.com/meituan/YOLOv6.",

    "abstract": "Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are shown to be a promising method\nfor the approximation of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). PINNs\napproximate the PDE solution by minimizing physics-based loss functions over a\ngiven domain. Despite substantial progress in the application of PINNs to a\nrange of problem classes, investigation of error estimation and convergence\nproperties of PINNs, which is important for establishing the rationale behind\ntheir good empirical performance, has been lacking. This paper presents\nconvergence analysis and error estimates of PINNs for a multi-physics problem\nof thermally coupled incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Through a model\nproblem of Beltrami flow it is shown that a small training error implies a\nsmall generalization error. \\textit{Posteriori} convergence rates of total\nerror with respect to the training residual and collocation points are\npresented. This is of practical significance in determining appropriate number\nof training parameters and training residual thresholds to get good PINNs\nprediction of thermally coupled steady state laminar flows. These convergence\nrates are then generalized to different spatial geometries as well as to\ndifferent flow parameters that lie in the laminar regime. A pressure\nstabilization term in the form of pressure Poisson equation is added to the PDE\nresiduals for PINNs. This physics informed augmentation is shown to improve\naccuracy of the pressure field by an order of magnitude as compared to the case\nwithout augmentation. Results from PINNs are compared to the ones obtained from\nstabilized finite element method and good properties of PINNs are highlighted.",

Within this system, the positions of mobile agents may lead to shadow\nfading on the wireless channel that the WCS is controlled over and can\nsignificantly compromise the WCS's performance. This paper focuses on the\ncontroller design for the MAS to ensure the performance of WCS in the presence\nof WCS and MAS coupling. Firstly, the constrained finite field network (FFN)\nwith profile-dependent switching topology is adopted to proceed the operational\ncontrol for the MAS. By virtue of the algebraic state space representation\n(ASSR) method, an equivalent form is obtained for the WCS and MAS coupling. A\nnecessary and sufficient condition in terms of constrained set stabilization is\nthen established to ensure the Lyapunov-like performance with expected decay\nrate. Finally, a graphical method together with the breath-first searching is\nprovided to design state feedback controllers for the MAS. With this method, it\nis easy to check the constrained set stabilization of MAS and to ensure the\nperformance requirements of WCS in the presence of WCS and MAS coupling.

We improve cross-lingual transfer with three strategies: (1)\nwe introduce a linguistic prior objective to augment the cross-entropy loss\nwith a similarity-based loss to guide the model during training, (2) we learn a\ntask-specific subnetwork that improves cross-lingual generalisation and reduces\nvariance without model modification, (3) we augment training examples using\nsynthetic code-mixing to promote alignment of embeddings between source and\ntarget languages.

In this work, we propose a novel\ninteraction framework called Semantic Interactive Learning for the text domain.\nWe frame the problem of incorporating constructive and contextual feedback into\nthe learner as a task to find an architecture that (a) enables more semantic\nalignment between humans and machines and (b) at the same time helps to\nmaintain statistical characteristics of the input domain when generating\nuser-defined counterexamples based on meaningful corrections. Therefore, we\nintroduce a technique called SemanticPush that is effective for translating\nconceptual corrections of humans to non-extrapolating training examples such\nthat the learner's reasoning is pushed towards the desired behavior.

    "title": "Flow Straight and Fast: Learning to Generate and Transfer Data with  Rectified Flow",
    "abstract": "We present rectified flow, a surprisingly simple approach to learning\n(neural) ordinary differential equation (ODE) models to transport between two\nempirically observed distributions \\pi_0 and \\pi_1, hence providing a unified\nsolution to generative modeling and domain transfer, among various other tasks\ninvolving distribution transport. The idea of rectified flow is to learn the\nODE to follow the straight paths connecting the points drawn from \\pi_0 and\n\\pi_1 as much as possible. This is achieved by solving a straightforward\nnonlinear least squares optimization problem, which can be easily scaled to\nlarge models without introducing extra parameters beyond standard supervised\nlearning. The straight paths are special and preferred because they are the\nshortest paths between two points, and can be simulated exactly without time\ndiscretization and hence yield computationally efficient models. We show that\nthe procedure of learning a rectified flow from data, called rectification,\nturns an arbitrary coupling of \\pi_0 and \\pi_1 to a new deterministic coupling\nwith provably non-increasing convex transport costs. In addition, recursively\napplying rectification allows us to obtain a sequence of flows with\nincreasingly straight paths, which can be simulated accurately with coarse time\ndiscretization in the inference phase. In empirical studies, we show that\nrectified flow performs superbly on image generation, image-to-image\ntranslation, and domain adaptation. In particular, on image generation and\ntranslation, our method yields nearly straight flows that give high quality\nresults even with a single Euler discretization step.",

    "abstract": "Multi-hop Knowledge Base Question Answering(KBQA) aims to find the answer\nentity in a knowledge base which is several hops from the topic entity\nmentioned in the question. Existing Retrieval-based approaches first generate\ninstructions from the question and then use them to guide the multi-hop\nreasoning on the knowledge graph. As the instructions are fixed during the\nwhole reasoning procedure and the knowledge graph is not considered in\ninstruction generation, the model cannot revise its mistake once it predicts an\nintermediate entity incorrectly. To handle this, we propose KBIGER(Knowledge\nBase Iterative Instruction GEnerating and Reasoning), a novel and efficient\napproach to generate the instructions dynamically with the help of reasoning\ngraph. Instead of generating all the instructions before reasoning, we take the\n(k-1)-th reasoning graph into consideration to build the k-th instruction. In\nthis way, the model could check the prediction from the graph and generate new\ninstructions to revise the incorrect prediction of intermediate entities. We do\nexperiments on two multi-hop KBQA benchmarks and outperform the existing\napproaches, becoming the new-state-of-the-art.

    "abstract": "To pursue comprehensive performance, recent text detectors improve detection\nspeed at the expense of accuracy. They adopt shrink-mask based text\nrepresentation strategies, which leads to a high dependency of detection\naccuracy on shrink-masks. Unfortunately, three disadvantages cause unreliable\nshrink-masks. Specifically, these methods try to strengthen the discrimination\nof shrink-masks from the background by semantic information. However, the\nfeature defocusing phenomenon that coarse layers are optimized by fine-grained\nobjectives limits the extraction of semantic features. Meanwhile, since both\nshrink-masks and the margins belong to texts, the detail loss phenomenon that\nthe margins are ignored hinders the distinguishment of shrink-masks from the\nmargins, which causes ambiguous shrink-mask edges. Moreover, false-positive\nsamples enjoy similar visual features with shrink-masks. They aggravate the\ndecline of shrink-masks recognition. To avoid the above problems, we propose a\nZoom Text Detector (ZTD) inspired by the zoom process of the camera.\nSpecifically, Zoom Out Module (ZOM) is introduced to provide coarse-grained\noptimization objectives for coarse layers to avoid feature defocusing.\nMeanwhile, Zoom In Module (ZIM) is presented to enhance the margins recognition\nto prevent detail loss. Furthermore, Sequential-Visual Discriminator (SVD) is\ndesigned to suppress false-positive samples by sequential and visual features.\nExperiments verify the superior comprehensive performance of ZTD.",

It\nleads to limited text fitting ability and STD technique application.\nConsidering the above problem, we combine text geometric characteristics and\nbionics to design a natural leaf vein-based text representation method (LVT).\nConcretely, it is found that leaf vein is a generally directed graph, which can\neasily cover various geometries. Inspired by it, we treat text contour as leaf\nmargin and represent it through main, lateral, and thin veins. We further\nconstruct a detection framework based on LVT, namely LeafText. In the text\nreconstruction stage, LeafText simulates the leaf growth process to rebuild\ntext contour. It grows main vein in Cartesian coordinates to locate text\nroughly at first. Then, lateral and thin veins are generated along the main\nvein growth direction in polar coordinates. They are responsible for generating\ncoarse contour and refining it, respectively. Considering the deep dependency\nof lateral and thin veins on main vein, the Multi-Oriented Smoother (MOS) is\nproposed to enhance the robustness of main vein to ensure a reliable detection\nresult. Additionally, we propose a global incentive loss to accelerate the\npredictions of lateral and thin veins. Ablation experiments demonstrate LVT is\nable to depict arbitrary-shaped texts precisely and verify the effectiveness of\nMOS and global incentive loss.

Methods based on 3D Morphable Models\n(3DMM), and their combination with differentiable renderers, have shown\npromising results. However, the expressiveness of 3DMMs is limited, and they\ntypically yield over-smoothed and identity-agnostic 3D shapes limited to the\nface region. Highly accurate full head reconstructions have recently been\nobtained with neural fields that parameterize the geometry using multilayer\nperceptrons. The versatility of these representations has also proved effective\nfor disentangling geometry, materials and lighting. However, these methods\nrequire several tens of input images. In this paper, we introduce SIRA, a\nmethod which, from a single image, reconstructs human head avatars with high\nfidelity geometry and factorized lights and surface materials. Our key\ningredients are two data-driven statistical models based on neural fields that\nresolve the ambiguities of single-view 3D surface reconstruction and appearance\nfactorization. Experiments show that SIRA obtains state of the art results in\n3D head reconstruction while at the same time it successfully disentangles the\nglobal illumination, and the diffuse and specular albedos.

    "abstract": "Few-shot visual recognition refers to recognize novel visual concepts from a\nfew labeled instances. Many few-shot visual recognition methods adopt the\nmetric-based meta-learning paradigm by comparing the query representation with\nclass representations to predict the category of query instance. However,\ncurrent metric-based methods generally treat all instances equally and\nconsequently often obtain biased class representation, considering not all\ninstances are equally significant when summarizing the instance-level\nrepresentations for the class-level representation. For example, some instances\nmay contain unrepresentative information, such as too much background and\ninformation of unrelated concepts, which skew the results. To address the above\nissues, we propose a novel metric-based meta-learning framework termed\ninstance-adaptive class representation learning network (ICRL-Net) for few-shot\nvisual recognition. Specifically, we develop an adaptive instance revaluing\nnetwork with the capability to address the biased representation issue when\ngenerating the class representation, by learning and assigning adaptive weights\nfor different instances according to their relative significance in the support\nset of corresponding class. Additionally, we design an improved bilinear\ninstance representation and incorporate two novel structural losses, i.e.,\nintra-class instance clustering loss and inter-class representation\ndistinguishing loss, to further regulate the instance revaluation process and\nrefine the class representation. We conduct extensive experiments on four\ncommonly adopted few-shot benchmarks: miniImageNet, tieredImageNet, CIFAR-FS,\nand FC100 datasets.

The experimental analysis\nindicates that in the static environment, SPWNN with Morlet activation function\noutperformed SPWNN with Gaussian on the classification datasets. However, in\nthe case of regression, the opposite was observed.

    "title": "Physics-based Digital Twins for Autonomous Thermal Food Processing:  Efficient, Non-intrusive Reduced-order Modeling",
    "abstract": "One possible way of making thermal processing controllable is to gather\nreal-time information on the product's current state. Often, sensory equipment\ncannot capture all relevant information easily or at all. Digital Twins close\nthis gap with virtual probes in real-time simulations, synchronized with the\nprocess. This paper proposes a physics-based, data-driven Digital Twin\nframework for autonomous food processing. We suggest a lean Digital Twin\nconcept that is executable at the device level, entailing minimal computational\nload, data storage, and sensor data requirements. This study focuses on a\nparsimonious experimental design for training non-intrusive reduced-order\nmodels (ROMs) of a thermal process. A correlation ($R=-0.76$) between a high\nstandard deviation of the surface temperatures in the training data and a low\nroot mean square error in ROM testing enables efficient selection of training\ndata. The mean test root mean square error of the best ROM is less than 1\nKelvin (0.2 % mean average percentage error) on representative test sets.\nSimulation speed-ups of Sp $\\approx$ 1.8E4 allow on-device model predictive\ncontrol.\nThe proposed Digital Twin framework is designed to be applicable within the\nindustry. Typically, non-intrusive reduced-order modeling is required as soon\nas the modeling of the process is performed in software, where root-level\naccess to the solver is not provided, such as commercial simulation software.\nThe data-driven training of the reduced-order model is achieved with only one\ndata set, as correlations are utilized to predict the training success a\npriori.",

    "abstract": "Recent masked image modeling (MIM) has received much attention in\nself-supervised learning (SSL), which requires the target model to recover the\nmasked part of the input image. Although MIM-based pre-training methods achieve\nnew state-of-the-art performance when transferred to many downstream tasks, the\nvisualizations show that the learned representations are less separable,\nespecially compared to those based on contrastive learning pre-training. This\ninspires us to think whether the linear separability of MIM pre-trained\nrepresentation can be further improved, thereby improving the pre-training\nperformance. Since MIM and contrastive learning tend to utilize different data\naugmentations and training strategies, combining these two pretext tasks is not\ntrivial. In this work, we propose a novel and flexible pre-training framework,\nnamed MimCo, which combines MIM and contrastive learning through two-stage\npre-training. Specifically, MimCo takes a pre-trained contrastive learning\nmodel as the teacher model and is pre-trained with two types of learning\ntargets: patch-level and image-level reconstruction losses.\nExtensive transfer experiments on downstream tasks demonstrate the superior\nperformance of our MimCo pre-training framework. Taking ViT-S as an example,\nwhen using the pre-trained MoCov3-ViT-S as the teacher model, MimCo only needs\n100 epochs of pre-training to achieve 82.53% top-1 finetuning accuracy on\nImagenet-1K, which outperforms the state-of-the-art self-supervised learning\ncounterparts.",

Our main structural result is that maximal plane\nsubgraphs are 2-connected and what we call essentially 3-edge-connected.\nBesides, any maximal plane subgraph contains at least $\\lceil 3n/2 \\rceil$\nedges. We also address the problem of obtaining a plane subgraph of $D_n$ with\nthe maximum number of edges, proving that this problem is NP-complete. However,\ngiven a plane spanning connected subgraph of $D_n$, a maximum plane\naugmentation of this subgraph can be found in $O(n^3)$ time.

    "abstract": "Security of Additive Manufacturing (AM) gets increased attention due to the\ngrowing proliferation and adoption of AM in a variety of applications and\nbusiness models. However, there is a significant disconnect between AM\ncommunity focused on manufacturing and AM Security community focused on\nsecuring this highly computerized manufacturing technology. To bridge this gap,\nwe surveyed the America Makes AM community, asking in total eleven AM\nsecurity-related questions aiming to discover the existing concerns, posture,\nand expectations. The first set of questions aimed to discover how many of\nthese organizations use AM, outsource AM, or provide AM as a service. Then we\nasked about biggest security concerns as well as about assessment of who the\npotential adversaries might be and their motivation for attack. We then\nproceeded with questions on any experienced security incidents, if any security\nrisk assessment was conducted, and if the participants' organizations were\npartnering with external experts to secure AM. Lastly, we asked whether\nsecurity measures are implemented at all and, if yes, whether they fall under\nthe general cyber-security category. Out of 69 participants affiliated with\ncommercial industry, agencies, and academia, 53 have completed the entire\nsurvey. This paper presents the results of this survey, as well as provides our\nassessment of the AM Security posture. The answers are a mixture of what we\ncould label as expected, \"shocking but not surprising,\" and completely\nunexpected. Assuming that the provided answers are somewhat representative to\nthe current state of the AM industry, we conclude that the industry is not\nready to prevent or detect AM-specific attacks that have been demonstrated in\nthe research literature.",

Plant recognition is one of the areas where image\nclassification can be used to identify plant species through their leaves.\nBotanists devote a significant amount of time to recognizing plant species by\npersonally inspecting. This paper describes a method for dissecting color\nimages of Swedish leaves and identifying plant species. To achieve higher\naccuracy, the task is completed using transfer learning with the help of\npre-trained classifier VGG-19. The four primary processes of classification are\nimage preprocessing, image augmentation, feature extraction, and recognition,\nwhich are performed as part of the overall model evaluation. The VGG-19\nclassifier grasps the characteristics of leaves by employing pre-defined hidden\nlayers such as convolutional layers, max pooling layers, and fully connected\nlayers, and finally uses the soft-max layer to generate a feature\nrepresentation for all plant classes. The model obtains knowledge connected to\naspects of the Swedish leaf dataset, which contains fifteen tree classes, and\naids in predicting the proper class of an unknown plant with an accuracy of\n99.70% which is higher than previous research works reported.",

In this design study, we show how\ninteractive visual exploration and analysis of high-dimensional, spectral data\nfrom noise simulation can facilitate design improvements in the context of\nconflicting criteria. Here, we focus on structure-borne noise, i.e., noise from\nvibrating mechanical parts. Detecting problematic noise sources early in the\ndesign and production process is essential for reducing a product's development\ncosts and its time to market. In a close collaboration of visualization and\nautomotive engineering, we designed a new, interactive approach to quickly\nidentify and analyze critical noise sources, also contributing to an improved\nunderstanding of the analyzed system. Several carefully designed, interactive\nlinked views enable the exploration of noises, vibrations, and harshness at\nmultiple levels of detail, both in the frequency and spatial domain. This\nenables swift and smooth changes of perspective; selections in the frequency\ndomain are immediately reflected in the spatial domain, and vice versa. Noise\nsources are quickly identified and shown in the context of their neighborhood,\nboth in the frequency and spatial domain. We propose a novel drill-down view,\nespecially tailored to noise data analysis. Split boxplots and synchronized 3D\ngeometry views support comparison tasks.

In this\npaper, we describe a novel passive and privacy-preserving human localization\nsolution that relies on the directive transmission properties of mmWave\ncommunications to monitor social distancing and notify people in the area in\ncase of violations. Thus, addressing the social distancing challenge in a\nprivacy-preserving and cost-efficient manner. Our solution provides an overall\naccuracy of about 99% in the tested scenarios.",

    "title": "Effects of Archive Size on Computation Time and Solution Quality for  Multi-Objective Optimization",
    "abstract": "An unbounded external archive has been used to store all nondominated\nsolutions found by an evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm in\nsome studies. It has been shown that a selected solution subset from the stored\nsolutions is often better than the final population. However, the use of the\nunbounded archive is not always realistic. When the number of examined\nsolutions is huge, we must pre-specify the archive size. In this study, we\nexamine the effects of the archive size on three aspects: (i) the quality of\nthe selected final solution set, (ii) the total computation time for the\narchive maintenance and the final solution set selection, and (iii) the\nrequired memory size. Unsurprisingly, the increase of the archive size improves\nthe final solution set quality. Interestingly, the total computation time of a\nmedium-size archive is much larger than that of a small-size archive and a\nhuge-size archive (e.g., an unbounded archive). To decrease the computation\ntime, we examine two ideas: periodical archive update and archiving only in\nlater generations. Compared with updating the archive at every generation, the\nfirst idea can obtain almost the same final solution set quality using a much\nshorter computation time at the cost of a slight increase of the memory size.\nThe second idea drastically decreases the computation time at the cost of a\nslight deterioration of the final solution set quality. Based on our\nexperimental results, some suggestions are given about how to appropriately\nchoose an archiving strategy and an archive size.",

    "abstract": "Fusing LiDAR and camera information is essential for achieving accurate and\nreliable 3D object detection in autonomous driving systems. However, this is\nchallenging due to the difficulty of combining multi-granularity geometric and\nsemantic features from two drastically different modalities. Recent approaches\naim at exploring the semantic densities of camera features through lifting\npoints in 2D camera images (referred to as seeds) into 3D space for fusion, and\nthey can be roughly divided into 1) early fusion of raw points that aims at\naugmenting the 3D point cloud at the early input stage, and 2) late fusion of\nBEV (bird-eye view) maps that merges LiDAR and camera BEV features before the\ndetection head. While both have their merits in enhancing the representation\npower of the combined features, this single-level fusion strategy is a\nsuboptimal solution to the aforementioned challenge. Their major drawbacks are\nthe inability to interact the multi-granularity semantic features from two\ndistinct modalities sufficiently. To this end, we propose a novel framework\nthat focuses on the multi-scale progressive interaction of the\nmulti-granularity LiDAR and camera features. Our proposed method, abbreviated\nas MDMSFusion, achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D object detection, with\n69.1 mAP and 71.8 NDS on nuScenes validation set, and 70.8 mAP and 73.2 NDS on\nnuScenes test set, which rank 1st and 2nd respectively among single-model\nnon-ensemble approaches by the time of submission.",

    "abstract": "Imaging demonstrates that preclinical and human tumors are heterogeneous,\ni.e. a single tumor can exhibit multiple regions that behave differently during\nboth normal development and also in response to treatment. The large variations\nobserved in control group tumors can obscure detection of significant\ntherapeutic effects due to the ambiguity in attributing causes of change. This\ncan hinder development of effective therapies due to limitations in\nexperimental design, rather than due to therapeutic failure. An improved method\nto model biological variation and heterogeneity in imaging signals is\ndescribed. Specifically, Linear Poisson modelling (LPM) evaluates changes in\napparent diffusion co-efficient (ADC) before and 72 hours after radiotherapy,\nin two xenograft models of colorectal cancer. The statistical significance of\nmeasured changes are compared to those attainable using a conventional t-test\nanalysis on basic ADC distribution parameters. When LPMs were applied to\ntreated tumors, the LPMs detected highly significant changes. The analyses were\nsignificant for all tumors, equating to a gain in power of 4 fold (i.e.\nequivelent to having a sample size 16 times larger), compared with the\nconventional approach. In contrast, highly significant changes are only\ndetected at a cohort level using t-tests, restricting their potential use\nwithin personalised medicine and increasing the number of animals required\nduring testing. Furthermore, LPM enabled the relative volumes of responding and\nnon-responding tissue to be estimated for each xenograft model.

Federated\nLearning supports collecting a wealth of multimodal data from different devices\nwithout sharing raw data. Transfer Learning methods help transfer knowledge\nfrom some devices to others. Federated Transfer Learning methods benefit both\nFederated Learning and Transfer Learning. This newly proposed Federated\nTransfer Learning framework aims at connecting data islands with privacy\nprotection. Our construction is based on Federated Learning and Transfer\nLearning. Compared with previous Federated Transfer Learnings, where each user\nshould have data with identical modalities (either all unimodal or all\nmultimodal), our new framework is more generic, it allows a hybrid distribution\nof user data. The core strategy is to use two different but inherently\nconnected training methods for our two types of users. Supervised Learning is\nadopted for users with only unimodal data (Type 1), while Self-Supervised\nLearning is applied to user with multimodal data (Type 2) for both the feature\nof each modality and the connection between them. This connection knowledge of\nType 2 will help Type 1 in later stages of training. Training in the new\nframework can be divided in three steps. In the first step, users who have data\nwith the identical modalities are grouped together. For example, user with only\nsound signals are in group one, and those with only images are in group two,\nand users with multimodal data are in group three, and so on. In the second\nstep, Federated Learning is executed within the groups, where Supervised\nLearning and Self-Supervised Learning are used depending on the group's nature.\nMost of the Transfer Learning happens in the third step, where the related\nparts in the network obtained from the previous steps are aggregated\n(federated).",

    "abstract": "We introduce AudioLM, a framework for high-quality audio generation with\nlong-term consistency. AudioLM maps the input audio to a sequence of discrete\ntokens and casts audio generation as a language modeling task in this\nrepresentation space. We show how existing audio tokenizers provide different\ntrade-offs between reconstruction quality and long-term structure, and we\npropose a hybrid tokenization scheme to achieve both objectives. Namely, we\nleverage the discretized activations of a masked language model pre-trained on\naudio to capture long-term structure and the discrete codes produced by a\nneural audio codec to achieve high-quality synthesis. By training on large\ncorpora of raw audio waveforms, AudioLM learns to generate natural and coherent\ncontinuations given short prompts. When trained on speech, and without any\ntranscript or annotation, AudioLM generates syntactically and semantically\nplausible speech continuations while also maintaining speaker identity and\nprosody for unseen speakers. Furthermore, we demonstrate how our approach\nextends beyond speech by generating coherent piano music continuations, despite\nbeing trained without any symbolic representation of music.",

    "abstract": "Recently, temporal graphs have substituted dynamic graphs as many real-world\nproblems evolve in continuous time rather than in discrete time, and besides\ntime almost all problems are designed in a heterogeneous format rather than a\nhomogeneous one. However, most existing graph representations do not consider\ntime in their components. To this end, in this paper, we present a new\nheterogeneous graph representation including time in every single component of\nthe graph, i.e., nodes and edges. We also introduce four time-dependent queries\nto address machine learning or deep learning problems. Our findings reveal that\nconsidering the size of the enormous graphs, our time-dependent queries execute\nefficiently. In order to show the expressive power of time in graph\nrepresentation, we construct a graph for a new social media platform (Steemit),\nand address a DL prediction task using graph neural networks (GNNs). Predicting\nthe payout for a newly published post is one of the most fascinating\nclassification problems in the Steemit setting, and we address this problem\nwith two approaches followed by GNN models.",

Yet progress has been slow, as a balance must be struck\nbetween computational efficiency and the quality of uncertainty estimates. For\nthis reason many use deep ensembles of neural networks or Monte Carlo dropout\nfor reasonable uncertainty estimates at relatively minimal compute and memory.\nSurprisingly, when we focus on the real-world applicable constraint of $\\leq\n1\\%$ false positive rate (FPR), prior methods fail to reliably detect OOD\nsamples as such.

We help to alleviate this problem by devising a simple\nadversarial training scheme that incorporates an attack of the epistemic\nuncertainty predicted by the dropout ensemble.

As the workplace type expands from\nonsite offices to remote areas, an emerging challenge for an online hiring\nmarketplace is how these remote opportunities and user intentions to work\nremotely can be modeled and matched without prior information. Despite the\nunprecedented amount of remote jobs posted amid COVID-19, there is no existing\napproach that can be directly applied.\nIntroducing a brand new workplace type naturally leads to the cold-start\nproblem, which is particularly more common for less active job seekers. It is\nchallenging, if not impossible, to onboard a new workplace type for any\npredictive model if existing information sources can provide little information\nrelated to a new category of jobs, including data from resumes and job\ndescriptions. Hence, in this work, we aim to propose a principled approach that\njointly models the remoteness of job seekers and job opportunities with limited\ninformation, which also suffices the needs of web-scale applications. Existing\nresearch on the emerging type of remote workplace mainly focuses on qualitative\nstudies, and classic predictive modeling approaches are inapplicable\nconsidering the problem of cold-start and information scarcity.

Recently, some careful\nresearchers paid attention to diversity of information dissemination,\nespecially community-aware diversity, and formulated the diversified IM\nproblem. The diversity is ubiquitous in a lot of real-world applications, but\nthey are all based on a given community structure. In social networks, we can\nform heterogeneous community structures for the same group of users according\nto different metrics. Therefore, how to quantify the diversity based on\nmultiple community structures is an interesting question. In this paper, we\npropose the Composite Community-Aware Diversified IM (CC-DIM) problem, which\naims at selecting a seed set to maximize the influence spread and the composite\ndiversity over all possible community structures under consideration. To\naddress the NP-hardness of CC-DIM problem, we adopt the technique of reverse\ninfluence sampling and design a random Generalized Reverse Reachable (G-RR) set\nto estimate the objective function. The composition of a random G-RR set is\nmuch more complex than the RR set used for the IM problem, which will lead to\ninefficiency of traditional sampling-based approximation algorithms. Because of\nthis, we further propose a two-stage algorithm, Generalized HIST (G-HIST). It\ncan not only return a $(1-1/e-\\varepsilon)$ approximate solution with at least\n$(1-\\delta)$ probability, but also improve the efficiency of sampling and ease\nthe difficulty of searching by significantly reducing the average size of G-RR\nsets.

    "title": "On the Effectiveness of Compact Biomedical Transformers",
    "abstract": "Language models pre-trained on biomedical corpora, such as BioBERT, have\nrecently shown promising results on downstream biomedical tasks. Many existing\npre-trained models, on the other hand, are resource-intensive and\ncomputationally heavy owing to factors such as embedding size, hidden\ndimension, and number of layers. The natural language processing (NLP)\ncommunity has developed numerous strategies to compress these models utilising\ntechniques such as pruning, quantisation, and knowledge distillation, resulting\nin models that are considerably faster, smaller, and subsequently easier to use\nin practice. By the same token, in this paper we introduce six lightweight\nmodels, namely, BioDistilBERT, BioTinyBERT, BioMobileBERT, DistilBioBERT,\nTinyBioBERT, and CompactBioBERT which are obtained either by knowledge\ndistillation from a biomedical teacher or continual learning on the Pubmed\ndataset via the Masked Language Modelling (MLM) objective. We evaluate all of\nour models on three biomedical tasks and compare them with BioBERT-v1.1 to\ncreate efficient lightweight models that perform on par with their larger\ncounterparts. All the models will be publicly available on our Huggingface\nprofile at https://huggingface.co/nlpie and the codes used to run the\nexperiments will be available at\nhttps://github.com/nlpie-research/Compact-Biomedical-Transformers.",

One way to generalize beyond the original training is\nthrough human-informed augmentation of the original dataset; however, it is\nimpossible to specify all possible failure cases that can occur during\ndeployment. To address this limitation we combine model-based reinforcement\nlearning and model-interpretability methods to propose a solution that\nself-generates simulated scenarios constrained by environmental concepts and\ndynamics learned in an unsupervised manner. In particular, an internal model of\nthe agent's environment is conditioned on low-dimensional concept\nrepresentations of the input space that are sensitive to the agent's actions.\nWe demonstrate this method within a standard realistic driving simulator in a\nsimple point-to-point navigation task, where we show dramatic improvements in\none-shot generalization to different instances of specified failure cases as\nwell as zero-shot generalization to similar variations compared to model-based\nand model-free approaches.",

The key idea is to include\nestimated stochastic travel demand patterns into receding horizon AMoD\noptimization problems. More precisely, we first estimate passenger demand using\nGaussian Process Regression (GPR). GPR provides demand uncertainty bounds for\ntime pattern prediction. Second, we integrate demand predictions with\nuncertainty bounds into a receding horizon AMoD optimization. In order to\nguarantee constraint satisfaction in the above optimization under estimated\nstochastic demand prediction, we employ a probabilistic constraining method\nwith user defined confidence interval. Receding horizon AMoD optimization with\nprobabilistic constraints thereby calls for Chance Constrained Model Predictive\nControl (CCMPC). The benefit of the proposed method is twofold. First, travel\ndemand uncertainty prediction from data can naturally be embedded into AMoD\noptimization. Second, CCMPC can further be relaxed into a\nMixed-Integer-Linear-Program (MILP) that can efficiently be solved.

Standard metrics based on average precision produce model\nvulnerability estimates at the object level rather than at an image level. As\nwe show in this paper, this does not provide an intuitive or representative\nindicator of the safety-related impact of silent data corruption caused by bit\nflips in the underlying memory but can lead to an over- or underestimation of\ntypical fault-induced hazards. With an eye towards safety-related real-time\napplications, we propose a new metric IVMOD (Image-wise Vulnerability Metric\nfor Object Detection) to quantify vulnerability based on an incorrect\nimage-wise object detection due to false positive (FPs) or false negative (FNs)\nobjects, combined with a severity analysis. The evaluation of several\nrepresentative object detection models shows that even a single bit flip can\nlead to a severe silent data corruption event with potentially critical safety\nimplications, with e.g., up to (much greater than) 100 FPs generated, or up to\napprox. 90% of true positives (TPs) are lost in an image. Furthermore, with a\nsingle stuck-at-1 fault, an entire sequence of images can be affected, causing\ntemporally persistent ghost detections that can be mistaken for actual objects\n(covering up to approx. 83% of the image). Furthermore, actual objects in the\nscene are continuously missed (up to approx. 64% of TPs are lost).

    "title": "AutoPruner: Transformer-Based Call Graph Pruning",
    "abstract": "Constructing a static call graph requires trade-offs between soundness and\nprecision. Program analysis techniques for constructing call graphs are\nunfortunately usually imprecise. To address this problem, researchers have\nrecently proposed call graph pruning empowered by machine learning to\npost-process call graphs constructed by static analysis. A machine learning\nmodel is built to capture information from the call graph by extracting\nstructural features for use in a random forest classifier. It then removes\nedges that are predicted to be false positives. Despite the improvements shown\nby machine learning models, they are still limited as they do not consider the\nsource code semantics and thus often are not able to effectively distinguish\ntrue and false positives. In this paper, we present a novel call graph pruning\ntechnique, AutoPruner, for eliminating false positives in call graphs via both\nstatistical semantic and structural analysis. Given a call graph constructed by\ntraditional static analysis tools, AutoPruner takes a Transformer-based\napproach to capture the semantic relationships between the caller and callee\nfunctions associated with each edge in the call graph. To do so, AutoPruner\nfine-tunes a model of code that was pre-trained on a large corpus to represent\nsource code based on descriptions of its semantics. Next, the model is used to\nextract semantic features from the functions related to each edge in the call\ngraph. AutoPruner uses these semantic features together with the structural\nfeatures extracted from the call graph to classify each edge via a feed-forward\nneural network. Our empirical evaluation on a benchmark dataset of real-world\nprograms shows that AutoPruner outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines,\nimproving on F-measure by up to 13% in identifying false-positive edges in a\nstatic call graph.",

    "abstract": "Unmanned surface vessels (USVs) are widely used in ocean exploration and\nenvironmental protection fields. To ensure that USV can successfully perform\nits mission, trajectory planning and motion tracking are the two most critical\ntechnologies. In this paper, we propose a novel trajectory generation and\ntracking method for USV based on optimization theory. Specifically, the USV\ndynamic model is described with differential flatness, so that the trajectory\ncan be generated by dynamic RRT* in a linear invariant system expression form\nunder the objective of optimal boundary value. To reduce the sample number and\nimprove efficiency, we adjust the trajectory through local optimization. The\ndynamic constraints are considered in the optimization process so that the\ngenerated trajectory conforms to the kinematic characteristics of the\nunder-actuated hull, and makes it easier to be tracked. Finally, motion\ntracking is added with model predictive control under a sequential quadratic\nprogramming problem. Experimental results show the planned trajectory is more\nin line with the kinematic characteristics of USV, and the tracking accuracy\nremains a higher level.",

    "abstract": "Distilling physical laws autonomously from data has been of great interest in\nmany scientific areas. The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy)\nand its variations have been developed to extract the underlying governing\nequations from observation data. However, SINDy faces certain difficulties when\nthe dynamics contain rational functions. The principle of the least action\ngoverns many mechanical systems, mathematically expressed in the Lagrangian\nformula. Compared to the actual equation of motions, the Lagrangian is much\nmore concise, especially for complex systems, and does not usually contain\nrational functions for mechanical systems. Only a few methods have been\nproposed to extract the Lagrangian from measurement data so far. One of such\nmethods, Lagrangian-SINDy, can extract the true form of Lagrangian of dynamical\nsystems from data but suffers when noises are present. In this work, we develop\nan extended version of Lagrangian-SINDy (xL-SINDy) to obtain the Lagrangian of\ndynamical systems from noisy measurement data. We incorporate the concept of\nSINDy and utilize the proximal gradient method to obtain sparse expressions of\nthe Lagrangian. We demonstrated the effectiveness of xL-SINDy against different\nnoise levels with four nonlinear dynamics: a single pendulum, a cart-pendulum,\na double pendulum, and a spherical pendulum. Furthermore, we also verified the\nperformance of xL-SINDy against SINDy-PI (parallel, implicit), a recent robust\nvariant of SINDy that can handle implicit dynamics and rational nonlinearities.\nOur experiment results show that xL-SINDy is 8-20 times more robust than\nSINDy-PI in the presence of noise.",

    "abstract": "Linear algebra expressions, which play a central role in countless scientific\ncomputations, are often computed via a sequence of calls to existing libraries\nof building blocks (such as those provided by BLAS and LAPACK). A sequence\nidentifies a computing strategy, i.e., an algorithm, and normally for one\nlinear algebra expression many alternative algorithms exist. Although\nmathematically equivalent, those algorithms might exhibit significant\ndifferences in terms of performance. Several high-level languages and tools for\nmatrix computations such as Julia, Armadillo, Linnea, etc., make algorithmic\nchoices by minimizing the number of Floating Point Operations (FLOPs). However,\nthere can be several algorithms that share the same (or have nearly identical)\nnumber of FLOPs; in many cases, these algorithms exhibit execution times which\nare statistically equivalent and one could arbitrarily select one of them as\nthe best algorithm. It is however not unlikely to find cases where the\nexecution times are significantly different from one another (despite the FLOP\ncount being almost the same). It is also possible that the algorithm that\nminimizes FLOPs is not the one that minimizes execution time. In this work, we\ndevelop a methodology to test the reliability of FLOPs as discriminant for\nlinear algebra algorithms. Given a set of algorithms (for an instance of a\nlinear algebra expression) as input, the methodology ranks them into\nperformance classes; algorithms in the same class are statistically equivalent\nin performance. To this end, we measure the algorithms iteratively until the\nchanges in the ranks converge to a value close to zero. FLOPs are a valid\ndiscriminant for an instance if all the algorithms with minimum FLOPs are\nassigned the best rank; otherwise, the instance is regarded as an anomaly,\nwhich can then be used in the investigation of the root cause of performance\ndifferences.",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised visual representation learning has recently attracted\nsignificant research interest. While a common way to evaluate self-supervised\nrepresentations is through transfer to various downstream tasks, we instead\ninvestigate the problem of measuring their interpretability, i.e. understanding\nthe semantics encoded in raw representations. We formulate the latter as\nestimating the mutual information between the representation and a space of\nmanually labelled concepts. To quantify this we introduce a decoding\nbottleneck: information must be captured by simple predictors, mapping concepts\nto clusters in representation space. This approach, which we call reverse\nlinear probing, provides a single number sensitive to the semanticity of the\nrepresentation. This measure is also able to detect when the representation\ncontains combinations of concepts (e.g., \"red apple\") instead of just\nindividual attributes (\"red\" and \"apple\" independently). Finally, we propose to\nuse supervised classifiers to automatically label large datasets in order to\nenrich the space of concepts used for probing. We use our method to evaluate a\nlarge number of self-supervised representations, ranking them by\ninterpretability, highlight the differences that emerge compared to the\nstandard evaluation with linear probes and discuss several qualitative\ninsights.

    "abstract": "Visual imitation learning provides efficient and intuitive solutions for\nrobotic systems to acquire novel manipulation skills. However, simultaneously\nlearning geometric task constraints and control policies from visual inputs\nalone remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose an approach for\nkeypoint-based visual imitation (K-VIL) that automatically extracts sparse,\nobject-centric, and embodiment-independent task representations from a small\nnumber of human demonstration videos. The task representation is composed of\nkeypoint-based geometric constraints on principal manifolds, their associated\nlocal frames, and the movement primitives that are then needed for the task\nexecution. Our approach is capable of extracting such task representations from\na single demonstration video, and of incrementally updating them when new\ndemonstrations become available. To reproduce manipulation skills using the\nlearned set of prioritized geometric constraints in novel scenes, we introduce\na novel keypoint-based admittance controller. We evaluate our approach in\nseveral real-world applications, showcasing its ability to deal with cluttered\nscenes, new instances of categorical objects, and large object pose and shape\nvariations, as well as its efficiency and robustness in both one-shot and\nfew-shot imitation learning settings.

    "abstract": "A major challenge in cooperative sensing is to weight the measurements taken\nfrom the various sources to get an accurate result. Ideally, the weights should\nbe inversely proportional to the error in the sensing information. However,\nprevious cooperative sensor fusion approaches for autonomous vehicles use a\nfixed error model, in which the covariance of a sensor and its recognizer\npipeline is just the mean of the measured covariance for all sensing scenarios.\nThe approach proposed in this paper estimates error using key predictor terms\nthat have high correlation with sensing and localization accuracy for accurate\ncovariance estimation of each sensor observation. We adopt a tiered fusion\nmodel consisting of local and global sensor fusion steps. At the local fusion\nlevel, we add in a covariance generation stage using the error model for each\nsensor and the measured distance to generate the expected covariance matrix for\neach observation. At the global sensor fusion stage we add an additional stage\nto generate the localization covariance matrix from the key predictor term\nvelocity and combines that with the covariance generated from the local fusion\nfor accurate cooperative sensing. To showcase our method, we built a set of\n1/10 scale model autonomous vehicles with scale accurate sensing capabilities\nand classified the error characteristics against a motion capture system.\nResults show an average and max improvement in RMSE when detecting vehicle\npositions of 1.42x and 1.78x respectively in a four-vehicle cooperative fusion\nscenario when using our error model versus a typical fixed error model.",

This algorithm is leveraged for two minimization problems.\nThe first one is the minimization of a regularized negative log- likelihood\n(NLL). The latter makes the trade-off between a white Gaussian distribution and\nthe NC-MSG. Conditions on the regularization are given so that the existence of\na minimum to this problem is guaranteed without assumptions on the samples.\nThen, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between two NC-MSG is derived. This\ndivergence enables us to define a minimization problem to compute centers of\nmass of several NC-MSGs. The proposed Riemannian gradient descent algorithm is\nleveraged to solve this second minimization problem. Numerical experiments show\nthe good performance and the speed of the Riemannian gradient descent on the\ntwo problems.

However, it usually fails to\nachieve notable gains (some- times, even worse) on resource-rich NMT on par\nwith its Random-Initialization (RI) counterpart. We take the first step to\ninvestigate the complementarity between PT and RI in resource-rich scenarios\nvia two probing analyses, and find that: 1) PT improves NOT the accuracy, but\nthe generalization by achieving flatter loss landscapes than that of RI; 2) PT\nimproves NOT the confidence of lexical choice, but the negative diversity by\nassigning smoother lexical probability distributions than that of RI.

However, the recent cutting-edge generation methods enable high\nqualities of synthesis in CG images, which makes this challenging task even\ntrickier. To address this issue, a joint learning strategy with deep texture\nand high-frequency features for CG image detection is proposed. We first\nformulate and deeply analyze the different acquisition processes of CG and PG\nimages. Based on the finding that multiple different modules in image\nacquisition will lead to different sensitivity inconsistencies to the\nconvolutional neural network (CNN)-based rendering in images, we propose a deep\ntexture rendering module for texture difference enhancement and discriminative\ntexture representation. Specifically, the semantic segmentation map is\ngenerated to guide the affine transformation operation, which is used to\nrecover the texture in different regions of the input image. Then, the\ncombination of the original image and the high-frequency components of the\noriginal and rendered images are fed into a multi-branch neural network\nequipped with attention mechanisms, which refines intermediate features and\nfacilitates trace exploration in spatial and channel dimensions respectively.\nExtensive experiments on two public datasets and a newly constructed dataset\nwith more realistic and diverse images show that the proposed approach\noutperforms existing methods in the field by a clear margin.

Leakage between training and test data\ncan lead to overestimating the model's accuracy during offline evaluations,\npossibly leading to deployment of low-quality models in production. Such\nleakage can happen easily by mistake or by following poor practices, but may be\ntedious and challenging to detect manually. We develop a static analysis\napproach to detect common forms of data leakage in data science code. Our\nevaluation shows that our analysis accurately detects data leakage and that\nsuch leakage is pervasive among over 100,000 analyzed public notebooks.

    "abstract": "Statistical shape modeling (SSM) is a valuable and powerful tool to generate\na detailed representation of complex anatomy that enables quantitative analysis\nand the comparison of shapes and their variations. SSM applies mathematics,\nstatistics, and computing to parse the shape into a quantitative representation\n(such as correspondence points or landmarks) that will help answer various\nquestions about the anatomical variations across the population. Complex\nanatomical structures have many diverse parts with varying interactions or\nintricate architecture. For example, the heart is four-chambered anatomy with\nseveral shared boundaries between chambers. Coordinated and efficient\ncontraction of the chambers of the heart is necessary to adequately perfuse end\norgans throughout the body. Subtle shape changes within these shared boundaries\nof the heart can indicate potential pathological changes that lead to\nuncoordinated contraction and poor end-organ perfusion. Early detection and\nrobust quantification could provide insight into ideal treatment techniques and\nintervention timing. However, existing SSM approaches fall short of explicitly\nmodeling the statistics of shared boundaries. This paper presents a general and\nflexible data-driven approach for building statistical shape models of\nmulti-organ anatomies with shared boundaries that capture morphological and\nalignment changes of individual anatomies and their shared boundary surfaces\nthroughout the population. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethods using a biventricular heart dataset by developing shape models that\nconsistently parameterize the cardiac biventricular structure and the\ninterventricular septum (shared boundary surface) across the population data.",

This way, a network trained\nonce for denoising can be repurposed for other video restoration tasks. Our\nexperiments in video deblurring, super-resolution, and interpolation of random\nmissing pixels all show a clear benefit to using a network specifically\ndesigned for video denoising, as it yields better restoration performance and\nbetter temporal stability than a single image network with similar denoising\nperformance using the same PnP formulation.

This phenomena generally occurs\nwhen a trained classifier is deployed on varying dynamic environments, which\ncauses a significant drop in performance. To tackle this issue, we are\nproposing an end-to-end deep multi-task network in this work. Observing a\nstrong relationship between rotation prediction (self-supervised) accuracy and\nsemantic classification accuracy on OOD tasks, we introduce an additional\nauxiliary classification head in our multi-task network along with semantic\nclassification and rotation prediction head. To observe the influence of this\naddition classifier in improving the rotation prediction head, our proposed\nlearning method is framed into bi-level optimisation problem where the\nupper-level is trained to update the parameters for semantic classification and\nrotation prediction head. In the lower-level optimisation, only the auxiliary\nclassification head is updated through semantic classification head by fixing\nthe parameters of the semantic classification head. The proposed method has\nbeen validated through three unseen OOD datasets where it exhibits a clear\nimprovement in semantic classification accuracy than other two baseline\nmethods.

At the current\nstage, automatically segmenting the lung infection area from CT images is\nessential for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.

    "abstract": "IceCube, a cubic-kilometer array of optical sensors built to detect\natmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos between 1 GeV and 1 PeV, is deployed\n1.45 km to 2.45 km below the surface of the ice sheet at the South Pole. The\nclassification and reconstruction of events from the in-ice detectors play a\ncentral role in the analysis of data from IceCube. Reconstructing and\nclassifying events is a challenge due to the irregular detector geometry,\ninhomogeneous scattering and absorption of light in the ice and, below 100 GeV,\nthe relatively low number of signal photons produced per event. To address this\nchallenge, it is possible to represent IceCube events as point cloud graphs and\nuse a Graph Neural Network (GNN) as the classification and reconstruction\nmethod. The GNN is capable of distinguishing neutrino events from cosmic-ray\nbackgrounds, classifying different neutrino event types, and reconstructing the\ndeposited energy, direction and interaction vertex. Based on simulation, we\nprovide a comparison in the 1-100 GeV energy range to the current\nstate-of-the-art maximum likelihood techniques used in current IceCube\nanalyses, including the effects of known systematic uncertainties. For neutrino\nevent classification, the GNN increases the signal efficiency by 18% at a fixed\nfalse positive rate (FPR), compared to current IceCube methods. Alternatively,\nthe GNN offers a reduction of the FPR by over a factor 8 (to below half a\npercent) at a fixed signal efficiency. For the reconstruction of energy,\ndirection, and interaction vertex, the resolution improves by an average of\n13%-20% compared to current maximum likelihood techniques in the energy range\nof 1-30 GeV. The GNN, when run on a GPU, is capable of processing IceCube\nevents at a rate nearly double of the median IceCube trigger rate of 2.7 kHz,\nwhich opens the possibility of using low energy neutrinos in online searches\nfor transient events.",

    "abstract": "The variational lower bound (a.k.a. ELBO or free energy) is the central\nobjective for many learning algorithms including algorithms for deep\nunsupervised learning. Learning algorithms change model parameters such that\nthe variational lower bound increases, and until the parameters are close to a\nstationary point of the learning dynamics. In this purely theoretical\ncontribution, we show that (for a very large class of generative models) the\nvariational lower bound is at all stationary points of learning equal to a sum\nof entropies. For models with one set of latents and one set observed\nvariables, the sum consists of three entropies: (A) the (average) entropy of\nthe variational distributions, (B) the negative entropy of the model's prior\ndistribution, and (C) the (expected) negative entropy of the observable\ndistributions. The obtained result applies under realistic conditions\nincluding: finite numbers of data points, at any stationary points (including\nsaddle points) and for any family of (well behaved) variational distributions.\nThe class of generative models for which we show the equality to entropy sums\ncontains many (and presumably most) standard generative models (including deep\nmodels). As concrete examples we discuss probabilistic PCA and Sigmoid Belief\nNetworks. The prerequisites we use to show equality to entropy sums are\nrelatively mild. Concretely, the distributions of a given generative model have\nto be of the exponential family (with constant base measure), and a model has\nto satisfy a parameterization criterion (which is usually fulfilled). Proving\nthe equality of the ELBO to entropy sums at stationary points (under the stated\nconditions) is the main contribution of this work.",

    "abstract": "Human anatomy, morphology, and associated diseases can be studied using\nmedical imaging data. However, access to medical imaging data is restricted by\ngovernance and privacy concerns, data ownership, and the cost of acquisition,\nthus limiting our ability to understand the human body. A possible solution to\nthis issue is the creation of a model able to learn and then generate synthetic\nimages of the human body conditioned on specific characteristics of relevance\n(e.g., age, sex, and disease status). Deep generative models, in the form of\nneural networks, have been recently used to create synthetic 2D images of\nnatural scenes. Still, the ability to produce high-resolution 3D volumetric\nimaging data with correct anatomical morphology has been hampered by data\nscarcity and algorithmic and computational limitations. This work proposes a\ngenerative model that can be scaled to produce anatomically correct,\nhigh-resolution, and realistic images of the human brain, with the necessary\nquality to allow further downstream analyses. The ability to generate a\npotentially unlimited amount of data not only enables large-scale studies of\nhuman anatomy and pathology without jeopardizing patient privacy, but also\nsignificantly advances research in the field of anomaly detection, modality\nsynthesis, learning under limited data, and fair and ethical AI.

Algorithms designed in this framework usually require some\ngeometrical description of the manifold, which typically includes tangent\nspaces, retractions, and gradients of the cost function. However, in many\ncases, only a subset (or none at all) of these elements can be accessed due to\nlack of information or intractability. In this paper, we propose a novel\napproach that can perform approximate Riemannian optimization in such cases,\nwhere the constraining manifold is a submanifold of $\\R^{D}$. At the bare\nminimum, our method requires only a noiseless sample set of the cost function\n$(\\x_{i}, y_{i})\\in {\\mathcal{M}} \\times \\mathbb{R}$ and the intrinsic\ndimension of the manifold $\\mathcal{M}$.

It is trivial\nthat $p_\\mathrm{E}(H) \\le p_\\mathrm{crit}(H)$, and the so-called \"second\nKahn-Kalai conjecture\" states that $p_\\mathrm{crit}(H) \\lesssim p_\\mathrm{E}(H)\n\\log e(H)$ where $e(H)$ is the number of edges in $H$.\nIn this article, we present a natural modification $p_\\mathrm{E, new}(H)$ of\nthe Kahn--Kalai subgraph expectation threshold, which we show is sandwiched\nbetween $p_\\mathrm{E}(H)$ and $p_\\mathrm{crit}(H)$. The new definition\n$p_\\mathrm{E, new}(H)$ is based on the simple observation that if $G(n,p)$\ncontains a copy of $H$ and $H$ contains \\emph{many} copies of $H'$, then\n$G(n,p)$ must also contain \\emph{many} copies of $H'$. We then show that\n$p_\\mathrm{crit}(H) \\lesssim p_\\mathrm{E, new}(H) \\log e(H)$, thus proving a\nmodification of the second Kahn--Kalai conjecture. The bound follows by a\ndirect application of the set-theoretic \"spread\" property, which led to recent\nbreakthroughs in the sunflower conjecture by Alweiss, Lovett, Wu and Zhang and\nthe first fractional Kahn--Kalai conjecture by Frankston, Kahn, Narayanan and\nPark.",

    "title": "Minimum-entropy causal inference and its application in brain network  analysis",
    "abstract": "Identification of the causal relationship between multivariate time series is\na ubiquitous problem in data science. Granger causality measure (GCM) and\nconditional Granger causality measure (cGCM) are widely used statistical\nmethods for causal inference and effective connectivity analysis in\nneuroimaging research. Both GCM and cGCM have frequency-domain formulations\nthat are developed based on a heuristic algorithm for matrix decompositions.\nThe goal of this work is to generalize GCM and cGCM measures and their\nfrequency-domain formulations by using a theoretic framework for minimum\nentropy (ME) estimation. The proposed ME-estimation method extends the\nclassical theory of minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimation for stochastic\nprocesses. It provides three formulations of cGCM that include Geweke's\noriginal time-domain cGCM as a special case. But all three frequency-domain\nformulations of cGCM are different from previous methods. Experimental results\nbased on simulations have shown that one of the proposed frequency-domain cGCM\nhas enhanced sensitivity and specificity in detecting network connections\ncompared to other methods. In an example based on in vivo functional magnetic\nresonance imaging, the proposed frequency-domain measure cGCM can significantly\nenhance the consistency between the structural and effective connectivity of\nhuman brain networks.",

    "abstract": "Multiport interferometers based on integrated beamsplitter meshes have\nrecently captured interest as a platform for many emerging technologies. In\nthis paper, we present a novel architecture for multiport interferometers based\non the Sine-Cosine fractal decomposition of a unitary matrix. Our architecture\nis unique in that it is self-similar, enabling the construction of modular\nmulti-chiplet devices. Due to this modularity, our design enjoys improved\nresilience to hardware imperfections as compared to conventional multiport\ninterferometers. Additionally, the structure of our circuit enables systematic\ntruncation, which is key in reducing the hardware footprint of the chip as well\nas compute time in training optical neural networks, while maintaining full\nconnectivity. Numerical simulations show that truncation of these meshes gives\nrobust performance even under large fabrication errors. This design is a step\nforward in the construction of large-scale programmable photonics, removing a\nmajor hurdle in scaling up to practical machine learning and quantum computing\napplications.",
