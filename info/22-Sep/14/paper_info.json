    "title": "Leveraging Language Foundation Models for Human Mobility Forecasting",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel pipeline that leverages language foundation\nmodels for temporal sequential pattern mining, such as for human mobility\nforecasting tasks. For example, in the task of predicting Place-of-Interest\n(POI) customer flows, typically the number of visits is extracted from\nhistorical logs, and only the numerical data are used to predict visitor flows.\nIn this research, we perform the forecasting task directly on the natural\nlanguage input that includes all kinds of information such as numerical values\nand contextual semantic information. Specific prompts are introduced to\ntransform numerical temporal sequences into sentences so that existing language\nmodels can be directly applied. We design an AuxMobLCast pipeline for\npredicting the number of visitors in each POI, integrating an auxiliary POI\ncategory classification task with the encoder-decoder architecture. This\nresearch provides empirical evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed\nAuxMobLCast pipeline to discover sequential patterns in mobility forecasting\ntasks. The results, evaluated on three real-world datasets, demonstrate that\npre-trained language foundation models also have good performance in\nforecasting temporal sequences. This study could provide visionary insights and\nlead to new research directions for predicting human mobility.",

    "abstract": "Human-system interface is one of the key advanced design features applied to\nmodern digital instrumentation and control systems of nuclear power plants. The\nconventional design is based on a compact workstation-based system within the\ncontrol room. The compact workstation provides both a strategic operating\nenvironment while also a convenient display for plant status information\nnecessary to the operator. The control environment is further enhanced through\ndisplay panels, visual and auditory alarms, and procedure systems. However,\njust like the legacy control, the HSI should incorporate diversity to\ndemonstrate sufficient defense-in-depth protection against common cause\nfailures of the safety system. Furthermore, the vulnerability of the HSI is\naffected by a plethora of factors, such as human error, cyberattacks, software\ncommon cause failures, etc., that complicate the design and analysis.\nTherefore, this work aims to identify and evaluate existing system\nvulnerabilities to support the licensing, deployment and operation of HSI\ndesigns, especially the functions that are relevant to a reactor trip. We\nperformed a systematic hazard analysis to investigate potential vulnerabilities\nwithin the HSI design using the novel redundancy-guided systems-theoretic\nhazard analysis. This method was developed and demonstrated by Idaho National\nLaboratory under a project initiated by the Risk-Informed Systems Analysis\nPathway of the U.S. Department of Energy's Light Water Reactor Sustainability\nProgram. The goal of the project is to develop a strong technical basis for\nrisk assessment strategies to support effective, reliable, and licensable\ndigital instrumentation and control technologies.",

    "abstract": "Although artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant progress in\nunderstanding molecules in a wide range of fields, existing models generally\nacquire the single cognitive ability from the single molecular modality. Since\nthe hierarchy of molecular knowledge is profound, even humans learn from\ndifferent modalities including both intuitive diagrams and professional texts\nto assist their understanding. Inspired by this, we propose a molecular\nmultimodal foundation model which is pretrained from molecular graphs and their\nsemantically related textual data (crawled from published Scientific Citation\nIndex papers) via contrastive learning. This AI model represents a critical\nattempt that directly bridges molecular graphs and natural language.\nImportantly, through capturing the specific and complementary information of\nthe two modalities, our proposed model can better grasp molecular expertise.\nExperimental results show that our model not only exhibits promising\nperformance in cross-modal tasks such as cross-modal retrieval and molecule\ncaption, but also enhances molecular property prediction and possesses\ncapability to generate meaningful molecular graphs from natural language\ndescriptions. We believe that our model would have a broad impact on\nAI-empowered fields across disciplines such as biology, chemistry, materials,\nenvironment, and medicine, among others.",

    "abstract": "Social media platforms (SMPs) leverage algorithmic filtering (AF) as a means\nof selecting the content that constitutes a user's feed with the aim of\nmaximizing their rewards. Selectively choosing the contents to be shown on the\nuser's feed may yield a certain extent of influence, either minor or major, on\nthe user's decision-making, compared to what it would have been under a\nnatural/fair content selection. As we have witnessed over the past decade,\nalgorithmic filtering can cause detrimental side effects, ranging from biasing\nindividual decisions to shaping those of society as a whole, for example,\ndiverting users' attention from whether to get the COVID-19 vaccine or inducing\nthe public to choose a presidential candidate. The government's constant\nattempts to regulate the adverse effects of AF are often complicated, due to\nbureaucracy, legal affairs, and financial considerations. On the other hand\nSMPs seek to monitor their own algorithmic activities to avoid being fined for\nexceeding the allowable threshold. In this paper, we mathematically formalize\nthis framework and utilize it to construct a data-driven statistical algorithm\nto regulate the AF from deflecting users' beliefs over time, along with sample\nand complexity guarantees. We show that our algorithm is robust against\npotential adversarial users. This state-of-the-art algorithm can be used either\nby authorities acting as external regulators or by SMPs for self-regulation.",

More concretely, we\nhave defined a function SecQuery() that, given an FGAC policy S and a SQL\nselect-statement q, generates a SQL stored-procedure SecQuery(S, q), such that:\nif a user u with role r is authorised, according to S, to execute q based on\nthe current state of the database, then calling SecQuery(S, q)(u, r) returns\nthe same result as when u executes q; otherwise, if the user u is not\nauthorised, according to S, to execute q based on the current state of the\ndatabase, then calling SecQuery(S, q)(u, r) signals an error. Not surprisingly,\nexecuting the query q takes less time than calling the corresponding\nstored-procedure SecQuery(S, q). Here we propose a model-based methodology for\noptimising the stored-procedures generated by the function SecQuery(). The idea\nis to eliminate authorisation checks in the body of the stored-procedures\ngenerated by SecQuery(), when they can be proved to be unnecessary. Based on\nour previous mapping from the Object Constraint Language (OCL) to many-sorted\nfirst-order logic, we can attempt to prove that authorisation checks are\nunnecessary by using SMT solvers.

    "abstract": "Bulk bitwise operations, i.e., bitwise operations on large bit vectors, are\nprevalent in a wide range of important application domains, including\ndatabases, graph processing, genome analysis, cryptography, and\nhyper-dimensional computing. In conventional systems, the performance and\nenergy efficiency of bulk bitwise operations are bottlenecked by data movement\nbetween the compute units and the memory hierarchy. In-flash processing (i.e.,\nprocessing data inside NAND flash chips) has a high potential to accelerate\nbulk bitwise operations by fundamentally reducing data movement through the\nentire memory hierarchy. We identify two key limitations of the\nstate-of-the-art in-flash processing technique for bulk bitwise operations; (i)\nit falls short of maximally exploiting the bit-level parallelism of bulk\nbitwise operations; (ii) it is unreliable because it does not consider the\nhighly error-prone nature of NAND flash memory. We propose Flash-Cosmos (Flash\nComputation with One-Shot Multi-Operand Sensing), a new in-flash processing\ntechnique that significantly increases the performance and energy efficiency of\nbulk bitwise operations while providing high reliability. Flash-Cosmos\nintroduces two key mechanisms that can be easily supported in modern NAND flash\nchips: (i) Multi-Wordline Sensing (MWS), which enables bulk bitwise operations\non a large number of operands with a single sensing operation, and (ii)\nEnhanced SLC-mode Programming (ESP), which enables reliable computation inside\nNAND flash memory. We demonstrate the feasibility of performing bulk bitwise\noperations with high reliability in Flash-Cosmos by testing 160 real 3D NAND\nflash chips. Our evaluation shows that Flash-Cosmos improves average\nperformance and energy efficiency by 3.5x/32x and 3.3x/95x, respectively, over\nthe state-of-the-art in-flash/outside-storage processing techniques across\nthree real-world applications.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a sampling-based trajectory planning algorithm for a\nlaboratory-scale 3D gantry crane in an environment with static obstacles and\nsubject to bounds on the velocity and acceleration of the gantry crane system\nis presented. The focus is on developing a fast motion planning algorithm for\ndifferentially flat systems, where intermediate results can be stored and\nreused for further tasks, such as replanning. The proposed approach is based on\nthe informed optimal rapidly exploring random tree algorithm (informed RRT*),\nwhich is utilized to build trajectory trees that are reused for replanning when\nthe start and/or target states change. In contrast to state-of-the-art\napproaches, the proposed motion planning algorithm incorporates a linear\nquadratic minimum time (LQTM) local planner. Thus, dynamic properties such as\ntime optimality and the smoothness of the trajectory are directly considered in\nthe proposed algorithm. Moreover, by integrating the branch-and-bound method to\nperform the pruning process on the trajectory tree, the proposed algorithm can\neliminate points in the tree that do not contribute to finding better\nsolutions. This helps to curb memory consumption and reduce the computational\ncomplexity during motion (re)planning. Simulation results for a validated\nmathematical model of a 3D gantry crane show the feasibility of the proposed\napproach.",

The resource is modeled as a discrete\ntime dynamical system over which a player can gain control after spending a\nstate-dependent amount of energy at each time step. We use a FlipIT-inspired\ndeterministic model that decides which player is in control at every time step.\nA player's policy is the probability with which the player should spend energy\nto gain control at each time step. Our main results are three-fold. First, we\npresent analytic expressions for the cost-to-go as a function of the hybrid\nstate of the system, i.e., the physical state of the dynamical system and the\nbinary \\texttt{FlipDyn} state for any general system with arbitrary costs.\nThese expressions are exact when the physical state is also discrete and has\nfinite cardinality. Second, for a continuous physical state with linear\ndynamics and quadratic costs, we derive expressions for Nash equilibrium (NE).\nFor scalar physical states, we show that the NE depends only on the parameters\nof the value function and costs, and is independent of the state. Third, we\nderive an approximate value function for higher dimensional linear systems with\nquadratic costs. Finally, we illustrate our results through a numerical study\non the problem of controlling a linear system in a given environment in the\npresence of an adversary.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) aims to perform privacy-preserving machine learning\non distributed data held by multiple data owners. To this end, FL requires the\ndata owners to perform training locally and share the gradient updates (instead\nof the private inputs) with the central server, which are then securely\naggregated over multiple data owners. Although aggregation by itself does not\nprovably offer privacy protection, prior work showed that it may suffice if the\nbatch size is sufficiently large. In this paper, we propose the Cocktail Party\nAttack (CPA) that, contrary to prior belief, is able to recover the private\ninputs from gradients aggregated over a very large batch size. CPA leverages\nthe crucial insight that aggregate gradients from a fully connected layer is a\nlinear combination of its inputs, which leads us to frame gradient inversion as\na blind source separation (BSS) problem (informally called the cocktail party\nproblem). We adapt independent component analysis (ICA)--a classic solution to\nthe BSS problem--to recover private inputs for fully-connected and\nconvolutional networks, and show that CPA significantly outperforms prior\ngradient inversion attacks, scales to ImageNet-sized inputs, and works on large\nbatch sizes of up to 1024.",

In this paper, we propose CenterFormer, a center-based transformer\nnetwork for 3D object detection. CenterFormer first uses a center heatmap to\nselect center candidates on top of a standard voxel-based point cloud encoder.\nIt then uses the feature of the center candidate as the query embedding in the\ntransformer. To further aggregate features from multiple frames, we design an\napproach to fuse features through cross-attention. Lastly, regression heads are\nadded to predict the bounding box on the output center feature representation.\nOur design reduces the convergence difficulty and computational complexity of\nthe transformer structure. The results show significant improvements over the\nstrong baseline of anchor-free object detection networks. CenterFormer achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance for a single model on the Waymo Open Dataset, with\n73.7% mAPH on the validation set and 75.6% mAPH on the test set, significantly\noutperforming all previously published CNN and transformer-based methods.

In this context, mobile\ndevices can be used to collect data about students and to better understand how\ntheir day-to-day routines can influence their academic performance. Moreover,\nthe Covid-19 pandemic led to new challenges and difficulties, also for\nstudents, with considerable impact on their lifestyle. In this paper we present\na dataset collected using a smartphone application (ISABELA), which include\npassive data (e.g., activity and location) as well as self-reported data from\nquestionnaires. We present several tests with different machine learning\nmodels, in order to classify students' performance. These tests were carried\nout using different time windows, showing that weekly time windows lead to\nbetter prediction and classification results than monthly time windows.\nFurthermore, it is shown that the created models can predict student\nperformance even with data collected from different contexts, namely before and\nduring the Covid-19 pandemic. SVMs, XGBoost and AdaBoost-SAMME with Random\nForest were found to be the best algorithms, showing an accuracy greater than\n78%. Additionally, we propose a pipeline that uses a decision level median\nvoting algorithm to further improve the models' performance, by using historic\ndata from the students to further improve the prediction. Using this pipeline,\nit is possible to further increase the performance of the models, with some of\nthem obtaining an accuracy greater than 90%.",

    "abstract": "Causal discovery (CD) from time-varying data is important in neuroscience,\nmedicine, and machine learning. Techniques for CD include randomized\nexperiments which are generally unbiased but expensive. It also includes\nalgorithms like regression, matching, and Granger causality, which are only\ncorrect under strong assumptions made by human designers. However, as we found\nin other areas of machine learning, humans are usually not quite right and are\nusually outperformed by data-driven approaches. Here we test if we can improve\ncausal discovery in a data-driven way. We take a system with a large number of\ncausal components (transistors), the MOS 6502 processor, and meta-learn the\ncausal discovery procedure represented as a neural network. We find that this\nprocedure far outperforms human-designed causal discovery procedures, such as\nMutual Information and Granger Causality. We argue that the causality field\nshould consider, where possible, a supervised approach, where CD procedures are\nlearned from large datasets with known causal relations instead of being\ndesigned by a human specialist. Our findings promise a new approach toward CD\nin neural and medical data and for the broader machine learning community.",

Here, we show how\noptimizing for existing computational and economic definitions of fairness and\nequality fail to prevent unequal social relations. To do this, we provide an\nexample of a self-confirming equilibrium in a simple hiring market that is\nrelationally unequal but satisfies existing distributional notions of fairness.\nIn doing so, we introduce a notion of blatant relational unfairness for\ncomplete-information games, and discuss how this definition helps initiate a\nnew approach to incorporating relational equality into computational systems.",

    "abstract": "Wrist-worn haptic interfaces can deliver a wide range of tactile cues for\ncommunication of information and interaction with virtual objects. Unlike\nfingertips, the wrist and forearm provide a considerably large area of skin\nthat allows the placement of multiple haptic actuators as a display for\nenriching tactile information transfer with minimal encumbrance. Existing\nmulti-degree-of-freedom (DoF) wrist-worn devices employ traditional rigid\nrobotic mechanisms and electric motors that limit their versatility,\nminiaturization, distribution, and assembly. Alternative solutions based on\nsoft elastomeric actuator arrays constitute only 1-DoF haptic pixels.\nHigher-DoF prototypes produce a single interaction point and require complex\nmanual assembly processes, such as molding and gluing several parts. These\napproaches limit the construction of high-DoF compact haptic displays,\nrepeatability, and customizability. Here we present a novel, fully 3D-printed,\nsoft, wearable haptic display for increasing tactile information transfer on\nthe wrist and forearm with 3-DoF haptic voxels, called hoxels. Our initial\nprototype comprises two hoxels that provide skin shear, pressure, twist,\nstretch, squeeze, and other arbitrary stimuli.

    "abstract": "Risk assessment of roadways is commonly practiced based on historical crash\ndata. Information on driver behaviors and real-time traffic situations is\nsometimes missing. In this paper, the Safe Route Mapping (SRM) model, a\nmethodology for developing dynamic risk heat maps of roadways, is extended to\nconsider driver behaviors when making predictions. An Android App is designed\nto gather drivers' information and upload it to a server. On the server, facial\nrecognition extracts drivers' data, such as facial landmarks, gaze directions,\nand emotions. The driver's drowsiness and distraction are detected, and driving\nperformance is evaluated. Meanwhile, dynamic traffic information is captured by\na roadside camera and uploaded to the same server. A\nlongitudinal-scanline-based arterial traffic video analytics is applied to\nrecognize vehicles from the video to build speed and trajectory profiles. Based\non these data, a LightGBM model is introduced to predict conflict indices for\ndrivers in the next one or two seconds. Then, multiple data sources, including\nhistorical crash counts and predicted traffic conflict indicators, are combined\nusing a Fuzzy logic model to calculate risk scores for road segments. The\nproposed SRM model is illustrated using data collected from an actual traffic\nintersection and a driving simulation platform. The prediction results show\nthat the model is accurate, and the added driver behavior features will improve\nthe model's performance. Finally, risk heat maps are generated for\nvisualization purposes. The authorities can use the dynamic heat map to\ndesignate safe corridors and dispatch law enforcement and drivers for early\nwarning and trip planning.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of distributed energy resources (DERs) im-poses new\nchallenges to distribution system operation, e.g., power quality issues. To\novercome these challenges and enhance system operation, it is critical to\neffectively utilize all available resources and accurately characterize\nunbalanced distribution networks in operational tools. This paper proposes a\nconvex second-order-cone programming (SOCP)-based AC optimal power flow (ACOPF)\nmodel for three-phase unbalanced distribution net-works, including smart\ninverters and Volt-VAr controller (VVC) devices. Reactive power-voltage (Q-V)\ncharacteristics of smart inverters of solar photovoltaic (PV) units are also\nmodeled. More-over, the settings of Q-V characteristics of VVC are co-optimized\nwithin the proposed ACOPF, considering the allowable range of the IEEE\n1547-2018 standard. Furthermore, dynamic analyses are conducted to verify the\nstability of optimal settings of VVC. The proposed models are tested on an\nactual 1747-node primary distribution feeder in Arizona. The results illustrate\nthe effective-ness of the proposed ACOPF for unbalanced systems in provid-ing a\nglobal optimal solution while capturing the non-linearity and non-convexity of\nACOPF. By co-optimizing settings, system operation is improved due to the\nflexibility of adjusting reactive power output from PV units with VVC. The\ntime-domain simu-lations show that the optimal settings result in a stable\nsystem",

While prior neural approaches have often treated this as a\nsequence tagging problem with independent predictions, we put forward a\nchecklist system, trained via reinforcement learning, that maintains a\nrepresentation of recent predictions in addition to a hidden state, allowing it\nto learn soft constraints on output structure. We also demonstrate that by\nmodifying input representations -- which in prior work using neural models have\noften taken the form of one-hot encodings over individual keys on the piano --\nto encode relative position on the keyboard to the prior note instead, we can\nachieve much better performance.

To\nthis end, we compare methods across several statistics which track the\nfrequency of adjacent finger predictions that while independently reasonable\nwould be physically challenging to perform in sequence, and implement a\nreinforcement learning strategy to minimize these as part of our training loss.\nFinally through human expert evaluation, we demonstrate significant gains in\nperformability directly attributable to improvements with respect to these\nmetrics.",

    "abstract": "Deep Linear and Nonlinear learning methods have already been vital machine\nlearning methods for investigating the hierarchical features such as functional\nconnectivity in the human brain via functional Magnetic Resonance signals;\nhowever, there are three major shortcomings: 1). For deep linear learning\nmethods, although the identified hierarchy of functional connectivity is easily\nexplainable, it is challenging to reveal more hierarchical functional\nconnectivity; 2). For deep nonlinear learning methods, although non-fully\nconnected architecture reduces the complexity of neural network structures that\nare easy to optimize and not vulnerable to overfitting, the functional\nconnectivity hierarchy is difficult to explain; 3). Importantly, it is\nchallenging for Deep Linear/Nonlinear methods to detect meta and sub-functional\nconnectivity even in the shallow layers; 4). Like most conventional Deep\nNonlinear Methods, such as Deep Neural Networks, the hyperparameters must be\ntuned manually, which is time-consuming. Thus, in this work, we propose a novel\ndeep hybrid learning method named SEmi-Nonlinear Deep Efficient Reconstruction\n(SENDER), to overcome the aforementioned shortcomings: 1). SENDER utilizes a\nmultiple-layer stacked structure for the linear learning methods to detect the\ncanonical functional connectivity; 2). SENDER implements a non-fully connected\narchitecture conducted for the nonlinear learning methods to reveal the\nmeta-functional connectivity through shallow and deeper layers; 3). SENDER\nincorporates the proposed background components to extract the sub-functional\nconnectivity; 4).

    "abstract": "Recently there is an increasing scholarly interest in time-varying knowledge\ngraphs, or temporal knowledge graphs (TKG). Previous research suggests diverse\napproaches to TKG reasoning that uses historical information. However, less\nattention has been given to the hierarchies within such information at\ndifferent timestamps. Given that TKG is a sequence of knowledge graphs based on\ntime, the chronology in the sequence derives hierarchies between the graphs.\nFurthermore, each knowledge graph has its hierarchical level which may differ\nfrom one another. To address these hierarchical characteristics in TKG, we\npropose HyperVC, which utilizes hyperbolic space that better encodes the\nhierarchies than Euclidean space. The chronological hierarchies between\nknowledge graphs at different timestamps are represented by embedding the\nknowledge graphs as vectors in a common hyperbolic space. Additionally, diverse\nhierarchical levels of knowledge graphs are represented by adjusting the\ncurvatures of hyperbolic embeddings of their entities and relations.\nExperiments on four benchmark datasets show substantial improvements,\nespecially on the datasets with higher hierarchical levels.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates user scheduling and trajectory optimization for a\nnetwork supported by an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) mounted on an\nunmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The IRS is powered via the simultaneous wireless\ninformation and power transfer (SWIPT) technique. The IRS boosts users' uplink\nsignals to improve the network's longevity and energy efficiency. It\nsimultaneously harvests energy with a non-linear energy harvesting circuit and\nreflects the incident signals by controlling its reflection coefficients and\nphase shifts. The trajectory of the UAV impacts the efficiency of these\noperations. We minimize the maximum energy consumption of all users by joint\noptimization of user scheduling, UAV trajectory/velocity, and IRS phase\nshifts/reflection coefficients while guaranteeing each user's minimum required\ndata rate and harvested energy of the IRS. We first derive a closed-form\nsolution for the IRS phase shifts and then address the non-convexity of the\ncritical problem. Finally, we propose an alternating optimization (AO)\nalgorithm to optimize the remaining variables iteratively. We demonstrate the\ngains over several benchmarks. For instance, with a 50-element IRS, min-max\nenergy consumption can be as low as 0.0404 (Joule), a 7.13% improvement over\nthe No IRS case (achieving 0.0435 (Joule)). We also show that IRS-UAV without\nEH performs best at the cost of circuit power consumption of the IRS (a 20%\nimprovement over the No IRS case).",

    "abstract": "Video action segmentation and recognition tasks have been widely applied in\nmany fields. Most previous studies employ large-scale, high computational\nvisual models to understand videos comprehensively. However, few studies\ndirectly employ the graph model to reason about the video. The graph model\nprovides the benefits of fewer parameters, low computational cost, a large\nreceptive field, and flexible neighborhood message aggregation. In this paper,\nwe present a graph-based method named Semantic2Graph, to turn the video action\nsegmentation and recognition problem into node classification of graphs. To\npreserve fine-grained relations in videos, we construct the graph structure of\nvideos at the frame-level and design three types of edges: temporal, semantic,\nand self-loop. We combine visual, structural, and semantic features as node\nattributes. Semantic edges are used to model long-term spatio-temporal\nrelations, while the semantic features are the embedding of the label-text\nbased on the textual prompt. A Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) model is used to\nlearn multi-modal feature fusion. Experimental results show that Semantic2Graph\nachieves improvement on GTEA and 50Salads, compared to the state-of-the-art\nresults.

The RPM permits exact maximum likelihood learning in settings\nwith discrete latents and a tractable prior, even when the mapping between\ncontinuous observations and the latents is expressed through a flexible model\nsuch as a neural network. We develop effective approximations for the case of\ncontinuous latent variables with tractable priors. Unlike the approximations\nnecessary in dual-parametrised models such as Helmholtz machines and\nvariational autoencoders, these RPM approximations introduce only minor bias,\nwhich may often vanish asymptotically. Furthermore, where the prior on latents\nis intractable the RPM may be combined effectively with standard probabilistic\ntechniques such as variational Bayes.

Our approach consists of two steps: First, using the fact that a\nmotion in the task space of the robot can be approximated by using a sequence\nof constant screw motions, we segment a human demonstration into a sequence of\nconstant screw motions. Second, we use the segmented screws to generate motion\nplans via screw-linear interpolation for other instances of the same task.

    "abstract": "A line of work has looked at the problem of recovering an input from distance\nqueries. In this setting, there is an unknown sequence $s \\in \\{0,1\\}^{\\leq\nn}$, and one chooses a set of queries $y \\in \\{0,1\\}^{\\mathcal{O}(n)}$ and\nreceives $d(s,y)$ for a distance function $d$. The goal is to make as few\nqueries as possible to recover $s$. Although this problem is well-studied for\ndecomposable distances, i.e., distances of the form $d(s,y) = \\sum_{i=1}^n\nf(s_i, y_i)$ for some function $f$, which includes the important cases of\nHamming distance, $\\ell_p$-norms, and $M$-estimators, to the best of our\nknowledge this problem has not been studied for non-decomposable distances, for\nwhich there are important special cases such as edit distance, dynamic time\nwarping (DTW), Frechet distance, earth mover's distance, and so on. We initiate\nthe study and develop a general framework for such distances. Interestingly,\nfor some distances such as DTW or Frechet, exact recovery of the sequence $s$\nis provably impossible, and so we show by allowing the characters in $y$ to be\ndrawn from a slightly larger alphabet this then becomes possible. In a number\nof cases we obtain optimal or near-optimal query complexity. We also study the\nrole of adaptivity for a number of different distance functions. One motivation\nfor understanding non-adaptivity is that the query sequence can be fixed and\nthe distances of the input to the queries provide a non-linear embedding of the\ninput, which can be used in downstream applications involving, e.g., neural\nnetworks for natural language processing.",

    "abstract": "Data-free quantization can potentially address data privacy and security\nconcerns in model compression, and thus has been widely investigated. Recently,\nPSAQ-ViT designs a relative value metric, patch similarity, to generate data\nfrom pre-trained vision transformers (ViTs), achieving the first attempt at\ndata-free quantization for ViTs. In this paper, we propose PSAQ-ViT V2, a more\naccurate and general data-free quantization framework for ViTs, built on top of\nPSAQ-ViT. More specifically, following the patch similarity metric in PSAQ-ViT,\nwe introduce an adaptive teacher-student strategy, which facilitates the\nconstant cyclic evolution of the generated samples and the quantized model\n(student) in a competitive and interactive fashion under the supervision of the\nfull-precision model (teacher), thus significantly improving the accuracy of\nthe quantized model. Moreover, without the auxiliary category guidance, we\nemploy the task- and model-independent prior information, making the\ngeneral-purpose scheme compatible with a broad range of vision tasks and\nmodels. Extensive experiments are conducted on various models on image\nclassification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks, and PSAQ-ViT\nV2, with the naive quantization strategy and without access to real-world data,\nconsistently achieves competitive results, showing potential as a powerful\nbaseline on data-free quantization for ViTs.

While the post-editing effort can be used to measure the translation\nquality to some extent, we find it usually conflicts with the human judgement\non whether the word is well or poorly translated. To overcome the limitation,\nwe first create a golden benchmark dataset, namely \\emph{HJQE} (Human Judgement\non Quality Estimation), where the expert translators directly annotate the\npoorly translated words on their judgements. Additionally, to further make use\nof the parallel corpus, we propose the self-supervised pre-training with two\ntag correcting strategies, namely tag refinement strategy and tree-based\nannotation strategy, to make the TER-based artificial QE corpus closer to\n\\emph{HJQE}.

Toward the first objective, we study the\nlearning iterates obtained by independent learners, and we use recent results\nfrom POMDP theory to show that these iterates converge under mild conditions.\nIn particular, we consider four information structures corresponding to\ninformation at each agent: (1) global state + local action; (2) local state,\nmean-field state + local action; (3) local state, compressed mean-field state +\nlocal action; (4) local state with local action. We present a notion of\nsubjective equilibrium suitable for the analysis of independent learners.\nToward the second objective, we study a family of dynamical systems on the set\nof joint policies. The dynamical systems under consideration are subject to a\nso-called $\\epsilon$-satisficing condition: agents who are subjectively\n$\\epsilon$-best-responding at a given joint policy do not change their policy.\nWe establish a useful structural property relating to such dynamical systems.\nFinally, we develop an independent learning algorithm for $N$-player mean-field\ngames that drives play to subjective $\\epsilon$-equilibrium under self-play,\nexploiting the aforementioned structural properties to guarantee convergence of\npolicies.

As a result, they are unable to adapt to temporal change -- both\ntest distribution shift and deleted training data -- without frequent, costly\nre-training. In this paper, we study temporal adaptation through the task of\nlongitudinal hashtag prediction and propose a non-parametric technique as a\nsimple but effective solution: non-parametric classifiers use datastores which\ncan be updated, either to adapt to test distribution shift or training data\ndeletion, without re-training.

Experimental results\nachieve state-of-the-art performance for the classification of suicidal text,\nboth with traditional methods like logistic regression (F1=0.85), as well as\nwith large-scale pre-trained language models like BERT (F1=0.92). Finally, we\nrelease the Robin dataset publicly as a machine learning resource with the\npotential to drive the next generation of suicidal sentiment research.",

    "abstract": "Traditional LiDAR odometry (LO) systems mainly leverage geometric information\nobtained from the traversed surroundings to register laser scans and estimate\nLiDAR ego-motion, while it may be unreliable in dynamic or unstructured\nenvironments. This paper proposes InTEn-LOAM, a low-drift and robust LiDAR\nodometry and mapping method that fully exploits implicit information of laser\nsweeps (i.e., geometric, intensity, and temporal characteristics). Scanned\npoints are projected to cylindrical images, which facilitate the efficient and\nadaptive extraction of various types of features, i.e., ground, beam, facade,\nand reflector. We propose a novel intensity-based points registration algorithm\nand incorporate it into the LiDAR odometry, enabling the LO system to jointly\nestimate the LiDAR ego-motion using both geometric and intensity feature\npoints. To eliminate the interference of dynamic objects, we propose a\ntemporal-based dynamic object removal approach to filter them out before map\nupdate. Moreover, the local map is organized and downsampled using a\ntemporal-related voxel grid filter to maintain the similarity between the\ncurrent scan and the static local map. Extensive experiments are conducted on\nboth simulated and real-world datasets. The results show that the proposed\nmethod achieves similar or better accuracy w.r.t the state-of-the-arts in\nnormal driving scenarios and outperforms geometric-based LO in unstructured\nenvironments.",

    "abstract": "Molecule generation, especially generating 3D molecular geometries from\nscratch (i.e., 3D \\textit{de novo} generation), has become a fundamental task\nin drug designs. Existing diffusion-based 3D molecule generation methods could\nsuffer from unsatisfactory performances, especially when generating large\nmolecules. At the same time, the generated molecules lack enough diversity.\nThis paper proposes a novel diffusion model to address those two challenges.\nFirst, interatomic relations are not in molecules' 3D point cloud\nrepresentations. Thus, it is difficult for existing generative models to\ncapture the potential interatomic forces and abundant local constraints. To\ntackle this challenge, we propose to augment the potential interatomic forces\nand further involve dual equivariant encoders to encode interatomic forces of\ndifferent strengths. Second, existing diffusion-based models essentially shift\nelements in geometry along the gradient of data density. Such a process lacks\nenough exploration in the intermediate steps of the Langevin dynamics. To\naddress this issue, we introduce a distributional controlling variable in each\ndiffusion/reverse step to enforce thorough explorations and further improve\ngeneration diversity.\nExtensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed\nmodel significantly outperforms existing methods for both unconditional and\nconditional generation tasks.

    "abstract": "Information freshness, characterized by age of information (AoI), is\nimportant for sensor applications involving timely status updates. In many\ncases, the wireless signals from one sensor can be received by multiple access\npoints (APs). This paper investigates the average AoI for cooperative APs, in\nwhich they can share information through a wired backbone network. We first\nstudy a basic backbone-assisted COoperative AP (Co-AP) system where APs share\nonly decoded packets. Experimental results on software-defined radios (SDR)\nindicate that Co-AP significantly improves the average AoI performance over a\nsingle-AP system. Next, we investigate an improved Co-AP system, called\nSoft-Co-AP. In addition to sharing decoded packets, Soft-Co-AP shares and\ncollects soft information of packets that the APs fail to decode for further\njoint decoding. A critical issue in Soft-Co-AP is determining the number of\nquantization bits that represent the soft information (each soft bit) shared\nover the backbone. While more quantization bits per soft bit improves the joint\ndecoding performance, it leads to higher backbone delay. We experimentally\nstudy the average AoI of Soft-Co-AP by evaluating the tradeoff between the\nbackbone delay and the number of quantization bits. SDR experiments show that\nwhen the number of sensors is large, Soft-Co-AP further reduces the average AoI\nby 12% compared with Co-AP. Interestingly, good average AoI performance is\nusually achieved when the number of quantization bits per soft bit is neither\ntoo large nor too small.",

    "abstract": "Internet analysis is a major challenge due to the volume and rate of network\ntraffic. In lieu of analyzing traffic as raw packets, network analysts often\nrely on compressed network flows (netflows) that contain the start time, stop\ntime, source, destination, and number of packets in each direction. However,\nmany traffic analyses benefit from temporal aggregation of multiple\nsimultaneous netflows, which can be computationally challenging. To alleviate\nthis concern, a novel netflow compression and resampling method has been\ndeveloped leveraging GraphBLAS hyperspace traffic matrices that preserve\nanonymization while enabling subrange analysis. Standard multitemporal spatial\nanalyses are then performed on each subrange to generate detailed statistical\naggregates of the source packets, source fan-out, unique links, destination\nfan-in, and destination packets of each subrange which can then be used for\nbackground modeling and anomaly detection. A simple file format based on\nGraphBLAS sparse matrices is developed for storing these statistical\naggregates. This method is scale tested on the MIT SuperCloud using a 50\ntrillion packet netflow corpus from several hundred sites collected over\nseveral months. The resulting compression achieved is significant (<0.1 bit per\npacket) enabling extremely large netflow analyses to be stored and transported.\nThe single node parallel performance is analyzed in terms of both processors\nand threads showing that a single node can perform hundreds of simultaneous\nanalyses at over a million packets/sec (roughly equivalent to a 10 Gigabit\nlink).",

Besides, traditional\nreinforcement learning (RL) methods for traffic control usually converge slowly\nfor lacking data efficiency. Moreover, conventional optimal perimeter control\nschemes require exact knowledge of the system dynamics and thus would be\nfragile to endogenous uncertainties. To handle these challenges, this work\nproposes an integral reinforcement learning (IRL) based approach to learning\nthe macroscopic traffic dynamics for adaptive optimal perimeter control. This\nwork makes the following primary contributions to the transportation\nliterature: (a) A continuous-time control is developed with discrete gain\nupdates to adapt to the discrete-time sensor data. (b) To reduce the sampling\ncomplexity and use the available data more efficiently, the experience replay\n(ER) technique is introduced to the IRL algorithm. (c) The proposed method\nrelaxes the requirement on model calibration in a \"model-free\" manner that\nenables robustness against modeling uncertainty and enhances the real-time\nperformance via a data-driven RL algorithm. (d) The convergence of the\nIRL-based algorithms and the stability of the controlled traffic dynamics are\nproven via the Lyapunov theory. The optimal control law is parameterized and\nthen approximated by neural networks (NN), which moderates the computational\ncomplexity.

However, little is known\nabout the attitudes towards stay-at-home orders expressed on social media\ndespite the fact that social media are central platforms for expressing and\ndebating personal attitudes. To address this gap, we analyze the prevalence and\nframing of attitudes towards stay-at-home policies, as expressed on Twitter in\nthe early months of the pandemic. We focus on three aspects of tweets: whether\nthey contain an attitude towards stay-at-home measures, whether the attitude\nwas for or against, and the moral justification for the attitude, if any. We\ncollect and annotate a dataset of stay-at-home tweets and create classifiers\nthat enable large-scale analysis of the relationship between moral frames and\nstay-at-home attitudes and their temporal evolution. Our findings suggest that\nframes of care are correlated with a supportive stance, whereas freedom and\noppression signify an attitude against stay-at-home directives. There was\nwidespread support for stay-at-home orders in the early weeks of lockdowns,\nfollowed by increased resistance toward the end of May and the beginning of\nJune 2020.

Therefore, we propose R\\'{e}nyi Divergence Deep Mutual Learning\n(RDML). Our empirical results represent the advantage of the marriage of DML\nand the \\renyi{} divergence. The flexible control imposed by the R\\'{e}nyi\ndivergence is able to further improve DML to learn better generalized models.",

    "title": "Adaptive Discretization using Voronoi Trees for Continuous-Action POMDPs",
    "abstract": "Solving Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) with\ncontinuous actions is challenging, particularly for high-dimensional action\nspaces. To alleviate this difficulty, we propose a new sampling-based online\nPOMDP solver, called Adaptive Discretization using Voronoi Trees (ADVT). It\nuses Monte Carlo Tree Search in combination with an adaptive discretization of\nthe action space as well as optimistic optimization to efficiently sample\nhigh-dimensional continuous action spaces and compute the best action to\nperform. Specifically, we adaptively discretize the action space for each\nsampled belief using a hierarchical partition which we call a Voronoi tree. A\nVoronoi tree is a Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) that implicitly maintains the\npartition of a cell as the Voronoi diagram of two points sampled from the cell.\nThis partitioning strategy keeps the cost of partitioning and estimating the\nsize of each cell low, even in high-dimensional spaces where many sampled\npoints are required to cover the space well. ADVT uses the estimated sizes of\nthe cells to form an upper-confidence bound of the action values of the cell,\nand in turn uses the upper-confidence bound to guide the Monte Carlo Tree\nSearch expansion and further discretization of the action space. This strategy\nenables ADVT to better exploit local information in the action space, leading\nto an action space discretization that is more adaptive, and hence more\nefficient in computing good POMDP solutions, compared to existing solvers.\nExperiments on simulations of four types of benchmark problems indicate that\nADVT outperforms and scales substantially better to high-dimensional continuous\naction spaces, compared to state-of-the-art continuous action POMDP solvers.",

    "abstract": "Geography scholarship currently includes interdisciplinary approaches and\ntheories and reflects shifts in research methodologies. Since the spatial turn\nin geographical thought and the emergence of geo-web technologies, geography\nscholarship has leaned more toward interdisciplinarity. In recent years\ngeographical research methods have relied on various disciplines ranging from\ndata science to arts and design. Literary geography and film geography are two\nsubfields of geography that employ novels and films in exploring spatiality,\nrespectively. In addition to geographical concepts, these courses include many\naspects of relations in space, including human-human relations,\nhuman-environment relations, et cetera, which were barely addressed in\ntraditional geography courses. However, a review of the employment of geoweb\ntechnologies in literary and film geography practices reveals that these\npractices have mostly remained limited to isolating geographical passages from\nnovels or movies.

Driven by huge profits, the potential adversary\nhas strong motivation and incentives to manipulate the ranking list. Meanwhile,\nthe intrinsic vulnerability of the rank aggregation methods is not well studied\nin the literature. To fully understand the possible risks, we focus on the\npurposeful adversary who desires to designate the aggregated results by\nmodifying the pairwise data in this paper. From the perspective of the\ndynamical system, the attack behavior with a target ranking list is a fixed\npoint belonging to the composition of the adversary and the victim. To perform\nthe targeted attack, we formulate the interaction between the adversary and the\nvictim as a game-theoretic framework consisting of two continuous operators\nwhile Nash equilibrium is established. Then two procedures against HodgeRank\nand RankCentrality are constructed to produce the modification of the original\ndata. Furthermore, we prove that the victims will produce the target ranking\nlist once the adversary masters the complete information. It is noteworthy that\nthe proposed methods allow the adversary only to hold incomplete information or\nimperfect feedback and perform the purposeful attack. The effectiveness of the\nsuggested target attack strategies is demonstrated by a series of toy\nsimulations and several real-world data experiments. These experimental results\nshow that the proposed methods could achieve the attacker's goal in the sense\nthat the leading candidate of the perturbed ranking list is the designated one\nby the adversary.",

    "abstract": "Most object manipulation strategies for robots are based on the assumption\nthat the object is rigid (i.e., with fixed geometry) and the goal's details\nhave been fully specified (e.g., the exact target pose). However, there are\nmany tasks that involve spatial relations in human environments where these\nconditions may be hard to satisfy, e.g., bending and placing a cable inside an\nunknown container. To develop advanced robotic manipulation capabilities in\nunstructured environments that avoid these assumptions, we propose a novel\nlong-horizon framework that exploits contrastive planning in finding promising\ncollaborative actions. Using simulation data collected by random actions, we\nlearn an embedding model in a contrastive manner that encodes the\nspatio-temporal information from successful experiences, which facilitates the\nsubgoal planning through clustering in the latent space. Based on the keypoint\ncorrespondence-based action parameterization, we design a leader-follower\ncontrol scheme for the collaboration between dual arms. All models of our\npolicy are automatically trained in simulation and can be directly transferred\nto real-world environments.

    "abstract": "The time needed to apply a hierarchical clustering algorithm is most often\ndominated by the number of computations of a pairwise dissimilarity measure.\nSuch a constraint, for larger data sets, puts at a disadvantage the use of all\nthe classical linkage criteria but the single linkage one. However, it is known\nthat the single linkage clustering algorithm is very sensitive to outliers,\nproduces highly skewed dendrograms, and therefore usually does not reflect the\ntrue underlying data structure -- unless the clusters are well-separated. To\novercome its limitations, we propose a new hierarchical clustering linkage\ncriterion called Genie. Namely, our algorithm links two clusters in such a way\nthat a chosen economic inequity measure (e.g., the Gini- or Bonferroni-index)\nof the cluster sizes does not drastically increase above a given threshold. The\npresented benchmarks indicate a high practical usefulness of the introduced\nmethod: it most often outperforms the Ward or average linkage in terms of the\nclustering quality while retaining the single linkage's speed. The Genie\nalgorithm is easily parallelizable and thus may be run on multiple threads to\nspeed up its execution even further. Its memory overhead is small: there is no\nneed to precompute the complete distance matrix to perform the computations in\norder to obtain a desired clustering. It can be applied on arbitrary spaces\nequipped with a dissimilarity measure, e.g., on real vectors, DNA or protein\nsequences, images, rankings, informetric data, etc. A reference implementation\nof the algorithm has been included in the open source 'genie' package for R.\nSee also https://genieclust.gagolewski.com for a new implementation\n(genieclust) -- available for both R and Python.",

Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is an emerging\nparadigm that extends cloud computing capabilities to the edge of the network\ni.e., at the base station level. To meet the latency requirements and avoid the\nend-to-end communication with remote cloud data centers, MEC allows to store\nand process video content (e.g., caching, transcoding, pre-processing) at the\nbase stations. Both video on demand and live video streaming can utilize MEC to\nimprove existing services and develop novel use cases, such as video analytics,\nand targeted advertisements. MEC is expected to reshape the future of video\nstreaming by providing ultra-reliable and low latency streaming (e.g., in\naugmented reality, virtual reality, and autonomous vehicles), pervasive\ncomputing (e.g., in real-time video analytics), and blockchain-enabled\narchitecture for secure live streaming.

However, (CNNs) have a strong and useful inductive\nbias for vision tasks (i.e. translation equivariance and locality). In this\nwork, we developed a novel model architecture that we call a Mobile fish\nlandmark detection network (MFLD-net). We have made this model using\nconvolution operations based on ViT (i.e. Patch embeddings, Multi-Layer\nPerceptrons). MFLD-net can achieve competitive or better results in low data\nregimes while being lightweight and therefore suitable for embedded and mobile\ndevices. Furthermore, we show that MFLD-net can achieve keypoint (landmark)\nestimation accuracies on-par or even better than some of the state-of-the-art\n(CNNs) on a fish image dataset. Additionally, unlike ViT, MFLD-net does not\nneed a pre-trained model and can generalise well when trained on a small\ndataset. We provide quantitative and qualitative results that demonstrate the\nmodel's generalisation capabilities. This work will provide a foundation for\nfuture efforts in developing mobile, but efficient fish monitoring systems and\ndevices.",

    "title": "Self-supervised motion descriptor for cardiac phase detection in 4D CMR  based on discrete vector field estimations",
    "abstract": "Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) sequences visualise the cardiac function\nvoxel-wise over time. Simultaneously, deep learning-based deformable image\nregistration is able to estimate discrete vector fields which warp one time\nstep of a CMR sequence to the following in a self-supervised manner. However,\ndespite the rich source of information included in these 3D+t vector fields, a\nstandardised interpretation is challenging and the clinical applications remain\nlimited so far. In this work, we show how to efficiently use a deformable\nvector field to describe the underlying dynamic process of a cardiac cycle in\nform of a derived 1D motion descriptor. Additionally, based on the expected\ncardiovascular physiological properties of a contracting or relaxing ventricle,\nwe define a set of rules that enables the identification of five cardiovascular\nphases including the end-systole (ES) and end-diastole (ED) without the usage\nof labels. We evaluate the plausibility of the motion descriptor on two\nchallenging multi-disease, -center, -scanner short-axis CMR datasets. First, by\nreporting quantitative measures such as the periodic frame difference for the\nextracted phases. Second, by comparing qualitatively the general pattern when\nwe temporally resample and align the motion descriptors of all instances across\nboth datasets. The average periodic frame difference for the ED, ES key phases\nof our approach is $0.80\\pm{0.85}$, $0.69\\pm{0.79}$ which is slightly better\nthan the inter-observer variability ($1.07\\pm{0.86}$, $0.91\\pm{1.6}$) and the\nsupervised baseline method ($1.18\\pm{1.91}$, $1.21\\pm{1.78}$).

    "abstract": "Neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks: adding well-crafted,\nimperceptible perturbations to their input can modify their output. Adversarial\ntraining is one of the most effective approaches to training robust models\nagainst such attacks. Unfortunately, this method is much slower than vanilla\ntraining of neural networks since it needs to construct adversarial examples\nfor the entire training data at every iteration. By leveraging the theory of\ncoreset selection, we show how selecting a small subset of training data\nprovides a principled approach to reducing the time complexity of robust\ntraining. To this end, we first provide convergence guarantees for adversarial\ncoreset selection. In particular, we show that the convergence bound is\ndirectly related to how well our coresets can approximate the gradient computed\nover the entire training data. Motivated by our theoretical analysis, we\npropose using this gradient approximation error as our adversarial coreset\nselection objective to reduce the training set size effectively. Once built, we\nrun adversarial training over this subset of the training data. Unlike existing\nmethods, our approach can be adapted to a wide variety of training objectives,\nincluding TRADES, $\\ell_p$-PGD, and Perceptual Adversarial Training. We conduct\nextensive experiments to demonstrate that our approach speeds up adversarial\ntraining by 2-3 times while experiencing a slight degradation in the clean and\nrobust accuracy.",

    "abstract": "The organization of fog devices into fog colonies has reduced the complexity\nmanagement of fog domains. One of the main influencing factors on this\ncomplexity is the large number of devices, i.e. the high scale level of the\ninfrastructure. Fog colonies are subsets of fog devices that are managed\nindependently from the other colonies. Thus, the number of devices involved in\nthe management of a colony is much smaller. Previous studies have evaluated the\ninfluence of the fog colony layout on system performance metrics. We propose to\nuse a hierarchical clustering as the base definition of the fog colony layout\nof the fog infrastructure. The dendrogram obtained from this hierarchical\nclustering includes all the colony candidates. A genetic algorithm is in charge\nof selecting the subset of colony candidates that optimizes the two performance\nmetrics under study: the network communication time between users and\napplications, and the execution time of the algorithms that manage internally\nthe placement of the applications in each colony. We implemented the NSGA-II, a\ncommon multi-objective approach for GAs, to evaluate our proposal. The results\nshow that a meta-heuristic such as a GA improves the performance metrics by\ndefining the fog colony layout through the use of the dendrogram. Nine\ndifferent experiment scenarios, varying the number of applications and fog\ndevices, were studied. In the worst of the cases, 137 generations were enough\nto the results of the GA dominated the solutions obtained with two control\nalgorithms. The number of genetic solutions and their homogeneous distribution\nin the Pareto front were also satisfactory.",

    "abstract": "Robotic cloth manipulation is a relevant challenging problem for autonomous\nrobotic systems. Highly deformable objects as textile items can adopt multiple\nconfigurations and shapes during their manipulation. Hence, robots should not\nonly understand the current cloth configuration but also be able to predict the\nfuture possible behaviors of the cloth. This paper addresses the problem of\nindirectly controlling the configuration of certain points of a textile object,\nby applying actions on other parts of the object through the use of a Model\nPredictive Control (MPC) strategy, which also allows to foresee the behavior of\nindirectly controlled points. The designed controller finds the optimal control\nsignals to attain the desired future target configuration. The explored\nscenario in this paper considers tracking a reference trajectory with the lower\ncorners of a square piece of cloth by grasping its upper corners. To do so, we\npropose and validate a linear cloth model that allows solving the MPC-related\noptimization problem in real time. Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques are\nused to learn the optimal parameters of the proposed cloth model and also to\ntune the resulting MPC. After obtaining accurate tracking results in\nsimulation, the full control scheme was implemented and executed in a real\nrobot, obtaining accurate tracking even in adverse conditions. While total\nobserved errors reach the 5 cm mark, for a 30x30 cm cloth, an analysis shows\nthe MPC contributes less than 30% to that value.",

The effectiveness of logic\nobfuscation is challenged by the recently introduced Boolean satisfiability\n(SAT) attack and its variants.

    "abstract": "Architectural photography is a genre of photography that focuses on capturing\na building or structure in the foreground with dramatic lighting in the\nbackground. Inspired by recent successes in image-to-image translation methods,\nwe aim to perform style transfer for architectural photographs. However, the\nspecial composition in architectural photography poses great challenges for\nstyle transfer in this type of photographs. Existing neural style transfer\nmethods treat the architectural images as a single entity, which would generate\nmismatched chrominance and destroy geometric features of the original\narchitecture, yielding unrealistic lighting, wrong color rendition, and visual\nartifacts such as ghosting, appearance distortion, or color mismatching. In\nthis paper, we specialize a neural style transfer method for architectural\nphotography. Our method addresses the composition of the foreground and\nbackground in an architectural photograph in a two-branch neural network that\nseparately considers the style transfer of the foreground and the background,\nrespectively. Our method comprises a segmentation module, a learning-based\nimage-to-image translation module, and an image blending optimization module.\nWe trained our image-to-image translation neural network with a new dataset of\nunconstrained outdoor architectural photographs captured at different magic\ntimes of a day, utilizing additional semantic information for better\nchrominance matching and geometry preservation. Our experiments show that our\nmethod can produce photorealistic lighting and color rendition on both the\nforeground and background, and outperforms general image-to-image translation\nand arbitrary style transfer baselines quantitatively and qualitatively.

    "abstract": "Rule mining is an effective approach for reasoning over knowledge graph (KG).\nExisting works mainly concentrate on mining rules. However, there might be\nseveral rules that could be applied for reasoning for one relation, and how to\nselect appropriate rules for completion of different triples has not been\ndiscussed. In this paper, we propose to take the context information into\nconsideration, which helps select suitable rules for the inference tasks. Based\non this idea, we propose a transformer-based rule mining approach, Ruleformer.\nIt consists of two blocks: 1) an encoder extracting the context information\nfrom subgraph of head entities with modified attention mechanism, and 2) a\ndecoder which aggregates the subgraph information from the encoder output and\ngenerates the probability of relations for each step of reasoning. The basic\nidea behind Ruleformer is regarding rule mining process as a sequence to\nsequence task. To make the subgraph a sequence input to the encoder and retain\nthe graph structure, we devise a relational attention mechanism in Transformer.\nThe experiment results show the necessity of considering these information in\nrule mining task and the effectiveness of our model.",

Such kernel functions are frequently encountered in\na wide range of applications such as $N$ body problems, Green's functions,\nintegral equations, geostatistics, kriging, Gaussian processes, etc. One of the\nchallenges in dealing with these kernel functions is that the corresponding\nmatrix associated with these kernels is large and dense and thereby, the\ncomputational cost of matrix operations is high. In this article, we prove new\ntheorems bounding the numerical rank of sub-matrices arising out of these\nkernel functions. Under reasonably mild assumptions, we prove that the rank of\ncertain sub-matrices is rank-deficient in finite precision. This rank depends\non the dimension of the ambient space and also on the type of interaction\nbetween the hyper-cubes containing the corresponding set of particles. This\nrank structure can be leveraged to reduce the computational cost of certain\nmatrix operations such as matrix-vector products, solving linear systems, etc.\nWe also present numerical results on the growth of rank of certain sub-matrices\nin $1$D, $2$D, $3$D and $4$D, which, not surprisingly, agrees with the\ntheoretical results.",

To this end, we propose a consistent PnP solver, named \\emph{CPnP},\nwith bias elimination. Specifically, linear equations are constructed from the\noriginal projection model via measurement model modification and variable\nelimination, based on which a closed-form least-squares solution is obtained.\nWe then analyze and subtract the asymptotic bias of this solution, resulting in\na consistent estimate. Additionally, Gauss-Newton (GN) iterations are executed\nto refine the consistent solution. Our proposed estimator is efficient in terms\nof computations -- it has $O(n)$ computational complexity.

We present a full framework for\nautomated APIs testing, from the schema extraction to test case generation. In\naddition, we consider two kinds of testing: white-box and black-box testing.\nThe white-box testing is performed when the source code of the GraphQL API is\navailable. Our approach is based on evolutionary search. Test cases are evolved\nto intelligently explore the solution space while maximizing code coverage and\nfault-finding criteria. The black-box testing does not require access to the\nsource code of the GraphQL API. It is therefore of more general applicability,\nalbeit it has worse performance. In this context, we use a random search to\ngenerate GraphQL data. The proposed framework is implemented and integrated\ninto the open-source EvoMaster tool. With enabled white-box heuristics, i.e.,\nwhite-box mode, experiments on 7 open-source GraphQL APIs show statistically\nsignificant improvement of the evolutionary approach compared to the baseline\nrandom search.

The first system\nincluded an iPhone 11 camera with 3024X4032 resolution which acquired images\nfrom an industrial pond in indoor conditions. Two experiments were performed\nwith this system, the first one included 200 images acquired in one day on\ngrowth stages 9,10 with an iPhone 11 camera on specific illumination condition.\nIn the second experiment, a larvae industrial pond was photographed for 11 days\nwith two devices an iPhone 11 and a SONY DSCHX90V cameras. With the first\ndevice (iPhone 11) two illumination conditions were tested. In each condition,\n110 images were acquired. That system resulted in an accuracy of 88.4 percent\nimage detection. The second system included a DSLR Nikon D510 camera with a\n2000X2000 resolution with which seven experiments were performed outside the\nindustrial pond. Images were acquired on day 1 of larvae growing stage\nresulting in the acquisition of a total of 700 images. That system resulted in\nan accuracy of 86 percent for a density of 50. An algorithm that automatically\ncounts the number of larvae was developed for both cases based on the YOLOv5\nCNN model. In addition, in this study, a larvae growth function was developed.\nDaily, several larvae were taken manually from the industrial pond and analyzed\nunder a microscope. Once the growth stage was determined, images of the larva\nwere acquired. Each larva's length was measured manually from the images.

Accordingly, the\nlearned prototypes preserve the semantic class relations in the embedding space\nand we can predict the label of an image by assigning its feature to the\nnearest hyperbolic class prototype. We use an in-house skin lesion dataset\nwhich consists of around 230k dermoscopic images on 65 skin diseases to verify\nour method.

However, a massive amount of face data is usually\ncompressed before being analyzed due to limitations on transmission or storage.\nThe compressed images may lose the powerful identity information, resulting in\nthe performance degradation of the FR system. Herein, we make the first attempt\nto study just noticeable difference (JND) for the FR system, which can be\ndefined as the maximum distortion that the FR system cannot notice. More\nspecifically, we establish a JND dataset including 3530 original images and\n137,670 compressed images generated by advanced reference encoding/decoding\nsoftware based on the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard (VTM-15.0).\nSubsequently, we develop a novel JND prediction model to directly infer JND\nimages for the FR system. In particular, in order to maximum redundancy removal\nwithout impairment of robust identity information, we apply the encoder with\nmultiple feature extraction and attention-based feature decomposition modules\nto progressively decompose face features into two uncorrelated components,\ni.e., identity and residual features, via self-supervised learning. Then, the\nresidual feature is fed into the decoder to generate the residual map. Finally,\nthe predicted JND map is obtained by subtracting the residual map from the\noriginal image. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed model\nachieves higher accuracy of JND map prediction compared with the\nstate-of-the-art JND models, and is capable of saving more bits while\nmaintaining the performance of the FR system compared with VTM-15.0.",

    "abstract": "Matching user search queries with relevant keywords bid by advertisers in\nreal-time is a crucial problem in sponsored search. In the literature, two\nbroad set of approaches have been explored to solve this problem: (i) Dense\nRetrieval (DR) - learning dense vector representations for queries and bid\nkeywords in a shared space, and (ii) Natural Language Generation (NLG) -\nlearning to directly generate bid keywords given queries. In this work, we\nfirst conduct an empirical study of these two approaches and show that they\noffer complementary benefits that are additive. In particular, a large fraction\nof the keywords retrieved from NLG haven't been retrieved by DR and vice-versa.\nWe then show that it is possible to effectively combine the advantages of these\ntwo approaches in one model. Specifically, we propose HEARTS: a novel\nmulti-task fusion framework where we jointly optimize a shared encoder to\nperform both DR and non-autoregressive NLG. Through extensive experiments on\nsearch queries from over 30+ countries spanning 20+ languages, we show that\nHEARTS retrieves 40.3% more high-quality bid keywords than the baseline\napproaches with the same GPU compute. We also demonstrate that inferring on a\nsingle HEARTS model is as good as inferring on two different DR and NLG\nbaseline models, with 2x the compute. Further, we show that DR models trained\nwith the HEARTS objective are significantly better than those trained with the\nstandard contrastive loss functions. Finally, we show that our HEARTS objective\ncan be adopted to short-text retrieval tasks other than sponsored search and\nachieve significant performance gains.",

In this survey, we first summarize the\ncommon types and typical cases of smart contract vulnerabilities from three\nlevels, i.e., Solidity code layer, EVM execution layer, and Block dependency\nlayer. Further, we review the research progress of smart contract vulnerability\ndetection and classify existing counterparts into five categories, i.e., formal\nverification, symbolic execution, fuzzing detection, intermediate\nrepresentation, and deep learning. Empirically, we take 300 real-world smart\ncontracts deployed on Ethereum as the test samples and compare the\nrepresentative methods in terms of accuracy, F1-Score, and average detection\ntime. Finally, we discuss the challenges in the field of smart contract\nvulnerability detection and combine with the deep learning technology to look\nforward to future research directions.",

    "abstract": "The vision of 5G lies in providing high data rates, low latency (for the aim\nof near-real-time applications), significantly increased base station capacity,\nand near-perfect quality of service (QoS) for users, compared to LTE networks.\nIn order to provide such services, 5G systems will support various combinations\nof access technologies such as LTE, NR, NR-U and Wi-Fi. Each radio access\ntechnology (RAT) provides different types of access, and these should be\nallocated and managed optimally among the users. Besides resource management,\n5G systems will also support a dual connectivity service. The orchestration of\nthe network therefore becomes a more difficult problem for system managers with\nrespect to legacy access technologies. In this paper, we propose an algorithm\nfor RAT allocation based on federated meta-learning (FML), which enables RAN\nintelligent controllers (RICs) to adapt more quickly to dynamically changing\nenvironments. We have designed a simulation environment which contains LTE and\n5G NR service technologies. In the simulation, our objective is to fulfil UE\ndemands within the deadline of transmission to provide higher QoS values. We\ncompared our proposed algorithm with a single RL agent, the Reptile algorithm\nand a rule-based heuristic method. Simulation results show that the proposed\nFML method achieves higher caching rates at first deployment round 21% and 12%\nrespectively.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a transfer learning approach to recalibrate our\npreviously developed Wheel Odometry Neural Network (WhONet) for vehicle\npositioning in environments where Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)\nare unavailable. The WhONet has been shown to possess the capability to learn\nthe uncertainties in the wheel speed measurements needed for correction and\naccurate positioning of vehicles. These uncertainties may be manifested as tyre\npressure changes from driving on muddy and uneven terrains or wheel slips.\nHowever, a common cause for concern for data-driven approaches, such as the\nWhONet model, is usually the inability to generalise the models to a new\nvehicle. In scenarios where machine learning models are trained in a specific\ndomain but deployed in another domain, the model's performance degrades. In\nreal-life scenarios, several factors are influential to this degradation, from\nchanges to the dynamics of the vehicle to new pattern distributions of the\nsensor's noise, and bias will make the test sensor data vary from training\ndata. Therefore, the challenge is to explore techniques that allow the trained\nmachine learning models to spontaneously adjust to new vehicle domains. As\nsuch, we propose the Recalibrated-Wheel Odometry neural Network (R-WhONet),\nthat adapts the WhONet model from its source domain (a vehicle and environment\non which the model is initially trained) to the target domain (a new vehicle on\nwhich the trained model is to be deployed). Through a performance evaluation on\nseveral GNSS outage scenarios - short-term complex driving scenarios, and on\nlonger-term GNSS outage scenarios. We demonstrate that a model trained in the\nsource domain does not generalise well to a new vehicle in the target domain.\nHowever, we show that our new proposed framework improves the generalisation of\nthe WhONet model to new vehicles in the target domains by up to 32%.",

In this paper we propose a novel counting logic,\n$\\mathcal{L}_{C}$, to describe the temporal properties of client-server systems\nwith an unbounded number of clients. We also propose two dimensional bounded\nmodel checking ($2D$-BMC) strategy that uses two distinguishable parameters,\none for execution steps and another for the number of tokens in the net\nrepresenting a client-server system, and these two evolve separately, which is\ndifferent from the standard BMC techniques in the Petri Nets formalism. This\n$2D$-BMC strategy is implemented in a tool called DCModelChecker which\nleverages the $2D$-BMC technique with a state-of-the-art satisfiability modulo\ntheories (SMT) solver Z3. The system is given as a Petri Net and properties\nspecified using $\\mathcal{L}_{C}$ are encoded into formulas that are checked by\nthe solver.

This problem is\napplicable to a broad variety of domains, including E-commerce networks,\ndatabase systems, and program analysis. In reality, users are frequently most\nconcerned with the hop-constrained cycles (i.e., cycles with a limited number\nof hops). For instance, in the E-commerce networks, the fraud detection team\nwould discard cycles with a high number of hops since they are less relevant\nand grow exponentially in size. Thus, it is quite reasonable to investigate the\nfeedback vertex set problem in the context of hop-constrained cycles, namely\nhop-constrained cycle cover problem. It is concerned with determining a set of\nvertices that covers all hop-constrained cycles in a given directed graph. A\ncommon method to solve this is to use a bottom-up algorithm, where it\niteratively selects cover vertices into the result set. Based on this paradigm,\nthe existing works mainly focus on the vertices orders and several heuristic\nstrategies.

    "abstract": "Logging of incoming/outgoing vehicles serves as a piece of critical\ninformation for root-cause analysis to combat security breach incidents in\nvarious sensitive organizations. RFID tagging hampers the scalability of\nvehicle tracking solutions on both logistics as well as technical fronts. For\ninstance, requiring each incoming vehicle(departmental or private) to be RFID\ntagged is a severe constraint and coupling video analytics with RFID to detect\nabnormal vehicle movement is non-trivial. We leverage publicly available\nimplementations of computer vision algorithms to develop an interpretable\nvehicle tracking algorithm using finite-state machine formalism. The\nstate-machine consumes input from the cascaded object detection and optical\ncharacter recognition(OCR) models for state transitions. We evaluated the\nproposed method on 75 video clips of 285 vehicles from our system deployment\nsite. We observed that the detection rate is most affected by the speed and the\ntype of vehicle. The highest detection rate is achieved when the vehicle\nmovement is restricted to follow a movement restrictions(SOP) at the checkpoint\nsimilar to RFID tagging. We further analyzed 700 vehicle tracking predictions\non live-data and identified that the majority of vehicle number prediction\nerrors are due to illegible-text, image-blur, text occlusion and out-of-vocab\nletters in vehicle numbers. Towards system deployment and performance\nenhancement, we expect our ongoing system monitoring to provide evidences to\nestablish a higher vehicle-throughput SOP at the security checkpoint as well as\nto drive the fine-tuning of the deployed computer-vision models and the\nstate-machine to establish the proposed approach as a promising alternative to\nRFID-tagging.",

    "abstract": "Efficiency and robustness are increasingly needed for applications on 3D\npoint clouds, with the ubiquitous use of edge devices in scenarios like\nautonomous driving and robotics, which often demand real-time and reliable\nresponses. The paper tackles the challenge by designing a general framework to\nconstruct 3D learning architectures with SO(3) equivariance and network\nbinarization. However, a naive combination of equivariant networks and\nbinarization either causes sub-optimal computational efficiency or geometric\nambiguity.

Precisely, the presence of scalar features makes the major\npart of the network binarizable, while vector features serve to retain rich\nstructural information and ensure SO(3) equivariance.

    "abstract": "Industry assignment, which assigns firms to industries according to a\npredefined Industry Classification System (ICS), is fundamental to a large\nnumber of critical business practices, ranging from operations and strategic\ndecision making by firms to economic analyses by government agencies. Three\ntypes of expert knowledge are essential to effective industry assignment:\ndefinition-based knowledge (i.e., expert definitions of each industry),\nstructure-based knowledge (i.e., structural relationships among industries as\nspecified in an ICS), and assignment-based knowledge (i.e., prior firm-industry\nassignments performed by domain experts). Existing industry assignment methods\nutilize only assignment-based knowledge to learn a model that classifies\nunassigned firms to industries, and overlook definition-based and\nstructure-based knowledge. Moreover, these methods only consider which industry\na firm has been assigned to, but ignore the time-specificity of\nassignment-based knowledge, i.e., when the assignment occurs. To address the\nlimitations of existing methods, we propose a novel deep learning-based method\nthat not only seamlessly integrates the three types of knowledge for industry\nassignment but also takes the time-specificity of assignment-based knowledge\ninto account. Methodologically, our method features two innovations: dynamic\nindustry representation and hierarchical assignment. The former represents an\nindustry as a sequence of time-specific vectors by integrating the three types\nof knowledge through our proposed temporal and spatial aggregation mechanisms.\nThe latter takes industry and firm representations as inputs, computes the\nprobability of assigning a firm to different industries, and assigns the firm\nto the industry with the highest probability.",

    "abstract": "Advancing object detection to open-vocabulary and few-shot transfer has long\nbeen a challenge for computer vision research. This work explores a continual\nlearning approach that enables a detector to expand its zero/few-shot\ncapabilities via multi-dataset vision-language pre-training. Using natural\nlanguage as knowledge representation, we explore methods to accumulate \"visual\nvocabulary\" from different training datasets and unify the task as a\nlanguage-conditioned detection framework. Specifically, we propose a novel\nlanguage-aware detector OmDet and a novel training mechanism. The proposed\nmultimodal detection network can resolve the technical challenges in\nmulti-dataset joint training and it can generalize to arbitrary number of\ntraining datasets without the requirements for manual label taxonomy merging.\nExperiment results on COCO, Pascal VOC, and Wider Face/Pedestrian confirmed the\nefficacy by achieving on par or higher scores in joint training compared to\ntraining separately. Moreover, we pre-train on more than 20 million images with\n4 million unique object vocabulary, and the resulting model is evaluated on 35\ndownstream tasks of ODinW. Results show that OmDet is able to achieve the\nstate-of-the-art fine-tuned performance on ODinW. And analysis shows that by\nscaling up the proposed pre-training method, OmDet continues to improve its\nzero/few-shot tuning performance, suggesting a promising way for further\nscaling.",

    "abstract": "Background/Context. The use of automated driving systems (ADSs) in the real\nworld requires rigorous testing to ensure safety. To increase trust, ADSs\nshould be tested on a large set of diverse road scenarios. Literature suggests\nthat if a vehicle is driven along a set of geometrically diverse roads-measured\nusing various diversity measures (DMs)-it will react in a wide range of\nbehaviours, thereby increasing the chances of observing failures (if any), or\nstrengthening the confidence in its safety, if no failures are observed. To the\nbest of our knowledge, however, this assumption has never been tested before,\nnor have road DMs been assessed for their properties. Objective/Aim. Our goal\nis to perform an exploratory study on 47 currently used and new, potentially\npromising road DMs. Specifically, our research questions look into the road DMs\nthemselves, to analyse their properties (e.g. monotonicity, computation\nefficiency), and to test correlation between DMs. Furthermore, we look at the\nuse of road DMs to investigate whether the assumption that diverse test suites\nof roads expose diverse driving behaviour holds. Method. Our empirical analysis\nrelies on a state-of-the-art, open-source ADSs testing infrastructure and uses\na data set containing over 97,000 individual road geometries and matching\nsimulation data that were collected using two driving agents. By sampling\nrandom test suites of various sizes and measuring their roads' geometric\ndiversity, we study road DMs properties, the correlation between road DMs, and\nthe correlation between road DMs and the observed behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Currently, large pre-trained models are widely applied in neural code\ncompletion systems, such as Github Copilot, aiXcoder, and TabNine. Though large\nmodels significantly outperform their smaller counterparts, a survey with 2,631\nparticipants reveals that around 70\\% displayed code completions from Copilot\nare not accepted by developers. Being reviewed but not accepted, these\ncompletions bring a threat to productivity. Besides, considering the high cost\nof the large models, it is a huge waste of computing resources and energy,\nwhich severely goes against the sustainable development principle of AI\ntechnologies. Additionally, in code completion systems, the completion requests\nare automatically and actively issued to the models as developers type out,\nwhich significantly aggravates the workload. However, to the best of our\nknowledge, such waste has never been realized, not to mention effectively\naddressed, in the context of neural code completion. Hence, preventing such\nprofitless code completions from happening in a cost-friendly way is of urgent\nneed. To fill this gap, we first investigate the prompts of these completions\nand find four observable prompt patterns, which demonstrate the feasibility of\nidentifying such prompts based on prompts themselves. Motivated by this\nfinding, we propose an early-rejection mechanism to turn down low-return\nprompts by foretelling the completion qualities without sending them to the\nLCM. Further, we propose a lightweight Transformer-based estimator to\ndemonstrate the feasibility of the mechanism. The experimental results show\nthat the estimator rejects low-return prompts with a promising accuracy of\n83.2%.",

    "abstract": "Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the world. Diagnosing cancer\nearly on can save many lives. Pathologists have to look at tissue microarray\n(TMA) images manually to identify tumors, which can be time-consuming,\ninconsistent and subjective. Existing algorithms that automatically detect\ntumors have either not achieved the accuracy level of a pathologist or require\nsubstantial human involvements. A major challenge is that TMA images with\ndifferent shapes, sizes, and locations can have the same score. Learning\nstaining patterns in TMA images requires a huge number of images, which are\nseverely limited due to privacy concerns and regulations in medical\norganizations. TMA images from different cancer types may have common\ncharacteristics that could provide valuable information, but using them\ndirectly harms the accuracy. Transfer learning is adopted to increase the\ntraining sample size by extracting knowledge from tissue images from different\ncancer types. Transfer learning has made it possible for the algorithm to break\nthe critical accuracy barrier. The proposed algorithm reports an accuracy of\n75.9% on breast cancer TMA images from the Stanford Tissue Microarray Database,\nachieving the 75% accuracy level of pathologists. This will allow pathologists\nto confidently use automatic algorithms to assist them in recognizing tumors\nconsistently with a higher accuracy in real time.",

These\nattacks can disadvantage a particular subgroup of nodes in GNN-based node\nclassification, where nodes of the underlying network have sensitive\nattributes, such as race or gender. We conduct qualitative and experimental\nanalyses explaining how adversarial link injection impairs the fairness of GNN\npredictions. For example, an attacker can compromise the fairness of GNN-based\nnode classification by injecting adversarial links between nodes belonging to\nopposite subgroups and opposite class labels. Our experiments on empirical\ndatasets demonstrate that adversarial fairness attacks can significantly\ndegrade the fairness of GNN predictions (attacks are effective) with a low\nperturbation rate (attacks are efficient) and without a significant drop in\naccuracy (attacks are deceptive). This work demonstrates the vulnerability of\nGNN models to adversarial fairness attacks.

Due to the distinct network\ntopology, specifically tailored solutions are required. Firstly, the relative\nmovement of the constellation causes frequent handover events between the\nsatellites and the terminals on ground. Furthermore, unevenly distributed\ntraffic demands lead to geographical hot spots. The physical size of the\nnetwork also implies significant propagation delays. Therefore, monitoring the\ndynamic topology changes and link loads on a network-wide basis for routing\npurposes is typically impractical with massive signaling overhead. To address\nthese issues, we propose a distributed load-balanced routing scheme based on\nSoftware Defined Networking.

In the wake of other digital experiences, today's online job market\nhas candidates expecting to see the right opportunities based on their skill\nset. Similarly, enterprises increasingly need to use data to guarantee that the\nskills within their workforce remain future-proof. However, structured\ninformation about skills is often missing, and processes building on self- or\nmanager-assessment have shown to struggle with issues around adoption,\ncompleteness, and freshness of the resulting data. Extracting skills is a\nhighly challenging task, given the many thousands of possible skill labels\nmentioned either explicitly or merely described implicitly and the lack of\nfinely annotated training corpora. Previous work on skill extraction overly\nsimplifies the task to an explicit entity detection task or builds on manually\nannotated training data that would be infeasible if applied to a complete\nvocabulary of skills. We propose an end-to-end system for skill extraction,\nbased on distant supervision through literal matching. We propose and evaluate\nseveral negative sampling strategies, tuned on a small validation dataset, to\nimprove the generalization of skill extraction towards implicitly mentioned\nskills, despite the lack of such implicit skills in the distantly supervised\ndata. We observe that using the ESCO taxonomy to select negative examples from\nrelated skills yields the biggest improvements, and combining three different\nstrategies in one model further increases the performance, up to 8 percentage\npoints in RP@5.

It is necessary for operators to solve the congestion in\nadvance and effectively to guarantee the quality of user experience. Cell-level\nmulti-indicator forecasting is the foundation task for proactive complex\nnetwork optimization. In this paper, we propose the 4G/5G Cell-level\nmulti-indicator forecasting method based on the dense-Multi-Layer Perceptron\n(MLP) neural network, which adds additional fully-connected layers between\nnon-adjacent layers in an MLP network. The model forecasted the following\nweek's traffic indicators of 13000 cells according to the six-month historical\nindicators of 65000 cells in the 4G&5G network, which got the highest weighted\nMAPE score (0.2484) in the China Mobile problem statement in the ITU-T AI/ML in\n5G Challenge 2021. Furthermore, the proposed model has been integrated into the\nAsiaInfo 4G/5G energy-saving system and deployed in Jiangsu Province of China.",

    "abstract": "Microarchitectural code analyzers, i.e., tools that estimate the throughput\nof machine code basic blocks, are important utensils in the tool belt of\nperformance engineers. Recent tools like llvm-mca, uiCA, and Ithemal use a\nvariety of techniques and different models for their throughput predictions.\nWhen put to the test, it is common to see these state-of-the-art tools give\nvery different results. These inconsistencies are either errors, or they point\nto different and rarely documented assumptions made by the tool designers.\nIn this paper, we present AnICA, a tool taking inspiration from differential\ntesting and abstract interpretation to systematically analyze inconsistencies\namong these code analyzers. Our evaluation shows that AnICA can summarize\nthousands of inconsistencies in a few dozen descriptions that directly lead to\nhigh-level insights into the different behavior of the tools.

    "abstract": "Estimating accurate lane lines in 3D space remains challenging due to their\nsparse and slim nature. In this work, we propose the M^2-3DLaneNet, a\nMulti-Modal framework for effective 3D lane detection. Aiming at integrating\ncomplementary information from multi-sensors, M^2-3DLaneNet first extracts\nmulti-modal features with modal-specific backbones, then fuses them in a\nunified Bird's-Eye View (BEV) space. Specifically, our method consists of two\ncore components. 1) To achieve accurate 2D-3D mapping, we propose the top-down\nBEV generation. Within it, a Line-Restricted Deform-Attention (LRDA) module is\nutilized to effectively enhance image features in a top-down manner, fully\ncapturing the slenderness features of lanes. After that, it casts the 2D\npyramidal features into 3D space using depth-aware lifting and generates BEV\nfeatures through pillarization. 2) We further propose the bottom-up BEV fusion,\nwhich aggregates multi-modal features through multi-scale cascaded attention,\nintegrating complementary information from camera and LiDAR sensors. Sufficient\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of M^2-3DLaneNet, which outperforms\nprevious state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, i.e., 12.1% F1-score\nimprovement on OpenLane dataset.",

    "abstract": "A novel semantics-empowered two-user uplink non-orthogonal multiple access\n(NOMA) framework is proposed for resource efficiency enhancement. More\nparticularly, a secondary far user (F-user) employs the semantic communication\n(SemCom) while a primary near user (N-user) employs the conventional bit-based\ncommunication (BitCom). The fundamental performance limit, namely\nsemantic-versus-bit (SvB) rate region, of the proposed semantics-empowered NOMA\nframework is characterized. The equivalent SvB rate region achieved by the\nconventional BitCom-based NOMA is provided as the baseline scheme. It unveils\nthat, compared to BitCom, SemCom can significantly improve the F-user's\nperformance when its permitted transmit power is strictly capped, but may\nperform worse when its permitted transmit power is high. Guided by this result,\nthe proposed semantics-empowered NOMA framework is investigated over fading\nchannels. An opportunistic SemCom and BitCom scheme is proposed, which enables\nthe secondary F-user to participate in NOMA via the most suitable communication\nmethod at each fading state, thus striking a good tradeoff between its own\nachieved performance and the interference imposed to the primary N-user. Two\nscenarios are considered for employing the opportunistic scheme, namely on-off\nresource management and continuous resource management. For each scenario, the\noptimal communication policy over fading channels is derived for maximizing the\nergodic semantic rate achieved at the secondary F-user, subject to the minimum\nergodic bit rate constraint of the primary N-user. Numerical results show that\nthe proposed opportunistic scheme in both scenarios can achieve higher\ncommunication performance for NOMA than the baseline schemes merely employing\nSemCom or BitCom.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning, especially deep neural networks (DNNs), has been widely and\nsuccessfully adopted in many critical applications for its high effectiveness\nand efficiency. The rapid development of DNNs has benefited from the existence\nof some high-quality datasets ($e.g.$, ImageNet), which allow researchers and\ndevelopers to easily verify the performance of their methods. Currently, almost\nall existing released datasets require that they can only be adopted for\nacademic or educational purposes rather than commercial purposes without\npermission. However, there is still no good way to ensure that. In this paper,\nwe formulate the protection of released datasets as verifying whether they are\nadopted for training a (suspicious) third-party model, where defenders can only\nquery the model while having no information about its parameters and training\ndetails. Based on this formulation, we propose to embed external patterns via\nbackdoor watermarking for the ownership verification to protect them. Our\nmethod contains two main parts, including dataset watermarking and dataset\nverification. Specifically, we exploit poison-only backdoor attacks ($e.g.$,\nBadNets) for dataset watermarking and design a hypothesis-test-guided method\nfor dataset verification. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets of\ndifferent tasks are conducted, which verify the effectiveness of our method.\nThe code for reproducing main experiments is available at\n\\url{https://github.com/THUYimingLi/DVBW}.",

Multi-Instance\nGPU (MIG) is a new technology introduced by NVIDIA that can partition a GPU to\nbetter fit workloads that don't require all the memory and compute resources of\na full GPU. In this paper, we examine the performance of a MIG-enabled A100 GPU\nunder deep learning workloads of three sizes focusing on image recognition\ntraining with ResNet models.

In contrast, for medium and\nlarge-sized workloads, which already utilize the whole GPU well on their own,\nMIG only provides marginal performance improvements.

However, this may not be feasible when (i) the robot cannot\nincrease the gripping force -- the max gripping force is already applied or\n(ii) increased force damages the grasped object, such as soft fruit. Moreover,\nthe robot fixes the gripping force when it forms a stable grasp on the surface\nof an object, and changing the gripping force during real-time manipulation may\nnot be an effective control policy. We propose a novel control approach to slip\navoidance including a learned action-conditioned slip predictor and a\nconstrained optimiser avoiding a predicted slip given a desired robot action.\nWe show the effectiveness of the proposed trajectory adaptation method with\nreceding horizon controller with a series of real-robot test cases.

DMSSRM can restore images by adaptively\nassigning weights to features from different scales according to the blur\ndistribution and content information of the input images. DMTNet combines the\nadvantages of transformer and CNN, in which the vision transformer improves the\nperformance ceiling of CNN, and the inductive bias of CNN enables transformer\nto extract more robust features without relying on a large amount of data.\nDMTNet might be the first attempt to use vision transformer to restore the\nblurring images to clarity.

There exist PLMs trained over European and US legal text, most\nnotably LegalBERT. However, with the rapidly increasing volume of NLP\napplications on Indian legal documents, and the distinguishing characteristics\nof Indian legal text, it has become necessary to pre-train LMs over Indian\nlegal text as well. In this work, we introduce transformer-based PLMs\npre-trained over a large corpus of Indian legal documents. We also apply these\nPLMs over several benchmark legal NLP tasks over Indian legal documents,\nnamely, Legal Statute Identification from facts, Semantic segmentation of court\njudgements, and Court Judgement Prediction. Our experiments demonstrate the\nutility of the India-specific PLMs developed in this work.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous mobile robots, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), have\nreceived significant attention for their applications in construction. These\nplatforms have great potential to automate and enhance the quality and\nfrequency of the required data for many tasks such as construction schedule\nupdating, inspections, and monitoring. Robust localization is a critical\nenabler for reliable deployments of autonomous robotic platforms. Automated\nrobotic solutions rely mainly on the global positioning system (GPS) for\noutdoor localization. However, GPS signals are denied indoors, and pre-built\nenvironment maps are often used for indoor localization. This entails\ngenerating high-quality maps by teleoperating the mobile robot in the\nenvironment. Not only is this approach time-consuming and tedious, but it also\nis unreliable in indoor construction settings. Layout changes with construction\nprogress, requiring frequent mapping sessions to support autonomous missions.\nMoreover, the effectiveness of vision-based solutions relying on visual\nfeatures is highly impacted in low texture and repetitive areas on site. To\naddress these challenges, we previously proposed a low-cost, lightweight\ntag-based visual-inertial localization method using AprilTags. Tags, in this\nmethod, are paper printable landmarks with known sizes and locations,\nrepresenting the environment's quasi-map. Since tag placement/replacement is a\nmanual process, it is subject to human errors. In this work, we study the\nimpact of human error in the manual tag installation process and propose a\nstochastic approach to account for this uncertainty using the Lie group theory.\nEmploying Monte Carlo simulation, we experimentally show that the proposed\nstochastic model incorporated in our on-manifold formulation improves the\nrobustness and accuracy of tag-based localization against inevitable\nimperfections in manual tag installation on site.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning techniques have been applied widely in industrial\nrecommendation systems. However, far less attention has been paid to the\noverfitting problem of models in recommendation systems, which, on the\ncontrary, is recognized as a critical issue for deep neural networks. In the\ncontext of Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, we observe an interesting\none-epoch overfitting problem: the model performance exhibits a dramatic\ndegradation at the beginning of the second epoch. Such a phenomenon has been\nwitnessed widely in real-world applications of CTR models. Thereby, the best\nperformance is usually achieved by training with only one epoch. To understand\nthe underlying factors behind the one-epoch phenomenon, we conduct extensive\nexperiments on the production data set collected from the display advertising\nsystem of Alibaba. The results show that the model structure, the optimization\nalgorithm with a fast convergence rate, and the feature sparsity are closely\nrelated to the one-epoch phenomenon. We also provide a likely hypothesis for\nexplaining such a phenomenon and conduct a set of proof-of-concept experiments.\nWe hope this work can shed light on future research on training more epochs for\nbetter performance.",

    "abstract": "Real-time music accompaniment generation has a wide range of applications in\nthe music industry, such as music education and live performances. However,\nautomatic real-time music accompaniment generation is still understudied and\noften faces a trade-off between logical latency and exposure bias. In this\npaper, we propose SongDriver, a real-time music accompaniment generation system\nwithout logical latency nor exposure bias. Specifically, SongDriver divides one\naccompaniment generation task into two phases: 1) The arrangement phase, where\na Transformer model first arranges chords for input melodies in real-time, and\ncaches the chords for the next phase instead of playing them out. 2) The\nprediction phase, where a CRF model generates playable multi-track\naccompaniments for the coming melodies based on previously cached chords. With\nthis two-phase strategy, SongDriver directly generates the accompaniment for\nthe upcoming melody, achieving zero logical latency. Furthermore, when\npredicting chords for a timestep, SongDriver refers to the cached chords from\nthe first phase rather than its previous predictions, which avoids the exposure\nbias problem. Since the input length is often constrained under real-time\nconditions, another potential problem is the loss of long-term sequential\ninformation. To make up for this disadvantage, we extract four musical features\nfrom a long-term music piece before the current time step as global\ninformation. In the experiment, we train SongDriver on some open-source\ndatasets and an original \\`aiSong Dataset built from Chinese-style modern pop\nmusic scores. The results show that SongDriver outperforms existing SOTA\n(state-of-the-art) models on both objective and subjective metrics, meanwhile\nsignificantly reducing the physical latency.",

In addition to the classifier, new techniques have also been\nidentified to capture RESIPs without interacting with and relaying traffic\nthrough RESIP services, which can significantly lower the cost and thus allow a\ncontinuous monitoring of RESIPs. Our RESIP service classifier has achieved a\ngood performance with a recall of 99.7% and a precision of 97.6% in 10-fold\ncross validation. Applying the classifier has identified 399 RESIP services, a\nmuch larger set compared to 38 RESIP services collected in all previous works.\nOur effort of RESIP capturing lead to a collection of 9,077,278 RESIP IPs\n(51.36% are located in China), 96.70% of which are not covered in publicly\navailable RESIP datasets. An extensive measurement on RESIPs and their services\nhas uncovered a set of interesting findings as well as several security\nimplications. Especially, 80.05% RESIP IPs located in China have sourced at\nleast one malicious traffic flows during 2021, resulting in 52-million\nmalicious traffic flows in total.

Also, 3,232,698 China RESIP\nIPs have opened at least one TCP/UDP ports for accepting relaying requests,\nwhich incurs non-negligible security risks to the local network of RESIPs.\nBesides, 91% China RESIP IPs are of a lifetime less than 10 days while most\nChina RESIP services show up a crest-trough pattern in terms of the daily\nactive RESIPs across time.",

Constructing random walks in a graph, i.e., sequences of\nvertices selected with a specific probability distribution, is a prominent task\nin many of these graph applications as well as machine learning (ML) on\ngraph-structured data. In a streaming scenario, random walks need to constantly\nkeep up with the graph updates to avoid stale walks and thus, performance\ndegradation in the downstream tasks. We present Wharf, a system that\nefficiently stores and updates random walks on streaming graphs. It avoids a\npotential size explosion by maintaining a compressed, high-throughput, and\nlow-latency data structure. It achieves (i) the succinct representation by\ncoupling compressed purely functional binary trees and pairing functions for\nstoring the walks, and (ii) efficient walk updates by effectively pruning the\nwalk search space. We evaluate Wharf, with real and synthetic graphs, in terms\nof throughput and latency when updating random walks.

    "abstract": "The advent of nanoscale memristors raised hopes of being able to build CMOL\n(CMOS/nanowire/moLecular) type ultra-dense in-memory-computing circuit\narchitectures. In CMOL, nanoscale memristors would be fabricated at the\nintersection of nanowires. The CMOL concept can be exploited in neuromorphic\nhardware by fabricating lower-density neurons on CMOS and placing massive\nanalog synaptic connectivity with nanowire and nanoscale-memristor fabric\npost-fabricated on top. However, technical problems have hindered such\ndevelopments for presently available reliable commercial monolithic\nCMOS-memristor technologies. On one hand, each memristor needs a MOS selector\ntransistor in series to guarantee forming and programming operations in large\narrays. This results in compound MOS-memristor synapses (called 1T1R) which are\nno longer synapses at the crossing of nanowires. On the other hand, memristors\ndo not yet constitute highly reliable, stable analog memories for massive\nanalog-weight synapses with gradual learning. Here we demonstrate a pseudo-CMOL\nmonolithic chip core that circumvents the two technical problems mentioned\nabove by (a) exploiting a CMOL-like geometrical chip layout technique to\nimprove density despite the 1T1R limitation, and (b) exploiting a binary weight\nstochastic Spike-Timing-Dependent-Plasticity (STDP) learning rule that takes\nadvantage of the more reliable binary memory capability of the memristors used.\nExperimental results are provided for a spiking neural network (SNN) CMOL-core\nwith 64 input neurons, 64 output neurons, and 4096 1T1R synapses, fabricated in\n130nm CMOS with 200nm-sized Ti/HfOx/TiN memristors on top.

In such cases, the\nsolution would require a bimanual robot in order to visually unveil the stem\nand manipulate the grasped crop to create cutting affordances which is similar\nto the practice used by humans. In this work, a dual-arm coordinated motion\ncontrol methodology for reaching a stem pre-cut state is proposed. The camera\nequipped arm with the cutter is reaching the stem, unveiling it as much as\npossible, while the second arm is moving the grasped crop towards the\nsurrounding free-space to facilitate its stem cutting.

    "abstract": "We study the impact of different loss functions on lesion segmentation from\nmedical images. Although the Cross-Entropy (CE) loss is the most popular option\nwhen dealing with natural images, for biomedical image segmentation the soft\nDice loss is often preferred due to its ability to handle imbalanced scenarios.\nOn the other hand, the combination of both functions has also been successfully\napplied in this kind of tasks. A much less studied problem is the\ngeneralization ability of all these losses in the presence of\nOut-of-Distribution (OoD) data. This refers to samples appearing in test time\nthat are drawn from a different distribution than training images. In our case,\nwe train our models on images that always contain lesions, but in test time we\nalso have lesion-free samples. We analyze the impact of the minimization of\ndifferent loss functions on in-distribution performance, but also its ability\nto generalize to OoD data, via comprehensive experiments on polyp segmentation\nfrom endoscopic images and ulcer segmentation from diabetic feet images. Our\nfindings are surprising: CE-Dice loss combinations that excel in segmenting\nin-distribution images have a poor performance when dealing with OoD data,\nwhich leads us to recommend the adoption of the CE loss for this kind of\nproblems, due to its robustness and ability to generalize to OoD samples.

A worker agent learns to\nsolve sub-routing tasks by minimizing the cost in terms of both tour length and\nrejection rate for each vehicle, the maximum of which is then fed back to the\nmanager agent to learn better assignments. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat the proposed framework outperforms strong baselines in terms of higher\nsolution quality and shorter computation time. More importantly, the trained\nagents also achieve competitive performance for solving unseen larger\ninstances.",

Attention is typically multi-headed, where each head has an\nindependent set of learned parameters and operates on the same input feature\nsequence. The output of multi-headed attention is a fusion of the outputs from\nthe individual heads. We empirically analyze the diversity between\nrepresentations produced by the different attention heads and demonstrate that\nthe heads become highly correlated during the course of training. We\ninvestigate a few approaches to increasing attention head diversity, including\nusing different attention mechanisms for each head and auxiliary training loss\nfunctions to promote head diversity. We show that introducing\ndiversity-promoting auxiliary loss functions during training is a more\neffective approach, and obtain WER improvements of up to 6% relative on the\nLibrispeech corpus. Finally, we draw a connection between the diversity of\nattention heads and the similarity of the gradients of head parameters.",

    "abstract": "Continual learning aims to rapidly and continually learn the current task\nfrom a sequence of tasks.\nCompared to other kinds of methods, the methods based on experience replay\nhave shown great advantages to overcome catastrophic forgetting. One common\nlimitation of this method is the data imbalance between the previous and\ncurrent tasks, which would further aggravate forgetting. Moreover, how to\neffectively address the stability-plasticity dilemma in this setting is also an\nurgent problem to be solved. In this paper, we overcome these challenges by\nproposing a novel framework called Meta-learning update via Multi-scale\nKnowledge Distillation and Data Augmentation (MMKDDA). Specifically, we apply\nmultiscale knowledge distillation to grasp the evolution of long-range and\nshort-range spatial relationships at different feature levels to alleviate the\nproblem of data imbalance. Besides, our method mixes the samples from the\nepisodic memory and current task in the online continual training procedure,\nthus alleviating the side influence due to the change of probability\ndistribution. Moreover, we optimize our model via the meta-learning update\nresorting to the number of tasks seen previously, which is helpful to keep a\nbetter balance between stability and plasticity. Finally, our experimental\nevaluation on four benchmark datasets shows the effectiveness of the proposed\nMMKDDA framework against other popular baselines, and ablation studies are also\nconducted to further analyze the role of each component in our framework.",

    "abstract": "Despite great success in many applications, deep neural networks are not\nalways robust in practice. For instance, a convolutional neuron network (CNN)\nmodel for classification tasks often performs unsatisfactorily in classifying\nsome particular classes of objects. In this work, we are concerned with\npatching the weak part of a CNN model instead of improving it through the\ncostly retraining of the entire model. Inspired by the fundamental concepts of\nmodularization and composition in software engineering, we propose a compressed\nmodularization approach, CNNSplitter, which decomposes a strong CNN model for\n$N$-class classification into $N$ smaller CNN modules. Each module is a\nsub-model containing a part of the convolution kernels of the strong model. To\npatch a weak CNN model that performs unsatisfactorily on a target class (TC),\nwe compose the weak CNN model with the corresponding module obtained from a\nstrong CNN model. The ability of the weak CNN model to recognize the TC can\nthus be improved through patching. Moreover, the ability to recognize non-TCs\nis also improved, as the samples misclassified as TC could be classified as\nnon-TCs correctly. Experimental results with two representative CNNs on three\nwidely-used datasets show that the averaged improvement on the TC in terms of\nprecision and recall are 12.54% and 2.14%, respectively. Moreover, patching\nimproves the accuracy of non-TCs by 1.18%. The results demonstrate that\nCNNSplitter can patch a weak CNN model through modularization and composition,\nthus providing a new solution for developing robust CNN models.",

The\ndistinct needs that these stakeholder groups may have, and the different\naspects of fairness that therefore should be considered, make for a challenging\nresearch field with ample opportunities for improvement. The review first\noutlines current literature on MRS fairness from the perspective of each\nstakeholder and the stakeholders combined, and then identifies promising\ndirections for future research.\nThe two open questions arising from the review are as follows: (i) In the MRS\nfield, only limited data is publicly available to conduct fairness research;\nmost datasets either originate from the same source or are proprietary (and,\nthus, not widely accessible). How can we address this limited data\navailability? (ii) Overall, the review shows that the large majority of works\nanalyze the current situation of MRS fairness, whereas only few works propose\napproaches to improve it.

    "title": "Hierarchical Conversational Preference Elicitation with Bandit Feedback",
    "abstract": "The recent advances of conversational recommendations provide a promising way\nto efficiently elicit users' preferences via conversational interactions. To\nachieve this, the recommender system conducts conversations with users, asking\ntheir preferences for different items or item categories. Most existing\nconversational recommender systems for cold-start users utilize a multi-armed\nbandit framework to learn users' preference in an online manner. However, they\nrely on a pre-defined conversation frequency for asking about item categories\ninstead of individual items, which may incur excessive conversational\ninteractions that hurt user experience. To enable more flexible questioning\nabout key-terms, we formulate a new conversational bandit problem that allows\nthe recommender system to choose either a key-term or an item to recommend at\neach round and explicitly models the rewards of these actions. This motivates\nus to handle a new exploration-exploitation (EE) trade-off between key-term\nasking and item recommendation, which requires us to accurately model the\nrelationship between key-term and item rewards. We conduct a survey and analyze\na real-world dataset to find that, unlike assumptions made in prior works,\nkey-term rewards are mainly affected by rewards of representative items.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a new approach to design verified compositions of Neural\nNetwork (NN) controllers for autonomous systems with tasks captured by Linear\nTemporal Logic (LTL) formulas. Particularly, the LTL formula requires the\nsystem to reach and avoid certain regions in a temporal/logical order. We\nassume that the system is equipped with a finite set of trained NN controllers.\nEach controller has been trained so that it can drive the system towards a\nspecific region of interest while avoiding others. Our goal is to check if\nthere exists a temporal composition of the trained NN controllers - and if so,\nto compute it - that will yield composite system behaviors that satisfy a\nuser-specified LTL task for any initial system state belonging to a given set.\nTo address this problem, we propose a new approach that relies on a novel\nintegration of automata theory and recently proposed reachability analysis\ntools for NN-controlled systems. We note that the proposed method can be\napplied to other controllers, not necessarily modeled by NNs, by appropriate\nselection of the reachability analysis tool. We focus on NN controllers due to\ntheir lack of robustness. The proposed method is demonstrated on navigation\ntasks for aerial vehicles.",

In this paper we show that, in such cases,\ndetection of mention boundaries does not bring any considerable performance\ngain in extracting entities, and therefore can be skipped. To conduct our\nanalysis, we propose an \"Entity Tagging\" formulation of the problem, where\nmodels are evaluated purely on the set of extracted entities without\nconsidering mentions.

Wide-area consensus is\nchallenging due to two main reasons: (1) low throughput due to the high latency\noverhead of client request dissemination and (2) network asynchrony that causes\nconsensus protocols to lose liveness. In this paper, we propose Mandator and\nSporades, a modular state machine replication algorithm that enables high\nperformance and resiliency in the wide-area setting.\nTo address the high client request dissemination overhead challenge, we\npropose Mandator, a novel consensus-agnostic asynchronous dissemination layer.\nMandator separates client request dissemination from the critical path of\nconsensus to obtain high performance. Composing Mandator with Multi-Paxos\n(Mandator-Paxos) delivers significantly high throughput under synchronous\nnetworks. However, under asynchronous network conditions, Mandator-Paxos loses\nliveness which results in high latency. To achieve low latency and robustness\nunder asynchrony, we propose Sporades, a novel omission fault-tolerant\nconsensus algorithm. Sporades consists of two modes of operations --\nsynchronous and asynchronous -- that always ensure liveness. The combination of\nMandator and Sporades (Mandator-Sporades) provides a robust and high-performing\nstate machine replication system.\nWe implement and evaluate Mandator-Sporades in a wide-area deployment running\non Amazon EC2.

    "abstract": "Meta-gradient methods (Xu et al., 2018; Zahavy et al., 2020) offer a\npromising solution to the problem of hyperparameter selection and adaptation in\nnon-stationary reinforcement learning problems. However, the properties of\nmeta-gradients in such environments have not been systematically studied. In\nthis work, we bring new clarity to meta-gradients in non-stationary\nenvironments. Concretely, we ask: (i) how much information should be given to\nthe learned optimizers, so as to enable faster adaptation and generalization\nover a lifetime, (ii) what meta-optimizer functions are learned in this\nprocess, and (iii) whether meta-gradient methods provide a bigger advantage in\nhighly non-stationary environments. To study the effect of information provided\nto the meta-optimizer, as in recent works (Flennerhag et al., 2021; Almeida et\nal., 2021), we replace the tuned meta-parameters of fixed update rules with\nlearned meta-parameter functions of selected context features. The context\nfeatures carry information about agent performance and changes in the\nenvironment and hence can inform learned meta-parameter schedules. We find that\nadding more contextual information is generally beneficial, leading to faster\nadaptation of meta-parameter values and increased performance over a lifetime.\nWe support these results with a qualitative analysis of resulting\nmeta-parameter schedules and learned functions of context features. Lastly, we\nfind that without context, meta-gradients do not provide a consistent advantage\nover the baseline in highly non-stationary environments. Our findings suggest\nthat contextualizing meta-gradients can play a pivotal role in extracting high\nperformance from meta-gradients in non-stationary settings.",

In forward\nuncertainty quantification, one is interested in analyzing the stochastic\nresponse of the PDE subject to input uncertainty, which usually involves\nsolving high-dimensional integrals of the PDE output over a sequence of\nstochastic variables. In practical computations, one typically needs to\ndiscretize the problem in several ways: approximating an infinite-dimensional\ninput random field with a finite-dimensional random field, spatial\ndiscretization of the PDE using, e.g., finite elements, and approximating\nhigh-dimensional integrals using cubatures such as quasi-Monte Carlo methods.\nIn this paper, we focus on the error resulting from dimension truncation of an\ninput random field.

While homophily is natural\nfor many real-world networks, there are also networks without this property. It\nis often believed that standard message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs) do\nnot perform well on non-homophilous graphs, and thus such datasets need special\nattention. While a lot of effort has been put into developing graph\nrepresentation learning methods for heterophilous graphs, there is no\nuniversally agreed upon measure of homophily. Several metrics for measuring\nhomophily have been used in the literature, however, we show that all of them\nhave critical drawbacks preventing comparison of homophily levels between\ndifferent datasets. We formalize desirable properties for a proper homophily\nmeasure and show how existing literature on the properties of classification\nperformance metrics can be linked to our problem. In doing so we find a measure\nthat we call adjusted homophily that satisfies more desirable properties than\nexisting homophily measures. Interestingly, this measure is related to two\nclassification performance metrics - Cohen's Kappa and Matthews correlation\ncoefficient. Then, we go beyond the homophily-heterophily dichotomy and propose\na new property that we call label informativeness (LI) that characterizes how\nmuch information a neighbor's label provides about a node's label. We\ntheoretically show that LI is comparable across datasets with different numbers\nof classes and class size balance. Through a series of experiments we show that\nLI is a better predictor of the performance of GNNs on a dataset than\nhomophily.

    "abstract": "Recently, deep learning methods have been successfully applied to solve\nnumerous challenges in the field of digital pathology. However, many of these\napproaches are fully supervised and require annotated images. Annotating a\nhistology image is a time-consuming and tedious process for even a highly\nskilled pathologist, and, as such, most histology datasets lack\nregion-of-interest annotations and are weakly labeled. In this paper, we\nintroduce HistoPerm, a view generation approach designed for improving the\nperformance of representation learning techniques on histology images in weakly\nsupervised settings. In HistoPerm, we permute augmented views of patches\ngenerated from whole-slide histology images to improve classification accuracy.\nThese permuted views belong to the same original slide-level class but are\nproduced from distinct patch instances. We tested adding HistoPerm to BYOL and\nSimCLR, two prominent representation learning methods, on two public histology\ndatasets for Celiac disease and Renal Cell Carcinoma. For both datasets, we\nfound improved performance in terms of accuracy, F1-score, and AUC compared to\nthe standard BYOL and SimCLR approaches. Particularly, in a linear evaluation\nconfiguration, HistoPerm increases classification accuracy on the Celiac\ndisease dataset by 8% for BYOL and 3% for SimCLR. Similarly, with HistoPerm,\nclassification accuracy increases by 2% for BYOL and 0.25% for SimCLR on the\nRenal Cell Carcinoma dataset. The proposed permutation-based view generation\napproach can be adopted in common representation learning frameworks to capture\nhistopathology features in weakly supervised settings and can lead to\nwhole-slide classification outcomes that are close to, or even better than,\nfully supervised methods.",

We also develop a model\nStoryGANc based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for story\ncontinuation, and compare it with the StoryDALL-E model to demonstrate the\nadvantages of our approach. We show that our retro-fitting approach outperforms\nGAN-based models for story continuation and facilitates copying of visual\nelements from the source image, thereby improving continuity in the generated\nvisual story. Finally, our analysis suggests that pretrained transformers\nstruggle to comprehend narratives containing several characters. Overall, our\nwork demonstrates that pretrained text-to-image synthesis models can be adapted\nfor complex and low-resource tasks like story continuation.",

    "abstract": "Existing machine learning methods for causal inference usually estimate\nquantities expressed via the mean of potential outcomes (e.g., average\ntreatment effect). However, such quantities do not capture the full information\nabout the distribution of potential outcomes. In this work, we estimate the\ndensity of potential outcomes after interventions from observational data.\nSpecifically, we propose a novel, fully-parametric deep learning method for\nthis purpose, called Interventional Normalizing Flows. Our Interventional\nNormalizing Flows offer a properly normalized density estimator. For this, we\nintroduce an iterative training of two normalizing flows, namely (i) a teacher\nflow for estimation of nuisance parameters and (ii) a student flow for\nparametric estimation of the density of potential outcomes. For efficient and\ndoubly-robust estimation of the student flow parameters, we develop a custom\ntractable optimization objective based on a one-step bias correction. Across\nvarious experiments, we demonstrate that our Interventional Normalizing Flows\nare expressive and highly effective, and scale well with both sample size and\nhigh-dimensional confounding. To the best of our knowledge, our Interventional\nNormalizing Flows are the first fully-parametric, deep learning method for\ndensity estimation of potential outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Quantum annealing is a type of analog computation that aims to use quantum\nmechanical fluctuations in search of optimal solutions of QUBO (quadratic\nunconstrained binary optimization) or, equivalently, Ising problems. Since\nNP-hard problems can in general be mapped to Ising and QUBO formulations, the\nquantum annealing paradigm has the potential to help solve various NP-hard\nproblems. Current quantum annealers, such as those manufactured by D-Wave\nSystems, Inc., have various practical limitations including the size (number of\nqubits) of the problem that can be solved, the qubit connectivity, and error\ndue to the environment or system calibration, which can reduce the quality of\nthe solutions. Typically, for an arbitrary problem instance, the corresponding\nQUBO (or Ising) structure will not natively embed onto the available qubit\narchitecture on the quantum chip. Thus, in these cases, a minor embedding of\nthe problem structure onto the device is necessary. However, minor embeddings\non these devices do not always make use of the full sparse chip hardware graph,\nand a large portion of the available qubits stay unused during quantum\nannealing. In this work, we embed a disjoint random QUBO on the unused parts of\nthe chip alongside the QUBO to be solved, which acts as an indicator of the\nsolution quality of the device over time. Using experiments on three different\nD-Wave quantum annealers, we demonstrate that (i) long term trends in solution\nquality exist on the D-Wave device, and (ii) the unused qubits can be used to\nmeasure the current level of noise of the quantum system.",

Standard TBP is based on transmission focused at a fixed focal\ndepth: this results in well-known drawbacks like non-uniform beam width over\ndepth, presence of significant side lobes and quick energy drop out after the\nfocal depth. To overcome these limitations, in this work we present a novel\noptimization approach for TBP by focusing the analysis on the narrow band\napproximation of the TBP and considering transmit delays as free variables\ninstead of linked to a specific focal depth. We formulate the problem as a non\nlinear Least Squares problem to minimize the difference between the TBP\ncorresponding to a set of delays and the desired one, modeled as a 2D\nrectangular shape elongated in the direction of the beam axis.

    "abstract": "Cross-dataset emotion recognition as an extremely challenging task in the\nfield of EEG-based affective computing is influenced by many factors, which\nmake the universal models yield unsatisfactory results. Facing the situation\nthat lack of EEG information decoding researches, we first analyzed the impact\nof different EEG information(individual, session, emotion, trial) to emotion\nrecognition by sample space visualization, sample aggregation phenomenon\nquantification, and energy pattern analysis on five public datasets. And based\non these phenomena and patterns, we provided the processing methods and\ninterpretable work of various EEG differences. Through the analysis of\nemotional feature distribution patterns, Individual Emotional Feature\nDistribution Difference(IEFDD) was found. After analyzing the limitations of\ntraditional modeling approach suffering from IEFDD, we proposed the\nWeight-based Channel-model Matrix Framework(WCMF). In order to characterize\nemotional feature distribution patterns reasonably, four weight extraction\nmethods were designed, and the optimal of them is Correction T-test(CT) weight\nextraction method. Finally, the performance of WCMF was validated on\ncross-dataset tasks in two kinds of experiments that simulated different\npractical scenarios, the results showed WCMF had more stable and better emotion\nrecognition ability.",

    "abstract": "A central challenge in training one-shot learning models is the limited\nrepresentativeness of the available shots of the data space. Particularly in\nthe field of network neuroscience where the brain is represented as a graph,\nsuch models may lead to low performance when classifying brain states (e.g.,\ntypical vs. autistic). To cope with this, most of the existing works involve a\ndata augmentation step to increase the size of the training set, its diversity\nand representativeness. Though effective, such augmentation methods are limited\nto generating samples with the same size as the input shots (e.g., generating\nbrain connectivity matrices from a single shot matrix). To the best of our\nknowledge, the problem of generating brain multigraphs capturing multiple types\nof connectivity between pairs of nodes (i.e., anatomical regions) from a single\nbrain graph remains unsolved. In this paper, we unprecedentedly propose a\nhybrid graph neural network (GNN) architecture, namely Multigraph Generator\nNetwork or briefly MultigraphGNet, comprising two subnetworks: (1) a\nmany-to-one GNN which integrates an input population of brain multigraphs into\na single template graph, namely a connectional brain temple (CBT), and (2) a\nreverse one-to-many U-Net network which takes the learned CBT in each training\nstep and outputs the reconstructed input multigraph population. Both networks\nare trained in an end-to-end way using a cyclic loss. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our MultigraphGNet boosts the performance of an independent\nclassifier when trained on the augmented brain multigraphs in comparison with\ntraining on a single CBT from each class. We hope that our framework can shed\nsome light on the future research of multigraph augmentation from a single\ngraph.

Proper model calibration is\nvital for high-risk applications. Unfortunately, modern deep neural networks\nare poorly calibrated, compromising trustworthiness and reliability. Medical\nimage segmentation particularly suffers from this due to the natural\nuncertainty of tissue boundaries. This is exasperated by their loss functions,\nwhich favor overconfidence in the majority classes. We address these challenges\nwith DOMINO, a domain-aware model calibration method that leverages the\nsemantic confusability and hierarchical similarity between class labels. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that our DOMINO-calibrated deep neural networks\noutperform non-calibrated models and state-of-the-art morphometric methods in\nhead image segmentation. Our results show that our method can consistently\nachieve better calibration, higher accuracy, and faster inference times than\nthese methods, especially on rarer classes. This performance is attributed to\nour domain-aware regularization to inform semantic model calibration. These\nfindings show the importance of semantic ties between class labels in building\nconfidence in deep learning models.

TamGent outperforms previous baselines in\nterms of both effectiveness and efficiency. The method is further verified by\ngenerating candidate compounds for the SARS-CoV-2 main protease and the\noncogenic mutant KRAS G12C.

Another way is to supply the prior image as the input with the\nPET image included in the refinement steps, which can fit for scenarios of\ndifferent noise levels. 120 18F-FDG datasets and 140 18F-MK-6240 datasets were\nutilized to evaluate the proposed DDPM-based methods. Quantification show that\nthe DDPM-based frameworks with PET information included can generate better\nresults than the nonlocal mean and Unet-based denoising methods. Adding\nadditional MR prior in the model can help achieve better performance and\nfurther reduce the uncertainty during image denoising. Solely relying on MR\nprior while ignoring the PET information can result in large bias. Regional and\nsurface quantification shows that employing MR prior as the network input while\nembedding PET image as a data-consistency constraint during inference can\nachieve the best performance. In summary, DDPM-based PET image denoising is a\nflexible framework, which can efficiently utilize prior information and achieve\nbetter performance than the nonlocal mean and Unet-based denoising methods.",

    "title": "Proving a directed analogue of the Gy\u00e1rf\u00e1s-Sumner conjecture for  orientations of $P_4$",
    "abstract": "An oriented graph is a digraph that does not contain a directed cycle of\nlength two. An (oriented) graph $D$ is $H$-free if $D$ does not contain $H$ as\nan induced sub(di)graph. The Gy\\'arf\\'as-Sumner conjecture is a widely-open\nconjecture on simple graphs, which states that for any forest $F$, there is\nsome function $f$ such that every $F$-free graph $G$ with clique number\n$\\omega(G)$ has chromatic number at most $f(\\omega(G))$. Aboulker, Charbit, and\nNaserasr [Extension of Gy\\'arf\\'as-Sumner Conjecture to Digraphs; E-JC 2021]\nproposed an analogue of this conjecture to the dichromatic number of oriented\ngraphs. The dichromatic number of a digraph $D$ is the minimum number of colors\nrequired to color the vertex set of $D$ so that no directed cycle in $D$ is\nmonochromatic.\nAboulker, Charbit, and Naserasr's $\\overrightarrow{\\chi}$-boundedness\nconjecture states that for every oriented forest $F$, there is some function\n$f$ such that every $F$-free oriented graph $D$ has dichromatic number at most\n$f(\\omega(D))$, where $\\omega(D)$ is the size of a maximum clique in the graph\nunderlying $D$. In this paper, we perform the first step towards proving\nAboulker, Charbit, and Naserasr's $\\overrightarrow{\\chi}$-boundedness\nconjecture by showing that it holds when $F$ is any orientation of a path on\nfour vertices.",

    "title": "Tractable hierarchies of convex relaxations for polynomial optimization  on the nonnegative orthant",
    "abstract": "We consider polynomial optimization problems (POP) on a semialgebraic set\ncontained in the nonnegative orthant (every POP on a compact set can be put in\nthis format by a simple translation of the origin). Such a POP can be converted\nto an equivalent POP by squaring each variable. Using even symmetry and the\nconcept of factor width, we propose a hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations\nbased on the extension of P\\'olya's Positivstellensatz by Dickinson-Povh. As\nits distinguishing and crucial feature, the maximal matrix size of each\nresulting semidefinite relaxation can be chosen arbitrarily and in addition, we\nprove that the sequence of values returned by the new hierarchy converges to\nthe optimal value of the original POP at the rate $O(\\varepsilon^{-c})$ if the\nsemialgebraic set has nonempty interior. When applied to (i) robustness\ncertification of multi-layer neural networks and (ii) computation of positive\nmaximal singular values, our method based on P\\'olya's Positivstellensatz\nprovides better bounds and runs several hundred times faster than the standard\nMoment-SOS hierarchy.",
