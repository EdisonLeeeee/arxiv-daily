    "abstract": "The Science Gateways Community Institute (SGCI) is an NSF Software\nInfrastructure for Sustained Innovation (S2I2) funded project that leads and\nsupports the science gateway community. Major activities for SGCI include a)\nsustainability training, including the Focus Week week-long course designed to\nhelp science gateway operators develop sustainability plans, and the Jumpstart\nvirtual short-course; b) usability and user experience consulting; c) a\ncommunity catalog of science gateways and science gateway software; d)\nworkforce development activities, including a coding institute for students,\ninternship opportunities, and hackathons; e) an annual conference; and f)\nin-depth technical support for client gateway projects. The goals of SGCI's\nEmbedded Technical Support component are to help the institute's clients to\ncreate new science gateways or to significantly enhance existing science\ngateways. Examples of the latter include helping to implement major new\ncapabilities and to implement significant usability improvements suggested by\nSGCI's usability consultants. The Embedded Technical Support component was\nmanaged by Indiana University and involved research software engineers at San\nDiego Supercomputer Center, Texas Advanced Computing Center, Indiana\nUniversity, and Purdue University (through 2019). Since 2016, the component has\ninvolved 20 research software engineers as consultants and has conducted 59\nclient consultations.

    "abstract": "This work demonstrates the use of the Digital Twin methodology to predict the\nwater concentration and temperature of chicken meat. It marks a milestone on\nthe path to autonomous cooking devices that do not only control device\ntemperatures but culinary food quality markers as well. A custom water\ntransport equation is coupled to the energy equation. The transport equations\nare implemented in ANSYS Fluent 2019R2 via User Defined Function (UDF) code\nwritten in C. The model is in good agreement with experiments provided by\nproject partners. Thermal fluid-structure interaction simulations of pan-frying\nare performed to obtain realistic heat transfer coefficients. They indicate\nthat the coupling of food transport equations to the surrounding heat transfer\nmechanisms, such as radiation and natural convection, seems promising for\nfuture research. Co-simulation of the process is not feasible during operation\nin the field, so reduced-order models (ROM) are introduced. An evaluation of\nROM toolkits on the ANSYS platform reveals that linear time-invariant (LTI)\nmodels are unsuitable for cooking applications. In contrast, the recently\nlaunched Dynamic ROM Builder predicts the core temperatures with significantly\nlow errors (factor ten below the model and discretization errors of the\nfull-order model). Two examples demonstrate the usage of a Digital Twin\ncontrolling the core temperature of chicken fillets. The PI closed-loop control\nsystem remains insensitive to errors induced by the Dynamic ROM evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have demonstrated promise in solving\nforward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations. Despite\nrecent progress on expanding the class of problems that can be tackled by\nPINNs, most of existing use-cases involve simple geometric domains. To date,\nthere is no clear way to inform PINNs about the topology of the domain where\nthe problem is being solved. In this work, we propose a novel positional\nencoding mechanism for PINNs based on the eigenfunctions of the\nLaplace-Beltrami operator. This technique allows to create an input space for\nthe neural network that represents the geometry of a given object. We\napproximate the eigenfunctions as well as the operators involved in the partial\ndifferential equations with finite elements. We extensively test and compare\nthe proposed methodology against traditional PINNs in complex shapes, such as a\ncoil, a heat sink and a bunny, with different physics, such as the Eikonal\nequation and heat transfer. We also study the sensitivity of our method to the\nnumber of eigenfunctions used, as well as the discretization used for the\neigenfunctions and the underlying operators. Our results show excellent\nagreement with the ground truth data in cases where traditional PINNs fail to\nproduce a meaningful solution. We envision this new technique will expand the\neffectiveness of PINNs to more realistic applications.",

    "abstract": "Recent works have shown that tackling offline reinforcement learning (RL)\nwith a conditional policy produces promising results by converting the RL task\nto a supervised learning task. Decision Transformer (DT) combines the\nconditional policy approach and Transformer architecture to show competitive\nperformance against several benchmarks. However, DT lacks stitching ability --\none of the critical abilities for offline RL that learns the optimal policy\nfrom sub-optimal trajectories. The issue becomes significant when the offline\ndataset only contains sub-optimal trajectories. On the other hand, the\nconventional RL approaches based on Dynamic Programming (such as Q-learning) do\nnot suffer the same issue; however, they suffer from unstable learning\nbehaviours, especially when it employs function approximation in an off-policy\nlearning setting. In this paper, we propose Q-learning Decision Transformer\n(QDT) that addresses the shortcomings of DT by leveraging the benefit of\nDynamic Programming (Q-learning). QDT utilises the Dynamic Programming\n(Q-learning) results to relabel the return-to-go in the training data. We then\ntrain the DT with the relabelled data. Our approach efficiently exploits the\nbenefits of these two approaches and compensates for each other's shortcomings\nto achieve better performance. We demonstrate the issue of DT and the advantage\nof QDT in a simple environment. We also evaluate QDT in the more complex D4RL\nbenchmark showing good performance gains.",

    "abstract": "Teleoperation has emerged as an alternative solution to fully-autonomous\nsystems for achieving human-level capabilities on humanoids. Specifically,\nteleoperation with whole-body control is a promising hands-free strategy to\ncommand humanoids but demands more physical and mental effort. To mitigate this\nlimitation, researchers have proposed shared-control methods incorporating\nrobot decision-making to aid humans on low-level tasks, further reducing\noperation effort. However, shared-control methods for wheeled humanoid\ntelelocomotion on a whole-body level has yet to be explored. In this work, we\nstudy how whole-body feedback affects the performance of different\nshared-control methods for obstacle avoidance in diverse environments. A\nTime-Derivative Sigmoid Function (TDSF) is proposed to generate more intuitive\nforce feedback from obstacles. Comprehensive human experiments were conducted,\nand the results concluded that force feedback enhances the whole-body\ntelelocomotion performance in unfamiliar environments but could reduce\nperformance in familiar environments. Conveying the robot's intention through\nhaptics showed further improvements since the operator can utilize the force\nfeedback for short-distance planning and visual feedback for long-distance\nplanning.",

In this\nwork we show that, by carefully combining the two types of queries, a binary\nclassifier can be learned in time $\\operatorname{poly}(n+m)$ using only $O(m^2\n\\log n)$ label queries and $O\\big(m \\log \\frac{m}{\\gamma}\\big)$ seed queries;\nthe result extends to $k$-class classifiers at the price of a $k!k^2$\nmultiplicative overhead.

    "abstract": "In recent years, recommendation and ranking systems have become increasingly\npopular on digital platforms. However, previous work has highlighted how\npersonalized systems might lead to unintentional harms for users. Practitioners\nrequire metrics to measure and mitigate these types of harms in production\nsystems. To meet this need, many fairness definitions have been introduced and\nexplored by the RecSys community. Unfortunately, this has led to a\nproliferation of possible fairness metrics from which practitioners can choose.\nThe increase in volume and complexity of metrics creates a need for\npractitioners to deeply understand the nuances of fairness definitions and\nimplementations. Additionally, practitioners need to understand the ethical\nguidelines that accompany these metrics for responsible implementation. Recent\nwork has shown that there is a proliferation of ethics guidelines and has\npointed to the need for more implementation guidance rather than principles\nalone. The wide variety of available metrics, coupled with the lack of accepted\nstandards or shared knowledge in practice leads to a challenging environment\nfor practitioners to navigate. In this position paper, we focus on this\nwidening gap between the research community and practitioners concerning the\navailability of metrics versus the ability to put them into practice. We\naddress this gap with our current work, which focuses on developing methods to\nhelp ML practitioners in their decision-making processes when picking fairness\nmetrics for recommendation and ranking systems. In our iterative design\ninterviews, we have already found that practitioners need both practical and\nreflective guidance when refining fairness constraints. This is especially\nsalient given the growing challenge for practitioners to leverage the correct\nmetrics while balancing complex fairness contexts.",

    "abstract": "In explainable machine learning, local post-hoc explanation algorithms and\ninherently interpretable models are often seen as competing approaches. In this\nwork, offer a novel perspective on Shapley Values, a prominent post-hoc\nexplanation technique, and show that it is strongly connected with\nGlassbox-GAMs, a popular class of interpretable models. We introduce\n$n$-Shapley Values, a natural extension of Shapley Values that explain\nindividual predictions with interaction terms up to order $n$. As $n$\nincreases, the $n$-Shapley Values converge towards the Shapley-GAM, a uniquely\ndetermined decomposition of the original function. From the Shapley-GAM, we can\ncompute Shapley Values of arbitrary order, which gives precise insights into\nthe limitations of these explanations. We then show that Shapley Values recover\ngeneralized additive models of order $n$, assuming that we allow for\ninteraction terms up to order $n$ in the explanations. This implies that the\noriginal Shapley Values recover Glassbox-GAMs. At the technical end, we show\nthat there is a one-to-one correspondence between different ways to choose the\nvalue function and different functional decompositions of the original\nfunction. This provides a novel perspective on the question of how to choose\nthe value function. We also present an empirical analysis of the degree of\nvariable interaction that is present in various standard classifiers, and\ndiscuss the implications of our results for algorithmic explanations.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in machine learning have enabled its wide application in\ndifferent domains, and one of the most exciting applications is autonomous\nvehicles (AVs), which have encouraged the development of a number of ML\nalgorithms from perception to prediction to planning. However, training AVs\nusually requires a large amount of training data collected from different\ndriving environments (e.g., cities) as well as different types of personal\ninformation (e.g., working hours and routes). Such collected large data,\ntreated as the new oil for ML in the data-centric AI era, usually contains a\nlarge amount of privacy-sensitive information which is hard to remove or even\naudit. Although existing privacy protection approaches have achieved certain\ntheoretical and empirical success, there is still a gap when applying them to\nreal-world applications such as autonomous vehicles. For instance, when\ntraining AVs, not only can individually identifiable information reveal\nprivacy-sensitive information, but also population-level information such as\nroad construction within a city, and proprietary-level commercial secrets of\nAVs. Thus, it is critical to revisit the frontier of privacy risks and\ncorresponding protection approaches in AVs to bridge this gap. Following this\ngoal, in this work, we provide a new taxonomy for privacy risks and protection\nmethods in AVs, and we categorize privacy in AVs into three levels: individual,\npopulation, and proprietary. We explicitly list out recent challenges to\nprotect each of these levels of privacy, summarize existing solutions to these\nchallenges, discuss the lessons and conclusions, and provide potential future\ndirections and opportunities for both researchers and practitioners.

We\nspecifically consider stateful performance issues, where a sequence of initial\ninput messages drives an SDN controller into a state such that its performance\ndegrades pathologically when processing subsequent messages. We identify key\nchallenges in applying canonical program analysis techniques: large input space\nof messages (e.g., stateful OpenFlow protocol), complex code base and software\narchitecture (e.g., OSGi framework with dynamic launch), and the semantic\ndependencies between the internal state and external inputs. We design SPIDER,\na practical fuzzing workflow that tackles these challenges and automatically\nuncovers such issues in SDN controllers. SPIDER's design entails a careful\nsynthesis and extension of semantic fuzzing, performance fuzzing, and static\nanalysis, taken together with domain-specific insights to tackle these\nchallenges. We show that our design workflow is robust across two controllers\n-- ONOS and OpenDaylight -- with very different internal implementations. Using\nSPIDER, we were able to identify and confirm multiple stateful performance\nissues.",

    "abstract": "Cost-effective depth and infrared sensors as alternatives to usual RGB\nsensors are now a reality, and have some advantages over RGB in domains like\nautonomous navigation and remote sensing. As such, building computer vision and\ndeep learning systems for depth and infrared data are crucial. However, large\nlabeled datasets for these modalities are still lacking. In such cases,\ntransferring knowledge from a neural network trained on a well-labeled large\ndataset in the source modality (RGB) to a neural network that works on a target\nmodality (depth, infrared, etc.) is of great value. For reasons like memory and\nprivacy, it may not be possible to access the source data, and knowledge\ntransfer needs to work with only the source models. We describe an effective\nsolution, SOCKET: SOurce-free Cross-modal KnowledgE Transfer for this\nchallenging task of transferring knowledge from one source modality to a\ndifferent target modality without access to task-relevant source data. The\nframework reduces the modality gap using paired task-irrelevant data, as well\nas by matching the mean and variance of the target features with the batch-norm\nstatistics that are present in the source models. We show through extensive\nexperiments that our method significantly outperforms existing source-free\nmethods for classification tasks which do not account for the modality gap.",

Various adversaries are\nabusing an increasing range of platforms, e.g., enterprise platforms, mobile\nphones, PCs, transportation systems, and industrial control systems. In recent\nyears, we have witnessed various cyber attacks on transportation systems,\nincluding attacks on ports, airports, and trains. It is only a matter of time\nbefore transportation systems become a more common target of cyber attackers.\nDue to the enormous potential damage inherent in attacking vehicles carrying\nmany passengers and the lack of security measures applied in traditional\nairborne systems, the vulnerability of aircraft systems is one of the most\nconcerning topics in the vehicle security domain. This paper provides a\ncomprehensive review of aircraft systems and components and their various\nnetworks, emphasizing the cyber threats they are exposed to and the impact of a\ncyber attack on these components and networks and the essential capabilities of\nthe aircraft. In addition, we present a comprehensive and in-depth taxonomy\nthat standardizes the knowledge and understanding of cyber security in the\navionics field from an adversary's perspective. The taxonomy divides techniques\ninto relevant categories (tactics) reflecting the various phases of the\nadversarial attack lifecycle and maps existing attacks according to the MITRE\nATT&CK methodology. Furthermore, we analyze the security risks among the\nvarious systems according to the potential threat actors and categorize the\nthreats based on STRIDE threat model.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) provides an efficient paradigm to jointly train a\nglobal model leveraging data from distributed users. As the local training data\ncome from different users who may not be trustworthy, several studies have\nshown that FL is vulnerable to poisoning attacks. Meanwhile, to protect the\nprivacy of local users, FL is always trained in a differentially private way\n(DPFL). Thus, in this paper, we ask: Can we leverage the innate privacy\nproperty of DPFL to provide certified robustness against poisoning attacks? Can\nwe further improve the privacy of FL to improve such certification? We first\ninvestigate both user-level and instance-level privacy of FL and propose novel\nmechanisms to achieve improved instance-level privacy. We then provide two\nrobustness certification criteria: certified prediction and certified attack\ncost for DPFL on both levels. Theoretically, we prove the certified robustness\nof DPFL under a bounded number of adversarial users or instances. Empirically,\nwe conduct extensive experiments to verify our theories under a range of\nattacks on different datasets. We show that DPFL with a tighter privacy\nguarantee always provides stronger robustness certification in terms of\ncertified attack cost, but the optimal certified prediction is achieved under a\nproper balance between privacy protection and utility loss.",

They\nprovided a strategyproof mechanism that achieves an $n$-approximation and they\nmade the bold conjecture that this is the best approximation achievable by any\ndeterministic strategyproof scheduling mechanism. After more than two decades\nand several efforts, $n$ remains the best known approximation and very recent\nwork by \\citet{CKK21} has been able to prove an $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$\napproximation lower bound for all deterministic strategyproof mechanisms. This\nstrong negative result, however, heavily depends on the fact that the\nperformance of these mechanisms is evaluated using worst-case analysis. To\novercome such overly pessimistic, and often uninformative, worst-case bounds, a\nsurge of recent work has focused on the ``learning-augmented framework'', whose\ngoal is to leverage machine-learned predictions to obtain improved\napproximations when these predictions are accurate (consistency), while also\nachieving near-optimal worst-case approximations even when the predictions are\narbitrarily wrong (robustness).\nIn this work, we study the classic strategic scheduling problem\nof~\\citet{NR99} using the learning-augmented framework and give a deterministic\npolynomial-time strategyproof mechanism that is $6$-consistent and $2n$-robust.\nWe thus achieve the ``best of both worlds'': an $O(1)$ consistency and an\n$O(n)$ robustness that asymptotically matches the best-known approximation. We\nthen extend this result to provide more general worst-case approximation\nguarantees as a function of the prediction error. Finally, we complement our\npositive results by showing that any $1$-consistent deterministic strategyproof\nmechanism has unbounded robustness.",

The standard\napproach to constructing neural radiance fields takes advantage of multi-view\nconsistency and requires many calibrated views of a scene, a requirement that\ncannot be satisfied when learning on large-scale image data in the wild. We\ntake a step towards addressing this shortcoming by introducing a model that\nencodes the input image into a disentangled object representation that contains\na code for object shape, a code for object appearance, and an estimated camera\npose from which the object image is captured. Our model conditions a NeRF on\nthe predicted object representation and uses volume rendering to generate\nimages from novel views. We train the model end-to-end on a large collection of\ninput images. As the model is only provided with single-view images, the\nproblem is highly under-constrained. Therefore, in addition to using a\nreconstruction loss on the synthesized input view, we use an auxiliary\nadversarial loss on the novel rendered views. Furthermore, we leverage object\nsymmetry and cycle camera pose consistency. We conduct extensive quantitative\nand qualitative experiments on the ShapeNet dataset as well as qualitative\nexperiments on Open Images dataset.

In particular, our goal is to enable the synthesis\nof a series of actions, which we refer to as temporal action composition. The\ncurrent state of the art in text-conditioned motion synthesis only takes a\nsingle action or a single sentence as input. This is partially due to lack of\nsuitable training data containing action sequences, but also due to the\ncomputational complexity of their non-autoregressive model formulation, which\ndoes not scale well to long sequences. In this work, we address both issues.\nFirst, we exploit the recent BABEL motion-text collection, which has a wide\nrange of labeled actions, many of which occur in a sequence with transitions\nbetween them. Next, we design a Transformer-based approach that operates\nnon-autoregressively within an action, but autoregressively within the sequence\nof actions. This hierarchical formulation proves effective in our experiments\nwhen compared with multiple baselines. Our approach, called TEACH for \"TEmporal\nAction Compositions for Human motions\", produces realistic human motions for a\nwide variety of actions and temporal compositions from language descriptions.\nTo encourage work on this new task, we make our code available for research\npurposes at $\\href{teach.is.tue.mpg.de}{\\textrm{our website}}$.",

    "abstract": "Human trafficking is a universal problem, persistent despite numerous efforts\nto combat it globally. Individuals of any age, race, ethnicity, sex, gender\nidentity, sexual orientation, nationality, immigration status, cultural\nbackground, religion, socioeconomic class, and education can be a victim of\nhuman trafficking. With the advancements in technology and the introduction of\nautonomous vehicles (AVs), human traffickers will adopt new ways to transport\nvictims, which could accelerate the growth of organized human trafficking\nnetworks, which can make the detection of trafficking in persons more\nchallenging for law enforcement agencies. The objective of this study is to\ndevelop an innovative audio analytics-based human trafficking detection\nframework for autonomous vehicles. The primary contributions of this study are\nto: (i) define four non-trivial, feasible, and realistic human trafficking\nscenarios for AVs; (ii) create a new and comprehensive audio dataset related to\nhuman trafficking with five classes i.e., crying, screaming, car door banging,\ncar noise, and conversation; and (iii) develop a deep 1-D Convolution Neural\nNetwork (CNN) architecture for audio data classification related to human\ntrafficking. We have also conducted a case study using the new audio dataset\nand evaluated the audio classification performance of the deep 1-D CNN. Our\nanalyses reveal that the deep 1-D CNN can distinguish sound coming from a human\ntrafficking victim from a non-human trafficking sound with an accuracy of 95%,\nwhich proves the efficacy of our framework.",

    "title": "Improving the Environmental Perception of Autonomous Vehicles using Deep  Learning-based Audio Classification",
    "abstract": "Sense of hearing is crucial for autonomous vehicles (AVs) to better perceive\nits surrounding environment. Although visual sensors of an AV, such as camera,\nlidar, and radar, help to see its surrounding environment, an AV cannot see\nbeyond those sensors line of sight. On the other hand, an AV s sense of hearing\ncannot be obstructed by line of sight. For example, an AV can identify an\nemergency vehicle s siren through audio classification even though the\nemergency vehicle is not within the line of sight of the AV. Thus, auditory\nperception is complementary to the camera, lidar, and radar-based perception\nsystems. This paper presents a deep learning-based robust audio classification\nframework aiming to achieve improved environmental perception for AVs. The\npresented framework leverages a deep Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to\nclassify different audio classes. UrbanSound8k, an urban environment dataset,\nis used to train and test the developed framework. Seven audio classes i.e.,\nair conditioner, car horn, children playing, dog bark, engine idling, gunshot,\nand siren, are identified from the UrbanSound8k dataset because of their\nrelevancy related to AVs. Our framework can classify different audio classes\nwith 97.82% accuracy. Moreover, the audio classification accuracies with all\nten classes are presented, which proves that our framework performed better in\nthe case of AV-related sounds compared to the existing audio classification\nframeworks.",

    "abstract": "We investigate an method for quantifying city characteristics based on\nimpressions of a sound environment. The quantification of the city\ncharacteristics will be beneficial to government policy planning, tourism\nprojects, etc. In this study, we try to predict two soundscape impressions,\nmeaning pleasantness and eventfulness, using sound data collected by the\ncloud-sensing method. The collected sounds comprise meta information of\nrecording location using Global Positioning System. Furthermore, the soundscape\nimpressions and sound-source features are separately assigned to the\ncloud-sensing sounds by assessments defined using Swedish Soundscape-Quality\nProtocol, assessing the quality of the acoustic environment. The prediction\nmodels are built using deep neural networks with multi-layer perceptron for the\ninput of 10-second sound and the aerial photographs of its location. An\nacoustic feature comprises equivalent noise level and outputs of octave-band\nfilters every second, and statistics of them in 10~s. An image feature is\nextracted from an aerial photograph using ResNet-50 and autoencoder\narchitecture. We perform comparison experiments to demonstrate the benefit of\neach feature. As a result of the comparison, aerial photographs and\nsound-source features are efficient to predict impression information.\nAdditionally, even if the sound-source features are predicted using acoustic\nand image features, the features also show fine results to predict the\nsoundscape impression close to the result of oracle sound-source features.",

    "title": "A Variational Approach to Parameter Estimation for Characterizing 2-D  Cluster Variation Method Topographies",
    "abstract": "One of the biggest challenges in characterizing 2-D topographies is\nsuccinctly communicating the dominant nature of local configurations. In a 2-D\ngrid composed of bistate units, this could be expressed as finding the\ncharacteristic configuration variables such as nearest-neighbor pairs and\ntriplet combinations. The 2-D cluster variation method (CVM) provides a\ntheoretical framework for associating a set of configuration variables with\nonly two parameters, for a system that is at free energy equilibrium. This work\npresents a method for determining which of many possible two-parameter sets\nprovides the ``most suitable'' match for a given 2-D topography, drawing from\nmethods used for variational inference.\nThis particular work focuses exclusively on topographies for which the\nactivation enthalpy parameter (epsilon_0) is zero, so that the distribution\nbetween two states is equiprobable. This condition is used since, when the two\nstates are equiprobable, there is an analytic solution giving the configuration\nvariable values as functions of the h-value, where we define h in terms of the\ninteraction enthalpy parameter (epsilon_1) as h = exp(2*epsilon_1). This allows\nthe computationally-achieved configuration variable values to be compared with\nthe analytically-predicted values for a given h-value.\nThe method is illustrated using four patterns derived from three different\nnaturally-occurring black-and-white topographies, where each pattern meets the\nequiprobability criterion.\nWe achieve expected results, that is, as the patterns progress from having\nrelatively low numbers of like-near-like nodes to increasing like-near-like\nmasses, the h-values for each corresponding free energy-minimized model also\nincrease. Further, the corresponding configuration variable values for the\n(free energy-minimized) model patterns are in approximate alignment with the\nanalytically-predicted values.",

    "abstract": "This paper analyzes the power imbalance issue in power-domain NOMA (PD-NOMA)\nin the presence of channel correlations, typically encountered on the downlink\nof cellular systems when the base station antennas have an insufficient\nseparation. In a recent paper, the authors analyzed this issue for a typical\nuplink scenario with uncorrelated channels, and the study revealed an\nastounding result that the optimum in terms of average error probability is\nachieved when the user signals are perfectly balanced in terms of power as in\nmulti-user MIMO with power control. This result led to some questioning of the\nconcept of PD-NOMA for uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels. In the present\npaper, we make a similar analysis for the downlink, and the study gives a very\nclear insight into the influence of the power imbalance at different levels of\nchannel correlation. First, with full correlation (user signals transmitted\nfrom the same antenna), the PD-NOMA concept reduces to simple signal\nconstellation design. The optimum is achieved when the power imbalance between\nthe user signals is such that the resulting constellation has uniform spacing.\nAny deviation from this optimum will lead to a hierarchical constellation with\nperformance loss. Also, this optimum power imbalance is shown to hold for a\nrange of strong channel correlations, but for moderate and low correlation\nvalues perfectly power balanced NOMA takes over as in the presence of\nuncorrelated channels.",

Marine coastal Autonomous Surface Vehicles\n(ASVs) that are regularly used for surveillance, monitoring and other routine\ntasks can benefit from this autonomy. Long haul deep sea transportation\nactivities are additional opportunities. These two use cases present very\ndifferent terrains -- the first being coastal waters -- with many obstacles,\nstructures and human presence while the latter is mostly devoid of such\nobstacles. Variations in environmental conditions are common to both terrains.\nRobust labeled datasets mapping such terrains are crucial in improving the\nsituational awareness that can drive autonomy.

In this paper, we fill this gap by\npresenting a labeled dataset of over 2,900 LWIR segmented images captured in\ncoastal maritime environment under diverse conditions. The images are labeled\nusing instance segmentation and classified in seven categories -- sky, water,\nobstacle, living obstacle, bridge, self and background. We also evaluate this\ndataset across three deep learning architectures (UNet, PSPNet, DeepLabv3) and\nprovide detailed analysis of its efficacy. While the dataset focuses on the\ncoastal terrain it can equally help deep sea use cases.

In contrast to imitation learning,\nthere is no expert data, only the data collected through environmental\nexploration. Compared with offline reinforcement learning, the problem of data\ndistribution shift is more serious. Since the action sequence to solve the new\ntask may be the combination of trajectory segments of multiple training tasks,\nin other words, the test task and the solving strategy do not exist directly in\nthe training data. This makes the problem more difficult. We propose a\nMemory-related Multi-task Method (M3) to address this problem. The method\nconsists of three stages. First, task-agnostic exploration is carried out to\ncollect data. Different from previous methods, we organize the exploration data\ninto a knowledge graph. We design a model based on the exploration data to\nextract action effect features and save them in memory, while an action\npredictive model is trained. Secondly, for a new task, the action effect\nfeatures stored in memory are used to generate candidate actions by a feature\ndecomposition-based approach. Finally, a multi-scale candidate action pool and\nthe action predictive model are fused to generate a strategy to complete the\ntask.

To deal with this problem, recent studies focus on the\nIP protection of DNNs by applying digital watermarking, which embeds source\ninformation and/or authentication data into DNN models by tuning network\nparameters directly or indirectly.

    "abstract": "Infinite width limit has shed light on generalization and optimization\naspects of deep learning by establishing connections between neural networks\nand kernel methods. Despite their importance, the utility of these kernel\nmethods was limited in large-scale learning settings due to their\n(super-)quadratic runtime and memory complexities. Moreover, most prior works\non neural kernels have focused on the ReLU activation, mainly due to its\npopularity but also due to the difficulty of computing such kernels for general\nactivations. In this work, we overcome such difficulties by providing methods\nto work with general activations. First, we compile and expand the list of\nactivation functions admitting exact dual activation expressions to compute\nneural kernels. When the exact computation is unknown, we present methods to\neffectively approximate them. We propose a fast sketching method that\napproximates any multi-layered Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP) kernel\nand Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) matrices for a wide range of activation\nfunctions, going beyond the commonly analyzed ReLU activation. This is done by\nshowing how to approximate the neural kernels using the truncated Hermite\nexpansion of any desired activation functions. While most prior works require\ndata points on the unit sphere, our methods do not suffer from such limitations\nand are applicable to any dataset of points in $\\mathbb{R}^d$.

    "title": "Maximizing Utilization under Time-Varying Resource Requirements",
    "abstract": "Low utilization has been one of the key limiting factors for the continued\nscaling of today's computing systems. One main reason for the low utilization\nis the temporal variation in the actual resource requirements of jobs, because\nreserving resources for jobs based on the peak requirements then results in\nidle resources for non-peak time. To increase utilization, in practice,\nresources are often overcommitted, so jobs may need to contend for resources at\ntimes and experience performance degradation, incurring a cost. To make use of\nthe flexibility in resource allocation provided by overcommitment to the best\nadvantage, it is critical to answer the following fundamental question that has\nnot been well studied: given an acceptable budget for the cost associated with\nresource contention, how can we achieve the maximum utilization of the system?\nIn this paper, we propose a job model that captures the time-varying resource\nrequirement of each job by a Markov chain. We consider a stochastic formulation\nof the job dispatch problem in an infinite-server system. Our goal is to\nmaximize system utilization by minimizing the number of active servers (servers\nrunning at least one job), subject to a budget on the cost of resource\ncontention. Our main result is the design of a job dispatch policy that is\nasymptotically optimal as the job arrival rate increases. The novel technical\nframework that we develop reduces the policy design problem under study to that\nin a single-server system through policy conversions, which may be of\nindependent interest. The framework allows us to design the asymptotically\noptimal policy by solving a linear program.",

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have various advantages, but their practical\napplications are influenced by their limited energy. Therefore, it is important\nto manage their power consumption and also important to establish corresponding\npower consumption models. However, most of existing works either establish\ntheoretical power consumption models for fixed-wing UAVs and single-rotor UAVs,\nor provide heuristic power consumption models for multi-rotor UAVs without\nrigorous mathematical derivations. This paper aims to establish theoretical\npower consumption models for multi-rotor UAVs. To be specific, the closed-form\npower consumption models for a multi-rotor UAV in three flight statuses, i.e.,\nforward flight, vertical ascent and vertical descent, are derived by leveraging\nthe relationship between single-rotor UAVs and multi-rotor UAVs in terms of\npower consumptions. On this basis, a generic flight power consumption model for\nthe UAV in a three-dimensional (3-D) scenario is obtained. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted by using DJI M210 and a mobile app made by DJI Mobile\nSDK in real scenarios, and confirm the correctness and effectiveness of these\nmodels; in addition, simulations are performed to further investigate the\neffect of the rotor numbers on the power consumption for the UAV. The proposed\npower consumption models not only reveal how the power consumption of\nmulti-rotor UAVs are affected by various factors, but also pave the way for\nintroducing other novel applications.",

To this end, we take a deep and complex\nconvolutional neural network, known as residual neural network (ResNet), as the\nteacher model. ResNet is specifically designed for multivariate time-series\nclassification. We use ResNet to distil the knowledge of animal behavior\nclassification datasets into soft labels, which consist of the predicted\npseudo-probabilities of every class for each datapoint. We then use the soft\nlabels to train our significantly less complex student models, which are based\non the gated recurrent unit (GRU) and multilayer perceptron (MLP). The\nevaluation results using two real-world animal behavior classification datasets\nshow that the classification accuracy of the student GRU-MLP models improves\nappreciably through KD, approaching that of the teacher ResNet model. To\nfurther reduce the computational and memory requirements of performing\ninference using the student models trained via KD, we utilize dynamic\nfixed-point quantization through an appropriate modification of the\ncomputational graphs of the models. We implement both unquantized and quantized\nversions of the developed KD-based models on the embedded systems of our\npurpose-built collar and ear tag devices to classify animal behavior in situ\nand in real time.

    "abstract": "Analyzing large graph data is an essential part of many modern applications,\nsuch as social networks. Due to its large computational complexity, distributed\nprocessing is frequently employed. This requires graph data to be divided\nacross nodes, and the choice of partitioning strategy has a great impact on the\nexecution time of the task. Yet, there is no one-size-fits-all partitioning\nstrategy that performs well on arbitrary graph data and algorithms. The\nperformance of a strategy depends on the characteristics of the graph data and\nalgorithms. Moreover, due to the complexity of graph data and algorithms,\nmanually identifying the best partitioning strategy is also infeasible. In this\nwork, we propose a machine learning-based approach to select the most\nappropriate partitioning strategy for a given graph and processing algorithm.\nOur approach enumerates viable partitioning strategies, predicts the execution\ntime of the target algorithm for each, and selects the partitioning strategy\nwith the fastest estimated execution time. Our machine learning model is\ntrained on features extracted from graph data and algorithm pseudo-code. We\nalso propose a method that augments real execution logs of graph tasks to\ncreate a large synthetic dataset. Evaluation results show that the strategies\nselected by our approach lead to 1.46X faster execution time on average\ncompared with the mean execution time of the partitioning strategies and about\n0.95X the performance compared to the best partitioning strategy.",

This paper presents a\nnew framework called Image as Stepping Stone (ISS) for the task by introducing\n2D image as a stepping stone to connect the two modalities and to eliminate the\nneed for paired text-shape data. Our key contribution is a two-stage\nfeature-space-alignment approach that maps CLIP features to shapes by\nharnessing a pre-trained single-view reconstruction (SVR) model with multi-view\nsupervisions: first map the CLIP image feature to the detail-rich shape space\nin the SVR model, then map the CLIP text feature to the shape space and\noptimize the mapping by encouraging CLIP consistency between the input text and\nthe rendered images. Further, we formulate a text-guided shape stylization\nmodule to dress up the output shapes with novel textures. Beyond existing works\non 3D shape generation from text, our new approach is general for creating\nshapes in a broad range of categories, without requiring paired text-shape\ndata.

    "abstract": "Edge training of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is a desirable goal for\ncontinuous learning; however, it is hindered by the enormous computational\npower required by training. Hardware approximate multipliers have shown their\neffectiveness for gaining resource-efficiency in DNN inference accelerators;\nhowever, training with approximate multipliers is largely unexplored. To build\nresource efficient accelerators with approximate multipliers supporting DNN\ntraining, a thorough evaluation of training convergence and accuracy for\ndifferent DNN architectures and different approximate multipliers is needed.\nThis paper presents ApproxTrain, an open-source framework that allows fast\nevaluation of DNN training and inference using simulated approximate\nmultipliers. ApproxTrain is as user-friendly as TensorFlow (TF) and requires\nonly a high-level description of a DNN architecture along with C/C++ functional\nmodels of the approximate multiplier. We improve the speed of the simulation at\nthe multiplier level by using a novel LUT-based approximate floating-point (FP)\nmultiplier simulator on GPU (AMSim). ApproxTrain leverages CUDA and efficiently\nintegrates AMSim into the TensorFlow library, in order to overcome the absence\nof native hardware approximate multiplier in commercial GPUs. We use\nApproxTrain to evaluate the convergence and accuracy of DNN training with\napproximate multipliers for small and large datasets (including ImageNet) using\nLeNets and ResNets architectures. The evaluations demonstrate similar\nconvergence behavior and negligible change in test accuracy compared to FP32\nand bfloat16 multipliers. Compared to CPU-based approximate multiplier\nsimulations in training and inference, the GPU-accelerated ApproxTrain is more\nthan 2500x faster. Based on highly optimized closed-source cuDNN/cuBLAS\nlibraries with native hardware multipliers, the original TensorFlow is only 8x\nfaster than ApproxTrain.",

For example, in maximizing exact match accuracy, we provide\nthe mode of the distribution. But how does this relate to the confidence we may\nhave in such an estimate? Confidence is an important element of real-world\napplications of multi-label classifiers (as in machine learning in general) and\nis an important ingredient in explainability and interpretability. However, it\nis not obvious how to provide confidence in the multi-label context and\nrelating to a particular accuracy metric, and nor is it clear how to provide a\nconfidence which correlates well with the expected accuracy, which would be\nmost valuable in real-world decision making. In this article we estimate the\nexpected accuracy as a surrogate for confidence, for a given accuracy metric.\nWe hypothesise that the expected accuracy can be estimated from the multi-label\npredictive distribution. We examine seven candidate functions for their ability\nto estimate expected accuracy from the predictive distribution. We found three\nof these to correlate to expected accuracy and are robust.

    "abstract": "The incorporation of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) into massive\nmultiple-input-multiple-output (mMIMO) systems can unleash the potential of\nnext-generation networks by improving the performance of user equipments (UEs)\nin service dead zones. However, their requirement for accurate channel state\ninformation (CSI) is critical, and especially, applications with UE mobility\nthat induce channel aging make challenging the achievement of adequate quality\nof service. Hence, in this work, we investigate the impact of channel aging on\nthe performance of RIS-assisted mMIMO systems under both spatial correlation\nand imperfect CSI conditions. Specifically, by accounting for channel aging\nduring both uplink training and downlink data transmission phases, we first\nperform minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel estimation to obtain the UE\neffective channels with low overhead similar to conventional systems without\nRIS. Next, we derive the downlink achievable sum spectral efficiency (SE) with\nregularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding in closed-form being dependent only on\nlarge-scale statistics by using the deterministic equivalent (DE) analysis.\nSubsequently, we present the attractive optimization of the achievable sum SE\nwith respect to the phase shifts and the total transmit power that can be\nperformed every several coherence intervals due to the slow variation of the\nlarge-scale statistics. Numerical results validate the analytical expressions\nand demonstrate the performance while allowing the extraction of insightful\ndesign conclusions for common scenarios including UE mobility. In particular,\nchannel aging degrades the performance but its impact can be controlled by\nchoosing appropriately the frame duration or by increasing the number of RIS\nelements.",

While\nproviding highly accurate predictions, these models often lack transparency,\nacting as \"black boxes\". This criticism has grown to the point that explanation\nis now considered very relevant in terms of acceptability and reliability. In\nthis paper, we addressed this issue by inspecting the ADMNC (Anomaly Detection\non Mixed Numerical and Categorical Spaces) model, an existing very accurate\nalthough opaque anomaly detector capable to operate with both numerical and\ncategorical inputs. This work presents the extension EADMNC (Explainable\nAnomaly Detection on Mixed Numerical and Categorical spaces), which adds\nexplainability to the predictions obtained with the original model. We\npreserved the scalability of the original method thanks to the Apache Spark\nframework. EADMNC leverages the formulation of the previous ADMNC model to\noffer pre hoc and post hoc explainability, while maintaining the accuracy of\nthe original architecture. We present a pre hoc model that globally explains\nthe outputs by segmenting input data into homogeneous groups, described with\nonly a few variables. We designed a graphical representation based on\nregression trees, which supervisors can inspect to understand the differences\nbetween normal and anomalous data. Our post hoc explanations consist of a\ntext-based template method that locally provides textual arguments supporting\neach detection.

    "abstract": "Although previous graph-based multi-view clustering algorithms have gained\nsignificant progress, most of them are still faced with three limitations.\nFirst, they often suffer from high computational complexity, which restricts\ntheir applications in large-scale scenarios. Second, they usually perform graph\nlearning either at the single-view level or at the view-consensus level, but\noften neglect the possibility of the joint learning of single-view and\nconsensus graphs. Third, many of them rely on the $k$-means for discretization\nof the spectral embeddings, which lack the ability to directly learn the graph\nwith discrete cluster structure. In light of this, this paper presents an\nefficient multi-view clustering approach via unified and discrete bipartite\ngraph learning (UDBGL). Specifically, the anchor-based subspace learning is\nincorporated to learn the view-specific bipartite graphs from multiple views,\nupon which the bipartite graph fusion is leveraged to learn a view-consensus\nbipartite graph with adaptive weight learning. Further, the Laplacian rank\nconstraint is imposed to ensure that the fused bipartite graph has discrete\ncluster structures (with a specific number of connected components). By\nsimultaneously formulating the view-specific bipartite graph learning, the\nview-consensus bipartite graph learning, and the discrete cluster structure\nlearning into a unified objective function, an efficient minimization algorithm\nis then designed to tackle this optimization problem and directly achieve a\ndiscrete clustering solution without requiring additional partitioning, which\nnotably has linear time complexity in data size.

    "abstract": "One of the most crucial aspects of communication in daily life is speech\nrecognition. Speech recognition that is based on natural language processing is\none of the essential elements in the conversion of one system to another. In\nthis paper, we created an interface that transforms speech and other auditory\ninputs into text using a digital filter. Contrary to the many methods for this\nconversion, it is also possible for linguistic faults to appear occasionally,\ngender recognition, speech recognition that is unsuccessful (cannot recognize\nvoice), and gender recognition to fail. Since technical problems are involved,\nwe developed a program that acts as a mediator to prevent initiating software\nissues in order to eliminate even this little deviation. Its planned MFCC and\nHMM are in sync with its AI system. As a result, technical errors have been\navoided.",

Based on the local\ntangential cone condition and the Jensen's inequality, we prove convergence of\nour method with two different assumptions. Then, for solving nonlinear\nequations with the convex constraints we present two variants of the NSKM\nmethod: the projected sampling Kaczmarz-Motzkin (PSKM) method and the\naccelerated projected sampling Kaczmarz-Motzkin (APSKM) method. With the use of\nthe nonexpansive property of the projection and the convergence of the NSKM\nmethod, the convergence analysis is obtained. Numerical results show that the\nNSKM method with the sample of the suitable size outperforms the nonlinear\nrandomized Kaczmarz (NRK) method in terms of calculation times.

    "abstract": "A substantial fraction of the time that computational modellers dedicate to\ndeveloping their models is actually spent trouble-shooting and debugging their\ncode. However, how this process unfolds is seldom spoken about, maybe because\nit is hard to articulate as it relies mostly on the mental catalogues we have\nbuilt with the experience of past failures. To help newcomers to the field of\nmaterial modelling, here we attempt to fill this gap and provide a perspective\non how to identify and fix mistakes in computational solid mechanics models. To\nthis aim, we describe the components that make up such a model and then\nidentify possible sources of errors. In practice, finding mistakes is often\nbetter done by considering the symptoms of what is going wrong. As a\nconsequence, we provide strategies to narrow down where in the model the\nproblem may be, based on observation and a catalogue of frequent causes of\nobserved errors. In a final section, we also discuss how one-time bug-free\nmodels can be kept bug-free in view of the fact that computational models are\ntypically under continual development. We hope that this collection of\napproaches and suggestions serves as a \"road map\" to find and fix mistakes in\ncomputational models, and more importantly, keep the problems solved so that\nmodellers can enjoy the beauty of material modelling and simulation",

However, the current models usually learn a generic\nrepresentation base on the class label on each task and an effective strategy\nis selected to avoid catastrophic forgetting. We postulate that selecting the\nrelated and useful parts only from the knowledge obtained to perform each task\nis more effective than utilizing the whole knowledge. Based on this fact, in\nthis paper we propose a new framework, named Selecting Related Knowledge for\nOnline Continual Learning (SRKOCL), which incorporates an additional efficient\nchannel attention mechanism to pick the particular related knowledge for every\ntask. Our model also combines experience replay and knowledge distillation to\ncircumvent the catastrophic forgetting.

The\ntraditional way of training GNNs depends on a great many labeled data, which\nresults in high requirements on cost and time. In some special scene, it is\neven unavailable and impracticable. Self-supervised representation learning,\nwhich can generate labels by graph structure data itself, is a potential\napproach to tackle this problem. And turning to research on self-supervised\nlearning problem for heterogeneous graphs is more challenging than dealing with\nhomogeneous graphs, also there are fewer studies about it. In this paper, we\npropose a SElfsupervised learning method for heterogeneous graph via Structure\nInformation based on Metapath (SESIM). The proposed model can construct pretext\ntasks by predicting jump number between nodes in each metapath to improve the\nrepresentation ability of primary task. In order to predict jump number, SESIM\nuses data itself to generate labels, avoiding time-consuming manual labeling.\nMoreover, predicting jump number in each metapath can effectively utilize graph\nstructure information, which is the essential property between nodes.\nTherefore, SESIM deepens the understanding of models for graph structure. At\nlast, we train primary task and pretext tasks jointly, and use meta-learning to\nbalance the contribution of pretext tasks for primary task. Empirical results\nvalidate the performance of SESIM method and demonstrate that this method can\nimprove the representation ability of traditional neural networks on link\nprediction task and node classification task.",

Our method is\nbased on a convolutional neural network model that incorporates a pre-trained\nStyleGAN generator. We model each frame as a point in the latent space of\nStyleGAN so that a video corresponds to a trajectory through the latent space.\nTraining the network is in two stages. The first stage is to model trajectories\nin the latent space conditioned on speech utterances. To do this, we use an\nexisting encoder to invert the generator, mapping from each video frame into\nthe latent space. We train a recurrent neural network to map from speech\nutterances to displacements in the latent space of the image generator. These\ndisplacements are relative to the back-projection into the latent space of an\nidentity image chosen from the individuals depicted in the training dataset. In\nthe second stage, we improve the visual quality of the generated videos by\ntuning the image generator on a single image or a short video of any chosen\nidentity. We evaluate our model on standard measures (PSNR, SSIM, FID and LMD)\nand show that it significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods on\none of two commonly used datasets and gives comparable performance on the\nother.

    "abstract": "We explore the separability of point sets in the plane by a\nrestricted-orientation convex hull, which is an orientation-dependent, possibly\ndisconnected, and non-convex enclosing shape that generalizes the convex hull.\nLet $R$ and $B$ be two disjoint sets of red and blue points in the plane, and\n$\\mathcal{O}$ be a set of $k \\geq 2$ lines passing through the origin. We study\nthe problem of computing the set of orientations of the lines of $\\mathcal{O}$\nfor which the $\\mathcal{O}$-convex hull of $R$ contains no points of $B$.\nFor $k=2$ orthogonal lines we have the rectilinear convex hull. In optimal\n$O(n \\log n)$ time and $O(n)$ space, $n = \\vert R \\vert + \\vert B \\vert$, we\ncompute the set of rotation angles such that, after simultaneously rotating the\nlines of $\\mathcal{O}$ around the origin in the same direction, the rectilinear\nconvex hull of $R$ contains no points of $B$. We generalize this result to the\ncase where $\\mathcal{O}$ is formed by $k \\geq 2$ lines with arbitrary\norientations. In the counter-clockwise circular order of the lines of\n$\\mathcal{O}$, let $\\alpha_i$ be the angle required to clockwise rotate the\n$i$th line so it coincides with its successor. We solve the problem in this\ncase in $O(1/\\Theta \\cdot N \\log N)$ time and $O(1/\\Theta \\cdot N)$ space,\nwhere $\\Theta = \\min \\{ \\alpha_1,\\ldots,\\alpha_k \\}$ and $N=\\max\\{k,\\vert R\n\\vert + \\vert B \\vert \\}$. We finally consider the case in which $\\mathcal{O}$\nis formed by $k=2$ lines, one of the lines is fixed, and the second line\nrotates by an angle that goes from $0$ to $\\pi$. We show that this last case\ncan also be solved in optimal $O(n\\log n)$ time and $O(n)$ space, where $n =\n\\vert R \\vert + \\vert B \\vert$.",

    "abstract": "Deep Learning has received increased attention due to its unbeatable success\nin many fields, such as computer vision, natural language processing,\nrecommendation systems, and most recently in simulating multiphysics problems\nand predicting nonlinear dynamical systems. However, modeling and forecasting\nthe dynamics of chaotic systems remains an open research problem since training\ndeep learning models requires big data, which is not always available in many\ncases. Such deep learners can be trained from additional information obtained\nfrom simulated results and by enforcing the physical laws of the chaotic\nsystems. This paper considers extreme events and their dynamics and proposes\nelegant models based on deep neural networks, called knowledge-based deep\nlearning (KDL). Our proposed KDL can learn the complex patterns governing\nchaotic systems by jointly training on real and simulated data directly from\nthe dynamics and their differential equations. This knowledge is transferred to\nmodel and forecast real-world chaotic events exhibiting extreme behavior. We\nvalidate the efficiency of our model by assessing it on three real-world\nbenchmark datasets: El Nino sea surface temperature, San Juan Dengue viral\ninfection, and Bj{\\o}rn{\\o}ya daily precipitation, all governed by extreme\nevents' dynamics. Using prior knowledge of extreme events and physics-based\nloss functions to lead the neural network learning, we ensure physically\nconsistent, generalizable, and accurate forecasting, even in a small data\nregime.",

    "abstract": "Mobile parcel lockers (MPLs) have been recently proposed by logistics\noperators as a technology that could help reduce traffic congestion and\noperational costs in urban freight distribution. Given their ability to\nrelocate throughout their area of deployment, they hold the potential to\nimprove customer accessibility and convenience. In this study, we formulate the\nMobile Parcel Locker Problem (MPLP), a special case of the Location-Routing\nProblem (LRP) which determines the optimal stopover location for MPLs\nthroughout the day and plans corresponding delivery routes. A Hybrid\nQ-Learning-Network-based Method (HQM) is developed to resolve the computational\ncomplexity of the resulting large problem instances while escaping local\noptima. In addition, the HQM is integrated with global and local search\nmechanisms to resolve the dilemma of exploration and exploitation faced by\nclassic reinforcement learning (RL) methods. We examine the performance of HQM\nunder different problem sizes (up to 200 nodes) and benchmarked it against the\nGenetic Algorithm (GA). Our results indicate that the average reward obtained\nby HQM is 1.96 times greater than GA, which demonstrates that HQM has a better\noptimisation ability. Finally, we identify critical factors that contribute to\nfleet size requirements, travel distances, and service delays. Our findings\noutline that the efficiency of MPLs is mainly contingent on the length of time\nwindows and the deployment of MPL stopovers.",

Locating a device from distance\nmeasurements is typically phrased as a non-convex optimization problem,\nstemming from the nonlinearity of the measurement model.

In this paper, we design an\noptimality certificate for continuous-time range-only localization. Our\nformulation allows for the integration of a motion prior, which ensures\nsmoothness of the solution and is crucial for localizing from only a few\ndistance measurements. The proposed certificate comes at little additional cost\nsince it has the same complexity as the sparse local solver itself: linear in\nthe number of positions. We show, both in simulation and on real-world\ndatasets, that the efficient local solver often finds the globally optimal\nsolution (confirmed by our certificate) and when it does not, simple random\nreinitialization eventually leads to the certifiable optimum.",

    "abstract": "A key challenge for a common waveform for Integrated Sensing and\nCommunications (ISAC) - widely seen as an attractive proposition to achieve\nhigh performance for both functionalities, while efficiently utilizing\navailable resources -- lies in leveraging information-bearing channel-coded\ncommunications signals (c.c.s) for sensing. In this paper, we investigate the\nsensing performance of c.c.s in (multi-user) interference-limited operation,\nand show that it is limited by sidelobes in the range-Doppler map, whose form\ndepends on whether the c.c.s modulates a single-carrier or OFDM waveform. While\nuncoded communications signals -- comprising a block of $N$ i.i.d zero-mean\nsymbols -- give rise to asymptotically (i.e., as $N \\rightarrow \\infty$) zero\nsidelobes due to the law of large numbers, it is not obvious that the same\nholds for c.c.s, as structured channel coding schemes (e.g., linear block\ncodes) induce dependence across codeword symbols. In this paper, we show that\nc.c.s also give rise to asymptotically zero sidelobes -- for both\nsingle-carrier and OFDM waveforms -- by deriving upper bounds for the tail\nprobabilities of the sidelobe magnitudes that decay as $\\exp( - O($code rate\n$\\times$ block length$))$. This implies that for any code rate, c.c.s are\neffective sensing signals that are robust to multi-user interference at\nsufficiently large block lengths, with negligible difference in performance\nbased on whether they modulate a single-carrier or OFDM waveform. We verify the\nlatter implication through simulations, where we observe the sensing\nperformance (characterized by the detection and false-alarm probabilities) of a\nQPSK-modulated c.c.s (code rate = 120/1024, block length = 1024 symbols) to\nmatch that of a comparable interference-free FMCW waveform even at high\ninterference levels (signal-to-interference ratio of -11dB), for both\nsingle-carrier and OFDM waveforms.",

    "abstract": "Action recognition is a fundamental capability for humanoid robots to\ninteract and cooperate with humans. This application requires the action\nrecognition system to be designed so that new actions can be easily added,\nwhile unknown actions are identified and ignored. In recent years,\ndeep-learning approaches represented the principal solution to the Action\nRecognition problem. However, most models often require a large dataset of\nmanually-labeled samples. In this work we target One-Shot deep-learning models,\nbecause they can deal with just a single instance for class.

Few-Shot Open-Set Recognition (FSOSR) solutions attempt to address that\nflaw, but current solutions consider only static images and not sequences of\nimages. Static images remain insufficient to discriminate actions such as\nsitting-down and standing-up. In this paper we propose a novel model that\naddresses the FSOSR problem with a One-Shot model that is augmented with a\ndiscriminator that rejects unknown actions. This model is useful for\napplications in humanoid robotics, because it allows to easily add new classes\nand determine whether an input sequence is among the ones that are known to the\nsystem.

    "abstract": "Many robotic tasks involving some form of 3D visual perception greatly\nbenefit from a complete knowledge of the working environment. However, robots\noften have to tackle unstructured environments and their onboard visual sensors\ncan only provide incomplete information due to limited workspaces, clutter or\nobject self-occlusion. In recent years, deep learning architectures for shape\ncompletion have begun taking traction as effective means of inferring a\ncomplete 3D object representation from partial visual data. Nevertheless, most\nof the existing state-of-the-art approaches provide a fixed output resolution\nin the form of voxel grids, strictly related to the size of the neural network\noutput stage. While this is enough for some tasks, e.g. obstacle avoidance in\nnavigation, grasping and manipulation require finer resolutions and simply\nscaling up the neural network outputs is computationally expensive. In this\npaper, we address this limitation by proposing an object shape completion\nmethod based on an implicit 3D representation providing a confidence value for\neach reconstructed point. As a second contribution, we propose a gradient-based\nmethod for efficiently sampling such implicit function at an arbitrary\nresolution, tunable at inference time.

    "abstract": "OpenMP is the de facto API for parallel programming in HPC applications.\nThese programs are often computed in data centers, where energy consumption is\na major issue. Whereas previous work has focused almost entirely on\nperformance, we here analyse aspects of OpenMP from an energy consumption\nperspective. This analysis is accomplished by executing novel microbenchmarks\nand common benchmark suites on data center nodes and measuring the energy\nconsumption. Three main aspects are analysed: directive-generated loop tiling\nand unrolling, parallel for loops and explicit tasking, and the policy of\nhandling blocked threads. For loop tiling and unrolling, we find that tiling\ncan yield significant energy savings for some, mostly unoptimised programs,\nwhile directive-generated unrolling provides very minor improvement in the best\ncase and degenerates performance majorly in the worst case. For the second\naspect, we find that parallel for loops yield better results than explicit\ntasking loops in cases where both can be used. This becomes more prominent with\nmore fine-grained workloads. For the third, we find that significant energy\nsavings can be made by not descheduling waiting threads, but instead having\nthem spin, at the cost of a higher power consumption. We also analyse how the\nchoice of compiler affects the above questions by compiling programs with each\nof ICC, Clang and GCC, and find that while neither is strictly better than the\nothers, they can produce very different results for the same compiled programs.\nAs a final step, we combine the findings of all results and suggest novel\ncompiler directives as well as general recommendations on how to reduce energy\nconsumption in OpenMP programs.",

However, these approaches have a limitation of\ncontrolling the fine-grained semantics of augmented views of a sentence.

In this work, we found that using neighbor sentences\nenables capturing a more accurate semantic similarity between similar\nsentences. Based on this finding, we propose RankEncoder, which uses relations\nbetween an input sentence and sentences in a corpus for training unsupervised\nsentence encoders. We evaluate RankEncoder from three perspectives: 1) the\nsemantic textual similarity performance, 2) the efficacy on similar sentence\npairs, and 3) the universality of RankEncoder. Experimental results show that\nRankEncoder achieves 80.07\\% Spearman's correlation, a 1.1% absolute\nimprovement compared to the previous state-of-the-art performance.

    "abstract": "Advanced reactors deployed in the coming decades will face deregulated energy\nmarkets, and may adopt flexible operation to boost profitability. To aid in the\ntransition from baseload to flexible operation paradigm, autonomous operation\nis sought. This work focuses on the control aspect of autonomous operation.\nSpecifically, a hierarchical control system is designed to support constraint\nenforcement during routine operational transients. Within the system,\ndata-driven modeling, physics-based state observation, and classical control\nalgorithms are integrated to provide an adaptable and robust solution. A 320 MW\nFluoride-cooled High-temperature Pebble-bed Reactor is the design basis for\ndemonstrating the control system.\nThe hierarchical control system consists of a supervisory layer and low-level\nlayer. The supervisory layer receives requests to change the system's operating\nconditions, and accepts or rejects them based on constraints that have been\nassigned. Constraints are issued to keep the plant within an optimal operating\nregion. The low-level layer interfaces with the actuators of the system to\nfulfill requested changes, while maintaining tracking and regulation duties. To\naccept requests at the supervisory layer, the Reference Governor algorithm was\nadopted. To model the dynamics of the reactor, a system identification\nalgorithm, Dynamic Mode Decomposition, was utilized. To estimate the evolution\nof process variables that cannot be directly measured, the Unscented Kalman\nFilter was adopted, incorporating a nonlinear model of nuclear dynamics. The\ncomposition of these algorithms led to a numerical demonstration of constraint\nenforcement during a 40 % power drop transient. Adaptability of the proposed\nsystem was demonstrated by modifying the constraint values, and enforcing them\nduring the transient. Robustness was also demonstrated by enforcing constraints\nunder noisy environments.",

For scaled autonomous racing platforms, the\ncomputational constraint and complexity often limit the use of Model Predictive\nControl (MPC). As a consequence, geometric controllers are the most frequently\ndeployed controllers. They prove to be performant while yielding implementation\nand operational simplicity.

    "abstract": "Cough audio signal classification is a potentially useful tool in screening\nfor respiratory disorders, such as COVID-19. Since it is dangerous to collect\ndata from patients with such contagious diseases, many research teams have\nturned to crowdsourcing to quickly gather cough sound data, as it was done to\ngenerate the COUGHVID dataset. The COUGHVID dataset enlisted expert physicians\nto diagnose the underlying diseases present in a limited number of uploaded\nrecordings. However, this approach suffers from potential mislabeling of the\ncoughs, as well as notable disagreement between experts. In this work, we use a\nsemi-supervised learning (SSL) approach to improve the labeling consistency of\nthe COUGHVID dataset and the robustness of COVID-19 versus healthy cough sound\nclassification. First, we leverage existing SSL expert knowledge aggregation\ntechniques to overcome the labeling inconsistencies and sparsity in the\ndataset. Next, our SSL approach is used to identify a subsample of re-labeled\nCOUGHVID audio samples that can be used to train or augment future cough\nclassification models. The consistency of the re-labeled data is demonstrated\nin that it exhibits a high degree of class separability, 3x higher than that of\nthe user-labeled data, despite the expert label inconsistency present in the\noriginal dataset. Furthermore, the spectral differences in the user-labeled\naudio segments are amplified in the re-labeled data, resulting in significantly\ndifferent power spectral densities between healthy and COVID-19 coughs, which\ndemonstrates both the increased consistency of the new dataset and its\nexplainability from an acoustic perspective. Finally, we demonstrate how the\nre-labeled dataset can be used to train a cough classifier. This SSL approach\ncan be used to combine the medical knowledge of several experts to improve the\ndatabase consistency for any diagnostic classification task.",

Furthermore, for every optimal objective\nvalue, we decompose the construction of an associated optimal~$(0,1)$-matrix\ninto a series of sorting processes, respectively agreeing with the rule of\nthumb \"peak shaving\" or \"valley filling.\" We show that the resulting algorithms\nhave linear time complexities and verify their empirical efficiency via\nnumerical simulations compared to the standard order-preserving method for POP.",

    "title": "Energy-Aware JPEG Image Compression: A Multi-Objective Approach",
    "abstract": "Customer satisfaction is crucially affected by energy consumption in mobile\ndevices. One of the most energy-consuming parts of an application is images.\nWhile different images with different quality consume different amounts of\nenergy, there are no straightforward methods to calculate the energy\nconsumption of an operation in a typical image. This paper, first, investigates\nthat there is a correlation between energy consumption and image quality as\nwell as image file size. Therefore, these two can be considered as a proxy for\nenergy consumption. Then, we propose a multi-objective strategy to enhance\nimage quality and reduce image file size based on the quantisation tables in\nJPEG image compression. To this end, we have used two general multi-objective\nmetaheuristic approaches: scalarisation and Pareto-based. Scalarisation methods\nfind a single optimal solution based on combining different objectives, while\nPareto-based techniques aim to achieve a set of solutions. In this paper, we\nembed our strategy into five scalarisation algorithms, including energy-aware\nmulti-objective genetic algorithm (EnMOGA), energy-aware multi-objective\nparticle swarm optimisation (EnMOPSO), energy-aware multi-objective\ndifferential evolution (EnMODE), energy-aware multi-objective evolutionary\nstrategy (EnMOES), and energy-aware multi-objective pattern search (EnMOPS).\nAlso, two Pareto-based methods, including a non-dominated sorting genetic\nalgorithm (NSGA-II) and a reference-point-based NSGA-II (NSGA-III) are used for\nthe embedding scheme, and two Pareto-based algorithms, EnNSGAII and EnNSGAIII,\nare presented. Experimental studies show that the performance of the baseline\nalgorithm is improved by embedding the proposed strategy into metaheuristic\nalgorithms.",

    "abstract": "Consensus algorithms form the foundation for many distributed algorithms by\nenabling multiple robots to converge to consistent estimates of global\nvariables using only local communication. However, standard consensus protocols\ncan be easily led astray by non-cooperative team members. As such, the study of\nresilient forms of consensus is necessary for designing resilient distributed\nalgorithms. W-MSR consensus is one such resilient consensus algorithm that\nallows for resilient consensus with only local knowledge of the communication\ngraph and no a priori model for the data being shared. However, the\nverification that a given communication graph meets the strict graph\nconnectivity requirement makes W-MSR difficult to use in practice. In this\npaper, we show that a commonly used communication graph structure in robotics\nliterature, the communication graph built based on the Voronoi tessellation,\nautomatically results in a sufficiently connected graph to reject a single\nnon-cooperative team member. Further, we show how this graph can be enhanced to\nreject two non-cooperative team members and provide a roadmap for modifications\nfor further resilience.

    "abstract": "User trust is a crucial consideration in designing robust visual analytics\nsystems that can guide users to reasonably sound conclusions despite inevitable\nbiases and other uncertainties introduced by the human, the machine, and the\ndata sources which paint the canvas upon which knowledge emerges. A multitude\nof factors emerge upon studied consideration which introduce considerable\ncomplexity and exacerbate our understanding of how trust relationships evolve\nin visual analytics systems, much as they do in intelligent sociotechnical\nsystems. A visual analytics system, however, does not by its nature provoke\nexactly the same phenomena as its simpler cousins, nor are the phenomena\nnecessarily of the same exact kind. Regardless, both application domains\npresent the same root causes from which the need for trustworthiness arises:\nUncertainty and the assumption of risk. In addition, visual analytics systems,\neven more than the intelligent systems which (traditionally) tend to be closed\nto direct human input and direction during processing, are influenced by a\nmultitude of cognitive biases that further exacerbate an accounting of the\nuncertainties that may afflict the user's confidence, and ultimately trust in\nthe system.\nIn this article we argue that accounting for the propagation of uncertainty\nfrom data sources all the way through extraction of information and hypothesis\ntesting is necessary to understand how user trust in a visual analytics system\nevolves over its lifecycle, and that the analyst's selection of visualization\nparameters affords us a simple means to capture the interactions between\nuncertainty and cognitive bias as a function of the attributes of the search\ntasks the analyst executes while evaluating explanations.

    "abstract": "In real-world optimization scenarios, the problem instance that we are asked\nto solve may change during the optimization process, e.g., when new information\nbecomes available or when the environmental conditions change. In such\nsituations, one could hope to achieve reasonable performance by continuing the\nsearch from the best solution found for the original problem. Likewise, one may\nhope that when solving several problem instances that are similar to each\nother, it can be beneficial to ``warm-start'' the optimization process of the\nsecond instance by the best solution found for the first. However, it was shown\nin [Doerr et al., GECCO 2019] that even when initialized with structurally good\nsolutions, evolutionary algorithms can have a tendency to replace these good\nsolutions by structurally worse ones, resulting in optimization times that have\nno advantage over the same algorithms started from scratch. Doerr et al. also\nproposed a diversity mechanism to overcome this problem. Their approach\nbalances greedy search around a best-so-far solution for the current problem\nwith search in the neighborhood around the best-found solution for the previous\ninstance.\nIn this work, we first show that the re-optimization approach suggested by\nDoerr et al. reaches a limit when the problem instances are prone to more\nfrequent changes. More precisely, we show that they get stuck on the dynamic\nLeadingOnes problem in which the target string changes periodically. We then\npropose a modification of their algorithm which interpolates between greedy\nsearch around the previous-best and the current-best solution. We empirically\nevaluate our smoothed re-optimization algorithm on LeadingOnes instances with\nvarious frequencies of change and with different perturbation factors and show\nthat it outperforms both a fully restarted (1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm and the\nre-optimization approach by Doerr et al.",

    "abstract": "To address computational challenges associated with power flow\nnonconvexities, significant research efforts over the last decade have\ndeveloped convex relaxations and approximations of optimal power flow (OPF)\nproblems. However, benefits associated with the convexity of these relaxations\nand approximations can have tradeoffs in terms of solution accuracy since they\nmay yield voltage phasors that are inconsistent with the power injections and\nline flows, limiting their usefulness for some applications. Inspired by state\nestimation (SE) techniques, this paper proposes a new method for obtaining an\nAC power flow feasible point from the solution to a relaxed or approximated\noptimal power flow (OPF) problem. By treating the inconsistent voltage phasors,\npower injections, and line flows analogously to noisy measurements in a state\nestimation algorithm, the proposed method yields power injections and voltage\nphasors that are feasible with respect to the AC power flow equations while\nincorporating information from many quantities in the solution to a relaxed or\napproximated OPF problem. We improve this method by adjusting weighting terms\nwith a machine learning based approach. We demonstrate the proposed method\nusing several relaxations and approximations.

In this paper,\nwe shall propose a decentralized blockchain based FL (B-FL) architecture by\nusing a secure global aggregation algorithm to resist malicious devices, and\ndeploying practical Byzantine fault tolerance consensus protocol with high\neffectiveness and low energy consumption among multiple edge servers to prevent\nmodel tampering from the malicious server. However, to implement B-FL system at\nthe network edge, multiple rounds of cross-validation in blockchain consensus\nprotocol will induce long training latency. We thus formulate a network\noptimization problem that jointly considers bandwidth and power allocation for\nthe minimization of long-term average training latency consisting of\nprogressive learning rounds. We further propose to transform the network\noptimization problem as a Markov decision process and leverage the deep\nreinforcement learning based algorithm to provide high system performance with\nlow computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that B-FL can\nresist malicious attacks from edge devices and servers, and the training\nlatency of B-FL can be significantly reduced by deep reinforcement learning\nbased algorithm compared with baseline algorithms.",

In\nthis paper, we propose a distributed group differentially private majority vote\nmechanism for the sign selection problem in a distributed setup. To achieve\nthis, we apply the iterative peeling to the stability function and use the\nexponential mechanism to recover the signs. As applications, we study the\nprivate sign selection for mean estimation and linear regression problems in\ndistributed systems. Our method recovers the support and signs with the optimal\nsignal-to-noise ratio as in the non-private scenario, which is better than\ncontemporary works of private variable selections.

    "abstract": "We investigate the problem of private read update write (PRUW) in relation to\nprivate federated submodel learning (FSL), where a machine learning model is\ndivided into multiple submodels based on the different types of data used to\ntrain the model. In PRUW, each user downloads the required submodel without\nrevealing its index in the reading phase, and uploads the updates of the\nsubmodel without revealing the submodel index or the values of the updates in\nthe writing phase. In this work, we first provide a basic communication\nefficient PRUW scheme, and study further means of reducing the communication\ncost via sparsification. Gradient sparsification is a widely used concept in\nlearning applications, where only a selected set of parameters is downloaded\nand updated, which significantly reduces the communication cost. In this paper,\nwe study how the concept of sparsification can be incorporated in private FSL\nwith the goal of reducing the communication cost, while guaranteeing\ninformation theoretic privacy of the updated submodel index as well as the\nvalues of the updates. To this end, we introduce two schemes: PRUW with top $r$\nsparsification and PRUW with random sparsification. The former communicates\nonly the most significant parameters/updates among the servers and the users,\nwhile the latter communicates a randomly selected set of parameters/updates.\nThe two proposed schemes introduce novel techniques such as parameter/update\n(noisy) permutations to handle the additional sources of information leakage in\nPRUW caused by sparsification. Both schemes result in significantly reduced\ncommunication costs compared to that of the basic (non-sparse) PRUW scheme.",

However, there is no single\navailable, and safe implant for daily life usage exists yet.

    "abstract": "This paper studies how RAID (redundant array of independent disks) could take\nfull advantage of modern SSDs (solid-state drives) with built-in transparent\ncompression. In current practice, RAID users are forced to choose a specific\nRAID level (e.g., RAID 10 or RAID 5) with a fixed storage cost vs. speed\nperformance trade-off. Commercial market is witnessing the emergence of a new\nfamily of SSDs that can internally perform hardware-based lossless compression\non each 4KB LBA (logical block address) block, transparent to host OS and user\napplications. Beyond straightforwardly reducing the RAID storage cost, such\nmodern SSDs make it possible to relieve RAID users from being locked into a\nfixed storage cost vs. speed performance trade-off. The key idea is simple:\nRAID systems opportunistically leverage higher-than-expected runtime user data\ncompressibility to enable dynamic RAID level conversion to improve the speed\nperformance without compromising the effective storage capacity. This paper\npresents design techniques to enable and optimize the practical implementation\nof such elastic RAID systems. For the purpose of demonstration, we implemented\na Linux software-based elastic RAID prototype that supports dynamic conversion\nbetween RAID 5 and RAID 10. Compared with a baseline software-based RAID 5,\nunder sufficient runtime data compressibility that enables the conversion from\nRAID 5 to RAID 10 over 60% user data, the elastic RAID could improve the 4KB\nrandom write IOPS (IO per second) by 42% and 4KB random read IOPS in degraded\nmode by 46%, while maintaining the same effective storage capacity.",

In this work we carefully define the notion of functional\ndimension, show that it is inhomogeneous across the parameter space of ReLU\nneural network functions, and continue an investigation - initiated in [14] and\n[5] - into when the functional dimension achieves its theoretical maximum. We\nalso study the quotient space and fibers of the realization map from parameter\nspace to function space, supplying examples of fibers that are disconnected,\nfibers upon which functional dimension is non-constant, and fibers upon which\nthe symmetry group acts non-transitively.",

    "title": "Studying Drowsiness Detection Performance while Driving through Scalable  Machine Learning Models using Electroencephalography",
    "abstract": "Drowsiness is a major concern for drivers and one of the leading causes of\ntraffic accidents. Advances in Cognitive Neuroscience and Computer Science have\nenabled the detection of drivers' drowsiness by using Brain-Computer Interfaces\n(BCIs) and Machine Learning (ML). Nevertheless, several challenges remain open\nand should be faced. First, a comprehensive enough evaluation of drowsiness\ndetection performance using a heterogeneous set of ML algorithms is missing in\nthe literature. Last, it is needed to study the detection performance of\nscalable ML models suitable for groups of subjects and compare it with the\nindividual models proposed in the literature. To improve these limitations,\nthis work presents an intelligent framework that employs BCIs and features\nbased on electroencephalography (EEG) for detecting drowsiness in driving\nscenarios. The SEED-VIG dataset is used to feed different ML regressors and\nthree-class classifiers and then evaluate, analyze, and compare the\nbest-performing models for individual subjects and groups of them. More in\ndetail, regarding individual models, Random Forest (RF) obtained a 78%\nf1-score, improving the 58% obtained by models used in the literature such as\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM). Concerning scalable models, RF reached a 79%\nf1-score, demonstrating the effectiveness of these approaches. The lessons\nlearned can be summarized as follows: i) not only SVM but also other models not\nsufficiently explored in the literature are relevant for drowsiness detection,\nand ii) scalable approaches suitable for groups of subjects are effective to\ndetect drowsiness, even when new subjects that are not included in the models\ntraining are evaluated.",

    "abstract": "Although recent advances in deep learning technology have boosted automatic\nspeech recognition (ASR) performance in the single-talker case, it remains\ndifficult to recognize multi-talker speech in which many voices overlap. One\nconventional approach to tackle this problem is to use a cascade of a speech\nseparation or target speech extraction front-end with an ASR back-end. However,\nthe extra computation costs of the front-end module are a critical barrier to\nquick response, especially for streaming ASR. In this paper, we propose a\ntarget-speaker ASR (TS-ASR) system that implicitly integrates the target speech\nextraction functionality within a streaming end-to-end (E2E) ASR system, i.e.\nrecurrent neural network-transducer (RNNT). Our system uses a similar idea as\nadopted for target speech extraction, but implements it directly at the level\nof the encoder of RNNT. This allows TS-ASR to be realized without placing extra\ncomputation costs on the front-end. Note that this study presents two major\ndifferences between prior studies on E2E TS-ASR; we investigate streaming\nmodels and base our study on Conformer models, whereas prior studies used\nRNN-based systems and considered only offline processing. We confirm in\nexperiments that our TS-ASR achieves comparable recognition performance with\nconventional cascade systems in the offline setting, while reducing computation\ncosts and realizing streaming TS-ASR.",

The analysis of such data has become more and more\nimportant due to the increase of availability in many industrial fields.\nLabeling, sorting or filtering highly transient measurement data for training\ncondition based maintenance (CbM) models is cumbersome and error-prone. For\nsome applications it can be sufficient to filter measurements by simple\nthresholds or finding change-points based on changes in mean value and\nvariation.

This paper addresses the issue of\nimproving the retinal image quality and vessel segmentation through retinal\nimage restoration. More specifically, a cycle-consistent generative adversarial\nnetwork (CycleGAN) with a convolution block attention module (CBAM) is used for\nretinal image restoration. A modified UNet is used for retinal vessel\nsegmentation for the restored retinal images (CBAM-UNet). The proposed model\nconsists of two generators and two discriminators. Generators translate images\nfrom one domain to another, i.e., from low to high quality and vice versa.\nDiscriminators classify generated and original images. The retinal vessel\nsegmentation model uses downsampling, bottlenecking, and upsampling layers to\ngenerate segmented images. The CBAM has been used to enhance the feature\nextraction of these models. The proposed method does not require paired image\ndatasets, which are challenging to produce. Instead, it uses unpaired data that\nconsists of low- and high-quality fundus images retrieved from publicly\navailable datasets. The restoration performance of the proposed method was\nevaluated using full-reference evaluation metrics, e.g., peak signal-to-noise\nratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM). The retinal vessel\nsegmentation performance was compared with the ground-truth fundus images. The\nproposed method can significantly reduce the degradation effects caused by\nout-of-focus blurring, color distortion, low, high, and uneven illumination.\nExperimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method for retinal\nimage restoration and vessel segmentation.",

    "title": "Longitudinal Acoustic Speech Tracking Following Pediatric Traumatic  Brain Injury",
    "abstract": "Recommendations for common outcome measures following pediatric traumatic\nbrain injury (TBI) support the integration of instrumental measurements\nalongside perceptual assessment in recovery and treatment plans. A\ncomprehensive set of sensitive, robust and non-invasive measurements is\ntherefore essential in assessing variations in speech characteristics over time\nfollowing pediatric TBI. In this article, we study the changes in the acoustic\nspeech patterns of a pediatric cohort of ten subjects diagnosed with severe\nTBI. We extract a diverse set of both well-known and novel acoustic features\nfrom child speech recorded throughout the year after the child produced\nintelligible words. These features are analyzed individually and by speech\nsubsystem, within-subject and across the cohort. As a group, older children\nexhibit highly significant (p<0.01) increases in pitch variation and phoneme\ndiversity, shortened pause length, and steadying articulation rate variability.\nYounger children exhibit similar steadied rate variability alongside an\nincrease in formant-based articulation complexity. Correlation analysis of the\nfeature set with age and comparisons to normative developmental data confirm\nthat age at injury plays a significant role in framing the recovery trajectory.\nNearly all speech features significantly change (p<0.05) for the cohort as a\nwhole, confirming that acoustic measures supplementing perceptual assessment\nare needed to identify efficacious treatment targets for speech therapy\nfollowing TBI.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the possibility of solving continuous non-convex optimization\nproblems using a network of interacting quantum optical oscillators. We propose\na native encoding of continuous variables in analog signals associated with the\nquadrature operators of a set of quantum optical modes. Optical coupling of the\nmodes and noise introduced by vacuum fluctuations from external reservoirs or\nby weak measurements of the modes are used to optically simulate a diffusion\nprocess on a set of continuous random variables. The process is run\nsufficiently long for it to relax into the steady state of an energy potential\ndefined on a continuous domain. As a first demonstration, we numerically\nbenchmark solving box-constrained quadratic programming (BoxQP) problems using\nthese settings. We consider delay-line and measurement-feedback variants of the\nexperiment. Our benchmarking results demonstrate that in both cases the optical\nnetwork is capable of solving BoxQP problems over three orders of magnitude\nfaster than a state-of-the-art classical heuristic.",

Modern radio telescopes such as SKA will be generating petabytes of\ndata in their full scale of operation. Hence experience-based and data-driven\nalgorithms become indispensable for applications such as candidate detection.\nHere we describe our findings from testing a state of the art object detection\nalgorithm called Mask R-CNN to detect candidate signatures in the SKA pulsar\nsearch pipeline. We have trained the Mask R-CNN model to detect candidate\nimages. A custom annotation tool was developed to mark the regions of interest\nin large datasets efficiently.
