Especially, we exploit the recently\nreleased Ego4D dataset \\cite{grauman2021ego4d} to pioneer Egocentric VLP from\npretraining dataset, pretraining objective, and development set. Based on the\nabove three designs, we develop a pretrained video-language model that is able\nto transfer its egocentric video-text representation or video-only\nrepresentation to several video downstream tasks. Our Egocentric VLP achieves\n10.46R@1&IoU @0.3 on NLQ, 10.33 mAP on MQ, 74% Acc on OSCC, 0.67 sec error on\nPNR. The code is available at https://github.com/showlab/EgoVLP.",

    "title": "Stochastic Restoration of Heavily Compressed Musical Audio using  Generative Adversarial Networks",
    "abstract": "Lossy audio codecs compress (and decompress) digital audio streams by\nremoving information that tends to be inaudible in human perception. Under high\ncompression rates, such codecs may introduce a variety of impairments in the\naudio signal. Many works have tackled the problem of audio enhancement and\ncompression artifact removal using deep learning techniques. However, only a\nfew works tackle the restoration of heavily compressed audio signals in the\nmusical domain. In such a scenario, there is no unique solution for the\nrestoration of the original signal. Therefore, in this study, we test a\nstochastic generator of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture for\nthis task. Such a stochastic generator, conditioned on highly compressed\nmusical audio signals, could one day generate outputs indistinguishable from\nhigh-quality releases. Therefore, the present study may yield insights into\nmore efficient musical data storage and transmission. We train stochastic and\ndeterministic generators on MP3-compressed audio signals with 16, 32, and 64\nkbit/s. We perform an extensive evaluation of the different experiments\nutilizing objective metrics and listening tests. We find that the models can\nimprove the quality of the audio signals over the MP3 versions for 16 and 32\nkbit/s and that the stochastic generators are capable of generating outputs\nthat are closer to the original signals than those of the deterministic\ngenerators.",

    "abstract": "A continuous goal in all communication systems is to enhance the users\nexperience and provide them with the highest possible data rates. Recently, the\nconcept of cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) systems has been considered to\nenhance the performance of systems that operate merely with Radio Frequency\n(RF) or visible light communication (VLC) technologies. In this paper, a hybrid\nVLC/RF cell-free massive MIMO system is proposed where an RF cell-free network\nand a VLC cell-free network coexist to serve users. The idea is to utilize the\nbenefits of each network and balance the load aiming at maximizing the system's\nsum-rate. The system is evaluated using zero-forcing (ZF) precoding scheme. Two\nuser association algorithms are proposed to assign users to either the VLC or\nthe RF networks. In addition, two user-centric clustering approaches are\nproposed and evaluated. Simulation results show that the proposed association\nalgorithms significantly outperform a random network association of users in\nterms of sum-rate. Results also show great potential for the proposed system\ncompared to standalone cell-free networks.",

Geoparsing refers to the process of recognizing\nlocation references from texts and identifying their geospatial\nrepresentations. While geoparsing can benefit many domains, a summary of the\nspecific applications is still missing. Further, there lacks a comprehensive\nreview and comparison of existing approaches for location reference\nrecognition, which is the first and a core step of geoparsing. To fill these\nresearch gaps, this review first summarizes seven typical application domains\nof geoparsing: geographic information retrieval, disaster management, disease\nsurveillance, traffic management, spatial humanities, tourism management, and\ncrime management. We then review existing approaches for location reference\nrecognition by categorizing these approaches into four groups based on their\nunderlying functional principle: rule-based, gazetteer matching-based,\nstatistical learning-based, and hybrid approaches. Next, we thoroughly evaluate\nthe correctness and computational efficiency of the 27 most widely used\napproaches for location reference recognition based on 26 public datasets with\ndifferent types of texts (e.g., social media posts and news stories) containing\n39,736 location references across the world.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of automatically detecting and quantifying\nperformance degradation in remote mobile robots during task execution. A robot\nmay encounter a variety of uncertainties and adversities during task execution,\nwhich can impair its ability to carry out tasks effectively and cause its\nperformance to degrade. Such situations can be mitigated or averted by timely\ndetection and intervention (e.g., by a remote human supervisor taking over\ncontrol in teleoperation mode). Inspired by patient triaging systems in\nhospitals, we introduce the framework of \"robot vitals\" for estimating overall\n\"robot health\". A robot's vitals are a set of indicators that estimate the\nextent of performance degradation faced by a robot at a given point in time.\nRobot health is a metric that combines robot vitals into a single scalar value\nestimate of performance degradation. Experiments, both in simulation and on a\nreal mobile robot, demonstrate that the proposed robot vitals and robot health\ncan be used effectively to estimate robot performance degradation during\nruntime.",

Most of the\nexisting works do not focus on generating and predicting the reaction and\ncannot generate the motion when only the action is given as input. To address\nthis limitation, we propose a novel interaction Transformer (InterFormer)\nconsisting of a Transformer network with both temporal and spatial attentions.\nSpecifically, the temporal attention captures the temporal dependencies of the\nmotion of both characters and of their interaction, while the spatial attention\nlearns the dependencies between the different body parts of each character and\nthose which are part of the interaction. Moreover, we propose using graphs to\nincrease the performance of the spatial attention via an interaction distance\nmodule that helps focus on nearby joints from both characters. Extensive\nexperiments on the SBU interaction, K3HI, and DuetDance datasets demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of InterFormer. Our method is general and can be used to\ngenerate more complex and long-term interactions.",

    "abstract": "Topologically interlocked structures are architectured by fitting together\nblocks that are constrained geometrically through contact and friction by their\nneighboring blocks. As long as the frictional strength is nowhere exceeded, the\nblocks stick against each other, allowing for large rotations. Once the\ninterfacial stresses exceed the frictional strength, relative sliding between\nthe blocks alters the structure's mechanical response. Improving the structural\nperformance, precisely the strength and the toughness, has been one of the main\nfocal points in the literature. However, many fundamental questions regarding\nthe role and effect of the interface mechanisms (stick and slip) and rotation\nof the blocks have not been addressed yet. Here, we carry out a parametric\nanalysis to understand the effect of Young's modulus, friction coefficient and\ngeometry of the blocks on the dominance of the stick or slip governed\nmechanism. We combine analytical and computational tools to analyze the failure\nmechanisms and the response capacities of beam-like topologically interlocked\nstructures. This is achieved using a finite element method coupled with a\npenalty-based approach for enforcing contact constraints along interfaces. We\nshow that the combination of the structure's height and the friction\ncoefficient controls whether the failure mechanism is slip-governed or\nstick-governed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the sticking mechanism across\nall interfaces along with the rotation of the blocks dictates a saturation\nlevel to the mechanical performance of a given structure irrespective of\ngeometric and material properties. This provides a theoretical upper bound for\nthe structural response of topologically interlocked structures, and\nestablishes a benchmark of achievable performance under idealistic conditions.",

    "abstract": "Inspired by the strong ties between vision and language, the two intimate\nhuman sensing and communication modalities, our paper aims to explore the\ngeneration of 3D human full-body motions from texts, as well as its reciprocal\ntask, shorthanded for text2motion and motion2text, respectively. To tackle the\nexisting challenges, especially to enable the generation of multiple distinct\nmotions from the same text, and to avoid the undesirable production of trivial\nmotionless pose sequences, we propose the use of motion token, a discrete and\ncompact motion representation. This provides one level playing ground when\nconsidering both motions and text signals, as the motion and text tokens,\nrespectively. Moreover, our motion2text module is integrated into the inverse\nalignment process of our text2motion training pipeline, where a significant\ndeviation of synthesized text from the input text would be penalized by a large\ntraining loss; empirically this is shown to effectively improve performance.\nFinally, the mappings in-between the two modalities of motions and texts are\nfacilitated by adapting the neural model for machine translation (NMT) to our\ncontext. This autoregressive modeling of the distribution over discrete motion\ntokens further enables non-deterministic production of pose sequences, of\nvariable lengths, from an input text. Our approach is flexible, could be used\nfor both text2motion and motion2text tasks. Empirical evaluations on two\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our approach on both\ntasks over a variety of state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "In the past two decades, several Machine Learning (ML) libraries have become\nfreely available. Many studies have used such libraries to carry out empirical\ninvestigations on predictive Software Engineering (SE) tasks. However, the\ndifferences stemming from using one library over another have been overlooked,\nimplicitly assuming that using any of these libraries would provide the user\nwith the same or very similar results. This paper aims at raising awareness of\nthe differences incurred when using different ML libraries for software\ndevelopment effort estimation (SEE), one of most widely studied SE prediction\ntasks. To this end, we investigate 4 deterministic machine learners as provided\nby 3 of the most popular ML open-source libraries written in different\nlanguages (namely, Scikit-Learn, Caret and Weka). We carry out a thorough\nempirical study comparing the performance of the machine learners on 5 SEE\ndatasets in the two most common SEE scenarios (i.e., out-of-the-box-ml and\ntuned-ml) as well as an in-depth analysis of the documentation and code of\ntheir APIs. The results of our study reveal that the predictions provided by\nthe 3 libraries differ in 95% of the cases on average across a total of 105\ncases studied. These differences are significantly large in most cases and\nyield misestimations of up to approx. 3,000 hours per project. Moreover, our\nAPI analysis reveals that these libraries provide the user with different\nlevels of control on the parameters one can manipulate, and a lack of clarity\nand consistency, overall, which might mislead users. Our findings highlight\nthat the ML library is an important design choice for SEE studies, which can\nlead to a difference in performance. However, such a difference is\nunder-documented. We conclude by highlighting open-challenges with suggestions\nfor the developers of libraries as well as for the researchers and\npractitioners using them.",

Moreover, a dynamic\nadaptation is required for the Time-to-Trigger (TTT) and hysteresis margin,\nwhich significantly impact the handover latency and overall throughput.\nTherefore, in this paper, we propose an online learning-based mechanism, known\nas Learning-based Intelligent Mobility Management (LIM2), for mobility\nmanagement in 5G and beyond, with an intelligent adaptation of the TTT and\nhysteresis values. LIM2 uses a Kalman filter to predict the future signal\nquality of the serving and neighbor cells, selects the target cell for the\nhandover using state-action-reward-state-action (SARSA)-based reinforcement\nlearning, and adapts the TTT and hysteresis using the epsilon-greedy policy. We\nimplement a prototype of the LIM2 in NS-3 and extensively analyze its\nperformance, where it is observed that the LIM2 algorithm can significantly\nimprove the handover operation in very high speed mobility scenarios.",

    "title": "Disentangled Action Recognition with Knowledge Bases",
    "abstract": "Action in video usually involves the interaction of human with objects.\nAction labels are typically composed of various combinations of verbs and\nnouns, but we may not have training data for all possible combinations. In this\npaper, we aim to improve the generalization ability of the compositional action\nrecognition model to novel verbs or novel nouns that are unseen during training\ntime, by leveraging the power of knowledge graphs. Previous work utilizes\nverb-noun compositional action nodes in the knowledge graph, making it\ninefficient to scale since the number of compositional action nodes grows\nquadratically with respect to the number of verbs and nouns. To address this\nissue, we propose our approach: Disentangled Action Recognition with\nKnowledge-bases (DARK), which leverages the inherent compositionality of\nactions. DARK trains a factorized model by first extracting disentangled\nfeature representations for verbs and nouns, and then predicting classification\nweights using relations in external knowledge graphs. The type constraint\nbetween verb and noun is extracted from external knowledge bases and finally\napplied when composing actions. DARK has better scalability in the number of\nobjects and verbs, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Charades\ndataset. We further propose a new benchmark split based on the Epic-kitchen\ndataset which is an order of magnitude bigger in the numbers of classes and\nsamples, and benchmark various models on this benchmark.",

    "abstract": "Recent research in the social sciences has identified situations in which\nsmall changes in the way that information is provided to consumers can have\nlarge aggregate effects on behavior. This has been promoted in popular media in\nareas of public health and wellness, but its application to other areas has not\nbeen broadly studied. This paper presents a simple model which expresses the\neffect of providing commuters with carefully-curated information regarding\naggregate traffic \"slowdowns\" on the various roads in a transportation network.\nMuch of the work on providing information to commuters focuses specifically on\ntravel-time information. However, the model in the present paper allows a\nsystem planner to provide slowdown information as well; that is, commuters are\nadditionally told how much slower each route is as compared to its uncongested\nstate. We show that providing this additional information can improve\nequilibrium routing efficiency when compared to the case when commuters are\nonly given information about travel time, but that these improvements in\ncongestion are not universal. That is, transportation networks exist on which\nany provision of slowdown information can harm equilibrium congestion. In\naddition, this paper illuminates a deep connection between the effects of\ncommuter slowdown-sensitivity and the study of marginal-cost pricing and\naltruism in congestion games.",

In real-world applications, however, a trained FG-SBIR model is\noften applied to both new categories and different human sketchers, i.e.,\ndifferent drawing styles. Although this complicates the generalisation problem,\nfortunately, a handful of examples are typically available, enabling the model\nto adapt to the new category/style. In this paper, we offer a novel perspective\n-- instead of asking for a model that generalises, we advocate for one that\nquickly adapts, with just very few samples during testing (in a few-shot\nmanner). To solve this new problem, we introduce a novel model-agnostic\nmeta-learning (MAML) based framework with several key modifications: (1) As a\nretrieval task with a margin-based contrastive loss, we simplify the MAML\ntraining in the inner loop to make it more stable and tractable. (2) The margin\nin our contrastive loss is also meta-learned with the rest of the model.

    "abstract": "Mobile devices and the immense amount and variety of data they generate are\nkey enablers of machine learning (ML)-based applications. Traditional ML\ntechniques have shifted toward new paradigms such as federated (FL) and split\nlearning (SL) to improve the protection of user's data privacy. However, these\nparadigms often rely on server(s) located in the edge or cloud to train\ncomputationally-heavy parts of a ML model to avoid draining the limited\nresource on client devices, resulting in exposing device data to such third\nparties. This work proposes an alternative approach to train\ncomputationally-heavy ML models in user's devices themselves, where\ncorresponding device data resides. Specifically, we focus on GANs (generative\nadversarial networks) and leverage their inherent privacy-preserving attribute.\nWe train the discriminative part of a GAN with raw data on user's devices,\nwhereas the generative model is trained remotely (e.g., server) for which there\nis no need to access sensor true data. Moreover, our approach ensures that the\ncomputational load of training the discriminative model is shared among user's\ndevices-proportional to their computation capabilities-by means of SL. We\nimplement our proposed collaborative training scheme of a computationally-heavy\nGAN model in real resource-constrained devices.

However, the limitations\nof computing resources, battery capacity, and maximum load of UAV hinder the\ndeployment of deep learning-based tracking algorithms on UAV. Consequently,\ndiscriminative correlation filters (DCF) trackers stand out in the UAV tracking\ncommunity because of their high efficiency. However, their precision is usually\nmuch lower than trackers based on deep learning. Model compression is a\npromising way to narrow the gap (i.e., effciency, precision) between DCF- and\ndeep learning- based trackers, which has not caught much attention in UAV\ntracking. In this paper, we propose the P-SiamFC++ tracker, which is the first\nto use rank-based filter pruning to compress the SiamFC++ model, achieving a\nremarkable balance between efficiency and precision. Our method is general and\nmay encourage further studies on UAV tracking with model compression.

    "abstract": "High-quality saliency maps are essential in several machine learning\napplication areas including explainable AI and weakly supervised object\ndetection and segmentation. Many techniques have been developed to generate\nbetter saliency using neural networks. However, they are often limited to\nspecific saliency visualisation methods or saliency issues. We propose a novel\nsaliency enhancing approach called SESS (Saliency Enhancing with Scaling and\nSliding). It is a method and model agnostic extension to existing saliency map\ngeneration methods. With SESS, existing saliency approaches become robust to\nscale variance, multiple occurrences of target objects, presence of distractors\nand generate less noisy and more discriminative saliency maps. SESS improves\nsaliency by fusing saliency maps extracted from multiple patches at different\nscales from different areas, and combines these individual maps using a novel\nfusion scheme that incorporates channel-wise weights and spatial weighted\naverage. To improve efficiency, we introduce a pre-filtering step that can\nexclude uninformative saliency maps to improve efficiency while still enhancing\noverall results. We evaluate SESS on object recognition and detection\nbenchmarks where it achieves significant improvement.

Recent studies achieved success in\ncircumventing the curse of dimensionality in solving such PDEs with underlying\napplications to human-robot interactions (HRI), by adopting self-supervised\n(physics-informed) neural networks as universal value approximators. This paper\nextends from previous SOTA on zero-sum games with continuous values to\ngeneral-sum games with discontinuous values, where the discontinuity is caused\nby that of the players' losses. We show that due to its lack of convergence\nproof and generalization analysis on discontinuous losses, the existing\nself-supervised learning technique fails to generalize and raises safety\nconcerns in an autonomous driving application. Our solution is to first\npre-train the value network on supervised Nash equilibria, and then refine it\nby minimizing a loss that combines the supervised data with the PDE and\nboundary conditions. Importantly, the demonstrated advantage of the proposed\nlearning method against purely supervised and self-supervised approaches\nrequires careful choice of the neural activation function: Among\n$\\texttt{relu}$, $\\texttt{sin}$, and $\\texttt{tanh}$, we show that\n$\\texttt{tanh}$ is the only choice that achieves optimal generalization and\nsafety performance.

Further, the OOI are often small and occupy\nless than 1% of image area, are occluded, and co-exist with many semantically\ndifferent objects in cluttered scenes.

We propose a multi-layer transformer-based\nframework that involves geometric and relational reasoning between parts to\nupdate the part poses iteratively. We carefully design a unique instance\nencoding to solve the ambiguity between geometrically-similar parts so that all\nparts can be distinguished. In addition to assembling from scratch, we extend\nour framework to a new task called in-process part assembly. Analogous to\nfurniture maintenance, it requires robots to continue with unfinished products\nand assemble the remaining parts into appropriate positions. Our method\nachieves far more than 10% improvements over the current state-of-the-art in\nmultiple metrics on the public PartNet dataset.

    "abstract": "Program synthesis or code generation aims to generate a program that\nsatisfies a problem specification. Recent approaches using large-scale\npretrained language models (LMs) have shown promising results, yet they have\nsome critical limitations. In particular, they often follow a standard\nsupervised fine-tuning procedure to train a code generation model only from the\npairs of natural-language problem descriptions and ground-truth programs. Such\nparadigm largely ignores some important but potentially useful signals in the\nproblem specification such as unit tests, which thus often results in poor\nperformance when solving complex unseen coding tasks. To address the\nlimitations, we propose \"CodeRL\", a new framework for program synthesis tasks\nthrough pretrained LMs and deep reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically,\nduring training, we treat the code-generating LM as an actor network, and\nintroduce a critic network that is trained to predict the functional\ncorrectness of generated programs and provide dense feedback signals to the\nactor. During inference, we introduce a new generation procedure with a\ncritical sampling strategy that allows a model to automatically regenerate\nprograms based on feedback from example unit tests and critic scores. For the\nmodel backbones, we extended the encoder-decoder architecture of CodeT5 with\nenhanced learning objectives, larger model sizes, and better pretraining data.\nOur method not only achieves new SOTA results on the challenging APPS\nbenchmark, but also shows strong zero-shot transfer capability with new SOTA\nresults on the simpler MBPP benchmark.",

    "abstract": "Transfer learning refers to the transfer of knowledge or information from a\nrelevant source task to a target task. However, most existing works assume both\ntasks are sampled from a stationary task distribution, thereby leading to the\nsub-optimal performance for dynamic tasks drawn from a non-stationary task\ndistribution in real scenarios. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we study a\nmore realistic and challenging transfer learning setting with dynamic tasks,\ni.e., source and target tasks are continuously evolving over time. We\ntheoretically show that the expected error on the dynamic target task can be\ntightly bounded in terms of source knowledge and consecutive distribution\ndiscrepancy across tasks. This result motivates us to propose a generic\nmeta-learning framework L2E for modeling the knowledge transferability on\ndynamic tasks. It is centered around a task-guided meta-learning problem with a\ngroup of meta-pairs of tasks, based on which we are able to learn the prior\nmodel initialization for fast adaptation on the newest target task. L2E enjoys\nthe following properties: (1) effective knowledge transferability across\ndynamic tasks; (2) fast adaptation to the new target task; (3) mitigation of\ncatastrophic forgetting on historical target tasks; and (4) flexibility in\nincorporating any existing static transfer learning algorithms. Extensive\nexperiments on various image data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed L2E framework.",

    "abstract": "The prosperity of decentralized finance motivates many investors to profit\nvia trading their crypto assets on decentralized applications (DApps for short)\nof the Ethereum ecosystem. Apart from Ether (the native cryptocurrency of\nEthereum), many ERC20 (a widely used token standard on Ethereum) tokens obtain\nvast market value in the ecosystem. Specifically, the approval mechanism is\nused to delegate the privilege of spending users' tokens to DApps. By doing so,\nthe DApps can transfer these tokens to arbitrary receivers on behalf of the\nusers. To increase the usability, unlimited approval is commonly adopted by\nDApps to reduce the required interaction between them and their users. However,\nas shown in existing security incidents, this mechanism can be abused to steal\nusers' tokens.\nIn this paper, we present the first systematic study to quantify the risk of\nunlimited approval of ERC20 tokens on Ethereum. Specifically, by evaluating\nexisting transactions up to 31st July 2021, we find that unlimited approval is\nprevalent (60%, 15.2M/25.4M) in the ecosystem, and 22% of users have a high\nrisk of their approved tokens for stealing. After that, we investigate the\nsecurity issues that are involved in interacting with the UIs of 22\nrepresentative DApps and 9 famous wallets to prepare the approval transactions.\nThe result reveals the worrisome fact that all DApps request unlimited approval\nfrom the front-end users and only 10% (3/31) of UIs provide explanatory\ninformation for the approval mechanism. Meanwhile, only 16% (5/31) of UIs allow\nusers to modify their approval amounts. Finally, we take a further step to\ncharacterize the user behavior into five modes and formalize the good practice,\ni.e., on-demand approval and timely spending, towards securely spending\napproved tokens. However, the evaluation result suggests that only 0.2% of\nusers follow the good practice to mitigate the risk.",

In our work, we develop deep networks\nto further improve the quantitative and the perceptual quality of\nreconstruction.

Secondly, we improve the structure recovery of DC-RSN for T2\nweighted Imaging (T2WI) through assistance of T1 weighted imaging (T1WI), a\nsequence with short acquisition time. T1 assistance is provided to DC-RSN\nthrough a gradient of log feature (GOLF) fusion.

It is a promising solution to take the advantage of generative models\nto hallucinate realistic unseen samples based on the knowledge learned from the\nseen classes. However, due to the generation shifts, the synthesized samples by\nmost existing methods may drift from the real distribution of the unseen data.\nTo address this issue, we propose a novel flow-based generative framework that\nconsists of multiple conditional affine coupling layers for learning unseen\ndata generation. Specifically, we discover and address three potential problems\nthat trigger the generation shifts, i.e., semantic inconsistency, variance\ncollapse, and structure disorder. First, to enhance the reflection of the\nsemantic information in the generated samples, we explicitly embed the semantic\ninformation into the transformation in each conditional affine coupling layer.\nSecond, to recover the intrinsic variance of the real unseen features, we\nintroduce a boundary sample mining strategy with entropy maximization to\ndiscover more difficult visual variants of semantic prototypes and hereby\nadjust the decision boundary of the classifiers. Third, a relative positioning\nstrategy is proposed to revise the attribute embeddings, guiding them to fully\npreserve the inter-class geometric structure and further avoid structure\ndisorder in the semantic space.

    "abstract": "Whole slide image (WSI) classification often relies on deep weakly supervised\nmultiple instance learning (MIL) methods to handle gigapixel resolution images\nand slide-level labels. Yet the decent performance of deep learning comes from\nharnessing massive datasets and diverse samples, urging the need for efficient\ntraining pipelines for scaling to large datasets and data augmentation\ntechniques for diversifying samples. However, current MIL-based WSI\nclassification pipelines are memory-expensive and computation-inefficient since\nthey usually assemble tens of thousands of patches as bags for computation. On\nthe other hand, despite their popularity in other tasks, data augmentations are\nunexplored for WSI MIL frameworks. To address them, we propose ReMix, a general\nand efficient framework for MIL based WSI classification. It comprises two\nsteps: reduce and mix. First, it reduces the number of instances in WSI bags by\nsubstituting instances with instance prototypes, i.e., patch cluster centroids.\nThen, we propose a ``Mix-the-bag'' augmentation that contains four online,\nstochastic and flexible latent space augmentations. It brings diverse and\nreliable class-identity-preserving semantic changes in the latent space while\nenforcing semantic-perturbation invariance. We evaluate ReMix on two public\ndatasets with two state-of-the-art MIL methods.

    "title": "Aesthetic Attribute Assessment of Images Numerically on Mixed  Multi-attribute Datasets",
    "abstract": "With the continuous development of social software and multimedia technology,\nimages have become a kind of important carrier for spreading information and\nsocializing. How to evaluate an image comprehensively has become the focus of\nrecent researches. The traditional image aesthetic assessment methods often\nadopt single numerical overall assessment scores, which has certain\nsubjectivity and can no longer meet the higher aesthetic requirements. In this\npaper, we construct an new image attribute dataset called aesthetic mixed\ndataset with attributes(AMD-A) and design external attribute features for\nfusion. Besides, we propose a efficient method for image aesthetic attribute\nassessment on mixed multi-attribute dataset and construct a multitasking\nnetwork architecture by using the EfficientNet-B0 as the backbone network. Our\nmodel can achieve aesthetic classification, overall scoring and attribute\nscoring. In each sub-network, we improve the feature extraction through ECA\nchannel attention module. As for the final overall scoring, we adopt the idea\nof the teacher-student network and use the classification sub-network to guide\nthe aesthetic overall fine-grain regression. Experimental results, using the\nMindSpore, show that our proposed method can effectively improve the\nperformance of the aesthetic overall and attribute assessment.",

    "title": "Complexity Analysis of the SAT Attack on Logic Locking",
    "abstract": "Due to the adoption of horizontal business models following the globalization\nof semiconductor manufacturing, the overproduction of integrated circuits (ICs)\nand the piracy of intellectual properties (IPs) can lead to significant damage\nto the integrity of the semiconductor supply chain. Logic locking emerges as a\nprimary design-for-security measure to counter these threats, where ICs become\nfully functional only when unlocked with a secret key. However, Boolean\nsatisfiability-based attacks have rendered most locking schemes ineffective.\nThis gives rise to numerous defenses and new locking methods to achieve SAT\nresiliency. This paper provides a unique perspective on the SAT attack\nefficiency based on conjunctive normal form (CNF) stored in SAT solver. First,\nwe show how the attack learns new relations between keys in every iteration\nusing distinguishing input patterns and the corresponding oracle responses. The\ninput-output pairs result in new CNF clauses of unknown keys to be appended to\nthe SAT solver, which leads to an exponential reduction in incorrect key\nvalues. Second, we demonstrate that the SAT attack can break any locking scheme\nwithin linear iteration complexity of key size. Moreover, we show how key\nconstraints on point functions affect the SAT attack complexity. We explain why\nproper key constraint on AntiSAT reduces the complexity effectively to constant\n1. The same constraint helps the breaking of CAS-Lock down to linear iteration\ncomplexity. Our analysis provides a new perspective on the capabilities of SAT\nattack against multiplier benchmark c6288, and we provide new directions to\nachieve SAT resiliency.",

However, there are two underlying limitations in generic video\nsummarization task. First, most previous approaches read in just visual\nfeatures as input, leaving other modality features behind. Second, existing\ndatasets for generic video summarization are relatively insufficient to train a\ncaption generator and multimodal feature extractors. To address these two\nproblems, this paper proposes the Multimodal Frame-Scoring Transformer (MFST)\nframework exploiting visual, text and audio features and scoring a video with\nrespect to frames. Our MFST framework first extracts each modality features\n(visual-text-audio) using pretrained encoders.

In this study, Carleman linearization was utilized\nto transform nonlinear first-order ODEs of chemical reactions into linear ODEs.\nAlthough this linearization theoretically requires the generation of an\ninfinite matrix, the original nonlinear equations can be reconstructed. For the\npractical use, the linearized system should be truncated with finite size and\nanalysis precision can be determined by the extent of the truncation.

Our method was applied to a one-variable nonlinear dy/dt =\n-y^2 system to investigate the effect of truncation orders in Carleman\nlinearization and time step size on the absolute error.

    "abstract": "Recent progress on 3D scene understanding has explored visual grounding\n(3DVG) to localize a target object through a language description. However,\nexisting methods only consider the dependency between the entire sentence and\nthe target object, thus ignoring fine-grained relationships between contexts\nand non-target ones. In this paper, we extend 3DVG to a more reliable and\nexplainable task, called 3D Phrase Aware Grounding (3DPAG). The 3DPAG task aims\nto localize the target object in the 3D scenes by explicitly identifying all\nphrase-related objects and then conducting reasoning according to contextual\nphrases. To tackle this problem, we label about 400K phrase-level annotations\nfrom 170K sentences in available 3DVG datasets, i.e., Nr3D, Sr3D and ScanRefer.\nBy tapping on these developed datasets, we propose a novel framework, i.e.,\nPhraseRefer, which conducts phrase-aware and object-level representation\nlearning through phrase-object alignment optimization as well as\nphrase-specific pre-training. In our setting, we extend previous 3DVG methods\nto the phrase-aware scenario and provide metrics to measure the explainability\nof the 3DPAG task. Extensive results confirm that 3DPAG effectively boosts the\n3DVG, and PhraseRefer achieves state-of-the-arts across three datasets, i.e.,\n63.0%, 54.4% and 55.5% overall accuracy on Sr3D, Nr3D and ScanRefer,\nrespectively.",

Feature selection is often used\nto identify the important features but can produce unstable results when\napplied to high-dimensional data, selecting a different set of features on each\niteration.\nThe stability of feature selection can be improved with the use of feature\nselection ensembles, which aggregate the results of multiple base feature\nselectors. A threshold must be applied to the final aggregated feature set to\nseparate the relevant features from the redundant ones. A fixed threshold,\nwhich is typically applied, offers no guarantee that the final set of selected\nfeatures contains only relevant features. This work develops several\ndata-driven thresholds to automatically identify the relevant features in an\nensemble feature selector and evaluates their predictive accuracy and\nstability.\nTo demonstrate the applicability of these methods to clinical data, they are\napplied to data from two real-world Alzheimer's disease (AD) studies. AD is a\nprogressive neurodegenerative disease with no known cure, that begins at least\n2-3 decades before overt symptoms appear, presenting an opportunity for\nresearchers to identify early biomarkers that might identify patients at risk\nof developing AD.

Although the\nchallenges of adapting new voices in zero-shot scenario exist in both stages --\nacoustic modeling and vocoder, previous works usually consider the problem from\nonly one stage. In this paper, we extend our previous Glow-WaveGAN to\nGlow-WaveGAN 2, aiming to solve the problem from both stages for high-quality\nzero-shot text-to-speech and any-to-any voice conversion. We first build a\nuniversal WaveGAN model for extracting latent distribution $p(z)$ of speech and\nreconstructing waveform from it. Then a flow-based acoustic model only needs to\nlearn the same $p(z)$ from texts, which naturally avoids the mismatch between\nthe acoustic model and the vocoder, resulting in high-quality generated speech\nwithout model fine-tuning. Based on a continuous speaker space and the\nreversible property of flows, the conditional distribution can be obtained for\nany speaker, and thus we can further conduct high-quality zero-shot speech\ngeneration for new speakers. We particularly investigate two methods to\nconstruct the speaker space, namely pre-trained speaker encoder and\njointly-trained speaker encoder.

Especially when a new\nvulnerability (or a privacy-invasive behavior) was discovered in a third-party\nlibrary, there is a practical need to precisely identify the existence of\nlibraries and their versions for iOS apps. However, few studies have been\nproposed to tackle this problem, and they all suffer from the code duplication\nproblem in different libraries. In this paper, we focus on third-party library\ndetection in iOS apps. Given an app, we aim to identify the integrated\nlibraries and pinpoint their versions (or the version range).To this end, we\nfirst conduct an in-depth study on iOS third-party libraries to demystify the\ncode duplication challenge. By doing so, we have two key observations: 1) even\nthough two libraries can share classes, the shared classes cannot be integrated\ninto an app simultaneously without causing a class name conflict; and 2) code\nduplication between multiple versions of two libraries can vary. Based on these\nfindings, we propose a novel profile-based similarity comparison approach to\nperform the detection.

    "title": "ORF-Net: Deep Omni-supervised Rib Fracture Detection from Chest CT Scans",
    "abstract": "Most of the existing object detection works are based on the bounding box\nannotation: each object has a precise annotated box. However, for rib\nfractures, the bounding box annotation is very labor-intensive and\ntime-consuming because radiologists need to investigate and annotate the rib\nfractures on a slice-by-slice basis. Although a few studies have proposed\nweakly-supervised methods or semi-supervised methods, they could not handle\ndifferent forms of supervision simultaneously. In this paper, we proposed a\nnovel omni-supervised object detection network, which can exploit multiple\ndifferent forms of annotated data to further improve the detection performance.\nSpecifically, the proposed network contains an omni-supervised detection head,\nin which each form of annotation data corresponds to a unique classification\nbranch. Furthermore, we proposed a dynamic label assignment strategy for\ndifferent annotated forms of data to facilitate better learning for each\nbranch. Moreover, we also design a confidence-aware classification loss to\nemphasize the samples with high confidence and further improve the model's\nperformance. Extensive experiments conducted on the testing dataset show our\nproposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches consistently,\ndemonstrating the efficacy of deep omni-supervised learning on improving rib\nfracture detection performance.",

    "abstract": "The research in the sixth generation of communication networks needs to\ntackle new challenges in order to meet the requirements of emerging\napplications in terms of high data rate, low latency, high reliability, and\nmassive connectivity. To this end, the entire communication chain needs to be\noptimized, including the channel and the surrounding environment, as it is no\nlonger sufficient to control the transmitter and/or the receiver only.\nInvestigating large intelligent surfaces, ultra massive\nmultiple-input-multiple-output, and smart constructive environments will\ncontribute to this direction. In addition, to allow the exchange of high\ndimensional sensing data between connected intelligent devices, semantic and\ngoal-oriented communications need to be considered for a more efficient and\ncontext-aware information encoding. In particular, for multi-agent systems,\nwhere agents are collaborating together to achieve a complex task, emergent\ncommunications, instead of hard-coded communications, can be learned for more\nefficient task execution and communication resources use. Moreover, the\ninteraction between information theory and electromagnetism should be explored\nto better understand the physical limitations of different technologies, e.g,\nholographic communications. Another new communication paradigm is to consider\nthe end-to-end approach instead of block-by-block optimization, which requires\nexploiting machine learning theory, non-linear signal processing theory, and\nnon-coherent communications theory. Within this context, we identify ten\nscientific challenges for rebuilding the theoretical foundations of\ncommunications, and we overview each of the challenges while providing research\nopportunities and open questions for the research community.",

    "abstract": "Self-attention mechanisms model long-range context by using pairwise\nattention between all input tokens. In doing so, they assume a fixed attention\ngranularity defined by the individual tokens (e.g., text characters or image\npixels), which may not be optimal for modeling complex dependencies at higher\nlevels. In this paper, we propose ContextPool to address this problem by\nadapting the attention granularity for each token. Inspired by the success of\nConvNets that are combined with pooling to capture long-range dependencies, we\nlearn to pool neighboring features for each token before computing attention in\na given attention layer. The pooling weights and support size are adaptively\ndetermined, allowing the pooled features to encode meaningful context with\nvarying scale. We show that ContextPool makes attention models more expressive,\nachieving strong performance often with fewer layers and thus significantly\nreduced cost. Experiments validate that our ContextPool module, when plugged\ninto transformer models, matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance\nusing less compute on several language and image benchmarks, outperforms recent\nworks with learned context sizes or sparse attention patterns, and is also\napplicable to ConvNets for efficient feature learning.",

Our method\nis very simple: it is fully entailed in the weights of a single neural network,\nand a single forward pass directly yields predictions for a new dataset. Our\nAutoML method is meta-learned using the Transformer-based Prior-Data Fitted\nNetwork (PFN) architecture and approximates Bayesian inference with a prior\nthat is based on assumptions of simplicity and causal structures. The prior\ncontains a large space of structural causal models and Bayesian neural networks\nwith a bias for small architectures and thus low complexity. Furthermore, we\nextend the PFN approach to differentiably calibrate the prior's hyperparameters\non real data. By doing so, we separate our abstract prior assumptions from\ntheir heuristic calibration on real data. Afterwards, the calibrated\nhyperparameters are fixed and TabPFN can be applied to any new tabular dataset\nat the push of a button.

    "abstract": "Conventional object-stores are built on top of traditional OS storage stack,\nwhere I/O requests typically transfers through multiple hefty and redundant\nlayers. The complexity of object management has grown dramatically with the\never increasing requirements of performance, consistency and fault-tolerance\nfrom storage subsystems. Simply stated, more number of intermediate layers are\nencountered in the I/O data path, with each passing layer adding its own syntax\nand semantics. Thereby increasing the overheads of request processing. In this\npaper, through comprehensive under-the-hood analysis of an object-storage node,\nwe characterize the impact of object-store (and user-application) workloads on\nthe OS I/O stack and its subsequent rippling effect on the underlying\nobject-storage devices (OSD). We observe that the legacy architecture of the OS\nbased I/O storage stack coupled with complex data management policies leads to\na performance mismatch between what an end-storage device is capable of\ndelivering and what it actually delivers in a production environment.\nTherefore, the gains derived from developing faster storage devices is often\nnullified. These issues get more pronounced in highly concurrent and\nmultiplexed cloud environments. Owing to the associated issues of\nobject-management and the vulnerabilities of the OS I/O software stacks, we\ndiscuss the potential of a new class of storage devices, known as\nObject-Drives. Samsung Key-Value SSD (KV-SSD) [1] and Seagate Kinetic Drive [2]\nare classic industrial implementations of object-drives, where host data\nmanagement functionalities can be offloaded to the storage device. This leads\ntowards the simplification of the over-all storage stack.

Despite the growing progress on\nbenchmarks, we realize that existing methods often perform unsatisfactorily on\ndistant interactions, where the leading causes are two-fold: 1) Distant\ninteractions are by nature more difficult to recognize than close ones. A\nnatural scene often involves multiple humans and objects with intricate spatial\nrelations, making the interaction recognition for distant human-object largely\naffected by complex visual context. 2) Insufficient number of distant\ninteractions in benchmark datasets results in under-fitting on these instances.\nTo address these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel two-stage method\nfor better handling distant interactions in HOI detection. One essential\ncomponent in our method is a novel Far Near Distance Attention module. It\nenables information propagation between humans and objects, whereby the spatial\ndistance is skillfully taken into consideration. Besides, we devise a novel\nDistance-Aware loss function which leads the model to focus more on distant yet\nrare interactions.

To identify such unseen labels, multi-label zero-shot learning\n(ML-ZSL) focuses on transferring knowledge by a pre-trained textual label\nembedding (e.g., GloVe). However, such methods only exploit singlemodal\nknowledge from a language model, while ignoring the rich semantic information\ninherent in image-text pairs. Instead, recently developed open-vocabulary (OV)\nbased methods succeed in exploiting such information of image-text pairs in\nobject detection, and achieve impressive performance. Inspired by the success\nof OV-based methods, we propose a novel open-vocabulary framework, named\nmultimodal knowledge transfer (MKT), for multi-label classification.\nSpecifically, our method exploits multi-modal knowledge of image-text pairs\nbased on a vision and language pretraining (VLP) model. To facilitate\ntransferring the imagetext matching ability of VLP model, knowledge\ndistillation is used to guarantee the consistency of image and label\nembeddings, along with prompt tuning to further update the label embeddings. To\nfurther recognize multiple objects, a simple but effective two-stream module is\ndeveloped to capture both local and global features. Extensive experimental\nresults show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-theart methods\non public benchmark datasets. Code will be available at\nhttps://github.com/seanhe97/MKT.",

Existing face forgery detection methods based on\nfrequency domain find that the GAN forged images have obvious grid-like visual\nartifacts in the frequency spectrum compared to the real images.

FCAN-DCT consists of a backbone\nnetwork and two branches: Compact Feature Extraction (CFE) module and Frequency\nTemporal Attention (FTA) module. We conduct thorough experimental assessments\non two visible light (VIS) based datasets WildDeepfake and Celeb-DF (v2), and\nour self-built video forgery dataset DeepfakeNIR, which is the first video\nforgery dataset on near-infrared modality.

    "abstract": "Derivation of the probability density evolution provides invaluable insight\ninto the behavior of many stochastic systems and their performance. However,\nfor most real-time applica-tions, numerical determination of the probability\ndensity evolution is a formidable task. The latter is due to the required\ntemporal and spatial discretization schemes that render most computational\nsolutions prohibitive and impractical. In this respect, the development of an\nefficient computational surrogate model is of paramount importance. Recent\nstudies on the physics-constrained networks show that a suitable surrogate can\nbe achieved by encoding the physical insight into a deep neural network. To\nthis aim, the present work introduces DeepPDEM which utilizes the concept of\nphysics-informed networks to solve the evolution of the probability density via\nproposing a deep learning method. DeepPDEM learns the General Density Evolution\nEquation (GDEE) of stochastic structures. This approach paves the way for a\nmesh-free learning method that can solve the density evolution problem with-out\nprior simulation data. Moreover, it can also serve as an efficient surrogate\nfor the solu-tion at any other spatiotemporal points within optimization\nschemes or real-time applica-tions.

The\naveraged scorer's subjectivity is transferred into the model, losing\ninformation about the internal variability among different scorers. In this\nstudy, we aim to insert the multiple-knowledge of the different physicians into\nthe training procedure.The goal is to optimize a model training, exploiting the\nfull information that can be extracted from the consensus of a group of\nscorers.\nMethods: We train two lightweight deep learning based models on three\ndifferent multi-scored databases.

    "abstract": "Most of the current explainability techniques focus on capturing the\nimportance of features in input space. However, given the complexity of models\nand data-generating processes, the resulting explanations are far from being\n`complete', in that they lack an indication of feature interactions and\nvisualization of their `effect'. In this work, we propose a novel\ntwin-surrogate explainability framework to explain the decisions made by any\nCNN-based image classifier (irrespective of the architecture). For this, we\nfirst disentangle latent features from the classifier, followed by aligning\nthese features to observed/human-defined `context' features. These aligned\nfeatures form semantically meaningful concepts that are used for extracting a\ncausal graph depicting the `perceived' data-generating process, describing the\ninter- and intra-feature interactions between unobserved latent features and\nobserved `context' features. This causal graph serves as a global model from\nwhich local explanations of different forms can be extracted. Specifically, we\nprovide a generator to visualize the `effect' of interactions among features in\nlatent space and draw feature importance therefrom as local explanations. Our\nframework utilizes adversarial knowledge distillation to faithfully learn a\nrepresentation from the classifiers' latent space and use it for extracting\nvisual explanations. We use the styleGAN-v2 architecture with an additional\nregularization term to enforce disentanglement and alignment. We demonstrate\nand evaluate explanations obtained with our framework on Morpho-MNIST and on\nthe FFHQ human faces dataset.

In this\npaper we present an innovative Humanin-The-Loop Cyber Physical system that can\ncollect passive data from people, such as physical activity, sleep information,\nand discrete location, as well as collect self-reported data, and provide\nindividualised user feedback. In this paper, we also present a three and a half\nmonths field trial implemented in Portugal. This trial was part of a larger\nscope project that was supported by the Portuguese National Health System, to\nevaluate the indicators and effects of the pandemic. Results concerning various\napplications usage statistics are presented, comparing the most used\napplications, their objective and their usage pattern in work/non-work periods.\nAdditionally,the time-lagged cross correlation between some of the collected\nmetrics, Covid events, and media news, are explored. This type of applications\ncan be used not only in the context of Covid but also in future pandemics, to\nassist individuals in self-regulation of their contagion risk, based on\npersonalized information, while also function as a means for raising\nself-awareness of risks related to psychological wellbeing.",

    "abstract": "Numerous significant progress on fisheye image rectification has been\nachieved through CNN. Nevertheless, constrained by a fixed receptive field, the\nglobal distribution and the local symmetry of the distortion have not been\nfully exploited. To leverage these two characteristics, we introduced\nFishformer that processes the fisheye image as a sequence to enhance global and\nlocal perception. We tuned the Transformer according to the structural\nproperties of fisheye images. First, the uneven distortion distribution in\npatches generated by the existing square slicing method confuses the network,\nresulting in difficult training. Therefore, we propose an annulus slicing\nmethod to maintain the consistency of the distortion in each patch, thus\nperceiving the distortion distribution well. Second, we analyze that different\ndistortion parameters have their own efficacy domains. Hence, the perception of\nthe local area is as important as the global, but Transformer has a weakness\nfor local texture perception. Therefore, we propose a novel layer attention\nmechanism to enhance the local perception and texture transfer. Our network\nsimultaneously implements global perception and focused local perception\ndecided by the different parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nmethod provides superior performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.",

The thermal camera is shown to be a feasible solution\nas good as the video camera, even if the camera employed here has a lower\nresolution. Two other novelties of our work are the creation of a new public\ndataset of multi-sensor annotated data that expand the number of classes in\ncomparison to existing ones, as well as the study of the detector performance\nas a function of the sensor-to-target distance.

To this end, the power consumption of several\ntypical tasks in the aforementioned common data science tasks will be measured\nand compared to: large-scale \"advanced\" data science, common computer-related\ntasks, and everyday non-computer related tasks. This is done by converting the\nmeasurements to the equivalent unit of \"km driven by car\".

In this work, we focus on end-to-end solutions for EL on\ntabular data that do not rely on fact lookup in the target KB. Tabular data\ncontains heterogeneous and sparse context, including column headers, cell\nvalues and table captions. We experiment with various models to generate a\nvector representation for each cell value to be linked. Our results show that\nit is critical to apply an attention mechanism as well as an attention mask, so\nthat the model can only attend to the most relevant context and avoid\ninformation dilution. The most relevant context includes: same-row cells,\nsame-column cells, headers and caption. Computational complexity, however,\ngrows quadratically with the size of tabular data for such a complex model. We\nachieve constant memory usage by introducing a Tabular Entity Linking Lite\nmodel (TELL ) that generates vector representation for a cell based only on its\nvalue, the table headers and the table caption.

They often happen as a result of source\ncode changes (e.g., a bug fix) and can have severe effects.\nAims: To increase the understanding of security regressions. This is an\nimportant step in developing secure software engineering.\nMethod: We perform an exploratory, mixed-method case study of Mozilla. First,\nwe analyze 78 regression vulnerabilities and 72 bug reports where a bug fix\nintroduced a regression vulnerability at Mozilla. We investigate how developers\ninteract in these bug reports, how they perform the changes, and under what\nconditions they introduce regression vulnerabilities. Second, we conduct five\nsemi-structured interviews with as many Mozilla developers involved in the\nvulnerability-inducing bug fixes.\nResults: Software security is not discussed during bug fixes. Developers'\nmain concerns are the complexity of the bug at hand and the community pressure\nto fix it. Moreover, developers do not to worry about regression\nvulnerabilities and assume tools will detect them. Indeed, dynamic analysis\ntools helped finding around 30% of regression vulnerabilities at Mozilla.\nConclusions: These results provide evidence that, although tool support helps\nidentify regression vulnerabilities, it may not be enough to ensure security\nduring bug fixes. Furthermore, our results call for further work on the\nsecurity tooling support and how to integrate them during bug fixes.\nData and materials: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6792317",

This study focuses on the semantics of noun singulars and their\nplural inflectional variants in English. Our goal is to compare two models for\nthe conceptualization of plurality. One model (FRACSS) proposes that all\nsingular-plural pairs should be taken into account when predicting plural\nsemantics from singular semantics. The other model (CCA) argues that\nconceptualization for plurality depends primarily on the semantic class of the\nbase word. We compare the two models on the basis of how well the speech signal\nof plural tokens in a large corpus of spoken American English aligns with the\nsemantic vectors predicted by the two models. Two measures are employed: the\nperformance of a form-to-meaning mapping and the correlations between form\ndistances and meaning distances. Results converge on a superior alignment for\nCCA. Our results suggest that usage-based approaches to pluralization in which\na given word's own semantic neighborhood is given priority outperform theories\naccording to which pluralization is conceptualized as a process building on\nhigh-level abstraction.

In this paper, we introduce a novel initiative\nadvisor-in-the-loop actor-critic framework, termed as Ask-AC, that replaces the\nunilateral advisor-guidance mechanism with a bidirectional learner-initiative\none, and thereby enables a customized and efficacious message exchange between\nlearner and advisor. At the heart of Ask-AC are two complementary components,\nnamely action requester and adaptive state selector, that can be readily\nincorporated into various discrete actor-critic architectures. The former\ncomponent allows the agent to initiatively seek advisor intervention in the\npresence of uncertain states, while the latter identifies the unstable states\npotentially missed by the former especially when environment changes, and then\nlearns to promote the ask action on such states. Experimental results on both\nstationary and non-stationary environments and across different actor-critic\nbackbones demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the\nlearning efficiency of the agent, and achieves the performances on par with\nthose obtained by continuous advisor monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Explicit step-truncation tensor methods have recently proven successful in\nintegrating initial value problems for high-dimensional partial differential\nequations (PDEs). However, the combination of non-linearity and stiffness may\nintroduce time-step restrictions which could make explicit integration\ncomputationally infeasible. To overcome this problem, in this paper we develop\na new class of implicit rank-adaptive algorithms for temporal integration of\nnonlinear evolution equations on tensor manifolds. These algorithms are based\non performing one time step with a conventional time-stepping scheme, followed\nby an implicit fixed point iteration step involving a rank-adaptive truncation\noperation onto a tensor manifold. Implicit step truncation methods are\nstraightforward to implement as they rely only on arithmetic operations between\ntensors, which can be performed by efficient and scalable parallel algorithms.\nNumerical applications demonstrating the effectiveness of implicit\nstep-truncation tensor integrators are presented and discussed for the\nAllen-Cahn equation, the Fokker-Planck equation, and the nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger equation.",

In addition, we found that GN can only help\nthe neural network training in some specific period, unlike BN, which helps the\nnetwork throughout the training. To solve these issues, we propose a new\nnormalization layer built on top of GN, by incorporating the advantages of BN.\nExperimental results on the image classification task demonstrated that the\nproposed normalization layer outperforms the official GN to improve recognition\naccuracy regardless of the batch sizes and stabilize the network training.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) provides autonomy and privacy by design to\nparticipating peers, who cooperatively build a machine learning (ML) model\nwhile keeping their private data in their devices. However, that same autonomy\nopens the door for malicious peers to poison the model by conducting either\nuntargeted or targeted poisoning attacks. The label-flipping (LF) attack is a\ntargeted poisoning attack where the attackers poison their training data by\nflipping the labels of some examples from one class (i.e., the source class) to\nanother (i.e., the target class). Unfortunately, this attack is easy to perform\nand hard to detect and it negatively impacts on the performance of the global\nmodel. Existing defenses against LF are limited by assumptions on the\ndistribution of the peers' data and/or do not perform well with\nhigh-dimensional models. In this paper, we deeply investigate the LF attack\nbehavior and find that the contradicting objectives of attackers and honest\npeers on the source class examples are reflected in the parameter gradients\ncorresponding to the neurons of the source and target classes in the output\nlayer, making those gradients good discriminative features for the attack\ndetection. Accordingly, we propose a novel defense that first dynamically\nextracts those gradients from the peers' local updates, and then clusters the\nextracted gradients, analyzes the resulting clusters and filters out potential\nbad updates before model aggregation. Extensive empirical analysis on three\ndata sets shows the proposed defense's effectiveness against the LF attack\nregardless of the data distribution or model dimensionality. Also, the proposed\ndefense outperforms several state-of-the-art defenses by offering lower test\nerror, higher overall accuracy, higher source class accuracy, lower attack\nsuccess rate, and higher stability of the source class accuracy.",

Moreover, it is extremely laborious and expensive to collect and\nfully annotate a point-cloud detection dataset with numerous classes of\nobjects, leading to the limited classes of existing point-cloud datasets and\nhindering the model to learn general representations to achieve open-vocabulary\npoint-cloud detection. As far as we know, we are the first to study the problem\nof open-vocabulary 3D point-cloud detection. Instead of seeking a point-cloud\ndataset with full labels, we resort to ImageNet1K to broaden the vocabulary of\nthe point-cloud detector. We propose OV-3DETIC, an Open-Vocabulary 3D DETector\nusing Image-level Class supervision. Specifically, we take advantage of two\nmodalities, the image modality for recognition and the point-cloud modality for\nlocalization, to generate pseudo labels for unseen classes. Then we propose a\nnovel debiased cross-modal contrastive learning method to transfer the\nknowledge from image modality to point-cloud modality during training. Without\nhurting the latency during inference, OV-3DETIC makes the point-cloud detector\ncapable of achieving open-vocabulary detection. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that the proposed OV-3DETIC achieves at least 10.77 % mAP\nimprovement (absolute value) and 9.56 % mAP improvement (absolute value) by a\nwide range of baselines on the SUN-RGBD dataset and ScanNet dataset,\nrespectively.

Concretely, Block-SCL builds enriched batches using the\nhard-negatives samples obtained in the blocking stage. These batches provide a\nstrong training signal leading the model to learn more meaningful sentence\nembeddings for product matching. Experimental results in several public\ndatasets demonstrate that Block-SCL achieves state-of-the-art results despite\nonly using short product titles as input, no data augmentation, and a lighter\ntransformer backbone than competing methods.",

    "abstract": "Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is the task of disaggregating the total\npower consumption into its individual sub-components. Over the years, signal\nprocessing and machine learning algorithms have been combined to achieve this.\nA lot of publications and extensive research works are performed on energy\ndisaggregation or NILM for the state-of-the-art methods to reach on the\ndesirable performance. The initial interest of the scientific community to\nformulate and describe mathematically the NILM problem using machine learning\ntools has now shifted into a more practical NILM. Nowadays, we are in the\nmature NILM period where there is an attempt for NILM to be applied in\nreal-life application scenarios. Thus, complexity of the algorithms,\ntransferability, reliability, practicality and in general trustworthiness are\nthe main issues of interest. This review narrows the gap between the early\nimmature NILM era and the mature one. In particular, the paper provides a\ncomprehensive literature review of the NILM methods for residential appliances\nonly. The paper analyzes, summarizes and presents the outcomes of a large\nnumber of recently published scholarly articles. Also, the paper discusses the\nhighlights of these methods and introduces the research dilemmas that should be\ntaken into consideration by researchers to apply NILM methods.

    "abstract": "Multiview detection uses multiple calibrated cameras with overlapping fields\nof views to locate occluded pedestrians. In this field, existing methods\ntypically adopt a ``human modeling - aggregation'' strategy. To find robust\npedestrian representations, some intuitively use locations of detected 2D\nbounding boxes, while others use entire frame features projected to the ground\nplane. However, the former does not consider human appearance and leads to many\nambiguities, and the latter suffers from projection errors due to the lack of\naccurate height of the human torso and head. In this paper, we propose a new\npedestrian representation scheme based on human point clouds modeling.\nSpecifically, using ray tracing for holistic human depth estimation, we model\npedestrians as upright, thin cardboard point clouds on the ground. Then, we\naggregate the point clouds of the pedestrian cardboard across multiple views\nfor a final decision. Compared with existing representations, the proposed\nmethod explicitly leverages human appearance and reduces projection errors\nsignificantly by relatively accurate height estimation.

To\naddress this limitation, we present a generalised multiparty session type\n(MPST) theory with crash-stop failures, where processes can crash arbitrarily.\nOur new theory validates more protocols and processes w.r.t previous work. We\napply minimal syntactic changes to standard session $\\pi$-calculus and types:\nwe model crashes and their handling semantically, with a generalised MPST\ntyping system parametric on a behavioural safety property. We cover the\nspectrum between fully reliable and fully unreliable sessions, via optional\nreliability assumptions, and prove type safety and protocol conformance in the\npresence of crash-stop failures.\nIntroducing crash-stop failures has non-trivial consequences: writing correct\nprocesses that handle all crash scenarios can be difficult. Yet, our\ngeneralised MPST theory allows us to tame this complexity, via model checking,\nto validate whether a multiparty session satisfies desired behavioural\nproperties, e.g. deadlock-freedom or liveness, even in presence of crashes.

    "abstract": "To address the ill-posed problem caused by partial observations in monocular\nhuman volumetric capture, we present AvatarCap, a novel framework that\nintroduces animatable avatars into the capture pipeline for high-fidelity\nreconstruction in both visible and invisible regions. Our method firstly\ncreates an animatable avatar for the subject from a small number (~20) of 3D\nscans as a prior. Then given a monocular RGB video of this subject, our method\nintegrates information from both the image observation and the avatar prior,\nand accordingly recon-structs high-fidelity 3D textured models with dynamic\ndetails regardless of the visibility. To learn an effective avatar for\nvolumetric capture from only few samples, we propose GeoTexAvatar, which\nleverages both geometry and texture supervisions to constrain the\npose-dependent dynamics in a decomposed implicit manner. An avatar-conditioned\nvolumetric capture method that involves a canonical normal fusion and a\nreconstruction network is further proposed to integrate both image observations\nand avatar dynamics for high-fidelity reconstruction in both observed and\ninvisible regions. Overall, our method enables monocular human volumetric\ncapture with detailed and pose-dependent dynamics, and the experiments show\nthat our method outperforms state of the art.

    "abstract": "In safety-critical deep learning applications robustness measurement is a\nvital pre-deployment phase. However, existing robustness verification methods\nare not sufficiently practical for deploying machine learning systems in the\nreal world. On the one hand, these methods attempt to claim that no\nperturbations can ``fool'' deep neural networks (DNNs), which may be too\nstringent in practice. On the other hand, existing works rigorously consider\n$L_p$ bounded additive perturbations on the pixel space, although\nperturbations, such as colour shifting and geometric transformations, are more\npractically and frequently occurring in the real world. Thus, from the\npractical standpoint, we present a novel and general {\\it probabilistic\nrobustness assessment method} (PRoA) based on the adaptive concentration, and\nit can measure the robustness of deep learning models against functional\nperturbations. PRoA can provide statistical guarantees on the probabilistic\nrobustness of a model, \\textit{i.e.}, the probability of failure encountered by\nthe trained model after deployment. Our experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness and flexibility of PRoA in terms of evaluating the probabilistic\nrobustness against a broad range of functional perturbations, and PRoA can\nscale well to various large-scale deep neural networks compared to existing\nstate-of-the-art baselines.

However, there is still a lack of study on how to distill\nbetween heterogeneous detectors. In this paper, we empirically find that better\nFPN features from a heterogeneous teacher detector can help the student\nalthough their detection heads and label assignments are different. However,\ndirectly aligning the feature maps to distill detectors suffers from two\nproblems. First, the difference in feature magnitude between the teacher and\nthe student could enforce overly strict constraints on the student. Second, the\nFPN stages and channels with large feature magnitude from the teacher model\ncould dominate the gradient of distillation loss, which will overwhelm the\neffects of other features in KD and introduce much noise. To address the above\nissues, we propose to imitate features with Pearson Correlation Coefficient to\nfocus on the relational information from the teacher and relax constraints on\nthe magnitude of the features. Our method consistently outperforms the existing\ndetection KD methods and works for both homogeneous and heterogeneous\nstudent-teacher pairs. Furthermore, it converges faster.

    "abstract": "Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a promising technology for enhancing the\ncomputation capacities and features of mobile users by offloading complex\ncomputation tasks to the edge servers. However, mobility poses great challenges\non delivering reliable MEC service required for latency-critical applications.\nFirst, mobility management has to tackle the dynamics of both user's location\nchanges and task arrivals that vary in different timescales. Second, user\nmobility could induce service migration, leading to reliability loss due to the\nmigration delay. In this paper, we propose a two-timescale mobility management\nframework by joint control of service migration and transmission power to\naddress the above challenges. Specifically, the service migration operates at a\nlarge timescale to support user mobility in the multi-cell network, while the\npower control is performed at a small timescale for real-time task offloading.\nTheir joint control is formulated as an optimization problem aiming at the\nlong-term mobile energy minimization subject to the reliability requirement of\ncomputation offloading. To solve the problem, we propose a Lyapunov-based\nframework to decompose the problem into different timescales, based on which a\nlow-complexity two-timescale online algorithm is developed by exploiting the\nproblem structure. The proposed online algorithm is shown to be asymptotically\noptimal via theoretical analysis, and is further developed to accommodate the\nmultiuser management.

Our\nKorn's inequality is expressed with minimal jump terms. These minimal jump\nterms are identified by characterizing the restriction of rigid body mode to\nedge/face of the partitions. Such minimal jump conditions are shown to be sharp\nfor achieving the Korn's inequality as well. The sharpness of our result and\nexplicitly given minimal conditions can be used to test whether any given\nfinite element spaces satisfy Korn's inequality, immediately as well as to\nbuild or modify nonconforming finite elements for Korn's inequality to hold.",

    "abstract": "Expressions that involve matrices and vectors, known as linear algebra\nexpressions, are commonly evaluated through a sequence of invocations to highly\noptimised kernels provided in libraries such as BLAS and LAPACK. A sequence of\nkernels represents an algorithm, and in general, because of associativity,\nalgebraic identities, and multiple kernels, one expression can be evaluated via\nmany different algorithms. These algorithms are all mathematically equivalent\n(i.e., in exact arithmetic, they all compute the same result), but often differ\nnoticeably in terms of execution time. When faced with a decision, high-level\nlanguages, libraries, and tools such as Julia, Armadillo, and Linnea choose by\nselecting the algorithm that minimises the FLOP count. In this paper, we test\nthe validity of the FLOP count as a discriminant for dense linear algebra\nalgorithms, analysing \"anomalies\": problem instances for which the fastest\nalgorithm does not perform the least number of FLOPs.\nTo do so, we focused on relatively simple expressions and analysed when and\nwhy anomalies occurred. We found that anomalies exist and tend to cluster into\nlarge contiguous regions. For one expression anomalies were rare, whereas for\nthe other they were abundant. We conclude that FLOPs is not a sufficiently\ndependable discriminant even when building algorithms with highly optimised\nkernels. Plus, most of the anomalies remained as such even after filtering out\nthe inter-kernel cache effects. We conjecture that combining FLOP counts with\nkernel performance models will significantly improve our ability to choose\noptimal algorithms.",

To do so, a new\nenvironment - compatible with OpenAI's Gym - was designed and implemented to\nemulate the operation of MCF-EONs. The new environment processes the agent\nactions (selection of route, core and spectrum slot) by considering the network\nstate and physical-layer-related aspects. The latter includes the available\nmodulation formats and their reach and the inter-core crosstalk (XT), an\nMCF-related impairment. If the resulting quality of the signal is acceptable,\nthe environment allocates the resources selected by the agent. After processing\nthe agent's action, the environment is configured to give the agent a numerical\nreward and information about the new network state. The blocking performance of\nfour different agents was compared through simulation to 3 baseline heuristics\nused in MCF-EONs.

    "abstract": "Integer programming (IP) is an important and challenging problem. Approximate\nmethods have shown promising performance on both effectiveness and efficiency\nfor solving the IP problem. However, we observed that a large fraction of\nvariables solved by some iterative approximate methods fluctuate around their\nfinal converged discrete states in very long iterations. Inspired by this\nobservation, we aim to accelerate these approximate methods by early fixing\nthese fluctuated variables to their converged states while not significantly\nharming the solution accuracy. To this end, we propose an early fixing\nframework along with the approximate method. We formulate the whole early\nfixing process as a Markov decision process, and train it using imitation\nlearning. A policy network will evaluate the posterior probability of each free\nvariable concerning its discrete candidate states in each block of iterations.\nSpecifically, we adopt the powerful multi-headed attention mechanism in the\npolicy network. Extensive experiments on our proposed early fixing framework\nare conducted to three different IP applications: constrained linear\nprogramming, MRF energy minimization and sparse adversarial attack. The former\none is linear IP problem, while the latter two are quadratic IP problems. We\nextend the problem scale from regular size to significantly large size. The\nextensive experiments reveal the competitiveness of our early fixing framework:\nthe runtime speeds up significantly, while the solution quality does not\ndegrade much, even in some cases it is available to obtain better solutions.\nOur proposed early fixing framework can be regarded as an acceleration\nextension of ADMM methods for solving integer programming.

    "abstract": "Understanding how machine learning models generalize to new environments is a\ncritical part of their safe deployment. Recent work has proposed a variety of\ncomplexity measures that directly predict or theoretically bound the\ngeneralization capacity of a model. However, these methods rely on a strong set\nof assumptions that in practice are not always satisfied. Motivated by the\nlimited settings in which existing measures can be applied, we propose a novel\ncomplexity measure based on the local manifold smoothness of a classifier. We\ndefine local manifold smoothness as a classifier's output sensitivity to\nperturbations in the manifold neighborhood around a given test point.\nIntuitively, a classifier that is less sensitive to these perturbations should\ngeneralize better. To estimate smoothness we sample points using data\naugmentation and measure the fraction of these points classified into the\nmajority class. Our method only requires selecting a data augmentation method\nand makes no other assumptions about the model or data distributions, meaning\nit can be applied even in out-of-domain (OOD) settings where existing methods\ncannot. In experiments on robustness benchmarks in image classification,\nsentiment analysis, and natural language inference, we demonstrate a strong and\nrobust correlation between our manifold smoothness measure and actual OOD\ngeneralization on over 3,000 models evaluated on over 100 train/test domain\npairs.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks are the most commonly used function approximators in\noffline Reinforcement Learning these days. Prior works have shown that neural\nnets trained with TD-learning and gradient descent can exhibit implicit\nregularization that can be characterized by under-parameterization of these\nnetworks. Specifically, the rank of the penultimate feature layer, also called\n\\textit{effective rank}, has been observed to drastically collapse during the\ntraining. In turn, this collapse has been argued to reduce the model's ability\nto further adapt in later stages of learning, leading to the diminished final\nperformance. Such an association between the effective rank and performance\nmakes effective rank compelling for offline RL, primarily for offline policy\nevaluation. In this work, we conduct a careful empirical study on the relation\nbetween effective rank and performance on three offline RL datasets : bsuite,\nAtari, and DeepMind lab. We observe that a direct association exists only in\nrestricted settings and disappears in the more extensive hyperparameter sweeps.\nAlso, we empirically identify three phases of learning that explain the impact\nof implicit regularization on the learning dynamics and found that\nbootstrapping alone is insufficient to explain the collapse of the effective\nrank. Further, we show that several other factors could confound the\nrelationship between effective rank and performance and conclude that studying\nthis association under simplistic assumptions could be highly misleading.",

Instead of ignoring smaller, acted\ndatasets, this study investigates whether information learnt from acted\nemotions is useful for detecting natural emotions. Cross-corpus research has\nmostly considered cross-lingual and even cross-age datasets, and difficulties\narise from different methods of annotating emotions causing a drop in\nperformance. To be consistent, four adult English datasets covering acted,\nelicited and natural emotions are considered. A state-of-the-art model is\nproposed to accurately investigate the degradation of performance. The system\ninvolves a bi-directional LSTM with an attention mechanism to classify emotions\nacross datasets. Experiments study the effects of training models in a\ncross-corpus and multi-domain fashion and results show the transfer of\ninformation is not successful. Out-of-domain models, followed by adapting to\nthe missing dataset, and domain adversarial training (DAT) are shown to be more\nsuitable to generalising to emotions across datasets. This shows positive\ninformation transfer from acted datasets to those with more natural emotions\nand the benefits from training on different corpora.",

The\narchitecture consists of two layers (ingress and egress), operated by disjoint\nproviders. The service is directly integrated into Apple's operating systems\nand therefore provides a low entry level barrier for a large user base. It\nseems to be set up for major adoption with its relatively moderate entry-level\nprice. This paper analyzes the iCloud Private Relay from a network perspective\nand its effect on the Internet and future measurement-based research. We\nperform EDNS0 Client Subnet DNS queries to collect ingress relay addresses and\nfind 1586 IPv4 addresses. Supplementary RIPE Atlas DNS measurements reveal 1575\nIPv6 addresses. Knowledge about these addresses helps to passively detect\nclients communicating through the relay network. According to our scans, from\nJanuary through April, ingress addresses grew by 20%. The analysis of our scans\nthrough the relay network verifies Apple's claim of rotating egress addresses.\nNevertheless, it reveals that ingress and egress relays can be located in the\nsame autonomous system, thus sharing similar routes, potentially allowing\ntraffic correlation.",

    "abstract": "The standard supervised learning paradigm works effectively when training\ndata shares the same distribution as the upcoming testing samples. However,\nthis assumption is often violated in real-world applications, especially when\ntesting data appear in an online fashion. In this paper, we formulate and\ninvestigate the problem of online label shift (OLaS): the learner trains an\ninitial model from the labeled offline data and then deploys it to an unlabeled\nonline environment where the underlying label distribution changes over time\nbut the label-conditional density does not. The non-stationarity nature and the\nlack of supervision make the problem challenging to be tackled. To address the\ndifficulty, we construct a new unbiased risk estimator that utilizes the\nunlabeled data, which exhibits many benign properties albeit with potential\nnon-convexity. Building upon that, we propose novel online ensemble algorithms\nto deal with the non-stationarity of the environments. Our approach enjoys\noptimal dynamic regret, indicating that the performance is competitive with a\nclairvoyant who knows the online environments in hindsight and then chooses the\nbest decision for each round. The obtained dynamic regret bound scales with the\nintensity and pattern of label distribution shift, hence exhibiting the\nadaptivity in the OLaS problem.

    "abstract": "Existing transformer-based image backbones typically propagate feature\ninformation in one direction from lower to higher-levels. This may not be ideal\nsince the localization ability to delineate accurate object boundaries, is most\nprominent in the lower, high-resolution feature maps, while the semantics that\ncan disambiguate image signals belonging to one object vs. another, typically\nemerges in a higher level of processing. We present Hierarchical Inter-Level\nAttention (HILA), an attention-based method that captures Bottom-Up and\nTop-Down Updates between features of different levels. HILA extends\nhierarchical vision transformer architectures by adding local connections\nbetween features of higher and lower levels to the backbone encoder. In each\niteration, we construct a hierarchy by having higher-level features compete for\nassignments to update lower-level features belonging to them, iteratively\nresolving object-part relationships. These improved lower-level features are\nthen used to re-update the higher-level features. HILA can be integrated into\nthe majority of hierarchical architectures without requiring any changes to the\nbase model. We add HILA into SegFormer and the Swin Transformer and show\nnotable improvements in accuracy in semantic segmentation with fewer parameters\nand FLOPS.

For the non-negative version, we show\nthat a popular heuristic is a $O( \\log |X|)$ ($|X|$ being the total flow of\n$X$) on graphs satisfying two properties related to the width (satisfied by\ne.g., series-parallel graphs), and strengthen its worst-case approximation\nratio from $\\Omega(\\sqrt{m})$ to $\\Omega(m / \\log m)$ for sparse graphs, where\n$m$ is the number of edges in the graph.

    "abstract": "Joint visual and language modeling on large-scale datasets has recently shown\na good progress in multi-modal tasks when compared to single modal learning.\nHowever, robustness of these approaches against real-world perturbations has\nnot been studied. In this work, we perform the first extensive robustness study\nof such models against various real-world perturbations focusing on video and\nlanguage. We focus on text-to-video retrieval and propose two large-scale\nbenchmark datasets, MSRVTT-P and YouCook2-P, which utilize 90 different visual\nand 35 different textual perturbations. The study reveals some interesting\nfindings: 1) The studied models are more robust when text is perturbed versus\nwhen video is perturbed 2) The transformer text encoder is more robust on\nnon-semantic changing text perturbations and visual perturbations compared to\nword embedding approaches. 3) Using two-branch encoders in isolation is\ntypically more robust than when architectures use cross-attention. We hope this\nstudy will serve as a benchmark and guide future research in robust multimodal\nlearning.",

    "abstract": "Social media networks have become a significant aspect of people's lives,\nserving as a platform for their ideas, opinions and emotions. Consequently,\nautomated sentiment analysis (SA) is critical for recognising people's feelings\nin ways that other information sources cannot. The analysis of these feelings\nrevealed various applications, including brand evaluations, YouTube film\nreviews and healthcare applications. As social media continues to develop,\npeople post a massive amount of information in different forms, including text,\nphotos, audio and video. Thus, traditional SA algorithms have become limited,\nas they do not consider the expressiveness of other modalities. By including\nsuch characteristics from various material sources, these multimodal data\nstreams provide new opportunities for optimising the expected results beyond\ntext-based SA. Our study focuses on the forefront field of multimodal SA, which\nexamines visual and textual data posted on social media networks. Many people\nare more likely to utilise this information to express themselves on these\nplatforms. To serve as a resource for academics in this rapidly growing field,\nwe introduce a comprehensive overview of textual and visual SA, including data\npre-processing, feature extraction techniques, sentiment benchmark datasets,\nand the efficacy of multiple classification methodologies suited to each field.\nWe also provide a brief introduction of the most frequently utilised data\nfusion strategies and a summary of existing research on visual-textual SA.\nFinally, we highlight the most significant challenges and investigate several\nimportant sentiment applications.",

    "abstract": "In the typical autonomous driving stack, planning and control systems\nrepresent two of the most crucial components in which data retrieved by sensors\nand processed by perception algorithms are used to implement a safe and\ncomfortable self-driving behavior. In particular, the planning module predicts\nthe path the autonomous car should follow taking the correct high-level\nmaneuver, while control systems perform a sequence of low-level actions,\ncontrolling steering angle, throttle and brake. In this work, we propose a\nmodel-free Deep Reinforcement Learning Planner training a neural network that\npredicts both acceleration and steering angle, thus obtaining a single module\nable to drive the vehicle using the data processed by localization and\nperception algorithms on board of the self-driving car. In particular, the\nsystem that was fully trained in simulation is able to drive smoothly and\nsafely in obstacle-free environments both in simulation and in a real-world\nurban area of the city of Parma, proving that the system features good\ngeneralization capabilities also driving in those parts outside the training\nscenarios.

    "abstract": "There is a growing interest in the challenging visual perception task of\nlearning from long-tailed class distributions. The extreme class imbalance in\nthe training dataset biases the model to prefer to recognize majority-class\ndata over minority-class data. Recently, the dual branch network (DBN)\nframework has been proposed, where two branch networks; the conventional branch\nand the re-balancing branch were employed to improve the accuracy of\nlong-tailed visual recognition. The re-balancing branch uses a reverse sampler\nto generate class-balanced training samples to mitigate bias due to class\nimbalance. Although this strategy has been quite successful in handling bias,\nusing a reversed sampler for training can degrade the representation learning\nperformance. To alleviate this issue, the conventional method used a carefully\ndesigned cumulative learning strategy, in which the influence of the\nre-balancing branch gradually increases throughout the entire training phase.\nIn this study, we aim to develop a simple yet effective method to improve the\nperformance of DBN without cumulative learning that is difficult to optimize.\nWe devise a simple data augmentation method termed bilateral mixup\naugmentation, which combines one sample from the uniform sampler with another\nsample from the reversed sampler to produce a training sample. Furthermore, we\npresent class-conditional temperature scaling that mitigates bias toward the\nmajority class for the proposed DBN architecture. Our experiments performed on\nwidely used long-tailed visual recognition datasets show that bilateral mixup\naugmentation is quite effective in improving the representation learning\nperformance of DBNs, and that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance for some categories.",

Software-Defined Networking\n(SDN) requires up to 18 fields of the packets header to be checked against a\nbig many-fields ruleset to categorize packets into flows, the process of\ncategorizing packets into flows is called packet classification. Network\nswitches process all packets belonging to the same flow in a similar manner by\napplying the same actions defined in the corresponding rule. Packet\nclassification facilitates supporting new services such as filtering, blocking\nunsafe sites traffic, routing packets based on the packet's header information,\nand giving priority to specific flows. High-performance algorithms for\nmany-field packet classification had been gained much interest in the research\ncommunities. This paper presents a new method to implement the many-fields\npacket classification of SDN flow table using Rectangle Tree (R-Tree). In this\nmethod, source and destination IP addresses from each flow table entry have\nbeen converted to a two-dimensional point. The remainders of the rule's fields\nhave been concatenated into a single field by taking the most important bits\nwith rules' ID in order to be inserted into the R-tree, for each rule an\neffective small binary flag is used to indicate the field's size, type, and\nranges. Subsequently, searching is performed on the rectangle tree to find the\nmatched rules according to the highest priority.

    "abstract": "Modern deep learning has achieved great success in various fields. However,\nit requires the labeling of huge amounts of data, which is expensive and\nlabor-intensive. Active learning (AL), which identifies the most informative\nsamples to be labeled, is becoming increasingly important to maximize the\nefficiency of the training process. The existing AL methods mostly use only a\nsingle final fixed model for acquiring the samples to be labeled. This strategy\nmay not be good enough in that the structural uncertainty of a model for given\ntraining data is not considered to acquire the samples. In this study, we\npropose a novel acquisition criterion based on temporal self-ensemble generated\nby conventional stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization. These\nself-ensemble models are obtained by capturing the intermediate network weights\nobtained through SGD iterations. Our acquisition function relies on a\nconsistency measure between the student and teacher models. The student models\nare given a fixed number of temporal self-ensemble models, and the teacher\nmodel is constructed by averaging the weights of the student models. Using the\nproposed acquisition criterion, we present an AL algorithm, namely\nstudent-teacher consistency-based AL (ST-CoNAL). Experiments conducted for\nimage classification tasks on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Caltech-256, and Tiny\nImageNet datasets demonstrate that the proposed ST-CoNAL achieves significantly\nbetter performance than the existing acquisition methods.

    "abstract": "Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks require an agent to navigate\nthrough the environment based on language instructions. In this paper, we aim\nto solve two key challenges in this task: utilizing multilingual instructions\nfor improved instruction-path grounding and navigating through new environments\nthat are unseen during training. To address these challenges, we propose CLEAR:\nCross-Lingual and Environment-Agnostic Representations. First, our agent learns\na shared and visually-aligned cross-lingual language representation for the\nthree languages (English, Hindi and Telugu) in the Room-Across-Room dataset.\nOur language representation learning is guided by text pairs that are aligned\nby visual information. Second, our agent learns an environment-agnostic visual\nrepresentation by maximizing the similarity between semantically-aligned image\npairs (with constraints on object-matching) from different environments. Our\nenvironment agnostic visual representation can mitigate the environment bias\ninduced by low-level visual information. Empirically, on the Room-Across-Room\ndataset, we show that our multilingual agent gets large improvements in all\nmetrics over the strong baseline model when generalizing to unseen environments\nwith the cross-lingual language representation and the environment-agnostic\nvisual representation. Furthermore, we show that our learned language and\nvisual representations can be successfully transferred to the Room-to-Room and\nCooperative Vision-and-Dialogue Navigation task, and present detailed\nqualitative and quantitative generalization and grounding analysis.

Passthrough techniques are intended to address this\nlimitation by leveraging outward-facing cameras to reconstruct the images that\nwould otherwise be seen by the user without the headset. This is inherently a\nreal-time view synthesis challenge, since passthrough cameras cannot be\nphysically co-located with the eyes. Existing passthrough techniques suffer\nfrom distracting reconstruction artifacts, largely due to the lack of accurate\ndepth information (especially for near-field and disoccluded objects), and also\nexhibit limited image quality (e.g., being low resolution and monochromatic).\nIn this paper, we propose the first learned passthrough method and assess its\nperformance using a custom VR headset that contains a stereo pair of RGB\ncameras.

While there\nare quite a few works of studying this method on various aspects, an\ninteresting question is how to choose its integration time to achieve\nacceleration. In this work, we consider accelerating the process of sampling\nfrom a distribution $\\pi(x) \\propto \\exp(-f(x))$ via HMC via time-varying\nintegration time. When the potential $f$ is $L$-smooth and $m$-strongly convex,\ni.e.\\ for sampling from a log-smooth and strongly log-concave target\ndistribution $\\pi$, it is known that under a constant integration time, the\nnumber of iterations that ideal HMC takes to get an $\\epsilon$ Wasserstein-2\ndistance to the target $\\pi$ is $O( \\kappa \\log \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} )$, where\n$\\kappa := \\frac{L}{m}$ is the condition number. We propose a scheme of\ntime-varying integration time based on the roots of Chebyshev polynomials. We\nshow that in the case of quadratic potential $f$, i.e., when the target $\\pi$\nis a Gaussian distribution, ideal HMC with this choice of integration time only\ntakes $O( \\sqrt{\\kappa} \\log \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} )$ number of iterations to\nreach Wasserstein-2 distance less than $\\epsilon$; this improvement on the\ndependence on condition number is akin to acceleration in optimization.

We\ninvestigate this problem by viewing the diffusion sampling process as a\nMetropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm, which helps reveal the underlying cause\nto be ill-conditioned curvature.

    "title": "Efficient Spatial-Temporal Information Fusion for LiDAR-Based 3D Moving  Object Segmentation",
    "abstract": "Accurate moving object segmentation is an essential task for autonomous\ndriving. It can provide effective information for many downstream tasks, such\nas collision avoidance, path planning, and static map construction. How to\neffectively exploit the spatial-temporal information is a critical question for\n3D LiDAR moving object segmentation (LiDAR-MOS). In this work, we propose a\nnovel deep neural network exploiting both spatial-temporal information and\ndifferent representation modalities of LiDAR scans to improve LiDAR-MOS\nperformance. Specifically, we first use a range image-based dual-branch\nstructure to separately deal with spatial and temporal information that can be\nobtained from sequential LiDAR scans, and later combine them using\nmotion-guided attention modules. We also use a point refinement module via 3D\nsparse convolution to fuse the information from both LiDAR range image and\npoint cloud representations and reduce the artifacts on the borders of the\nobjects. We verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach on the LiDAR-MOS\nbenchmark of SemanticKITTI. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods\nsignificantly in terms of LiDAR-MOS IoU. Benefiting from the devised\ncoarse-to-fine architecture, our method operates online at sensor frame rate.\nThe implementation of our method is available as open source at:\nhttps://github.com/haomo-ai/MotionSeg3D.",

    "abstract": "Bird's eye view (BEV) semantic segmentation plays a crucial role in spatial\nsensing for autonomous driving. Although recent literature has made significant\nprogress on BEV map understanding, they are all based on single-agent\ncamera-based systems which are difficult to handle occlusions and detect\ndistant objects in complex traffic scenes. Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V)\ncommunication technologies have enabled autonomous vehicles to share sensing\ninformation, which can dramatically improve the perception performance and\nrange as compared to single-agent systems. In this paper, we propose CoBEVT,\nthe first generic multi-agent multi-camera perception framework that can\ncooperatively generate BEV map predictions. To efficiently fuse camera features\nfrom multi-view and multi-agent data in an underlying Transformer architecture,\nwe design a fused axial attention or FAX module, which can capture sparsely\nlocal and global spatial interactions across views and agents. The extensive\nexperiments on the V2V perception dataset, OPV2V, demonstrate that CoBEVT\nachieves state-of-the-art performance for cooperative BEV semantic\nsegmentation. Moreover, CoBEVT is shown to be generalizable to other tasks,\nincluding 1) BEV segmentation with single-agent multi-camera and 2) 3D object\ndetection with multi-agent LiDAR systems, and achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance with real-time inference speed.",

    "abstract": "Since photorealistic faces can be readily generated by facial manipulation\ntechnologies nowadays, potential malicious abuse of these technologies has\ndrawn great concerns. Numerous deepfake detection methods are thus proposed.\nHowever, existing methods only focus on detecting one-step facial manipulation.\nAs the emergence of easy-accessible facial editing applications, people can\neasily manipulate facial components using multi-step operations in a sequential\nmanner. This new threat requires us to detect a sequence of facial\nmanipulations, which is vital for both detecting deepfake media and recovering\noriginal faces afterwards. Motivated by this observation, we emphasize the need\nand propose a novel research problem called Detecting Sequential DeepFake\nManipulation (Seq-DeepFake). Unlike the existing deepfake detection task only\ndemanding a binary label prediction, detecting Seq-DeepFake manipulation\nrequires correctly predicting a sequential vector of facial manipulation\noperations. To support a large-scale investigation, we construct the first\nSeq-DeepFake dataset, where face images are manipulated sequentially with\ncorresponding annotations of sequential facial manipulation vectors. Based on\nthis new dataset, we cast detecting Seq-DeepFake manipulation as a specific\nimage-to-sequence (e.g. image captioning) task and propose a concise yet\neffective Seq-DeepFake Transformer (SeqFakeFormer). Moreover, we build a\ncomprehensive benchmark and set up rigorous evaluation protocols and metrics\nfor this new research problem. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of SeqFakeFormer. Several valuable observations are also revealed\nto facilitate future research in broader deepfake detection problems.",

    "abstract": "Tumor segmentation is a fundamental step for radiotherapy treatment planning.\nTo define an accurate segmentation of the primary tumor (GTVp) of oropharyngeal\ncancer patients (OPC), simultaneous assessment of different image modalities is\nneeded, and each image volume is explored slice-by-slice from different\norientations. Moreover, the manual fixed boundary of segmentation neglects the\nspatial uncertainty known to occur in tumor delineation. This study proposes a\nnovel automatic deep learning (DL) model to assist radiation oncologists in a\nslice-by-slice adaptive GTVp segmentation on registered FDG PET/CT images. We\nincluded 138 OPC patients treated with (chemo)radiation in our institute. Our\nDL framework exploits both inter and intra-slice context. Sequences of 3\nconsecutive 2D slices of concatenated FDG PET/CT images and GTVp contours were\nused as input. A 3-fold cross validation was performed three times, training on\nsequences extracted from the Axial (A), Sagittal (S), and Coronal (C) plane of\n113 patients. Since consecutive sequences in a volume contain overlapping\nslices, each slice resulted in three outcome predictions that were averaged. In\nthe A, S, and C planes, the output shows areas with different probabilities of\npredicting the tumor. The performance of the models was assessed on 25 patients\nat different probability thresholds using the mean Dice Score Coefficient\n(DSC). Predictions were the closest to the ground truth at a probability\nthreshold of 0.9 (DSC of 0.70 in the A, 0.77 in the S, and 0.80 in the C\nplane). The promising results of the proposed DL model show that the\nprobability maps on registered FDG PET/CT images could guide radiation\noncologists in a slice-by-slice adaptive GTVp segmentation.",

    "abstract": "Random forests is one of the most widely used machine learning methods over\nthe past decade thanks to its outstanding empirical performance. Yet, because\nof its black-box nature, the results by random forests can be hard to interpret\nin many big data applications. Quantifying the usefulness of individual\nfeatures in random forests learning can greatly enhance its interpretability.\nExisting studies have shown that some popularly used feature importance\nmeasures for random forests suffer from the bias issue. In addition, there lack\ncomprehensive size and power analyses for most of these existing methods. In\nthis paper, we approach the problem via hypothesis testing, and suggest a\nframework of the self-normalized feature-residual correlation test (FACT) for\nevaluating the significance of a given feature in the random forests model with\nbias-resistance property, where our null hypothesis concerns whether the\nfeature is conditionally independent of the response given all other features.\nSuch an endeavor on random forests inference is empowered by some recent\ndevelopments on high-dimensional random forests consistency. The vanilla\nversion of our FACT test can suffer from the bias issue in the presence of\nfeature dependency. We exploit the techniques of imbalancing and conditioning\nfor bias correction. We further incorporate the ensemble idea into the FACT\nstatistic through feature transformations for the enhanced power. Under a\nfairly general high-dimensional nonparametric model setting with dependent\nfeatures, we formally establish that FACT can provide theoretically justified\nrandom forests feature p-values and enjoy appealing power through nonasymptotic\nanalyses. The theoretical results and finite-sample advantages of the newly\nsuggested method are illustrated with several simulation examples and an\neconomic forecasting application in relation to COVID-19.",

Following the Burer--Monteiro approach, we instead minimize\nthe nonconvex objective $f(X)=\\phi(XX^{T})$ over a factor matrix $X$ of size\n$n\\times r$. This substantially reduces the number of variables from $O(n^{2})$\nto as few as $O(n)$ and also enforces positive semidefiniteness for free, but\nat the cost of giving up the convexity of the original problem. In this paper,\nwe prove that if the search rank $r\\ge r^{\\star}$ is overparameterized by a\nconstant factor with respect to the true rank $r^{\\star}$, namely as in\n$r>\\frac{1}{4}(L/\\mu-1)^{2}r^{\\star}$, then despite nonconvexity, local\noptimization is guaranteed to globally converge from any initial point to the\nglobal optimum.

    "abstract": "Recent assertions of a potential advantage of Quantum Neural Network (QNN)\nfor specific Machine Learning (ML) tasks have sparked the curiosity of a\nsizable number of application researchers. The parameterized quantum circuit\n(PQC), a major building block of a QNN, consists of several layers of\nsingle-qubit rotations and multi-qubit entanglement operations. The optimum\nnumber of PQC layers for a particular ML task is generally unknown. A larger\nnetwork often provides better performance in noiseless simulations. However, it\nmay perform poorly on hardware compared to a shallower network. Because the\namount of noise varies amongst quantum devices, the optimal depth of PQC can\nvary significantly. Additionally, the gates chosen for the PQC may be suitable\nfor one type of hardware but not for another due to compilation overhead. This\nmakes it difficult to generalize a QNN design to wide range of hardware and\nnoise levels. An alternate approach is to build and train multiple QNN models\ntargeted for each hardware which can be expensive. To circumvent these issues,\nwe introduce the concept of knowledge distillation in QNN using approximate\nsynthesis. The proposed approach will create a new QNN network with (i) a\nreduced number of layers or (ii) a different gate set without having to train\nit from scratch. Training the new network for a few epochs can compensate for\nthe loss caused by approximation error.

    "abstract": "Traditional survey methods for finding surface resistivity are time-consuming\nand labor intensive. Very few studies have focused on finding the\nresistivity/conductivity using remote sensing data and deep learning\ntechniques. In this line of work, we assessed the correlation between surface\nresistivity and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) by applying various deep\nlearning methods and tested our hypothesis in the Coso Geothermal Area, USA.\nFor detecting the resistivity, L-band full polarimetric SAR data acquired by\nUAVSAR were used, and MT (Magnetotellurics) inverted resistivity data of the\narea were used as the ground truth. We conducted experiments to compare various\ndeep learning architectures and suggest the use of Dual Input UNet (DI-UNet)\narchitecture. DI-UNet uses a deep learning architecture to predict the\nresistivity using full polarimetric SAR data by promising a quick survey\naddition to the traditional method. Our proposed approach accomplished improved\noutcomes for the mapping of MT resistivity from SAR data.",

    "abstract": "The acquisition of the channel covariance matrix is of paramount importance\nto many strategies in multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) communications,\nsuch as the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) channel estimation. Therefore,\nplenty of efficient channel covariance matrix estimation schemes have been\nproposed in the literature. However, an abrupt change in the channel covariance\nmatrix may happen occasionally in practice due to the change in the scattering\nenvironment and the user location. Our paper aims to adopt the classic change\ndetection theory to detect the change in the channel covariance matrix as\naccurately and quickly as possible such that the new covariance matrix can be\nre-estimated in time. Specifically, this paper first considers the technique of\non-line change detection (also known as quickest/sequential change detection),\nwhere we need to detect whether a change in the channel covariance matrix\noccurs at each channel coherence time interval. Next, because the complexity of\ndetecting the change in a high-dimension covariance matrix at each coherence\ntime interval is too high, we devise a low-complexity off-line strategy in\nmassive MIMO systems, where change detection is merely performed at the last\nchannel coherence time interval of a given time period. Numerical results show\nthat our proposed on-line and off-line schemes can detect the channel\ncovariance change with a small delay and a low false alarm rate. Therefore, our\npaper theoretically and numerically verifies the feasibility of detecting the\nchannel covariance change accurately and quickly in practice.",

Segmentation is a fundamental limiting\nprecursor to diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Advances in Machine\nLearning (ML) aim to increase diagnostic efficiency to replace single\napplication with generalized algorithms.

Looking for anomalous regions in\nmedical images is one of the main applications that use anomaly segmentation.\nThe restricted receptive field in CNNs limit the CNN to model the global\ncontext and hence if the anomalous regions cover parts of the image, the\nCNN-based AEs are not capable to bring semantic understanding of the image.

Given two metastable\nconformational states of a molecular system, eg. a folded and unfolded protein,\nwe aim to sample the most likely transition path between the two states.\nSampling such a transition path is computationally expensive due to the\nexistence of high free energy barriers between the two states. To circumvent\nthis, previous work has focused on simplifying the trajectories to occur along\nspecific molecular descriptors called Collective Variables (CVs). However,\nfinding CVs is not trivial and requires chemical intuition. For larger\nmolecules, where intuition is not sufficient, using these CV-based methods\nbiases the transition along possibly irrelevant dimensions. Instead, this work\nproposes a method for sampling transition paths that consider the entire\ngeometry of the molecules.

    "title": "Learning Dynamic Graphs, Too Slow",
    "abstract": "The structure of knowledge is commonly described as a network of key concepts\nand semantic relations between them. A learner of a particular domain can\ndiscover this network by navigating the nodes and edges presented by\ninstructional material, such as a textbook, workbook, or other text. While over\na long temporal period such exploration processes are certain to discover the\nwhole connected network, little is known about how the learning is affected by\nthe dual pressures of finite study time and human mental errors. Here we model\nthe learning of linear algebra textbooks with finite length random walks over\nthe corresponding semantic networks. We show that if a learner does not keep up\nwith the pace of material presentation, the learning can be an order of\nmagnitude worse than it is in the asymptotic limit. Further, we find that this\nloss is compounded by three types of mental errors: forgetting, shuffling, and\nreinforcement. Broadly, our study informs the design of teaching materials from\nboth structural and temporal perspectives.",

    "title": "An Approximation Method for Fitted Random Forests",
    "abstract": "Random Forests (RF) is a popular machine learning method for classification\nand regression problems. It involves a bagging application to decision tree\nmodels. One of the primary advantages of the Random Forests model is the\nreduction in the variance of the forecast. In large scale applications of the\nmodel with millions of data points and hundreds of features, the size of the\nfitted objects can get very large and reach the limits on the available space\nin production setups, depending on the number and depth of the trees. This\ncould be especially challenging when trained models need to be downloaded\non-demand to small devices with limited memory. There is a need to approximate\nthe trained RF models to significantly reduce the model size without losing too\nmuch of prediction accuracy. In this project we study methods that approximate\neach fitted tree in the Random Forests model using the multinomial allocation\nof the data points to the leafs. Specifically, we begin by studying whether\nfitting a multinomial logistic regression (and subsequently, a generalized\nadditive model (GAM) extension) to the output of each tree helps reduce the\nsize while preserving the prediction quality.",
