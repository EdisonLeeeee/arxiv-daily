    "abstract": "The evolution of the mobile landscape is coupled with the ubiquitous nature\nof the Internet with its intermittent wireless connectivity and the web\nservices. Achieving the web service reliability results in low communication\noverhead and retrieving the appropriate response. The Middleware Approach (MA)\nis highly tended to achieve the web service reliability. This paper proposes a\nReliable Service Architecture using Middleware (RSAM) that achieves the\nreliable web services consumption. The enhanced architecture focuses on\nensuring and tracking the request execution under the communication limitations\nand service temporal unavailability. It considers the most measurement factors\nincluding: request size, response size, and consuming time. We conducted\nexperiments to compare the enhanced architecture with the traditional one that\nhas no additional overhead. In these experiments, we covered several cases to\nprove the achievement of reliability. Results also show that the request size\nwas found to be constant, the response size is identical to the traditional\narchitecture, and the increase in the consuming time was less than 5% of the\ntransaction time with the different response sizes.",

    "abstract": "To explore the vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs), many attack\nparadigms have been well studied, such as the poisoning-based backdoor attack\nin the training stage and the adversarial attack in the inference stage. In\nthis paper, we study a novel attack paradigm, which modifies model parameters\nin the deployment stage. Considering the effectiveness and stealthiness goals,\nwe provide a general formulation to perform the bit-flip based weight attack,\nwhere the effectiveness term could be customized depending on the attacker's\npurpose. Furthermore, we present two cases of the general formulation with\ndifferent malicious purposes, i.e., single sample attack (SSA) and triggered\nsamples attack (TSA). To this end, we formulate this problem as a mixed integer\nprogramming (MIP) to jointly determine the state of the binary bits (0 or 1) in\nthe memory and learn the sample modification. Utilizing the latest technique in\ninteger programming, we equivalently reformulate this MIP problem as a\ncontinuous optimization problem, which can be effectively and efficiently\nsolved using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method.\nConsequently, the flipped critical bits can be easily determined through\noptimization, rather than using a heuristic strategy. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the superiority of SSA and TSA in attacking DNNs.",

    "abstract": "Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide tool support to automate\nmany source code editing tasks. Traditionally, IDEs use only the spatial\ncontext, i.e., the location where the developer is editing, to generate\ncandidate edit recommendations. However, spatial context alone is often not\nsufficient to confidently predict the developer's next edit, and thus IDEs\ngenerate many suggestions at a location. Therefore, IDEs generally do not\nactively offer suggestions and instead, the developer is usually required to\nclick on a specific icon or menu and then select from a large list of potential\nsuggestions. As a consequence, developers often miss the opportunity to use the\ntool support because they are not aware it exists or forget to use it.\nTo better understand common patterns in developer behavior and produce better\nedit recommendations, we can additionally use the temporal context, i.e., the\nedits that a developer was recently performing. To enable edit recommendations\nbased on temporal context, we present Overwatch, a novel technique for learning\nedit sequence patterns from traces of developers' edits performed in an IDE.\nOur experiments show that Overwatch has 78% precision and that Overwatch not\nonly completed edits when developers missed the opportunity to use the IDE tool\nsupport but also predicted new edits that have no tool support in the IDE.",

    "abstract": "While ventricular electromechanics is extensively studied, four-chamber heart\nmodels have only been addressed recently; most of these works however neglect\natrial contraction. Indeed, as atria are characterized by a complex physiology\ninfluenced by the ventricular function, developing computational models able to\ncapture the physiological atrial function and atrioventricular interaction is\nvery challenging. In this paper, we propose a biophysically detailed\nelectromechanical model of the whole human heart that considers both atrial and\nventricular contraction. Our model includes: i) an anatomically accurate\nwhole-heart geometry; ii) a comprehensive myocardial fiber architecture; iii) a\nbiophysically detailed microscale model for the active force generation; iv) a\n0D closed-loop model of the circulatory system; v) the fundamental interactions\namong the different core models; vi) specific constitutive laws and model\nparameters for each cardiac region. Concerning the numerical discretization, we\npropose an efficient segregated-intergrid-staggered scheme and we employ\nrecently developed stabilization techniques that are crucial to obtain a stable\nformulation in a four-chamber scenario. We are able to reproduce the healthy\ncardiac function for all the heart chambers, in terms of pressure-volume loops,\ntime evolution of pressures, volumes and fluxes, and three-dimensional cardiac\ndeformation, with unprecedented matching (to the best of our knowledge) with\nthe expected physiology. We also show the importance of considering atrial\ncontraction, fibers-stretch-rate feedback and suitable stabilization\ntechniques, by comparing the results obtained with and without these features\nin the model. The proposed model represents the state-of-the-art\nelectromechanical model of the iHEART ERC project and is a fundamental step\ntoward the building of physics-based digital twins of the human heart.",

    "abstract": "Plasma is defined as the fourth state of matter and non-thermal plasma can be\nproduced at atmospheric pressure under a high electrical field. The strong and\nbroad-spectrum antimicrobial effect of plasma-activated liquids (PALs) is now\nwell known. The proven applicability of machine learning (ML) in the medical\nfield is encouraging for its application in the field of plasma medicine as\nwell. Thus, ML applications on PALs could present a new perspective to better\nunderstand the influences of various parameters on their antimicrobial effects.\nIn this paper, comparative supervised ML models are presented by using\npreviously obtained data to qualitatively predict the in vitro antimicrobial\nactivity of PALs. A literature search was performed and data is collected from\n33 relevant articles. After the required preprocessing steps, two supervised ML\nmethods, namely classification, and regression are applied to data to obtain\nmicrobial inactivation (MI) predictions. For classification, MI is labeled in\nfour categories and for regression, MI is used as a continuous variable. Two\ndifferent robust cross-validation strategies are conducted for classification\nand regression models to evaluate the proposed method; repeated stratified\nk-fold cross-validation and k-fold cross-validation, respectively. We also\ninvestigate the effect of different features on models. The results\ndemonstrated that the hyperparameter-optimized Random Forest Classifier (oRFC)\nand Random Forest Regressor (oRFR) provided better results than other models\nfor the classification and regression, respectively. Finally, the best test\naccuracy of 82.68% for oRFC and R2 of 0.75 for the oRFR are obtained. ML\ntechniques could contribute to a better understanding of plasma parameters that\nhave a dominant role in the desired antimicrobial effect.

Our technique allows a privacy-conscious data owner to run\npre-approved Oblivious Smart Contract code in their own environment on their\nown private data to produce Private Automated Certifications.

The non-linear dynamics of the human motion and\nthe changing of the surface parametrization over the time make this task very\nchallenging. To tackle this issue, we propose to embed the 3D shape sequences\nin an infinite dimensional space, the space of varifolds, endowed with an inner\nproduct that comes from a given positive definite kernel. More specifically,\nour approach involves two steps: 1) the surfaces are represented as varifolds,\nthis representation induces metrics equivariant to rigid motions and invariant\nto parametrization; 2) the sequences of 3D shapes are represented by Gram\nmatrices derived from their infinite dimensional Hankel matrices. The problem\nof comparison of two 3D sequences of human is formulated as a comparison of two\nGram-Hankel matrices.

In contrast to that, the policy that is not\nenvironmentally sustainable eventually enters stagnation. To further illustrate\nour findings, we compare the optimal periodic solution with a myopic one.\nInterestingly enough, the myopic solution yields higher overall payoff in the\nshort-run, but completely fails in the long-run, while the environmentally\nsustainable policy yields maximal payoff and preserves the environment over the\ninfinite time interval.",

    "abstract": "Datacenters suffer from resource utilization inefficiencies due to the\nconflicting goals of service owners and platform providers. Service owners\nintending to maintain Service Level Objectives (SLO) for themselves typically\nrequest a conservative amount of resources. Platform providers want to increase\noperational efficiency to reduce capital and operating costs. Achieving both\noperational efficiency and SLO for individual services at the same time is\nchallenging due to the diversity in service workload characteristics, resource\nusage patterns that are dependent on input load, heterogeneity in platform,\nmemory, I/O, and network architecture, and resource bundling.\nThis paper presents a tunable approach to resource allocation that accounts\nfor both dynamic service resource needs and platform heterogeneity. In\naddition, an online K-Means-based service classification method is used in\nconjunction with an offline sensitivity component. Our tunable approach allows\ntrading resource utilization efficiency for absolute SLO guarantees based on\nthe service owners' sensitivity to its SLO. We evaluate our tunable resource\nallocator at scale in a private cloud environment with mostly latency-critical\nworkloads. When tuning for operational efficiency, we demonstrate up to ~50%\nreduction in required machines; ~40% reduction in Total-Cost-of-Ownership\n(TCO); and ~60% reduction in CPU and memory fragmentation, but at the cost of\nincreasing the number of tasks experiencing degradation of SLO by up to ~25%\ncompared to the baseline. When tuning for SLO, by introducing\ninterference-aware colocation, we can tune the solver to reduce tasks\nexperiencing degradation of SLO by up to ~22% compared to the baseline, but at\nan additional cost of ~30% in terms of the number of hosts.

    "abstract": "With the continuous growth of the global economy and markets, resource\nimbalance has risen to be one of the central issues in real logistic scenarios.\nIn marine transportation, this trade imbalance leads to Empty Container\nRepositioning (ECR) problems. Once the freight has been delivered from an\nexporting country to an importing one, the laden will turn into empty\ncontainers that need to be repositioned to satisfy new goods requests in\nexporting countries. In such problems, the performance that any cooperative\nrepositioning policy can achieve strictly depends on the routes that vessels\nwill follow (i.e., fleet deployment). Historically, Operation Research (OR)\napproaches were proposed to jointly optimize the repositioning policy along\nwith the fleet of vessels. However, the stochasticity of future supply and\ndemand of containers, together with black-box and non-linear constraints that\nare present within the environment, make these approaches unsuitable for these\nscenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, Configurable\nSemi-POMDPs, to model this type of problems. Furthermore, we provide a\ntwo-stage learning algorithm, \"Configure & Conquer\" (CC), that first configures\nthe environment by finding an approximation of the optimal fleet deployment\nstrategy, and then \"conquers\" it by learning an ECR policy in this tuned\nenvironmental setting. We validate our approach in large and real-world\ninstances of the problem. Our experiments highlight that CC avoids the pitfalls\nof OR methods and that it is successful at optimizing both the ECR policy and\nthe fleet of vessels, leading to superior performance in world trade\nenvironments.",

    "abstract": "The study of distribution testing has become ubiquitous in the area of\nproperty testing, both for its theoretical appeal, as well as for its\napplications in other fields of Computer Science as well as in various\nreal-life statistical tasks.\nThe original distribution testing model relies on samples drawn independently\nfrom the distribution to be tested. However, when testing distributions over\nthe $n$-dimensional Hamming cube $\\left\\{0,1\\right\\}^{n}$ for a large $n$, even\nreading a few samples is infeasible. To address this, Goldreich and Ron [ITCS\n2022] have defined a model called the \\emph{huge object model}, in which the\nsamples may only be queried in a few places.\nIn this work, we initiate a study of a general class of huge object model\nproperties, those that are invariant under a permutation of the indices of the\nvectors in $\\left\\{0,1\\right\\}^{n}$, while still not being necessarily fully\nsymmetric as per the definition used in traditional distribution testing.\nIn particular, we prove that every index-invariant property satisfying a\nbounded VC-dimension restriction admits a property tester with a number of\nqueries independent of $n$. To complement this result, we argue that satisfying\nonly index-variance or only a VC-dimension bound is insufficient to guarantee a\ntest whose query complexity is independent of $n$. We also touch upon the\nquestion of the number of queries required for non-adaptive testing, showing\nthat it can be at most quadratic in the number of queries required for an\nadaptive tester. This is in contrast with the tight (easily provable)\nexponential gap between adaptive and non-adaptive testers for general\nnon-index-invariant properties.",

    "abstract": "Several recent works empirically find finetuning learning rate is critical to\nthe final performance in neural network structured pruning. Further researches\nfind that the network trainability broken by pruning answers for it, thus\ncalling for an urgent need to recover trainability before finetuning. Existing\nattempts propose to exploit weight orthogonalization to achieve dynamical\nisometry for improved trainability. However, they only work for linear MLP\nnetworks. How to develop a filter pruning method that maintains or recovers\ntrainability and is scalable to modern deep networks remains elusive. In this\npaper, we present trainability preserving pruning (TPP), a regularization-based\nstructured pruning method that can effectively maintain trainability during\nsparsification. Specifically, TPP regularizes the gram matrix of convolutional\nkernels so as to de-correlate the pruned filters from the kept filters. Beside\nthe convolutional layers, we also propose to regularize the BN parameters for\nbetter preserving trainability. Empirically, TPP can compete with the\nground-truth dynamical isometry recovery method on linear MLP networks. On\nnon-linear networks (ResNet56/VGG19, CIFAR datasets), it outperforms the other\ncounterpart solutions by a large margin. Moreover, TPP can also work\neffectively with modern deep networks (ResNets) on ImageNet, delivering\nencouraging performance in comparison to many top-performing filter pruning\nmethods. To our best knowledge, this is the first approach that effectively\nmaintains trainability during pruning for the large-scale deep neural networks.",

State-of-the-art SSL methods can achieve\ncomparable performance to supervised learning by leveraging much fewer labeled\ndata. However, most existing works focus on improving the performance of SSL.\nIn this work, we take a different angle by studying the training data privacy\nof SSL. Specifically, we propose the first data augmentation-based membership\ninference attacks against ML models trained by SSL. Given a data sample and the\nblack-box access to a model, the goal of membership inference attack is to\ndetermine whether the data sample belongs to the training dataset of the model.\nOur evaluation shows that the proposed attack can consistently outperform\nexisting membership inference attacks and achieves the best performance against\nthe model trained by SSL. Moreover, we uncover that the reason for membership\nleakage in SSL is different from the commonly believed one in supervised\nlearning, i.e., overfitting (the gap between training and testing accuracy). We\nobserve that the SSL model is well generalized to the testing data (with almost\n0 overfitting) but ''memorizes'' the training data by giving a more confident\nprediction regardless of its correctness. We also explore early stopping as a\ncountermeasure to prevent membership inference attacks against SSL.

Here we extend these methods by adding a multitude of electrodes\nto detect elliptical and occluded lumen and obtain EIT images to localise\ndeformations. Using a 14 Fr (5.3 mm) catheter as an example, numerical\nsimulations were performed to find the optimal electrode configuration of two\nrings of 8 electrodes spaced 10 mm apart. The simulations predicted that the\nmaximum detectable aspect ratio decreased from 0.9 for a 14mm balloon to 0.5 at\n30mm. The sizing and ellipticity detection results were verified\nexperimentally. A prototype robotic balloon catheter was constructed to\nautomatically inflate a compliant balloon while simultaneously recording EIT\nand pressure data.

We introduce $p$-DkNN, a novel inference procedure that\ntakes a trained deep neural network and analyzes the similarity structures of\nits intermediate hidden representations to compute $p$-values associated with\nthe end-to-end model prediction. The intuition is that statistical tests\nperformed on latent representations can serve not only as a classifier, but\nalso offer a statistically well-founded estimation of uncertainty. $p$-DkNN is\nscalable and leverages the composition of representations learned by hidden\nlayers, which makes deep representation learning successful. Our theoretical\nanalysis builds on Neyman-Pearson classification and connects it to recent\nadvances in selective classification (reject option). We demonstrate\nadvantageous trade-offs between abstaining from predicting on OOD inputs and\nmaintaining high accuracy on in-distribution inputs. We find that $p$-DkNN\nforces adaptive attackers crafting adversarial examples, a form of worst-case\nOOD inputs, to introduce semantically meaningful changes to the inputs.",

    "abstract": "Robotic harvesting of strawberries has gained much interest in the recent\npast. Although there are many innovations, they haven't yet reached a level\nthat is comparable to an expert human picker. The end effector unit plays a\nmajor role in defining the efficiency of such a robotic harvesting system. Even\nthough there are reports on various end effectors for strawberry harvesting,\nbut there they lack a picture of certain parameters that the researchers can\nrely upon to develop new end effectors. These parameters include the limit of\ngripping force that can be applied on the peduncle for effective gripping, the\nforce required to cut the strawberry peduncle, etc. These estimations would be\nhelpful in the design cycle of the end effectors that target to grip and cut\nthe strawberry peduncle during the harvesting action. This paper studies the\nestimation and analysis of these parameters experimentally. It has been\nestimated that the peduncle gripping force can be limited to 10 N. This enables\nan end effector to grip a strawberry of mass up to 50 grams with a manipulation\nacceleration of 50 m/s$^2$ without squeezing the peduncle. The study on\npeduncle cutting force reveals that a force of 15 N is sufficient to cut a\nstrawberry peduncle using a blade with a wedge angle of 16.6 degrees at a\n30-degree orientation.",

In this paper, we\npropose a deep learning-based inter-frame encoding scheme for dynamic point\ncloud geometry compression. We propose a lossy geometry compression scheme that\npredicts the latent representation of the current frame using the previous\nframe by employing a novel prediction network. Our proposed network utilizes\nsparse convolutions with hierarchical multiscale 3D feature learning to encode\nthe current frame using the previous frame. We employ convolution on target\ncoordinates to map the latent representation of the previous frame to the\ndownsampled coordinates of the current frame to predict the current frame's\nfeature embedding. Our framework transmits the residual of the predicted\nfeatures and the actual features by compressing them using a learned\nprobabilistic factorized entropy model. At the receiver, the decoder\nhierarchically reconstructs the current frame by progressively rescaling the\nfeature embedding. We compared our model to the state-of-the-art Video-based\nPoint Cloud Compression (V-PCC) and Geometry-based Point Cloud Compression\n(G-PCC) schemes standardized by the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG).

    "abstract": "Sensor data and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication can greatly assist\nConnected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) in situational awareness and provide a\nsafer driving experience. While sensor data recorded from devices such as radar\nand camera can assist in local awareness in the close vicinity of the Host\nVehicle (HV), the information obtained is useful solely for the HV itself. On\nthe other hand, V2X communication can allow CAVs to communicate with each other\nand transceive basic and/or advanced safety information, allowing each CAV to\ncreate a sophisticated local object map for situational awareness. This paper\nintroduces a point-to-point Driver Messenger System (DMS) that regularly\nmaintains a local object map of the HV and uses it to convey HV's Over-the-Air\n(OTA) Driver Intent Messages (DIMs) to nearby identified Target Vehicle(s)\n(TV(s)) based on a list of pre-defined common traffic applications. The focus\nof this paper is on the lane change application where DMS can use the local\nobject map to automatically identify closest TV in adjacent lane in the\ndirection of HV's intended lane change and inform the TV via a DIM. Within DMS,\nthe paper proposes a TV recognition algorithm for lane change application that\nutilizes the HV's Path History (PH) to accurately determine the closest TV that\ncould potentially benefit from receiving a DIM from HV. Finally, DMS is also\nshown to act as an advanced warning system by providing extra time and space\nheadway measurements between the HV and TVs upon a number of simulated lane\nchange scenarios.",

    "abstract": "While vision-and-language models perform well on tasks such as visual\nquestion answering, they struggle when it comes to basic human commonsense\nreasoning skills. In this work, we introduce WinoGAViL: an online game to\ncollect vision-and-language associations, (e.g., werewolves to a full moon),\nused as a dynamic benchmark to evaluate state-of-the-art models. Inspired by\nthe popular card game Codenames, a spymaster gives a textual cue related to\nseveral visual candidates, and another player has to identify them. Human\nplayers are rewarded for creating associations that are challenging for a rival\nAI model but still solvable by other human players. We use the game to collect\n3.5K instances, finding that they are intuitive for humans (>90% Jaccard index)\nbut challenging for state-of-the-art AI models, where the best model (ViLT)\nachieves a score of 52%, succeeding mostly where the cue is visually salient.\nOur analysis as well as the feedback we collect from players indicate that the\ncollected associations require diverse reasoning skills, including general\nknowledge, common sense, abstraction, and more. We release the dataset, the\ncode and the interactive game, aiming to allow future data collection that can\nbe used to develop models with better association abilities.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) has gained tremendous popularity in\nrecent years because of its high image quality performance and wide application\nscenarios. However, prior methods typically suffer from large amounts of\ncomputations and huge power consumption, causing difficulties for real-time\ninference, especially on resource-limited platforms such as mobile devices. To\nmitigate this, we propose a compiler-aware SR neural architecture search (NAS)\nframework that conducts depth search and per-layer width search with adaptive\nSR blocks. The inference speed is directly taken into the optimization along\nwith the SR loss to derive SR models with high image quality while satisfying\nthe real-time inference requirement. Instead of measuring the speed on mobile\ndevices at each iteration during the search process, a speed model incorporated\nwith compiler optimizations is leveraged to predict the inference latency of\nthe SR block with various width configurations for faster convergence. With the\nproposed framework, we achieve real-time SR inference for implementing 720p\nresolution with competitive SR performance (in terms of PSNR and SSIM) on\nGPU/DSP of mobile platforms (Samsung Galaxy S21).",

    "abstract": "Visual relocalization has been a widely discussed problem in 3D vision: given\na pre-constructed 3D visual map, the 6 DoF (Degrees-of-Freedom) pose of a query\nimage is estimated. Relocalization in large-scale indoor environments enables\nattractive applications such as augmented reality and robot navigation.\nHowever, appearance changes fast in such environments when the camera moves,\nwhich is challenging for the relocalization system. To address this problem, we\npropose a virtual view synthesis-based approach, RenderNet, to enrich the\ndatabase and refine poses regarding this particular scenario. Instead of\nrendering real images which requires high-quality 3D models, we opt to directly\nrender the needed global and local features of virtual viewpoints and apply\nthem in the subsequent image retrieval and feature matching operations\nrespectively.

    "abstract": "The rapid introduction of mobile navigation aides that use real-time road\nnetwork information to suggest alternate routes to drivers is making it more\ndifficult for researchers and government transportation agencies to understand\nand predict the dynamics of congested transportation systems. Computer\nsimulation is a key capability for these organizations to analyze hypothetical\nscenarios; however, the complexity of transportation systems makes it\nchallenging for them to simulate very large geographical regions, such as\nmulti-city metropolitan areas. In this paper, we describe the Mobiliti traffic\nsimulator, which includes mechanisms to capture congestion delays, timing\nconstraints, and link storage capacity constraints. The simulator is designed\nto support distributed memory parallel execution and be scalable on\nhigh-performance computing platforms. We introduce a method to model dynamic\nrerouting behavior with the addition of vehicle controller actors and reroute\nrequest events. We demonstrate the potential of the simulator by analyzing the\nimpact of varying the population penetration rate of dynamic rerouting on the\nSan Francisco Bay Area road network. Using high-performance parallel computing,\nwe can simulate a day of the San Francisco Bay Area with 19 million vehicle\ntrips with 50 percent dynamic rerouting penetration over a road network with\n0.5 million nodes and 1 million links in less than three minutes. We present an\nanalysis of system-level impacts when changing the dynamic rerouting\npenetration rate and examine the varying effects on different functional\nclasses and geographical regions. Finally, we present a validation of the\nsimulation results compared to real world data.",

Studying the aspects of\ncreation, diffusion and amplification also overlooks how misinformation is\ninternalized by users on social media and thus is quick to prescribe\n\"inoculation\" strategies for the presumed lack of immunity to misinformation.\nHow users grapple with social media content to develop \"natural immunity\" as a\nprecursor to misinformation resilience remains an open question. We have\nidentified at least five folk models that conceptualize misinformation as\neither: political (counter)argumentation, out-of-context narratives, inherently\nfallacious information, external propaganda, or simply entertainment.

Classifier guidance combines the score estimate of a\ndiffusion model with the gradient of an image classifier and thereby requires\ntraining an image classifier separate from the diffusion model. It also raises\nthe question of whether guidance can be performed without a classifier. We show\nthat guidance can be indeed performed by a pure generative model without such a\nclassifier: in what we call classifier-free guidance, we jointly train a\nconditional and an unconditional diffusion model, and we combine the resulting\nconditional and unconditional score estimates to attain a trade-off between\nsample quality and diversity similar to that obtained using classifier\nguidance.",

    "abstract": "We consider representation learning for proteins with 3D structures. We build\n3D graphs based on protein structures and develop graph networks to learn their\nrepresentations. Depending on the levels of details that we wish to capture,\nprotein representations can be computed at different levels, \\emph{e.g.}, the\namino acid, backbone, or all-atom levels. Importantly, there exist hierarchical\nrelations among different levels. In this work, we propose to develop a novel\nhierarchical graph network, known as ProNet, to capture the relations. Our\nProNet is very flexible and can be used to compute protein representations at\ndifferent levels of granularity. We show that, given a base 3D graph network\nthat is complete, our ProNet representations are also complete at all levels.\nTo close the loop, we develop a complete and efficient 3D graph network to be\nused as a base model, making our ProNet complete. We conduct experiments on\nmultiple downstream tasks. Results show that ProNet outperforms recent methods\non most datasets.

    "title": "Multi-Attention Network for Compressed Video Referring Object  Segmentation",
    "abstract": "Referring video object segmentation aims to segment the object referred by a\ngiven language expression. Existing works typically require compressed video\nbitstream to be decoded to RGB frames before being segmented, which increases\ncomputation and storage requirements and ultimately slows the inference down.\nThis may hamper its application in real-world computing resource limited\nscenarios, such as autonomous cars and drones. To alleviate this problem, in\nthis paper, we explore the referring object segmentation task on compressed\nvideos, namely on the original video data flow. Besides the inherent difficulty\nof the video referring object segmentation task itself, obtaining\ndiscriminative representation from compressed video is also rather challenging.\nTo address this problem, we propose a multi-attention network which consists of\ndual-path dual-attention module and a query-based cross-modal Transformer\nmodule. Specifically, the dual-path dual-attention module is designed to\nextract effective representation from compressed data in three modalities,\ni.e., I-frame, Motion Vector and Residual. The query-based cross-modal\nTransformer firstly models the correlation between linguistic and visual\nmodalities, and then the fused multi-modality features are used to guide object\nqueries to generate a content-aware dynamic kernel and to predict final\nsegmentation masks. Different from previous works, we propose to learn just one\nkernel, which thus removes the complicated post mask-matching procedure of\nexisting methods. Extensive promising experimental results on three challenging\ndatasets show the effectiveness of our method compared against several\nstate-of-the-art methods which are proposed for processing RGB data.

    "abstract": "Numerical schemes for wave-like systems with small dissipation are often\ninaccurate and unstable due to truncation errors and numerical roundoff errors.\nHence, numerical simulations of wave-like systems lacking proper handling of\nthese numerical issues often fail to represent the physical characteristics of\nwave phenomena. This challenge gets even more intricate for multiscale\nmodelling, especially in multiple dimensions. When using the usual collocated\ngrid, about two-thirds of the resolved wave modes are incorrect with\nsignificant dispersion. But, numerical schemes on staggered grids (with\nalternating variable arrangement) are significantly less dispersive and\npreserve much of the wave characteristics. Also, the group velocity of the\nenergy propagation in the numerical waves on a staggered grid is in the correct\ndirection, in contrast to the collocated grid. For high accuracy and to\npreserve much of the wave characteristics, this article extends the concept of\nstaggered grids in full-domain modelling to multidimensional multiscale\nmodelling. Specifically, this article develops 120 multiscale staggered grids\nand demonstrates their stability, accuracy, and wave-preserving characteristic\nfor equation-free multiscale modelling of weakly damped linear waves. But most\ncharacteristics of the developed multiscale staggered grids must also hold in\ngeneral for multiscale modelling of many complex spatio-temporal physical\nphenomena such as the general computational fluid dynamics.",

In the first step, we design\nan association representation model between the different modality\nrepresentations and semantic label representation separately, and use the\nsemantic label representation as an intermediate bridge to solve the semantic\ngap existing between different modalities. In addition, we present an efficient\ndiscrete optimization algorithm for solving the quantization error problem\ncaused by relaxation-based optimization algorithms.

    "abstract": "Bundle recommender systems recommend sets of items (e.g., pants, shirt, and\nshoes) to users, but they often suffer from two issues: significant interaction\nsparsity and a large output space. In this work, we extend multi-round\nconversational recommendation (MCR) to alleviate these issues. MCR, which uses\na conversational paradigm to elicit user interests by asking user preferences\non tags (e.g., categories or attributes) and handling user feedback across\nmultiple rounds, is an emerging recommendation setting to acquire user feedback\nand narrow down the output space, but has not been explored in the context of\nbundle recommendation. In this work, we propose a novel recommendation task\nnamed Bundle MCR. We first propose a new framework to formulate Bundle MCR as\nMarkov Decision Processes (MDPs) with multiple agents, for user modeling,\nconsultation and feedback handling in bundle contexts. Under this framework, we\npropose a model architecture, called Bundle Bert (Bunt) to (1) recommend items,\n(2) post questions and (3) manage conversations based on bundle-aware\nconversation states. Moreover, to train Bunt effectively, we propose a\ntwo-stage training strategy.

    "abstract": "Label hierarchies are often available apriori as part of biological taxonomy\nor language datasets WordNet. Several works exploit these to learn hierarchy\naware features in order to improve the classifier to make semantically\nmeaningful mistakes while maintaining or reducing the overall error. In this\npaper, we propose a novel approach for learning Hierarchy Aware Features (HAF)\nthat leverages classifiers at each level of the hierarchy that are constrained\nto generate predictions consistent with the label hierarchy. The classifiers\nare trained by minimizing a Jensen-Shannon Divergence with target soft labels\nobtained from the fine-grained classifiers. Additionally, we employ a simple\ngeometric loss that constrains the feature space geometry to capture the\nsemantic structure of the label space. HAF is a training time approach that\nimproves the mistakes while maintaining top-1 error, thereby, addressing the\nproblem of cross-entropy loss that treats all mistakes as equal. We evaluate\nHAF on three hierarchical datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results on the\niNaturalist-19 and CIFAR-100 datasets. The source code is available at\nhttps://github.com/07Agarg/HAF",

    "abstract": "Existing visual question answering methods tend to capture the spurious\ncorrelations from visual and linguistic modalities, and fail to discover the\ntrue casual mechanism that facilitates reasoning truthfully based on the\ndominant visual evidence and the correct question intention. Additionally, the\nexisting methods usually ignore the complex event-level understanding in\nmulti-modal settings that requires a strong cognitive capability of causal\ninference to jointly model cross-modal event temporality, causality, and\ndynamics. In this work, we focus on event-level visual question answering from\na new perspective, i.e., cross-modal causal relational reasoning, by\nintroducing causal intervention methods to mitigate the spurious correlations\nand discover the true causal structures for the integration of visual and\nlinguistic modalities. Specifically, we propose a novel event-level visual\nquestion answering framework named Cross-Modal Causal RelatIonal Reasoning\n(CMCIR), to achieve robust casuality-aware visual-linguistic question\nanswering. To uncover the causal structures for visual and linguistic\nmodalities, the novel Causality-aware Visual-Linguistic Reasoning (CVLR) module\nis proposed to collaboratively disentangle the visual and linguistic spurious\ncorrelations via elaborately designed front-door and back-door causal\nintervention modules. To discover the fine-grained interactions between\nlinguistic semantics and spatial-temporal representations, we build a novel\nSpatial-Temporal Transformer (STT) that builds the multi-modal co-occurrence\ninteractions between visual and linguistic content.

    "abstract": "Cross-modal hashing is a successful method to solve large-scale multimedia\nretrieval issue. A lot of matrix factorization-based hashing methods are\nproposed. However, the existing methods still struggle with a few problems,\nsuch as how to generate the binary codes efficiently rather than directly relax\nthem to continuity. In addition, most of the existing methods choose to use an\n$n\\times n$ similarity matrix for optimization, which makes the memory and\ncomputation unaffordable. In this paper we propose a novel Asymmetric Scalable\nCross-Modal Hashing (ASCMH) to address these issues. It firstly introduces a\ncollective matrix factorization to learn a common latent space from the\nkernelized features of different modalities, and then transforms the similarity\nmatrix optimization to a distance-distance difference problem minimization with\nthe help of semantic labels and common latent space. Hence, the computational\ncomplexity of the $n\\times n$ asymmetric optimization is relieved. In the\ngeneration of hash codes we also employ an orthogonal constraint of label\ninformation, which is indispensable for search accuracy. So the redundancy of\ncomputation can be much reduced. For efficient optimization and scalable to\nlarge-scale datasets, we adopt the two-step approach rather than optimizing\nsimultaneously.

However, conventional XRF-based pigment\nidentification relies on time-consuming elemental mapping by expert\ninterpretations of measured spectra. To reduce the reliance on manual work,\nrecent studies have applied machine learning techniques to cluster similar XRF\nspectra in data analysis and to identify the most likely pigments.\nNevertheless, it is still challenging for automatic pigment identification\nstrategies to directly tackle the complex structure of real paintings, e.g.\npigment mixtures and layered pigments. In addition, pixel-wise pigment\nidentification based on XRF imaging remains an obstacle due to the high noise\nlevel compared with averaged spectra. Therefore, we developed a\ndeep-learning-based end-to-end pigment identification framework to fully\nautomate the pigment identification process. In particular, it offers high\nsensitivity to the underlying pigments and to the pigments with a low\nconcentration, therefore enabling satisfying results in mapping the pigments\nbased on single-pixel XRF spectrum. As case studies, we applied our framework\nto lab-prepared mock-up paintings and two 19th-century paintings: Paul\nGauguin's Po\\`emes Barbares (1896) that contains layered pigments with an\nunderlying painting, and Paul Cezanne's The Bathers (1899-1904).

In dynamic graph scenarios, we usually need\nto measure the structural entropy of the updated graph at any given time.\nHowever, the current structural entropy methods do not support the efficient\nincremental updating of an encoding tree. To address this issue, we propose a\nnovel incremental measurement method of structural entropy for dynamic graphs.\nFirst, we present two new dynamic adjustment strategies for one- and\ntwo-dimensional encoding trees. Second, we propose a new metric, namely Global\nInvariant, to approximate the updated structural entropy in the computational\ncomplexity of O(1). Besides, we define another metric, namely Local Difference,\nas the difference between the updated structural entropy and the Global\nInvariant, whose computational complexity is O(n). Third, new efficient\nincremental algorithms, Incre-1dSE and Incre-2dSE, are designed for computing\nthe updated one- and two-dimensional structural entropy. Furthermore, we\ntheoretically prove that the Local Difference and its first-order absolute\nmoment converge to 0 in order of O(log m/m).

To reduce the dependence on large supervision, semi-supervised\nlearning (SSL) based approaches have been proposed.

In\nthis work, we propose a new Pseudo-Labeling framework for semi-supervised 3D\nobject detection, by enhancing the teacher model to a proficient one with\nseveral necessary designs.

Second, to improve the precision of recalled boxes, a Clusteringbased\nBox Voting (CBV) module is designed to get aggregated votes from the clustered\nseed boxes. This also eliminates the necessity of sophisticated thresholds to\nselect pseudo labels. Furthermore, to reduce the negative influence of wrongly\npseudo-labeled samples during the training, a soft supervision signal is\nproposed by considering Box-wise Contrastive Learning (BCL).

Although existing studies\nhave developed unbiased learning methods using inverse propensity weighting\n(IPW) or causal reasoning, they solely focus on eliminating the popularity bias\nof items. In this paper, we propose a novel unbiased recommender learning\nmodel, namely BIlateral SElf-unbiased Recommender (BISER), to eliminate the\nexposure bias of items caused by recommender models. Specifically, BISER\nconsists of two key components: (i) self-inverse propensity weighting (SIPW) to\ngradually mitigate the bias of items without incurring high computational\ncosts; and (ii) bilateral unbiased learning (BU) to bridge the gap between two\ncomplementary models in model predictions, i.e., user- and item-based\nautoencoders, alleviating the high variance of SIPW. Extensive experiments show\nthat BISER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unbiased recommender\nmodels over several datasets, including Coat, Yahoo! R3, MovieLens, and\nCiteULike.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale multi-modal contrastive pre-training has demonstrated great\nutility to learn transferable features for a range of downstream tasks by\nmapping multiple modalities into a shared embedding space. Typically, this has\nemployed separate encoders for each modality. However, recent work suggests\nthat transformers can support learning across multiple modalities and allow\nknowledge sharing. Inspired by this, we investigate a variety of\nModality-Shared Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (MS-CLIP) frameworks.\nMore specifically, we question how many parameters of a transformer model can\nbe shared across modalities during contrastive pre-training, and rigorously\nexamine architectural design choices that position the proportion of parameters\nshared along a spectrum. In studied conditions, we observe that a mostly\nunified encoder for vision and language signals outperforms all other\nvariations that separate more parameters. Additionally, we find that\nlight-weight modality-specific parallel modules further improve performance.\nExperimental results show that the proposed MS-CLIP approach outperforms\nvanilla CLIP by up to 13\\% relative in zero-shot ImageNet classification\n(pre-trained on YFCC-100M), while simultaneously supporting a reduction of\nparameters. In addition, our approach outperforms vanilla CLIP by 1.6 points in\nlinear probing on a collection of 24 downstream vision tasks. Furthermore, we\ndiscover that sharing parameters leads to semantic concepts from different\nmodalities being encoded more closely in the embedding space, facilitating the\ntransferring of common semantic structure (e.g., attention patterns) from\nlanguage to vision.

    "abstract": "Recent findings (e.g., arXiv:2103.00065) demonstrate that modern neural\nnetworks trained by full-batch gradient descent typically enter a regime called\nEdge of Stability (EOS). In this regime, the sharpness, i.e., the maximum\nHessian eigenvalue, first increases to the value 2/(step size) (the progressive\nsharpening phase) and then oscillates around this value (the EOS phase). This\npaper aims to analyze the GD dynamics and the sharpness along the optimization\ntrajectory. Our analysis naturally divides the GD trajectory into four phases\ndepending on the change of the sharpness. We empirically identify the norm of\noutput layer weight as an interesting indicator of sharpness dynamics. Based on\nthis empirical observation, we attempt to theoretically and empirically explain\nthe dynamics of various key quantities that lead to the change of sharpness in\neach phase of EOS. Moreover, based on certain assumptions, we provide a\ntheoretical proof of the sharpness behavior in EOS regime in two-layer\nfully-connected linear neural networks.

To determine whether\nthis approach is appropriate for children of this age we wanted to know: do\nchildren understand state diagrams, do they understand the role of\nreachability, and are they engaged by them? We found that they are able to\ntranslate between different representations of state diagrams, strongly\nindicating that they do understand them.

It also can provide other benefits like having\nnon-blocking operators which will produce data steadily (without bursts), or\noperators with reduced memory footprint.\nSorting may be required on any step of query processing, i.e., be it source\ndata or intermediate results. At the same time, the data to be sorted may not\nfit into main memory. In this case, an external sort operator, which writes\nintermediate results to disk, should be used.\nIn this paper we consider an external sort operator of the comparison-based\nsort type. We discuss its implementation and describe related design decisions.\nOur aim is to study the impact on performance of a data structure used on the\nmerge step. For this, we have experimentally evaluated three data structures\nimplemented inside a DBMS.\nResults have shown that it is worthwhile to make an effort to implement an\nefficient data structure for run merging, even on modern commodity computers\nwhich are usually disk-bound.

For\nmulti-view camera-only 3D detection, methods based on bird-eye-view or 3D\ngeometric representations can leverage the stereo cues from overlapped regions\nbetween adjacent views and directly perform 3D detection without hand-crafted\npost-processing. However, it lacks direct semantic supervision for 2D\nbackbones, which can be complemented by pretraining simple monocular-based\ndetectors. Our solution is a multi-view framework for 4D detection following\nthis paradigm. It is built upon a simple monocular detector FCOS3D++,\npretrained only with object annotations of Waymo, and converts multi-view\nfeatures to a 3D grid space to detect 3D objects thereon. A dual-path neck for\nsingle-frame understanding and temporal stereo matching is devised to\nincorporate multi-frame information. Our method finally achieves 49.75% mAPL\nwith a single model and wins 2nd place in the WOD challenge, without any\nLiDAR-based depth supervision during training.

In this paper, we propose a\nnetwork architecture that achieves human-level accuracy in assigning bias\nclassifications to articles. The underlying model is based on a novel Mesh\nNeural Network (MNN),this structure enables feedback and feedforward synaptic\nconnections between any two neurons in the mesh. The MNN ontains six network\nconfigurations that utilize Bernoulli based random sampling, pre-trained DNNs,\nand a network modelled after the C. Elegans nematode. The model is trained on\nover ten-thousand articles scraped from AllSides.com which are labelled to\nindicate political bias. The parameters of the network are then evolved using a\ngenetic algorithm suited to the feedback neural structure. Finally, the best\nperforming model is applied to five popular news sources in the United States\nover a fifty-day trial to quantify political biases in the articles they\ndisplay.

    "title": "On the Interaction between Test-Suite Reduction and Regression-Test  Selection Strategies",
    "abstract": "Unit testing is one of the most established quality-assurance techniques for\nsoftware development. One major advantage of unit testing is the adjustable\ntrade-off between efficiency (i.e., testing effort) and effectiveness (i.e.,\nfault-detection probability). To this end, various strategies have been\nproposed to exploit this trade-off. In particular, test-suite reduction (TSR)\nreduces the number of (presumably redundant) test cases while testing a single\nprogram version. Regression-test selection (RTS) selects test cases for testing\nconsecutive program revisions. However, both TSR and RTS may influence -- or\neven obstruct -- each others' performance when used in combination. For\ninstance, test cases discarded during TSR for a particular program version may\nbecome relevant again for RTS. However, finding a combination of both\nstrategies leading to a reasonable trade-off throughout the version history of\na program is an open question. The goal of this paper is to gain a better\nunderstanding of the interactions between TSR and RTS with respect to\nefficiency and effectiveness. To this end, we present a configurable framework\ncalled RegreTS for automated unit-testing of C programs. The framework\ncomprises different strategies for TSR and RTS and possible combinations\nthereof. We apply this framework to a collection of subject systems, delivering\nseveral crucial insights. First, TSR has almost always a negative impact on the\neffectiveness of RTS, yet a positive impact on efficiency. Second, test cases\nrevealing to testers the effect of program modifications between consecutive\nprogram versions are far more effective than test cases simply covering\nmodified code parts, yet causing much more testing effort.",

Therefore, general-purpose and customizable\nvolume visualization and processing systems have to provide out-of-core\nmechanisms that allow for handling and analyzing such data. Voreen is an\nopen-source rapid-prototyping framework that was originally designed to quickly\ncreate custom visualization applications for volumetric imaging data using the\nmeanwhile quite common data flow graph paradigm. In recent years, Voreen has\nbeen used in various interdisciplinary research projects with an increasing\ndemand for large data processing capabilities without relying on cluster\ncompute resources.

Process discovery, the most prominent category of process\nmining techniques, aims to discover process models from event logs, however, it\nleads to spaghetti models when working with real-life data. Therefore, several\nclustering techniques have been proposed on top of traditional event logs\n(i.e., event logs with a single case notion) to reduce the complexity of\nprocess models and discover homogeneous subsets of cases. Nevertheless, in\nreal-life processes, particularly in the context of Business-to-Business (B2B)\nprocesses, multiple objects are involved in a process. Recently, Object-Centric\nEvent Logs (OCELs) have been introduced to capture the information of such\nprocesses, and several process discovery techniques have been developed on top\nof OCELs. Yet, the output of the proposed discovery techniques on real OCELs\nleads to more informative but also more complex models. In this paper, we\npropose a clustering-based approach to cluster similar objects in OCELs to\nsimplify the obtained process models.

    "abstract": "Real-scene image super-resolution aims to restore real-world low-resolution\nimages into their high-quality versions. A typical RealSR framework usually\nincludes the optimization of multiple criteria which are designed for different\nimage properties, by making the implicit assumption that the ground-truth\nimages can provide a good trade-off between different criteria. However, this\nassumption could be easily violated in practice due to the inherent contrastive\nrelationship between different image properties. Contrastive learning (CL)\nprovides a promising recipe to relieve this problem by learning discriminative\nfeatures using the triplet contrastive losses. Though CL has achieved\nsignificant success in many computer vision tasks, it is non-trivial to\nintroduce CL to RealSR due to the difficulty in defining valid positive image\npairs in this case. Inspired by the observation that the contrastive\nrelationship could also exist between the criteria, in this work, we propose a\nnovel training paradigm for RealSR, named Criteria Comparative Learning\n(Cria-CL), by developing contrastive losses defined on criteria instead of\nimage patches. In addition, a spatial projector is proposed to obtain a good\nview for Cria-CL in RealSR. Our experiments demonstrate that compared with the\ntypical weighted regression strategy, our method achieves a significant\nimprovement under similar parameter settings.",

    "abstract": "Video Question Answering (VideoQA) is the task of answering the natural\nlanguage questions about a video. Producing an answer requires understanding\nthe interplay across visual scenes in video and linguistic semantics in\nquestion. However, most leading VideoQA models work as black boxes, which make\nthe visual-linguistic alignment behind the answering process obscure. Such\nblack-box nature calls for visual explainability that reveals ``What part of\nthe video should the model look at to answer the question?''. Only a few works\npresent the visual explanations in a post-hoc fashion, which emulates the\ntarget model's answering process via an additional method. Nonetheless, the\nemulation struggles to faithfully exhibit the visual-linguistic alignment\nduring answering.\nInstead of post-hoc explainability, we focus on intrinsic interpretability to\nmake the answering process transparent. At its core is grounding the\nquestion-critical cues as the causal scene to yield answers, while rolling out\nthe question-irrelevant information as the environment scene. Taking a causal\nlook at VideoQA, we devise a self-interpretable framework, Equivariant and\nInvariant Grounding for Interpretable VideoQA (EIGV). Specifically, the\nequivariant grounding encourages the answering to be sensitive to the semantic\nchanges in the causal scene and question; in contrast, the invariant grounding\nenforces the answering to be insensitive to the changes in the environment\nscene. By imposing them on the answering process, EIGV is able to distinguish\nthe causal scene from the environment information, and explicitly present the\nvisual-linguistic alignment. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets\njustify the superiority of EIGV in terms of accuracy and visual\ninterpretability over the leading baselines.",

    "abstract": "A quantitative understanding of dynamic lane-changing (LC) interaction\npatterns is indispensable for improving the decision-making of autonomous\nvehicles, especially in mixed traffic with human-driven vehicles. This paper\ndevelops a novel framework combining the hidden Markov model and graph\nstructure to identify the difference in dynamic interaction networks between\nmandatory lane changes (MLC) and discretionary lane changes (DLC). A hidden\nMarkov model is developed to decompose LC interactions into homogenous segments\nand reveal the temporal properties of these segments. Then, conditional mutual\ninformation is used to quantify the interaction intensity, and the graph\nstructure is used to characterize the connectivity between vehicles. Finally,\nthe critical vehicle in each dynamic interaction network is identified. Based\non the LC events extracted from the INTERACTION dataset, the proposed\nanalytical framework is applied to modeling MLC and DLC under congested traffic\nwith levels of service E and F. The results show that there are multiple\nheterogeneous dynamic interaction network structures in an LC process. A\ncomparison of MLC and DLC demonstrates that MLC are more complex, while DLC are\nmore random. The complexity of MLC is attributed to the intense interaction and\nfrequent transition of the interaction network structure, while the random DLC\ndemonstrate no obvious evolution rules and dominant vehicles in interaction\nnetworks. The findings in this study are useful for understanding the\nconnectivity structure between vehicles in LC interactions, and for designing\nappropriate and well-directed driving decision-making models for autonomous\nvehicles and advanced driver-assistance systems.",

    "abstract": "With the increases in computational power and advances in machine learning,\ndata-driven learning-based methods have gained significant attention in solving\nPDEs. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently emerged and\nsucceeded in various forward and inverse PDEs problems thanks to their\nexcellent properties, such as flexibility, mesh-free solutions, and\nunsupervised training. However, their slower convergence speed and relatively\ninaccurate solutions often limit their broader applicability in many science\nand engineering domains. This paper proposes a new kind of data-driven PDEs\nsolver, physics-informed cell representations (PIXEL), elegantly combining\nclassical numerical methods and learning-based approaches. We adopt a grid\nstructure from the numerical methods to improve accuracy and convergence speed\nand overcome the spectral bias presented in PINNs. Moreover, the proposed\nmethod enjoys the same benefits in PINNs, e.g., using the same optimization\nframeworks to solve both forward and inverse PDE problems and readily enforcing\nPDE constraints with modern automatic differentiation techniques. We provide\nexperimental results on various challenging PDEs that the original PINNs have\nstruggled with and show that PIXEL achieves fast convergence speed and high\naccuracy.",

The addition of locks simplifies the\nformulation of typing rules for calculi that incorporate different modal\naxioms, but each variant demands different, tedious and seemingly ad hoc\nsyntactic lemmas to prove normalization.

Although\nthese methods all ensure the balance in sample quantity, the quality of the\naugmented samples is not always satisfactory for recognition, being prone to\nsuch problems as over-fitting, lack of diversity, semantic drift, etc. For\nthese issues, we propose the Class-aware Universum Inspired Re-balance\nLearning(CaUIRL) for long-tailed recognition, which endows the Universum with\nclass-aware ability to re-balance individual minority classes from both sample\nquantity and quality. In particular, we theoretically prove that the\nclassifiers learned by CaUIRL are consistent with those learned under the\nbalanced condition from a Bayesian perspective. In addition, we further develop\na higher-order mixup approach, which can automatically generate class-aware\nUniversum(CaU) data without resorting to any external data. Unlike the\ntraditional Universum, such generated Universum additionally takes the domain\nsimilarity, class separability, and sample diversity into account.

One such\nvulnerability that has been well studied is model extraction: a phenomenon in\nwhich the attacker attempts to steal a victim's model by training a surrogate\nmodel to mimic the decision boundaries of the victim model. Previous works have\ndemonstrated the effectiveness of such an attack and its devastating\nconsequences, but much of this work has been done primarily for image and text\nprocessing tasks. Our work is the first attempt to perform model extraction on\n{\\em audio classification models}. We are motivated by an attacker whose goal\nis to mimic the behavior of the victim's model trained to identify a speaker.\nThis is particularly problematic in security-sensitive domains such as\nbiometric authentication. We find that prior model extraction techniques, where\nthe attacker \\textit{naively} uses a proxy dataset to attack a potential\nvictim's model, fail. We therefore propose the use of a generative model to\ncreate a sufficiently large and diverse pool of synthetic attack queries. We\nfind that our approach is able to extract a victim's model trained on\n\\texttt{LibriSpeech} using queries synthesized with a proxy dataset based off\nof \\texttt{VoxCeleb}; we achieve a test accuracy of 84.41\\% with a budget of 3\nmillion queries.",

While computer vision has made\nimpressive progress in low-level tasks like head and body pose estimation, the\ndetection of more subtle behaviors such as gesturing, grooming, or fumbling is\nnot well explored. In this paper we present BBSI, the first set of annotations\nof complex Bodily Behaviors embedded in continuous Social Interactions in a\ngroup setting.

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art deep neural networks are still struggling to address the\ncatastrophic forgetting problem in continual learning. In this paper, we\npropose one simple paradigm (named as S-Prompting) and two concrete approaches\nto highly reduce the forgetting degree in one of the most typical continual\nlearning scenarios, i.e., domain increment learning (DIL). The key idea of the\nparadigm is to learn prompts independently across domains with pre-trained\ntransformers, avoiding the use of exemplars that commonly appear in\nconventional methods. This results in a win-win game where the prompting can\nachieve the best for each domain. The independent prompting across domains only\nrequests one single cross-entropy loss for training and one simple K-NN\noperation as a domain identifier for inference. The learning paradigm derives\nan image prompt learning approach and a brand-new language-image prompt\nlearning approach. Owning an excellent scalability (0.03% parameter increase\nper domain), the best of our approaches achieves a remarkable relative\nimprovement (an average of about 30%) over the best of the state-of-the-art\nexemplar-free methods for three standard DIL tasks, and even surpasses the best\nof them relatively by about 6% in average when they use exemplars.",

    "abstract": "Synthesizing natural interactions between virtual humans and their 3D\nenvironments is critical for numerous applications, such as computer games and\nAR/VR experiences. Our goal is to synthesize humans interacting with a given 3D\nscene controlled by high-level semantic specifications as pairs of action\ncategories and object instances, e.g., \"sit on the chair\". The key challenge of\nincorporating interaction semantics into the generation framework is to learn a\njoint representation that effectively captures heterogeneous information,\nincluding human body articulation, 3D object geometry, and the intent of the\ninteraction. To address this challenge, we design a novel transformer-based\ngenerative model, in which the articulated 3D human body surface points and 3D\nobjects are jointly encoded in a unified latent space, and the semantics of the\ninteraction between the human and objects are embedded via positional encoding.\nFurthermore, inspired by the compositional nature of interactions that humans\ncan simultaneously interact with multiple objects, we define interaction\nsemantics as the composition of varying numbers of atomic action-object pairs.\nOur proposed generative model can naturally incorporate varying numbers of\natomic interactions, which enables synthesizing compositional human-scene\ninteractions without requiring composite interaction data. We extend the PROX\ndataset with interaction semantic labels and scene instance segmentation to\nevaluate our method and demonstrate that our method can generate realistic\nhuman-scene interactions with semantic control. Our perceptual study shows that\nour synthesized virtual humans can naturally interact with 3D scenes,\nconsiderably outperforming existing methods.

In this research, we conducted a qualitative interview study among\ndashboard creators from federal agencies, state health departments, mainstream\nnews media outlets, and other organizations that created (often widely-used)\nCOVID-19 dashboards to answer the following questions: how did visualization\ncreators engage in COVID-19 dashboard design, and what tensions, conflicts, and\nchallenges arose during this process?

In this paper, a multimodal guidance approach\n(Multimodal-GuideNet) is proposed to capture the stepwise dependency between a\nreal-world US video signal, synchronized gaze, and probe motion within a\nunified framework. To understand the causal relationship between gaze movement\nand probe motion, our model exploits multitask learning to jointly learn two\nrelated tasks: predicting gaze movements and probe signals that an experienced\nsonographer would perform in routine obstetric scanning. The two tasks are\nassociated by a modality-aware spatial graph to detect the co-occurrence among\nthe multi-modality inputs and share useful cross-modal information. Instead of\na deterministic scanning path, Multimodal-GuideNet allows for scanning\ndiversity by estimating the probability distribution of real scans. Experiments\nperformed with three typical obstetric scanning examinations show that the new\napproach outperforms single-task learning for both probe motion guidance and\ngaze movement prediction. Multimodal-GuideNet also provides a visual guidance\nsignal with an error rate of less than 10 pixels for a 224x288 US image.",

To this end, we introduce the notation of adaptive monotonicity ratio\n$m\\in[0,1]$ to measure the degree of monotonicity of a function. Our main\nresult is to show that a random greedy policy achieves an approximation ratio\nof $m(1-1/e)+(1-m)(1/e)$ if the utility function is $m$-adaptive monotone and\nadaptive submodular. Notably this result recovers the aforementioned $(1-1/e)$\nand $1/e$ approximation ratios when $m = 0$ and $m = 1$, respectively. We\nfurther extend our results to consider a knapsack constraint. We show that a\nsampling-based policy achieves an approximation ratio of $(m+1)/10$ if the\nutility function is $m$-adaptive monotone and adaptive submodular. One\nimportant implication of our results is that even for a non-monotone utility\nfunction, we still can achieve an approximation ratio close to $(1-1/e)$ if\nthis function is ``close'' to a monotone function. This leads to improved\nperformance bounds for many machine learning applications whose utility\nfunctions are almost adaptive monotone.",

    "abstract": "Computer vision/deep learning-based 3D human pose estimation methods aim to\nlocalize human joints from images and videos. Pose representation is normally\nlimited to 3D joint positional/translational degrees of freedom (3DOFs),\nhowever, a further three rotational DOFs (6DOFs) are required for many\npotential biomechanical applications. Positional DOFs are insufficient to\nanalytically solve for joint rotational DOFs in a 3D human skeletal model.\nTherefore, we propose a temporal inverse kinematics (IK) optimization technique\nto infer joint orientations throughout a biomechanically informed, and\nsubject-specific kinematic chain. For this, we prescribe link directions from a\nposition-based 3D pose estimate. Sequential least squares quadratic programming\nis used to solve a minimization problem that involves both frame-based pose\nterms, and a temporal term. The solution space is constrained using joint DOFs,\nand ranges of motion (ROMs). We generate 3D pose motion sequences to assess the\nIK approach both for general accuracy, and accuracy in boundary cases. Our\ntemporal algorithm achieves 6DOF pose estimates with low Mean Per Joint Angular\nSeparation (MPJAS) errors (3.7{\\deg}/joint overall, & 1.6{\\deg}/joint for lower\nlimbs). With frame-by-frame IK we obtain low errors in the case of bent elbows\nand knees, however, motion sequences with phases of extended/straight limbs\nresults in ambiguity in twist angle. With temporal IK, we reduce ambiguity for\nthese poses, resulting in lower average errors.",

    "abstract": "In software development teams, developer turnover is among the primary\nreasons for project failures as it leads to a great void of knowledge and\nstrain for the newcomers. Unfortunately, no established methods exist to\nmeasure how knowledge is distributed among development teams. Knowing how this\nknowledge evolves and is owned by key developers in a project helps managers\nreduce risks caused by turnover. To this end, this paper introduces a novel,\nrealistic representation of domain knowledge distribution: the ConceptRealm. To\nconstruct the ConceptRealm, we employ a latent Dirichlet allocation model to\nrepresent textual features obtained from 300k issues and 1.3M comments from 518\nopen-source projects. We analyze whether the newly emerged issues and\ndevelopers share similar concepts or how aligned the developers' concepts are\nwith the team over time. We also investigate the impact of leaving members on\nthe frequency of concepts. Finally, we evaluate the soundness of our approach\nto closed-source software, thus allowing the validation of the results from a\npractical standpoint. We find out that the ConceptRealm can represent the\nhigh-level domain knowledge within a team and can be utilized to predict the\nalignment of developers with issues. We also observe that projects exhibit many\nkeepers independent of project maturity and that abruptly leaving keepers harm\nthe team's concept familiarity.",

    "abstract": "A central challenge in the computational modeling and simulation of a\nmultitude of science applications is to achieve robust and accurate closures\nfor their coarse-grained representations due to underlying highly nonlinear\nmultiscale interactions. These closure models are common in many nonlinear\nspatiotemporal systems to account for losses due to reduced order\nrepresentations, including many transport phenomena in fluids. Previous\ndata-driven closure modeling efforts have mostly focused on supervised learning\napproaches using high fidelity simulation data. On the other hand,\nreinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful yet relatively uncharted method in\nspatiotemporally extended systems. In this study, we put forth a modular\ndynamic closure modeling and discovery framework to stabilize the Galerkin\nprojection based reduced order models that may arise in many nonlinear\nspatiotemporal dynamical systems with quadratic nonlinearity. However, a key\nelement in creating a robust RL agent is to introduce a feasible reward\nfunction, which can be constituted of any difference metrics between the RL\nmodel and high fidelity simulation data. First, we introduce a multi-modal RL\n(MMRL) to discover mode-dependant closure policies that utilize the high\nfidelity data in rewarding our RL agent. We then formulate a variational\nmultiscale RL (VMRL) approach to discover closure models without requiring\naccess to the high fidelity data in designing the reward function.\nSpecifically, our chief innovation is to leverage variational multiscale\nformalism to quantify the difference between modal interactions in Galerkin\nsystems. Our results in simulating the viscous Burgers equation indicate that\nthe proposed VMRL method leads to robust and accurate closure\nparameterizations, and it may potentially be used to discover scale-aware\nclosure models for complex dynamical systems.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a method for visually explaining the decision-making\nprocess of 3D convolutional neural networks (CNN) with a temporal extension of\nocclusion sensitivity analysis. The key idea here is to occlude a specific\nvolume of data by a 3D mask in an input 3D temporal-spatial data space and then\nmeasure the change degree in the output score. The occluded volume data that\nproduces a larger change degree is regarded as a more critical element for\nclassification. However, while the occlusion sensitivity analysis is commonly\nused to analyze single image classification, it is not so straightforward to\napply this idea to video classification as a simple fixed cuboid cannot deal\nwith the motions. To this end, we adapt the shape of a 3D occlusion mask to\ncomplicated motions of target objects. Our flexible mask adaptation is\nperformed by considering the temporal continuity and spatial co-occurrence of\nthe optical flows extracted from the input video data. We further propose to\napproximate our method by using the first-order partial derivative of the score\nwith respect to an input image to reduce its computational cost.

In this paper, we study the coexistence of over-the-air FL and\ntraditional information transfer (IT) in a mobile edge network. We propose a\ncoexisting federated learning and information transfer (CFLIT) communication\nframework, where the FL and IT devices share the wireless spectrum in an OFDM\nsystem. Under this framework, we aim to maximize the IT data rate and guarantee\na given FL convergence performance by optimizing the long-term radio resource\nallocation. A key challenge that limits the spectrum efficiency of the\ncoexisting system lies in the large overhead incurred by frequent communication\nbetween the server and edge devices for FL model aggregation. To address the\nchallenge, we rigorously analyze the impact of the computation-to-communication\nratio on the convergence of over-the-air FL in wireless fading channels. The\nanalysis reveals the existence of an optimal computation-to-communication ratio\nthat minimizes the amount of radio resources needed for over-the-air FL to\nconverge to a given error tolerance.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a framework based on computer vision that can detect\nroad traffic crashes (RCTs) by using the installed surveillance/CCTV camera and\nreport them to the emergency in real-time with the exact location and time of\noccurrence of the accident. The framework is built of five modules. We start\nwith the detection of vehicles by using YOLO architecture; The second module is\nthe tracking of vehicles using MOSSE tracker, Then the third module is a new\napproach to detect accidents based on collision estimation. Then the fourth\nmodule for each vehicle, we detect if there is a car accident or not based on\nthe violent flow descriptor (ViF) followed by an SVM classifier for crash\nprediction. Finally, in the last stage, if there is a car accident, the system\nwill send a notification to the emergency by using a GPS module that provides\nus with the location, time, and date of the accident to be sent to the\nemergency with the help of the GSM module. The main objective is to achieve\nhigher accuracy with fewer false alarms and to implement a simple system based\non pipelining technique.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we consider the task of pairwise cross-modality image\nregistration, which may benefit from exploiting additional images available\nonly at training time from an additional modality that is different to those\nbeing registered. As an example, we focus on aligning intra-subject\nmultiparametric Magnetic Resonance (mpMR) images, between T2-weighted (T2w)\nscans and diffusion-weighted scans with high b-value (DWI$_{high-b}$). For the\napplication of localising tumours in mpMR images, diffusion scans with zero\nb-value (DWI$_{b=0}$) are considered easier to register to T2w due to the\navailability of corresponding features. We propose a learning from privileged\nmodality algorithm, using a training-only imaging modality DWI$_{b=0}$, to\nsupport the challenging multi-modality registration problems. We present\nexperimental results based on 369 sets of 3D multiparametric MRI images from\n356 prostate cancer patients and report, with statistical significance, a\nlowered median target registration error of 4.34 mm, when registering the\nholdout DWI$_{high-b}$ and T2w image pairs, compared with that of 7.96 mm\nbefore registration. Results also show that the proposed learning-based\nregistration networks enabled efficient registration with comparable or better\naccuracy, compared with a classical iterative algorithm and other tested\nlearning-based methods with/without the additional modality. These compared\nalgorithms also failed to produce any significantly improved alignment between\nDWI$_{high-b}$ and T2w in this challenging application.",

    "abstract": "The increase in use of online educational tools has led to a large amount of\neducational video materials made available for students. Finding the right\nvideo content is usually supported by the overarching learning management\nsystem and its interface that organises video items by course, categories and\nweeks, and makes them searchable. However, once a video is found, students are\nleft without further guidance as to what parts in that video they should focus\non. In this article, an additional timeline visualisation to augment the\nconventional playback timeline is introduced which employs a novel playback\nweighting strategy in which the history of different video interactions\ngenerate scores based on the context of each playback. The resultant scores are\npresented on the additional timeline, making it in effect a playback-centric\nusage graph nuanced by how each playback was executed. Students can selectively\nwatch those portions which the contour of the usage visualisation suggests. The\nvisualisation was implemented and deployed in an undergraduate course at a\nuniversity for two full semesters. 270 students used the system throughout both\nsemesters watching 52 videos, guided by visualisations on what to watch.\nAnalysis of playback logs revealed students selectively watched corresponding\nto the most important portions of the videos as assessed by the instructor who\ncreated the videos. The characteristics of this as a way of guiding students as\nto where to watch as well as a complementary tool for playback analysis, are\ndiscussed. Further insights into the potential values of this visualisation and\nits underlying playback weighting strategy are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Recent work achieved impressive progress towards joint reconstruction of\nhands and manipulated objects from monocular color images. Existing methods\nfocus on two alternative representations in terms of either parametric meshes\nor signed distance fields (SDFs). On one side, parametric models can benefit\nfrom prior knowledge at the cost of limited shape deformations and mesh\nresolutions. Mesh models, hence, may fail to precisely reconstruct details such\nas contact surfaces of hands and objects. SDF-based methods, on the other side,\ncan represent arbitrary details but are lacking explicit priors. In this work\nwe aim to improve SDF models using priors provided by parametric\nrepresentations. In particular, we propose a joint learning framework that\ndisentangles the pose and the shape. We obtain hand and object poses from\nparametric models and use them to align SDFs in 3D space. We show that such\naligned SDFs better focus on reconstructing shape details and improve\nreconstruction accuracy both for hands and objects.

    "abstract": "We propose a framework for speeding up maximum flow computation by using\npredictions. A prediction is a flow, i.e., an assignment of non-negative flow\nvalues to edges, which satisfies the flow conservation property, but does not\nnecessarily respect the edge capacities of the actual instance (since these\nwere unknown at the time of learning). We present an algorithm that, given an\n$m$-edge flow network and a predicted flow, computes a maximum flow in\n$O(m\\eta)$ time, where $\\eta$ is the $\\ell_1$ error of the prediction, i.e.,\nthe sum over the edges of the absolute difference between the predicted and\noptimal flow values. Moreover, we prove that, given an oracle access to a\ndistribution over flow networks, it is possible to efficiently PAC-learn a\nprediction minimizing the expected $\\ell_1$ error over that distribution. Our\nresults fit into the recent line of research on learning-augmented algorithms,\nwhich aims to improve over worst-case bounds of classical algorithms by using\npredictions, e.g., machine-learned from previous similar instances. So far, the\nmain focus in this area was on improving competitive ratios for online\nproblems. Following Dinitz et al.

    "abstract": "The density variation of smectic A liquid crystals is modelled by a\nfourth-order PDE, which exhibits two complications over the biharmonic or other\ntypical $H^2$-elliptic fourth-order problems. First, the equation involves a\n``Hessian-squared'' (div-div-grad-grad) operator, rather than a biharmonic\n(div-grad-div-grad) operator. Secondly, while positive-definite, the equation\nhas a ``wrong-sign'' shift, making it somewhat more akin to a Helmholtz\noperator, with lowest-energy modes arising from certain plane waves, than an\nelliptic one. In this paper, we analyze and compare three finite-element\nformulations for such PDEs, based on $H^2$-conforming elements, the $C^0$\ninterior penalty method, and a mixed finite-element formulation that explicitly\nintroduces approximations to the gradient of the solution and a Lagrange\nmultiplier. The conforming method is simple but is impractical to apply in\nthree dimensions; the interior-penalty method works well in two and three\ndimensions but has lower-order convergence and (in preliminary experiments)\nseems difficult to precondition; the mixed method uses more degrees of freedom,\nbut works well in both two and three dimensions, and is amenable to monolithic\nmultigrid preconditioning.

Typically, small objects appear\nin real-world due to large camera-object distance. Because small objects occupy\nonly a small area in the input image (e.g., less than 10%), the information\nextracted from such a small area is not always rich enough to support decision\nmaking. Multidisciplinary strategies are being developed by researchers working\nat the interface of deep learning and computer vision to enhance the\nperformance of SOD deep learning based methods.

This paper summarizes the\nexisting literature and provide a taxonomy that illustrates the broad picture\nof current research. We investigate how to improve the performance of small\nobject detection in maritime environments, where increasing performance is\ncritical. By establishing a connection between generic and maritime SOD\nresearch, future directions have been identified.

    "abstract": "Security is an essential requirement of Industrial Control System (ICS)\nenvironments and its underlying communication infrastructure. Especially the\nlowest communication level within Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition\n(SCADA) systems - the field level - commonly lacks security measures. Since\nemerging wireless technologies within field level expose the lowest\ncommunication infrastructure towards potential attackers, additional security\nmeasures above the prevalent concept of air-gapped communication must be\nconsidered. Therefore, this work analyzes security aspects for the wireless\ncommunication protocol IO-LinkWireless (IOLW), which is commonly used for\nsensor and actuator field level communication. A possible architecture for an\nIOLW safety layer has already been presented recently [1]. In this paper, the\noverall attack surface of IOLW within its typical environment is analyzed and\nattack preconditions are investigated to assess the effectiveness of different\nsecurity measures. Additionally, enhanced security measures are evaluated for\nthe communication systems and the results are summarized. Also, interference of\nsecurity measures and functional safety principles within the communication are\ninvestigated, which do not necessarily complement one another but may also have\ncontradictory requirements. This work is intended to discuss and propose\nenhancements of the IOLW standard with additional security considerations in\nfuture implementations.",

    "abstract": "Environmental perception is an important aspect within the field of\nautonomous vehicles that provides crucial information about the driving domain,\nincluding but not limited to identifying clear driving areas and surrounding\nobstacles. Semantic segmentation is a widely used perception method for\nself-driving cars that associates each pixel of an image with a predefined\nclass. In this context, several segmentation models are evaluated regarding\naccuracy and efficiency. Experimental results on the generated dataset confirm\nthat the segmentation model FasterSeg is fast enough to be used in realtime on\nlowpower computational (embedded) devices in self-driving cars. A simple method\nis also introduced to generate synthetic training data for the model. Moreover,\nthe accuracy of the first-person perspective and the bird's eye view\nperspective are compared.

To that end, natural\nlanguage processing can extract relevant information. Methods based on transfer\nlearning using pre-trained language models have achieved state-of-the-art\nresults in most NLP applications; however, publicly available models lack\nexposure to speciality-languages, especially in the medical field.\nObjective\nWe aimed to evaluate the impact of adapting a language model to French\nclinical reports on downstream medical NLP tasks.\nMethods\nWe leveraged a corpus of 21M clinical reports collected from August 2017 to\nJuly 2021 at the Greater Paris University Hospitals (APHP) to produce two\nCamemBERT architectures on speciality language: one retrained from scratch and\nthe other using CamemBERT as its initialisation.

    "abstract": "Typical methods for blind image super-resolution (SR) focus on dealing with\nunknown degradations by directly estimating them or learning the degradation\nrepresentations in a latent space. A potential limitation of these methods is\nthat they assume the unknown degradations can be simulated by the integration\nof various handcrafted degradations (e.g., bicubic downsampling), which is not\nnecessarily true. The real-world degradations can be beyond the simulation\nscope by the handcrafted degradations, which are referred to as novel\ndegradations. In this work, we propose to learn a latent representation space\nfor degradations, which can be generalized from handcrafted (base) degradations\nto novel degradations. The obtained representations for a novel degradation in\nthis latent space are then leveraged to generate degraded images consistent\nwith the novel degradation to compose paired training data for SR model.\nFurthermore, we perform variational inference to match the posterior of\ndegradations in latent representation space with a prior distribution (e.g.,\nGaussian distribution). Consequently, we are able to sample more high-quality\nrepresentations for a novel degradation to augment the training data for SR\nmodel. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world\ndatasets to validate the effectiveness and advantages of our method for blind\nsuper-resolution with novel degradations.",

This\nfundamental puzzle has intrigued scholars in many fields, including psychology,\nsociology, anthropology, and marketing. It has been theorized that cultural\nproducts that balance familiarity and novelty are more likely to become\npopular. However, a cultural product's novelty is typically multifaceted. This\npaper uses songs as a case study to study the multiple facets of uniqueness and\ntheir relationship with success. We first unpack the multiple facets of a\nsong's novelty or uniqueness and, next, measure its impact on a song's\npopularity. We employ a series of statistical models to study the relationship\nbetween a song's popularity and novelty associated with its lyrics, chord\nprogressions, or audio properties. Our analyses performed on a dataset of over\nfifty thousand songs find a consistently negative association between all types\nof song novelty and popularity. Overall we found a song's lyrics uniqueness to\nhave the most significant association with its popularity. However, audio\nuniqueness was the strongest predictor of a song's popularity, conditional on\nthe song's genre. We further found the theme and repetitiveness of a song's\nlyrics to mediate the relationship between the song's popularity and novelty.\nBroadly, our results contradict the ''optimal distinctiveness theory'' (balance\nbetween novelty and familiarity) and call for an investigation into the\nmultiple dimensions along which a cultural product's uniqueness could manifest.",

    "abstract": "Most existing scene text detectors focus on detecting characters or words\nthat only capture partial text messages due to missing contextual information.\nFor a better understanding of text in scenes, it is more desired to detect\ncontextual text blocks (CTBs) which consist of one or multiple integral text\nunits (e.g., characters, words, or phrases) in natural reading order and\ntransmit certain complete text messages. This paper presents contextual text\ndetection, a new setup that detects CTBs for better understanding of texts in\nscenes. We formulate the new setup by a dual detection task which first detects\nintegral text units and then groups them into a CTB. To this end, we design a\nnovel scene text clustering technique that treats integral text units as tokens\nand groups them (belonging to the same CTB) into an ordered token sequence. In\naddition, we create two datasets SCUT-CTW-Context and ReCTS-Context to\nfacilitate future research, where each CTB is well annotated by an ordered\nsequence of integral text units. Further, we introduce three metrics that\nmeasure contextual text detection in local accuracy, continuity, and global\naccuracy. Extensive experiments show that our method accurately detects CTBs\nwhich effectively facilitates downstream tasks such as text classification and\ntranslation.

However, features learned on old classes could significantly\ndrift, causing catastrophic forgetting. Moreover, few samples for pixel-level\nsegmentation on new classes lead to notorious overfitting issues in each\nlearning session. In this paper, we explicitly represent class-based knowledge\nfor semantic segmentation as a category embedding and a hyper-class embedding,\nwhere the former describes exclusive semantical properties, and the latter\nexpresses hyper-class knowledge as class-shared semantic properties. Aiming to\nsolve IFSS problems, we present EHNet, i.e., Embedding adaptive-update and\nHyper-class representation Network from two aspects. First, we propose an\nembedding adaptive-update strategy to avoid feature drift, which maintains old\nknowledge by hyper-class representation, and adaptively update category\nembeddings with a class-attention scheme to involve new classes learned in\nindividual sessions. Second, to resist overfitting issues caused by few\ntraining samples, a hyper-class embedding is learned by clustering all category\nembeddings for initialization and aligned with category embedding of the new\nclass for enhancement, where learned knowledge assists to learn new knowledge,\nthus alleviating performance dependence on training data scale.

However, the\noverhead during training is often overlooked, and yet reducing time and memory\noverhead during training is increasingly important in the giant models' era.\nThis paper proposes an efficient self-distillation method named Zipf's Label\nSmoothing (Zipf's LS), which uses the on-the-fly prediction of a network to\ngenerate soft supervision that conforms to Zipf distribution without using any\ncontrastive samples or auxiliary parameters. Our idea comes from an empirical\nobservation that when the network is duly trained the output values of a\nnetwork's final softmax layer, after sorting by the magnitude and averaged\nacross samples, should follow a distribution reminiscent to Zipf's Law in the\nword frequency statistics of natural languages. By enforcing this property on\nthe sample level and throughout the whole training period, we find that the\nprediction accuracy can be greatly improved. Using ResNet50 on the INAT21\nfine-grained classification dataset, our technique achieves +3.61% accuracy\ngain compared to the vanilla baseline, and 0.88% more gain against the previous\nlabel smoothing or self-distillation strategies.

    "abstract": "Explaining decisions made by deep neural networks is a rapidly advancing\nresearch topic. In recent years, several approaches have attempted to provide\nvisual explanations of decisions made by neural networks designed for\nstructured 2D image input data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to\ngenerate coarse visual explanations of networks designed to classify\nunstructured 3D data, namely point clouds. Our method uses gradients flowing\nback to the final feature map layers and maps these values as contributions of\nthe corresponding points in the input point cloud. Due to dimensionality\ndisagreement and lack of spatial consistency between input points and final\nfeature maps, our approach combines gradients with points dropping to compute\nexplanations of different parts of the point cloud iteratively. The generality\nof our approach is tested on various point cloud classification networks,\nincluding 'single object' networks PointNet, PointNet++, DGCNN, and a 'scene'\nnetwork VoteNet. Our method generates symmetric explanation maps that highlight\nimportant regions and provide insight into the decision-making process of\nnetwork architectures. We perform an exhaustive evaluation of trust and\ninterpretability of our explanation method against comparative approaches using\nquantitative, quantitative and human studies.

It is notably difficult as\na single image can not provide any clues for predicting absolute depth values.\nMotivated by binocular methods for 3D object detection, we take advantage of\nthe strong geometry structure provided by camera ego-motion for accurate object\ndepth estimation and detection. We first make a theoretical analysis on this\ngeneral two-view case and notice two challenges: 1) Cumulative errors from\nmultiple estimations that make the direct prediction intractable; 2) Inherent\ndilemmas caused by static cameras and matching ambiguity. Accordingly, we\nestablish the stereo correspondence with a geometry-aware cost volume as the\nalternative for depth estimation and further compensate it with monocular\nunderstanding to address the second problem. Our framework, named Depth from\nMotion (DfM), then uses the established geometry to lift 2D image features to\nthe 3D space and detects 3D objects thereon. We also present a pose-free DfM to\nmake it usable when the camera pose is unavailable. Our framework outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods by a large margin on the KITTI benchmark.

We\nmeasure the accuracy of the learned mixtures using transportation distance.\nPrevious algorithms either assume certain separation assumptions, use more\nrecovery moments, or run in (super) exponential time. Our algorithm for the\n1-dimension problem (also called the sparse Hausdorff moment problem) is a\nrobust version of the classic Prony's method, and our contribution mainly lies\nin the analysis. We adopt a global and much tighter analysis than previous work\n(which analyzes the perturbation of the intermediate results of Prony's\nmethod). A useful technical ingredient is a connection between the linear\nsystem defined by the Vandermonde matrix and the Schur polynomial, which allows\nus to provide tight perturbation bound independent of the separation and may be\nuseful in other contexts. To tackle the high dimensional problem, we first\nsolve the 2-dimensional problem by extending the 1-dimension algorithm and\nanalysis to complex numbers. Our algorithm for the high dimensional case\ndetermines the coordinates of each spike by aligning a 1-d projection of the\nmixture to a random vector and a set of 2d-projections of the mixture.

Adversarial training\n(AT) is frequently used to improve the robustness of DNNs, which can improve\nthe robustness in training a mixture of corrupted and clean data.

    "abstract": "The cross-resolution person re-identification (CRReID) problem aims to match\nlow-resolution (LR) query identity images against high resolution (HR) gallery\nimages. It is a challenging and practical problem since the query images often\nsuffer from resolution degradation due to the different capturing conditions\nfrom real-world cameras. To address this problem, state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nsolutions either learn the resolution-invariant representation or adopt\nsuper-resolution (SR) module to recover the missing information from the LR\nquery. This paper explores an alternative SR-free paradigm to directly compare\nHR and LR images via a dynamic metric, which is adaptive to the resolution of a\nquery image. We realize this idea by learning resolution-adaptive\nrepresentations for cross-resolution comparison. Specifically, we propose two\nresolution-adaptive mechanisms. The first one disentangles the\nresolution-specific information into different sub-vectors in the penultimate\nlayer of the deep neural networks, and thus creates a varying-length\nrepresentation. To better extract resolution-dependent information, we further\npropose to learn resolution-adaptive masks for intermediate residual feature\nblocks. A novel progressive learning strategy is proposed to train those masks\nproperly.

    "title": "Text-Guided Synthesis of Artistic Images with Retrieval-Augmented  Diffusion Models",
    "abstract": "Novel architectures have recently improved generative image synthesis leading\nto excellent visual quality in various tasks. Of particular note is the field\nof ``AI-Art'', which has seen unprecedented growth with the emergence of\npowerful multimodal models such as CLIP. By combining speech and image\nsynthesis models, so-called ``prompt-engineering'' has become established, in\nwhich carefully selected and composed sentences are used to achieve a certain\nvisual style in the synthesized image. In this note, we present an alternative\napproach based on retrieval-augmented diffusion models (RDMs). In RDMs, a set\nof nearest neighbors is retrieved from an external database during training for\neach training instance, and the diffusion model is conditioned on these\ninformative samples. During inference (sampling), we replace the retrieval\ndatabase with a more specialized database that contains, for example, only\nimages of a particular visual style. This provides a novel way to prompt a\ngeneral trained model after training and thereby specify a particular visual\nstyle. As shown by our experiments, this approach is superior to specifying the\nvisual style within the text prompt.

    "abstract": "Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a transmission technique\nthat uses several subcarrier frequencies (multicarrier) that are perpendicular\nto each other (orthogonal). This OFDM modulation technique effectively\neliminates Intersymbol Interference (ISI) on a channel caused by the effects of\nmultipath fading. To overcome this weakness, OFDM uses a guard interval (cyclic\nprefix) inserted in its transmission. This paper analyses the effect of\ndifferent cyclic prefix lengths on OFDM performance on multipath channels using\nMatlab. Here, the cyclic prefix length as the main parameter is varied for the\ndifferent number of subscribers. Meanwhile, Bit Error Rate (BER) and Signal\nNoise Ratio (SNR) values obtained at the receiver are used to see the system's\nperformance. Based on our simulation results, the best value of BER is obtained\nusing a cyclic prefix length of 1/4 with a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) size of\n512.",

    "abstract": "We introduce the problem of domain adaptation under Open Set Label Shift\n(OSLS) where the label distribution can change arbitrarily and a new class may\narrive during deployment, but the class-conditional distributions p(x|y) are\ndomain-invariant. OSLS subsumes domain adaptation under label shift and\nPositive-Unlabeled (PU) learning. The learner's goals here are two-fold: (a)\nestimate the target label distribution, including the novel class; and (b)\nlearn a target classifier. First, we establish necessary and sufficient\nconditions for identifying these quantities. Second, motivated by advances in\nlabel shift and PU learning, we propose practical methods for both tasks that\nleverage black-box predictors. Unlike typical Open Set Domain Adaptation (OSDA)\nproblems, which tend to be ill-posed and amenable only to heuristics, OSLS\noffers a well-posed problem amenable to more principled machinery. Experiments\nacross numerous semi-synthetic benchmarks on vision, language, and medical\ndatasets demonstrate that our methods consistently outperform OSDA baselines,\nachieving 10--25% improvements in target domain accuracy. Finally, we analyze\nthe proposed methods, establishing finite-sample convergence to the true label\nmarginal and convergence to optimal classifier for linear models in a Gaussian\nsetup.

    "abstract": "This paper considers a general framework for massive random access based on\nsparse superposition coding. We provide guidelines for the code design and\npropose the use of constant-weight codes in combination with a dictionary\ndesign based on Gabor frames. The decoder applies an extension of approximate\nmessage passing (AMP) by iteratively exchanging soft information between an AMP\nmodule that accounts for the dictionary structure, and a second inference\nmodule that utilizes the structure of the involved constant-weight code. We\napply the encoding structure to (i) the unsourced random access setting, where\nall users employ a common dictionary, and (ii) to the \"sourced\" random access\nsetting with user-specific dictionaries. When applied to a fading scenario, the\ncommunication scheme essentially operates non-coherently, as channel state\ninformation is required neither at the transmitter nor at the receiver. We\nobserve that in regimes of practical interest, the proposed scheme compares\nfavorably with state-of-the art schemes, in terms of the (per-user)\nenergy-per-bit requirement, as well as the number of active users that can be\nsimultaneously accommodated in the system.

This paper proposes a simple yet\neffective method based on a hybrid matching scheme that combines the original\none-to-one matching branch with auxiliary queries that use one-to-many matching\nloss during training. This hybrid strategy has been shown to significantly\nimprove training efficiency and improve accuracy. In inference, only the\noriginal one-to-one match branch is used, thus maintaining the end-to-end merit\nand the same inference efficiency of DETR. The method is named\n$\\mathcal{H}$-DETR, and it shows that a wide range of representative DETR\nmethods can be consistently improved across a wide range of visual tasks,\nincluding Deformable-DETR, 3DETR/PETRv2, PETR, and TransTrack, among others.\nCode will be available at: https://github.com/HDETR",

    "abstract": "We study off-policy evaluation (OPE) for partially observable MDPs (POMDPs)\nwith general function approximation. Existing methods such as sequential\nimportance sampling estimators and fitted-Q evaluation suffer from the curse of\nhorizon in POMDPs. To circumvent this problem, we develop a novel model-free\nOPE method by introducing future-dependent value functions that take future\nproxies as inputs. Future-dependent value functions play similar roles as\nclassical value functions in fully-observable MDPs. We derive a new Bellman\nequation for future-dependent value functions as conditional moment equations\nthat use history proxies as instrumental variables. We further propose a\nminimax learning method to learn future-dependent value functions using the new\nBellman equation. We obtain the PAC result, which implies our OPE estimator is\nconsistent as long as futures and histories contain sufficient information\nabout latent states, and the Bellman completeness. Finally, we extend our\nmethods to learning of dynamics and establish the connection between our\napproach and the well-known spectral learning methods in POMDPs.",

    "abstract": "Leveraging many sources of offline robot data requires grappling with the\nheterogeneity of such data. In this paper, we focus on one particular aspect of\nheterogeneity: learning from offline data collected at different control\nfrequencies. Across labs, the discretization of controllers, sampling rates of\nsensors, and demands of a task of interest may differ, giving rise to a mixture\nof frequencies in an aggregated dataset. We study how well offline\nreinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can accommodate data with a mixture of\nfrequencies during training. We observe that the $Q$-value propagates at\ndifferent rates for different discretizations, leading to a number of learning\nchallenges for off-the-shelf offline RL. We present a simple yet effective\nsolution that enforces consistency in the rate of $Q$-value updates to\nstabilize learning. By scaling the value of $N$ in $N$-step returns with the\ndiscretization size, we effectively balance $Q$-value propagation, leading to\nmore stable convergence.

However, flexible models come with many parameters that lack\nphysical motivation, making interpreting the implication of these models\nchallenging. In this work, we demonstrate symbolic regression can complement\nflexible models by distilling the posterior predictive distribution of such\nflexible models into interpretable analytic expressions. We recover common GW\npopulation models such as a power-law-plus-Gaussian, and find a new empirical\npopulation model which combines accuracy and simplicity.

I first show that,\nregardless the level of ambiguity and both in the case of a single individual\nor of a networked society, only two types of opinions might be formed and both\nare biased. One opinion type, however, is necessarily less biased than the\nother depending on the state of the world. The size of both biases depends on\nthe ambiguity level and the relative magnitude of the state and confirmation\nbiases. In this context, long-run learning is not attained even when\nindividuals interpret ambiguity impartially. Finally, since it is not trivial\nto ascertain analytically the probability of emergence of the less biased\nconsensus when individuals are connected through a social network and have\ndifferent priors, I use simulations to analyze its determinants. Three main\nresults derived from this exercise are that, in expected terms, i) some network\ntopologies are more conducive to consensus efficiency, ii) some degree of\npartisanship enhances consensus efficiency even under confirmation bias and\niii) open-mindedness, i.e. when partisans agree to exchange opinions with other\npartisans with polar opposite beliefs, might harm efficiency in some cases.",

    "title": "A Learning and Control Perspective for Microfinance",
    "abstract": "Microfinance in developing areas such as Africa has been proven to improve\nthe local economy significantly. However, many applicants in developing areas\ncannot provide adequate information required by the financial institution to\nmake a lending decision. As a result, it is challenging for microfinance\ninstitutions to assign credit properly based on conventional policies. In this\npaper, we formulate the decision-making of microfinance into a rigorous\noptimization-based framework involving learning and control. We propose an\nalgorithm to explore and learn the optimal policy to approve or reject\napplicants. We provide the conditions under which the algorithms are guaranteed\nto converge to an optimal one. The proposed algorithm can naturally deal with\nmissing information and systematically tradeoff multiple objectives such as\nprofit maximization, financial inclusion, social benefits, and economic\ndevelopment. Through extensive simulation of both real and synthetic\nmicrofinance datasets, we showed our proposed algorithm is superior to existing\nbenchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to make a\nconnection between microfinance and control and use control-theoretic tools to\noptimize the policy with a provable guarantee.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of variance estimation in general graph-structured\nproblems. First, we develop a linear time estimator for the homoscedastic case\nthat can consistently estimate the variance in general graphs. We show that our\nestimator attains minimax rates for the chain and 2D grid graphs when the mean\nsignal has a total variation with canonical scaling. Furthermore, we provide\ngeneral upper bounds on the mean squared error performance of the fused lasso\nestimator in general graphs under a moment condition and a bound on the tail\nbehavior of the errors. These upper bounds allow us to generalize for broader\nclasses of distributions, such as sub-Exponential, many existing results on the\nfused lasso that are only known to hold with the assumption that errors are\nsub-Gaussian random variables. Exploiting our upper bounds, we then study a\nsimple total variation regularization estimator for estimating the signal of\nvariances in the heteroscedastic case. Our results show that the variance\nestimator attains minimax rates for estimating signals of bounded variation in\ngrid graphs, $K$-nearest neighbor graphs with very mild assumptions, and it is\nconsistent for estimating the variances in any connected graph. In addition,\nextensive numerical results show that our proposed estimators perform\nreasonably well in a variety of graph-structured models.",

    "abstract": "The incidence rate for skin cancer has been steadily increasing throughout\nthe world, leading to it being a serious issue. Diagnosis at an early stage has\nthe potential to drastically reduce the harm caused by the disease, however,\nthe traditional biopsy is a labor-intensive and invasive procedure. In\naddition, numerous rural communities do not have easy access to hospitals and\ndo not prefer visiting one for what they feel might be a minor issue. Using\nmachine learning and deep learning for skin cancer classification can increase\naccessibility and reduce the discomforting procedures involved in the\ntraditional lesion detection process. These models can be wrapped in web or\nmobile apps and serve a greater population. In this paper, two such models are\ntested on the benchmark HAM10000 dataset of common skin lesions. They are\nRandom Forest with Stratified K-Fold Validation, and MobileNetV2 (throughout\nthe rest of the paper referred to as MobileNet). The MobileNet model was\ntrained separately using both TensorFlow and PyTorch frameworks. A side-by-side\ncomparison of both deep learning and machine learning models and a comparison\nof the same deep learning model on different frameworks for skin lesion\ndiagnosis in a resource-constrained mobile environment has not been conducted\nbefore. The results indicate that each of these models fares better at\ndifferent classification tasks. For greater overall recall, accuracy, and\ndetection of malignant melanoma, the TensorFlow MobileNet was the better\nchoice. However, for detecting noncancerous skin lesions, the PyTorch MobileNet\nproved to be better. Random Forest was the better algorithm when it came to\nhaving a low computational cost with moderate correctness.",

So Deep\nConvolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is introduced in the medical field for\nmaking accurate diagnoses and aiding in the patient's treatment before surgery.\nBut these networks have problems such as overfitting and being unable to\nextract necessary features for classification. To overcome these problems, we\ndeveloped the TDA-IPH and Convolutional Transfer learning and Visual Recurrent\nlearning with Elephant Herding Optimization hyper-parameter tuning (CTVR-EHO)\nmodels for BT segmentation and classification. Initially, the Topological Data\nAnalysis based Improved Persistent Homology (TDA-IPH) is designed to segment\nthe BT image.

Elephant Herding Optimization (EHO) is used to\ntune the hyper parameters of both networks to get an optimal result. Finally,\nextracted features are concatenated and classified using the softmax activation\nlayer. The simulation result of this proposed CTVR-EHO and TDA-IPH method is\nanalysed based on some metrics such as precision, accuracy, recall, loss, and F\nscore.

In this paper, a\njoint proportional fairness scheduling (JPFS) optimization problem for\nestablishing optimum mmWave concurrent transmission links is formulated. And,\nto find a solution to this non-polynomial (NP) time problem, we use exhaustive\nsearch (ES) scheme. Numerical simulation proves the effectiveness of using the\nES scheme to improve the system performance.",
