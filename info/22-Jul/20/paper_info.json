    "title": "Unified 2D and 3D Pre-Training of Molecular Representations",
    "abstract": "Molecular representation learning has attracted much attention recently. A\nmolecule can be viewed as a 2D graph with nodes/atoms connected by edges/bonds,\nand can also be represented by a 3D conformation with 3-dimensional coordinates\nof all atoms. We note that most previous work handles 2D and 3D information\nseparately, while jointly leveraging these two sources may foster a more\ninformative representation. In this work, we explore this appealing idea and\npropose a new representation learning method based on a unified 2D and 3D\npre-training. Atom coordinates and interatomic distances are encoded and then\nfused with atomic representations through graph neural networks. The model is\npre-trained on three tasks: reconstruction of masked atoms and coordinates, 3D\nconformation generation conditioned on 2D graph, and 2D graph generation\nconditioned on 3D conformation. We evaluate our method on 11 downstream\nmolecular property prediction tasks: 7 with 2D information only and 4 with both\n2D and 3D information. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on 10\ntasks, and the average improvement on 2D-only tasks is 8.3%. Our method also\nachieves significant improvement on two 3D conformation generation tasks.",

    "title": "Global-Local Stepwise Generative Network for Ultra High-Resolution Image  Restoration",
    "abstract": "While the research on image background restoration from regular size of\ndegraded images has achieved remarkable progress, restoring ultra\nhigh-resolution (e.g., 4K) images remains an extremely challenging task due to\nthe explosion of computational complexity and memory usage, as well as the\ndeficiency of annotated data. In this paper we present a novel model for ultra\nhigh-resolution image restoration, referred to as the Global-Local Stepwise\nGenerative Network (GLSGN), which employs a stepwise restoring strategy\ninvolving four restoring pathways: three local pathways and one global pathway.\nThe local pathways focus on conducting image restoration in a fine-grained\nmanner over local but high-resolution image patches, while the global pathway\nperforms image restoration coarsely on the scale-down but intact image to\nprovide cues for the local pathways in a global view including semantics and\nnoise patterns. To smooth the mutual collaboration between these four pathways,\nour GLSGN is designed to ensure the inter-pathway consistency in four aspects\nin terms of low-level content, perceptual attention, restoring intensity and\nhigh-level semantics, respectively. As another major contribution of this work,\nwe also introduce the first ultra high-resolution dataset to date for both\nreflection removal and rain streak removal, comprising 4,670 real-world and\nsynthetic images. Extensive experiments across three typical tasks for image\nbackground restoration, including image reflection removal, image rain streak\nremoval and image dehazing, show that our GLSGN consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "In supervised learning, the presence of noise can have a significant impact\non decision making. Since many classifiers do not take label noise into account\nin the derivation of the loss function, including the loss functions of\nlogistic regression, SVM, and AdaBoost, especially the AdaBoost iterative\nalgorithm, whose core idea is to continuously increase the weight value of the\nmisclassified samples, the weight of samples in many presence of label noise\nwill be increased, leading to a decrease in model accuracy. In addition, the\nlearning process of BP neural network and decision tree will also be affected\nby label noise. Therefore, solving the label noise problem is an important\nelement of maintaining the robustness of the network model, which is of great\npractical significance. Granular ball computing is an important modeling method\ndeveloped in the field of granular computing in recent years, which is an\nefficient, robust and scalable learning method. In this paper, we pioneered a\ngranular ball neural network algorithm model, which adopts the idea of\nmulti-granular to filter label noise samples during model training, solving the\ncurrent problem of model instability caused by label noise in the field of deep\nlearning, greatly reducing the proportion of label noise in training samples\nand improving the robustness of neural network models.",

This paper proposes a novel geometric framework for multimodal\nstress/pain detection utilizing Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices as a\nrepresentation that incorporates the correlation relationship of physiological\nand behavioural signals from covariance and cross-covariance. Considering the\nnon-linearity of the Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices, well-known machine\nlearning techniques are not suited to classify these matrices. Therefore, a\ntangent space mapping method is adopted to map the derived SPD matrix sequences\nto the vector sequences in the tangent space where the LSTM-based network can\nbe applied for classification.

    "abstract": "Designing smart home services is a complex task when multiple services with a\nlarge number of sensors and actuators are deployed simultaneously. It may rely\non knowledge-based or data-driven approaches. The former can use rule-based\nmethods to design services statically, and the latter can use learning methods\nto discover inhabitants' preferences dynamically. However, neither of these\napproaches is entirely satisfactory because rules cannot cover all possible\nsituations that may change, and learning methods may make decisions that are\nsometimes incomprehensible to the inhabitant. In this paper, PBRE (Pedagogic\nBased Rule Extractor) is proposed to extract rules from learning methods to\nrealize dynamic rule generation for smart home systems. The expected advantage\nis that both the explainability of rule-based methods and the dynamicity of\nlearning methods are adopted. We compare PBRE with an existing rule extraction\nmethod, and the results show better performance of PBRE. We also apply PBRE to\nextract rules from a smart home service represented by an NRL (Neural\nNetwork-based Reinforcement Learning).

    "abstract": "Since proposed in [X. Zhang and C.-W. Shu, J. Comput. Phys., 229: 3091--3120,\n2010], the Zhang--Shu framework has attracted extensive attention and motivated\nmany bound-preserving (BP) high-order discontinuous Galerkin and finite volume\nschemes for various hyperbolic equations. A key ingredient in the framework is\nthe decomposition of the cell averages of the numerical solution into a convex\ncombination of the solution values at certain quadrature points, which helps to\nrewrite high-order schemes as convex combinations of formally first-order\nschemes. The classic convex decomposition originally proposed by Zhang and Shu\nhas been widely used over the past decade. It was verified, only for the 1D\nquadratic and cubic polynomial spaces, that the classic decomposition is\noptimal in the sense of achieving the mildest BP CFL condition. Yet, it\nremained unclear whether the classic decomposition is optimal in multiple\ndimensions. In this paper, we find that the classic multidimensional\ndecomposition based on the tensor product of Gauss--Lobatto and Gauss\nquadratures is generally not optimal, and we discover a novel alternative\ndecomposition for the 2D and 3D polynomial spaces of total degree up to 2 and\n3, respectively, on Cartesian meshes. Our new decomposition allows a larger BP\ntime step-size than the classic one, and moreover, it is rigorously proved to\nbe optimal to attain the mildest BP CFL condition, yet requires much fewer\nnodes. The discovery of such an optimal convex decomposition is highly\nnontrivial yet meaningful, as it may lead to an improvement of high-order BP\nschemes for a large class of hyperbolic or convection-dominated equations, at\nthe cost of only a slight and local modification to the implementation code.\nSeveral numerical examples are provided to further validate the advantages of\nusing our optimal decomposition over the classic one in terms of efficiency.",

    "abstract": "CyberPhysical systems (CPS) must be closely monitored to identify and\npotentially mitigate emergent problems that arise during their routine\noperations. However, the multivariate time-series data which they typically\nproduce can be complex to understand and analyze. While formal product\ndocumentation often provides example data plots with diagnostic suggestions,\nthe sheer diversity of attributes, critical thresholds, and data interactions\ncan be overwhelming to non-experts who subsequently seek help from discussion\nforums to interpret their data logs. Deep learning models, such as Long\nShort-term memory (LSTM) networks can be used to automate these tasks and to\nprovide clear explanations of diverse anomalies detected in real-time\nmultivariate data-streams. In this paper we present RESAM, a requirements\nprocess that integrates knowledge from domain experts, discussion forums, and\nformal product documentation, to discover and specify requirements and design\ndefinitions in the form of time-series attributes that contribute to the\nconstruction of effective deep learning anomaly detectors. We present a\ncase-study based on a flight control system for small Uncrewed Aerial Systems\nand demonstrate that its use guides the construction of effective anomaly\ndetection models whilst also providing underlying support for explainability.\nRESAM is relevant to domains in which open or closed online forums provide\ndiscussion support for log analysis.",

    "abstract": "Fast adversarial training (FAT) effectively improves the efficiency of\nstandard adversarial training (SAT). However, initial FAT encounters\ncatastrophic overfitting, i.e.,the robust accuracy against adversarial attacks\nsuddenly and dramatically decreases. Though several FAT variants spare no\neffort to prevent overfitting, they sacrifice much calculation cost. In this\npaper, we explore the difference between the training processes of SAT and FAT\nand observe that the attack success rate of adversarial examples (AEs) of FAT\ngets worse gradually in the late training stage, resulting in overfitting. The\nAEs are generated by the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) with a zero or random\ninitialization. Based on the observation, we propose a prior-guided FGSM\ninitialization method to avoid overfitting after investigating several\ninitialization strategies, improving the quality of the AEs during the whole\ntraining process. The initialization is formed by leveraging historically\ngenerated AEs without additional calculation cost. We further provide a\ntheoretical analysis for the proposed initialization method. We also propose a\nsimple yet effective regularizer based on the prior-guided initialization,i.e.,\nthe currently generated perturbation should not deviate too much from the\nprior-guided initialization. The regularizer adopts both historical and current\nadversarial perturbations to guide the model learning. Evaluations on four\ndatasets demonstrate that the proposed method can prevent catastrophic\noverfitting and outperform state-of-the-art FAT methods.

    "abstract": "The waive of labels in the target domain makes Unsupervised Domain Adaptation\n(UDA) an attractive technique in many real-world applications, though it also\nbrings great challenges as model adaptation becomes harder without labeled\ntarget data. In this paper, we address this issue by seeking compensation from\ntarget domain prior knowledge, which is often (partially) available in\npractice, e.g., from human expertise. This leads to a novel yet practical\nsetting where in addition to the training data, some prior knowledge about the\ntarget class distribution are available. We term the setting as\nKnowledge-guided Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (KUDA). In particular, we\nconsider two specific types of prior knowledge about the class distribution in\nthe target domain: Unary Bound that describes the lower and upper bounds of\nindividual class probabilities, and Binary Relationship that describes the\nrelations between two class probabilities. We propose a general rectification\nmodule that uses such prior knowledge to refine model generated pseudo labels.\nThe module is formulated as a Zero-One Programming problem derived from the\nprior knowledge and a smooth regularizer. It can be easily plugged into\nself-training based UDA methods, and we combine it with two state-of-the-art\nmethods, SHOT and DINE. Empirical results on four benchmarks confirm that the\nrectification module clearly improves the quality of pseudo labels, which in\nturn benefits the self-training stage. With the guidance from prior knowledge,\nthe performances of both methods are substantially boosted. We expect our work\nto inspire further investigations in integrating prior knowledge in UDA.

    "abstract": "Computer vision-based damage detection using remote cameras and unmanned\naerial vehicles (UAVs) enables efficient and low-cost bridge health monitoring\nthat reduces labor costs and the needs for sensor installation and maintenance.\nBy leveraging recent semantic image segmentation approaches, we are able to\nfind regions of critical structural components and recognize damage at the\npixel level using images as the only input. However, existing methods perform\npoorly when detecting small damages (e.g., cracks and exposed rebars) and thin\nobjects with limited image samples, especially when the components of interest\nare highly imbalanced. To this end, this paper introduces a semantic\nsegmentation framework that imposes the hierarchical semantic relationship\nbetween component category and damage types. For example, certain concrete\ncracks only present on bridge columns and therefore the non-column region will\nbe masked out when detecting such damages. In this way, the damage detection\nmodel could focus on learning features from possible damaged regions only and\navoid the effects of other irrelevant regions. We also utilize multi-scale\naugmentation that provides views with different scales that preserves\ncontextual information of each image without losing the ability of handling\nsmall and thin objects. Furthermore, the proposed framework employs important\nsampling that repeatedly samples images containing rare components (e.g.,\nrailway sleeper and exposed rebars) to provide more data samples, which\naddresses the imbalanced data challenge.",

    "abstract": "This article presents and describes a 229 bus test system that includes wind,\nhydro and fossil fuel power plants. It represents the Northeast subsystem of\nthe Brazilian Interconnected Power System (BIPS). The test system supplies a\nload of 4.17 GW, being 13% powered by wind farms, which is the current wind\npower penetration level of the BIPS. The data comprehends different load levels\nbased on the typical load behavior and typical capacity factors of wind, hydro\nand fossil fuel plants, as well as the capacity of transmission and\nsub-transmission lines, transformers, and the adopted structure for the test\nsystem. The data is compiled considering models and operating scenarios of the\nBIPS, and allow performing studies of static voltage stability, sensitivity of\nvoltage stability margin considering the wind farms, and multi-objective\noptimization considering market constraints. The results of the simulations\nwith the test system indicate the consistency of their data structure and its\napplicability to different studies of electric power systems.",

    "abstract": "This letter proposes traffic management for multiple automated mobile robots\n(AMRs) based on a layered cost map. Multiple AMRs communicate via a data\ndistribution service (DDS), which is shared by topics in the same DDS domain.\nThe cost of each layer is manipulated by topics. The traffic management server\nin the domain sends or receives topics to each of AMRs. Using the layered cost\nmap, the new concept of prohibition filter, lane filter, fleet layer, and\nregion filter are proposed and implemented. The prohibition filter can help a\nuser set an area that would prohibit an AMR from trespassing. The lane filter\ncan help set one-way directions based on an angle image. The fleet layer can\nhelp AMRs share their locations via the traffic management server. The region\nfilter requests for or receives an exclusive area, which can be occupied by\nonly one AMR, from the traffic management server. All the layers are\nexperimentally validated with real-world AMRs. Each area can be configured with\nuser-defined images or text-based parameter files.",

    "abstract": "Since the seminal result of Karger, Motwani, and Sudan, algorithms for\napproximate 3-coloring have primarily centered around SDP-based rounding.\nHowever, it is likely that important combinatorial or algebraic insights are\nneeded in order to break the $n^{o(1)}$ threshold. One way to develop new\nunderstanding in graph coloring is to study special subclasses of graphs. For\ninstance, Blum studied the 3-coloring of random graphs, and Arora and Ge\nstudied the 3-coloring of graphs with low threshold-rank.\nIn this work, we study graphs which arise from a tensor product, which appear\nto be novel instances of the 3-coloring problem. We consider graphs of the form\n$H = (V,E)$ with $V =V( K_3 \\times G)$ and $E = E(K_3 \\times G) \\setminus E'$,\nwhere $E' \\subseteq E(K_3 \\times G)$ is any edge set such that no vertex has\nmore than an $\\epsilon$ fraction of its edges in $E'$. We show that one can\nconstruct $\\widetilde{H} = K_3 \\times \\widetilde{G}$ with $V(\\widetilde{H}) =\nV(H)$ that is close to $H$. For arbitrary $G$, $\\widetilde{H}$ satisfies $|E(H)\n\\Delta E(\\widetilde{H})| \\leq O(\\epsilon|E(H)|)$. Additionally when $G$ is a\nmild expander, we provide a 3-coloring for $H$ in polynomial time. These\nresults partially generalize an exact tensor factorization algorithm of Imrich.\nOn the other hand, without any assumptions on $G$, we show that it is NP-hard\nto 3-color $H$.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we are interested in Detection Transformer (DETR), an\nend-to-end object detection approach based on a transformer encoder-decoder\narchitecture without hand-crafted postprocessing, such as NMS. Inspired by\nConditional DETR, an improved DETR with fast training convergence, that\npresented box queries (originally called spatial queries) for internal decoder\nlayers, we reformulate the object query into the format of the box query that\nis a composition of the embeddings of the reference point and the\ntransformation of the box with respect to the reference point. This\nreformulation indicates the connection between the object query in DETR and the\nanchor box that is widely studied in Faster R-CNN. Furthermore, we learn the\nbox queries from the image content, further improving the detection quality of\nConditional DETR still with fast training convergence. In addition, we adopt\nthe idea of axial self-attention to save the memory cost and accelerate the\nencoder. The resulting detector, called Conditional DETR V2, achieves better\nresults than Conditional DETR, saves the memory cost and runs more efficiently.\nFor example, for the DC$5$-ResNet-$50$ backbone, our approach achieves $44.8$\nAP with $16.4$ FPS on the COCO $val$ set and compared to Conditional DETR, it\nruns $1.6\\times$ faster, saves $74$\\% of the overall memory cost, and improves\n$1.0$ AP score.",

Measuring hand use in the home environment is necessary to evaluate the\nimpact of new interventions, and calls for novel wearable technologies.\nEgocentric video can capture hand-object interactions in context, as well as\nshow how more-affected hands are used during bilateral tasks (for stabilization\nor manipulation). Automated methods are required to extract this information.\nObjective: To use artificial intelligence-based computer vision to classify\nhand use and hand role from egocentric videos recorded at home after stroke.\nMethods: Twenty-one stroke survivors participated in the study. A random forest\nclassifier, a SlowFast neural network, and the Hand Object Detector neural\nnetwork were applied to identify hand use and hand role at home.\nLeave-One-Subject-Out-Cross-Validation (LOSOCV) was used to evaluate the\nperformance of the three models. Between-group differences of the models were\ncalculated based on the Mathews correlation coefficient (MCC). Results: For\nhand use detection, the Hand Object Detector had significantly higher\nperformance than the other models. The macro average MCCs using this model in\nthe LOSOCV were 0.50 +- 0.23 for the more-affected hands and 0.58 +- 0.18 for\nthe less-affected hands. Hand role classification had macro average MCCs in the\nLOSOCV that were close to zero for all models. Conclusion: Using egocentric\nvideo to capture the hand use of stroke survivors at home is feasible. Pose\nestimation to track finger movements may be beneficial to classifying hand\nroles in the future.",

We propose to align the metadata annotations to PRIMAD, which\nconsiders components of computational experiments that can affect\nreproducibility. Furthermore, we outline important components and information\nthat should be reported in the metadata and give evidence from the literature.\nTo demonstrate the usefulness of these metadata annotations, we implement new\nfeatures in repro_eval that support the outlined metadata schema for the use\ncase of reproducibility studies.

Formally, it is the task of\nselecting $k$ seed nodes in a social network such that the expected number of\ninfluenced nodes in the network (under some influence propagation model) is\nmaximized. This problem has been widely studied in the literature and several\nsolution approaches have been proposed.

Sparsity-promoting\nregularization is a key ingredient in solving modern signal reconstruction\nproblems; however, the operators underlying these regularizers are usually\neither designed by hand or learned from data in an unsupervised way. The recent\nsuccess of supervised learning (mainly convolutional neural networks) in\nsolving image reconstruction problems suggests that it could be a fruitful\napproach to designing regularizers. Towards this end, we propose to denoise\nsignals using a variational formulation with a parametric, sparsity-promoting\nregularizer, where the parameters of the regularizer are learned to minimize\nthe mean squared error of reconstructions on a training set of ground truth\nimage and measurement pairs. Training involves solving a challenging bilievel\noptimization problem; we derive an expression for the gradient of the training\nloss using the closed-form solution of the denoising problem and provide an\naccompanying gradient descent algorithm to minimize it. Our experiments with\nstructured 1D signals and natural images show that the proposed method can\nlearn an operator that outperforms well-known regularizers (total variation,\nDCT-sparsity, and unsupervised dictionary learning) and collaborative filtering\nfor denoising. While the approach we present is specific to denoising, we\nbelieve that it could be adapted to the larger class of inverse problems with\nlinear measurement models, giving it applicability in a wide range of signal\nreconstruction settings.",

    "title": "MonoIndoor++:Towards Better Practice of Self-Supervised Monocular Depth  Estimation for Indoor Environments",
    "abstract": "Self-supervised monocular depth estimation has seen significant progress in\nrecent years, especially in outdoor environments. However, depth prediction\nresults are not satisfying in indoor scenes where most of the existing data are\ncaptured with hand-held devices. As compared to outdoor environments,\nestimating depth of monocular videos for indoor environments, using\nself-supervised methods, results in two additional challenges: (i) the depth\nrange of indoor video sequences varies a lot across different frames, making it\ndifficult for the depth network to induce consistent depth cues for training;\n(ii) the indoor sequences recorded with handheld devices often contain much\nmore rotational motions, which cause difficulties for the pose network to\npredict accurate relative camera poses. In this work, we propose a novel\nframework-MonoIndoor++ by giving special considerations to those challenges and\nconsolidating a set of good practices for improving the performance of\nself-supervised monocular depth estimation for indoor environments. First, a\ndepth factorization module with transformer-based scale regression network is\nproposed to estimate a global depth scale factor explicitly, and the predicted\nscale factor can indicate the maximum depth values. Second, rather than using a\nsingle-stage pose estimation strategy as in previous methods, we propose to\nutilize a residual pose estimation module to estimate relative camera poses\nacross consecutive frames iteratively. Third, to incorporate extensive\ncoordinates guidance for our residual pose estimation module, we propose to\nperform coordinate convolutional encoding directly over the inputs to pose\nnetworks.

Instead of a standard exploration-exploitation dilemma, the\nlearner has to face another challenge in this setting: due to limited\nobservations outside of their control, the learner may not be able to estimate\nthe value of each policy equally well. To address this issue, we propose a set\nof algorithms that guarantee regret bounds that scale with a natural notion of\nmismatch between any comparator policy and the behavior policy, achieving\nimproved performance against comparators that are well-covered by the\nobservations.

We theoretically and empirically analyze how ballot length can\ninfluence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show\nthat there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$\ndifferent candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower\nbounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide\nconstructions matching these bounds. Additionally, we fully characterize which\nsequences of winners are possible over ballot lengths and provide explicit\nprofile constructions achieving any feasible winner sequence.

    "abstract": "The target of space-time video super-resolution (STVSR) is to increase both\nthe frame rate (also referred to as the temporal resolution) and the spatial\nresolution of a given video. Recent approaches solve STVSR with end-to-end deep\nneural networks. A popular solution is to first increase the frame rate of the\nvideo; then perform feature refinement among different frame features; and last\nincrease the spatial resolutions of these features. The temporal correlation\namong features of different frames is carefully exploited in this process. The\nspatial correlation among features of different (spatial) resolutions, despite\nbeing also very important, is however not emphasized. In this paper, we propose\na spatial-temporal feature interaction network to enhance STVSR by exploiting\nboth spatial and temporal correlations among features of different frames and\nspatial resolutions. Specifically, the spatial-temporal frame interpolation\nmodule is introduced to interpolate low- and high-resolution intermediate frame\nfeatures simultaneously and interactively. The spatial-temporal local and\nglobal refinement modules are respectively deployed afterwards to exploit the\nspatial-temporal correlation among different features for their refinement.\nFinally, a novel motion consistency loss is employed to enhance the motion\ncontinuity among reconstructed frames. We conduct experiments on three standard\nbenchmarks, Vid4, Vimeo-90K and Adobe240, and the results demonstrate that our\nmethod improves the state of the art methods by a considerable margin.

We specifically address the problem of\nfinding strategies for managing measurement communication costs between agents.\nA well understood technique for trading off communication costs with estimation\naccuracy is event triggering (ET), where measurements are only communicated\nwhen useful, e.g., when Kalman filter innovations exceed some threshold. In the\nabsence of measurements, agents can use implicit information to achieve results\nalmost as well as when explicit data is always communicated. However, there are\nno methods for setting this threshold with formal guarantees on task\nperformance. We fill this gap by developing a novel belief space discretization\ntechnique to abstract a continuous space dynamics model for ET estimation to a\ndiscrete Markov decision process, which scalably accommodates\nthreshold-sensitive ET estimator error covariances. We then apply an existing\nprobabilistic trade-off analysis tool to find the set of all optimal trade-offs\nbetween resource consumption and task performance. From this set, an ET\nthreshold selection strategy is extracted. Simulated results show our approach\nidentifies non-trivial trade-offs between performance and energy savings, with\nonly modest computational effort.",

In dominant approaches to iris recognition, the\nsize of a ring-shaped iris region is linearly scaled to a canonical rectangle,\nused further in encoding and matching. However, the biological complexity of\niris sphincter and dilator muscles causes the movements of iris features to be\nnonlinear in a function of pupil size, and not solely organized along radial\npaths. Alternatively to the existing theoretical models based on biomechanics\nof iris musculature, in this paper we propose a novel deep autoencoder-based\nmodel that can effectively learn complex movements of iris texture features\ndirectly from the data. The proposed model takes two inputs, (a) an\nISO-compliant near-infrared iris image with initial pupil size, and (b) the\nbinary mask defining the target shape of the iris. The model makes all the\nnecessary nonlinear deformations to the iris texture to match the shape of iris\nin image (a) with the shape provided by the target mask (b). The\nidentity-preservation component of the loss function helps the model in finding\ndeformations that preserve identity and not only visual realism of generated\nsamples. We also demonstrate two immediate applications of this model: better\ncompensation for iris texture deformations in iris recognition algorithms,\ncompared to linear models, and creation of generative algorithm that can aid\nhuman forensic examiners, who may need to compare iris images with large\ndifference in pupil dilation.

However, the\nrendering process is complicated and takes a significant amount of time, not\nonly in the rendering itself but in the setting of the scene as well.\nMaterials, lights and cameras need to be set in order to get the best quality\nresults. Nevertheless, the optimal output may not be obtained in the first\nrender. This all makes the rendering process a tedious process. Since\nGoodfellow et al. introduced Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in 2014\n[1], they have been used to generate computer-assigned synthetic data, from\nnon-existing human faces to medical data analysis or image style transfer. GANs\nhave been used to transfer image textures from one domain to another. However,\npaired data from both domains was needed.

The former policy is derived by casting the main\nproblem into a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) problem, which is\nthen solved using the Lagrangian relaxation, relative value iteration\nalgorithm, and bisection. The LC-DT policy is developed via the\ndrift-plus-penalty (DPP) method by transforming the main problem into a\nsequence of per-slot problems. Finally, we consider unknown environment and\ndevise a learning-based transmission policy by relaxing the CMDP problem into\nan MDP problem using the DPP method and then adopting the deep Q-learning\nalgorithm. Numerical results show that the proposed policies achieve\nnear-optimal performance and illustrate the benefits of HARQ in status\nupdating.",

We\nintroduce Structure from Action (SfA), a framework that discovers the 3D part\ngeometry and joint parameters of unseen articulated objects via a sequence of\ninferred interactions. Our key insight is that 3D interaction and perception\nshould be considered in conjunction to construct 3D articulated CAD models,\nespecially in the case of categories not seen during training. By selecting\ninformative interactions, SfA discovers parts and reveals initially occluded\nsurfaces, like the inside of a closed drawer. By aggregating visual\nobservations in 3D, SfA accurately segments multiple parts, reconstructs part\ngeometry, and infers all joint parameters in a canonical coordinate frame. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that a single SfA model trained in simulation can\ngeneralize to many unseen object categories with unknown kinematic structures\nand to real-world objects.

    "abstract": "Fault localization is challenging in an online service system due to its\nmonitoring data's large volume and variety and complex dependencies across or\nwithin its components (e.g., services or databases). Furthermore, engineers\nrequire fault localization solutions to be actionable and interpretable, which\nexisting research approaches cannot satisfy. Therefore, the common industry\npractice is that, for a specific online service system, its experienced\nengineers focus on localization for recurring failures based on the knowledge\naccumulated about the system and historical failures. Although the above common\npractice is actionable and interpretable, it is largely manual, thus slow and\nsometimes inaccurate. In this paper, we aim to automate this practice through\nmachine learning. That is, we propose an actionable and interpretable fault\nlocalization approach, DejaVu, for recurring failures in online service\nsystems. For a specific online service system, DejaVu takes historical failures\nand dependencies in the system as input and trains a localization model\noffline; for an incoming failure, the trained model online recommends where the\nfailure occurs (i.e., the faulty components) and which kind of failure occurs\n(i.e., the indicative group of metrics) (thus actionable), which are further\ninterpreted by both global and local interpretation methods (thus\ninterpretable). Based on the evaluation on 601 failures from three production\nsystems and one open-source benchmark, in less than one second, DejaVu can on\naverage rank the ground truths at 1.66-th to 5.03-th among a long candidate\nlist, outperforming baselines by at least 51.51%.",

Hence, it is critical to design a security patch\nidentification system to ensure the security of the utilized software. However,\nmost of the existing works for security patch identification just consider the\nchanged code and the commit message of a commit as a flat sequence of tokens\nwith simple neural networks to learn its semantics, while the structure\ninformation is ignored. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose\nour well-designed approach E-SPI, which extracts the structure information\nhidden in a commit for effective identification. Specifically, it consists of\nthe code change encoder to extract the syntactic of the changed code with the\nBiLSTM to learn the code representation and the message encoder to construct\nthe dependency graph for the commit message with the graph neural network (GNN)\nto learn the message representation. We further enhance the code change encoder\nby embedding contextual information related to the changed code. To demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our approach, we conduct the extensive experiments against\nsix state-of-the-art approaches on the existing dataset and from the real\ndeployment environment.

As a recent example, while deep learning has shown\nimpressive performance in electrocardiogram (ECG) classification, Han et al.\ncrafted realistic perturbations that fooled the network 74% of the time [2020].\nCurrent adversarial defense paradigms are computationally intensive and\nimpractical for many high dimensional problems.

    "title": "HICF: Hyperbolic Informative Collaborative Filtering",
    "abstract": "Considering the prevalence of the power-law distribution in user-item\nnetworks, hyperbolic space has attracted considerable attention and achieved\nimpressive performance in the recommender system recently. The advantage of\nhyperbolic recommendation lies in that its exponentially increasing capacity is\nwell-suited to describe the power-law distributed user-item network whereas the\nEuclidean equivalent is deficient. Nonetheless, it remains unclear which kinds\nof items can be effectively recommended by the hyperbolic model and which\ncannot. To address the above concerns, we take the most basic recommendation\ntechnique, collaborative filtering, as a medium, to investigate the behaviors\nof hyperbolic and Euclidean recommendation models. The results reveal that (1)\ntail items get more emphasis in hyperbolic space than that in Euclidean space,\nbut there is still ample room for improvement; (2) head items receive modest\nattention in hyperbolic space, which could be considerably improved; (3) and\nnonetheless, the hyperbolic models show more competitive performance than\nEuclidean models. Driven by the above observations, we design a novel learning\nmethod, named hyperbolic informative collaborative filtering (HICF), aiming to\ncompensate for the recommendation effectiveness of the head item while at the\nsame time improving the performance of the tail item. The main idea is to adapt\nthe hyperbolic margin ranking learning, making its pull and push procedure\ngeometric-aware, and providing informative guidance for the learning of both\nhead and tail items. Extensive experiments back up the analytic findings and\nalso show the effectiveness of the proposed method. The work is valuable for\npersonalized recommendations since it reveals that the hyperbolic space\nfacilitates modeling the tail item, which often represents user-customized\npreferences or new products.",

    "abstract": "Real-world data typically follow a long-tailed distribution, where a few\nmajority categories occupy most of the data while most minority categories\ncontain a limited number of samples. Classification models minimizing\ncross-entropy struggle to represent and classify the tail classes. Although the\nproblem of learning unbiased classifiers has been well studied, methods for\nrepresenting imbalanced data are under-explored. In this paper, we focus on\nrepresentation learning for imbalanced data. Recently, supervised contrastive\nlearning has shown promising performance on balanced data recently. However,\nthrough our theoretical analysis, we find that for long-tailed data, it fails\nto form a regular simplex which is an ideal geometric configuration for\nrepresentation learning. To correct the optimization behavior of SCL and\nfurther improve the performance of long-tailed visual recognition, we propose a\nnovel loss for balanced contrastive learning (BCL). Compared with SCL, we have\ntwo improvements in BCL: class-averaging, which balances the gradient\ncontribution of negative classes; class-complement, which allows all classes to\nappear in every mini-batch. The proposed balanced contrastive learning (BCL)\nmethod satisfies the condition of forming a regular simplex and assists the\noptimization of cross-entropy. Equipped with BCL, the proposed two-branch\nframework can obtain a stronger feature representation and achieve competitive\nperformance on long-tailed benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-10-LT,\nCIFAR-100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018.

In this\npaper, we propose a novel single-shot box-supervised instance segmentation\napproach, which integrates the classical level set model with deep neural\nnetwork delicately. Specifically, our proposed method iteratively learns a\nseries of level sets through a continuous Chan-Vese energy-based function in an\nend-to-end fashion. A simple mask supervised SOLOv2 model is adapted to predict\nthe instance-aware mask map as the level set for each instance. Both the input\nimage and its deep features are employed as the input data to evolve the level\nset curves, where a box projection function is employed to obtain the initial\nboundary. By minimizing the fully differentiable energy function, the level set\nfor each instance is iteratively optimized within its corresponding bounding\nbox annotation. The experimental results on four challenging benchmarks\ndemonstrate the leading performance of our proposed approach to robust instance\nsegmentation in various scenarios.

    "abstract": "Few-shot open-set recognition aims to classify both seen and novel images\ngiven only limited training data of seen classes. The challenge of this task is\nthat the model is required not only to learn a discriminative classifier to\nclassify the pre-defined classes with few training data but also to reject\ninputs from unseen classes that never appear at training time. In this paper,\nwe propose to solve the problem from two novel aspects. First, instead of\nlearning the decision boundaries between seen classes, as is done in standard\nclose-set classification, we reserve space for unseen classes, such that images\nlocated in these areas are recognized as the unseen classes. Second, to\neffectively learn such decision boundaries, we propose to utilize the\nbackground features from seen classes. As these background regions do not\nsignificantly contribute to the decision of close-set classification, it is\nnatural to use them as the pseudo unseen classes for classifier learning. Our\nextensive experiments show that our proposed method not only outperforms\nmultiple baselines but also sets new state-of-the-art results on three popular\nbenchmarks, namely tieredImageNet, miniImageNet, and Caltech-USCD\nBirds-200-2011 (CUB).",

It builds an\ninterpretable and robust model by selecting the features that contribute the\nmost to the prediction target. However, most mature feature selection\nalgorithms, including supervised and semi-supervised, fail to fully exploit the\ncomplex potential structure between features. We believe that these structures\nare very important for the feature selection process, especially when labels\nare lacking and data is noisy.\nTo this end, we innovatively introduce a deep learning-based self-supervised\nmechanism into feature selection problems, namely batch-Attention-based\nSelf-supervision Feature Selection(A-SFS). Firstly, a multi-task\nself-supervised autoencoder is designed to uncover the hidden structure among\nfeatures with the support of two pretext tasks. Guided by the integrated\ninformation from the multi-self-supervised learning model, a batch-attention\nmechanism is designed to generate feature weights according to batch-based\nfeature selection patterns to alleviate the impacts introduced by a handful of\nnoisy data. This method is compared to 14 major strong benchmarks, including\nLightGBM and XGBoost. Experimental results show that A-SFS achieves the highest\naccuracy in most datasets. Furthermore, this design significantly reduces the\nreliance on labels, with only 1/10 labeled data needed to achieve the same\nperformance as those state of art baselines.

The training of CNNs is generally\nperformed using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based optimization\ntechniques.

In this paper, we propose a\nmoment centralization-based SGD optimizer for CNNs. Specifically, we impose the\nzero mean constraints on the first-order moment explicitly. The proposed moment\ncentralization is generic in nature and can be integrated with any of the\nexisting adaptive momentum-based optimizers. The proposed idea is tested with\nthree state-of-the-art optimization techniques, including Adam, Radam, and\nAdabelief on benchmark CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet datasets for image\nclassification. The performance of the existing optimizers is generally\nimproved when integrated with the proposed moment centralization. Further, The\nresults of the proposed moment centralization are also better than the existing\ngradient centralization.

To address this\nissue, ITL methods use episodic memory, parameter regularization, masking and\npruning, or extensible network structures. In this paper, we propose a new\nincremental task learning framework based on low-rank factorization. In\nparticular, we represent the network weights for each layer as a linear\ncombination of several rank-1 matrices. To update the network for a new task,\nwe learn a rank-1 (or low-rank) matrix and add that to the weights of every\nlayer.

    "abstract": "Incremental learning is one paradigm to enable model building and updating at\nscale with streaming data. For end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR)\ntasks, the absence of human annotated labels along with the need for privacy\npreserving policies for model building makes it a daunting challenge. Motivated\nby these challenges, in this paper we use a cloud based framework for\nproduction systems to demonstrate insights from privacy preserving incremental\nlearning for automatic speech recognition (ILASR). By privacy preserving, we\nmean, usage of ephemeral data which are not human annotated. This system is a\nstep forward for production levelASR models for incremental/continual learning\nthat offers near real-time test-bed for experimentation in the cloud for\nend-to-end ASR, while adhering to privacy-preserving policies. We show that the\nproposed system can improve the production models significantly(3%) over a new\ntime period of six months even in the absence of human annotated labels with\nvarying levels of weak supervision and large batch sizes in incremental\nlearning. This improvement is 20% over test sets with new words and phrases in\nthe new time period. We demonstrate the effectiveness of model building in a\nprivacy-preserving incremental fashion for ASR while further exploring the\nutility of having an effective teacher model and use of large batch sizes.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL), a distributed machine learning paradigm, has been\nadapted to mitigate privacy concerns for customers. Despite their appeal, there\nare various inference attacks that can exploit shared-plaintext model updates\nto embed traces of customer private information, leading to serious privacy\nconcerns. To alleviate this privacy issue, cryptographic techniques such as\nSecure Multi-Party Computation and Homomorphic Encryption have been used for\nprivacy-preserving FL. However, such security issues in privacy-preserving FL\nare poorly elucidated and underexplored. This work is the first attempt to\nelucidate the triviality of performing model corruption attacks on\nprivacy-preserving FL based on lightweight secret sharing. We consider\nscenarios in which model updates are quantized to reduce communication overhead\nin this case, where an adversary can simply provide local parameters outside\nthe legal range to corrupt the model. We then propose the MUD-PQFed protocol,\nwhich can precisely detect malicious clients performing attacks and enforce\nfair penalties. By removing the contributions of detected malicious clients,\nthe global model utility is preserved to be comparable to the baseline global\nmodel without the attack. Extensive experiments validate effectiveness in\nmaintaining baseline accuracy and detecting malicious clients in a fine-grained\nmanner",

    "abstract": "As a pivotal component to attaining generalizable solutions in human\nintelligence, reasoning provides great potential for reinforcement learning\n(RL) agents' generalization towards varied goals by summarizing part-to-whole\narguments and discovering cause-and-effect relations. However, how to discover\nand represent causalities remains a huge gap that hinders the development of\ncausal RL. In this paper, we augment Goal-Conditioned RL (GCRL) with Causal\nGraph (CG), a structure built upon the relation between objects and events. We\nnovelly formulate the GCRL problem into variational likelihood maximization\nwith CG as latent variables. To optimize the derived objective, we propose a\nframework with theoretical performance guarantees that alternates between two\nsteps: using interventional data to estimate the posterior of CG; using CG to\nlearn generalizable models and interpretable policies. Due to the lack of\npublic benchmarks that verify generalization capability under reasoning, we\ndesign nine tasks and then empirically show the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod against five baselines on these tasks. Further theoretical analysis\nshows that our performance improvement is attributed to the virtuous cycle of\ncausal discovery, transition modeling, and policy training, which aligns with\nthe experimental evidence in extensive ablation studies.",

    "abstract": "This paper is our attempt at answering a twofold question covering the areas\nof ethics and authorship analysis. Firstly, since the methods used for\nperforming authorship analysis imply that an author can be recognized by the\ncontent he or she creates, we were interested in finding out whether it would\nbe possible for an author identification system to correctly attribute works to\nauthors if in the course of years they have undergone a major psychological\ntransition. Secondly, and from the point of view of the evolution of an\nauthor's ethical values, we checked what it would mean if the authorship\nattribution system encounters difficulties in detecting single authorship. We\nset out to answer those questions through performing a binary authorship\nanalysis task using a text classifier based on a pre-trained transformer model\nand a baseline method relying on conventional similarity metrics. For the test\nset, we chose works of Arata Osada, a Japanese educator and specialist in the\nhistory of education, with half of them being books written before the World\nWar II and another half in the 1950s, in between which he underwent a\ntransformation in terms of political opinions. As a result, we were able to\nconfirm that in the case of texts authored by Arata Osada in a time span of\nmore than 10 years, while the classification accuracy drops by a large margin\nand is substantially lower than for texts by other non-fiction writers,\nconfidence scores of the predictions remain at a similar level as in the case\nof a shorter time span, indicating that the classifier was in many instances\ntricked into deciding that texts written over a time span of multiple years\nwere actually written by two different people, which in turn leads us to\nbelieve that such a change can affect authorship analysis, and that historical\nevents have great impact on a person's ethical outlook as expressed in their\nwritings.",

    "abstract": "We consider vertical logistic regression (VLR) trained with mini-batch\ngradient descent -- a setting which has attracted growing interest among\nindustries and proven to be useful in a wide range of applications including\nfinance and medical research. We provide a comprehensive and rigorous privacy\nanalysis of VLR in a class of open-source Federated Learning frameworks, where\nthe protocols might differ between one another, yet a procedure of obtaining\nlocal gradients is implicitly shared. We first consider the honest-but-curious\nthreat model, in which the detailed implementation of protocol is neglected and\nonly the shared procedure is assumed, which we abstract as an oracle. We find\nthat even under this general setting, single-dimension feature and label can\nstill be recovered from the other party under suitable constraints of batch\nsize, thus demonstrating the potential vulnerability of all frameworks\nfollowing the same philosophy. Then we look into a popular instantiation of the\nprotocol based on Homomorphic Encryption (HE). We propose an active attack that\nsignificantly weaken the constraints on batch size in the previous analysis via\ngenerating and compressing auxiliary ciphertext. To address the privacy leakage\nwithin the HE-based protocol, we develop a simple-yet-effective countermeasure\nbased on Differential Privacy (DP), and provide both utility and privacy\nguarantees for the updated algorithm. Finally, we empirically verify the\neffectiveness of our attack and defense on benchmark datasets. Altogether, our\nfindings suggest that all vertical federated learning frameworks that solely\ndepend on HE might contain severe privacy risks, and DP, which has already\ndemonstrated its power in horizontal federated learning, can also play a\ncrucial role in the vertical setting, especially when coupled with HE or secure\nmulti-party computation (MPC) techniques.",

In particular, we consider a challenging scenario\nwhere the target may be a suspicious eavesdropper that potentially intercepts\nthe communication-user information transmitted by the base station (BS). We\ninvestigate the joint design of the phase shifts at the IRS and the\ncommunication as well as radar beamformers at the BS to maximize the sensing\nbeampattern gain towards the target, subject to the maximum information leakage\nto the eavesdropping target and the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise\nratio (SINR) required by users. Based on the availability of perfect channel\nstate information (CSI) of all involved user links and the accurate target\nlocation at the BS, two scenarios are considered and two different optimization\nalgorithms are proposed. For the ideal scenario where the CSI of the user links\nand the target location are perfectly known at the BS, a penalty-based\nalgorithm is proposed to obtain a high-quality solution. In particular, the\nbeamformers are obtained with a semi-closed-form solution using Lagrange\nduality and the IRS phase shifts are solved for in closed form by applying the\nmajorization-minimization (MM) method. On the other hand, for the more\npractical scenario where the CSI is imperfect and the target location is\nuncertain, a robust algorithm based on the $\\cal S$-procedure and\nsign-definiteness approaches is proposed.

    "abstract": "We present improved algorithms and matching statistical and computational\nlower bounds for the problem of identity testing $n$-dimensional distributions.\nIn the identity testing problem, we are given as input an explicit distribution\n$\\mu$, an $\\varepsilon>0$, and access to a sampling oracle for a hidden\ndistribution $\\pi$. The goal is to distinguish whether the two distributions\n$\\mu$ and $\\pi$ are identical or are at least $\\varepsilon$-far apart. When\nthere is only access to full samples from the hidden distribution $\\pi$, it is\nknown that exponentially many samples may be needed, and hence previous works\nhave studied identity testing with additional access to various conditional\nsampling oracles. We consider here a significantly weaker conditional sampling\noracle, called the Coordinate Oracle, and provide a fairly complete\ncomputational and statistical characterization of the identity testing problem\nin this new model.\nWe prove that if an analytic property known as approximate tensorization of\nentropy holds for the visible distribution $\\mu$, then there is an efficient\nidentity testing algorithm for any hidden $\\pi$ that uses\n$\\tilde{O}(n/\\varepsilon)$ queries to the Coordinate Oracle. Approximate\ntensorization of entropy is a classical tool for proving optimal mixing time\nbounds of Markov chains for high-dimensional distributions, and recently has\nbeen established for many families of distributions via spectral independence.\nWe complement our algorithmic result for identity testing with a matching\n$\\Omega(n/\\varepsilon)$ statistical lower bound for the number of queries under\nthe Coordinate Oracle. We also prove a computational phase transition: for\nsparse antiferromagnetic Ising models over $\\{+1,-1\\}^n$, in the regime where\napproximate tensorization of entropy fails, there is no efficient identity\ntesting algorithm unless RP=NP.",

    "abstract": "Semantic simultaneous localization and mapping is a subject of increasing\ninterest in robotics and AI that directly influences the autonomous vehicles\nindustry, the army industries, and more. One of the challenges in this field is\nto obtain object classification jointly with robot trajectory estimation.\nConsidering view-dependent semantic measurements, there is a coupling between\ndifferent classes, resulting in a combinatorial number of hypotheses. A common\nsolution is to prune hypotheses that have a sufficiently low probability and to\nretain only a limited number of hypotheses. However, after pruning and\nrenormalization, the updated probability is overconfident with respect to the\noriginal probability. This is especially problematic for systems that require\nhigh accuracy. If the prior probability of the classes is independent, the\noriginal normalization factor can be computed efficiently without pruning\nhypotheses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to present\nthese results. If the prior probability of the classes is dependent, we propose\na lower bound on the normalization factor that ensures cautious results. The\nbound is calculated incrementally and with similar efficiency as in the\nindependent case. After pruning and updating based on the bound, this belief is\nshown empirically to be close to the original belief.",

Despite\nevent camera's unique data output, many event feature detection and tracking\nalgorithms have shown significant progress by making detours to frame-based\ndata representations. This paper questions the need to do so and proposes a\nnovel event data-friendly method that achieve simultaneous feature detection\nand tracking, called event Clustering-based Detection and Tracking (eCDT). Our\nmethod employs a novel clustering method, named as k-NN Classifier-based\nSpatial Clustering and Applications with Noise (KCSCAN), to cluster adjacent\npolarity events to retrieve event trajectories.With the aid of a Head and Tail\nDescriptor Matching process, event clusters that reappear in a different\npolarity are continually tracked, elongating the feature tracks. Thanks to our\nclustering approach in spatio-temporal space, our method automatically solves\nfeature detection and feature tracking simultaneously. Also, eCDT can extract\nfeature tracks at any frequency with an adjustable time window, which does not\ncorrupt the high temporal resolution of the original event data.

Our key idea is to optimize long-range video correspondence as dense\npoint trajectories and use it to learn robust estimation of motion\nsegmentation. A novel neural network architecture is proposed for processing\nirregular point trajectory data. Camera poses are then estimated and optimized\nwith global bundle adjustment over the portion of long-range point trajectories\nthat are classified as static.

TNW-CATE uses the\nNadaraya-Watson regression for predicting outcomes of patients from the control\nand treatment groups. The main idea behind TNW-CATE is to train kernels of the\nNadaraya-Watson regression by using a weight sharing neural network of a\nspecific form. The network is trained on controls, and it replaces standard\nkernels with a set of neural subnetworks with shared parameters such that every\nsubnetwork implements the trainable kernel, but the whole network implements\nthe Nadaraya-Watson estimator.

    "abstract": "3D scene flow estimation from point clouds is a low-level 3D motion\nperception task in computer vision. Flow embedding is a commonly used technique\nin scene flow estimation, and it encodes the point motion between two\nconsecutive frames. Thus, it is critical for the flow embeddings to capture the\ncorrect overall direction of the motion. However, previous works only search\nlocally to determine a soft correspondence, ignoring the distant points that\nturn out to be the actual matching ones. In addition, the estimated\ncorrespondence is usually from the forward direction of the adjacent point\nclouds, and may not be consistent with the estimated correspondence acquired\nfrom the backward direction. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel\nall-to-all flow embedding layer with backward reliability validation during the\ninitial scene flow estimation. Besides, we investigate and compare several\ndesign choices in key components of the 3D scene flow network, including the\npoint similarity calculation, input elements of predictor, and predictor &\nrefinement level design. After carefully choosing the most effective designs,\nwe are able to present a model that achieves the state-of-the-art performance\non FlyingThings3D and KITTI Scene Flow datasets. Our proposed model surpasses\nall existing methods by at least 38.2% on FlyingThings3D dataset and 24.7% on\nKITTI Scene Flow dataset for EPE3D metric.

    "abstract": "For many tasks, state-of-the-art results have been achieved with\nTransformer-based architectures, resulting in a paradigmatic shift in practices\nfrom the use of task-specific architectures to the fine-tuning of pre-trained\nlanguage models. The ongoing trend consists in training models with an\never-increasing amount of data and parameters, which requires considerable\nresources. It leads to a strong search to improve resource efficiency based on\nalgorithmic and hardware improvements evaluated only for English. This raises\nquestions about their usability when applied to small-scale learning problems,\nfor which a limited amount of training data is available, especially for\nunder-resourced languages tasks. The lack of appropriately sized corpora is a\nhindrance to applying data-driven and transfer learning-based approaches with\nstrong instability cases. In this paper, we establish a state-of-the-art of the\nefforts dedicated to the usability of Transformer-based models and propose to\nevaluate these improvements on the question-answering performances of French\nlanguage which have few resources. We address the instability relating to data\nscarcity by investigating various training strategies with data augmentation,\nhyperparameters optimization and cross-lingual transfer.

Most scalable models apply node-based techniques in\nsimplifying the expensive graph message-passing propagation procedure of GNN.\nHowever, we find such acceleration insufficient when applied to million- or\neven billion-scale graphs. In this work, we propose SCARA, a scalable GNN with\nfeature-oriented optimization for graph computation. SCARA efficiently computes\ngraph embedding from node features, and further selects and reuses feature\ncomputation results to reduce overhead. Theoretical analysis indicates that our\nmodel achieves sub-linear time complexity with a guaranteed precision in\npropagation process as well as GNN training and inference. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on various datasets to evaluate the efficacy and efficiency of\nSCARA. Performance comparison with baselines shows that SCARA can reach up to\n100x graph propagation acceleration than current state-of-the-art methods with\nfast convergence and comparable accuracy. Most notably, it is efficient to\nprocess precomputation on the largest available billion-scale GNN dataset\nPapers100M (111M nodes, 1.6B edges) in 100 seconds.",

    "abstract": "Real-world databases are complex, they usually present redundancy and shared\ncorrelations between heterogeneous and multiple representations of the same\ndata. Thus, exploiting and disentangling shared information between views is\ncritical. For this purpose, recent studies often fuse all views into a shared\nnonlinear complex latent space but they lose the interpretability. To overcome\nthis limitation, here we propose a novel method to combine multiple Variational\nAutoEncoders (VAE) architectures with a Factor Analysis latent space (FA-VAE).\nConcretely, we use a VAE to learn a private representation of each\nheterogeneous view in a continuous latent space. Then, we model the shared\nlatent space by projecting every private variable to a low-dimensional latent\nspace using a linear projection matrix. Thus, we create an interpretable\nhierarchical dependency between private and shared information. This way, the\nnovel model is able to simultaneously: (i) learn from multiple heterogeneous\nviews, (ii) obtain an interpretable hierarchical shared space, and, (iii)\nperform transfer learning between generative models.",

Numerous variants of this theorem have since been established for a\nwide range of logics and system types, including quantitative versions where\nlower bounds on behavioural distance (e.g.~in weighted, metric, or\nprobabilistic transition systems) are witnessed by quantitative modal formulas.\nBoth the qualitative and the quantitative versions have been accommodated\nwithin the framework of coalgebraic logic, with distances taking values in\nquantales, subject to certain restrictions, such as being so-called value\nquantales. While previous quantitative coalgebraic Hennessy-Milner theorems\napply only to liftings of set functors to (pseudo-)metric spaces, in the\npresent work we provide a quantitative coalgebraic Hennessy-Milner theorem that\napplies more widely to functors native to metric spaces; notably, we thus\ncover, for the first time, the well-known Hennessy-Milner theorem for\ncontinuous probabilistic transition systems, where transitions are given by\nBorel measures on metric spaces, as an instance. In the process, we also relax\nthe restrictions imposed on the quantale, and additionally parametrize the\ntechnical account over notions of closure and, hence, density, providing\nassociated variants of the Stone-Weierstrass theorem; this allows us to cover,\nfor instance, behavioural ultrametrics.",

A notable example is the centre of a monoid which always\ndetermines a commutative submonoid. Monads in category theory are important\nalgebraic structures that may be used to model computational effects in\nprogramming languages and in this paper we show how the notion of centre may be\nextended to strong monads acting on symmetric monoidal categories. We show that\nthe centre of a strong monad $\\mathcal T$, if it exists, determines a\ncommutative submonad $\\mathcal Z$ of $\\mathcal T$, such that the Kleisli\ncategory of $\\mathcal Z$ is isomorphic to the premonoidal centre (in the sense\nof Power and Robinson) of the Kleisli category of $\\mathcal T$.

We also provide a computational interpretation of our ideas\nwhich consists in giving a refinement of Moggi's monadic metalanguage. The\nadded benefit is that this allows us to immediately establish a large class of\ncontextually equivalent programs for computational effects that are described\nvia monads that admit a non-trivial centre by simply considering the richer\nsyntactic structure provided by the refinement.",

This may result in high risks in data loss since the required\ntools might not be available due to the high uncertainty in far future. To\naddress this issue, we propose in this paper a self-contained DNA storage\nsystem that can bring self-explanatory to its stored data without relying on\nany external tool. To this end, we design a specific DNA file format whereby a\nseparate storage scheme is developed to reduce the data redundancy while an\neffective indexing is designed for random read operations to the stored data\nfile. We verified through experimental data that the proposed self-contained\nand self-explanatory method can not only get rid of the reliance on external\ntools for data restoration but also minimise the data redundancy brought about\nwhen the amount of data to be stored reaches a certain scale.",

We give matching upper and lower quadratic bounds for the time\ncomplexity of this problem. Further, we consider a series of algorithmic\nproblems in this setting, in which, for given integers $k$, $p$ and a word $w$,\nwe analyse the set $p$-Subseq$_{k}(w)$ of all words of length $k$ which occur\nas subsequence of some factor of length $p$ of $w$. Among these, we consider\nthe $k$-universality problem, the $k$-equivalence problem, as well as problems\nrelated to absent subsequences. Surprisingly, unlike the case of the classical\nmodel of subsequences in words where such problems have efficient solutions in\ngeneral, we show that most of these problems become intractable in the new\nsetting when subsequences in bounded ranges are considered.

Existing defenses mainly rely on Byzantine-robust FL\nmethods, which aim to learn an accurate global model even if some clients are\nmalicious. However, they can only resist a small number of malicious clients in\npractice. It is still an open challenge how to defend against model poisoning\nattacks with a large number of malicious clients. Our FLDetector addresses this\nchallenge via detecting malicious clients. FLDetector aims to detect and remove\nthe majority of the malicious clients such that a Byzantine-robust FL method\ncan learn an accurate global model using the remaining clients. Our key\nobservation is that, in model poisoning attacks, the model updates from a\nclient in multiple iterations are inconsistent. Therefore, FLDetector detects\nmalicious clients via checking their model-updates consistency. Roughly\nspeaking, the server predicts a client's model update in each iteration based\non its historical model updates using the Cauchy mean value theorem and L-BFGS,\nand flags a client as malicious if the received model update from the client\nand the predicted model update are inconsistent in multiple iterations. Our\nextensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that FLDetector can\naccurately detect malicious clients in multiple state-of-the-art model\npoisoning attacks.

According to the\nstatistics, it has reached nearly 18 billion USD, taking the third place of the\nwhole cryptocurrency market, following Bitcoin and Ethereum. Loopholes,\nhowever, are hiding in the shadows. EOSBet, a famous gambling DApp, was\nattacked twice within a month and lost more than 1 million USD. No existing\nwork has surveyed the EOSIO from a security researcher perspective. To fill\nthis gap, in this paper, we collected all occurred attack events against EOSIO,\nand systematically studied their root causes, i.e., vulnerabilities lurked in\nall relying components for EOSIO, as well as the corresponding attacks and\nmitigations. We also summarized some best practices for DApp developers, EOSIO\nofficial team, and security researchers for future directions.",

    "abstract": "Since the first success of Dong et al., the deep-learning-based approach has\nbecome dominant in the field of single-image super-resolution. This replaces\nall the handcrafted image processing steps of traditional sparse-coding-based\nmethods with a deep neural network. In contrast to sparse-coding-based methods,\nwhich explicitly create high/low-resolution dictionaries, the dictionaries in\ndeep-learning-based methods are implicitly acquired as a nonlinear combination\nof multiple convolutions. One disadvantage of deep-learning-based methods is\nthat their performance is degraded for images created differently from the\ntraining dataset (out-of-domain images). We propose an end-to-end\nsuper-resolution network with a deep dictionary (SRDD), where a high-resolution\ndictionary is explicitly learned without sacrificing the advantages of deep\nlearning. Extensive experiments show that explicit learning of high-resolution\ndictionary makes the network more robust for out-of-domain test images while\nmaintaining the performance of the in-domain test images.",

    "abstract": "We examine federated learning (FL) with over-the-air (OTA) aggregation, where\nmobile users (MUs) aim to reach a consensus on a global model with the help of\na parameter server (PS) that aggregates the local gradients. In OTA FL, MUs\ntrain their models using local data at every training round and transmit their\ngradients simultaneously using the same frequency band in an uncoded fashion.\nBased on the received signal of the superposed gradients, the PS performs a\nglobal model update. While the OTA FL has a significantly decreased\ncommunication cost, it is susceptible to adverse channel effects and noise.\nEmploying multiple antennas at the receiver side can reduce these effects, yet\nthe path-loss is still a limiting factor for users located far away from the\nPS. To ameliorate this issue, in this paper, we propose a wireless-based\nhierarchical FL scheme that uses intermediate servers (ISs) to form clusters at\nthe areas where the MUs are more densely located. Our scheme utilizes OTA\ncluster aggregations for the communication of the MUs with their corresponding\nIS, and OTA global aggregations from the ISs to the PS. We present a\nconvergence analysis for the proposed algorithm, and show through numerical\nevaluations of the derived analytical expressions and experimental results that\nutilizing ISs results in a faster convergence and a better performance than the\nOTA FL alone while using less transmit power. We also validate the results on\nthe performance using different number of cluster iterations with different\ndatasets and data distributions. We conclude that the best choice of cluster\naggregations depends on the data distribution among the MUs and the clusters.",

Nevertheless, most of existing works focus on designing advanced\nnetwork architectures to map the feature difference to the final change map\nwhile ignoring the influence of the quality of the feature difference. In this\npaper, we study the CD from a new perspective, i.e., how to optimize the\nfeature difference to highlight changes and suppress unchanged regions, and\npropose a novel module denoted as iterative difference-enhanced transformers\n(IDET). IDET contains three transformers: two transformers for extracting the\nlong-range information of the two images and one transformer for enhancing the\nfeature difference. In contrast to the previous transformers, the third\ntransformer takes the outputs of the first two transformers to guide the\nenhancement of the feature difference iteratively. To achieve more effective\nrefinement, we further propose the multi-scale IDET-based change detection that\nuses multi-scale representations of the images for multiple feature difference\nrefinements and proposes a coarse-to-fine fusion strategy to combine all\nrefinements.

A^2 starts by decomposing a\ncomplex task into subtasks, and then provides the correct orders of subtasks to\nlearn.

Benefiting from its gigantic image-text training\nset, the CLIP model has learned outstanding capabilities in zero-shot learning\nand image-text matching. To boost the recognition performance of CLIP on some\ntarget visual concepts, it is often desirable to further update the CLIP model\nby fine-tuning some classes-of-interest on extra training data. This operation,\nhowever, raises an important concern: will the update hurt the zero-shot\nlearning or image-text matching capability of the CLIP, i.e., the catastrophic\nforgetting issue? If yes, could existing continual learning algorithms be\nadapted to alleviate the risk of catastrophic forgetting? To answer these\nquestions, this work conducts a systemic study on the continual learning issue\nof the CLIP model. We construct evaluation protocols to measure the impact of\nfine-tuning updates and explore different ways to upgrade existing continual\nlearning methods to mitigate the forgetting issue of the CLIP model. Our study\nreveals the particular challenges of CLIP continual learning problem and lays a\nfoundation for further researches.

Due to the black-box property and\nvarious types of CAVs, how to test and evaluate CAVs adaptively remains a major\nchallenge. Many approaches have been proposed to adaptively generate testing\nscenarios during the testing process. However, most existing approaches cannot\nbe applied to complex scenarios, where the variables needed to define such\nscenarios are high dimensional. Towards filling this gap, the adaptive testing\nwith sparse control variates method is proposed in this paper. Instead of\nadaptively generating testing scenarios, our approach evaluates CAVs'\nperformances by adaptively utilizing the testing results. Specifically, each\ntesting result is adjusted using multiple linear regression techniques based on\ncontrol variates. As the regression coefficients can be adaptively optimized\nfor the CAV under test, using the adjusted results can reduce the estimation\nvariance, compared with using the testing results directly. To overcome the\nhigh dimensionality challenge, sparse control variates are utilized only for\nthe critical variables of testing scenarios. To validate the proposed method,\nthe high-dimensional overtaking scenarios are investigated, and the results\ndemonstrate that our approach can further accelerate the evaluation process by\nabout 30 times.",

Since existing AQA datasets do not provide temporal\npart-level labels or partitions, we propose two novel loss functions on the\ncross attention responses of the decoder: a ranking loss to ensure the\nlearnable queries to satisfy the temporal order in cross attention and a\nsparsity loss to encourage the part representations to be more discriminative.\nExtensive experiments show that our proposed method outperforms prior work on\nthree public AQA benchmarks by a considerable margin.",

    "abstract": "Universal domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer the knowledge of common\nclasses from source domain to target domain without any prior knowledge on the\nlabel set, which requires to distinguish the unknown samples from the known\nones in the target domain. Recent methods preferred to increase the\ninter-sample affinity within a known class, while they ignored the inter-sample\naffinity between the unknown samples and the known ones. This paper reveals\nthat exploiting such inter-sample affinity can significantly improve the\nperformance of UDA and proposes a knowability-aware UDA framework based on it.\nFirst, we estimate the knowability of each target sample by searching its\nneighboring samples in the source domain. Then, we propose an auto-thresholding\nscheme applied to the estimated knowability to determine whether a target\nsample is unknown or known. Next, in addition to increasing the inter-sample\naffinity within each known class like previous methods, we design new losses\nbased on the estimated knowability to reduce the inter-sample affinity between\nthe unknown target samples and the known ones. Finally, experiments on four\npublic datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Numerical exceptions, which may be caused by overflow, operations like\ndivision by 0 or sqrt(-1), or convergence failures, are unavoidable in many\ncases, in particular when software is used on unforeseen and difficult inputs.\nAs more aspects of society become automated, e.g., self-driving cars, health\nmonitors, and cyber-physical systems more generally, it is becoming\nincreasingly important to design software that is resilient to exceptions, and\nthat responds to them in a consistent way. Consistency is needed to allow users\nto build higher-level software that is also resilient and consistent (and so on\nrecursively). In this paper we explore the design space of consistent exception\nhandling for the widely used BLAS and LAPACK linear algebra libraries, pointing\nout a variety of instances of inconsistent exception handling in the current\nversions, and propose a new design that balances consistency, complexity, ease\nof use, and performance. Some compromises are needed, because there are\npreexisting inconsistencies that are outside our control, including in or\nbetween existing vendor BLAS implementations, different programming languages,\nand even compilers for the same programming language. And user requests from\nour surveys are quite diverse. We also propose our design as a possible model\nfor other numerical software, and welcome comments on our design choices.",

    "abstract": "Facebook and other advertising platforms exploit users data for marketing\npurposes by allowing advertisers to select specific users and target them (the\npractice is being called micro-targeting). However, advertisers such as\nCambridge Analytica have maliciously used these targeting features to\nmanipulate users in the context of elections. The European Commission plans to\nrestrict or ban some targeting functionalities in the new European Democracy\nAction Plan act to protect users from such harms. The difficulty is that we do\nnot know the economic impact of these restrictions on regular advertisers. In\nthis paper, to inform the debate, we take a first step by understanding who is\nadvertising on Facebook and how they use the targeting functionalities. For\nthis, we asked 890 U.S. users to install a monitoring tool on their browsers to\ncollect the ads they receive on Facebook and information about how these ads\nwere targeted. By matching advertisers on Facebook with their LinkedIn\nprofiles, we could see that 71% of advertisers are small and medium-sized\nbusinesses with 200 employees or less, and they are responsible for 61% of ads\nand 57% of ad impressions. Regarding micro-targeting, we found that only 32% of\nsmall and medium-sized businesses and 30% of large-sized businesses\nmicro-target at least one of their ads. These results should not be interpreted\nas micro-targeting not being useful as a marketing strategy, but rather that\nadvertisers prefer to outsource the micro-targeting task to ad platforms.\nIndeed, Facebook is employing optimization algorithms that exploit user data to\ndecide which users should see what ads; which means ad platforms are performing\nan algorithmic-driven micro-targeting. Hence, when setting restrictions,\nlegislators should take into account both the traditional advertiser-driven\nmicro-targeting as well as algorithmic-driven micro-targeting performed by ad\nplatforms.",

We propose a novel approach, Magpie, which utilizes deep\nreinforcement learning to tune static parameters by strategically exploring and\nexploiting configuration parameter spaces. To boost the tuning of the static\nparameters, our method employs both server and client metrics of distributed\nfile systems to understand the relationship between static parameters and\nperformance. Our empirical evaluation results show that Magpie can noticeably\nimprove the performance of the distributed file system Lustre, where our\napproach on average achieves 91.8% throughput gains against default\nconfiguration after tuning towards single performance indicator optimization,\nwhile it reaches 39.7% more throughput gains against the baseline.",

To solve this problem, we propose a robot learning\napproach to actively interact with novel objects and collect each object's\ntraining label for further fine-tuning to improve the segmentation model\nperformance, while avoiding the time-consuming process of manually labeling a\ndataset.

We decompose the problem into three\nsubtasks: (1) the object singulation subtask aims to separate the objects from\neach other, which creates more space that alleviates the difficulty of (2) the\ncollision-free grasping subtask; (3) the mask generation subtask to obtain the\nself-labeled ground truth masks by using an optical flow-based binary\nclassifier and motion cue post-processing for transfer learning.

By\nintroducing distributed ledgers (DLs), it is also possible to create\ndecentralized registries.

While this ensures trustworthy information, the process requires\nthe verifier to be online and the ledger node available. Additionally, the\nconnection from the verifier to the registry poses a privacy issue, as it leaks\ninformation about the user's behavior.\nIn this paper, we resolve these issues by extending existing ledger APIs to\nsupport results that are trustworthy even in an offline setting. We do this by\nintroducing attestations of the ledger's state, issued by ledger nodes,\naggregatable into a collective attestation by all nodes. This attestation\nenables a user to prove the provenance of DL-based data to an offline verifier.\nOur approach is generic.

    "abstract": "Interpreting the performance results of models that attempt to realize user\nbehavior in platforms that employ recommenders is a big challenge that\nresearchers and practitioners continue to face. Although current evaluation\ntools possess the capacity to provide solid general overview of a system's\nperformance, they still lack consistency and effectiveness in their use as\nevident in most recent studies on the topic. Current traditional assessment\ntechniques tend to fail to detect variations that could occur on smaller\nsubsets of the data and lack the ability to explain how such variations affect\nthe overall performance. In this article, we focus on the concept of data\nclustering for evaluation in recommenders and apply a neighborhood assessment\nmethod for the datasets of recommender system applications. This new method,\nnamed neighborhood-based evaluation, aids in better understanding critical\nperformance variations in more compact subsets of the system to help spot\nweaknesses where such variations generally go unnoticed with conventional\nmetrics and are typically averaged out. This new modular evaluation layer\ncomplements the existing assessment mechanisms and provides the possibility of\nseveral applications to the recommender ecosystem such as model evolution\ntests, fraud/attack detection and a possibility for hosting a hybrid model\nsetup.",

    "abstract": "Since Intersection-over-Union (IoU) based optimization maintains the\nconsistency of the final IoU prediction metric and losses, it has been widely\nused in both regression and classification branches of single-stage 2D object\ndetectors. Recently, several 3D object detection methods adopt IoU-based\noptimization and directly replace the 2D IoU with 3D IoU. However, such a\ndirect computation in 3D is very costly due to the complex implementation and\ninefficient backward operations. Moreover, 3D IoU-based optimization is\nsub-optimal as it is sensitive to rotation and thus can cause training\ninstability and detection performance deterioration. In this paper, we propose\na novel Rotation-Decoupled IoU (RDIoU) method that can mitigate the\nrotation-sensitivity issue, and produce more efficient optimization objectives\ncompared with 3D IoU during the training stage. Specifically, our RDIoU\nsimplifies the complex interactions of regression parameters by decoupling the\nrotation variable as an independent term, yet preserving the geometry of 3D\nIoU. By incorporating RDIoU into both the regression and classification\nbranches, the network is encouraged to learn more precise bounding boxes and\nconcurrently overcome the misalignment issue between classification and\nregression. Extensive experiments on the benchmark KITTI and Waymo Open Dataset\nvalidate that our RDIoU method can bring substantial improvement for the\nsingle-stage 3D object detection.",

    "abstract": "Simulation is an important step in robotics for creating control policies and\ntesting various physical parameters. Soft robotics is a field that presents\nunique physical challenges for simulating its subjects due to the nonlinearity\nof deformable material components along with other innovative, and often\ncomplex, physical properties. Because of the computational cost of simulating\nsoft and heterogeneous objects with traditional techniques, rigid robotics\nsimulators are not well suited to simulating soft robots. Thus, many engineers\nmust build their own one-off simulators tailored to their system, or use\nexisting simulators with reduced performance. In order to facilitate the\ndevelopment of this exciting technology, this work presents an\ninteractive-speed, accurate, and versatile simulator for a variety of types of\nsoft robots. Cronos, our open-source 3D simulation engine, parallelizes a\nmass-spring model for ultra-fast performance on both deformable and rigid\nobjects. Our approach is applicable to a wide array of nonlinear material\nconfigurations, including high deformability, volumetric actuation, or\nheterogenous stiffness. This versatility provides the ability to mix materials\nand geometric components freely within a single robot simulation. By exploiting\nthe flexibility and scalability of nonlinear Hookean mass-spring systems, this\nframework simulates soft and rigid objects via a highly parallel model for near\nreal-time speed. We describe an efficient GPU CUDA implementation, which we\ndemonstrate to achieve computation of over 1 billion elements per second on\nconsumer-grade GPU cards. Dynamic physical accuracy of the system is validated\nby comparing results to Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, natural frequency\npredictions, and empirical data of a soft structure under large deformation.",

In contrastive learning, the network is\npresented with pairs of positive (similar) and negative (dissimilar) datapoints\nand is trained to find an embedding vector for each datapoint, i.e., a\nrepresentation, which can be further fine-tuned for various downstream tasks.\nIn order to safely deploy these models in critical decision-making systems, it\nis crucial to equip them with a measure of their uncertainty or reliability.\nHowever, due to the pairwise nature of training a contrastive model, and the\nlack of absolute labels on the output (an abstract embedding vector), adapting\nconventional uncertainty estimation techniques to such models is non-trivial.\nIn this work, we study whether the uncertainty of such a representation can be\nquantified for a single datapoint in a meaningful way.

    "abstract": "Visual representation learning is the key of solving various vision problems.\nRelying on the seminal grid structure priors, convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) have been the de facto standard architectures of most deep vision\nmodels. For instance, classical semantic segmentation methods often adopt a\nfully-convolutional network (FCN) with an encoder-decoder architecture. The\nencoder progressively reduces the spatial resolution and learns more abstract\nvisual concepts with larger receptive fields. Since context modeling is\ncritical for segmentation, the latest efforts have been focused on increasing\nthe receptive field, through either dilated (i.e., atrous) convolutions or\ninserting attention modules. However, the FCN-based architecture remains\nunchanged. In this paper, we aim to provide an alternative perspective by\ntreating visual representation learning generally as a sequence-to-sequence\nprediction task. Specifically, we deploy a pure Transformer to encode an image\nas a sequence of patches, without local convolution and resolution reduction.\nWith the global context modeled in every layer of the Transformer, stronger\nvisual representation can be learned for better tackling vision tasks. In\nparticular, our segmentation model, termed as SEgmentation TRansformer (SETR),\nexcels on ADE20K (50.28% mIoU, the first position in the test leaderboard on\nthe day of submission), Pascal Context (55.83% mIoU) and reaches competitive\nresults on Cityscapes. Further, we formulate a family of Hierarchical\nLocal-Global (HLG) Transformers characterized by local attention within windows\nand global-attention across windows in a hierarchical and pyramidal\narchitecture. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves appealing\nperformance on a variety of visual recognition tasks (e.g., image\nclassification, object detection and instance segmentation and semantic\nsegmentation).",

The\nproblem of compressed sensing with GNNs has since been extensively analyzed\nwhen the measurement matrix and/or network weights follow a subgaussian\ndistribution. We move beyond the subgaussian assumption, to measurement\nmatrices that are derived by sampling uniformly at random rows of a unitary\nmatrix (including subsampled Fourier measurements as a special case).\nSpecifically, we prove the first known restricted isometry guarantee for\ngenerative compressed sensing with subsampled isometries, and provide recovery\nbounds with nearly order-optimal sample complexity, addressing an open problem\nof Scarlett et al.

Our approach relies on subspace\ncounting arguments and ideas central to high-dimensional probability.\nFurthermore, we propose a regularization strategy for training GNNs to have\nfavourable coherence with the measurement operator. We provide compelling\nnumerical simulations that support this regularized training strategy: our\nstrategy yields low coherence networks that require fewer measurements for\nsignal recovery.

    "title": "Data-Centric Epidemic Forecasting: A Survey",
    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has brought forth the importance of epidemic\nforecasting for decision makers in multiple domains, ranging from public health\nto the economy as a whole. While forecasting epidemic progression is frequently\nconceptualized as being analogous to weather forecasting, however it has some\nkey differences and remains a non-trivial task. The spread of diseases is\nsubject to multiple confounding factors spanning human behavior, pathogen\ndynamics, weather and environmental conditions. Research interest has been\nfueled by the increased availability of rich data sources capturing previously\nunobservable facets and also due to initiatives from government public health\nand funding agencies. This has resulted, in particular, in a spate of work on\n'data-centered' solutions which have shown potential in enhancing our\nforecasting capabilities by leveraging non-traditional data sources as well as\nrecent innovations in AI and machine learning. This survey delves into various\ndata-driven methodological and practical advancements and introduces a\nconceptual framework to navigate through them. First, we enumerate the large\nnumber of epidemiological datasets and novel data streams that are relevant to\nepidemic forecasting, capturing various factors like symptomatic online\nsurveys, retail and commerce, mobility, genomics data and more. Next, we\ndiscuss methods and modeling paradigms focusing on the recent data-driven\nstatistical and deep-learning based methods as well as on the novel class of\nhybrid models that combine domain knowledge of mechanistic models with the\neffectiveness and flexibility of statistical approaches. We also discuss\nexperiences and challenges that arise in real-world deployment of these\nforecasting systems including decision-making informed by forecasts. Finally,\nwe highlight some challenges and open problems found across the forecasting\npipeline.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) allows for collaboratively aggregating learned\ninformation across several computing devices and sharing the same amongst them,\nthereby tackling issues of privacy and the need of huge bandwidth. FL\ntechniques generally use a central server or cloud for aggregating the models\nreceived from the devices. Such centralized FL techniques suffer from inherent\nproblems such as failure of the central node and bottlenecks in channel\nbandwidth. When FL is used in conjunction with connected robots serving as\ndevices, a failure of the central controlling entity can lead to a chaotic\nsituation. This paper describes a mobile agent based paradigm to decentralize\nFL in multi-robot scenarios. Using Webots, a popular free open-source robot\nsimulator, and Tartarus, a mobile agent platform, we present a methodology to\ndecentralize federated learning in a set of connected robots. With Webots\nrunning on different connected computing systems, we show how mobile agents can\nperform the task of Decentralized Federated Reinforcement Learning (dFRL).\nResults obtained from experiments carried out using Q-learning and SARSA by\naggregating their corresponding Q-tables, show the viability of using\ndecentralized FL in the domain of robotics. Since the proposed work can be used\nin conjunction with other learning algorithms and also real robots, it can act\nas a vital tool for the study of decentralized FL using heterogeneous learning\nalgorithms concurrently in multi-robot scenarios.",

However, all\ncommon approaches from this field are based on communicating information about\nfeatures or characteristics that are especially important for an AI's decision.\nWe argue that in order to fully understand a decision, not only knowledge about\nrelevant features is needed, but that the awareness of irrelevant information\nalso highly contributes to the creation of a user's mental model of an AI\nsystem. Therefore, we introduce a new way of explaining AI systems. Our\napproach, which we call Alterfactual Explanations, is based on showing an\nalternative reality where irrelevant features of an AI's input are altered. By\ndoing so, the user directly sees which characteristics of the input data can\nchange arbitrarily without influencing the AI's decision. We evaluate our\napproach in an extensive user study, revealing that it is able to significantly\ncontribute to the participants' understanding of an AI.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a highly robust third-order accurate finite volume\nweighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) method for special relativistic\nhydrodynamics on unstructured triangular meshes. We rigorously prove that the\nproposed method is physical-constraint-preserving (PCP), namely, always\npreserves the positivity of the pressure and the rest-mass density as well as\nthe subluminal constraint on the fluid velocity. The method is built on a\nhighly efficient compact WENO reconstruction on unstructured meshes, a simple\nPCP limiter, the provably PCP property of the Harten--Lax--van Leer flux, and\nthird-order strong-stability-preserving time discretization. Due to the\nrelativistic effects, the primitive variables (namely, the rest-mass density,\nvelocity, and pressure) are highly nonlinear implicit functions in terms of the\nconservative variables, making the design and analysis of our method\nnontrivial. To address the difficulties arising from the strong nonlinearity,\nwe adopt a novel quasilinear technique for the theoretical proof of the PCP\nproperty. Three provable convergence-guaranteed iterative algorithms are also\nintroduced for the robust recovery of primitive quantities from admissible\nconservative variables. We also propose a slight modification to an existing\nWENO reconstruction to ensure the scaling invariance of the nonlinear weights\nand thus to accommodate the homogeneity of the evolution operator, leading to\nthe advantages of the modified WENO reconstruction in resolving multi-scale\nwave structures. Extensive numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the\nrobustness, expected accuracy, and high resolution of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a green, quantized FL framework, which represents data with a\nfinite precision level in both local training and uplink transmission, is\nproposed. Here, the finite precision level is captured through the use of\nquantized neural networks (QNNs) that quantize weights and activations in\nfixed-precision format. In the considered FL model, each device trains its QNN\nand transmits a quantized training result to the base station. Energy models\nfor the local training and the transmission with quantization are rigorously\nderived. To minimize the energy consumption and the number of communication\nrounds simultaneously, a multi-objective optimization problem is formulated\nwith respect to the number of local iterations, the number of selected devices,\nand the precision levels for both local training and transmission while\nensuring convergence under a target accuracy constraint. To solve this problem,\nthe convergence rate of the proposed FL system is analytically derived with\nrespect to the system control variables. Then, the Pareto boundary of the\nproblem is characterized to provide efficient solutions using the normal\nboundary inspection method. Design insights on balancing the tradeoff between\nthe two objectives are drawn from using the Nash bargaining solution and\nanalyzing the derived convergence rate. Simulation results show that the\nproposed FL framework can reduce energy consumption until convergence by up to\n52% compared to a baseline FL algorithm that represents data with full\nprecision.",

    "abstract": "This paper designs and analyzes positivity-preserving well-balanced (WB)\ncentral discontinuous Galerkin (CDG) schemes for the Euler equations with\ngravity. A distinctive feature of these schemes is that they not only are WB\nfor a general known stationary hydrostatic solution, but also can preserve the\npositivity of the fluid density and pressure. The standard CDG method does not\npossess this feature, while directly applying some existing WB techniques to\nthe CDG framework may not accommodate the positivity and keep other important\nproperties at the same time. In order to obtain the WB and\npositivity-preserving properties simultaneously while also maintaining the\nconservativeness and stability of the schemes, a novel spatial discretization\nis devised in the CDG framework based on suitable modifications to the\nnumerical dissipation term and the source term approximation. The modifications\nare based on a crucial projection operator for the stationary hydrostatic\nsolution, which is proposed for the first time in this work. This novel\nprojection has the same order of accuracy as the standard $L^2$-projection, can\nbe explicitly calculated, and is easy to implement without solving any\noptimization problems. More importantly, it ensures that the projected\nstationary solution has the same cell averages on both the primal and dual\nmeshes, which is a key to achieve the desired properties of our schemes. Based\non some convex decomposition techniques, rigorous positivity-preserving\nanalyses for the resulting WB CDG schemes are carried out. Several one- and\ntwo-dimensional numerical examples are performed to illustrate the desired\nproperties of these schemes, including the high-order accuracy, the WB\nproperty, the robustness for simulations involving the low pressure or density,\nhigh resolution for the discontinuous solutions and the small perturbations\naround the equilibrium state.",

Despite a wide variety of lane detection approaches have been\nproposed, reporting steady benchmark improvements over time, lane detection\nremains a largely unsolved problem. This is because most of the existing lane\ndetection methods either treat the lane detection as a dense prediction or a\ndetection task, few of them consider the unique topologies (Y-shape,\nFork-shape, nearly horizontal lane) of the lane markers, which leads to\nsub-optimal solution. In this paper, we present a new method for lane detection\nbased on relay chain prediction. Specifically, our model predicts a\nsegmentation map to classify the foreground and background region. For each\npixel point in the foreground region, we go through the forward branch and\nbackward branch to recover the whole lane.

    "abstract": "Estimating the Generalization Error (GE) of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is an\nimportant task that often relies on availability of held-out data. The ability\nto better predict GE based on a single training set may yield overarching DNN\ndesign principles to reduce a reliance on trial-and-error, along with other\nperformance assessment advantages. In search of a quantity relevant to GE, we\ninvestigate the Mutual Information (MI) between the input and final layer\nrepresentations, using the infinite-width DNN limit to bound MI. An existing\ninput compression-based GE bound is used to link MI and GE. To the best of our\nknowledge, this represents the first empirical study of this bound. In our\nattempt to empirically falsify the theoretical bound, we find that it is often\ntight for best-performing models. Furthermore, it detects randomization of\ntraining labels in many cases, reflects test-time perturbation robustness, and\nworks well given only few training samples. These results are promising given\nthat input compression is broadly applicable where MI can be estimated with\nconfidence.",

    "abstract": "Accurate 3D object detection with LiDAR is critical for autonomous driving.\nExisting research is all based on the flat-world assumption. However, the\nactual road can be complex with steep sections, which breaks the premise.\nCurrent methods suffer from performance degradation in this case due to\ndifficulty correctly detecting objects on sloped terrain. In this work, we\npropose Det6D, the first full-degree-of-freedom 3D object detector without\nspatial and postural limitations, to improve terrain robustness. We choose the\npoint-based framework by founding their capability of detecting objects in the\nentire spatial range. To predict full-degree poses, including pitch and roll,\nwe design a ground-aware orientation branch that leverages the local ground\nconstraints. Given the difficulty of long-tail non-flat scene data collection\nand 6D pose annotation, we present Slope-Aug, a data augmentation method for\nsynthesizing non-flat terrain from existing datasets recorded in flat scenes.\nExperiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of\nour method in different terrains. We further conducted an extended experiment\nto explore how the network predicts the two extra poses. The proposed modules\nare plug-and-play for existing point-based frameworks.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning aims at training a global model from multiple\ndecentralized devices (i.e. clients) without exchanging their private local\ndata. A key challenge is the handling of non-i.i.d. (independent identically\ndistributed) data across multiple clients that may induce disparities of their\nlocal features. We introduce the Hyperspherical Federated Learning (SphereFed)\nframework to address the non-i.i.d. issue by constraining learned\nrepresentations of data points to be on a unit hypersphere shared by clients.\nSpecifically, all clients learn their local representations by minimizing the\nloss with respect to a fixed classifier whose weights span the unit\nhypersphere. After federated training in improving the global model, this\nclassifier is further calibrated with a closed-form solution by minimizing a\nmean squared loss. We show that the calibration solution can be computed\nefficiently and distributedly without direct access of local data. Extensive\nexperiments indicate that our SphereFed approach is able to improve the\naccuracy of multiple existing federated learning algorithms by a considerable\nmargin (up to 6% on challenging datasets) with enhanced computation and\ncommunication efficiency across datasets and model architectures.",

    "abstract": "We study the design of prior-independent auctions in a setting with\nheterogeneous bidders. In particular, we consider the setting of selling to $n$\nbidders whose values are drawn from $n$ independent but not necessarily\nidentical distributions. We work in the robust auction design regime, where we\nassume the seller has no knowledge of the bidders' value distributions and must\ndesign a mechanism that is prior-independent. While there have been many strong\nresults on prior-independent auction design in the i.i.d. setting, not much is\nknown for the heterogeneous setting, even though the latter is of significant\npractical importance. Unfortunately, no prior-independent mechanism can hope to\nalways guarantee any approximation to Myerson's revenue in the heterogeneous\nsetting; similarly, no prior-independent mechanism can consistently do better\nthan the second-price auction. In light of this, we design a family of\n(parametrized) randomized auctions which approximates at least one of these\nbenchmarks: For heterogeneous bidders with regular value distributions, our\nmechanisms either achieve a good approximation of the expected revenue of an\noptimal mechanism (which knows the bidders' distributions) or exceeds that of\nthe second-price auction by a certain multiplicative factor. The factor in the\nlatter case naturally trades off with the approximation ratio of the former\ncase. We show that our mechanism is optimal for such a trade-off between the\ntwo cases by establishing a matching lower bound. Our result extends to selling\n$k$ identical items to heterogeneous bidders with an additional $O\\big(\\ln^2\nk\\big)$-factor in our trade-off between the two cases.",

In practice, these\ncost/value quantities often come through processes such as measurement or\nmachine learning, which are noisy, with quantifiable noise distributions. To\ntake these noise distributions into account, one approach is to assume a prior\nfor the values, use it to build a posterior, and then apply standard stochastic\noptimization to pick a solution. However, in many practical applications, such\nprior distributions may not be available. In this paper, we study such\nscenarios using a regret minimization model.\nIn our model, the task is to pick the highest one out of $n$ values. The\nvalues are unknown and chosen by an adversary, but can be observed through\nnoisy channels, where additive noises are stochastically drawn from known\ndistributions. The goal is to minimize the regret of our selection, defined as\nthe expected difference between the highest and the selected value on the\nworst-case choices of values. We show that the na\\\"ive algorithm of picking the\nhighest observed value has regret arbitrarily worse than the optimum, even when\n$n = 2$ and the noises are unbiased in expectation. On the other hand, we\npropose an algorithm which gives a constant-approximation to the optimal regret\nfor any $n$.

We show that we can accurately reproduce the MC dynamics as well\nas generalize along the two important axes of particle number and particle\ndensity. This paves the way to model much larger systems beyond the limits of\ntraditional MC methods. While the exact system is inspired by the dynamics of\nRydberg atoms, the approach is quite general and can readily be applied to\nother systems.",

White matter parcellation\nclassifies tractography streamlines into clusters or anatomically meaningful\ntracts. It enables quantification and visualization of whole-brain\ntractography. Currently, most parcellation methods focus on the deep white\nmatter (DWM), whereas fewer methods address the superficial white matter (SWM)\ndue to its complexity. We propose a novel two-stage deep-learning-based\nframework, Superficial White Matter Analysis (SupWMA), that performs an\nefficient and consistent parcellation of 198 SWM clusters from whole-brain\ntractography. A point-cloud-based network is adapted to our SWM parcellation\ntask, and supervised contrastive learning enables more discriminative\nrepresentations between plausible streamlines and outliers for SWM. We train\nour model on a large-scale tractography dataset including streamline samples\nfrom labeled SWM clusters and anatomically implausible streamline samples, and\nwe perform testing on six independently acquired datasets of different ages and\nhealth conditions (including neonates and patients with space-occupying brain\ntumors). Compared to several state-of-the-art methods, SupWMA obtains highly\nconsistent and accurate SWM parcellation results on all datasets, showing good\ngeneralization across the lifespan in health and disease.

To avert a\nchain reaction of collisions, termed Kessler Syndrome, it is indispensable to\naccurately track and predict space debris and satellites' orbit alike. Current\nphysics-based methods have errors in the order of kilometres for 7 days\npredictions, which is insufficient when considering space debris that have\nmostly less than 1 meter.

    "abstract": "Millimeter wave communications require multibeam beamforming in order to\nutilize wireless channels that suffer from obstructions, path loss, and\nmulti-path effects. Digital multibeam beamforming has maximum degrees of\nfreedom compared to analog phased arrays. However, circuit complexity and power\nconsumption are important constraints for digital multibeam systems. A\nlow-complexity digital computing architecture is proposed for a\nmultiplication-free 32-point linear transform that approximates multiple\nsimultaneous RF beams similar to a discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Arithmetic\ncomplexity due to multiplication is reduced from the FFT complexity of\n$\\mathcal{O}(N\\: \\log N)$ for DFT realizations, down to zero, thus yielding a\n46% and 55% reduction in chip area and dynamic power consumption, respectively,\nfor the $N=32$ case considered. The paper describes the proposed 32-point DFT\napproximation targeting a 1024-beams using a 2D array, and shows the\nmultiplierless approximation and its mapping to a 32-beam sub-system consisting\nof 5.8 GHz antennas that can be used for generating 1024 digital beams without\nmultiplications. Real-time beam computation is achieved using a Xilinx FPGA at\n120 MHz bandwidth per beam. Theoretical beam performance is compared with\nmeasured RF patterns from both a fixed-point FFT as well as the proposed\nmultiplier-free algorithm and are in good agreement.",

    "abstract": "As opaque predictive models increasingly impact many areas of modern life,\ninterest in quantifying the importance of a given input variable for making a\nspecific prediction has grown. Recently, there has been a proliferation of\nmodel-agnostic methods to measure variable importance (VI) that analyze the\ndifference in predictive power between a full model trained on all variables\nand a reduced model that excludes the variable(s) of interest. A bottleneck\ncommon to these methods is the estimation of the reduced model for each\nvariable (or subset of variables), which is an expensive process that often\ndoes not come with theoretical guarantees. In this work, we propose a fast and\nflexible method for approximating the reduced model with important inferential\nguarantees. We replace the need for fully retraining a wide neural network by a\nlinearization initialized at the full model parameters. By adding a ridge-like\npenalty to make the problem convex, we prove that when the ridge penalty\nparameter is sufficiently large, our method estimates the variable importance\nmeasure with an error rate of $O(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}})$ where $n$ is the number\nof training samples. We also show that our estimator is asymptotically normal,\nenabling us to provide confidence bounds for the VI estimates. We demonstrate\nthrough simulations that our method is fast and accurate under several\ndata-generating regimes, and we demonstrate its real-world applicability on a\nseasonal climate forecasting example.",

We first\nrelax the binary variable to continuous variables and employ the Lagrange\nmethod and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions to obtain optimal solutions (optimal\ndecision variables and objective function) and critical regions associated with\nactive and inactive constraints. Further, we extend the traditional branch and\nbound method for the large-scale MILP problem by determining the upper bound of\nthe problem at each node, then comparing the difference between the upper and\nlower bounds and reaching the approximate optimal solution within the decision\nmakers' tolerated error range. In additional, the objective function's first\nderivative on the parameters of each line is used to inform the selection of\nlines to ease congestion and maximize social welfare. Finally, the amount of\ncapacity upgrade will be chosen by balancing the cost-reduction rate of the\nobjective function on parameters and the cost of the line upgrade. Our findings\nare supported by numerical simulation and provide transmission line planners\nwith decision-making guidance.",

This\ntype of problems is gaining popularity in applications such as policy\nevaluation in reinforcement learning or model customization in meta-learning.\nThe standard Riemannian stochastic gradient methods for non-compositional\noptimization cannot be directly applied as stochastic approximation of inner\nfunctions create bias in the gradients of the outer functions. For two-level\ncomposition optimization, we present a Riemannian Stochastic Composition\nGradient Descent (R-SCGD) method that finds an approximate stationary point,\nwith expected squared Riemannian gradient smaller than $\\epsilon$, in\n$O(\\epsilon^{-2})$ calls to the stochastic gradient oracle of the outer\nfunction and stochastic function and gradient oracles of the inner function.\nFurthermore, we generalize the R-SCGD algorithms for problems with multi-level\nnested compositional structures, with the same complexity of $O(\\epsilon^{-2})$\nfor the first-order stochastic oracle. Finally, the performance of the R-SCGD\nmethod is numerically evaluated over a policy evaluation problem in\nreinforcement learning.",

    "title": "Image Synthesis with Disentangled Attributes for Chest X-Ray Nodule  Augmentation and Detection",
    "abstract": "Lung nodule detection in chest X-ray (CXR) images is common to early\nscreening of lung cancers. Deep-learning-based Computer-Assisted Diagnosis\n(CAD) systems can support radiologists for nodule screening in CXR. However, it\nrequires large-scale and diverse medical data with high-quality annotations to\ntrain such robust and accurate CADs. To alleviate the limited availability of\nsuch datasets, lung nodule synthesis methods are proposed for the sake of data\naugmentation. Nevertheless, previous methods lack the ability to generate\nnodules that are realistic with the size attribute desired by the detector. To\naddress this issue, we introduce a novel lung nodule synthesis framework in\nthis paper, which decomposes nodule attributes into three main aspects\nincluding shape, size, and texture, respectively. A GAN-based Shape Generator\nfirstly models nodule shapes by generating diverse shape masks. The following\nSize Modulation then enables quantitative control on the diameters of the\ngenerated nodule shapes in pixel-level granularity. A coarse-to-fine gated\nconvolutional Texture Generator finally synthesizes visually plausible nodule\ntextures conditioned on the modulated shape masks. Moreover, we propose to\nsynthesize nodule CXR images by controlling the disentangled nodule attributes\nfor data augmentation, in order to better compensate for the nodules that are\neasily missed in the detection task. Our experiments demonstrate the enhanced\nimage quality, diversity, and controllability of the proposed lung nodule\nsynthesis framework. We also validate the effectiveness of our data\naugmentation on greatly improving nodule detection performance.",

Motivated by the structural\nsimilarity to deep neural networks, we adopt the concept of algorithm\nunrolling, where training data is used to optimize the algorithm. We design\nunrolled algorithms for several group synchronization instances, including\nsynchronization over the group of 3-D rotations: the synchronization problem in\ncryo-EM.

Supernova (SN) type is defined\nby spectroscopic emission lines, but obtaining spectroscopy is often\nlogistically unfeasible. Thus, the ability to identify SNe by type using\ntime-series image data alone is crucial, especially in light of the increasing\nbreadth and depth of upcoming telescopes. We present a convolutional neural\nnetwork method for fast supernova time-series classification, with observed\nbrightness data smoothed in both the wavelength and time directions with\nGaussian process regression. We apply this method to full duration and\ntruncated SN time-series, to simulate retrospective as well as real-time\nclassification performance. Retrospective classification is used to\ndifferentiate cosmologically useful Type Ia SNe from other SN types, and this\nmethod achieves >99% accuracy on this task. We are also able to differentiate\nbetween 6 SN types with 60% accuracy given only two nights of data and 98%\naccuracy retrospectively.",
