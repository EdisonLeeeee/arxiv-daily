    "title": "AVDDPG: Federated reinforcement learning applied to autonomous platoon  control",
    "abstract": "Since 2016 federated learning (FL) has been an evolving topic of discussion\nin the artificial intelligence (AI) research community. Applications of FL led\nto the development and study of federated reinforcement learning (FRL). Few\nworks exist on the topic of FRL applied to autonomous vehicle (AV) platoons. In\naddition, most FRL works choose a single aggregation method (usually weight or\ngradient aggregation). We explore FRL's effectiveness as a means to improve AV\nplatooning by designing and implementing an FRL framework atop a custom AV\nplatoon environment. The application of FRL in AV platooning is studied under\ntwo scenarios: (1) Inter-platoon FRL (Inter-FRL) where FRL is applied to AVs\nacross different platoons; (2) Intra-platoon FRL (Intra-FRL) where FRL is\napplied to AVs within a single platoon. Both Inter-FRL and Intra-FRL are\napplied to a custom AV platooning environment using both gradient and weight\naggregation to observe the performance effects FRL can have on AV platoons\nrelative to an AV platooning environment trained without FRL. It is concluded\nthat Intra-FRL using weight aggregation (Intra-FRLWA) provides the best\nperformance for controlling an AV platoon. In addition, we found that weight\naggregation in FRL for AV platooning provides increases in performance relative\nto gradient aggregation. Finally, a performance analysis is conducted for\nIntra-FRLWA versus a platooning environment without FRL for platoons of length\n3, 4 and 5 vehicles. It is concluded that Intra-FRLWA largely out-performs the\nplatooning environment that is trained without FRL.",

Multiple images are regarded as an\ninput to decompose the degenerate modes. Total of seven different images,\nincluding the full original near-field image, and images after linear\npolarizers of four directions (0$^\\circ$, 45$^\\circ$, 90$^\\circ$, and\n135$^\\circ$), and images after two circular polarizers (right-handed and\nleft-handed) has been considered for training, validation, and test.

The RMS and mean-absolute-error (MAE) of\nthe label, intensity, phase, and field correlation between the actual and\npredicted values have been selected to be the metrics to evaluate the CNN\nmodel. The CNN model has been trained with 100,000 three-dimensional images\nwith depths of three, four, and seven. The performance of the trained model was\nevaluated via 10,000 test samples with four sets of images - images after three\nlinear polarizers (0$^\\circ$, 45$^\\circ$, 90$^\\circ$) and image after\nright-handed circular polarizer - showed 0.0634 of label RMS, 0.0292 of\nintensity RMS, 0.1867 rad of phase MAE, and 0.9978 of average field\ncorrelation.

    "abstract": "The rapid deployment of renewable generations such as photovoltaic (PV)\ngenerations brings great challenges to the resiliency of existing power\nsystems. Because PV generations are volatile and typically invisible to the\npower system operator, estimating the generation and characterizing the\nuncertainty are in urgent need for operators to make insightful decisions. This\npaper summarizes our recent results on energy disaggregation at the substation\nlevel with Behind-the-Meter solar generation. We formulate the so-called\n``partial label'' problem for energy disaggregation at substations, where the\naggregate measurements contain the total consumption of multiple loads, and the\nexistence of some loads is unknown. We develop two model-free disaggregation\napproaches based on deterministic dictionary learning and Bayesian dictionary\nlearning, respectively. Unlike conventional methods which require fully\nannotated training data of individual loads, our approaches can extract load\npatterns given partially labeled aggregate data. Therefore, our partial label\nformulation is more applicable in the real world. Compared with deterministic\ndictionary learning, the Bayesian dictionary learning-based approach provides\nthe uncertainty measure for the disaggregation results, at the cost of\nincreased computational complexity. All the methods are validated by numerical\nexperiments.",

However, their performance is tied to the domain\nrepresented by the training data. Open world scenarios cause inaccurate\npredictions which is hazardous in safety relevant applications like automated\ndriving. In this work, we enhance semantic segmentation predictions using\nmonocular depth estimation to improve segmentation by reducing the occurrence\nof non-detected objects in presence of domain shift. To this end, we infer a\ndepth heatmap via a modified segmentation network which generates\nforeground-background masks, operating in parallel to a given semantic\nsegmentation network. Both segmentation masks are aggregated with a focus on\nforeground classes (here road users) to reduce false negatives. To also reduce\nthe occurrence of false positives, we apply a pruning based on uncertainty\nestimates. Our approach is modular in a sense that it post-processes the output\nof any semantic segmentation network. In our experiments, we observe less\nnon-detected objects of most important classes and an enhanced generalization\nto other domains compared to the basic semantic segmentation prediction.",

    "abstract": "Within finite element models of fluids, vector-valued fields such as velocity\nor momentum variables are commonly discretised using the Raviart-Thomas\nelements. However, when using the lowest-order quadrilateral Raviart-Thomas\nelements, standard finite element discretisations of the vector transport\nequation typically have a low order of spatial accuracy. This paper describes\ntwo schemes that improve the accuracy of transporting such vector-valued fields\non two-dimensional curved manifolds.\nThe first scheme that is presented reconstructs the transported field in a\nhigher-order function space, where the transport equation is then solved. The\nsecond scheme applies a mixed finite element formulation to the vector\ntransport equation, simultaneously solving for the transported field and its\nvorticity. An approach to stabilising this mixed vector-vorticity formulation\nis presented that uses a Streamline Upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) method. These\nschemes are then demonstrated, along with their accuracy properties, through\nsome numerical tests. Two new test cases are used to assess the transport of\nvector-valued fields on curved manifolds, solving the vector transport equation\nin isolation. The improvement of the schemes is also shown through two standard\ntest cases for rotating shallow-water models.",

    "abstract": "The complexity-precision trade-off of an object detector is a critical\nproblem for resource constrained vision tasks. Previous works have emphasized\ndetectors implemented with efficient backbones. The impact on this trade-off of\nproposal processing by the detection head is investigated in this work. It is\nhypothesized that improved detection efficiency requires a paradigm shift,\ntowards the unequal processing of proposals, assigning more computation to good\nproposals than poor ones. This results in better utilization of available\ncomputational budget, enabling higher accuracy for the same FLOPS. We formulate\nthis as a learning problem where the goal is to assign operators to proposals,\nin the detection head, so that the total computational cost is constrained and\nthe precision is maximized. The key finding is that such matching can be\nlearned as a function that maps each proposal embedding into a one-hot code\nover operators. While this function induces a complex dynamic network routing\nmechanism, it can be implemented by a simple MLP and learned end-to-end with\noff-the-shelf object detectors. This 'dynamic proposal processing' (DPP) is\nshown to outperform state-of-the-art end-to-end object detectors (DETR, Sparse\nR-CNN) by a clear margin for a given computational complexity.",

Using a global dynamics model\nenables the generation of aerobatics trajectories that exploit the entire\nflight envelope, enabling agile maneuvering through the stall regime, sideways\nuncoordinated flight, inverted flight etc. The method uses the differential\nflatness property of the global tailsitter flying wing dynamics, which is\nderived in this work. By performing snap minimization in the differentially\nflat output space, a computationally efficient algorithm, suitable for online\nmotion planning, is obtained. The algorithm is demonstrated in extensive flight\nexperiments encompassing six aerobatics maneuvers, a time-optimal drone racing\ntrajectory, and an airshow-like aerobatic sequence for three tailsitter\naircraft.",

    "abstract": "Ride-hailing and ride-sharing applications have recently gained popularity as\na convenient alternative to traditional modes of travel. Current research into\nautonomous vehicles is accelerating rapidly and will soon become a critical\ncomponent of a ride-hailing platforms architecture. Implementing an autonomous\nvehicle ride-hailing platform proves a difficult challenge due to the\ncentralized nature of traditional ride-hailing architectures. In a traditional\nride-hailing environment the drivers operate their own personal vehicles so it\nfollows that a fleet of autonomous vehicles would be required for a centralized\nride-hailing platform to succeed. Decentralization of the ride-hailing platform\nwould remove a roadblock along the way to an autonomous vehicle ride-hailing\nplatform by allowing owners of autonomous vehicles to add their vehicles to a\ncommunity-driven fleet when not in use. Blockchain technology is an attractive\nchoice for this decentralized architecture due to its immutability and fault\ntolerance. This thesis proposes a framework for developing a decentralized\nride-hailing architecture that is verifiably secure. This framework is\nimplemented on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform.

Additional scenarios can be implemented through a simple\nand modular interface. We demonstrate how vectorization enables parallel\nsimulation on accelerated hardware without added complexity. When comparing\nVMAS to OpenAI MPE, we show how MPE's execution time increases linearly in the\nnumber of simulations while VMAS is able to execute 30,000 parallel simulations\nin under 10s, proving more than 100x faster.

    "abstract": "An applied problem facing all areas of data science is harmonizing data\nsources. Joining data from multiple origins with unmapped and only partially\noverlapping features is a prerequisite to developing and testing robust,\ngeneralizable algorithms, especially in health care. We approach this issue in\nthe common but difficult case of numeric features such as nearly Gaussian and\nbinary features, where unit changes and variable shift make simple matching of\nunivariate summaries unsuccessful. We develop two novel procedures to address\nthis problem. First, we demonstrate multiple methods of \"fingerprinting\" a\nfeature based on its associations to other features. In the setting of even\nmodest prior information, this allows most shared features to be accurately\nidentified. Second, we demonstrate a deep learning algorithm for translation\nbetween databases. Unlike prior approaches, our algorithm takes advantage of\ndiscovered mappings while identifying surrogates for unshared features and\nlearning transformations. In synthetic and real-world experiments using two\nelectronic health record databases, our algorithms outperform existing\nbaselines for matching variable sets, while jointly learning to impute unshared\nor transformed variables.",

Our\nmethod is motivated by the observation that the specular highlight of an image\nis sparsely distributed while the remaining diffuse reflection can be well\napproximated by a linear combination of several distinct colors using a\nlow-rank and sparse decomposition framework. Unlike current solutions, our\ntensor low-rank decomposition keeps the spatial structure of specular and\ndiffuse information which enables us to recover the diffuse image under strong\nspecular reflection or in saturated regions. We further define and impose a new\npolarization regularization term as constraint on color channels. This\nregularization boosts the performance of the method to recover an accurate\ndiffuse image by handling the color distortion, a common problem of\nchromaticity-based methods, especially in case of strong specular reflection.\nThrough comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real polarization\nimages, we demonstrate that our method is able to significantly improve the\naccuracy of highlight specular removal, and outperform the competitive methods\nto recover the diffuse image, especially in regions of strong specular\nreflection or in saturated areas.",

A somewhat bewildering\nvariety of techniques have been used, not always with a clear understanding of\nthe reasons for their benefits, especially when used in combination. Here we\ntreat the embeddings of images as point particles and consider model\noptimization as a dynamic process on this system of particles. Our dynamic\nmodel combines an attractive force for similar images, a locally dispersive\nforce to avoid local collapse, and a global dispersive force to achieve a\nglobally-homogeneous distribution of particles. The dynamic perspective\nhighlights the advantage of using a delayed-parameter image embedding (a la\nBYOL) together with multiple views of the same image. It also uses a\npurely-dynamic local dispersive force (Brownian motion) that shows improved\nperformance over other methods and does not require knowledge of other particle\ncoordinates. The method is called MSBReg which stands for (i) a Multiview\ncentroid loss, which applies an attractive force to pull different image view\nembeddings toward their centroid, (ii) a Singular value loss, which pushes the\nparticle system toward spatially homogeneous density, (iii) a Brownian\ndiffusive loss. We evaluate downstream classification performance of MSBReg on\nImageNet as well as transfer learning tasks including fine-grained\nclassification, multi-class object classification, object detection, and\ninstance segmentation. In addition, we also show that applying our\nregularization term to other methods further improves their performance and\nstabilize the training by preventing a mode collapse.",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel flow synthesis based visual servoing framework enabling\nlong-range obstacle avoidance for Micro Air Vehicles (MAV) flying amongst tall\nskyscrapers. Recent deep learning based frameworks use optical flow to do\nhigh-precision visual servoing. In this paper, we explore the question: can we\ndesign a surrogate flow for these high-precision visual-servoing methods, which\nleads to obstacle avoidance? We revisit the concept of saliency for identifying\nhigh-rise structures in/close to the line of attack amongst other competing\nskyscrapers and buildings as a collision obstacle. A synthesised flow is used\nto displace the salient object segmentation mask. This flow is so computed that\nthe visual servoing controller maneuvers the MAV safely around the obstacle. In\nthis approach, we use a multi-step Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) based servo\ncontrol to achieve flow convergence, resulting in obstacle avoidance. We use\nthis novel pipeline to successfully and persistently maneuver high-rises and\nreach the goal in simulated and photo-realistic real-world scenes. We conduct\nextensive experimentation and compare our approach with optical flow and\nshort-range depth-based obstacle avoidance methods to demonstrate the proposed\nframework's merit.

It is promising\nin challenging scenes such as nighttime and complex backgrounds due to the\ninsensitivity to lighting conditions of thermal images. Thus, the key problem\nof RGB-T SOD is to make the features from the two modalities complement and\nadjust each other flexibly, since it is inevitable that any modalities of RGB-T\nimage pairs failure due to challenging scenes such as extreme light conditions\nand thermal crossover. In this paper, we propose a novel mirror complementary\nTransformer network (MCNet) for RGB-T SOD. Specifically, we introduce a\nTransformer-based feature extraction module to effective extract hierarchical\nfeatures of RGB and thermal images. Then, through the attention-based feature\ninteraction and serial multiscale dilated convolution (SDC) based feature\nfusion modules, the proposed model achieves the complementary interaction of\nlow-level features and the semantic fusion of deep features. Finally, based on\nthe mirror complementary structure, the salient regions of the two modalities\ncan be accurately extracted even one modality is invalid. To demonstrate the\nrobustness of the proposed model under challenging scenes in real world, we\nbuild a novel RGB-T SOD dataset VT723 based on a large public semantic\nsegmentation RGB-T dataset used in the autonomous driving domain.

    "abstract": "The imminent advent of large-scale green hydrogen (H2) production raises the\ncentral question of which of the two options, transporting \"green\" molecules,\nor transporting \"green\" electrons, is the most cost-effective one. This paper\nproposes a first-of-its-kind mathematical framework for the optimal integrated\nplanning of electricity and H2 infrastructure for transporting large-scale\nvariable renewable energy (VRE). In contrast to most existing works, this work\nincorporates essential nonlinearities such as voltage drops due to losses in\nhigh-voltage alternating current (HVAC) and high-voltage direct current (HVDC)\ntransmission lines, losses in HVDC converter stations, reactive power flow,\npressure drops in pipelines, and linepack, all of which play an important role\nin determining the optimal infrastructure investment decision. Capturing these\nnonlinearities requires casting the problem as a nonconvex mixed-integer\nnonlinear program (MINLP), whose complexity is further exacerbated by its large\nsize due to the relatively high temporal resolution of RES forecasts. This work\nthen leverages recent advancements in convex relaxations to instead solve a\ntractable alternative in the form of a mixed-integer quadratically constrained\nprogramming (MIQCP) problem. The impact of other fundamental factors such as\ntransmission distance and RES capacity is also thoroughly analysed on a\ncanonical two-node system.

While many\ncountermeasures may look promising, only a few withstand rigorous evaluation.\nDefenses using random transformations (RT) have shown impressive results,\nparticularly BaRT (Raff et al., 2019) on ImageNet. However, this type of\ndefense has not been rigorously evaluated, leaving its robustness properties\npoorly understood. Their stochastic properties make evaluation more challenging\nand render many proposed attacks on deterministic models inapplicable. First,\nwe show that the BPDA attack (Athalye et al., 2018a) used in BaRT's evaluation\nis ineffective and likely overestimates its robustness. We then attempt to\nconstruct the strongest possible RT defense through the informed selection of\ntransformations and Bayesian optimization for tuning their parameters.\nFurthermore, we create the strongest possible attack to evaluate our RT\ndefense. Our new attack vastly outperforms the baseline, reducing the accuracy\nby 83% compared to the 19% reduction by the commonly used EoT attack\n($4.3\\times$ improvement). Our result indicates that the RT defense on the\nImagenette dataset (a ten-class subset of ImageNet) is not robust against\nadversarial examples.

In recent years,\nmobility digital twin that makes a virtual replication of human mobility and\npredicting or simulating the fine-grained movements of the subjects in a\nvirtual space at a metropolitan scale in near real-time has shown its great\npotential in modern urban intelligent systems. However, few studies have\nprovided practical solutions. The main difficulties are four-folds. 1) The\ndaily variation of human mobility is hard to model and predict; 2) the\ntransportation network enforces a complex constraints on human mobility; 3)\ngenerating a rational fine-grained human trajectory is challenging for existing\nmachine learning models; and 4) making a fine-grained prediction incurs high\ncomputational costs, which is challenging for an online system. Bearing these\ndifficulties in mind, in this paper we propose a two-stage human mobility\npredictor that stratifies the coarse and fine-grained level predictions. In the\nfirst stage, to encode the daily variation of human mobility at a metropolitan\nlevel, we automatically extract citywide mobility trends as crowd contexts and\npredict long-term and long-distance movements at a coarse level. In the second\nstage, the coarse predictions are resolved to a fine-grained level via a\nprobabilistic trajectory retrieval method, which offloads most of the heavy\ncomputations to the offline phase. We tested our method using a real-world\nmobile phone GPS dataset in the Kanto area in Japan, and achieved good\nprediction accuracy and a time efficiency of about 2 min in predicting future\n1h movements of about 220K mobile phone users on a single machine to support\nmore higher-level analysis of mobility prediction.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we leverage low-level compiler intermediate representations\n(IR) to improve code translation. Traditional transpilers rely on syntactic\ninformation and handcrafted rules, which limits their applicability and\nproduces unnatural-looking code. Applying neural machine translation (NMT)\napproaches to code has successfully broadened the set of programs on which one\ncan get a natural-looking translation. However, they treat the code as\nsequences of text tokens, and still do not differentiate well enough between\nsimilar pieces of code which have different semantics in different languages.\nThe consequence is low quality translation, reducing the practicality of NMT,\nand stressing the need for an approach significantly increasing its accuracy.\nHere we propose to augment code translation with IRs, specifically LLVM IR,\nwith results on the C++, Java, Rust, and Go languages. Our method improves upon\nthe state of the art for unsupervised code translation, increasing the number\nof correct translations by 11% on average, and up to 79% for the Java - Rust\npair. We extend previous test sets for code translation, by adding hundreds of\nGo and Rust functions. Additionally, we train models with high performance on\nthe problem of IR decompilation, generating programming source code from IR,\nand study using IRs as intermediary pivot for translation.",

    "abstract": "5G network operators consider the dense deployment of small base-stations\n(SBSs) to increase network coverage and capacity. Hence, operators face the\nchallenge of X-hauling, i.e., backhauling or fronthauling, their traffic to the\ncore network. Also, SBSs densification will increase the possibility of failure\nof these X-haul links. To cope with this problem, an X-haul outage compensation\nscheme with the assistance of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) is\nproposed to mitigate or at least alleviate the effect of X-haul failure. The\nRIS is a newly adopted technology that is able to improve the performance of\nwireless networks. In this paper, we present and evaluate an X-haul outage\ncompensation scheme based on placing a number of RIS panels in pre-planned\nlocations to mitigate the effect of X-haul failure. This evaluation is done\nusing frequencies below and beyond 6 GHz. Based on our analytical results, the\nproposed RIS scheme shows that placing a sufficient number of RIS elements in\nproximity to the failed SBS under certain conditions can help acquire the same\nX-haul rate before the occurrence of the failure. Also, we show that for high\nX-haul spectral density, the RIS-assisted transmission with a certain number of\nelements can be more energy-efficient than line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight\ntransmissions. Finally, the system's energy efficiency is addressed with and\nwithout RIS, and the optimal number of RIS reflecting elements is derived.",

However, exhaustively\ncollecting and labeling the data necessary to fully test the long tail of rare\nand challenging scenarios is difficult and expensive. In this work, we\nconstruct a new benchmark for evaluating and improving model robustness by\napplying perturbations to existing data. Specifically, we conduct an extensive\nlabeling effort to identify causal agents, or agents whose presence influences\nhuman driver behavior in any way, in the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), and\nwe use these labels to perturb the data by deleting non-causal agents from the\nscene.

Under non-causal perturbations, we observe a\n$25$-$38\\%$ relative change in minADE as compared to the original. We then\ninvestigate techniques to improve model robustness, including increasing the\ntraining dataset size and using targeted data augmentations that drop agents\nthroughout training.

Specifically, we consider the\nproblem of efficiently learning such policies for agents with limited\ncomputational and communication capacity, constraints that are frequently\nencountered in edge devices.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of autonomous channel access (AutoCA), where a group\nof terminals tries to discover a communication strategy with an access point\n(AP) via a common wireless channel in a distributed fashion. Due to the\nirregular topology and the limited communication range of terminals, a\npractical challenge for AutoCA is the hidden terminal problem, which is\nnotorious in wireless networks for deteriorating the throughput and delay\nperformances. To meet the challenge, this paper presents a new multi-agent deep\nreinforcement learning paradigm, dubbed MADRL-HT, tailored for AutoCA in the\npresence of hidden terminals. MADRL-HT exploits topological insights and\ntransforms the observation space of each terminal into a scalable form\nindependent of the number of terminals. To compensate for the partial\nobservability, we put forth a look-back mechanism such that the terminals can\ninfer behaviors of their hidden terminals from the carrier sensed channel\nstates as well as feedback from the AP. A window-based global reward function\nis proposed, whereby the terminals are instructed to maximize the system\nthroughput while balancing the terminals' transmission opportunities over the\ncourse of learning. Extensive numerical experiments verified the superior\nperformance of our solution benchmarked against the legacy carrier-sense\nmultiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol.",

An (interactive) assessment system on the shop floor can\noptimize the process and reduce stopovers because it can provide constant\nvaluable information regarding the machine condition to the operators. However,\nformalizing operational (tacit) knowledge to explicit knowledge is not an easy\ntask. This transformation considers modeling expert knowledge, quantification\nof knowledge uncertainty, and validation of the acquired knowledge. This study\nproposes a novel approach for production assessment using a knowledge transfer\nframework and evidence theory to address the aforementioned challenges. The\nmain contribution of this paper is a methodology for the formalization of tacit\nknowledge based on an extended failure mode and effect analysis for knowledge\nextraction, as well as the use of evidence theory for the uncertainty\ndefinition of knowledge. Moreover, this approach uses primitive recursive\nfunctions for knowledge modeling and proposes a validation strategy of the\nknowledge using machine data.

    "abstract": "Visual stories are an effective and powerful tool to convey specific\ninformation to a diverse public. Scrollytelling is a recent visual storytelling\ntechnique extensively used on the web, where content appears or changes as\nusers scroll up or down a page. By employing the familiar gesture of scrolling\nas its primary interaction mechanism, it provides users with a sense of\ncontrol, exploration and discoverability while still offering a simple and\nintuitive interface. In this paper, we present a novel approach for authoring,\nediting, and presenting data-driven scientific narratives using scrollytelling.\nOur method flexibly integrates common sources such as images, text, and video,\nbut also supports more specialized visualization techniques such as interactive\nmaps as well as scalar field and mesh data visualizations. We show that\nscrolling navigation can be used to traverse dynamic narratives and demonstrate\nhow it can be combined with interactive parameter exploration. The resulting\nsystem consists of an extensible web-based authoring tool capable of exporting\nstand-alone stories that can be hosted on any web server. We demonstrate the\npower and utility of our approach with case studies from several of diverse\nscientific fields and with a user study including 12 participants of diverse\nprofessional backgrounds.

    "abstract": "Transformers have quickly shined in the computer vision world since the\nemergence of Vision Transformers (ViTs). The dominant role of convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) seems to be challenged by increasingly effective\ntransformer-based models. Very recently, a couple of advanced convolutional\nmodels strike back with large kernels motivated by the local but large\nattention mechanism, showing appealing performance and efficiency. While one of\nthem, i.e. RepLKNet, impressively manages to scale the kernel size to 31x31\nwith improved performance, the performance starts to saturate as the kernel\nsize continues growing, compared to the scaling trend of advanced ViTs such as\nSwin Transformer. In this paper, we explore the possibility of training extreme\nconvolutions larger than 31x31 and test whether the performance gap can be\neliminated by strategically enlarging convolutions. This study ends up with a\nrecipe for applying extremely large kernels from the perspective of sparsity,\nwhich can smoothly scale up kernels to 61x61 with better performance. Built on\nthis recipe, we propose Sparse Large Kernel Network (SLaK), a pure CNN\narchitecture equipped with 51x51 kernels that can perform on par with or better\nthan state-of-the-art hierarchical Transformers and modern ConvNet\narchitectures like ConvNeXt and RepLKNet, on ImageNet classification as well as\ntypical downstream tasks.

The assumption that the IRS is located at a fixed position\nwill prohibit mobile users from maximizing many wireless network benefits, such\nas data rate and coverage. Furthermore, assuming that the IRS is placed on a\nUAV is impractical for various reasons, including the IRS's weight and size and\nthe speed of wind in severe weather. Unlike previous studies, this study\nassumes a single UAV and an IRS mounted on a mobile ground vehicle (M-IRS) to\nbe deployed in an Internet-of-Things (IoT) 6G wireless network to maximize the\naverage data rate. Such a methodology for providing wireless coverage using an\nM-IRS assisted UAV system is expected in smart cities. In this paper, we\nformulate an optimization problem to find an efficient trajectory for the UAV,\nan efficient path for the M-IRS, and users' power allocation coefficients that\nmaximize the average data rate for mobile ground users. Due to its\nintractability, we propose efficient techniques that can help in finding the\nsolution to the optimization problem. First, we show that our dynamic power\nallocation technique outperforms the fixed power allocation technique in terms\nof network average sum rate. Then we employ the individual movement model\n(Random Waypoint Model) in order to represent the users' movements inside the\ncoverage area. Finally, we propose an efficient approach using a Genetic\nAlgorithm (GA) for finding an efficient trajectory for the UAV, and an\nefficient path for the M-IRS to provide wireless connectivity for mobile users\nduring their movement. We demonstrate through simulations that our methodology\ncan enhance the average data rate by 15\\% on average compared with the static\nIRS and by 25\\% on average compared without the IRS system.",

Prior research has\nmostly focused on auctions which are truthful (such as SPA) since uniform\nbidding is optimal in such auctions, which makes it manageable to reason about\nequilibria. A tantalizing question is whether one can obtain more efficient\noutcomes by leaving the realm of truthful auctions.\nThis is the first paper to study non-truthful auctions in the prior-free\nauto-bidding setting. Our first result is that non-truthfulness provides no\nbenefit when one considers deterministic auctions. Any deterministic mechanism\nhas a price of anarchy (PoA) of at least $2$, even for $2$ bidders; this\nmatches what can be achieved by deterministic truthful mechanisms. In\nparticular, we prove that the first price auction has PoA of exactly $2$. For\nour second result, we construct a randomized non-truthful auction that achieves\na PoA of $1.8$ for $2$ bidders. This is the best-known PoA for this problem.\nThe previously best-known PoA for this problem was $1.9$ and was achieved with\na truthful mechanism. Moreover, we demonstrate the benefit of non-truthfulness\nin this setting by showing that the truthful version of this randomized auction\nalso has a PoA of $1.9$.

Currently, pruning is still highly\ndependent on human labor. The workers' experience will strongly affect the\nrobustness of the performance of the tree pruning. Thus, it is a challenge for\nworkers and farmers to evaluate the pruning performance. Intended for a better\nsolution to the problem, this paper presents a novel pruning classification\nstrategy model called \"OTSU-SVM\" to evaluate the pruning performance based on\nthe shadows of branches and leaves. This model considers not only the available\nilluminated area of the tree but also the uniformity of the illuminated area of\nthe tree.

In\naddition, the data from the pear trees in the Yuhang District, Hangzhou is also\nused in the experiment. In this experiment, we prove that the OTSU-SVM has good\naccuracy with 80% and high performance in the evaluation of the pruning for the\npear trees.

In recent years,\nclass activation mapping-based method has been widely used to interpret the\ninternal decisions of models in computer vision tasks. However, when this\nmethod uses backpropagation to obtain gradients, it will cause noise in the\nsaliency map, and even locate features that are irrelevant to decisions. In\nthis paper, we propose an Absolute value Class Activation Mapping-based\n(Abs-CAM) method, which optimizes the gradients derived from the\nbackpropagation and turns all of them into positive gradients to enhance the\nvisual features of output neurons' activation, and improve the localization\nability of the saliency map. The framework of Abs-CAM is divided into two\nphases: generating initial saliency map and generating final saliency map. The\nfirst phase improves the localization ability of the saliency map by optimizing\nthe gradient, and the second phase linearly combines the initial saliency map\nwith the original image to enhance the semantic information of the saliency\nmap. We conduct qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the proposed method,\nincluding Deletion, Insertion, and Pointing Game.

However, existing self-paced learning methods are\nlimited to pointwise learning, while AUC maximization is a pairwise learning\nproblem. To solve this challenging problem, we innovatively propose a balanced\nself-paced AUC maximization algorithm (BSPAUC). Specifically, we first provide\na statistical objective for self-paced AUC. Based on this, we propose our\nself-paced AUC maximization formulation, where a novel balanced self-paced\nregularization term is embedded to ensure that the selected positive and\nnegative samples have proper proportions. Specially, the sub-problem with\nrespect to all weight variables may be non-convex in our formulation, while the\none is normally convex in existing self-paced problems. To address this, we\npropose a doubly cyclic block coordinate descent method. More importantly, we\nprove that the sub-problem with respect to all weight variables converges to a\nstationary point on the basis of closed-form solutions, and our BSPAUC\nconverges to a stationary point of our fixed optimization objective under a\nmild assumption.

Given this video abstraction, COST maintains and\ntracks object-associated dialog states, which are updated upon receiving new\nquestions.

Our approach is able to synthesize a controller\nfor nonlinear dynamics and polynomial predicate functions.

    "abstract": "Planning under social interactions with other agents is an essential problem\nfor autonomous driving. As the actions of the autonomous vehicle in the\ninteractions affect and are also affected by other agents, autonomous vehicles\nneed to efficiently infer the reaction of the other agents. Most existing\napproaches formulate the problem as a generalized Nash equilibrium problem\nsolved by optimization-based methods. However, they demand too much\ncomputational resource and easily fall into the local minimum due to the\nnon-convexity. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) successfully tackles such issues\nin game-theoretic problems. However, as the interaction game tree grows\nexponentially, the general MCTS still requires a huge amount of iterations to\nreach the optima. In this paper, we introduce an efficient game-theoretic\ntrajectory planning algorithm based on general MCTS by incorporating a\nprediction algorithm as a heuristic. On top of it, a social-compliant reward\nand a Bayesian inference algorithm are designed to generate diverse driving\nbehaviors and identify the other driver's driving preference.

    "abstract": "Neural architecture search (NAS) has demonstrated amazing success in\nsearching for efficient deep neural networks (DNNs) from a given supernet. In\nparallel, the lottery ticket hypothesis has shown that DNNs contain small\nsubnetworks that can be trained from scratch to achieve a comparable or higher\naccuracy than original DNNs. As such, it is currently a common practice to\ndevelop efficient DNNs via a pipeline of first search and then prune.\nNevertheless, doing so often requires a search-train-prune-retrain process and\nthus prohibitive computational cost. In this paper, we discover for the first\ntime that both efficient DNNs and their lottery subnetworks (i.e., lottery\ntickets) can be directly identified from a supernet, which we term as\nSuperTickets, via a two-in-one training scheme with jointly architecture\nsearching and parameter pruning. Moreover, we develop a progressive and unified\nSuperTickets identification strategy that allows the connectivity of\nsubnetworks to change during supernet training, achieving better accuracy and\nefficiency trade-offs than conventional sparse training. Finally, we evaluate\nwhether such identified SuperTickets drawn from one task can transfer well to\nother tasks, validating their potential of handling multiple tasks\nsimultaneously. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on three tasks and\nfour benchmark datasets validate that our proposed SuperTickets achieve boosted\naccuracy and efficiency trade-offs than both typical NAS and pruning pipelines,\nregardless of having retraining or not.

An\nAgg-GNN is a hybrid architecture where information is defined on the nodes of a\ngraph, but it is processed block-wise by Euclidean CNNs on the nodes after\nseveral diffusions on the graph shift operator. We derive stability bounds for\nthe mapping operator associated to a generic Agg-GNN, and we specify conditions\nunder which such operators can be stable to deformations. We prove that the\nstability bounds are defined by the properties of the filters in the first\nlayer of the CNN that acts on each node. Additionally, we show that there is a\nclose relationship between the number of aggregations, the filter's\nselectivity, and the size of the stability constants. We also conclude that in\nAgg-GNNs the selectivity of the mapping operators is tied to the properties of\nthe filters only in the first layer of the CNN stage. This shows a substantial\ndifference with respect to the stability properties of selection GNNs, where\nthe selectivity of the filters in all layers is constrained by their stability.\nWe provide numerical evidence corroborating the results derived, testing the\nbehavior of Agg-GNNs in real life application scenarios considering\nperturbations of different magnitude.",

In\naddition, for intra-domain category regularization, we tailored a\nregularization technique for the source and target domains, respectively.

In the target domain, an augmented consistency category\nregularization loss is proposed to force the model to produce consistent\npredictions for augmented/unaugmented target images, which encourages\nsemantically similar regions to be given the same label.

    "title": "Mining Discriminative Food Regions for Accurate Food Recognition",
    "abstract": "Automatic food recognition is the very first step towards passive dietary\nmonitoring. In this paper, we address the problem of food recognition by mining\ndiscriminative food regions. Taking inspiration from Adversarial Erasing, a\nstrategy that progressively discovers discriminative object regions for weakly\nsupervised semantic segmentation, we propose a novel network architecture in\nwhich a primary network maintains the base accuracy of classifying an input\nimage, an auxiliary network adversarially mines discriminative food regions,\nand a region network classifies the resulting mined regions. The global (the\noriginal input image) and the local (the mined regions) representations are\nthen integrated for the final prediction. The proposed architecture denoted as\nPAR-Net is end-to-end trainable, and highlights discriminative regions in an\nonline fashion. In addition, we introduce a new fine-grained food dataset named\nas Sushi-50, which consists of 50 different sushi categories. Extensive\nexperiments have been conducted to evaluate the proposed approach. On three\nfood datasets chosen (Food-101, Vireo-172, and Sushi-50), our approach performs\nconsistently and achieves state-of-the-art results (top-1 testing accuracy of\n$90.4\\%$, $90.2\\%$, $92.0\\%$, respectively) compared with other existing\napproaches.

    "abstract": "Flexible task planning continues to pose a difficult challenge for robots,\nwhere a robot is unable to creatively adapt their task plans to new or unseen\nproblems, which is mainly due to the limited knowledge it has about its actions\nand world. Motivated by a human's ability to adapt, we explore how task plans\nfrom a knowledge graph, known as the Functional Object- Oriented Network\n(FOON), can be generated for novel problems requiring concepts that are not\nreadily available to the robot in its knowledge base. Knowledge from 140\ncooking recipes are structured in a FOON knowledge graph, which is used for\nacquiring task plan sequences known as task trees. Task trees can be modified\nto replicate recipes in a FOON knowledge graph format, which can be useful for\nenriching FOON with new recipes containing unknown object and state\ncombinations, by relying upon semantic similarity. We demonstrate the power of\ntask tree generation to create task trees with never-before-seen ingredient and\nstate combinations as seen in recipes from the Recipe1M+ dataset, with which we\nevaluate the quality of the trees based on how accurately they depict newly\nadded ingredients.

    "abstract": "We present a novel approach to improve the performance of deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL) based outdoor robot navigation systems. Most, existing DRL\nmethods are based on carefully designed dense reward functions that learn the\nefficient behavior in an environment. We circumvent this issue by working only\nwith sparse rewards (which are easy to design), and propose a novel adaptive\nHeavy-Tailed Reinforce algorithm for Outdoor Navigation called HTRON. Our main\nidea is to utilize heavy-tailed policy parametrizations which implicitly induce\nexploration in sparse reward settings. We evaluate the performance of HTRON\nagainst Reinforce, PPO and TRPO algorithms in three different outdoor\nscenarios: goal-reaching, obstacle avoidance, and uneven terrain navigation. We\nobserve in average an increase of 34.41% in terms of success rate, a 15.15%\ndecrease in the average time steps taken to reach the goal, and a 24.9%\ndecrease in the elevation cost compared to the navigation policies obtained by\nthe other methods. Further, we demonstrate that our algorithm can be\ntransferred directly into a Clearpath Husky robot to perform outdoor terrain\nnavigation in real-world scenarios.",

    "abstract": "To accomplish task efficiently in a multiple robots system, a problem that\nhas to be addressed is Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). LiDAR\n(Light Detection and Ranging) has been used for many SLAM solutions due to its\nsuperb accuracy, but its performance degrades in featureless environments, like\ntunnels or long corridors. Centralized SLAM solves the problem with a cloud\nserver, which requires a huge amount of computational resources and lacks\nrobustness against central node failure. To address these issues, we present a\ndistributed SLAM solution to estimate the trajectory of a group of robots using\nUltra-WideBand (UWB) ranging and odometry measurements. The proposed approach\ndistributes the processing among the robot team and significantly mitigates the\ncomputation concern emerged from the centralized SLAM. Our solution determines\nthe relative pose (also known as loop closure) between two robots by minimizing\nthe UWB ranging measurements taken at different positions when the robots are\nin close proximity. UWB provides a good distance measure in line-of-sight\nconditions, but retrieving a precise pose estimation remains a challenge, due\nto ranging noise and unpredictable path traveled by the robot. To deal with the\nsuspicious loop closures, we use Pairwise Consistency Maximization (PCM) to\nexamine the quality of loop closures and perform outlier rejections. The\nfiltered loop closures are then fused with odometry in a distributed pose graph\noptimization (DPGO) module to recover the full trajectory of the robot team.\nExtensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the\nproposed approach.",

For\nmost camera-LIDAR fusion algorithms, however, the calibration of the sensor\nsuite will greatly impact the performance. More specifically, the detection\nalgorithm usually requires an accurate geometric relationship among multiple\nsensors as the input, and it is often assumed that the contents from these\nsensors are captured at the same time. Preparing such sensor suites involves\ncarefully designed calibration rigs and accurate synchronization mechanisms,\nand the preparation process is usually done offline. In this work, a\nsegmentation-based framework is proposed to jointly estimate the geometrical\nand temporal parameters in the calibration of a camera-LIDAR suite. A semantic\nsegmentation mask is first applied to both sensor modalities, and the\ncalibration parameters are optimized through pixel-wise bidirectional loss. We\nspecifically incorporated the velocity information from optical flow for\ntemporal parameters. Since supervision is only performed at the segmentation\nlevel, no calibration label is needed within the framework. The proposed\nalgorithm is tested on the KITTI dataset, and the result shows an accurate\nreal-time calibration of both geometric and temporal parameters.",

To address this real-world challenge, in\nthis work, we study the motion transfer system, which can transfer the user\nphoto to the sign language video of specific words. In particular, the\nappearance content of the output video comes from the provided user image,\nwhile the motion of the video is extracted from the specified tutorial video.\nWe observe two primary limitations in adopting the state-of-the-art motion\ntransfer methods to sign language generation:(1) Existing motion transfer works\nignore the prior geometrical knowledge of the human body.

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of in-the-wild videos taken by non-specialists, blind\nvideo quality assessment (VQA) has become a challenging and demanding problem.\nAlthough lots of efforts have been made to solve this problem, it remains\nunclear how the human visual system (HVS) relates to the temporal quality of\nvideos. Meanwhile, recent work has found that the frames of natural video\ntransformed into the perceptual domain of the HVS tend to form a straight\ntrajectory of the representations. With the obtained insight that distortion\nimpairs the perceived video quality and results in a curved trajectory of the\nperceptual representation, we propose a temporal perceptual quality index\n(TPQI) to measure the temporal distortion by describing the graphic morphology\nof the representation. Specifically, we first extract the video perceptual\nrepresentations from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and primary visual\narea (V1) of the HVS, and then measure the straightness and compactness of\ntheir trajectories to quantify the degradation in naturalness and content\ncontinuity of video. Experiments show that the perceptual representation in the\nHVS is an effective way of predicting subjective temporal quality, and thus\nTPQI can, for the first time, achieve comparable performance to the spatial\nquality metric and be even more effective in assessing videos with large\ntemporal variations. We further demonstrate that by combining with NIQE, a\nspatial quality metric, TPQI can achieve top performance over popular\nin-the-wild video datasets. More importantly, TPQI does not require any\nadditional information beyond the video being evaluated and thus can be applied\nto any datasets without parameter tuning.

    "abstract": "In the practical application of the Bridge Weigh-In-Motion (BWIM) methods,\nthe position of the wheels or axles during the passage of a vehicle is in most\ncases a prerequisite. To avoid the use of conventional axle detectors and\nbridge type specific methods, we propose a novel method for axle detection\nthrough the placement of accelerometers at any point of a bridge. In order to\ndevelop a model that is as simple and comprehensible as possible, the axle\ndetection task is implemented as a binary classification problem instead of a\nregression problem. The model is implemented as a Fully Convolutional Network\nto process signals in the form of Continuous Wavelet Transforms. This allows\npassages of any length to be processed in a single step with maximum efficiency\nwhile utilising multiple scales in a single evaluation. This enables our method\nto use acceleration signals at any location of the bridge structure serving as\nVirtual Axle Detectors (VADs) without being limited to specific structural\ntypes of bridges. To test the proposed method, we analysed 3787 train passages\nrecorded on a steel trough railway bridge of a long-distance traffic line. Our\nresults on the measurement data show that our model detects 95% of the axes,\nthus, 128,599 of 134,800 previously unseen axles were correctly detected. In\ntotal, 90% of the axles can be detected with a maximum spatial error of 20cm,\nwith a maximum velocity of $v_{\\mathrm{max}}=56,3~\\mathrm{m/s}$. The analysis\nshows that our developed model can use accelerometers as VADs even under real\noperating conditions.",

In this paper, leveraging on the power of\ndeep learning, we propose a low-complexity precoding design framework for\nMU-MIMO systems.

A customized deep neural network is\ndesigned to fit the mapping from the channels to the precoding matrix.

    "abstract": "Existing face forgery detection methods usually treat face forgery detection\nas a binary classification problem and adopt deep convolution neural networks\nto learn discriminative features. The ideal discriminative features should be\nonly related to the real/fake labels of facial images. However, we observe that\nthe features learned by vanilla classification networks are correlated to\nunnecessary properties, such as forgery methods and facial identities. Such\nphenomenon would limit forgery detection performance especially for the\ngeneralization ability. Motivated by this, we propose a novel method which\nutilizes adversarial learning to eliminate the negative effect of different\nforgery methods and facial identities, which helps classification network to\nlearn intrinsic common discriminative features for face forgery detection. To\nleverage data lacking ground truth label of facial identities, we design a\nspecial identity discriminator based on similarity information derived from\noff-the-shelf face recognition model. With the help of adversarial learning,\nour face forgery detection model learns to extract common discriminative\nfeatures through eliminating the effect of forgery methods and facial\nidentities.

However, this disregards the embedding norm,\nwhich can carry additional beneficial context such as class- or image-intrinsic\nuncertainty. In addition, proxy-based DML struggles to learn class-internal\nstructures. To address both issues at once, we introduce non-isotropic\nprobabilistic proxy-based DML. We model images as directional von Mises-Fisher\n(vMF) distributions on the hypersphere that can reflect image-intrinsic\nuncertainties. Further, we derive non-isotropic von Mises-Fisher (nivMF)\ndistributions for class proxies to better represent complex class-specific\nvariances. To measure the proxy-to-image distance between these models, we\ndevelop and investigate multiple distribution-to-point and\ndistribution-to-distribution metrics. Each framework choice is motivated by a\nset of ablational studies, which showcase beneficial properties of our\nprobabilistic approach to proxy-based DML, such as uncertainty-awareness,\nbetter-behaved gradients during training, and overall improved generalization\nperformance. The latter is especially reflected in the competitive performance\non the standard DML benchmarks, where our approach compares favorably,\nsuggesting that existing proxy-based DML can significantly benefit from a more\nprobabilistic treatment.

Experiments show that COMBO can improve performances over\nstate-of-the-art supervised networks, e.g. RAFT, reaching state-of-the-art\nresults on several benchmarks. We highlight how COMBO can leverage the BC model\nand adapt to its limitations. Finally, we show that our semi-supervised method\ncan significantly simplify the training procedure.",

    "abstract": "Many real-world networks, like the Internet, are not the result of central\ndesign but instead the outcome of the interaction of local agents who are\nselfishly optimizing for their individual utility. The famous Network Creation\nGame [Fabrikant et al., PODC 2003] enables us to understand such processes,\ntheir dynamics, and their outcomes in the form of equilibrium states. In this\nmodel, agents buy incident edges towards other agents for a price of~\\(\\alpha\\)\nand simultaneously try to minimize their buying cost and their total hop\ndistance. Since in many real-world networks, e.g., social networks, consent\nfrom both sides is required to maintain a connection, Corbo and Parkes [PODC\n2005] proposed a bilateral version of the Network Creation Game, in which\nmutual consent and payment are required in order to create edges. It is known\nthat the bilateral version has a significantly higher Price of Anarchy,\ncompared to the unilateral version. This is counter-intuitive, since\ncooperation should help to avoid socially bad states. We investigate this\nphenomenon by analyzing the Price of Anarchy of the bilateral version with\nrespect to different solution concepts that allow for various degrees of\ncooperation among the agents. With this, we provide insights into what kind of\ncooperation is needed to ensure that socially good networks are created. We\npresent a collection of asymptotically tight bounds on the Price of Anarchy\nthat precisely map the impact of cooperation on the quality of tree networks\nand we find that weak forms of cooperation already yield a significantly\nimproved Price of Anarchy. Moreover, for general networks we show that enhanced\ncooperation yields close to optimal networks for a wide range of edge prices.",

Current works mainly use sequence-to-sequence models to solve this\nproblem, either in an autoregressive architecture or a flow-based\nnon-autoregressive architecture. However, these models suffer from several\ndrawbacks: 1) Instead of directly generating audios, they use a two-stage\npipeline that first generates mel-spectrograms and then reconstructs audios\nfrom the spectrograms. This causes cumbersome deployment and degradation of\nspeech quality due to error propagation; 2) The audio reconstruction algorithm\nused by these models limits the inference speed and audio quality, while neural\nvocoders are not available for these models since their output spectrograms are\nnot accurate enough; 3) The autoregressive model suffers from high inference\nlatency, while the flow-based model has high memory occupancy: neither of them\nis efficient enough in both time and memory usage. To tackle these problems, we\npropose FastLTS, a non-autoregressive end-to-end model which can directly\nsynthesize high-quality speech audios from unconstrained talking videos with\nlow latency, and has a relatively small model size. Besides, different from the\nwidely used 3D-CNN visual frontend for lip movement encoding, we for the first\ntime propose a transformer-based visual frontend for this task.

    "abstract": "We propose and analyze a product segmentation newsvendor problem, which\ngeneralizes the phenomenon of segmentation sales of a class of perishable\nitems. The product segmentation newsvendor problem is a new variant of the\nnewsvendor problem, reflecting that sellers maximize profits by determining the\ninventory of the whole item in the context of uncertain demand for sub-items.\nWe derive the closed-form robust ordering decision by assuming that the means\nand covariance matrix of stochastic demand are available but not the\ndistributions. However, robust approaches that always trade-off in the\nworst-case demand scenario face a concern in solution conservatism; thus, the\ntraditional robust schemes offer unsatisfactory. In this paper, we integrate\nrobust and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques and propose a new\nparadigm termed robust learning to increase the attractiveness of robust\npolicies. Notably, we take the robust decision as human domain knowledge and\nimplement it into the training process of DRL by designing a full-process\nhuman-machine collaborative mechanism of teaching experience, normative\ndecision, and regularization return. Simulation results confirm that our\napproach effectively improves robust performance and can generalize to various\nproblems that require robust but less conservative solutions. Simultaneously,\nfewer training episodes, increased training stability, and interpretability of\nbehavior may have the opportunity to facilitate the deployment of DRL\nalgorithms in operational practice. Furthermore, the successful attempt of\nRLDQN to solve the 1000-dimensional demand scenarios reveals that the algorithm\nprovides a path to solve complex operational problems through human-machine\ncollaboration and may have potential significance for solving other complex\noperational management problems.",

Models are typically pretrained on large ``upstream''\ndatasets for classification, as such labels are easy to collect, and then\nfinetuned on ``downstream'' tasks such as action localisation, which are\nsmaller due to their finer-grained annotations. In this paper, we question this\napproach, and propose co-finetuning -- simultaneously training a single model\non multiple ``upstream'' and ``downstream'' tasks. We demonstrate that\nco-finetuning outperforms traditional transfer learning when using the same\ntotal amount of data, and also show how we can easily extend our approach to\nmultiple ``upstream'' datasets to further improve performance. In particular,\nco-finetuning significantly improves the performance on rare classes in our\ndownstream task, as it has a regularising effect, and enables the network to\nlearn feature representations that transfer between different datasets.\nFinally, we observe how co-finetuning with public, video classification\ndatasets, we are able to achieve state-of-the-art results for spatio-temporal\naction localisation on the challenging AVA and AVA-Kinetics datasets,\noutperforming recent works which develop intricate models.",

    "abstract": "Dimensional reduction~(DR) maps high-dimensional data into a lower dimensions\nlatent space with minimized defined optimization objectives. The DR method\nusually falls into feature selection~(FS) and feature projection~(FP). FS\nfocuses on selecting a critical subset of dimensions but risks destroying the\ndata distribution (structure). On the other hand, FP combines all the input\nfeatures into lower dimensions space, aiming to maintain the data structure;\nbut lacks interpretability and sparsity. FS and FP are traditionally\nincompatible categories; thus, they have not been unified into an amicable\nframework. We propose that the ideal DR approach combines both FS and FP into a\nunified end-to-end manifold learning framework, simultaneously performing\nfundamental feature discovery while maintaining the intrinsic relationships\nbetween data samples in the latent space. In this work, we develop a unified\nframework, Unified Dimensional Reduction Neural-network~(UDRN), that integrates\nFS and FP in a compatible, end-to-end way. We improve the neural network\nstructure by implementing FS and FP tasks separately using two stacked\nsub-networks. In addition, we designed data augmentation of the DR process to\nimprove the generalization ability of the method when dealing with extensive\nfeature datasets and designed loss functions that can cooperate with the data\naugmentation.

For patients who do not require mechanical support,\nvibrotactile feedback interfaces have proven to be a successful approach in\nrestoring balance. Most of the existing strategies assess trunk or head tilt\nand velocity or plantar forces, and are limited to the analysis of stance. On\nthe other hand, central to balance control is the need to maintain the body's\ncentre of pressure (CoP) within feasible limits of the support polygon (SP), as\nin standing, or on track to a new SP, as in walking. Hence, this paper proposes\nan exploratory study to investigate whether vibrotactile feedback can be\nemployed to lead human CoP during walking. The ErgoTac-Belt vibrotactile device\nis introduced to instruct the users about the direction to take, both in the\nantero-posterior and medio-lateral axes.

One representative solution is to directly learn an\nembedding function associating visual features with corresponding class\nsemantics for recognizing new classes.

These attribute features are normally extracted within\neach individual image; however, the common traits for features across images\nyet belonging to the same attribute are not emphasized. In this paper, we\npropose a new framework to boost ZSL by explicitly learning attribute\nprototypes beyond images and contrastively optimizing them with attribute-level\nfeatures within images. Besides the novel architecture, two elements are\nhighlighted for attribute representations: a new prototype generation module is\ndesigned to generate attribute prototypes from attribute semantics; a hard\nexample-based contrastive optimization scheme is introduced to reinforce\nattribute-level features in the embedding space.

In this paper, we\npresent an experiment we did to explore minimalism in games using a bottom-up\napproach. We invited a small group of professional game designers and a larger\ngroup of game design students to participate in a seminal experiment on\nminimalism in game design. We started from the most basic game elements: one\npixel and one key which provide the least amount of information we can display\nand reasonably the most elementary action players can perform. We designed a\ngame that starts with a black pixel and asks players to press a key when the\npixel turns white. This minimal game, almost a Skinner box, captures the\nessential elements of the mechanics of games like \"The Impossible Game,\" which\nasks players to do nothing more than press a key at the right moment. We\npresented this game concept to the professional game designers and challenged\nthem to create other games with the least amount of player interaction and\ndisplayed information.

Nevertheless, efficiency is an important part of\nsuch systems and should not be overlooked.\nIn this paper, we focus on improving the efficiency of the SPLADE model since\nit has achieved state-of-the-art zero-shot performance and competitive results\non TREC collections. SPLADE efficiency can be controlled via a regularization\nfactor, but solely controlling this regularization has been shown to not be\nefficient enough. In order to reduce the latency gap between SPLADE and\ntraditional retrieval systems, we propose several techniques including L1\nregularization for queries, a separation of document/query encoders, a\nFLOPS-regularized middle-training, and the use of faster query encoders. Our\nbenchmark demonstrates that we can drastically improve the efficiency of these\nmodels while increasing the performance metrics on in-domain data. To our\nknowledge, {we propose the first neural models that, under the same computing\nconstraints, \\textit{achieve similar latency (less than 4ms difference) as\ntraditional BM25}, while having \\textit{similar performance (less than 10\\%\nMRR@10 reduction)} as the state-of-the-art single-stage neural rankers on\nin-domain data}.",

    "abstract": "Recently, stochastic rounding (SR) has been implemented in specialized\nhardware but most current computing nodes do not yet support this rounding\nmode. Several works empirically illustrate the benefit of stochastic rounding\nin various fields such as neural networks and ordinary differential equations.\nFor some algorithms, such as summation, inner product or matrixvector\nmultiplication, it has been proved that SR provides probabilistic error bounds\nbetter than the traditional deterministic bounds. In this paper, we extend this\ntheoretical ground for a wider adoption of SR in computer architecture. First,\nwe analyze the biases of the two SR modes: SR-nearness and SR-up-or-down. We\ndemonstrate on a case-study of Euler's forward method that IEEE-754 default\nrounding modes and SR-up-or-down accumulate rounding errors across iterations\nand that SR-nearness, being unbiased, does not. Second, we prove a O($\\sqrt$ n)\nprobabilistic bound on the forward error of Horner's polynomial evaluation\nmethod with SR, improving on the known deterministic O(n) bound.",

    "abstract": "Currently, under supervised learning, a model pretrained by a large-scale\nnature scene dataset and then fine-tuned on a few specific task labeling data\nis the paradigm that has dominated the knowledge transfer learning. It has\nreached the status of consensus solution for task-aware model training in\nremote sensing domain (RSD). Unfortunately, due to different categories of\nimaging data and stiff challenges of data annotation, there is not a large\nenough and uniform remote sensing dataset to support large-scale pretraining in\nRSD. Moreover, pretraining models on large-scale nature scene datasets by\nsupervised learning and then directly fine-tuning on diverse downstream tasks\nseems to be a crude method, which is easily affected by inevitable labeling\nnoise, severe domain gaps and task-aware discrepancies. Thus, in this paper,\nconsidering the self-supervised pretraining and powerful vision transformer\n(ViT) architecture, a concise and effective knowledge transfer learning\nstrategy called ConSecutive PreTraining (CSPT) is proposed based on the idea of\nnot stopping pretraining in natural language processing (NLP), which can\ngradually bridge the domain gap and transfer knowledge from the nature scene\ndomain to the RSD. The proposed CSPT also can release the huge potential of\nunlabeled data for task-aware model training. Finally, extensive experiments\nare carried out on twelve datasets in RSD involving three types of downstream\ntasks (e.g., scene classification, object detection and land cover\nclassification) and two types of imaging data (e.g., optical and SAR). The\nresults show that by utilizing the proposed CSPT for task-aware model training,\nalmost all downstream tasks in RSD can outperform the previous method of\nsupervised pretraining-then-fine-tuning and even surpass the state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) performance without any expensive labeling consumption and careful model\ndesign.",

    "abstract": "Background: In the information extraction and natural language processing\ndomain, accessible datasets are crucial to reproduce and compare results.\nPublicly available implementations and tools can serve as benchmark and\nfacilitate the development of more complex applications. However, in the\ncontext of clinical text processing the number of accessible datasets is scarce\n-- and so is the number of existing tools. One of the main reasons is the\nsensitivity of the data. This problem is even more evident for non-English\nlanguages.\nApproach: In order to address this situation, we introduce a workbench: a\ncollection of German clinical text processing models. The models are trained on\na de-identified corpus of German nephrology reports.\nResult: The presented models provide promising results on in-domain data.\nMoreover, we show that our models can be also successfully applied to other\nbiomedical text in German. Our workbench is made publicly available so it can\nbe used out of the box, as a benchmark or transferred to related problems.",

    "abstract": "Generative networks are fundamentally different in their aim and methods\ncompared to CNNs for classification, segmentation, or object detection. They\nhave initially not been meant to be an image analysis tool, but to produce\nnaturally looking images. The adversarial training paradigm has been proposed\nto stabilize generative methods, and has proven to be highly successful --\nthough by no means from the first attempt.\nThis chapter gives a basic introduction into the motivation for Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GANs) and traces the path of their success by abstracting\nthe basic task and working mechanism, and deriving the difficulty of early\npractical approaches. Methods for a more stable training will be shown, and\nalso typical signs for poor convergence and their reasons.\nThough this chapter focuses on GANs that are meant for image generation and\nimage analysis, the adversarial training paradigm itself is not specific to\nimages, and also generalizes to tasks in image analysis. Examples of\narchitectures for image semantic segmentation and abnormality detection will be\nacclaimed, before contrasting GANs with further generative modeling approaches\nlately entering the scene. This will allow a contextualized view on the limits\nbut also benefits of GANs.",

    "title": "Encoding NetFlows for State-Machine Learning",
    "abstract": "NetFlow data is a well-known network log format used by many network analysts\nand researchers. The advantages of using this format compared to pcap are that\nit contains fewer data, is less privacy intrusive, and is easier to collect and\nprocess. However, having less data does mean that this format might not be able\nto capture important network behaviour as all information is summarised into\nstatistics. Much research aims to overcome this disadvantage through the use of\nmachine learning, for instance, to detect attacks within a network. Many\napproaches can be used to pre-process the NetFlow data before it is used to\ntrain the machine learning algorithms. However, many of these approaches simply\napply existing methods to the data, not considering the specific properties of\nnetwork data. We argue that for data originating from software systems, such as\nNetFlow or software logs, similarities in frequency and contexts of feature\nvalues are more important than similarities in the value itself. In this work,\nwe, therefore, propose an encoding algorithm that directly takes the frequency\nand the context of the feature values into account when the data is being\nprocessed. Different types of network behaviours can be clustered using this\nencoding, thus aiding the process of detecting anomalies within the network.\nFrom windows of these clusters obtained from monitoring a clean system, we\nlearn state machine behavioural models for anomaly detection. These models are\nvery well-suited to modelling the cyclic and repetitive patterns present in\nNetFlow data. We evaluate our encoding on a new dataset that we created for\ndetecting problems in Kubernetes clusters and on two well-known public NetFlow\ndatasets. The obtained performance results of the state machine models are\ncomparable to existing works that use many more features and require both clean\nand infected data as training input.",

In this paper, we first introduce a variation of the Badnet\nkind of attacks that introduces Trojan backdoors to multiple target classes and\nallows triggers to be placed anywhere in the image. The former makes it more\npotent and the latter makes it extremely easy to carry out the attack in the\nphysical space. The state-of-the-art Trojan detection methods fail with this\nthreat model. To defend against this attack, we first introduce a trigger\nreverse-engineering mechanism that uses multiple images to recover a variety of\npotential triggers. We then propose a detection mechanism by measuring the\ntransferability of such recovered triggers. A Trojan trigger will have very\nhigh transferability i.e. they make other images also go to the same class. We\nstudy many practical advantages of our attack method and then demonstrate the\ndetection performance using a variety of image datasets.

    "abstract": "Deep cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning has demonstrated its\nremarkable success over a wide spectrum of complex control tasks. However,\nrecent advances in multi-agent learning mainly focus on value decomposition\nwhile leaving entity interactions still intertwined, which easily leads to\nover-fitting on noisy interactions between entities. In this work, we introduce\na novel interactiOn Pattern disenTangling (OPT) method, to disentangle not only\nthe joint value function into agent-wise value functions for decentralized\nexecution, but also the entity interactions into interaction prototypes, each\nof which represents an underlying interaction pattern within a sub-group of the\nentities. OPT facilitates filtering the noisy interactions between irrelevant\nentities and thus significantly improves generalizability as well as\ninterpretability. Specifically, OPT introduces a sparse disagreement mechanism\nto encourage sparsity and diversity among discovered interaction prototypes.\nThen the model selectively restructures these prototypes into a compact\ninteraction pattern by an aggregator with learnable weights. To alleviate the\ntraining instability issue caused by partial observability, we propose to\nmaximize the mutual information between the aggregation weights and the history\nbehaviors of each agent. Experiments on both single-task and multi-task\nbenchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method yields results superior to the\nstate-of-the-art counterparts.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the privacy preservation problem in a cooperative\nnetworked control system working for the task of LQG control. The system\nconsists of a user and a server: the user owns the state process, the server\nprovides computation capability, and the user employs the server to compute\ncontrol inputs for it. To enable the server's computation, the user needs to\nprovide the measurements of the process states to the server. However, the user\nregards the states as privacy and wants the server to have deviated knowledge\nof the state estimates rather than the true value. Regarding that, we propose a\nnovel local design of privacy preservation, which creates a deviation in the\nserver's knowledge of the state estimates from the true value. Meanwhile, we\npropose an associated privacy metric to measure the deviation and analyze the\nprivacy performance accordingly. Furthermore, we analyze the service loss in\nthe LQG control performance caused by the privacy scheme. Finally, we study the\nperformance trade-off between the privacy preservation and the LQG control,\nwhere the proposed optimization problems are solved by numerical methods\nefficiently.",

    "abstract": "The ensemble random forest filter (ERFF) is presented as an alternative to\nthe ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for the purpose of inverse modeling. The EnKF\nis a data assimilation approach that forecasts and updates parameter estimates\nsequentially in time as observations are being collected. The updating step is\nbased on the experimental covariances computed from an ensemble of realizations\nand the updates are given as linear combinations of the differences between\nobservations and forecasted system state values. The ERFF replaces the linear\ncombination in the update step with a non-linear function represented by a\nrandom forest. In this way, the non-linear relationships between the parameters\nto be updated and the observations can be captured and a better update\nproduced. The ERFF is demonstrated for the purpose of log-conductivity\nidentification from piezometric head observations in a number of scenarios with\nvarying degrees of heterogeneity (log-conductivity variances going from 1 up to\n6.25 (ln m/d)2), number of realizations in the ensemble (50 or 100), and number\nof piezometric head observations (18 or 36). In all scenarios, the ERFF works\nwell, being able to reconstruct the log-conductivity spatial heterogeneity\nwhile matching the observed piezometric heads at selected control points. For\nbenchmarking purposes the ERFF is compared to the restart EnKF to find that the\nERFF is superior to the EnKF for the number of ensemble realizations used\n(small in typical EnKF applications). Only when the number of realizations\ngrows to 500, the restart EnKF is able to match the performance of the ERFF,\nalbeit at triple the computational cost.",

The\nstandard approach that uses aggregated models for the inverter-interfaced\ngeneration and conventional load models introduces significant errors to the\ndynamic modeling that can lead to instabilities. This paper presents a new\napproach based on quantile forecasting to represent the uncertainty originating\nin DNs at the TN level.

Then, we use machine learning (ML) algorithms\nto not only predict the most probable response but also intervals of potential\nresponses with predefined confidence. These quantile methods represent the\nvariance in DN responses at the TN level. The results indicate excellent\nperformance for most ML techniques. The tuned quantile equivalents predict\naccurate bands for the current at the TN/DN-interface, and tests with unseen TN\nconditions indicate robustness.

    "abstract": "Change-point detection (CPD), which detects abrupt changes in the data\ndistribution, is recognized as one of the most significant tasks in time series\nanalysis. Despite the extensive literature on offline CPD, unsupervised online\nCPD still suffers from major challenges, including scalability, hyperparameter\ntuning, and learning constraints. To mitigate some of these challenges, in this\npaper, we propose a novel deep learning approach for unsupervised online CPD\nfrom multi-dimensional time series, named Adaptive LSTM-Autoencoder\nChange-Point Detection (ALACPD). ALACPD exploits an LSTM-autoencoder-based\nneural network to perform unsupervised online CPD. It continuously adapts to\nthe incoming samples without keeping the previously received input, thus being\nmemory-free. We perform an extensive evaluation on several real-world time\nseries CPD benchmarks. We show that ALACPD, on average, ranks first among\nstate-of-the-art CPD algorithms in terms of quality of the time series\nsegmentation, and it is on par with the best performer in terms of the accuracy\nof the estimated change-points. The implementation of ALACPD is available\nonline on Github\\footnote{\\url{https://github.com/zahraatashgahi/ALACPD}}.",

    "abstract": "The detection of anomalous behaviours is an emerging need in many\napplications, particularly in contexts where security and reliability are\ncritical aspects. While the definition of anomaly strictly depends on the\ndomain framework, it is often impractical or too time consuming to obtain a\nfully labelled dataset. The use of unsupervised models to overcome the lack of\nlabels often fails to catch domain specific anomalies as they rely on general\ndefinitions of outlier. This paper suggests a new active learning based\napproach, ALIF, to solve this problem by reducing the number of required labels\nand tuning the detector towards the definition of anomaly provided by the user.\nThe proposed approach is particularly appealing in the presence of a Decision\nSupport System (DSS), a case that is increasingly popular in real-world\nscenarios. While it is common that DSS embedded with anomaly detection\ncapabilities rely on unsupervised models, they don't have a way to improve\ntheir performance: ALIF is able to enhance the capabilities of DSS by\nexploiting the user feedback during common operations. ALIF is a lightweight\nmodification of the popular Isolation Forest that proved superior performances\nwith respect to other state-of-art algorithms in a multitude of real anomaly\ndetection datasets.",

Our approach is very\ndifferent, however: it is based on the celebrated method of Chambolle and Pock\n(2011), with several nontrivial modifications: i) we allow for an inexact\ncomputation of the prox operator of a certain smooth strongly convex function\nvia a suitable gradient-based method (e.g., GD, Fast GD or FSFOM), ii) we\nperform a careful modification of the dual update step in order to retain\nlinear convergence. Our general results offer the new state-of-the-art rates\nfor the class of strongly convex-concave saddle-point problems with bilinear\ncoupling characterized by the absence of smoothness in the dual function. When\napplied to federated learning, we obtain a theoretically better alternative to\nProxSkip: our method requires fewer local steps ($O(\\kappa^{1/3})$ or\n$O(\\kappa^{1/4})$, compared to $O(\\kappa^{1/2})$ of ProxSkip), and performs a\ndeterministic number of local steps instead.

    "abstract": "Optimal linear feedback control design is a valuable but challenging problem\ndue to nonconvexity of the underlying optimization and infinite dimensionality\nof the Hardy space of stabilizing controllers. A powerful class of techniques\nfor solving optimal control problems involves using reparameterization to\ntransform the control design to a convex but infinite dimensional optimization.\nTo make the problem tractable, historical work focuses on Galerkin-type finite\ndimensional approximations to Hardy space, especially those involving Lorentz\nseries approximations such as the finite impulse response appproximation.\nHowever, Lorentz series approximations can lead to infeasibility, difficulty\nincorporating prior knowledge, deadbeat control in the case of finite impulse\nresponse, and increased suboptimality, especially for systems with large\nseparation of time scales. The goal of this two-part article is to introduce a\nnew Galerkin-type method based on approximation by transfer functions with a\nselection of simple poles, and to apply this simple pole approximation for\noptimal control design. In Part I, error bounds for approximating arbitrary\ntransfer functions in Hardy space are provided based on the geometry of the\npole selection. It is shown that the space of transfer functions with these\nsimple poles converges to the full Hardy space, and a uniform convergence rate\nis provided based purely on the geometry of the pole selection. This is then\nspecialized to derive a convergence rate for a particularly interesting pole\nselection based on an Archimedes spiral. In Part II, the simple pole\napproximation is combined with system level synthesis, a recent\nreparameterization approach, to develop a new control design method. This\ntechnique is convex and tractable, always feasible, can include prior\nknowledge, does not result in deadbeat control, and works well for systems with\nlarge separation of tim",

    "title": "Tackling Heterogeneous Traffic in Multi-access Systems via Erasure Coded  Servers",
    "abstract": "Most data generated by modern applications is stored in the cloud, and there\nis an exponential growth in the volume of jobs to access these data and perform\ncomputations using them. The volume of data access or computing jobs can be\nheterogeneous across different job types and can unpredictably change over\ntime. Cloud service providers cope with this demand heterogeneity and\nunpredictability by over-provisioning the number of servers hosting each job\ntype. In this paper, we propose the addition of erasure-coded servers that can\nflexibly serve multiple job types without additional storage cost. We analyze\nthe service capacity region and the response time of such erasure-coded systems\nand compare them with standard uncoded replication-based systems currently used\nin the cloud. We show that coding expands the service capacity region, thus\nenabling the system to handle variability in demand for different data types.\nMoreover, we characterize the response time of the coded system in various\narrival rate regimes. This analysis reveals that adding even a small number of\ncoded servers can significantly reduce the mean response time, with a drastic\nreduction in regimes where the demand is skewed across different job types.",

    "abstract": "Opinion formation and propagation are crucial phenomena in social networks\nand have been extensively studied across several disciplines. Traditionally,\ntheoretical models of opinion dynamics have been proposed to describe the\ninteractions between individuals (i.e., social interaction) and their impact on\nthe evolution of collective opinions. Although these models can incorporate\nsociological and psychological knowledge on the mechanisms of social\ninteraction, they demand extensive calibration with real data to make reliable\npredictions, requiring much time and effort. Recently, the widespread use of\nsocial media platforms provides new paradigms to learn deep learning models\nfrom a large volume of social media data. However, these methods ignore any\nscientific knowledge about the mechanism of social interaction. In this work,\nwe present the first hybrid method called Sociologically-Informed Neural\nNetwork (SINN), which integrates theoretical models and social media data by\ntransporting the concepts of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) from\nnatural science (i.e., physics) into social science (i.e., sociology and social\npsychology). In particular, we recast theoretical models as ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODEs). Then we train a neural network that\nsimultaneously approximates the data and conforms to the ODEs that represent\nthe social scientific knowledge. In addition, we extend PINNs by integrating\nmatrix factorization and a language model to incorporate rich side information\n(e.g., user profiles) and structural knowledge (e.g., cluster structure of the\nsocial interaction network). Moreover, we develop an end-to-end training\nprocedure for SINN, which involves Gumbel-Softmax approximation to include\nstochastic mechanisms of social interaction. Extensive experiments on\nreal-world and synthetic datasets show SINN outperforms six baseline methods in\npredicting opinion dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Nested datatypes have been widely studied in the past 25 years, both\ntheoretically using category theory, and practically in programming languages\nsuch as Haskell. They consist in recursive polymorphic datatypes where the type\nparameter changes throughout the recursion. They have a variety of applications\nsuch as modelling memory or modelling constraints over regular datatypes\nwithout relying on dependent types. In this work, we focus on a specific subset\nof nested datatypes which we call Linked Nested DataTypes (LNDT). We show that\nsome usual datatypes such has List and Maybe, as well as some well-known nested\ndatatypes such as Nest and even Bush can be built as various instances of LNDT.\nWe proceed by presenting LibNDT, a library, developed both in Agda and Coq,\nwhich focuses on the set of constructs that can be spread directly from the\nparameter on which a LNDT is built, to the LNDT itself. These spreadable\nelements are of two kinds, functions, such as folds and map, and properties,\nsuch as the congruence of map or the satisfaction of a given predicate for at\nleast one, or all, elements of the structure. We make use of the dependent type\nsystem of both Coq and Agda to model the latter.

However, much of the past work on abusive\nlanguage detection assumes that classifiers operate in a static language\nenvironment, despite language and news being in a state of constant flux. In\nthis paper, we show using a new German newspaper comments dataset that the\nclassifiers trained with naive ML techniques like a random-test train split\nwill underperform on future data, and that a time stratified evaluation split\nis more appropriate. We also show that classifier performance rapidly degrades\nwhen evaluated on data from a different period than the training data.

The source wishes to transmit an\ninfinite stream of packets to the destination via the relay. The three-node D&F\nrelay network is constrained by a decoding delay of T packets, i.e., the packet\ntransmitted by the source at time i must be decoded by the destination by time\ni+T. For the individual channels from source to relay and relay to destination,\nwe assume a delay-constrained sliding-window (DCSW) based packet-erasure model\nthat can be viewed as a tractable approximation to the commonly-accepted\nGilbert-Elliot channel model. Under the model, any time-window of width w\ncontains either up to a random erasure or else erasure burst of length at most\nb (>= a). Thus the source-relay and relay-destination channels are modeled as\n(a_1, b_1, w_1, T_1) and (a_2, b_2, w_2, T_2) DCSW channels. We first derive an\nupper bound on the capacity of the three-node D&F relay network. We then show\nthat the upper bound is tight for the parameter regime: max{b_1,\nb_2}|(T-b_1-b_2-max{a_1, a_2}+1), a1=a2 OR b1=b2 by constructing streaming\ncodes achieving the bound.

This paper is motivated to build a\nmulti-tasking deep learning model that possesses a Share-Split-Collaborate\narchitecture. This architecture allows the two classification tasks to share\nthe feature extractor and then split subject-specific and keyword-specific\nfeatures intertwined in the extracted features through feature projection and\ncollaborative training.

Its mean accuracy in speaker classification is\n99.2%. Due to the richer keyword representations that the model learns from the\npooled training data, adapting the base model to a new inspector requires only\na little training data from that inspector, like five utterances per keyword.\nUsing the speaker classification scores for inspector verification can achieve\na success rate of at least 93.9% in verifying authorized inspectors and 76.1\\%\nin detecting unauthorized ones.

    "title": "Flux: Liquid Types for Rust",
    "abstract": "Low-level pointer-manipulating programs are hard to verify, requiring complex\nspatial program logics that support reasoning about aliasing and separation.\nWorse, when working over collections, these logics burden the programmer with\nannotating loops with quantified invariants that describe the contents of the\ncollection. We present Flux, which shows how logical refinements can work hand\nin glove with Rust's ownership mechanisms to yield ergonomic type-based\nverification for low-level imperative code. To do so Flux indexes mutable\nlocations, with pure (immutable) values that can appear in the refinements, and\nthen exploits Rust's ownership mechanisms to abstract sub-structural reasoning\nabout locations within Rust's polymorphic type constructors, extended by a\nnotion of strong references to idiomatically track strong updates. By factoring\ncomplex invariants into type constructors and simple refinements, Flux can\nefficiently synthesize loop annotations via liquid inference. We use a suite of\nvector-manipulating programs to demonstrate the advantages of Flux's refinement\ntypes over program logics, as implemented in the state-of-the-art Prusti\nverifier. We show that liquid typing makes verification ergonomic by slashing\nspecification lines by a factor of two, verification time by an order of\nmagnitude, and invariant annotation overhead from 14% of code size, to nothing\nat all.",

    "abstract": "As part of the effort to understand implicit bias of gradient descent in\noverparametrized models, several results have shown how the training trajectory\non the overparametrized model can be understood as mirror descent on a\ndifferent objective. The main result here is a characterization of this\nphenomenon under a notion termed commuting parametrization, which encompasses\nall the previous results in this setting. It is shown that gradient flow with\nany commuting parametrization is equivalent to continuous mirror descent with a\nrelated Legendre function. Conversely, continuous mirror descent with any\nLegendre function can be viewed as gradient flow with a related commuting\nparametrization. The latter result relies upon Nash's embedding theorem.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen renewed attention to arithmetic coding (AC). This is\nthanks to the use of AC for distribution matching (DM) to control the channel\ninput distribution in probabilistic amplitude shaping. There are two main\nproblems inherent to AC: (1) its required arithmetic precision grows linearly\nwith the input length, and (2) high-precision multiplications and divisions are\nrequired. Here, we introduce a multiplication-free AC-based DM technique via\nthree lookup tables (LUTs) which solves both problems above. These LUTs are\nused to approximate the high-precision multiplications and divisions by\nadditions and subtractions. The required precision of our approach is shown to\ngrow logarithmically with the input length. We prove that this approximate\ntechnique maintains the invertibility of DM. At an input length of 1024\nsymbols, the proposed technique achieves negligible rate loss ($<0.01$ bit/sym)\nagainst the full-precision DM, while requiring less than 4 kilobytes of\nstorage.",

    "abstract": "Innovation is a major driver of economic and social development, and\ninformation about many kinds of innovation is embedded in semi-structured data\nfrom patents and patent applications. Although the impact and novelty of\ninnovations expressed in patent data are difficult to measure through\ntraditional means, ML offers a promising set of techniques for evaluating\nnovelty, summarizing contributions, and embedding semantics. In this paper, we\nintroduce the Harvard USPTO Patent Dataset (HUPD), a large-scale,\nwell-structured, and multi-purpose corpus of English-language patent\napplications filed to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)\nbetween 2004 and 2018. With more than 4.5 million patent documents, HUPD is two\nto three times larger than comparable corpora. Unlike previously proposed\npatent datasets in NLP, HUPD contains the inventor-submitted versions of patent\napplications--not the final versions of granted patents--thereby allowing us to\nstudy patentability at the time of filing using NLP methods for the first time.\nIt is also novel in its inclusion of rich structured metadata alongside the\ntext of patent filings: By providing each application's metadata along with all\nof its text fields, the dataset enables researchers to perform new sets of NLP\ntasks that leverage variation in structured covariates. As a case study on the\ntypes of research HUPD makes possible, we introduce a new task to the NLP\ncommunity--namely, binary classification of patent decisions. We additionally\nshow the structured metadata provided in the dataset enables us to conduct\nexplicit studies of concept shifts for this task. Finally, we demonstrate how\nHUPD can be used for three additional tasks: multi-class classification of\npatent subject areas, language modeling, and summarization.",

    "abstract": "The rise of transformers in vision tasks not only advances network backbone\ndesigns, but also starts a brand-new page to achieve end-to-end image\nrecognition (e.g., object detection and panoptic segmentation). Originated from\nNatural Language Processing (NLP), transformer architectures, consisting of\nself-attention and cross-attention, effectively learn long-range interactions\nbetween elements in a sequence. However, we observe that most existing\ntransformer-based vision models simply borrow the idea from NLP, neglecting the\ncrucial difference between languages and images, particularly the extremely\nlarge sequence length of spatially flattened pixel features. This subsequently\nimpedes the learning in cross-attention between pixel features and object\nqueries. In this paper, we rethink the relationship between pixels and object\nqueries and propose to reformulate the cross-attention learning as a clustering\nprocess. Inspired by the traditional k-means clustering algorithm, we develop a\nk-means Mask Xformer (kMaX-DeepLab) for segmentation tasks, which not only\nimproves the state-of-the-art, but also enjoys a simple and elegant design. As\na result, our kMaX-DeepLab achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on COCO\nval set with 58.0% PQ, and Cityscapes val set with 68.4% PQ, 44.0% AP, and\n83.5% mIoU without test-time augmentation or external dataset.

Applications include: optimization over low-rank matrices and\ntensors by optimizing over a factorization; the Burer-Monteiro approach to\nsemidefinite programs; training neural networks by optimizing over their\nweights and biases; and quotienting out symmetries. In all these examples, one\nof the two problems is smooth, and hence can be tackled with algorithms for\noptimization on manifolds. These can find desirable points (e.g., critical\npoints). We determine the properties that ensure these map to desirable points\nfor the other problem via the smooth parametrization.

Weight-bearing\ncomputed tomography (WBCT) has shown promising potential for early and reliable\ndetection of isolated syndesmotic instability using 3D volumetric measurements.\nWhile these measurements have been reported to be highly accurate, they are\nalso experience-dependent, time-consuming, and need a particular 3D measurement\nsoftware tool that leads the clinicians to still show more interest in the\nconventional diagnostic methods for syndesmotic instability.

For the case where $P$ and $Q$ are both $\\| \\cdot\n\\|_p$-balls we prove an upper bound of $\\sqrt{ \\frac{\\min\\{ p, \\log\n(\\frac{2m}{k}) \\}}{k}}$. Interestingly, this bound cannot be obtained taking\nindependent random samples; instead we use the Lovett-Meka random walk. We also\nprove an extension to the more general case where $P$ and $Q$ are $\\|\\cdot\n\\|_p$ and $\\| \\cdot \\|_q$-balls with $2 \\leq p \\leq q \\leq \\infty$.",

    "abstract": "A Hadamard matrix is balanced splittable if some subset of its rows has the\nproperty that the dot product of every two distinct columns takes at most two\nvalues. This definition was introduced by Kharaghani and Suda in 2019, although\nequivalent formulations have been previously studied using different\nterminology. We collate previous results phrased in terms of balanced\nsplittable Hadamard matrices, real flat equiangular tight frames, spherical\ntwo-distance sets, and two-distance tight frames. We use combinatorial analysis\nto restrict the parameters of a balanced splittable Hadamard matrix to lie in\none of several classes, and obtain strong new constraints on their mutual\nrelationships. An important consideration in determining these classes is\nwhether the strongly regular graph associated with the balanced splittable\nHadamard matrix is primitive or imprimitive. We construct new infinite families\nof balanced splittable Hadamard matrices in both the primitive and imprimitive\ncases. A rich source of examples is provided by packings of partial difference\nsets in elementary abelian 2-groups, from which we construct Hadamard matrices\nadmitting a row decomposition so that the balanced splittable property holds\nsimultaneously with respect to every union of the submatrices of the\ndecomposition.",

    "title": "Integrated Sensing and Communication with Delay Alignment Modulation:  Performance Analysis and Beamforming Optimization",
    "abstract": "Delay alignment modulation (DAM) has been recently proposed to enable\nmanipulable channel delay spread for efficient single- or multi-carrier\ncommunications. In particular, with perfect delay alignment, inter-symbol\ninterference (ISI) can be eliminated even with single-carrier (SC)\ntransmission, without relying on sophisticated channel equalization. The key\nideas of DAM are delay pre-compensation and path-based beamforming, so that all\nmulti-path signal components may arrive at the receiver simultaneously and be\nsuperimposed constructively, rather than causing the detrimental ISI. Compared\nto the classic orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission,\nDAM-enabled SC communication has several appealing advantages, including low\npeak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) and high tolerance for Doppler frequency\nshift, which renders DAM also appealing for radar sensing. Therefore, in this\npaper, DAM is investigated for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)\nsystems. We first study the output signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for ISI-free\nSC communication and radar sensing, and then derive the closed-form expressions\nfor DAM-based sensing in terms of the ambiguity function (AF) and integrated\nsidelobe ratio (ISR). Furthermore, we study the beamforming design problem for\nDAM-based ISAC to maximize the communication SNR while guaranteeing the sensing\nperformance in terms of the sensing SNR and ISR. Finally, we provide\nperformance comparison between DAM and OFDM for ISAC, and it is revealed that\nDAM signal may achieve better communication and sensing performance, thanks to\nits low PAPR, reduced guard interval overhead, as well as higher tolerance for\nDoppler frequency shift. Simulation results are provided to show the great\npotential of DAM for ISAC.",

In this\npaper, to achieve speaker diarisation and speech recognition using a single\nmodel, a tandem multitask training (TMT) method is proposed to fine-tune W2V2.\nFor speaker diarisation, the tasks of voice activity detection (VAD) and\nspeaker classification (SC) are required, and connectionist temporal\nclassification (CTC) is used for ASR. The multitask framework implements VAD,\nSC, and ASR using an early layer, middle layer, and late layer of W2V2, which\ncoincides with the order of segmenting the audio with VAD, clustering the\nsegments based on speaker embeddings, and transcribing each segment with ASR.\nExperimental results on the augmented multi-party (AMI) dataset showed that\nusing different W2V2 layers for VAD, SC, and ASR from the earlier to later\nlayers for TMT not only saves computational cost, but also reduces diarisation\nerror rates (DERs).

In this paper, we propose a framework to improve the classification\nperformance by using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). As substantial\nefforts and expertise are required to annotate spectrograms, the number of\ntraining examples is very limited. However, it is well known that deep networks\ncan perform well only when the sample size of the training set is sufficiently\nlarge. Furthermore, the imbalanced sample sizes in different classes can also\nhamper the performance. In order to tackle these problems, we propose a\nGAN-based data augmentation framework. While standard data augmentation methods\nfor conventional images cannot be applied on spectrograms, we found that a\nvariant of GANs, ProGAN, is capable of generating high-resolution spectrograms\nwhich are consistent with the quality of the high-resolution original images\nand provide a desirable diversity. We have validated our framework by\nclassifying glitches in the {\\it Gravity Spy} dataset with the GAN-generated\nspectrograms for training. We show that the proposed method can provide an\nalternative to transfer learning for the classification of spectrograms using\ndeep networks, i.e. using a high-resolution GAN for data augmentation instead.\nFurthermore, fluctuations in classification performance with small sample sizes\nfor training and evaluation can be greatly reduced.
