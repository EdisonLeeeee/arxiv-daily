    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the Online Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (OUDA)\nproblem and propose a novel multi-stage framework to solve real-world\nsituations when the target data are unlabeled and arriving online sequentially\nin batches. To project the data from the source and the target domains to a\ncommon subspace and manipulate the projected data in real-time, our proposed\nframework institutes a novel method, called an Incremental Computation of\nMean-Subspace (ICMS) technique, which computes an approximation of mean-target\nsubspace on a Grassmann manifold and is proven to be a close approximate to the\nKarcher mean. Furthermore, the transformation matrix computed from the\nmean-target subspace is applied to the next target data in the\nrecursive-feedback stage, aligning the target data closer to the source domain.\nThe computation of transformation matrix and the prediction of next-target\nsubspace leverage the performance of the recursive-feedback stage by\nconsidering the cumulative temporal dependency among the flow of the target\nsubspace on the Grassmann manifold. The labels of the transformed target data\nare predicted by the pre-trained source classifier, then the classifier is\nupdated by the transformed data and predicted labels. Extensive experiments on\nsix datasets were conducted to investigate in depth the effect and contribution\nof each stage in our proposed framework and its performance over previous\napproaches in terms of classification accuracy and computational speed. In\naddition, the experiments on traditional manifold-based learning models and\nneural-network-based learning models demonstrated the applicability of our\nproposed framework for various types of learning models.",

    "abstract": "Standard deep learning-based classification approaches require collecting all\nsamples from all classes in advance and are trained offline. This paradigm may\nnot be practical in real-world clinical applications, where new classes are\nincrementally introduced through the addition of new data. Class incremental\nlearning is a strategy allowing learning from such data. However, a major\nchallenge is catastrophic forgetting, i.e., performance degradation on previous\nclasses when adapting a trained model to new data. Prior methodologies to\nalleviate this challenge save a portion of training data require perpetual\nstorage of such data that may introduce privacy issues. Here, we propose a\nnovel data-free class incremental learning framework that first synthesizes\ndata from the model trained on previous classes to generate a \\ours.\nSubsequently, it updates the model by combining the synthesized data with new\nclass data. Furthermore, we incorporate a cosine normalized Cross-entropy loss\nto mitigate the adverse effects of the imbalance, a margin loss to increase\nseparation among previous classes and new ones, and an intra-domain contrastive\nloss to generalize the model trained on the synthesized data to real data.

This\nstudy developed multiple application components in order to investigate the\ndevelopment challenges and choices for fall detection systems, and provide\nmaterials for future research.

    "abstract": "Benefiting from the message passing mechanism, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)\nhave been successful on flourish tasks over graph data. However, recent studies\nhave shown that attackers can catastrophically degrade the performance of GNNs\nby maliciously modifying the graph structure. A straightforward solution to\nremedy this issue is to model the edge weights by learning a metric function\nbetween pairwise representations of two end nodes, which attempts to assign low\nweights to adversarial edges. The existing methods use either raw features or\nrepresentations learned by supervised GNNs to model the edge weights. However,\nboth strategies are faced with some immediate problems: raw features cannot\nrepresent various properties of nodes (e.g., structure information), and\nrepresentations learned by supervised GNN may suffer from the poor performance\nof the classifier on the poisoned graph. We need representations that carry\nboth feature information and as mush correct structure information as possible\nand are insensitive to structural perturbations. To this end, we propose an\nunsupervised pipeline, named STABLE, to optimize the graph structure. Finally,\nwe input the well-refined graph into a downstream classifier. For this part, we\ndesign an advanced GCN that significantly enhances the robustness of vanilla\nGCN without increasing the time complexity.

    "abstract": "The past several years have witnessed the success of transformer-based\nmodels, and their scale and application scenarios continue to grow\naggressively. The current landscape of transformer models is increasingly\ndiverse: the model size varies drastically with the largest being of\nhundred-billion parameters; the model characteristics differ due to the\nsparsity introduced by the Mixture-of-Experts; the target application scenarios\ncan be latency-critical or throughput-oriented; the deployment hardware could\nbe single- or multi-GPU systems with different types of memory and storage,\netc. With such increasing diversity and the fast-evolving pace of transformer\nmodels, designing a highly performant and efficient inference system is\nextremely challenging. In this paper, we present DeepSpeed Inference, a\ncomprehensive system solution for transformer model inference to address the\nabove-mentioned challenges. DeepSpeed Inference consists of (1) a multi-GPU\ninference solution to minimize latency while maximizing the throughput of both\ndense and sparse transformer models when they fit in aggregate GPU memory, and\n(2) a heterogeneous inference solution that leverages CPU and NVMe memory in\naddition to the GPU memory and compute to enable high inference throughput with\nlarge models which do not fit in aggregate GPU memory. DeepSpeed Inference\nreduces latency by up to 7.3X over the state-of-the-art for latency-oriented\nscenarios and increases throughput by over 1.5x for throughput-oriented\nscenarios. Moreover, it enables trillion parameter scale inference under\nreal-time latency constraints by leveraging hundreds of GPUs, an unprecedented\nscale for inference. It can inference 25x larger models than with GPU-only\nsolutions, while delivering a high throughput of 84 TFLOPS (over $50\\%$ of\nA6000 peak).",

However, the lack of inductive bias makes this system data-inefficient\nand impractical in scenarios like search and rescue, where interacting with the\nenvironment to collect data is costly. We hypothesize a sufficient\nrepresentation of the current view and the goal view for a navigation policy\ncan be learned by predicting the location and size of a crop of the current\nview that corresponds to the goal. We further show that training such random\ncrop prediction in a self-supervised fashion purely on random noise images\ntransfers well to natural home images. The learned representation can then be\nbootstrapped to learn a navigation policy efficiently with little interaction\ndata. Code is available at https://github.com/yanweiw/noise2ptz.",

Results: It is not rare in\nindustrial SE projects that communication is not just a tool or technique to be\napplied but also represents a resource, which, when lacking, threatens project\nsuccess. This situation might arise when a person required to make decisions\n(especially regarding requirements, budgets, or priorities) is often\nunavailable. It may be helpful to frame communication as a scarce resource to\nunderstand the key difficulty of such situations.

    "abstract": "The promise of multimodal models for real-world applications has inspired\nresearch in visualizing and understanding their internal mechanics with the end\ngoal of empowering stakeholders to visualize model behavior, perform model\ndebugging, and promote trust in machine learning models. However, modern\nmultimodal models are typically black-box neural networks, which makes it\nchallenging to understand their internal mechanics. How can we visualize the\ninternal modeling of multimodal interactions in these models? Our paper aims to\nfill this gap by proposing MultiViz, a method for analyzing the behavior of\nmultimodal models by scaffolding the problem of interpretability into 4 stages:\n(1) unimodal importance: how each modality contributes towards downstream\nmodeling and prediction, (2) cross-modal interactions: how different modalities\nrelate with each other, (3) multimodal representations: how unimodal and\ncross-modal interactions are represented in decision-level features, and (4)\nmultimodal prediction: how decision-level features are composed to make a\nprediction. MultiViz is designed to operate on diverse modalities, models,\ntasks, and research areas. Through experiments on 8 trained models across 6\nreal-world tasks, we show that the complementary stages in MultiViz together\nenable users to (1) simulate model predictions, (2) assign interpretable\nconcepts to features, (3) perform error analysis on model misclassifications,\nand (4) use insights from error analysis to debug models. MultiViz is publicly\navailable, will be regularly updated with new interpretation tools and metrics,\nand welcomes inputs from the community.",

We developed a bi-directional\nLong Short Term Memory (LSTM) Network that is able to use readily available\ninsurance data (inpatient visits, outpatient visits, and drug prescriptions) to\npredict 30 day re-admission for any admitted patient, regardless of reason. The\ntop-performing model achieved an ROC AUC of 0.763 (0.011) when using\nhistorical, inpatient, and post-discharge data. The LSTM model significantly\noutperformed a baseline random forest classifier, indicating that understanding\nthe sequence of events is important for model prediction. Incorporation of\n30-days of historical data also significantly improved model performance\ncompared to inpatient data alone, indicating that a patients clinical history\nprior to admission, including outpatient visits and pharmacy data is a strong\ncontributor to readmission. Our results demonstrate that a machine learning\nmodel is able to predict risk of inpatient readmission with reasonable accuracy\nfor all patients using structured insurance billing data. Because billing data\nor equivalent surrogates can be extracted from sites, such a model could be\ndeployed to identify patients at risk for readmission before they are\ndischarged, or to assign more robust follow up (closer follow up, home health,\nmailed medications) to at-risk patients after discharge.",

So many studies have been conducted,\nespecially for semantic segmentation due to its high annotation cost. The\nexisting studies stick to the basic assumption that no labeled sample is\navailable for the new domain. However, this assumption has several issues.\nFirst, it is pretty unrealistic, considering the standard practice of ML to\nconfirm the model's performance before its deployment; the confirmation needs\nlabeled data. Second, any UDA method will have a few hyper-parameters, needing\na certain amount of labeled data. To rectify this misalignment with reality, we\nrethink UDA from a data-centric point of view. Specifically, we start with the\nassumption that we do have access to a minimum level of labeled data. Then, we\nask how many labeled samples are necessary for finding satisfactory\nhyper-parameters of existing UDA methods. How well does it work if we use the\nsame data to train the model, e.g., finetuning? We conduct experiments to\nanswer these questions with popular scenarios, {GTA5,\nSYNTHIA}$\\rightarrow$Cityscapes.

The data holders want to train or infer with\nprivate data while exploiting accelerators, such as GPUs, that are hosted in\nthe cloud. Cloud systems are vulnerable to attackers that compromise the\nprivacy of data and integrity of computations. Tackling such a challenge\nrequires unifying theoretical privacy algorithms with hardware security\ncapabilities. This paper presents DarKnight, a framework for large DNN training\nwhile protecting input privacy and computation integrity. DarKnight relies on\ncooperative execution between trusted execution environments (TEE) and\naccelerators, where the TEE provides privacy and integrity verification, while\naccelerators perform the bulk of the linear algebraic computation to optimize\nthe performance. In particular, DarKnight uses a customized data encoding\nstrategy based on matrix masking to create input obfuscation within a TEE. The\nobfuscated data is then offloaded to GPUs for fast linear algebraic\ncomputation. DarKnight's data obfuscation strategy provides provable data\nprivacy and computation integrity in the cloud servers. While prior works\ntackle inference privacy and cannot be utilized for training, DarKnight's\nencoding scheme is designed to support both training and inference.",

To this end, we\npropose Vector-Quantized Variational Information Bottleneck (VQ-VIB), a method\nfor training neural agents to compress inputs into discrete signals embedded in\na continuous space.

In\nthis paper, we push forward in the study of number of quantifiers as a bona\nfide complexity measure by establishing several new results.

Based on our\ndeep learning classifier developed to detect hateful videos and a large-scale\ndataset of over 350K videos, we find that Arabic videos targeting religious\nminorities are particularly prevalent in search results (30%) and first-level\nrecommendations (21%), and that 15% of overall captured recommendations point\nto hateful videos. Our personalized audit experiments suggest that gender and\nreligious identity can substantially affect the extent of exposure to hateful\ncontent. Our results contribute vital insights into the phenomenon of online\nradicalization and facilitate curbing online harmful content.",

    "abstract": "Factorizing a large matrix into small matrices is a popular strategy for\nmodel compression. Singular value decomposition (SVD) plays a vital role in\nthis compression strategy, approximating a learned matrix with fewer\nparameters. However, SVD minimizes the squared error toward reconstructing the\noriginal matrix without gauging the importance of the parameters, potentially\ngiving a larger reconstruction error for those who affect the task accuracy\nmore. In other words, the optimization objective of SVD is not aligned with the\ntrained model's task accuracy. We analyze this previously unexplored problem,\nmake observations, and address it by introducing Fisher information to weigh\nthe importance of parameters affecting the model prediction. This idea leads to\nour method: Fisher-Weighted SVD (FWSVD). Although the factorized matrices from\nour approach do not result in smaller reconstruction errors, we find that our\nresulting task accuracy is much closer to the original model's performance. We\nperform analysis with the transformer-based language models, showing our\nweighted SVD largely alleviates the mismatched optimization objectives and can\nmaintain model performance with a higher compression rate. Our method can\ndirectly compress a task-specific model while achieving better performance than\nother compact model strategies requiring expensive model pre-training.\nMoreover, the evaluation of compressing an already compact model shows our\nmethod can further reduce 9% to 30% parameters with an insignificant impact on\ntask accuracy.",

These\nlead to inference delay and limit the captioning model to deploy in real-time\nrobotic surgery. For this purpose, we design an end-to-end detector and feature\nextractor-free captioning model by utilizing the patch-based shifted window\ntechnique. We propose Shifted Window-Based Multi-Layer Perceptrons Transformer\nCaptioning model (SwinMLP-TranCAP) with faster inference speed and less\ncomputation. SwinMLP-TranCAP replaces the multi-head attention module with\nwindow-based multi-head MLP. Such deployments primarily focus on image\nunderstanding tasks, but very few works investigate the caption generation\ntask. SwinMLP-TranCAP is also extended into a video version for video\ncaptioning tasks using 3D patches and windows.

    "abstract": "To train robust deep neural networks (DNNs), we systematically study several\ntarget modification approaches, which include output regularisation, self and\nnon-self label correction (LC). Three key issues are discovered: (1) Self LC is\nthe most appealing as it exploits its own knowledge and requires no extra\nmodels. However, how to automatically decide the trust degree of a learner as\ntraining goes is not well answered in the literature. (2) Some methods penalise\nwhile the others reward low-entropy predictions, prompting us to ask which one\nis better. (3) Using the standard training setting, a trained network is of low\nconfidence when severe noise exists, making it hard to leverage its\nhigh-entropy self knowledge.\nTo resolve the issue (1), taking two well-accepted propositions--deep neural\nnetworks learn meaningful patterns before fitting noise and minimum entropy\nregularisation principle--we propose a novel end-to-end method named ProSelfLC,\nwhich is designed according to learning time and entropy. Specifically, given a\ndata point, we progressively increase trust in its predicted label distribution\nversus its annotated one if a model has been trained for enough time and the\nprediction is of low entropy (high confidence). For the issue (2), according to\nProSelfLC, we empirically prove that it is better to redefine a meaningful\nlow-entropy status and optimise the learner toward it. This serves as a defence\nof entropy minimisation. To address the issue (3), we decrease the entropy of\nself knowledge using a low temperature before exploiting it to correct labels,\nso that the revised labels redefine a low-entropy target state.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of ProSelfLC through extensive experiments\nin both clean and noisy settings, and on both image and protein datasets.\nFurthermore, our source code is available at\nhttps://github.com/XinshaoAmosWang/ProSelfLC-AT.",

    "abstract": "Smart grid (SG) systems enhance grid resilience and efficient operation,\nleveraging the bidirectional flow of energy and information between generation\nfacilities and prosumers. For energy demand management (EDM), the SG network\nrequires computing a large amount of data generated by massive\nInternet-of-things (IoT) sensors and advanced metering infrastructure (AMI)\nwith minimal latency. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning\n(DRL)-based resource allocation scheme in a 6G-enabled SG edge network to\noffload resource-consuming EDM computation to edge servers. Automatic resource\nprovisioning is achieved by harnessing the computational capabilities of smart\nmeters in the dynamic edge network. To enforce DRL-assisted policies in dense\n6G networks, the state information from multiple edge servers is required.\nHowever, adversaries can 'poison' such information through false state\ninjection (FSI) attacks, exhausting SG edge computing resources. Toward\naddressing this issue, we investigate the impact of such FSI attacks with\nrespect to abusive utilization of edge resources, and develop a lightweight FSI\ndetection mechanism based on supervised classifiers. Simulation results\ndemonstrate the efficacy of DRL in dynamic resource allocation, the impact of\nthe FSI attacks, and the effectiveness of the detection technique.",

    "abstract": "Low latency and reliable information transfer are highly demanded in 5G and\nbeyond 5G wireless communications. However, the conventional media access\ncontrol (MAC) protocol for local wireless networks sometimes unexpectedly\nyields significant delays due to its stochastic arbitration mechanism,\nresulting in the incapability of limiting the maximum delay. In the meantime,\nthe latest precise time synchronization technology, especially wireless two-way\ninterferometry (Wi-Wi), paves a new way to overcome such fundamental\ndifficulties. Indeed, Yamasaki et al. proposed a new delay-bounded wireless MAC\nprotocol named Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Arbitration Point (CSMA/AP),\nexploiting precise time synchronization among all devices in the network.\nCSMA/AP enables collision-free and delay-bounded communications with a simple\nautonomous arbitration mechanism, unlike conventional methods such as CSMA/CA.\nThe former study, however, was limited only to numerical examinations.\nExperimental demonstration and verification in wireless environments are one of\nthe most critical steps. This paper experimentally demonstrates the fundamental\nprinciples of CSMA/AP by constructing a star-topology wireless network using\nsoftware-defined radio terminals combined with precise time synchronization\ndevices. We show that CSMA/AP is successfully operated, including the dynamic\nchange of the spatial position of the terminal or the capability to accommodate\nmobility, thanks to the real-time adaption to the dynamically changing\nenvironment by Wi-Wi. We also experimentally confirm that the proposed CSMA/AP\nprinciple cannot be executed without Wi-Wi, which validates the impact of\nprecise time synchronization. This study paves a way toward realizing\ndelay-bounded wireless communications for future low-latency and highly\nreliable critical applications.",

    "abstract": "Large pretrained models can be privately fine-tuned to achieve performance\napproaching that of non-private models. A common theme in these results is the\nsurprising observation that high-dimensional models can achieve favorable\nprivacy-utility trade-offs. This seemingly contradicts known results on the\nmodel-size dependence of differentially private convex learning and raises the\nfollowing research question: When does the performance of differentially\nprivate learning not degrade with increasing model size? We identify that the\nmagnitudes of gradients projected onto subspaces is a key factor that\ndetermines performance. To precisely characterize this for private convex\nlearning, we introduce a condition on the objective that we term restricted\nLipschitz continuity and derive improved bounds for the excess empirical and\npopulation risks that are dimension-independent under additional conditions. We\nempirically show that in private fine-tuning of large language models,\ngradients evaluated near a local optimum are mostly controlled by a few\nprincipal components. This behavior is similar to conditions under which we\nobtain dimension-independent bounds in convex settings. Our theoretical and\nempirical results together provide a possible explanation for recent successes\nin large-scale private fine-tuning.",

    "abstract": "Computational optical imaging (COI) systems leverage optical coding elements\n(CE) in their setups to encode a high-dimensional scene in a single or multiple\nsnapshots and decode it by using computational algorithms. The performance of\nCOI systems highly depends on the design of its main components: the CE pattern\nand the computational method used to perform a given task. Conventional\napproaches rely on random patterns or analytical designs to set the\ndistribution of the CE. However, the available data and algorithm capabilities\nof deep neural networks (DNNs) have opened a new horizon in CE data-driven\ndesigns that jointly consider the optical encoder and computational decoder.\nSpecifically, by modeling the COI measurements through a fully differentiable\nimage formation model that considers the physics-based propagation of light and\nits interaction with the CEs, the parameters that define the CE and the\ncomputational decoder can be optimized in an end-to-end (E2E) manner. Moreover,\nby optimizing just CEs in the same framework, inference tasks can be performed\nfrom pure optics. This work surveys the recent advances on CE data-driven\ndesign and provides guidelines on how to parametrize different optical elements\nto include them in the E2E framework. Since the E2E framework can handle\ndifferent inference applications by changing the loss function and the DNN, we\npresent low-level tasks such as spectral imaging reconstruction or high-level\ntasks such as pose estimation with privacy preserving enhanced by using optimal\ntask-based optical architectures.

    "abstract": "Vertical federated learning (VFL) is attracting much attention because it\nenables cross-silo data cooperation in a privacy-preserving manner. While most\nresearch works in VFL focus on linear and tree models, deep models (e.g.,\nneural networks) are not well studied in VFL. In this paper, we focus on\nSplitNN, a well-known neural network framework in VFL, and identify a trade-off\nbetween data security and model performance in SplitNN. Briefly, SplitNN trains\nthe model by exchanging gradients and transformed data. On the one hand,\nSplitNN suffers from the loss of model performance since multiply parties\njointly train the model using transformed data instead of raw data, and a large\namount of low-level feature information is discarded. On the other hand, a\nnaive solution of increasing the model performance through aggregating at lower\nlayers in SplitNN (i.e., the data is less transformed and more low-level\nfeature is preserved) makes raw data vulnerable to inference attacks. To\nmitigate the above trade-off, we propose a new neural network protocol in VFL\ncalled Security Forward Aggregation (SFA). It changes the way of aggregating\nthe transformed data and adopts removable masks to protect the raw data.\nExperiment results show that networks with SFA achieve both data security and\nhigh model performance.",

However, there is a domain gap between the synthetic data and real\ndata, which limits the performance of the text recognition models. Recent\nself-supervised text recognition methods attempted to utilize unlabeled real\nimages by introducing contrastive learning, which mainly learns the\ndiscrimination of the text images. Inspired by the observation that humans\nlearn to recognize the texts through both reading and writing, we propose to\nlearn discrimination and generation by integrating contrastive learning and\nmasked image modeling in our self-supervised method. The contrastive learning\nbranch is adopted to learn the discrimination of text images, which imitates\nthe reading behavior of humans. Meanwhile, masked image modeling is firstly\nintroduced for text recognition to learn the context generation of the text\nimages, which is similar to the writing behavior. The experimental results show\nthat our method outperforms previous self-supervised text recognition methods\nby 10.2%-20.2% on irregular scene text recognition datasets. Moreover, our\nproposed text recognizer exceeds previous state-of-the-art text recognition\nmethods by averagely 5.3% on 11 benchmarks, with similar model size.

    "title": "VL-CheckList: Evaluating Pre-trained Vision-Language Models with  Objects, Attributes and Relations",
    "abstract": "Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) models have recently successfully\nfacilitated many cross-modal downstream tasks. Most existing works evaluated\ntheir systems by comparing the fine-tuned downstream task performance. However,\nonly average downstream task accuracy provides little information about the\npros and cons of each VLP method, let alone provides insights on how the\ncommunity can improve the systems in the future. Inspired by the CheckList for\ntesting natural language processing, we introduce VL-CheckList, a novel\nframework to understand the capabilities of VLP models. The proposed method\ndivides the image-texting ability of a VLP model into three categories:\nobjects, attributes, and relations, and uses a novel taxonomy to further break\ndown these three aspects. We conduct comprehensive studies to analyze seven\nrecently popular VLP models via the proposed framework. Results confirm the\neffectiveness of the proposed method by revealing fine-grained differences\namong the compared models that were not visible from downstream task-only\nevaluation. Further results show promising research direction in building\nbetter VLP models. Data and Code: https://github.com/om-ai-lab/VL-CheckList",

    "abstract": "Randomised field experiments, such as A/B testing, have long been the gold\nstandard for evaluating software changes. In the automotive domain, running\nrandomised field experiments is not always desired, possible, or even ethical.\nIn the face of such limitations, we develop a framework BOAT (Bayesian causal\nmodelling for ObvservAtional Testing), utilising observational studies in\ncombination with Bayesian causal inference, in order to understand real-world\nimpacts from complex automotive software updates and help software development\norganisations arrive at causal conclusions. In this study, we present three\ncausal inference models in the Bayesian framework and their corresponding cases\nto address three commonly experienced challenges of software evaluation in the\nautomotive domain. We develop the BOAT framework with our industry\ncollaborator, and demonstrate the potential of causal inference by conducting\nempirical studies on a large fleet of vehicles. Moreover, we relate the causal\nassumption theories to their implications in practise, aiming to provide a\ncomprehensive guide on how to apply the causal models in automotive software\nengineering. We apply Bayesian propensity score matching for producing balanced\ncontrol and treatment groups when we do not have access to the entire user\nbase, Bayesian regression discontinuity design for identifying covariate\ndependent treatment assignments and the local treatment effect, and Bayesian\ndifference-in-differences for causal inference of treatment effect overtime and\nimplicitly control unobserved confounding factors. Each one of the\ndemonstrative case has its grounds in practise, and is a scenario experienced\nwhen randomisation is not feasible. With the BOAT framework, we enable online\nsoftware evaluation in the automotive domain without the need of a fully\nrandomised experiment.",

    "abstract": "When adapting Simultaneous Mapping and Localization (SLAM) to real-world\napplications, such as autonomous vehicles, drones, and augmented reality\ndevices, its memory footprint and computing cost are the two main factors\nlimiting the performance and the range of applications. In sparse feature based\nSLAM algorithms, one efficient way for this problem is to limit the map point\nsize by selecting the points potentially useful for local and global bundle\nadjustment (BA). This study proposes an efficient graph optimization for\nsparsifying map points in SLAM systems. Specifically, we formulate a maximum\npose-visibility and maximum spatial diversity problem as a minimum-cost\nmaximum-flow graph optimization problem. The proposed method works as an\nadditional step in existing SLAM systems, so it can be used in both\nconventional or learning based SLAM systems. By extensive experimental\nevaluations we demonstrate the proposed method achieves even more accurate\ncamera poses with approximately 1/3 of the map points and 1/2 of the\ncomputation.",

    "abstract": "This article seeks for a distributed learning solution for the visual\ntransformer (ViT) architectures. Compared to convolutional neural network (CNN)\narchitectures, ViTs often have larger model sizes, and are computationally\nexpensive, making federated learning (FL) ill-suited. Split learning (SL) can\ndetour this problem by splitting a model and communicating the hidden\nrepresentations at the split-layer, also known as smashed data.\nNotwithstanding, the smashed data of ViT are as large as and as similar as the\ninput data, negating the communication efficiency of SL while violating data\nprivacy. To resolve these issues, we propose a new form of CutSmashed data by\nrandomly punching and compressing the original smashed data. Leveraging this,\nwe develop a novel SL framework for ViT, coined CutMixSL, communicating\nCutSmashed data. CutMixSL not only reduces communication costs and privacy\nleakage, but also inherently involves the CutMix data augmentation, improving\naccuracy and scalability. Simulations corroborate that CutMixSL outperforms\nbaselines such as parallelized SL and SplitFed that integrates FL with SL.",

    "abstract": "While deep learning based speech enhancement systems have made rapid progress\nin improving the quality of speech signals, they can still produce outputs that\ncontain artifacts and can sound unnatural. We propose a novel approach to\nspeech enhancement aimed at improving perceptual quality and naturalness of\nenhanced signals by optimizing for key characteristics of speech. We first\nidentify key acoustic parameters that have been found to correlate well with\nvoice quality (e.g. jitter, shimmer, and spectral flux) and then propose\nobjective functions which are aimed at reducing the difference between clean\nspeech and enhanced speech with respect to these features. The full set of\nacoustic features is the extended Geneva Acoustic Parameter Set (eGeMAPS),\nwhich includes 25 different attributes associated with perception of speech.\nGiven the non-differentiable nature of these feature computation, we first\nbuild differentiable estimators of the eGeMAPS and then use them to fine-tune\nexisting speech enhancement systems. Our approach is generic and can be applied\nto any existing deep learning based enhancement systems to further improve the\nenhanced speech signals. Experimental results conducted on the Deep Noise\nSuppression (DNS) Challenge dataset shows that our approach can improve the\nstate-of-the-art deep learning based enhancement systems.",

DMIL adopts a novel cooperative-yet-adversarial learning\nstrategy, which uses the discriminator to guide and couple the learning process\nof the policy and dynamics model, resulting in improved model performance and\nrobustness.

Weakly\nsupervised learning (WSL), which leverages coarse-grained labels to accomplish\nfine-grained tasks, has the potential to solve this problem. In this paper, we\nfirst propose a new large-scale tuberculosis (TB) chest X-ray dataset, namely\nthe tuberculosis chest X-ray attribute dataset (TBX-Att), and then establish an\nattribute-assisted weakly-supervised framework to classify and localize TB by\nleveraging the attribute information to overcome the insufficiency of\nsupervision in WSL scenarios.

It also includes the public\nTBX11K dataset with 11200 X-ray images to facilitate weakly supervised\ndetection. Second, we exploit a multi-scale feature interaction model for TB\narea classification and detection with attribute relational reasoning. The\nproposed model is evaluated on the TBX-Att dataset and will serve as a solid\nbaseline for future research.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a gaze correction and animation method for\nhigh-resolution, unconstrained portrait images, which can be trained without\nthe gaze angle and the head pose annotations. Common gaze-correction methods\nusually require annotating training data with precise gaze, and head pose\ninformation. Solving this problem using an unsupervised method remains an open\nproblem, especially for high-resolution face images in the wild, which are not\neasy to annotate with gaze and head pose labels. To address this issue, we\nfirst create two new portrait datasets: CelebGaze and high-resolution\nCelebHQGaze. Second, we formulate the gaze correction task as an image\ninpainting problem, addressed using a Gaze Correction Module (GCM) and a Gaze\nAnimation Module (GAM). Moreover, we propose an unsupervised training strategy,\ni.e., Synthesis-As-Training, to learn the correlation between the eye region\nfeatures and the gaze angle. As a result, we can use the learned latent space\nfor gaze animation with semantic interpolation in this space. Moreover, to\nalleviate both the memory and the computational costs in the training and the\ninference stage, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine Module (CFM) integrated with GCM\nand GAM. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method for\nboth the gaze correction and the gaze animation tasks in both low and\nhigh-resolution face datasets in the wild and demonstrate the superiority of\nour method with respect to the state of the arts.

    "abstract": "A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a deep-learning generative model in\nthe field of Machine Learning (ML) that involves training two Neural Networks\n(NN) using a sizable data set. In certain fields, such as medicine, the\ntraining data may be hospital patient records that are stored across different\nhospitals. The classic centralized approach would involve sending the data to a\ncentralized server where the model would be trained. However, that would\ninvolve breaching the privacy and confidentiality of the patients and their\ndata, which would be unacceptable. Therefore, Federated Learning (FL), an ML\ntechnique that trains ML models in a distributed setting without data ever\nleaving the host device, would be a better alternative to the centralized\noption. In this ML technique, only parameters and certain metadata would be\ncommunicated. In spite of that, there still exist attacks that can infer user\ndata using the parameters and metadata. A fully privacy-preserving solution\ninvolves homomorphically encrypting (HE) the data communicated. This paper will\nfocus on the performance loss of training an FL-GAN with three different types\nof Homomorphic Encryption: Partial Homomorphic Encryption (PHE), Somewhat\nHomomorphic Encryption (SHE), and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).

    "abstract": "Future industrial applications will encompass compelling new use cases\nrequiring stringent performance guarantees over multiple key performance\nindicators (KPI) such as reliability, dependability, latency, time\nsynchronization, security, etc. Achieving such stringent and diverse service\nrequirements necessitates the design of a special-purpose Industrial Internet\nof Things (IIoT) network comprising a multitude of specialized functionalities\nand technological enablers. This article proposes an innovative architecture\nfor such a special-purpose 6G IIoT network incorporating seven functional\nbuilding blocks categorized into: special-purpose functionalities and enabling\ntechnologies. The former consists of Wireless Environment Control,\nTraffic/Channel Prediction, Proactive Resource Management and End-to-End\nOptimization functions; whereas the latter includes Synchronization and\nCoordination, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Algorithms, and\nAuxiliary Functions. The proposed architecture aims at providing a\nresource-efficient and holistic solution for the complex and dynamically\nchallenging requirements imposed by future 6G industrial use cases. Selected\ntest scenarios are provided and assessed to illustrate cross-functional\ncollaboration and demonstrate the applicability of the proposed architecture in\na wireless IIoT network.",

At the transmitter side, each user is assigned a unique protocol\nsequence which is used to identify the user and also indicate the user's\nchannel access pattern. Hence, user identification is completed by the\ndetection of channel access patterns. Particularly, the columns of a parity\ncheck matrix of low-density-parity-check (LDPC) code are employed as protocol\nsequences. The design guideline of this LDPC parity check matrix and the\nassociated performance analysis are provided in this paper.At the receiver\nside, a two-stage iterative detection architecture is designed, which consists\nof a group testing component and a payload data decoding component. They\ncollaborate in a way that the group testing component maps detected protocol\nsequences to a tanner graph, on which the second component could execute its\nmessage passing algorithm. In turn, zero symbols detected by the message\npassing algorithm of the second component indicate potential false alarms made\nby the first group testing component.

    "abstract": "Due to its powerful feature learning capability and high efficiency, deep\nhashing has achieved great success in large-scale image retrieval. Meanwhile,\nextensive works have demonstrated that deep neural networks (DNNs) are\nsusceptible to adversarial examples, and exploring adversarial attack against\ndeep hashing has attracted many research efforts. Nevertheless, backdoor\nattack, another famous threat to DNNs, has not been studied for deep hashing\nyet. Although various backdoor attacks have been proposed in the field of image\nclassification, existing approaches failed to realize a truly imperceptive\nbackdoor attack that enjoys invisible triggers and clean label setting\nsimultaneously, and they also cannot meet the intrinsic demand of image\nretrieval backdoor.\nIn this paper, we propose BadHash, the first generative-based imperceptible\nbackdoor attack against deep hashing, which can effectively generate invisible\nand input-specific poisoned images with clean label. Specifically, we first\npropose a new conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) pipeline to\neffectively generate poisoned samples. For any given benign image, it seeks to\ngenerate a natural-looking poisoned counterpart with a unique invisible\ntrigger. In order to improve the attack effectiveness, we introduce a\nlabel-based contrastive learning network LabCLN to exploit the semantic\ncharacteristics of different labels, which are subsequently used for confusing\nand misleading the target model to learn the embedded trigger. We finally\nexplore the mechanism of backdoor attacks on image retrieval in the hash space.\nExtensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets verify that BadHash can\ngenerate imperceptible poisoned samples with strong attack ability and\ntransferability over state-of-the-art deep hashing schemes.

    "abstract": "Cross-modal representation learning has become a new normal for bridging the\nsemantic gap between text and visual data. Learning modality agnostic\nrepresentations in a continuous latent space, however, is often treated as a\nblack-box data-driven training process. It is well-known that the effectiveness\nof representation learning depends heavily on the quality and scale of training\ndata. For video representation learning, having a complete set of labels that\nannotate the full spectrum of video content for training is highly difficult if\nnot impossible. These issues, black-box training and dataset bias, make\nrepresentation learning practically challenging to be deployed for video\nunderstanding due to unexplainable and unpredictable results. In this paper, we\npropose two novel training objectives, likelihood and unlikelihood functions,\nto unroll semantics behind embeddings while addressing the label sparsity\nproblem in training. The likelihood training aims to interpret semantics of\nembeddings beyond training labels, while the unlikelihood training leverages\nprior knowledge for regularization to ensure semantically coherent\ninterpretation. With both training objectives, a new encoder-decoder network,\nwhich learns interpretable cross-modal representation, is proposed for ad-hoc\nvideo search.

To achieve this goal, we abandon the widely-used\nconvolution network giving its limitation in exploring diverse visual patterns,\nand resort to fully attention based framework for robust representation\nlearning motivated by the success of Transformer. Besides applying Transformer\nfor global feature extraction, we devise a local branch composed of\nwindow-based multi-head attention and spatial attention to fully exploit local\nimage patterns. Furthermore, we propose to combine the hierarchical local and\nglobal features via a cross-attention module, instead of using heuristically\nfusion as previous art does.

To\naddress these shortcomings, we present a comparative study of graph matching\nalgorithms.

The study is designed to be reproducible and\nextensible to serve as a valuable resource in the future.\nOur study provides three notable insights:\n1.) popular problem instances are exactly solvable in substantially less than\n1 second and, therefore, are insufficient for future empirical evaluations;\n2.) the most popular baseline methods are highly inferior to the best\navailable methods;\n3.) despite the NP-hardness of the problem, instances coming from vision\napplications are often solvable in a few seconds even for graphs with more than\n500 vertices.",

    "abstract": "Real bug fixes found in open source repositories seem to be the perfect\nsource for learning to localize and repair real bugs. However, the absence of\nlarge scale bug fix collections has made it difficult to effectively exploit\nreal bug fixes in the training of larger neural models in the past. In\ncontrast, artificial bugs -- produced by mutating existing source code -- can\nbe easily obtained at a sufficient scale and are therefore often preferred in\nthe training of existing approaches. Still, localization and repair models that\nare trained on artificial bugs usually underperform when faced with real bugs.\nThis raises the question whether bug localization and repair models trained on\nreal bug fixes are more effective in localizing and repairing real bugs.\nWe address this question by introducing RealiT, a pre-train-and-fine-tune\napproach for effectively learning to localize and repair real bugs from real\nbug fixes. RealiT is first pre-trained on a large number of artificial bugs\nproduced by traditional mutation operators and then fine-tuned on a smaller set\nof real bug fixes. Fine-tuning does not require any modifications of the\nlearning algorithm and hence can be easily adopted in various training\nscenarios for bug localization or repair (even when real training data is\nscarce). In addition, we found that training on real bug fixes with RealiT is\nempirically powerful by nearly doubling the localization performance of an\nexisting model on real bugs while maintaining or even improving the repair\nperformance.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we propose an approach to the design of processes and software\nthat aims at decreasing human and software errors, that so frequently happen,\nmaking affected people using and wasting a lot of time for the need of fixing\nthe errors. We base our statements on the natural relationship between quality\nand error rate, increasing the latter as the error rate decreases. We try to\nclassify errors into several types and address techniques to reduce the\nlikelihood of making mistakes, depending on the type of error.\nWe focus on this approach related to organization, management and software\ndesign that will allow to be more effective and efficient in this period where\nmankind has been affected by a severe pandemic and where we need to be more\nefficient and effective in all processes, aiming at an industrial renaissance\nwhich we know to be not too far and easily reachable once the path to follow\nhas been characterized, also in the light of the experience.",

    "title": "A Note on Process Modelling: Combining Situation Calculus and Petri Nets",
    "abstract": "The situation calculus logic model is convenient for modelling the actions\nthat can occur in an information system application. The interplay of\npre-conditions and post-conditions determines a semantically justified partial\norder of the defined actions and serves to enforce integrity constraints. This\nform of specification allows the use of plan-generation algorithms to\ninvestigate, before the system is adopted, whether the proposed specification\nallows all desirable use cases, and effectively disallows undesirable ones.\nEspecially for legacy applications, implemented without a prior specification,\nProcess Mining techniques were employed to derive an implicit Petri net model\nfrom the analysis of a large number of traces registered in an execution log.\nHowever, if the system just begins to be used, and has a still empty execution\nlog, this sort of process mining discovery would not be feasible. This paper\nexplains how the Petri net model can be directly derived from the situation\ncalculus specification rules. The main gist is to provide evidence that the two\nmodels are complementary, not only because the Petri net model is derivable\nfrom the situation calculus model, but also in view of the distinct advantages\nof the two models. While the situation calculus model leads to planning and\nsimulated execution prior to implementation, the Petri net model can be\ndesigned to run in a restrictive mode, allowing an intuitive visualization of\nthe workable sequences. As proof of concept, the paper describes a prototype to\ndemonstrate the methods and applies it to two examples: a published request\nprocessing application used to introduce process mining notions; and an\nanalogously structured trial by combat application taken from a popular movie.\nThe prototype includes an interactive dramatization component, which enacts the\nsecond application.",

    "title": "SDRTV-to-HDRTV via Hierarchical Dynamic Context Feature Mapping",
    "abstract": "In this work, we address the task of SDR videos to HDR\nvideos(SDRTV-to-HDRTV). Previous approaches use global feature modulation for\nSDRTV-to-HDRTV. Feature modulation scales and shifts the features in the\noriginal feature space, which has limited mapping capability. In addition, the\nglobal image mapping cannot restore detail in HDR frames due to the luminance\ndifferences in different regions of SDR frames. To resolve the appeal, we\npropose a two-stage solution. The first stage is a hierarchical Dynamic Context\nfeature mapping (HDCFM) model. HDCFM learns the SDR frame to HDR frame mapping\nfunction via hierarchical feature modulation (HME and HM ) module and a dynamic\ncontext feature transformation (DCT) module. The HME estimates the feature\nmodulation vector, HM is capable of hierarchical feature modulation, consisting\nof global feature modulation in series with local feature modulation, and is\ncapable of adaptive mapping of local image features. The DCT module constructs\na feature transformation module in conjunction with the context, which is\ncapable of adaptively generating a feature transformation matrix for feature\nmapping. Compared with simple feature scaling and shifting, the DCT module can\nmap features into a new feature space and thus has a more excellent feature\nmapping capability. In the second stage, we introduce a patch\ndiscriminator-based context generation model PDCG to obtain subjective quality\nenhancement of over-exposed regions. PDCG can solve the problem that the model\nis challenging to train due to the proportion of overexposed regions of the\nimage. The proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art objective and\nsubjective quality results. Specifically, HDCFM achieves a PSNR gain of 0.81 dB\nat a parameter of about 100K. The number of parameters is 1/14th of the\nprevious state-of-the-art methods. The test code will be released soon.",

Moreover, these methods learn features without\nreasoning about objects, shapes inside images, thus lacks of interpretability.\nIn this paper, we propose an architecture for image matching which is\nefficient, robust, and interpretable. More specifically, we introduce a novel\nfeature matching module called TopicFM which can roughly organize same spatial\nstructure across images into a topic and then augment the features inside each\ntopic for accurate matching. To infer topics, we first learn global embedding\nof topics and then use a latent-variable model to detect-then-assign the image\nstructures into topics.

    "abstract": "We introduce a new automatic evaluation method for speaker similarity\nassessment, that is consistent with human perceptual scores. Modern neural\ntext-to-speech models require a vast amount of clean training data, which is\nwhy many solutions switch from single speaker models to solutions trained on\nexamples from many different speakers. Multi-speaker models bring new\npossibilities, such as a faster creation of new voices, but also a new problem\n- speaker leakage, where the speaker identity of a synthesized example might\nnot match those of the target speaker. Currently, the only way to discover this\nissue is through costly perceptual evaluations. In this work, we propose an\nautomatic method for assessment of speaker similarity. For that purpose, we\nextend the recent work on speaker verification systems and evaluate how\ndifferent metrics and speaker embeddings models reflect Multiple Stimuli with\nHidden Reference and Anchor (MUSHRA) scores.

    "title": "Fine-grained Correlation Loss for Regression",
    "abstract": "Regression learning is classic and fundamental for medical image analysis. It\nprovides the continuous mapping for many critical applications, like the\nattribute estimation, object detection, segmentation and non-rigid\nregistration. However, previous studies mainly took the case-wise criteria,\nlike the mean square errors, as the optimization objectives. They ignored the\nvery important population-wise correlation criterion, which is exactly the\nfinal evaluation metric in many tasks. In this work, we propose to revisit the\nclassic regression tasks with novel investigations on directly optimizing the\nfine-grained correlation losses. We mainly explore two complementary\ncorrelation indexes as learnable losses: Pearson linear correlation (PLC) and\nSpearman rank correlation (SRC). The contributions of this paper are two folds.\nFirst, for the PLC on global level, we propose a strategy to make it robust\nagainst the outliers and regularize the key distribution factors. These efforts\nsignificantly stabilize the learning and magnify the efficacy of PLC. Second,\nfor the SRC on local level, we propose a coarse-to-fine scheme to ease the\nlearning of the exact ranking order among samples. Specifically, we convert the\nlearning for the ranking of samples into the learning of similarity\nrelationships among samples. We extensively validate our method on two typical\nultrasound image regression tasks, including the image quality assessment and\nbio-metric measurement. Experiments prove that, with the fine-grained guidance\nin directly optimizing the correlation, the regression performances are\nsignificantly improved. Our proposed correlation losses are general and can be\nextended to more important applications.",

    "abstract": "Recommender systems are used in many different applications and contexts,\nhowever their main goal can always be summarised as \"connecting relevant\ncontent to interested users\". Personalized recommendation algorithms achieve\nthis goal by first building a profile of the user, either implicitly or\nexplicitly, and then matching items with this profile to find relevant content.\nThe more interpretable the profile and this \"matching function\" are, the easier\nit is to provide users with accurate and intuitive explanations, and also to\nlet them interact with the system. Indeed, for a user to see what the system\nhas already learned about her interests is of key importance for her to provide\nfeedback to the system and to guide it towards better understanding her\npreferences.\nTo this end, we propose a linear collaborative filtering recommendation model\nthat builds user profiles within the domain of item metadata, which is arguably\nthe most interpretable domain for end users. Our method is hence inherently\ntransparent and explainable. Moreover, since recommendations are computed as a\nlinear function of item metadata and the interpretable user profile, our method\nseamlessly supports interactive recommendation. In other words, users can\ndirectly tweak the weights of the learned profile for more fine-grained\nbrowsing and discovery of content based on their current interests.\nWe demonstrate the interactive aspect of this model in an online application\nfor discovering cultural events in Belgium. Additionally, the performance of\nthe model is evaluated with offline experiments, both static and with simulated\nfeedback, and compared to several state-of-the-art and state-of-practice\nbaselines.",

    "abstract": "Many real-world problems contain multiple objectives and agents, where a\ntrade-off exists between objectives. Key to solving such problems is to exploit\nsparse dependency structures that exist between agents. For example, in wind\nfarm control a trade-off exists between maximising power and minimising stress\non the systems components. Dependencies between turbines arise due to the wake\neffect. We model such sparse dependencies between agents as a multi-objective\ncoordination graph (MO-CoG). In multi-objective reinforcement learning a\nutility function is typically used to model a users preferences over\nobjectives, which may be unknown a priori. In such settings a set of optimal\npolicies must be computed. Which policies are optimal depends on which\noptimality criterion applies. If the utility function of a user is derived from\nmultiple executions of a policy, the scalarised expected returns (SER) must be\noptimised. If the utility of a user is derived from a single execution of a\npolicy, the expected scalarised returns (ESR) criterion must be optimised. For\nexample, wind farms are subjected to constraints and regulations that must be\nadhered to at all times, therefore the ESR criterion must be optimised. For\nMO-CoGs, the state-of-the-art algorithms can only compute a set of optimal\npolicies for the SER criterion, leaving the ESR criterion understudied. To\ncompute a set of optimal polices under the ESR criterion, also known as the ESR\nset, distributions over the returns must be maintained. Therefore, to compute a\nset of optimal policies under the ESR criterion for MO-CoGs, we present a novel\ndistributional multi-objective variable elimination (DMOVE) algorithm. We\nevaluate DMOVE in realistic wind farm simulations. Given the returns in\nreal-world wind farm settings are continuous, we utilise a model known as\nreal-NVP to learn the continuous return distributions to calculate the ESR set.",

    "title": "Adapting the Mean Teacher for keypoint-based lung registration under  geometric domain shifts",
    "abstract": "Recent deep learning-based methods for medical image registration achieve\nresults that are competitive with conventional optimization algorithms at\nreduced run times. However, deep neural networks generally require plenty of\nlabeled training data and are vulnerable to domain shifts between training and\ntest data. While typical intensity shifts can be mitigated by keypoint-based\nregistration, these methods still suffer from geometric domain shifts, for\ninstance, due to different fields of view. As a remedy, in this work, we\npresent a novel approach to geometric domain adaptation for image registration,\nadapting a model from a labeled source to an unlabeled target domain. We build\non a keypoint-based registration model, combining graph convolutions for\ngeometric feature learning with loopy belief optimization, and propose to\nreduce the domain shift through self-ensembling. To this end, we embed the\nmodel into the Mean Teacher paradigm. We extend the Mean Teacher to this\ncontext by 1) adapting the stochastic augmentation scheme and 2) combining\nlearned feature extraction with differentiable optimization. This enables us to\nguide the learning process in the unlabeled target domain by enforcing\nconsistent predictions of the learning student and the temporally averaged\nteacher model. We evaluate the method for exhale-to-inhale lung CT registration\nunder two challenging adaptation scenarios (DIR-Lab 4D CT to COPD, COPD to\nLearn2Reg). Our method consistently improves on the baseline model by 50%/47%\nwhile even matching the accuracy of models trained on target data.

    "title": "Anisotropic, Sparse and Interpretable Physics-Informed Neural Networks  for PDEs",
    "abstract": "There has been a growing interest in the use of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)\nto solve Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Despite the promise that such\napproaches hold, there are various aspects where they could be improved. Two\nsuch shortcomings are (i) their computational inefficiency relative to\nclassical numerical methods, and (ii) the non-interpretability of a trained DNN\nmodel. In this work we present ASPINN, an anisotropic extension of our earlier\nwork called SPINN--Sparse, Physics-informed, and Interpretable Neural\nNetworks--to solve PDEs that addresses both these issues. ASPINNs generalize\nradial basis function networks. We demonstrate using a variety of examples\ninvolving elliptic and hyperbolic PDEs that the special architecture we propose\nis more efficient than generic DNNs, while at the same time being directly\ninterpretable. Further, they improve upon the SPINN models we proposed earlier\nin that fewer nodes are require to capture the solution using ASPINN than using\nSPINN, thanks to the anisotropy of the local zones of influence of each node.\nThe interpretability of ASPINN translates to a ready visualization of their\nweights and biases, thereby yielding more insight into the nature of the\ntrained model. This in turn provides a systematic procedure to improve the\narchitecture based on the quality of the computed solution. ASPINNs thus serve\nas an effective bridge between classical numerical algorithms and modern DNN\nbased methods to solve PDEs. In the process, we also streamline the training of\nASPINNs into a form that is closer to that of supervised learning algorithms.",

    "abstract": "We study efficient and exact shortest path algorithms for routing on road\nnetworks with realistic traffic data. For navigation applications, both current\n(i.e., live) traffic events and predictions of future traffic flows play an\nimportant role in routing. While preprocessing-based speedup techniques have\nbeen employed successfully to both settings individually, a combined model\nposes significant challenges. Supporting predicted traffic typically requires\nexpensive preprocessing while live traffic requires fast updates for regular\nadjustments. We propose an A*-based solution to this problem. By generalizing\nA* potentials to time dependency, i.e. the estimate of the distance from a\nvertex to the target also depends on the time of day when the vertex is\nvisited, we achieve significantly faster query times than previously possible.\nOur evaluation shows that our approach enables interactive query times on\ncontinental-sized road networks while allowing live traffic updates within a\nfraction of a minute. We achieve a speedup of at least two orders of magnitude\nover Dijkstra's algorithm and up to one order of magnitude over\nstate-of-the-art time-independent A* potentials.",

While the\nnotion of kernelization, originating in parameterized complexity theory, is a\nformalization of provably effective preprocessing aimed at reducing the total\ninstance size, our focus is on finding a non-empty vertex set that belongs to\nan optimal solution. This decreases the size of the remaining part of the\nsolution which still has to be found, and therefore shrinks the search space of\nfixed-parameter tractable algorithms for parameterizations based on the\nsolution size. We introduce the notion of a c-essential vertex as one that is\ncontained in all c-approximate solutions. For several classic combinatorial\nproblems such as Odd Cycle Transversal and Directed Feedback Vertex Set, we\nshow that under mild conditions a polynomial-time preprocessing algorithm can\nfind a subset of an optimal solution that contains all 2-essential vertices, by\nexploiting packing/covering duality.

    "abstract": "The ability to convey relevant and faithful information is critical for many\ntasks in conditional generation and yet remains elusive for neural seq-to-seq\nmodels whose outputs often reveal hallucinations and fail to correctly cover\nimportant details. In this work, we advocate planning as a useful intermediate\nrepresentation for rendering conditional generation less opaque and more\ngrounded. Our work proposes a new conceptualization of text plans as a sequence\nof question-answer (QA) pairs. We enhance existing datasets (e.g., for\nsummarization) with a QA blueprint operating as a proxy for both content\nselection (i.e.,~what to say) and planning (i.e.,~in what order). We obtain\nblueprints automatically by exploiting state-of-the-art question generation\ntechnology and convert input-output pairs into input-blueprint-output tuples.\nWe develop Transformer-based models, each varying in how they incorporate the\nblueprint in the generated output (e.g., as a global plan or iteratively).\nEvaluation across metrics and datasets demonstrates that blueprint models are\nmore factual than alternatives which do not resort to planning and allow\ntighter control of the generation output.",

The development of tools to\nautomate certain tasks could alleviate the physical and mental load of doctors\nduring interventions, allowing them to focus on diagnosis and decision-making\ntasks. In this paper, we present a synergic solution for intraluminal\nnavigation consisting of a 3D printed endoscopic soft robot that can move\nsafely inside luminal structures. Visual servoing, based on Convolutional\nNeural Networks (CNNs) is used to achieve the autonomous navigation task. The\nCNN is trained with phantoms and in-vivo data to segment the lumen, and a\nmodel-less approach is presented to control the movement in constrained\nenvironments. The proposed robot is validated in anatomical phantoms in\ndifferent path configurations. We analyze the movement of the robot using\ndifferent metrics such as task completion time, smoothness, error in the\nsteady-state, and mean and maximum error.

We show that the networks\ntrained in this regime, even though they enjoy good theoretical computational\nguarantees, remain vulnerable to adversarial examples.

    "abstract": "The remarkable success of deep learning in various domains relies on the\navailability of large-scale annotated datasets. However, the use of\nhuman-generated annotations leads to models with biased learning, poor domain\ngeneralization, and poor robustness. Obtaining annotations is also expensive\nand requires great effort, which is especially challenging for videos. As an\nalternative, self-supervised learning provides a way for representation\nlearning which does not require annotations and has shown promise in both image\nand video domains. Different from the image domain, learning video\nrepresentations are more challenging due to the temporal dimension, bringing in\nmotion and other environmental dynamics. This also provides opportunities for\nexclusive ideas which can advance self-supervised learning in the video and\nmultimodal domain. In this survey, we provide a review of existing approaches\non self-supervised learning focusing on the video domain. We summarize these\nmethods into three different categories based on their learning objectives:\npre-text tasks, generative modeling, and contrastive learning. These approaches\nalso differ in terms of the modality which are being used: video, video-audio,\nvideo-text, and video-audio-text. We further introduce the commonly used\ndatasets, downstream evaluation tasks, insights into the limitations of\nexisting works, and the potential future directions in this area.",

    "abstract": "Most differential privacy mechanisms are applied (i.e., composed) numerous\ntimes on sensitive data. We study the design of optimal differential privacy\nmechanisms in the limit of a large number of compositions. As a consequence of\nthe law of large numbers, in this regime the best privacy mechanism is the one\nthat minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the conditional output\ndistributions of the mechanism given two different inputs. We formulate an\noptimization problem to minimize this divergence subject to a cost constraint\non the noise. We first prove that additive mechanisms are optimal. Since the\noptimization problem is infinite dimensional, it cannot be solved directly;\nnevertheless, we quantize the problem to derive near-optimal additive\nmechanisms that we call \"cactus mechanisms\" due to their shape. We show that\nour quantization approach can be arbitrarily close to an optimal mechanism.\nSurprisingly, for quadratic cost, the Gaussian mechanism is strictly\nsub-optimal compared to this cactus mechanism. Finally, we provide numerical\nresults which indicate that cactus mechanism outperforms the Gaussian mechanism\nfor a finite number of compositions.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved tremendous success in many graph\nmining tasks, benefitting from the message passing strategy that fuses the\nlocal structure and node features for much better graph representation\nlearning. Despite the excellent performance of GNNs, but similar to other type\nof deep neural networks, the robustness of GNNs is unsatisfactory. It have been\ndisclosed by many works that GNNs are vulnerable to unnoticeable perturbations\non both graph structure and node features. Many adversarial attacks have been\nproposed to disclose the fragility of GNNs under different perturbation\nstrategies to create adversarial examples. However, less work has been done to\nshow the vulnerability of GNNs under backdoor attack. To fill this gap, in this\npaper, we present GHAT, transferable GrapH bAckdoor aTtack. The core principle\nof GHAT is to poison training dataset with perturbation triggers that can lead\nto effective and transferable backdoor attack. The perturbation trigger for a\ngraph is generated by performing the perturbation actions on the graph\nstructure via a gradient based score matrix. Compared with the prior works,\nGHAT is different in several ways: it exploits a surrogate GCN model to\ngenerate perturbation trigger for black-box based backdoor attack; it generates\nsample-specific perturbation triggers which do not have fixed pattern; the\nattack of GHAT can be transferable to different GNN models when trained with\nthe poisoned training dataset forged by GHAT. Through extensive evaluation on\nfour real-world datasets, we demonstrate that GHAT shows much better attack\neffectiveness in regard to transferable backdoor attack on GNNs.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing demand for intelligent services, the sixth-generation\n(6G) wireless networks will shift from a traditional architecture that focuses\nsolely on high transmission rate to a new architecture that is based on the\nintelligent connection of everything. Semantic communication (SemCom), a\nrevolutionary architecture that integrates user as well as application\nrequirements and meaning of information into the data processing and\ntransmission, is predicted to become a new core paradigm in 6G. While SemCom is\nexpected to progress beyond the classical Shannon paradigm, several obstacles\nneed to be overcome on the way to a SemCom-enabled smart wireless Internet. In\nthis paper, we first highlight the motivations and compelling reasons of SemCom\nin 6G. Then, we outline the major 6G visions and key enabler techniques which\nlay the foundation of SemCom. Meanwhile, we highlight some benefits of\nSemCom-empowered 6G and present a SemCom-native 6G network architecture. Next,\nwe show the evolution of SemCom from its introduction to classical SemCom\nrelated theory and modern AI-enabled SemCom. Following that, focusing on modern\nSemCom, we classify SemCom into three categories, i.e., semantic-oriented\ncommunication, goal-oriented communication, and semantic-aware communication,\nand introduce three types of semantic metrics. We then discuss the\napplications, the challenges and technologies related to semantics and\ncommunication. Finally, we introduce future research opportunities. In a\nnutshell, this paper investigates the fundamentals of SemCom, its applications\nin 6G networks, and the existing challenges and open issues for further\ndirection.",

    "abstract": "Priming and antipriming can be modelled with error-driven learning (Marsolek,\n2008), by assuming that the learning of the prime influences processing of the\ntarget stimulus. This implies that participants are continuously learning in\npriming studies, and predicts that they are also learning in each trial of\nother psycholinguistic experiments. This study investigates whether\ntrial-to-trial learning can be detected in lexical decision experiments. We\nused the Discriminative Lexicon Model (DLM; Baayen et al., 2019), a model of\nthe mental lexicon with meaning representations from distributional semantics,\nwhich models incremental learning with the Widrow-Hoff rule. We used data from\nthe British Lexicon Project (BLP; Keuleers et al., 2012) and simulated the\nlexical decision experiment with the DLM on a trial-by-trial basis for each\nsubject individually. Then, reaction times for words and nonwords were\npredicted with Generalised Additive Models, using measures derived from the DLM\nsimulations as predictors. Models were developed with the data of two subjects\nand tested on all other subjects. We extracted measures from two simulations\nfor each subject (one with learning updates between trials and one without),\nand used them as input to two GAMs. Learning-based models showed better model\nfit than the non-learning ones for the majority of subjects. Our measures also\nprovided insights into lexical processing and enabled us to explore individual\ndifferences with Linear Mixed Models. This demonstrates the potential of the\nDLM to model behavioural data and leads to the conclusion that trial-to-trial\nlearning can indeed be detected in psycholinguistic experiments.",

    "abstract": "Semantic image interpretation can vastly benefit from approaches that combine\nsub-symbolic distributed representation learning with the capability to reason\nat a higher level of abstraction. Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs) are a class of\nneuro-symbolic systems based on a differentiable, first-order logic grounded\ninto a deep neural network. LTNs replace the classical concept of training set\nwith a knowledge base of fuzzy logical axioms. By defining a set of\ndifferentiable operators to approximate the role of connectives, predicates,\nfunctions and quantifiers, a loss function is automatically specified so that\nLTNs can learn to satisfy the knowledge base. We focus here on the subsumption\nor \\texttt{isOfClass} predicate, which is fundamental to encode most semantic\nimage interpretation tasks. Unlike conventional LTNs, which rely on a separate\npredicate for each class (e.g., dog, cat), each with its own set of learnable\nweights, we propose a common \\texttt{isOfClass} predicate, whose level of truth\nis a function of the distance between an object embedding and the corresponding\nclass prototype. The PROTOtypical Logic Tensor Networks (PROTO-LTN) extend the\ncurrent formulation by grounding abstract concepts as parametrized class\nprototypes in a high-dimensional embedding space, while reducing the number of\nparameters required to ground the knowledge base. We show how this architecture\ncan be effectively trained in the few and zero-shot learning scenarios.\nExperiments on Generalized Zero Shot Learning benchmarks validate the proposed\nimplementation as a competitive alternative to traditional embedding-based\napproaches. The proposed formulation opens up new opportunities in zero shot\nlearning settings, as the LTN formalism allows to integrate background\nknowledge in the form of logical axioms to compensate for the lack of labelled\nexamples.",

    "abstract": "Considering high-temperature heating, the equations of transient heat\nconduction model require an adaptation, i.e. the dependence of thermophysical\nparameters of the model on the temperature is to be identified for each\nspecific material to be heated. This problem is most often solved by\napproximation of the tabular data on the measurements of the required\nparameters, which can be found in the literature, by means of regression\nequations. But, for example, considering the steel heating process, this\napproach is difficult to be implemented due to the lack of tabular discrete\nmeasurements for many grades of steel, such as alloyed ones. In this paper, the\nnew approach is proposed, which is based on a solution of a related variational\nproblem. Its main idea is to substitute the adaptation process in the classical\nsense (i.e., to find the dependencies of thermophysical parameters on\ntemperature) with 'supervised learning' of a mesh model on the basis of the\ntechnological data received from the plant. The equations to adjust the\nparameters of the transient heat conduction model, which are related to the\nthermophysical coefficients, have been derived. A numerical experiment is\nconducted for steel of a particular group of grades, for which enough both\ntechnological as well as tabular data are available. As a result, the 'trained'\nmesh model, which has not received explicitly any information about the\nphysical and chemical properties of the heated substance, demonstrated an\naverage error of 18.820 C, which is quite close to the average error of the\nmodel adapted classically on the basis of the tabular data (18.10 C).",

    "abstract": "Decision-making is critical for lane change in autonomous driving.\nReinforcement learning (RL) algorithms aim to identify the values of behaviors\nin various situations and thus they become a promising pathway to address the\ndecision-making problem. However, poor runtime safety hinders RL-based\ndecision-making strategies from complex driving tasks in practice. To address\nthis problem, human demonstrations are incorporated into the RL-based\ndecision-making strategy in this paper. Decisions made by human subjects in a\ndriving simulator are treated as safe demonstrations, which are stored into the\nreplay buffer and then utilized to enhance the training process of RL. A\ncomplex lane change task in an off-ramp scenario is established to examine the\nperformance of the developed strategy. Simulation results suggest that human\ndemonstrations can effectively improve the safety of decisions of RL. And the\nproposed strategy surpasses other existing learning-based decision-making\nstrategies with respect to multiple driving performances.",

    "abstract": "The field of surgical computer vision has undergone considerable\nbreakthroughs in recent years with the rising popularity of deep neural\nnetwork-based methods. However, standard fully-supervised approaches for\ntraining such models require vast amounts of annotated data, imposing a\nprohibitively high cost; especially in the clinical domain. Self-Supervised\nLearning (SSL) methods, which have begun to gain traction in the general\ncomputer vision community, represent a potential solution to these annotation\ncosts, allowing to learn useful representations from only unlabeled data.\nStill, the effectiveness of SSL methods in more complex and impactful domains,\nsuch as medicine and surgery, remains limited and unexplored. In this work, we\naddress this critical need by investigating four state-of-the-art SSL methods\n(MoCo v2, SimCLR, DINO, SwAV) in the context of surgical computer vision. We\npresent an extensive analysis of the performance of these methods on the\nCholec80 dataset for two fundamental and popular tasks in surgical context\nunderstanding, phase recognition and tool presence detection. We examine their\nparameterization, then their behavior with respect to training data quantities\nin semi-supervised settings. Correct transfer of these methods to surgery, as\ndescribed and conducted in this work, leads to substantial performance gains\nover generic uses of SSL - up to 7% on phase recognition and 20% on tool\npresence detection - as well as state-of-the-art semi-supervised phase\nrecognition approaches by up to 14%.

    "abstract": "Approximate computing is an emerging computing paradigm that offers improved\npower consumption by relaxing the requirement for full accuracy. Since\nreal-world applications may have different requirements for design accuracy,\none trend of approximate computing is to design runtime quality-configurable\ncircuits, which are able to operate under different accuracy modes with\ndifferent power consumption. In this paper, we present a novel framework RUCA\nwhich aims to approximate an arbitrary input circuit in a runtime configurable\nfashion. By factorizing and decomposing the truth table, our approach aims to\napproximate and separate the input circuit into multiple configuration blocks\nwhich support different accuracy levels, including a corrector circuit to\nrestore full accuracy. By activating different blocks, the approximate circuit\nis able to operate at different accuracy-power configurations. To improve the\nscalability of our algorithm, we also provide a design space exploration scheme\nwith circuit partitioning to navigate the search space of possible\napproximations of subcircuits during design time. We thoroughly evaluate our\nmethodology on a set of benchmarks and compare against another\nquality-configurable approach, showcasing the benefits and flexibility of RUCA.\nFor 3-level designs, RUCA saves power consumption by 36.57% within 1% error and\nby 51.32% within 2% error on average.",

    "abstract": "Embedding knowledge graphs into low-dimensional spaces is a popular method\nfor applying approaches, such as link prediction or node classification, to\nthese databases. This embedding process is very costly in terms of both\ncomputational time and space. Part of the reason for this is the optimisation\nof hyperparameters, which involves repeatedly sampling, by random, guided, or\nbrute-force selection, from a large hyperparameter space and testing the\nresulting embeddings for their quality. However, not all hyperparameters in\nthis search space will be equally important. In fact, with prior knowledge of\nthe relative importance of the hyperparameters, some could be eliminated from\nthe search altogether without significantly impacting the overall quality of\nthe outputted embeddings. To this end, we ran a Sobol sensitivity analysis to\nevaluate the effects of tuning different hyperparameters on the variance of\nembedding quality. This was achieved by performing thousands of embedding\ntrials, each time measuring the quality of embeddings produced by different\nhyperparameter configurations. We regressed the embedding quality on those\nhyperparameter configurations, using this model to generate Sobol sensitivity\nindices for each of the hyperparameters. By evaluating the correlation between\nSobol indices, we find substantial variability in the hyperparameter\nsensitivities between knowledge graphs with differing dataset characteristics\nas the probable cause of these inconsistencies. As an additional contribution\nof this work we identify several relations in the UMLS knowledge graph that may\ncause data leakage via inverse relations, and derive and present UMLS-43, a\nleakage-robust variant of that graph.",

This proxy translates and emphasizes the segmentation flaws. By\nmaximizing the structural similarity between the raw input and the proxy, the\nreflection-on-action loop is closed with segmentation robustness improved.\nRefSeg runs in the testing phase and is general for segmentation models.\nExtensive validation on three medical image segmentation tasks with a public\ncardiac MR dataset and two in-house large ultrasound datasets show that our\nRefSeg remarkably improves model robustness and reports state-of-the-art\nperformance over strong competitors.",

To achieve adaptive motion plans for a\nspecific application environment, e.g., desk assembly or warehouse\nloading/unloading, a library is built by abstracting features of common human\ndemonstrated tasks.

    "abstract": "Over the past decades, the incidence of thyroid cancer has been increasing\nglobally. Accurate and early diagnosis allows timely treatment and helps to\navoid over-diagnosis. Clinically, a nodule is commonly evaluated from both\ntransverse and longitudinal views using thyroid ultrasound. However, the\nappearance of the thyroid gland and lesions can vary dramatically across\nindividuals. Identifying key diagnostic information from both views requires\nspecialized expertise. Furthermore, finding an optimal way to integrate\nmulti-view information also relies on the experience of clinicians and adds\nfurther difficulty to accurate diagnosis. To address these, we propose a\npersonalized diagnostic tool that can customize its decision-making process for\ndifferent patients. It consists of a multi-view classification module for\nfeature extraction and a personalized weighting allocation network that\ngenerates optimal weighting for different views. It is also equipped with a\nself-supervised view-aware contrastive loss to further improve the model\nrobustness towards different patient groups. Experimental results show that the\nproposed framework can better utilize multi-view information and outperform the\ncompeting methods.",

    "abstract": "Across a multitude of work environments, expert knowledge is imperative for\nhumans to conduct tasks with high performance and ensure business success.\nThese humans possess task-specific expert knowledge (TSEK) and hence, represent\nsubject matter experts (SMEs). However, not only demographic changes but also\npersonnel downsizing strategies lead and will continue to lead to departures of\nSMEs within organizations, which constitutes the challenge of how to retain\nthat expert knowledge and train novices to keep the competitive advantage\nelicited by that expert knowledge.

In this workshop paper, we (1) propose a framework on how HAIC\ncan be utilized to train novices on particular tasks, (2) illustrate the role\nof explicit and tacit knowledge in this training process via HAIC, and (3)\noutline a preliminary experiment design to assess the ability of AI systems in\nHAIC to act as a trainer to transfer TSEK to novices who do not possess prior\nTSEK.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we present a novel self-supervised method to anticipate the\ndepth estimate for a future, unobserved real-world urban scene. This work is\nthe first to explore self-supervised learning for estimation of monocular depth\nof future unobserved frames of a video. Existing works rely on a large number\nof annotated samples to generate the probabilistic prediction of depth for\nunseen frames. However, this makes it unrealistic due to its requirement for\nlarge amount of annotated depth samples of video. In addition, the\nprobabilistic nature of the case, where one past can have multiple future\noutcomes often leads to incorrect depth estimates. Unlike previous methods, we\nmodel the depth estimation of the unobserved frame as a view-synthesis problem,\nwhich treats the depth estimate of the unseen video frame as an auxiliary task\nwhile synthesizing back the views using learned pose. This approach is not only\ncost effective - we do not use any ground truth depth for training (hence\npractical) but also deterministic (a sequence of past frames map to an\nimmediate future). To address this task we first develop a novel depth\nforecasting network DeFNet which estimates depth of unobserved future by\nforecasting latent features. Second, we develop a channel-attention based pose\nestimation network that estimates the pose of the unobserved frame. Using this\nlearned pose, estimated depth map is reconstructed back into the image domain,\nthus forming a self-supervised solution. Our proposed approach shows\nsignificant improvements in Abs Rel metric compared to state-of-the-art\nalternatives on both short and mid-term forecasting setting, benchmarked on\nKITTI and Cityscapes.

To demonstrate, we combine manifold learning method UMAP for\ninferring the topological structure with density-based clustering method\nDBSCAN. Synthetic and real data results show that this both simplifies and\nimproves clustering in a diverse set of low- and high-dimensional problems\nincluding clusters of varying density and/or entangled shapes. Our approach\nsimplifies clustering because topological pre-processing consistently reduces\nparameter sensitivity of DBSCAN. Clustering the resulting embeddings with\nDBSCAN can then even outperform complex methods such as SPECTACL and\nClusterGAN. Finally, our investigation suggests that the crucial issue in\nclustering does not appear to be the nominal dimension of the data or how many\nirrelevant features it contains, but rather how \\textit{separable} the clusters\nare in the ambient observation space they are embedded in, which is usually the\n(high-dimensional) Euclidean space defined by the features of the data.

The LoMaC\nproperty refers to the exact local conservation of macroscopic mass, momentum\nand energy at the discrete level. This is a follow-up work of our previous\ndevelopment of a conservative low rank tensor approach for Vlasov dynamics\n(arXiv:2201.10397). In that work, we applied a low rank tensor method with a\nconservative singular value decomposition (SVD) to the high dimensional VP\nsystem to mitigate the curse of dimensionality, while maintaining the local\nconservation of mass and momentum. However, energy conservation is not\nguaranteed, which is a critical property to avoid unphysical plasma\nself-heating or cooling. The new ingredient in the LoMaC low rank tensor\nalgorithm is that we simultaneously evolve the macroscopic conservation laws of\nmass, momentum and energy using a flux-difference form with kinetic flux vector\nsplitting; then the LoMaC property is realized by projecting the low rank\nkinetic solution onto a subspace that shares the same macroscopic observables\nby a conservative orthogonal projection.

We focus on the particularly\nchallenging situation where the past dynamical state time series that is\navailable for ML training predominantly lies in a restricted region of the\nstate space, while the behavior to be predicted evolves on a larger state space\nset not fully observed by the ML model during training. In this situation, it\nis required that the ML prediction system have the ability to extrapolate to\ndifferent dynamics past that which is observed during training. We investigate\nthe extent to which ML methods are capable of accomplishing useful results for\nthis task, as well as conditions under which they fail. In general, we found\nthat the ML methods were surprisingly effective even in situations that were\nextremely challenging, but do (as one would expect) fail when ``too much\"\nextrapolation is required. For the latter case, we investigate the\neffectiveness of combining the ML approach with conventional modeling based on\nscientific knowledge, thus forming a hybrid prediction system which we find can\nenable useful prediction even when its ML-based and knowledge-based components\nfail when acting alone. We also found that achieving useful results may require\nusing very carefully selected ML hyperparameters and we propose a\nhyperparameter optimization strategy to address this problem. The main\nconclusion of this paper is that ML-based approaches are promising tools for\npredicting the behavior of non-stationary dynamical systems even in the case\nwhere the future evolution (perhaps due to the crossing of a tipping point)\nincludes dynamics on a set outside of that explored by the training data.",

The neural network-based architecture can also integrate with other\ndeep learning architectures so that it can analyze high-dimensional data while\nbeing trained end-to-end. To this end we integrate our architecture with\nconvolutional neural networks to analyze 1D images of varying spring systems.",

    "title": "Masked Autoencoders for Self-Supervised Learning on Automotive Point  Clouds",
    "abstract": "Masked autoencoding has become a successful pre-training paradigm for\nTransformer models for text, images, and recently, point clouds. Raw automotive\ndatasets are a suitable candidate for self-supervised pre-training as they\ngenerally are cheap to collect compared to annotations for tasks like 3D object\ndetection (OD). However, development of masked autoencoders for point clouds\nhas focused solely on synthetic and indoor data. Consequently, existing methods\nhave tailored their representations and models toward point clouds which are\nsmall, dense and have homogeneous point density. In this work, we study masked\nautoencoding for point clouds in an automotive setting, which are sparse and\nfor which the point density can vary drastically among objects in the same\nscene. To this end, we propose Voxel-MAE, a simple masked autoencoding\npre-training scheme designed for voxel representations. We pre-train the\nbackbone of a Transformer-based 3D object detector to reconstruct masked voxels\nand to distinguish between empty and non-empty voxels. Our method improves the\n3D OD performance by 1.75 mAP points and 1.05 NDS on the challenging nuScenes\ndataset. Compared to existing self-supervised methods for automotive data,\nVoxel-MAE displays up to $2\\times$ performance increase. Further, we show that\nby pre-training with Voxel-MAE, we require only 40% of the annotated data to\noutperform a randomly initialized equivalent. Code will be released.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the multi-user scheduling problem in millimeter\nwave (mmWave) video streaming networks, which comprise a streaming server and\nseveral users, each requesting a video stream with a different resolution. The\nmain objective is to optimize the long-term average quality of experience (QoE)\nfor all users. We tackle this problem by considering the physical layer\ncharacteristics of the mmWave network, including the beam alignment overhead\ndue to pencil-beams. To develop an efficient scheduling policy, we leverage the\ncontextual multi-armed bandit (MAB) models to propose a beam alignment overhead\nand buffer predictive streaming solution, dubbed B2P-Stream. The proposed\nB2P-Stream algorithm optimally balances the trade-off between the overhead and\nusers' buffer levels and improves the QoE by reducing the beam alignment\noverhead for users of higher resolutions. We also provide a theoretical\nguarantee for our proposed method and prove that it guarantees a sub-linear\nregret bound. Finally, we examine our proposed framework through extensive\nsimulations. We provide a detailed comparison of the B2P-Stream against\nuniformly random and Round-robin (RR) policies and show that it outperforms\nboth of them in providing a better QoE and fairness. We also analyze the\nscalability and robustness of the B2P-Stream algorithm with different network\nconfigurations.",

    "title": "Transforming Image Generation from Scene Graphs",
    "abstract": "Generating images from semantic visual knowledge is a challenging task, that\ncan be useful to condition the synthesis process in complex, subtle, and\nunambiguous ways, compared to alternatives such as class labels or text\ndescriptions. Although generative methods conditioned by semantic\nrepresentations exist, they do not provide a way to control the generation\nprocess aside from the specification of constraints between objects. As an\nexample, the possibility to iteratively generate or modify images by manually\nadding specific items is a desired property that, to our knowledge, has not\nbeen fully investigated in the literature. In this work we propose a\ntransformer-based approach conditioned by scene graphs that, conversely to\nrecent transformer-based methods, also employs a decoder to autoregressively\ncompose images, making the synthesis process more effective and controllable.\nThe proposed architecture is composed by three modules: 1) a graph\nconvolutional network, to encode the relationships of the input graph; 2) an\nencoder-decoder transformer, which autoregressively composes the output image;\n3) an auto-encoder, employed to generate representations used as input/output\nof each generation step by the transformer. Results obtained on CIFAR10 and\nMNIST images show that our model is able to satisfy semantic constraints\ndefined by a scene graph and to model relations between visual objects in the\nscene by taking into account a user-provided partial rendering of the desired\ntarget.",

    "abstract": "The emerging class of instance-optimized systems has shown potential to\nachieve high performance by specializing to a specific data and query\nworkloads. Particularly, Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been applied\nsuccessfully to build various instance-optimized components (e.g., learned\nindexes). This paper investigates to leverage ML techniques to enhance the\nperformance of spatial indexes, particularly the R-tree, for a given data and\nquery workloads. As the areas covered by the R-tree index nodes overlap in\nspace, upon searching for a specific point in space, multiple paths from root\nto leaf may potentially be explored. In the worst case, the entire R-tree could\nbe searched. In this paper, we define and use the overlap ratio to quantify the\ndegree of extraneous leaf node accesses required by a range query. The goal is\nto enhance the query performance of a traditional R-tree for high-overlap range\nqueries as they tend to incur long running-times. We introduce a new AI-tree\nthat transforms the search operation of an R-tree into a multi-label\nclassification task to exclude the extraneous leaf node accesses. Then, we\naugment a traditional R-tree to the AI-tree to form a hybrid \"AI+R\"-tree. The\n\"AI+R\"-tree can automatically differentiate between the high- and low-overlap\nqueries using a learned model. Thus, the \"AI+R\"-tree processes high-overlap\nqueries using the AI-tree, and the low-overlap queries using the R-tree.\nExperiments on real datasets demonstrate that the \"AI+R\"-tree can enhance the\nquery performance over a traditional R-tree by up to 500%.",

Therefore, the translation model of this language requires a\nmechanism that is even lower than the word level, referred to as the sub-word\nlevel. This compounding process leads to a rare word problem since the number\nof vocabulary explodes. We propose a strategy to address the unique word\nproblem of the neural machine translation (NMT) system, which uses Indonesian\nas a pair language. Our approach uses a rule-based method to transform a word\ninto its roots and accompanied affixes to retain its meaning and context. Using\na rule-based algorithm has more advantages: it does not require corpus data but\nonly applies the standard Indonesian rules. Our experiments confirm that this\nmethod is practical.

    "abstract": "The probing methodology allows one to obtain a partial representation of\nlinguistic phenomena stored in the inner layers of the neural network, using\nexternal classifiers and statistical analysis. Pre-trained transformer-based\nlanguage models are widely used both for natural language understanding (NLU)\nand natural language generation (NLG) tasks making them most commonly used for\ndownstream applications. However, little analysis was carried out, whether the\nmodels were pre-trained enough or contained knowledge correlated with\nlinguistic theory. We are presenting the chronological probing study of\ntransformer English models such as MultiBERT and T5. We sequentially compare\nthe information about the language learned by the models in the process of\ntraining on corpora. The results show that 1) linguistic information is\nacquired in the early stages of training 2) both language models demonstrate\ncapabilities to capture various features from various levels of language,\nincluding morphology, syntax, and even discourse, while they also can\ninconsistently fail on tasks that are perceived as easy.

Due to its complexity, existing algorithms either\nutilize simplifying assumptions or are incomplete. This work introduces\nkinodynamic conflict-based search (K-CBS), a decentralized (decoupled) MRMP\nalgorithm that is general, scalable, and probabilistically complete. The\nalgorithm takes inspiration from successful solutions to the discrete analogue\nof MRMP over finite graphs, known as multi-agent path finding (MAPF).\nSpecifically, we adapt ideas from conflict-based search (CBS) - a popular\ndecentralized MAPF algorithm - to the MRMP setting. The novelty in this\nadaptation is that we work directly in the continuous domain, without the need\nfor discretization. In particular, the kinodynamic constraints are treated\nnatively. K-CBS plans for each robot individually using a low-level planner and\nand grows a conflict tree to resolve collisions between robots by defining\nconstraints for individual robots. The low-level planner can be any\nsampling-based, tree-search algorithm for kinodynamic robots, thus lifting\nexisting planners for single robots to the multi-robot settings.

Ethanol of area-equivalent radius about 1.29 mm was\ndropped from impact heights ranging from 4 cm to 60 cm (splashing threshold 20\ncm) and impacted on a hydrophilic surface. The images captured when half of the\ndrop impacted the surface were labeled according to their outcome, splashing or\nnonsplashing, and were used to train an FNN. A classification accuracy higher\nthan 96% was achieved. To extract the image features identified by the FNN for\nclassification, the weight matrix of the trained FNN for identifying splashing\ndrops was visualized. Remarkably, the visualization showed that the trained FNN\nidentified the contour height of the main body of the impacting drop as an\nimportant characteristic differentiating between splashing and nonsplashing\ndrops, which has not been reported in previous studies. This feature was found\nthroughout the impact, even when one and three-quarters of the drop impacted\nthe surface. To confirm the importance of this image feature, the FNN was\nretrained to classify using only the main body without checking for the\npresence of ejected secondary droplets. The accuracy was still higher than 82%,\nconfirming that the contour height is an important feature distinguishing\nsplashing from nonsplashing drops. Several aspects of drop impact are analyzed\nand discussed with the aim of identifying the possible mechanism underlying the\ndifference in contour height between splashing and nonsplashing drops.",

The combination of linear and bilinear terms has been shown to\nbe very useful in modelling this type of data. A widely-used approach to\nidentify GxE is the Additive Main Effects and Multiplicative Interaction\nEffects (AMMI) model. However, as data frequently can be high-dimensional,\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches can be computationally infeasible.\nIn this article, we consider a variational inference approach for such a model.\nWe derive variational approximations for estimating the parameters and we\ncompare the approximations to MCMC using both simulated and real data.

We demonstrated the success of this computational method\nusing Vero E6 cells and vesicular stomatitis virus.

This data-driven plaque assay also offers\nthe capability of quantifying the infected area of the cell monolayer,\nperforming automated counting and quantification of PFUs and virus-infected\nareas over a 10-fold larger dynamic range of virus concentration than standard\nviral plaque assays.

Existing methods mainly rely on individual 2D ultrasound images or\ncombine unlabeled video and labeled 2D images to train models for breast lesion\ndetection. In this paper, we first collect and annotate an ultrasound video\ndataset (188 videos) for breast lesion detection. Moreover, we propose a\nclip-level and video-level feature aggregated network (CVA-Net) for addressing\nbreast lesion detection in ultrasound videos by aggregating video-level lesion\nclassification features and clip-level temporal features. The clip-level\ntemporal features encode local temporal information of ordered video frames and\nglobal temporal information of shuffled video frames. In our CVA-Net, an\ninter-video fusion module is devised to fuse local features from original video\nframes and global features from shuffled video frames, and an intra-video\nfusion module is devised to learn the temporal information among adjacent video\nframes. Moreover, we learn video-level features to classify the breast lesions\nof the original video as benign or malignant lesions to further enhance the\nfinal breast lesion detection performance in ultrasound videos. Experimental\nresults on our annotated dataset demonstrate that our CVA-Net clearly\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods.

We first propose a measure,\nCorrectness-Confidence Rank Correlation (CCRC), to capture how predictions'\nconfidence estimates correlate with their correctness scores in rank. A model\nwith a high value of CCRC means its prediction confidences reliably suggest\nwhich samples' predictions are more likely to be correct. Since CCRC does not\ncapture the actual prediction correctness, it alone is insufficient to indicate\nwhether a prediction model is both accurate and reliable to use in practice.\nTherefore, we further propose another method, Usable Region Estimate (URE),\nwhich simultaneously quantifies predictions' correctness and reliability of\nconfidence assessments in one estimate. URE provides concrete information on to\nwhat extent a model's predictions are usable. In addition, the sizes of usable\nregions (UR) can be utilized to compare models: A model with a larger UR can be\ntaken as a more usable and hence better model. Experiments on six datasets\nvalidate that the proposed evaluation methods perform well, providing a\nconcrete and concise measure for the practical usability of medical image\nsegmentation models.

In this research, three experiment sets were\nconducted with a U-Net architecture to improve the classification performance\nwhile enhancing the heatmaps corresponding to the model's focus through\nincorporating heatmap generators during training. All of the experiments used\nthe dataset that contained chest radiographs, associated labels from one of the\nthree conditions (\"normal\", \"congestive heart failure (CHF)\", and \"pneumonia\"),\nand numerical information regarding a radiologist's eye-gaze coordinates on the\nimages. The paper (A.

To compare the classification performances, the 95%\nconfidence intervals (CI) of the area under the receiver operating\ncharacteristic curve (AUC) were measured. The best method achieved an AUC of\n0.913 (CI: 0.860-0.966). The greatest improvements were for the \"pneumonia\" and\n\"CHF\" classes, which the baseline model struggled most to classify, resulting\nin AUCs of 0.859 (CI: 0.732-0.957) and 0.962 (CI: 0.933-0.989), respectively.\nThe proposed method's decoder was also able to produce probability masks that\nhighlight the determining image parts in model classifications, similarly as\nthe radiologist's eye-gaze data.

However, existing approaches to\ndifferentiable simulation have largely tackled scenarios where obtaining smooth\ngradients has been relatively easy, such as systems with mostly smooth\ndynamics. In this work, we study the challenges that differentiable simulation\npresents when it is not feasible to expect that a single descent reaches a\nglobal optimum, which is often a problem in contact-rich scenarios. We analyze\nthe optimization landscapes of diverse scenarios that contain both rigid bodies\nand deformable objects. In dynamic environments with highly deformable objects\nand fluids, differentiable simulators produce rugged landscapes with\nnonetheless useful gradients in some parts of the space. We propose a method\nthat combines Bayesian optimization with semi-local 'leaps' to obtain a global\nsearch method that can use gradients effectively, while also maintaining robust\nperformance in regions with noisy gradients. We show that our approach\noutperforms several gradient-based and gradient-free baselines on an extensive\nset of experiments in simulation, and also validate the method using\nexperiments with a real robot and deformables.

    "title": "On the Performance of Data Compression in Clustered Fog Radio Access  Networks",
    "abstract": "The fog-radio-access-network (F-RAN) has been proposed to address the strict\nlatency requirements, which offloads computation tasks generated in user\nequipments (UEs) to the edge to reduce the processing latency. However, it\nincorporates the task transmission latency, which may become the bottleneck of\nlatency requirements. Data compression (DC) has been considered as one of the\npromising techniques to reduce the transmission latency. By compressing the\ncomputation tasks before transmitting, the transmission delay is reduced due to\nthe shrink transmitted data size, and the original computing task can be\nretrieved by employing data decompressing (DD) at the edge nodes or the centre\ncloud. Nevertheless, the DC and DD incorporate extra processing latency, and\nthe latency performance has not been investigated in the large-scale DC-enabled\nF-RAN. Therefore, in this work, the successful data compression probability\n(SDCP) is defined to analyse the latency performance of the F-RAN. Moreover, to\nanalyse the effect of compression offloading ratio (COR), a novel hybrid\ncompression mode is proposed based on the queueing theory. Based on this, the\nclosed-form result of SDCP in the large-scale DC-enabled F-RAN is derived by\ncombining the Matern cluster process and M/G/1 queueing model, and validated by\nMonte Carlo simulations. Based on the derived SDCP results, the effects of COR\non the SDCP is analysed numerically. The results show that the SDCP with the\noptimal COR can be enhanced with a maximum value of 0.3 and 0.55 as compared\nwith the cases of compressing all computing tasks at the edge and at the UE,\nrespectively. Moreover, for the system requiring the minimal latency, the\nproposed hybrid compression mode can alleviate the requirement on the backhaul\ncapacity.",

    "abstract": "Despite being considered as the next frontier in computation, Quantum\nComputing is still in an early stage of development. Indeed, current commercial\nquantum computers suffer from some critical restraints, such as noisy processes\nand a limited amount of qubits, among others, that affect the performance of\nquantum algorithms. Despite these limitations, researchers have devoted much\neffort to propose different frameworks for efficiently using these Noisy\nIntermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. One of these procedures is D'WAVE\nSystems' quantum-annealer, which can be use to solve optimization problems by\ntranslating them into an energy minimization problem. In this context, this\nwork is focused on providing useful insights and information into the behaviour\nof the quantum-annealer when addressing real-world combinatorial optimization\nproblems. Our main motivation with this study is to open some quantum computing\nfrontiers to non-expert stakeholders. To this end, we perform an extensive\nexperimentation, in the form of a parameter sensitive analysis. This\nexperimentation has been conducted using the Traveling Salesman Problem as\nbenchmarking problem, and adopting two QUBOs: state-of-the-art and a\nheuristically generated. Our analysis has been performed on a single 7-noded\ninstance, and it is based on more than 200 different parameter configurations,\ncomprising more than 3700 unitary runs and 7 million of quantum reads.

In the anti-coordination network game, there is\na preferred action in the absence of neighbors' actions, and the utility an\nagent receives from the preferred action decreases as more of its neighbors\nselect the preferred action, potentially causing the agent to select a less\ndesirable action. The decentralized dynamics that is based on the iterated\nelimination of dominated strategies converge for the considered game. Given a\nconvergent action profile, we measure anti-coordination by the number of edges\nin the underlying graph that have at least one agent in either end of the edge\nnot taking the preferred action. The maximum anti-coordination (MAC) problem\nseeks to find an optimal set of agents to control under a finite budget so that\nthe overall network disconnect is maximized on game convergence as a result of\nthe dynamics. We show that the MAC is submodular in expectation in dense\nbipartite networks for any realization of the utility constants in the\npopulation.

The reason is not only that the gradient signal\nneglects the minority classes, but also that the minority classes are subject\nto a larger directional noise, which slows their learning by an amount related\nto the imbalance ratio.

    "abstract": "We devise constant-factor approximation algorithms for finding as many\ndisjoint cycles as possible from a certain family of cycles in a given planar\nor bounded-genus graph. Here disjoint can mean vertex-disjoint or\nedge-disjoint, and the graph can be undirected or directed. The family of\ncycles under consideration must satisfy two properties: it must be uncrossable\nand allow for an oracle access that finds a weight-minimal cycle in that family\nfor given nonnegative edge weights or (in planar graphs) the union of all\nremaining cycles in that family after deleting a given subset of edges.\nOur setting generalizes many problems that were studied separately in the\npast. For example, three families that satisfy the above properties are (i) all\ncycles in a directed or undirected graph, (ii) all odd cycles in an undirected\ngraph, and (iii) all cycles in an undirected graph that contain precisely one\ndemand edge, where the demand edges form a subset of the edge set. The latter\nfamily (iii) corresponds to the classical disjoint paths problem in fully\nplanar and bounded-genus instances. While constant-factor approximation\nalgorithms were known for edge-disjoint paths in such instances, we improve the\nconstant in the planar case and obtain the first such algorithms for\nvertex-disjoint paths. We also obtain approximate min-max theorems of the\nErd\\H{o}s--P\\'osa type. For example, the minimum feedback vertex set in a\nplanar digraph is at most 12 times the maximum number of vertex-disjoint\ncycles.",

    "abstract": "Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive 3D modality widely used\nin ophthalmology for imaging the retina. Achieving automated, anatomically\ncoherent retinal layer segmentation on OCT is important for the detection and\nmonitoring of different retinal diseases, like Age-related Macular Disease\n(AMD) or Diabetic Retinopathy. However, the majority of state-of-the-art layer\nsegmentation methods are based on purely supervised deep-learning, requiring a\nlarge amount of pixel-level annotated data that is expensive and hard to\nobtain. With this in mind, we introduce a semi-supervised paradigm into the\nretinal layer segmentation task that makes use of the information present in\nlarge-scale unlabeled datasets as well as anatomical priors. In particular, a\nnovel fully differentiable approach is used for converting surface position\nregression into a pixel-wise structured segmentation, allowing to use both 1D\nsurface and 2D layer representations in a coupled fashion to train the model.\nIn particular, these 2D segmentations are used as anatomical factors that,\ntogether with learned style factors, compose disentangled representations used\nfor reconstructing the input image. In parallel, we propose a set of anatomical\npriors to improve network training when a limited amount of labeled data is\navailable. We demonstrate on the real-world dataset of scans with intermediate\nand wet-AMD that our method outperforms state-of-the-art when using our full\ntraining set, but more importantly largely exceeds state-of-the-art when it is\ntrained with a fraction of the labeled data.",

In this paper, we propose a method to generate multiple\nreconstructions that fit both the measurements and a data-driven prior learned\nby a generative adversarial network. In particular, we show that, starting from\nan initial solution, it is possible to find directions in the latent space of\nthe generative model that are null to the forward operator, and thus keep\nconsistency with the measurements, while inducing significant perceptual\nchange. Our exploration approach allows to generate multiple solutions to the\ninverse problem an order of magnitude faster than existing approaches; we show\nresults on image super-resolution and inpainting problems.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents karma mechanisms, a novel approach to the repeated\nallocation of a scarce resource among competing agents over an infinite time.\nExamples of such resource allocation problems include deciding which trip\nrequests to serve in a ride-hailing platform during peak demand, granting the\nright of way in intersections, or admitting internet content to a fast channel\nfor improved quality of service. We study a simplified yet insightful\nformulation of these problems where at every time two agents from a large\npopulation get randomly matched to compete over the resource. The intuitive\ninterpretation of a karma mechanism is \"If I give in now, I will be rewarded in\nthe future.\" Agents compete in an auction-like setting where they bid units of\nkarma, which circulates directly among them and is self-contained in the\nsystem. We demonstrate that this allows a society of self-interested agents to\nachieve high levels of efficiency without resorting to a (possibly problematic)\nmonetary pricing of the resource. We model karma mechanisms as dynamic\npopulation games, in which agents have private states - their urgency to\nacquire the resource and how much karma they have - that vary in time based on\ntheir strategic decisions. We adopt the stationary Nash equilibrium as the\nsolution concept and prove its existence. We then analyze the performance at\nthe stationary Nash equilibrium numerically. For the case where the agents have\nhomogeneous preferences, we compare different mechanism design choices which\nallow to strike trade-offs between efficiency and fairness metrics, showing how\nit is possible to achieve an efficient and ex-post fair allocation when the\nagents are future aware. Finally, we test the robustness of the mechanisms\nagainst heterogeneity in the urgency processes and the future awareness of the\nagents and propose remedies to some of the observed phenomena via karma\nredistribution.",

When each variable is\ninvolved in at most two linear constraints, we show that the problem can be\npartially solved analytically, in particular we show that upon convergence, the\nzero-temperature limit of the cavity equations returns the optimal solution. We\nthen study the geometrical properties of more general random ensembles.

    "abstract": "This paper demonstrates spherical convolutional neural networks (S-CNN) offer\ndistinct advantages over conventional fully-connected networks (FCN) at\nestimating scalar parameters of tissue microstructure from diffusion MRI\n(dMRI). Such microstructure parameters are valuable for identifying pathology\nand quantifying its extent. However, current clinical practice commonly\nacquires dMRI data consisting of only 6 diffusion weighted images (DWIs),\nlimiting the accuracy and precision of estimated microstructure indices.\nMachine learning (ML) has been proposed to address this challenge. However,\nexisting ML-based methods are not robust to differing dMRI gradient sampling\nschemes, nor are they rotation equivariant. Lack of robustness to sampling\nschemes requires a new network to be trained for each scheme, complicating the\nanalysis of data from multiple sources. A possible consequence of the lack of\nrotational equivariance is that the training dataset must contain a diverse\nrange of microstucture orientations. Here, we show spherical CNNs represent a\ncompelling alternative that is robust to new sampling schemes as well as\noffering rotational equivariance. We show the latter can be leveraged to\ndecrease the number of training datapoints required.",
