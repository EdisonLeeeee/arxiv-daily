    "abstract": "We propose VDL-Surrogate, a view-dependent neural-network-latent-based\nsurrogate model for parameter space exploration of ensemble simulations that\nallows high-resolution visualizations and user-specified visual mappings.\nSurrogate-enabled parameter space exploration allows domain scientists to\npreview simulation results without having to run a large number of\ncomputationally costly simulations. Limited by computational resources,\nhowever, existing surrogate models may not produce previews with sufficient\nresolution for visualization and analysis. To improve the efficient use of\ncomputational resources and support high-resolution exploration, we perform ray\ncasting from different viewpoints to collect samples and produce compact latent\nrepresentations. This latent encoding process reduces the cost of surrogate\nmodel training while maintaining the output quality. In the model training\nstage, we select viewpoints to cover the whole viewing sphere and train\ncorresponding VDL-Surrogate models for the selected viewpoints. In the model\ninference stage, we predict the latent representations at previously selected\nviewpoints and decode the latent representations to data space. For any given\nviewpoint, we make interpolations over decoded data at selected viewpoints and\ngenerate visualizations with user-specified visual mappings. We show the\neffectiveness and efficiency of VDL-Surrogate in cosmological and ocean\nsimulations with quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

    "title": "Integration of Renewable Energy Sources for Low Emission Microgrids in  Canadian Remote Communities",
    "abstract": "In recent years, the electrification of Canadian Remote Communities (RCs) has\nreceived significant attention, as their current electric energy systems are\nnot only expensive, but are also highly polluting due to the prevalence of\ndiesel generators. In addition, RCs' inherent geographic characteristics impose\na series of challenges that must be considered when planning their electricity\nsupply. Thus, in this paper, an optimization model for the long-term planning\nof RC Microgrids (MGs) including Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) and Energy\nStorage Systems (ESSs) is proposed, with the objective of reducing costs and\nemissions. The proposed model considers lithium-ion batteries and hydrogen\nsystems as part of ESSs technologies. The model is used to investigate the\nfeasibility of integrating RESs and ESSs in an MG in Sanikiluaq, an RC in the\nNunavut territory in Northern Canada. The results show that wind resources\nalong with solar and storage technologies can play a key role in satisfying RC\nelectricity demand, while significantly reducing costs and Greenhouse Gas\nEmissions (GHG). In addition, insights on sustainable and affordable policies\nfor RC MGs are provided.",

    "abstract": "The Search Engine Results Page (SERP) has evolved significantly over the last\ntwo decades, moving away from the simple ten blue links paradigm to\nconsiderably more complex presentations that contain results from multiple\nverticals and granularities of textual information. Prior works have\ninvestigated how user interactions on the SERP are influenced by the presence\nor absence of heterogeneous content (e.g., images, videos, or news content),\nthe layout of the SERP (list vs. grid layout), and task complexity. In this\npaper, we reproduce the user studies conducted in prior works-specifically\nthose of Arguello et al. [4] and Siu and Chaparro [29]-to explore to what\nextent the findings from research conducted five to ten years ago still hold\ntoday as the average web user has become accustomed to SERPs with\never-increasing presentational complexity. To this end, we designed and ran a\nuser study with four different SERP interfaces: (i) a heterogeneous grid; (ii)\na heterogeneous list; (iii) a simple grid; and (iv) a simple list. We collected\nthe interactions of 41 study participants over 12 search tasks for our\nanalyses. We observed that SERP types and task complexity affect user\ninteractions with search results. We also find evidence to support most (6 out\nof 8) observations from [4 , 29] indicating that user interactions with\ndifferent interfaces and to solve tasks of different complexity have remained\nmostly similar over time.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of scheduling precedence-constrained jobs on\nheterogenous machines in the presence of non-uniform machine-dependent\ncommunication delays. We are given as input a set of $n$ unit size\nprecedence-constrained jobs, and a set of $m$ related machines each with size\n$m_i$ (machine $i$ can execute at most $m_i$ jobs at any time). Each machine\n$i$ also has an associated in-delay $\\rho^{\\mathrm{in}}_i$ and out-delay\n$\\rho^{\\mathrm{out}}_i$. For any job $v$, machine $i$, and time $t$, we say\nthat $v$ is available to machine $i$ at time $t$ if $v$ is completed on $i$\nbefore time $t$ or on any machine $j$ before time $t - (\\rho^{\\mathrm{in}}_i +\n\\rho^{\\mathrm{out}}_j)$. If job $v$ is scheduled at time $t$ on machine $i$,\nthen all of its predecessors must be available to $i$ by time $t$. The\nobjective is to construct a schedule that minimizes makespan, which is the\nmaximum completion time over all jobs.\nWe consider schedules which allow duplication of jobs as well as schedules\nwhich do not. When duplication is allowed, we provide an asymptotic\n$\\mathrm{polylog}(n)$-approximation algorithm; it is a true approximation if\nthe makespan also accounts for the time to communicate the jobs to the machines\nand for the time to communicate the results out. For no-duplication schedules,\nwe also obtain an asymptotic $\\mathrm{polylog}(n)$-approximation via a\nreduction to the case with duplication, and a true\n$\\mathrm{polylog}(n)$-approximation for symmetric delays ($\\rho^{\\text{in}}_{i}\n= \\rho^{\\mathrm{out}}_i$ for all machines $i$). These results represent the\nfirst polylogarithmic approximation algorithms for scheduling with non-uniform\ncommunication delays.",

    "abstract": "The aim of change detection (CD) is to detect changes occurred in the same\narea by comparing two images of that place taken at different times. The\nchallenging part of the CD is to keep track of the changes the user wants to\nhighlight, such as new buildings, and to ignore changes due to external factors\nsuch as environmental, lighting condition, fog or seasonal changes. Recent\ndevelopments in the field of deep learning enabled researchers to achieve\noutstanding performance in this area. In particular, different mechanisms of\nspace-time attention allowed to exploit the spatial features that are extracted\nfrom the models and to correlate them also in a temporal way by exploiting both\nthe available images. The downside is that the models have become increasingly\ncomplex and large, often unfeasible for edge applications. These are\nlimitations when the models must be applied to the industrial field or in\napplications requiring real-time performances. In this work we propose a novel\nmodel, called TinyCD, demonstrating to be both lightweight and effective, able\nto achieve performances comparable or even superior to the current state of the\nart with 13-150X fewer parameters. In our approach we have exploited the\nimportance of low-level features to compare images. To do this, we use only few\nbackbone blocks. This strategy allow us to keep the number of network\nparameters low. To compose the features extracted from the two images, we\nintroduce a novel, economical in terms of parameters, mixing block capable of\ncross correlating features in both space and time domains. Finally, to fully\nexploit the information contained in the computed features, we define the\nPW-MLP block able to perform a pixel wise classification.

    "abstract": "In an overloaded FaaS cluster, individual worker nodes strain under\nlengthening queues of requests. Although the cluster might be eventually\nhorizontally-scaled, adding a new node takes dozens of seconds. As serving\napplications are tuned for tail serving latencies, and these greatly increase\nunder heavier loads, the current workaround is resource over-provisioning. In\nfact, even though a service can withstand a steady load of, e.g., 70% CPU\nutilization, the autoscaler is triggered at, e.g., 30-40% (thus the service\nuses twice as many nodes as it would be needed). We propose an alternative: a\nworker-level method handling heavy load without increasing the number of nodes.\nFaaS executions are not interactive, compared to, e.g., text editors:\nend-users do not benefit from the CPU allocated to processes often, yet for\nshort periods. Inspired by scheduling methods for High Performance Computing,\nwe take a radical step of replacing the classic OS preemption by (1) queuing\nrequests based on their historical characteristics; (2) once a request is being\nprocessed, setting its CPU limit to exactly one core (with no CPU\noversubscription).\nWe extend OpenWhisk and measure the efficiency of the proposed solutions\nusing the SeBS benchmark. In a loaded system, our method decreases the average\nresponse time by a factor of 4. The improvement is even higher for shorter\nrequests, as the average stretch is decreased by a factor of 18.

In our model, co-authors can issued an ultimatum to pause the\npublication of the manuscript until the underlying issue has been resolved. We\nmodeled the effect of issuing one or more ultimatums and showed that they have\na major impact on the ultimate number and position of co-authors and the length\nof the publication process. In addition, we explored the effect of two common\nrelationships (student-advisor and colleague-colleague) on co-authorship\nscenarios. The results of our model are alarming and suggest that the current\nacademic practices are not fit for purpose. Where they work, they work because\nof the integrity of researchers and not by a systematic design.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the high complexity of the business environment, dynamism\nand environmental change, uncertainty and concepts such as globalization and\nincreasing competition of organizations in the national and international arena\nhave caused many changes in the equations governing the supply chain. In this\ncase, supply chain organizations must always be prepared for a variety of\nchallenges and dynamic environmental changes. One of the effective solutions to\nface these challenges is to create a resilient supply chain. Resilient supply\nchain is able to overcome uncertainties and disruptions in the business\nenvironment. The competitive advantage of this supply chain does not depend\nonly on low costs, high quality, reduced latency and high level of service.\nRather, it has the ability of the chain to avoid catastrophes and overcome\ncritical situations, and this is the resilience of the supply chain. AI and IoT\ntechnologies and their combination, called AIoT, have played a key role in\nimproving supply chain performance in recent years and can therefore increase\nsupply chain resilience. For this reason, in this study, an attempt was made to\nbetter understand the impact of these technologies on equity by examining the\ndimensions and components of the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT)-based\nsupply chain. Finally, using nonlinear fuzzy decision making method, the most\nimportant components of the impact on the resilient smart supply chain are\ndetermined. Understanding this assessment can help empower the smart supply\nchain.",

    "abstract": "What sorts of structure might enable a learner to discover classes from\nunlabeled data? Traditional approaches rely on feature-space similarity and\nheroic assumptions on the data. In this paper, we introduce unsupervised\nlearning under Latent Label Shift (LLS), where we have access to unlabeled data\nfrom multiple domains such that the label marginals $p_d(y)$ can shift across\ndomains but the class conditionals $p(\\mathbf{x}|y)$ do not. This work\ninstantiates a new principle for identifying classes: elements that shift\ntogether group together. For finite input spaces, we establish an isomorphism\nbetween LLS and topic modeling: inputs correspond to words, domains to\ndocuments, and labels to topics. Addressing continuous data, we prove that when\neach label's support contains a separable region, analogous to an anchor word,\noracle access to $p(d|\\mathbf{x})$ suffices to identify $p_d(y)$ and\n$p_d(y|\\mathbf{x})$ up to permutation. Thus motivated, we introduce a practical\nalgorithm that leverages domain-discriminative models as follows: (i) push\nexamples through domain discriminator $p(d|\\mathbf{x})$; (ii) discretize the\ndata by clustering examples in $p(d|\\mathbf{x})$ space; (iii) perform\nnon-negative matrix factorization on the discrete data; (iv) combine the\nrecovered $p(y|d)$ with the discriminator outputs $p(d|\\mathbf{x})$ to compute\n$p_d(y|x) \\; \\forall d$. With semi-synthetic experiments, we show that our\nalgorithm can leverage domain information to improve state of the art\nunsupervised classification methods. We reveal a failure mode of standard\nunsupervised classification methods when feature-space similarity does not\nindicate true groupings, and show empirically that our method better handles\nthis case. Our results establish a deep connection between distribution shift\nand topic modeling, opening promising lines for future work.",

    "abstract": "Recently, adversarial machine learning attacks have posed serious security\nthreats against practical audio signal classification systems, including speech\nrecognition, speaker recognition, and music copyright detection. Previous\nstudies have mainly focused on ensuring the effectiveness of attacking an audio\nsignal classifier via creating a small noise-like perturbation on the original\nsignal. It is still unclear if an attacker is able to create audio signal\nperturbations that can be well perceived by human beings in addition to its\nattack effectiveness. This is particularly important for music signals as they\nare carefully crafted with human-enjoyable audio characteristics.\nIn this work, we formulate the adversarial attack against music signals as a\nnew perception-aware attack framework, which integrates human study into\nadversarial attack design. Specifically, we conduct a human study to quantify\nthe human perception with respect to a change of a music signal. We invite\nhuman participants to rate their perceived deviation based on pairs of original\nand perturbed music signals, and reverse-engineer the human perception process\nby regression analysis to predict the human-perceived deviation given a\nperturbed signal. The perception-aware attack is then formulated as an\noptimization problem that finds an optimal perturbation signal to minimize the\nprediction of perceived deviation from the regressed human perception model. We\nuse the perception-aware framework to design a realistic adversarial music\nattack against YouTube's copyright detector. Experiments show that the\nperception-aware attack produces adversarial music with significantly better\nperceptual quality than prior work.",

The inclusion\nof jerk and yaw rate references through an angular velocity feedforward term\nimproves tracking of trajectories with fast-changing accelerations. The\ncontroller does not depend on extensive aerodynamic modeling but instead uses\nincremental nonlinear dynamic inversion (INDI) to compute control updates based\non only a local input-output relation, resulting in robustness against\ndiscrepancies in the simplified aerodynamics equations. Exact inversion of the\nnonlinear input-output relation is achieved through the derived flatness\ntransform.

    "title": "Point-McBert: A Multi-choice Self-supervised Framework for Point Cloud  Pre-training",
    "abstract": "Masked language modeling (MLM) has become one of the most successful\nself-supervised pre-training task. Inspired by its success, Point-Bert, as a\npioneer work in point cloud, proposed masked point modeling (MPM) to pre-train\npoint transformer on large scale unanotated dataset. Despite its great\nperformance, we find inherent difference between language and point cloud tends\nto cause ambiguous tokenization for point cloud. For point cloud, there doesn't\nexist a gold standard for point cloud tokenization. Although Point-Bert\nintroduce a discrete Variational AutoEncoder (dVAE) as tokenizer to allocate\ntoken ids to local patches, it tends to generate ambigious token ids for local\npatches. We find this imperfect tokenizer might generate different token ids\nfor semantically-similar patches and same token ids for semantically-dissimilar\npatches. To tackle above problem, we propose our Point-McBert, a pre-training\nframework with eased and refined supervision signals. Specifically, we ease the\nprevious single-choice constraint on patches, and provide multi-choice token\nids for each patch as supervision. Moreover, we utilitze the high-level\nsemantics learned by transformer to further refine our supervision signals.\nExtensive experiments on point cloud classification, few-shot classification\nand part segmentation tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method, e.g.,\nthe pre-trained transformer achieves 94.1% accuracy on ModelNet40, 84.28%\naccuracy on the hardest setting of ScanObjectNN and new state-of-the-art\nperformance on few-shot learning. We also demonstrate that our method not only\nimproves the performance of Point-Bert on all downstream tasks, but also incurs\nalmost no extra computational overhead.",

    "abstract": "The Unlimited Sensing Framework (USF) is a digital acquisition protocol that\nallows for sampling and reconstruction of high dynamic range signals. By\nacquiring modulo samples, the USF circumvents the clipping or saturation\nproblem that is a fundamental bottleneck in conventional analog-to-digital\nconverters (ADCs). In the context of the USF, several works have focused on\nbandlimited function classes and recently, a hardware validation of the modulo\nsampling approach has been presented. In a different direction, in this paper\nwe focus on non-bandlimited function classes and consider the well-known\nsuper-resolution problem; we study the recovery of sparse signals (Dirac\nimpulses) from low-pass filtered, modulo samples. Taking an end-to-end approach\nto USF based super-resolution, we present a novel recovery algorithm (US-SR)\nthat leverages a doubly sparse structure of the modulo samples.

Different from existing works, we use a one-sided generative\nmodel and add a weighted patch-wise contrastive loss between sampled patches of\nthe input image and the corresponding synthetic image, which serves as shape\nconstraints. Moreover, we notice that the generated images and input images\nshare similar structural information but are in different modalities.

The aim of this\nwork is to suggest architectures that inherit the computational efficiency and\nscalability of Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) and the distributed\nnature of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). In this\ndirection, two frameworks are introduced. The first one called Nested\nDistributed DDP (ND-DDP), is a three-level architecture which employs ADMM for\nenforcing a consensus between all agents, an Augmented Lagrangian layer for\nsatisfying local constraints and DDP as each agent's optimizer. In the second\napproach, both consensus and local constraints are handled with ADMM, yielding\na two-level architecture called Merged Distributed DDP (MD-DDP), which further\nreduces computational complexity. Both frameworks are fully decentralized since\nall computations are parallelizable among the agents and only local\ncommunication is necessary. Simulation results that scale up to thousands of\nvehicles and hundreds of drones verify the effectiveness of the methods.\nSuperior scalability to large-scale systems against centralized DDP and\ncentralized/decentralized sequential quadratic programming is also illustrated.\nFinally, hardware experiments on a multi-robot platform demonstrate the\napplicability of the proposed algorithms, while highlighting the importance of\noptimizing for feedback policies to increase robustness against uncertainty.

For 3D video-based tasks such as action recognition,\nhowever, directly applying spatiotemporal transformers on video data will bring\nheavy computation and memory burdens due to the largely increased number of\npatches and the quadratic complexity of self-attention computation. How to\nefficiently and effectively model the 3D self-attention of video data has been\na great challenge for transformers. In this paper, we propose a Temporal Patch\nShift (TPS) method for efficient 3D self-attention modeling in transformers for\nvideo-based action recognition. TPS shifts part of patches with a specific\nmosaic pattern in the temporal dimension, thus converting a vanilla spatial\nself-attention operation to a spatiotemporal one with little additional cost.\nAs a result, we can compute 3D self-attention using nearly the same computation\nand memory cost as 2D self-attention.

Moreover, the\ntimespan between interacted items is not sufficiently utilized by previous\nmodels, restricting SR performance gains. To address these problems, we propose\na novel SR system employing a hierarchical graph neural network (HGNN) to model\nfactorial user preferences. Specifically, a timespan-aware sequence graph (TSG)\nfor the target user is first constructed with the timespan among interacted\nitems. Next, all original nodes in TSG are softly clustered into factor nodes,\neach of which represents a certain factor of the user's preference. At last,\nall factor nodes' representations are used together to predict SR results. Our\nextensive experiments upon two datasets justify that our HGNN-based factorial\nuser modeling obtains better SR performance than the state-of-the-art SR\nmodels.",

    "abstract": "In many robotic applications, the environment setting in which the 6-DoF pose\nestimation of a known, rigid object and its subsequent grasping is to be\nperformed, remains nearly unchanging and might even be known to the robot in\nadvance. In this paper, we refer to this problem as instance-specific pose\nestimation: the robot is expected to estimate the pose with a high degree of\naccuracy in only a limited set of familiar scenarios. Minor changes in the\nscene, including variations in lighting conditions and background appearance,\nare acceptable but drastic alterations are not anticipated. To this end, we\npresent a method to rapidly train and deploy a pipeline for estimating the\ncontinuous 6-DoF pose of an object from a single RGB image. The key idea is to\nleverage known camera poses and rigid body geometry to partially automate the\ngeneration of a large labeled dataset. The dataset, along with sufficient\ndomain randomization, is then used to supervise the training of deep neural\nnetworks for predicting semantic keypoints. Experimentally, we demonstrate the\nconvenience and effectiveness of our proposed method to accurately estimate\nobject pose requiring only a very small amount of manual annotation for\ntraining.",

However, time being consumed in training the\nDNN is excessive, and explainability analysis for the FDC neural network is\nstill underwhelming. A concept known as imagefication-based intelligent FDC has\nbeen studied in recent years. This concept advocates to stack the sensors\nmeasurement data into an image format, the sensors FDC issue is then\ntransformed to abnormal regions detection problem on the stacked image, which\nmay well borrow the recent advances in the machine vision vision realm.\nAlthough promising results have been claimed in the imagefication-based\nintelligent FDC researches, due to the low size of the stacked image, small\nconvolutional kernels and shallow DNN layers were used, which hinders the FDC\nperformance. In this paper, we first propose a data augmentation method which\ninflates the stacked image to a larger size (correspondent to the VGG16 net\ndeveloped in the machine vision realm). The FDC neural network is then trained\nvia fine-tuning the VGG16 directly. To truncate and compress the FDC net size\n(hence its running time), we perform model pruning on the fine-tuned net. Class\nactivation mapping (CAM) method is also adopted for explainability analysis of\nthe FDC net to verify its internal operations. Via data augmentation,\nfine-tuning from VGG16, and model pruning, the FDC net developed in this paper\nclaims an FDC accuracy 98.90% across 4 aircraft at 5 flight conditions (running\ntime 26 ms).

To generate high fidelity\nvectorized floorplans, we propose a novel two-stage framework, including a\ndraft stage and a multi-round refining stage. In the first stage, we encode the\nroom connectivity graph input by users with a graph convolutional network\n(GCN), then apply an autoregressive transformer network to generate an initial\nfloorplan sequence. To polish the initial design and generate more visually\nappealing floorplans, we further propose a novel panoptic refinement\nnetwork(PRN) composed of a GCN and a transformer network. The PRN takes the\ninitial generated sequence as input and refines the floorplan design while\nencouraging the correct room connectivity with our proposed geometric loss.

The shortest addition chain is one of the most\nimportant mathematical concepts to realize the optimization. However, finding a\nshortest addition chain of length k is an NP-hard problem, whose time\ncomplexity is comparable to O($k!$). This paper proposes some novel methods to\ngenerate short addition chains.

Moreover, a\nCross Window method and its variant are introduced by improving the Window\nmethod. More precisely, the Cross Window method uses the cross correlation to\ndeal with the windows and its pre-computation is optimized by the Addition\nSequence algorithm. The theoretical analysis is conducted to show the\ncorrectness and effectiveness. Meanwhile, the experiment shows that the new\nmethods can obtain shorter addition chains compared to the existing methods.\nThe Cross Window method with the Addition Sequence algorithm can attain 9.5%\nreduction of the addition chain length, in the best case, compared to the\nWindow method.",

This is a difficult scheduling problem\nthat requires handling multiple scheduling dimensions, and variations in\nresource usage and availability. In practice, system designers manually tune\nparameters for their specific hardware and application, which results in poor\ngeneralization and increases the development burden. In this work, we highlight\nthe emerging need for scheduling CPU resources at runtime in sense-react\nsystems. We study three canonical applications (face tracking, robot\nnavigation, and VR) to first understand the key scheduling requirements for\nsuch systems. Armed with this understanding, we develop a scheduling framework,\nCatan, that dynamically schedules compute resources across different components\nof an app so as to meet the specified application requirements. Through\nexperiments with a prototype implemented on a widely-used robotics framework\n(ROS) and an open-source AR/VR platform, we show the impact of system\nscheduling on meeting the performance goals for the three applications, how\nCatan is able to achieve better application performance than hand-tuned\nconfigurations, and how it dynamically adapts to runtime variations.",

The only known result in this direction prior to this\nwork is the quadratic Goldreich-Levin theorem, proved by Tulsiani and Wolf in\n2011.

However, for decentralized bilevel optimization over peer-to-peer\nnetworks with limited computation and communication capabilities, how to\nachieve low sample and communication complexities are two fundamental\nchallenges that remain under-explored so far. In this paper, we make the first\nattempt to investigate the class of decentralized bilevel optimization problems\nwith nonconvex and strongly-convex structure corresponding to the outer and\ninner subproblems, respectively. Our main contributions in this paper are\ntwo-fold: i) We first propose a deterministic algorithm called INTERACT\n(inner-gradient-descent-outer-tracked-gradient) that requires the sample\ncomplexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n \\epsilon^{-1})$ and communication complexity of\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-1})$ to solve the bilevel optimization problem, where\n$n$ and $\\epsilon > 0$ are the number of samples at each agent and the desired\nstationarity gap, respectively. ii) To relax the need for full gradient\nevaluations in each iteration, we propose a stochastic variance-reduced version\nof INTERACT (SVR-INTERACT), which improves the sample complexity to\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{n} \\epsilon^{-1})$ while achieving the same communication\ncomplexity as the deterministic algorithm.

Many imputation methods have been\nproposed to address this problem of data incompleteness or sparsity. However,\nthe accuracy of a data imputation method for a given feature or a set of\nfeatures in a dataset is highly dependent on the distribution of the feature\nvalues and its correlation with other features. Another problem that plagues\nindustry deployments of machine learning (ML) solutions is concept drift\ndetection, which becomes more challenging in the presence of missing values.\nAlthough data imputation and concept drift detection have been studied\nextensively, little work has attempted a combined study of the two phenomena,\ni.e., concept drift detection in the presence of sparsity. In this work, we\ncarry out a systematic study of the following: (i) different patterns of\nmissing values, (ii) various statistical and ML based data imputation methods\nfor different kinds of sparsity, (iii) several concept drift detection methods,\n(iv) practical analysis of the various drift detection metrics, (v) selecting\nthe best concept drift detector given a dataset with missing values based on\nthe different metrics. We first analyze it on synthetic data and publicly\navailable datasets, and finally extend the findings to our deployed solution of\nautomated change risk assessment system. One of the major findings from our\nempirical study is the absence of supremacy of any one concept drift detection\nmethod across all the relevant metrics.

    "title": "Is Attention All NeRF Needs?",
    "abstract": "We present Generalizable NeRF Transformer (GNT), a pure, unified\ntransformer-based architecture that efficiently reconstructs Neural Radiance\nFields (NeRFs) on the fly from source views. Unlike prior works on NeRF that\noptimize a per-scene implicit representation by inverting a handcrafted\nrendering equation, GNT achieves generalizable neural scene representation and\nrendering, by encapsulating two transformer-based stages. The first stage of\nGNT, called view transformer, leverages multi-view geometry as an inductive\nbias for attention-based scene representation, and predicts coordinate-aligned\nfeatures by aggregating information from epipolar lines on the neighboring\nviews. The second stage of GNT, named ray transformer, renders novel views by\nray marching and directly decodes the sequence of sampled point features using\nthe attention mechanism. Our experiments demonstrate that when optimized on a\nsingle scene, GNT can successfully reconstruct NeRF without explicit rendering\nformula, and even improve the PSNR by ~1.3dB on complex scenes due to the\nlearnable ray renderer. When trained across various scenes, GNT consistently\nachieves the state-of-the-art performance when transferring to forward-facing\nLLFF dataset (LPIPS ~20%, SSIM ~25%$) and synthetic blender dataset (LPIPS\n~20%, SSIM ~4%). In addition, we show that depth and occlusion can be inferred\nfrom the learned attention maps, which implies that the pure attention\nmechanism is capable of learning a physically-grounded rendering process. All\nthese results bring us one step closer to the tantalizing hope of utilizing\ntransformers as the \"universal modeling tool\" even for graphics.

Methods for visual explanation such as Grad-CAM usually generate\nblurry maps which are not intuitive for humans to understand, particularly in\nrecognizing actions of people in videos. Our proposed method, Object-ABN,\ntackles this issue by introducing a new mask loss that makes the generated\nattention maps close to the instance segmentation result. Further the PC loss\nand multiple attention maps are introduced to enhance the sharpness of the maps\nand improve the performance of classification. Experimental results with UCF101\nand SSv2 shows that the generated maps by the proposed method are much clearer\nqualitatively and quantitatively than those of the original ABN.",

The goal of FedSA is to train a\nstudent model for a new task with the help of several decentralized teachers,\nwhose pre-training tasks and data are different and agnostic. Our motivation\nfor investigating such a problem setup stems from a recent dilemma of model\nsharing. Many researchers or institutes have spent enormous resources on\ntraining large and competent networks. Due to the privacy, security, or\nintellectual property issues, they are, however, not able to share their own\npre-trained models, even if they wish to contribute to the community. The\nproposed FedSA offers a solution to this dilemma and makes it one step further\nsince, again, the learned student may specialize in a new task different from\nall of the teachers. To this end, we proposed a dedicated strategy for handling\nFedSA. Specifically, our student-training process is driven by a novel\nsaliency-based approach that adaptively selects teachers as the participants\nand integrates their representative capabilities into the student. To evaluate\nthe effectiveness of FedSA, we conduct experiments on both single-task and\nmulti-task settings. Experimental results demonstrate that FedSA effectively\namalgamates knowledge from decentralized models and achieves competitive\nperformance to centralized baselines.",

    "abstract": "We propose a task we name Portrait Interpretation and construct a dataset\nnamed Portrait250K for it. Current researches on portraits such as human\nattribute recognition and person re-identification have achieved many\nsuccesses, but generally, they: 1) may lack mining the interrelationship\nbetween various tasks and the possible benefits it may bring; 2) design deep\nmodels specifically for each task, which is inefficient; 3) may be unable to\ncope with the needs of a unified model and comprehensive perception in actual\nscenes. In this paper, the proposed portrait interpretation recognizes the\nperception of humans from a new systematic perspective. We divide the\nperception of portraits into three aspects, namely Appearance, Posture, and\nEmotion, and design corresponding sub-tasks for each aspect. Based on the\nframework of multi-task learning, portrait interpretation requires a\ncomprehensive description of static attributes and dynamic states of portraits.\nTo invigorate research on this new task, we construct a new dataset that\ncontains 250,000 images labeled with identity, gender, age, physique, height,\nexpression, and posture of the whole body and arms. Our dataset is collected\nfrom 51 movies, hence covering extensive diversity. Furthermore, we focus on\nrepresentation learning for portrait interpretation and propose a baseline that\nreflects our systematic perspective. We also propose an appropriate metric for\nthis task. Our experimental results demonstrate that combining the tasks\nrelated to portrait interpretation can yield benefits. Code and dataset will be\nmade public.",

    "title": "NICEST: Noisy Label Correction and Training for Robust Scene Graph  Generation",
    "abstract": "Nearly all existing scene graph generation (SGG) models have overlooked the\nground-truth annotation qualities of mainstream SGG datasets, i.e., they\nassume: 1) all the manually annotated positive samples are equally correct; 2)\nall the un-annotated negative samples are absolutely background. In this paper,\nwe argue that neither of the assumptions applies to SGG: there are numerous\nnoisy ground-truth predicate labels that break these two assumptions and harm\nthe training of unbiased SGG models. To this end, we propose a novel NoIsy\nlabel CorrEction and Sample Training strategy for SGG: NICEST. Specifically, it\nconsists of two parts: NICE and NIST, which rule out these noisy label issues\nby generating high-quality samples and the effective training strategy,\nrespectively. NICE first detects noisy samples and then reassigns them more\nhigh-quality soft predicate labels. NIST is a multi-teacher knowledge\ndistillation based training strategy, which enables the model to learn unbiased\nfusion knowledge. And a dynamic trade-off weighting strategy in NIST is\ndesigned to penalize the bias of different teachers. Due to the model-agnostic\nnature of both NICE and NIST, our NICEST can be seamlessly incorporated into\nany SGG architecture to boost its performance on different predicate\ncategories. In addition, to better evaluate the generalization of SGG models,\nwe further propose a new benchmark VG-OOD, by re-organizing the prevalent VG\ndataset and deliberately making the predicate distributions of the training and\ntest sets as different as possible for each subject-object category pair. This\nnew benchmark helps disentangle the influence of subject-object category based\nfrequency biases. Extensive ablations and results on different backbones and\ntasks have attested to the effectiveness and generalization ability of each\ncomponent of NICEST.",

However, is the\nlocality achieved by the micro-level CNNs embedded in ViTs good enough? In this\npaper, we investigate the problem by profoundly exploring how the macro\narchitecture of the hybrid CNNs/ViTs enhances the performances of hierarchical\nViTs. Particularly, we study the role of token embedding layers, alias\nconvolutional embedding (CE), and systemically reveal how CE injects desirable\ninductive bias in ViTs. Besides, we apply the optimal CE configuration to 4\nrecently released state-of-the-art ViTs, effectively boosting the corresponding\nperformances. Finally, a family of efficient hybrid CNNs/ViTs, dubbed CETNets,\nare released, which may serve as generic vision backbones. Specifically,\nCETNets achieve 84.9% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K (training from scratch),\n48.6% box mAP on the COCO benchmark, and 51.6% mIoU on the ADE20K,\nsubstantially improving the performances of the corresponding state-of-the-art\nbaselines.",

Although existing 3D attack methods achieve high success rates, they\ndelve into the data space with point-wise perturbation, which may neglect the\ngeometric characteristics. Instead, we propose point cloud attacks from a new\nperspective -- the graph spectral domain attack, aiming to perturb graph\ntransform coefficients in the spectral domain that corresponds to varying\ncertain geometric structure. Specifically, leveraging on graph signal\nprocessing, we first adaptively transform the coordinates of points onto the\nspectral domain via graph Fourier transform (GFT) for compact representation.\nThen, we analyze the influence of different spectral bands on the geometric\nstructure, based on which we propose to perturb the GFT coefficients via a\nlearnable graph spectral filter. Considering the low-frequency components\nmainly contribute to the rough shape of the 3D object, we further introduce a\nlow-frequency constraint to limit perturbations within imperceptible\nhigh-frequency components. Finally, the adversarial point cloud is generated by\ntransforming the perturbed spectral representation back to the data domain via\nthe inverse GFT.

    "abstract": "We introduce RealTime QA, a dynamic question answering (QA) platform that\nannounces questions and evaluates systems on a regular basis (weekly in this\nversion). RealTime QA inquires about the current world, and QA systems need to\nanswer questions about novel events or information. It therefore challenges\nstatic, conventional assumptions in open domain QA datasets and pursues,\ninstantaneous applications. We build strong baseline models upon large\npretrained language models, including GPT-3 and T5. Our benchmark is an ongoing\neffort, and this preliminary report presents real-time evaluation results over\nthe past month. Our experimental results show that GPT-3 can often properly\nupdate its generation results, based on newly-retrieved documents, highlighting\nthe importance of up-to-date information retrieval. Nonetheless, we find that\nGPT-3 tends to return outdated answers when retrieved documents do not provide\nsufficient information to find an answer. This suggests an important avenue for\nfuture research: can an open domain QA system identify such unanswerable cases\nand communicate with the user or even the retrieval module to modify the\nretrieval results? We hope that RealTime QA will spur progress in instantaneous\napplications of question answering and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Active learning is an important technology for automated machine learning\nsystems. In contrast to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) which aims at\nautomating neural network architecture design, active learning aims at\nautomating training data selection. It is especially critical for training a\nlong-tailed task, in which positive samples are sparsely distributed. Active\nlearning alleviates the expensive data annotation issue through incrementally\ntraining models powered with efficient data selection. Instead of annotating\nall unlabeled samples, it iteratively selects and annotates the most valuable\nsamples. Active learning has been popular in image classification, but has not\nbeen fully explored in object detection. Most of current approaches on object\ndetection are evaluated with different settings, making it difficult to fairly\ncompare their performance. To facilitate the research in this field, this paper\ncontributes an active learning benchmark framework named as ALBench for\nevaluating active learning in object detection. Developed on an automatic deep\nmodel training system, this ALBench framework is easy-to-use, compatible with\ndifferent active learning algorithms, and ensures the same training and testing\nprotocols. We hope this automated benchmark system help researchers to easily\nreproduce literature's performance and have objective comparisons with prior\narts. The code will be release through Github.",

To mitigate this issue, we propose to incorporate an auxiliary\npoint-selective network into a meta-learning framework, called PointFix, to\nprovide a robust initialization of stereo models for online stereo adaptation.\nIn a nutshell, our auxiliary network learns to fix local variants intensively\nby effectively back-propagating local information through the meta-gradient for\nthe robust initialization of the baseline model. This network is\nmodel-agnostic, so can be used in any kind of architectures in a plug-and-play\nmanner. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our\nmethod under three adaptation settings such as short-, mid-, and long-term\nsequences.

We use the deep\nconvolutional neural network YOLOv4 as a detector. For particular\nrepresentations, we obtain a detection accuracy in the range of 86.9-88.9%\nmAP@0.5. The use of a fusion of the considered representations allows us to\nobtain a detector with higher accuracy of 89.9% mAP@0.5.

In this context, popular social media users play a major role, as\nthey have the ability to broadcast messages to large audiences, thus\ninfluencing public opinion. We make use of publicly available Twitter data to\nstudy the behavior of influential users discussing the pandemic, whom we term\nCOVID-19 Twitter elites. We tackle the issue from a network perspective, by\nconsidering users as nodes and following relationships as directed edges. The\nresulting network structure is modeled by embedding the actors in a latent\nsocial space, where users closer to one another have a higher probability of\nforming edges. The results suggest the existence of two distinct communities,\nwhich can be interpreted as \"generally pro\" and \"generally against\" vaccine\nmandates. We further focus on a number of exposed users, such as politicians,\nactivists, and news outlets, and discuss their roles in the latent space. Our\nfindings show that the full spectrum of beliefs between the two poles is\nrepresented, with more radical users positioned towards the extremes of the\nspace, and more moderate actors in the middle. Our analysis demonstrates how it\nis possible to provide a nuanced representation of the COVID-19 Twitter\necosystem by only considering follows within the network of elites.

Even DRAM maintenance operations, which\nare used to ensure correct operation (e.g., refresh) and combat\nreliability/security issues of DRAM (e.g., RowHammer), are managed by the\nmemory controller. Thus, implementing new maintenance operations or modifying\nthe existing ones often require difficult-to-realize changes in the DRAM\ninterface, memory controller, and potentially other system components (e.g.,\nsystem software), leading to slow progress in DRAM-based systems.\nIn this paper, our goal is to 1) ease the process of enabling new DRAM\nmaintenance operations and 2) enable more efficient in-DRAM maintenance\noperations. Our idea is to set the memory controller free from managing DRAM\nmaintenance. To this end, we propose Self-Managing DRAM (SMD), a new low-cost\nDRAM architecture that enables implementing new in-DRAM maintenance mechanisms\n(or modifying old ones) with no further changes in the DRAM interface, memory\ncontroller, or other system components. We use SMD to implement new in-DRAM\nmaintenance mechanisms for three use cases: 1) periodic refresh, 2) RowHammer\nprotection, and 3) memory scrubbing. Our evaluations show that SMD-based\nmaintenance operations significantly improve the system performance and energy\nefficiency while providing higher reliability compared to conventional DDR4\nDRAM. A combination of SMD-based maintenance mechanisms that perform refresh,\nRowHammer protection, and memory scrubbing achieve 7.6% speedup and consume\n5.2% less DRAM energy on average across 20 memory-intensive four-core\nworkloads.",

    "abstract": "Recently, haptic gloves have been extensively explored for various practical\napplications, such as manipulation learning. Previous glove devices have\ndifferent force-driven systems, such as shape memory alloys, servo motors and\npneumatic actuators; however, these proposed devices may have difficulty in\nfast finger movement, easy reproduction, and safety issues. In this study, we\npropose MagGlove, a novel haptic glove with a movable magnet mechanism that has\na linear motor, to solve these issues. The proposed MagGlove device is a\ncompact system on the back of the wearer's hand with high responsiveness, ease\nof use, and good safety. The proposed device is adaptive with the modification\nof the magnitude of the current flowing through the coil. Based on our\nevaluation study, it is verified that the proposed device can achieve finger\nmotion in the given tasks. Therefore, MagGlove can provide flexible support\ntailored to the wearers' learning levels in manipulation learning tasks.",

    "abstract": "Video deblurring is a highly under-constrained problem due to the spatially\nand temporally varying blur. An intuitive approach for video deblurring\nincludes two steps: a) detecting the blurry region in the current frame; b)\nutilizing the information from clear regions in adjacent frames for current\nframe deblurring. To realize this process, our idea is to detect the pixel-wise\nblur level of each frame and combine it with video deblurring. To this end, we\npropose a novel framework that utilizes the motion magnitude prior (MMP) as\nguidance for efficient deep video deblurring. Specifically, as the pixel\nmovement along its trajectory during the exposure time is positively correlated\nto the level of motion blur, we first use the average magnitude of optical flow\nfrom the high-frequency sharp frames to generate the synthetic blurry frames\nand their corresponding pixel-wise motion magnitude maps. We then build a\ndataset including the blurry frame and MMP pairs. The MMP is then learned by a\ncompact CNN by regression. The MMP consists of both spatial and temporal blur\nlevel information, which can be further integrated into an efficient recurrent\nneural network (RNN) for video deblurring. We conduct intensive experiments to\nvalidate the effectiveness of the proposed methods on the public datasets.",

    "title": "Identifying Hard Noise in Long-Tailed Sample Distribution",
    "abstract": "Conventional de-noising methods rely on the assumption that all samples are\nindependent and identically distributed, so the resultant classifier, though\ndisturbed by noise, can still easily identify the noises as the outliers of\ntraining distribution. However, the assumption is unrealistic in large-scale\ndata that is inevitably long-tailed. Such imbalanced training data makes a\nclassifier less discriminative for the tail classes, whose previously \"easy\"\nnoises are now turned into \"hard\" ones -- they are almost as outliers as the\nclean tail samples. We introduce this new challenge as Noisy Long-Tailed\nClassification (NLT). Not surprisingly, we find that most de-noising methods\nfail to identify the hard noises, resulting in significant performance drop on\nthe three proposed NLT benchmarks: ImageNet-NLT, Animal10-NLT, and Food101-NLT.\nTo this end, we design an iterative noisy learning framework called\nHard-to-Easy (H2E). Our bootstrapping philosophy is to first learn a classifier\nas noise identifier invariant to the class and context distributional changes,\nreducing \"hard\" noises to \"easy\" ones, whose removal further improves the\ninvariance. Experimental results show that our H2E outperforms state-of-the-art\nde-noising methods and their ablations on long-tailed settings while\nmaintaining a stable performance on the conventional balanced settings.\nDatasets and codes are available at https://github.com/yxymessi/H2E-Framework",

    "abstract": "One of the oldest and most studied subject in scientific computing is\nalgorithms for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). A long list of\nnumerical methods have been proposed and successfully used for various\napplications. In recent years, deep learning methods have shown their\nsuperiority for high-dimensional PDEs where traditional methods fail. However,\nfor low dimensional problems, it remains unclear whether these methods have a\nreal advantage over traditional algorithms as a direct solver. In this work, we\npropose the random feature method (RFM) for solving PDEs, a natural bridge\nbetween traditional and machine learning-based algorithms. RFM is based on a\ncombination of well-known ideas: 1. representation of the approximate solution\nusing random feature functions; 2. collocation method to take care of the PDE;\n3. the penalty method to treat the boundary conditions, which allows us to\ntreat the boundary condition and the PDE in the same footing. We find it\ncrucial to add several additional components including multi-scale\nrepresentation and rescaling the weights in the loss function. We demonstrate\nthat the method exhibits spectral accuracy and can compete with traditional\nsolvers in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we find that RFM\nis particularly suited for complex problems with complex geometry, where both\ntraditional and machine learning-based algorithms encounter difficulties.",

    "abstract": "Greybox fuzzing is the de-facto standard to discover bugs during development.\nFuzzers execute many inputs to maximize the amount of reached code. Recently,\nDirected Greybox Fuzzers (DGFs) propose an alternative strategy that goes\nbeyond \"just\" coverage: driving testing toward specific code targets by\nselecting \"closer\" seeds. DGFs go through different phases: exploration (i.e.,\nreaching interesting locations) and exploitation (i.e., triggering bugs). In\npractice, DGFs leverage coverage to directly measure exploration, while\nexploitation is, at best, measured indirectly by alternating between different\ntargets. Specifically, we observe two limitations in existing DGFs: (i) they\nlack precision in their distance metric, i.e., averaging multiple paths and\ntargets into a single score (to decide which seeds to prioritize), and (ii)\nthey assign energy to seeds in a round-robin fashion without adjusting the\npriority of the targets (exhaustively explored targets should be dropped).\nWe propose FishFuzz, which draws inspiration from trawl fishing: first\ncasting a wide net, scraping for high coverage, then slowly pulling it in to\nmaximize the harvest. The core of our fuzzer is a novel seed selection strategy\nthat builds on two concepts: (i) a novel multi-distance metric whose precision\nis independent of the number of targets, and (ii) a dynamic target ranking to\nautomatically discard exhausted targets. This strategy allows FishFuzz to\nseamlessly scale to tens of thousands of targets and dynamically alternate\nbetween exploration and exploitation phases. We evaluate FishFuzz by leveraging\nall sanitizer labels as targets. Extensively comparing FishFuzz against modern\nDGFs and coverage-guided fuzzers shows that FishFuzz reached higher coverage\ncompared to the direct competitors, reproduces existing bugs (70.2% faster),\nand finally discovers 25 new bugs (18 CVEs) in 44 programs.",

In this paper, we propose Trans-Norm, a novel deep\nsegmentation framework which concomitantly consolidates a Transformer module\ninto both encoder and skip-connections of the standard U-Net. We argue that the\nexpedient design of skip-connections can be crucial for accurate segmentation\nas it can assist in feature fusion between the expanding and contracting paths.\nIn this respect, we derive a Spatial Normalization mechanism from the\nTransformer module to adaptively recalibrate the skip connection path.\nExtensive experiments across three typical tasks for medical image segmentation\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of TransNorm.

    "abstract": "This paper presents an optimization based framework to automate system repair\nagainst omega-regular properties. In the proposed formalization of optimal\nrepair, the systems are represented as Kripke structures, the properties as\n$\\omega$-regular languages, and the repair space as repair machines -- weighted\nomega-regular transducers equipped with B\\\"uchi conditions -- that rewrite\nstrings and associate a cost sequence to these rewritings. To translate the\nresulting cost-sequences to easily interpretable payoffs, we consider several\naggregator functions to map cost sequences to numbers -- including limit\nsuperior, supremum, discounted-sum, and average-sum -- to define quantitative\ncost semantics. The problem of optimal repair, then, is to determine whether\ntraces from a given system can be rewritten to satisfy an $\\omega$-regular\nproperty when the allowed cost is bounded by a given threshold. We also\nconsider the dual challenge of impair verification that assumes that the\nrewritings are resolved adversarially under some given cost restriction, and\nasks to decide if all traces of the system satisfy the specification\nirrespective of the rewritings. With a negative result to the impair\nverification problem, we study the problem of designing a minimal mask of the\nKripke structure such that the resulting traces satisfy the specifications\ndespite the threshold-bounded impairment. We dub this problem as the mask\nsynthesis problem. This paper presents automata-theoretic solutions to repair\nsynthesis, impair verification, and mask synthesis problem for limit superior,\nsupremum, discounted-sum, and average-sum cost semantics.",

    "abstract": "The security of deep neural networks (DNNs) has attracted increasing\nattention due to their widespread use in various applications. Recently, the\ndeployed DNNs have been demonstrated to be vulnerable to Trojan attacks, which\nmanipulate model parameters with bit flips to inject a hidden behavior and\nactivate it by a specific trigger pattern. However, all existing Trojan attacks\nadopt noticeable patch-based triggers (e.g., a square pattern), making them\nperceptible to humans and easy to be spotted by machines. In this paper, we\npresent a novel attack, namely hardly perceptible Trojan attack (HPT). HPT\ncrafts hardly perceptible Trojan images by utilizing the additive noise and per\npixel flow field to tweak the pixel values and positions of the original\nimages, respectively. To achieve superior attack performance, we propose to\njointly optimize bit flips, additive noise, and flow field. Since the weight\nbits of the DNNs are binary, this problem is very hard to be solved. We handle\nthe binary constraint with equivalent replacement and provide an effective\noptimization algorithm. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, SVHN, and ImageNet\ndatasets show that the proposed HPT can generate hardly perceptible Trojan\nimages, while achieving comparable or better attack performance compared to the\nstate-of-the-art methods.

Due to the challenge of limited data,\nexisting works mainly focus on learning classifiers over pre-trained features,\nfailing to learn task-specific features for part segmentation.

We conduct prompt designing to reduce the gap between the pre-train\ntask (i.e., image generation) and the downstream task (i.e., part\nsegmentation), so that the GAN priors for generation can be leveraged for\nsegmentation. This is achieved by projecting part segmentation maps into the\nRGB space and conducting interpolation between RGB segmentation maps and\noriginal images. Specifically, we design a fine-tuning strategy to\nprogressively tune an image generator into a segmentation generator, where the\nsupervision of the generator varying from images to segmentation maps by\ninterpolation. Moreover, we propose a two-stream architecture, i.e., a\nsegmentation stream to generate task-specific features, and an image stream to\nprovide spatial constraints.

Almost all existing works follow the \"only look once\" framework that\nexploits a single model to directly capture the complex cross- and self-modal\nrelations among video-query pairs and retrieve the relevant segment. However,\nwe argue that these methods have overlooked two indispensable characteristics\nof an ideal localization method: 1) Frame-differentiable: considering the\nimbalance of positive/negative video frames, it is effective to highlight\npositive frames and weaken negative ones during the localization. 2)\nBoundary-precise: to predict the exact segment boundary, the model should\ncapture more fine-grained differences between consecutive frames since their\nvariations are often smooth. To this end, inspired by how humans perceive and\nlocalize a segment, we propose a two-step human-like framework called\nSkimming-Locating-Perusing (SLP). SLP consists of a Skimming-and-Locating (SL)\nmodule and a Bi-directional Perusing (BP) module. The SL module first refers to\nthe query semantic and selects the best matched frame from the video while\nfiltering out irrelevant frames. Then, the BP module constructs an initial\nsegment based on this frame, and dynamically updates it by exploring its\nadjacent frames until no frame shares the same activity semantic. Experimental\nresults on three challenging benchmarks show that our SLP is superior to the\nstate-of-the-art methods and localizes more precise segment boundaries.",

We\nconstruct two types of negative samples to enforce the model to accurately\nlearn the aligned multi-modal semantics and make complete semantic reasoning.\nWe apply the proposed model to both commonly and rarely appeared TSG cases, and\ndemonstrate its effectiveness by achieving the state-of-the-art performance on\nthree benchmark datasets (ActivityNet Caption, TACoS, and Charades-STA).",

    "title": "VICTOR: Visual Incompatibility Detection with Transformers and  Fashion-specific contrastive pre-training",
    "abstract": "In order to consider fashion outfits as aesthetically pleasing, the garments\nthat constitute them need to be compatible in terms of visual aspects, such as\nstyle, category and color. With the advent and omnipresence of computer vision\ndeep learning models, increased interest has also emerged for the task of\nvisual compatibility detection with the aim to develop quality fashion outfit\nrecommendation systems. Previous works have defined visual compatibility as a\nbinary classification task with items in a garment being considered as fully\ncompatible or fully incompatible. However, this is not applicable to Outfit\nMaker applications where users create their own outfits and need to know which\nspecific items may be incompatible with the rest of the outfit. To address\nthis, we propose the Visual InCompatibility TransfORmer (VICTOR) that is\noptimized for two tasks: 1) overall compatibility as regression and 2) the\ndetection of mismatching items. Unlike previous works that either rely on\nfeature extraction from ImageNet-pretrained models or by end-to-end fine\ntuning, we utilize fashion-specific contrastive language-image pre-training for\nfine tuning computer vision neural networks on fashion imagery. Moreover, we\nbuild upon the Polyvore outfit benchmark to generate partially mismatching\noutfits, creating a new dataset termed Polyvore-MISFITs, that is used to train\nVICTOR. A series of ablation and comparative analyses show that the proposed\narchitecture can compete and even surpass the current state-of-the-art on\nPolyvore datasets while reducing the instance-wise floating operations by 88%,\nstriking a balance between high performance and efficiency.",

    "abstract": "The best way to combine the results of deep learning with standard 3D\nreconstruction pipelines remains an open problem. While systems that pass the\noutput of traditional multi-view stereo approaches to a network for\nregularisation or refinement currently seem to get the best results, it may be\npreferable to treat deep neural networks as separate components whose results\ncan be probabilistically fused into geometry-based systems. Unfortunately, the\nerror models required to do this type of fusion are not well understood, with\nmany different approaches being put forward. Recently, a few systems have\nachieved good results by having their networks predict probability\ndistributions rather than single values. We propose using this approach to fuse\na learned single-view depth prior into a standard 3D reconstruction system.\nOur system is capable of incrementally producing dense depth maps for a set\nof keyframes. We train a deep neural network to predict discrete, nonparametric\nprobability distributions for the depth of each pixel from a single image. We\nthen fuse this \"probability volume\" with another probability volume based on\nthe photometric consistency between subsequent frames and the keyframe image.\nWe argue that combining the probability volumes from these two sources will\nresult in a volume that is better conditioned. To extract depth maps from the\nvolume, we minimise a cost function that includes a regularisation term based\non network predicted surface normals and occlusion boundaries. Through a series\nof experiments, we demonstrate that each of these components improves the\noverall performance of the system.",

In\nthis work, we take a step forwards to explore versatile virtual try-on\nsolutions, which we argue should possess three main properties, namely, they\nshould support unsupervised training, arbitrary garment categories, and\ncontrollable garment editing. To this end, we propose a\ncharacteristic-preserving end-to-end network, the PAtch-routed\nSpaTially-Adaptive GAN++ (PASTA-GAN++), to achieve a versatile system for\nhigh-resolution unpaired virtual try-on.

Furthermore, PASTA-GAN++\nintroduces a patch-based garment representation and a patch-guided parsing\nsynthesis block, allowing it to handle arbitrary garment categories and support\nlocal garment editing. Finally, to obtain try-on results with realistic texture\ndetails, PASTA-GAN++ incorporates a novel spatially-adaptive residual module to\ninject the coarse warped garment feature into the generator.

    "abstract": "Video transition effects are widely used in video editing to connect shots\nfor creating cohesive and visually appealing videos. However, it is challenging\nfor non-professionals to choose best transitions due to the lack of\ncinematographic knowledge and design skills. In this paper, we present the\npremier work on performing automatic video transitions recommendation (VTR):\ngiven a sequence of raw video shots and companion audio, recommend video\ntransitions for each pair of neighboring shots. To solve this task, we collect\na large-scale video transition dataset using publicly available video templates\non editing softwares. Then we formulate VTR as a multi-modal retrieval problem\nfrom vision/audio to video transitions and propose a novel multi-modal matching\nframework which consists of two parts. First we learn the embedding of video\ntransitions through a video transition classification task. Then we propose a\nmodel to learn the matching correspondence from vision/audio inputs to video\ntransitions. Specifically, the proposed model employs a multi-modal transformer\nto fuse vision and audio information, as well as capture the context cues in\nsequential transition outputs. Through both quantitative and qualitative\nexperiments, we clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

This paper shows that by using\nan off-the-shelf high-definition satellite image as a ready-to-use map, we are\nable to achieve cross-view vehicle localization up to a satisfactory accuracy,\nproviding a cheaper and more practical way for localization. Although the idea\nof using satellite images for cross-view localization is not new, previous\nmethods almost exclusively treat the task as image retrieval, namely matching a\nvehicle-captured ground-view image with the satellite image. This paper\npresents a novel cross-view localization method, which departs from the common\nwisdom of image retrieval. Specifically, our method develops (1) a\nGeometric-align Feature Extractor (GaFE) that leverages measured 3D points to\nbridge the geometric gap between ground view and overhead view, (2) a Pose\nAware Branch (PAB) adopting a triplet loss to encourage pose-aware feature\nextracting, and (3) a Recursive Pose Refine Branch (RPRB) using the\nLevenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm to align the initial pose towards the true\nvehicle pose iteratively. Our method is validated on KITTI and Ford Multi-AV\nSeasonal datasets as ground view and Google Maps as the satellite view.

Besides, CVT contains\nlearnable focuses for each class, which could accumulate the knowledge of\nprevious classes to alleviate forgetting. Based on the learnable focuses, we\ndesign a focal contrastive loss to rebalance contrastive learning between new\nand past classes and consolidate previously learned representations. Moreover,\nCVT contains a dual-classifier structure for decoupling learning current\nclasses and balancing all observed classes. The extensive experimental results\nshow that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with even fewer\nparameters on online CL benchmarks and effectively alleviates the catastrophic\nforgetting.",

    "abstract": "There has been growing interest in the use of multi-robot systems in various\ntasks and scenarios. The main attractiveness of such systems is their\nflexibility, robustness, and scalability. An often overlooked yet promising\nfeature is system modularity, which offers the possibility to harness agent\nspecialization, while also enabling system-level upgrades. However, altering\nthe agents' capacities can change the exploration-exploitation balance required\nto maximize the system's performance. Here, we study the effect of a swarm's\nheterogeneity on its exploration-exploitation balance while tracking multiple\nfast-moving evasive targets under the Cooperative Multi-Robot Observation of\nMultiple Moving Targets framework. To this end, we use a decentralized search\nand tracking strategy with adjustable levels of exploration and exploitation.\nBy indirectly tuning the balance, we first confirm the presence of an optimal\nbalance between these two key competing actions. Next, by substituting slower\nmoving agents with faster ones, we show that the system exhibits a performance\nimprovement without any modifications to the original strategy. In addition,\nowing to the additional amount of exploitation carried out by the faster\nagents, we demonstrate that a heterogeneous system's performance can be further\nimproved by reducing an agent's level of connectivity, to favor the conduct of\nexploratory actions. Furthermore, in studying the influence of the density of\nswarming agents, we show that the addition of faster agents can counterbalance\na reduction in the overall number of agents while maintaining the level of\ntracking performance. Finally, we explore the challenges of using\ndifferentiated strategies to take advantage of the heterogeneous nature of the\nswarm.",

    "abstract": "Masked image modeling (MIM) has achieved promising results on various vision\ntasks. However, the limited discriminability of learned representation\nmanifests there is still plenty to go for making a stronger vision learner.\nTowards this goal, we propose Contrastive Masked Autoencoders (CMAE), a new\nself-supervised pre-training method for learning more comprehensive and capable\nvision representations. By elaboratively unifying contrastive learning (CL) and\nmasked image model (MIM) through novel designs, CMAE leverages their respective\nadvantages and learns representations with both strong instance\ndiscriminability and local perceptibility. Specifically, CMAE consists of two\nbranches where the online branch is an asymmetric encoder-decoder and the\ntarget branch is a momentum updated encoder. During training, the online\nencoder reconstructs original images from latent representations of masked\nimages to learn holistic features. The target encoder, fed with the full\nimages, enhances the feature discriminability via contrastive learning with its\nonline counterpart. To make CL compatible with MIM, CMAE introduces two new\ncomponents, i.e. pixel shift for generating plausible positive views and\nfeature decoder for complementing features of contrastive pairs. Thanks to\nthese novel designs, CMAE effectively improves the representation quality and\ntransfer performance over its MIM counterpart. CMAE achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance on highly competitive benchmarks of image\nclassification, semantic segmentation and object detection. Notably, CMAE-Base\nachieves $85.3\\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet and $52.5\\%$ mIoU on ADE20k,\nsurpassing previous best results by $0.7\\%$ and $1.8\\%$ respectively.

Toward\nequipping machines with such capabilities, we propose the Primitive-based\nSketch Abstraction task where the goal is to represent sketches using a fixed\nset of drawing primitives under the influence of a budget. To solve this task,\nour Primitive-Matching Network (PMN), learns interpretable abstractions of a\nsketch in a self supervised manner.

We\nlearn this stroke-to-primitive mapping end-to-end with a distance-transform\nloss that is minimal when the original sketch is precisely reconstructed with\nthe predicted primitives. Our PMN abstraction empirically achieves the highest\nperformance on sketch recognition and sketch-based image retrieval given a\ncommunication budget, while at the same time being highly interpretable.

    "abstract": "The lack of labeled training data is the bottleneck of machine learning in\nmany applications. To resolve the bottleneck, one promising direction is the\ndata programming approach that aggregates different sources of weak supervision\nsignals to generate labeled data easily. Data programming encodes each weak\nsupervision source with a labeling function (LF), a user-provided program that\npredicts noisy labels. The quality of the generated labels depends on a label\naggregation model that aggregates all noisy labels from all LFs to infer the\nground-truth labels.\nExisting label aggregation methods typically rely on various assumptions and\nare not robust across datasets, as we will show empirically. We for the first\ntime provide an analytical label aggregation method that makes minimum\nassumption and is optimal in minimizing a certain form of the averaged\nprediction error. Since the complexity of the analytical form is exponential,\nwe train a model that learns to be the analytical method. Once trained, the\nmodel can be used for any unseen datasets and the model predicts the\nground-truth labels for each dataset in a single forward pass in linear time.\nWe show the model can be trained using synthetically generated data and design\nan effective architecture for the model.

The\ncircumstances of intelligent behavior in nature resulted from an organism\ninteracting with its surrounding environment, which could change over time and\nexert pressure on the organism to allow for learning of new behaviors or\nenvironment models. Our hypothesis is that learning occurs through interpreting\nsensory feedback when an agent acts in an environment. For that to happen, a\nbody and a reactive environment are needed. We evaluate a method to evolve a\nbiologically-inspired artificial neural network that learns from environment\nreactions named Neuroevolution of Artificial General Intelligence (NAGI), a\nframework for low-level AGI. This method allows the evolutionary\ncomplexification of a randomly-initialized spiking neural network with adaptive\nsynapses, which controls agents instantiated in mutable environments. Such a\nconfiguration allows us to benchmark the adaptivity and generality of the\ncontrollers. The chosen tasks in the mutable environments are food foraging,\nemulation of logic gates, and cart-pole balancing. The three tasks are\nsuccessfully solved with rather small network topologies and therefore it opens\nup the possibility of experimenting with more complex tasks and scenarios where\ncurriculum learning is beneficial.",

    "abstract": "The opaque reasoning of Graph Neural Networks induces a lack of human trust.\nExisting graph network explainers attempt to address this issue by providing\npost-hoc explanations, however, they fail to make the model itself more\ninterpretable. To fill this gap, we introduce the Concept Encoder Module, the\nfirst differentiable concept-discovery approach for graph networks. The\nproposed approach makes graph networks explainable by design by first\ndiscovering graph concepts and then using these to solve the task. Our results\ndemonstrate that this approach allows graph networks to: (i) attain model\naccuracy comparable with their equivalent vanilla versions, (ii) discover\nmeaningful concepts that achieve high concept completeness and purity scores,\n(iii) provide high-quality concept-based logic explanations for their\nprediction, and (iv) support effective interventions at test time: these can\nincrease human trust as well as significantly improve model performance.",

    "abstract": "Multi-scale learning frameworks have been regarded as a capable class of\nmodels to boost semantic segmentation. The problem nevertheless is not trivial\nespecially for the real-world deployments, which often demand high efficiency\nin inference latency. In this paper, we thoroughly analyze the design of\nconvolutional blocks (the type of convolutions and the number of channels in\nconvolutions), and the ways of interactions across multiple scales, all from\nlightweight standpoint for semantic segmentation. With such in-depth\ncomparisons, we conclude three principles, and accordingly devise Lightweight\nand Progressively-Scalable Networks (LPS-Net) that novelly expands the network\ncomplexity in a greedy manner. Technically, LPS-Net first capitalizes on the\nprinciples to build a tiny network. Then, LPS-Net progressively scales the tiny\nnetwork to larger ones by expanding a single dimension (the number of\nconvolutional blocks, the number of channels, or the input resolution) at one\ntime to meet the best speed/accuracy tradeoff. Extensive experiments conducted\non three datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of LPS-Net over\nseveral efficient semantic segmentation methods. More remarkably, our LPS-Net\nachieves 73.4% mIoU on Cityscapes test set, with the speed of 413.5FPS on an\nNVIDIA GTX 1080Ti, leading to a performance improvement by 1.5% and a 65%\nspeed-up against the state-of-the-art STDC.

    "abstract": "An efficient algorithm to solve the $k$ shortest non-homotopic path planning\n($k$-SNPP) problem in a 2D environment is proposed in this paper. Motivated by\naccelerating the inefficient exploration of the homotopy-augmented space of the\n2D environment, our fundamental idea is to identify the non-$k$-optimal path\ntopologies as early as possible and terminate the pathfinding along them. This\nis a non-trivial practice because it has to be done at an intermediate state of\nthe path planning process when locally shortest paths have not been fully\nconstructed. In other words, the paths to be compared have not rendezvoused at\nthe goal location, which makes the homotopy theory, modelling the spatial\nrelationship among the paths having the same endpoint, not applicable.\nThis paper is the first work that develops a systematic distance-based\ntopology simplification mechanism to solve the $k$-SNPP task, whose core\ncontribution is to assert the distance-based order of non-homotopic locally\nshortest paths before constructing them. If the order can be predicted, then\nthose path topologies having more than $k$ better topologies are proven free of\nthe desired $k$ paths and thus can be safely discarded during the path planning\nprocess. To this end, a hierarchical topological tree is proposed as an\nimplementation of the mechanism, whose nodes are proven to expand in\nnon-homotopic directions and edges (collision-free path segments) are proven\nlocally shortest. With efficient criteria that observe the order relations\nbetween partly constructed locally shortest paths being imparted into the tree,\nthe tree nodes that expand in non-$k$-optimal topologies will not be expanded.\nAs a result, the computational time for solving the $k$-SNPP problem is reduced\nby near two orders of magnitude.",

    "abstract": "Given a set of images of a scene, the re-rendering of this scene from novel\nviews and lighting conditions is an important and challenging problem in\nComputer Vision and Graphics. On the one hand, most existing works in Computer\nVision usually impose many assumptions regarding the image formation process,\ne.g. direct illumination and predefined materials, to make scene parameter\nestimation tractable. On the other hand, mature Computer Graphics tools allow\nmodeling of complex photo-realistic light transport given all the scene\nparameters. Combining these approaches, we propose a method for scene\nrelighting under novel views by learning a neural precomputed radiance transfer\nfunction, which implicitly handles global illumination effects using novel\nenvironment maps. Our method can be solely supervised on a set of real images\nof the scene under a single unknown lighting condition. To disambiguate the\ntask during training, we tightly integrate a differentiable path tracer in the\ntraining process and propose a combination of a synthesized OLAT and a real\nimage loss. Results show that the recovered disentanglement of scene parameters\nimproves significantly over the current state of the art and, thus, also our\nre-rendering results are more realistic and accurate.",

    "abstract": "Slip detection is of fundamental importance for the safety and efficiency of\nrovers driving on the surface of extraterrestrial bodies. Current planetary\nrover slip detection systems rely on visual perception on the assumption that\nsufficient visual features can be acquired in the environment. However,\nvisual-based methods are prone to suffer in perceptually degraded planetary\nenvironments with dominant low terrain features such as regolith, glacial\nterrain, salt-evaporites, and poor lighting conditions such as dark caves and\npermanently shadowed regions. Relying only on visual sensors for slip detection\nalso requires additional computational power and reduces the rover traversal\nrate. This paper answers the question of how to detect wheel slippage of a\nplanetary rover without depending on visual perception. In this respect, we\npropose a slip detection system that obtains its information from a\nproprioceptive localization framework that is capable of providing reliable,\ncontinuous, and computationally efficient state estimation over hundreds of\nmeters. This is accomplished by using zero velocity update, zero angular rate\nupdate, and non-holonomic constraints as pseudo-measurement updates on an\ninertial navigation system framework. The proposed method is evaluated on\nactual hardware and field-tested in a planetary-analog environment. The method\nachieves greater than 92% slip detection accuracy for distances around 150 m\nusing only an IMU and wheel encoders.",

The acyclic partitioning problem is defined as\npartitioning the vertex set of a given directed acyclic graph into disjoint and\ncollectively exhaustive subsets (parts).

That is, the quotient graph itself is also a\ngraph that contains no cycles.

On the other hand, predictions\naffected by long-term dependencies are sparse and characterized by high\nuncertainty given only local information. We propose MemUP, a new training\nmethod that allows to learn long-term dependencies without backpropagating\ngradients through the whole sequence at a time.

BMDP arise from Markov decision processes (MDP) by allowing for\nuncertainty on the transition probabilities in the form of intervals where the\nactual probabilities are unknown. $\\omega$-regular languages form a large class\nof properties, expressible as, e.g., Rabin or parity automata, encompassing\nrich specifications such as linear temporal logic. In a BMDP the probability to\nsatisfy the property depends on the unknown transitions probabilities as well\nas on the policy. In this paper, we compute the extreme values. This solves the\nproblem specifically suggested by Dutreix and Coogan in CDC 2018, extending\ntheir results on interval Markov chains with no adversary. The main idea is to\nreinterpret their work as analysis of interval MDP and accordingly the BMDP\nproblem as analysis of an $\\omega$-regular stochastic game, where a solution is\nprovided. This method extends smoothly further to bounded-parameter stochastic\ngames.",

    "abstract": "Understanding and comparing distributions of data (e.g., regarding their\nmodes, shapes, or outliers) is a common challenge in many scientific\ndisciplines. Typically, this challenge is addressed using side-by-side\ncomparisons of histograms or density plots. However, comparing multiple density\nplots is mentally demanding. Uniform histograms often represent distributions\nimprecisely since missing values, outliers, or modes are hidden by a grouping\nof equal size. In this paper, a novel type of overview visualization for the\ncomparison of univariate data distributions is presented: AccuStripes (i.e.,\naccumulated stripes) is a new visual metaphor encoding accumulations of data\ndistributions according to adaptive binning using color coded stripes of\nirregular width. We provide detailed insights about challenges of binning.\nSpecifically, we explore different adaptive binning concepts such as Bayesian\nBlocks binning and Jenks Natural Breaks binning for the computation of binning\nboundaries, in terms of their capabilities to represent the datasets as\naccurately as possible. In addition, we discuss issues arising with the\nrepresentation of designs for the comparative visualization of distributions:\nTo allow for a comparison of many distributions, their accumulated\nrepresentations are plotted below each other in a stacked mode. Based on our\nfindings, we propose three different layouts for comparative visualization of\nmultiple distributions. The usefulness of AccuStripes is investigated using a\nstatistical evaluation of the binning methods. Using a similarity metric from\ncluster analysis, it is shown, which binning method statistically yields the\nbest grouping results. Through a user study we evaluate, which binning strategy\nvisually represents the distribution in the most intuitive form and\ninvestigate, which layout allows the user the comparison of many distributions\nin the most effortless way.",

Hence, alert prioritization\nplays a crucial role in deciding which alerts to investigate from an enormous\nnumber of alerts that are generated by IDS. Recently, deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL) based deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) off-policy\nmethod has shown to achieve better results for alert prioritization as compared\nto other state-of-the-art methods. However, DDPG is prone to the problem of\noverfitting. Additionally, it also has a poor exploration capability and hence\nit is not suitable for problems with a stochastic environment. To address these\nlimitations, we present a soft actor-critic based DRL algorithm for alert\nprioritization (SAC-AP), an off-policy method, based on the maximum entropy\nreinforcement learning framework that aims to maximize the expected reward\nwhile also maximizing the entropy. Further, the interaction between an\nadversary and a defender is modeled as a zero-sum game and a double oracle\nframework is utilized to obtain the approximate mixed strategy Nash equilibrium\n(MSNE). SAC-AP finds robust alert investigation policies and computes pure\nstrategy best response against opponent's mixed strategy. We present the\noverall design of SAC-AP and evaluate its performance as compared to other\nstate-of-the art alert prioritization methods. We consider defender's loss,\ni.e., the defender's inability to investigate the alerts that are triggered due\nto attacks, as the performance metric. Our results show that SAC-AP achieves up\nto 30% decrease in defender's loss as compared to the DDPG based alert\nprioritization method and hence provides better protection against intrusions.\nMoreover, the benefits are even higher when SAC-AP is compared to other\ntraditional alert prioritization methods including Uniform, GAIN, RIO and\nSuricata.",

In this paper, we aim to explore a\nmore generalized kind of video frame interpolation, that at an arbitrary\ntime-step. To this end, we consider processing different time-steps with\nadaptively generated convolutional kernels in a unified way with the help of\nmeta-learning. Specifically, we develop a dual meta-learned frame interpolation\nframework to synthesize intermediate frames with the guidance of context\ninformation and optical flow as well as taking the time-step as side\ninformation. First, a content-aware meta-learned flow refinement module is\nbuilt to improve the accuracy of the optical flow estimation based on the\ndown-sampled version of the input frames. Second, with the refined optical flow\nand the time-step as the input, a motion-aware meta-learned frame interpolation\nmodule generates the convolutional kernels for every pixel used in the\nconvolution operations on the feature map of the coarse warped version of the\ninput frames to generate the predicted frame. Extensive qualitative and\nquantitative evaluations, as well as ablation studies, demonstrate that, via\nintroducing meta-learning in our framework in such a well-designed way, our\nmethod not only achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art frame\ninterpolation approaches but also owns an extended capacity to support the\ninterpolation at an arbitrary time-step.",

We present ShAPO, a method\nfor joint multi-object detection, 3D textured reconstruction, 6D object pose\nand size estimation. Key to ShAPO is a single-shot pipeline to regress shape,\nappearance and pose latent codes along with the masks of each object instance,\nwhich is then further refined in a sparse-to-dense fashion. A novel\ndisentangled shape and appearance database of priors is first learned to embed\nobjects in their respective shape and appearance space.

Our novel joint implicit\ntextured object representation allows us to accurately identify and reconstruct\nnovel unseen objects without having access to their 3D meshes.

The measurement of the flight time is carried out with TDC\nstructures. The measurement of this time difference at the ps level is directly\nrelated to the spatial resolution of the PET system. In this study, 45 nm CMOS\nVLSI simulations of TDC structures that have various architectural approaches\nwere performed for use in PET systems. With the designed TDC architectures, two\ngamma photons time reach to detectors have been simulated and the time\ndifference has been successfully digitized. In addition, various performance\nmetrics such as input and output voltages, time resolutions, measurement\nranges, and power analysis of TDC architectures have been determined. Proposed\nVernier oscillator-based TDC architecture has been reached 25 ps time\nresolution with a low power consumption of 1.62681 mW at 1V supply voltage.",

    "abstract": "The use of mid-circuit measurement and qubit reset within quantum programs\nhas been introduced recently and several applications demonstrated that perform\nconditional branching based on these measurements. In this work, we go a step\nfurther and describe a next-generation implementation of classical computation\nembedded within quantum programs that enables the real-time calculation and\nadjustment of program variables based on the mid-circuit state of measured\nqubits. A full-featured Quantum Intermediate Representation (QIR) model is used\nto describe the quantum circuit including its embedded classical computation.\nThis integrated approach eliminates the need to evaluate and store a\npotentially prohibitive volume of classical data within the quantum program in\norder to explore multiple solution paths. It enables a new type of quantum\nalgorithm that requires fewer round-trips between an external classical driver\nprogram and the execution of the quantum program, significantly reducing\ncomputational latency, as much of the classical computation can be performed\nduring the coherence time of quantum program execution. We review practical\nchallenges to implementing this approach along with developments underway to\naddress these challenges. An implementation of this novel and powerful quantum\nprogramming pattern, a random walk phase estimation algorithm, is demonstrated\non a physical quantum computer with an analysis of its benefits and feasibility\nas compared to existing quantum computing methods.",

State-of-the-art (SOTA) contrastive\nlearning techniques consider frames within a video as positives in the\nembedding space, whereas the frames from other videos are considered negatives.\nWe observe that unlike multiple views of an object in natural scene videos, an\nUltrasound (US) video captures different 2D slices of an organ. Hence, there is\nalmost no similarity between the temporally distant frames of even the same US\nvideo. In this paper we propose to instead utilize such frames as hard\nnegatives. We advocate mining both intra-video and cross-video negatives in a\nhardness-sensitive negative mining curriculum in a UCL framework to learn rich\nimage representations.

These are commonly determined following experimental tests in the\n20L sphere according to the international standards. Recently, CFD simulations\nhave emerged as a reliable alternative to predict the explosion behavior with\ngood accuracy and reduced labor and capital. In this work, numerical\nsimulations of biomass dust explosions are conducted with the open-source CFD\ncode OpenFOAM. The multi-phase (gas-solid) flow is treated in an\nEulerian-Lagrangian framework, using a two-way coupling regime and considering\nthe reactions of biomass conversion (moisture evaporation, devolatilization,\nand char oxidation), the combustion of volatile gases, and convective and\nradiative heat transfer. The model is validated with pressure-time and\nconcentration-dependent experimental measurements of two biomass samples.\nResults suggest that the characteristics of the cold-flow (\\i.e. turbulence\nlevels, actual dust concentration, spatial distribution of the dust cloud, and\nturbophoresis effect) govern the course of the explosion process, and depend\nstrongly on particle size, dust concentration, and ignition delay time effects.\nThese findings may be relevant in the design of better dust explosion testing\ndevices and to the reexamination of the guidelines for the operation of the\nexperiment. Finally, a thorough discussion on the explosion pressures, degree\nof biomass conversion, flame temperature, flame propagation patterns, and the\ndust agglomeration effect is presented.",

This work\naddresses the gap in the prior work by providing new theoretical and numerical\ninsights into DMBAs under mismatched CNN priors. Mismatched priors arise\nnaturally when there is a distribution shift between training and testing data,\nfor example, due to test images being from a different distribution than images\nused for training the CNN prior.

These methods would help identify or, in the case of generative\nmodels, even create novel crystal structures of materials with a set of\nspecified functional properties to then be synthesized or isolated in the\nlaboratory. For crystal structure generation, a key bottleneck lies in\ndeveloping suitable atomic structure fingerprints or representations for the\nmachine learning model, analogous to the graph-based or SMILES representations\nused in molecular generation. However, finding data-efficient representations\nthat are invariant to translations, rotations, and permutations, while\nremaining invertible to the Cartesian atomic coordinates remains an ongoing\nchallenge. Here, we propose an alternative approach to this problem by taking\nexisting non-invertible representations with the desired invariances and\ndeveloping an algorithm to reconstruct the atomic coordinates through\ngradient-based optimization using automatic differentiation. This can then be\ncoupled to a generative machine learning model which generates new materials\nwithin the representation space, rather than in the data-inefficient Cartesian\nspace. In this work, we implement this end-to-end structure generation approach\nusing atom-centered symmetry functions as the representation and conditional\nvariational autoencoders as the generative model.

    "abstract": "Regulatory stress tests have become the primary tool for setting capital\nrequirements at the largest U.S. banks. The Federal Reserve uses confidential\nmodels to evaluate bank-specific outcomes for bank-specific portfolios in\nshared stress scenarios. As a matter of policy, the same models are used for\nall banks, despite considerable heterogeneity across institutions; individual\nbanks have contended that some models are not suited to their businesses.\nMotivated by this debate, we ask, what is a fair aggregation of individually\ntailored models into a common model? We argue that simply pooling data across\nbanks treats banks equally but is subject to two deficiencies: it may distort\nthe impact of legitimate portfolio features, and it is vulnerable to implicit\nmisdirection of legitimate information to infer bank identity.

    "abstract": "We present automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems for Tamil and Kannada\nbased on subword modeling to effectively handle unlimited vocabulary due to the\nhighly agglutinative nature of the languages. We explore byte pair encoding\n(BPE), and proposed a variant of this algorithm named extended-BPE, and\nMorfessor tool to segment each word as subwords. We have effectively\nincorporated maximum likelihood (ML) and Viterbi estimation techniques with\nweighted finite state transducers (WFST) framework in these algorithms to learn\nthe subword dictionary from a large text corpus. Using the learnt subword\ndictionary, the words in training data transcriptions are segmented to subwords\nand we train deep neural network ASR systems which recognize subword sequence\nfor any given test speech utterance. The output subword sequence is then\npost-processed using deterministic rules to get the final word sequence such\nthat the actual number of words that can be recognized is much larger. For\nTamil ASR, We use 152 hours of data for training and 65 hours for testing,\nwhereas for Kannada ASR, we use 275 hours for training and 72 hours for\ntesting. Upon experimenting with different combination of segmentation and\nestimation techniques, we find that the word error rate (WER) reduces\ndrastically when compared to the baseline word-level ASR, achieving a maximum\nabsolute WER reduction of 6.24% and 6.63% for Tamil and Kannada respectively.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present specially designed automatic speech recognition\n(ASR) systems for the highly agglutinative and inflective languages of Tamil\nand Kannada that can recognize unlimited vocabulary of words. We use subwords\nas the basic lexical units for recognition and construct subword grammar\nweighted finite state transducer (SG-WFST) graphs for word segmentation that\ncaptures most of the complex word formation rules of the languages. We have\nidentified the following category of words (i) verbs, (ii) nouns, (ii)\npronouns, and (iv) numbers. The prefix, infix and suffix lists of subwords are\ncreated for each of these categories and are used to design the SG-WFST graphs.\nWe also present a heuristic segmentation algorithm that can even segment\nexceptional words that do not follow the rules encapsulated in the SG-WFST\ngraph. Most of the data-driven subword dictionary creation algorithms are\ncomputation driven, and hence do not guarantee morpheme-like units and so we\nhave used the linguistic knowledge of the languages and manually created the\nsubword dictionaries and the graphs. Finally, we train a deep neural network\nacoustic model and combine it with the pronunciation lexicon of the subword\ndictionary and the SG-WFST graph to build the subword-ASR systems. Since the\nsubword-ASR produces subword sequences as output for a given test speech, we\npost-process its output to get the final word sequence, so that the actual\nnumber of words that can be recognized is much higher. Upon experimenting the\nsubword-ASR system with the IISc-MILE Tamil and Kannada ASR corpora, we observe\nan absolute word error rate reduction of 12.39% and 13.56% over the baseline\nword-based ASR systems for Tamil and Kannada, respectively.",

In this work, we\npresent a consecutive algorithm for super-resolution (STED) scanning microscopy\nthat provides molecule counts in automatically generated image segments and\noffers statistical guarantees in form of asymptotic confidence intervals. To\nthis end, we first apply a multiscale scanning procedure on STED microscopy\nmeasurements of the sample to obtain a system of significant regions, each of\nwhich contains at least one molecule with prescribed uniform probability.

    "abstract": "Clinical diagnosis of the pediatric musculoskeletal system relies on the\nanalysis of medical imaging examinations. In the medical image processing\npipeline, semantic segmentation using deep learning algorithms enables an\nautomatic generation of patient-specific three-dimensional anatomical models\nwhich are crucial for morphological evaluation. However, the scarcity of\npediatric imaging resources may result in reduced accuracy and generalization\nperformance of individual deep segmentation models. In this study, we propose\nto design a novel multi-task, multi-domain learning framework in which a single\nsegmentation network is optimized over the union of multiple datasets arising\nfrom distinct parts of the anatomy. Unlike previous approaches, we\nsimultaneously consider multiple intensity domains and segmentation tasks to\novercome the inherent scarcity of pediatric data while leveraging shared\nfeatures between imaging datasets. To further improve generalization\ncapabilities, we employ a transfer learning scheme from natural image\nclassification, along with a multi-scale contrastive regularization aimed at\npromoting domain-specific clusters in the shared representations, and\nmulti-joint anatomical priors to enforce anatomically consistent predictions.\nWe evaluate our contributions for performing bone segmentation using three\nscarce and pediatric imaging datasets of the ankle, knee, and shoulder joints.\nOur results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms individual,\ntransfer, and shared segmentation schemes in Dice metric with statistically\nsufficient margins.

    "abstract": "Combinatorial optimization (CO) layers in machine learning (ML) pipelines are\na powerful tool to tackle data-driven decision tasks, but they come with two\nmain challenges. First, the solution of a CO problem often behaves as a\npiecewise constant function of its objective parameters. Given that ML\npipelines are typically trained using stochastic gradient descent, the absence\nof slope information is very detrimental. Second, standard ML losses do not\nwork well in combinatorial settings. A growing body of research addresses these\nchallenges through diverse methods. Unfortunately, the lack of well-maintained\nimplementations slows down the adoption of CO layers.\nIn this paper, building upon previous works, we introduce a probabilistic\nperspective on CO layers, which lends itself naturally to approximate\ndifferentiation and the construction of structured losses. We recover many\napproaches from the literature as special cases, and we also derive new ones.\nBased on this unifying perspective, we present InferOpt.jl, an open-source\nJulia package that 1) allows turning any CO oracle with a linear objective into\na differentiable layer, and 2) defines adequate losses to train pipelines\ncontaining such layers. Our library works with arbitrary optimization\nalgorithms, and it is fully compatible with Julia's ML ecosystem. We\ndemonstrate its abilities using a pathfinding problem on video game maps.",

Therefore, for further imaging surveillance and treatment planning, it\nis important to be able to predict if an UIA is likely to grow based on an\ninitial baseline Time-of-Flight MRA (TOF-MRA). It is known that the size and\nshape of UIAs are predictors of aneurysm growth and/or rupture.

We include 151 TOF-MRAs, with 169\nUIAs where 49 UIAs were classified as growing and 120 as stable, based on the\nclinical definition of growth (>1 mm increase in size in follow-up scan). UIAs\nwere segmented from TOF-MRAs and meshes were automatically generated.

We develop a classification model\nto predict UIAs that will grow or remain stable. The model consisted of a mesh\nconvolutional neural network including additional novel input edge features of\nshape index and curvedness which describe the surface topology.

For example, in planning problems, providing an optimal\nsolution is the same as giving a feasible solution (the \"positive\" information)\ntogether with a proof of the fact that there cannot be feasible solutions\nbetter than the one given (the \"negative\" information). We model negative\ninformation by introducing the concept of \"norphisms\", as opposed to the\npositive information of morphisms. A \"nategory\" is a category that has\n\"Nom\"-sets in addition to hom-sets, and specifies the compatibility rules\nbetween norphisms and morphisms. With this setup we can choose to work in\n\"coherent\" \"subnategories\": subcategories that describe a potential\ninstantiation of the world in which all morphisms and norphisms are compatible.\nWe derive the composition rules for norphisms in a coherent subnategory; we\nshow that norphisms do not compose by themselves, but rather they need to use\nmorphisms as catalysts. We have two distinct rules of the type $\\text{morphism}\n+ \\text{norphism} \\rightarrow \\text{norphism}$. We then show that those complex\nrules for norphism inference are actually as natural as the ones for morphisms,\nfrom the perspective of enriched category theory. Every small category is\nenriched over $\\text{P}= \\langle \\text{Set}, \\times, 1\\rangle$. We show that we\ncan derive the machinery of norphisms by considering an enrichment over a\ncertain monoidal category called PN(for \"positive\"/\"negative\"). In summary, we\nshow that an alternative to considering negative information using logic on top\nof the categorical formalization is to \"categorify\" the negative information,\nobtaining negative arrows that live at the same level as the positive arrows,\nand suggest that the new inference rules are born of the same substance from\nthe perspective of enriched category theory.",

The promise of leveraging such technologies to accelerate\nthe solution of difficult optimization problems has spurred an increased\ninterest in exploring methods to integrate Ising problems as part of their\nsolution process, with existing approaches ranging from direct transcription to\nhybrid quantum-classical approaches rooted in existing optimization algorithms.\nDue to the heuristic and black-box nature of the underlying Ising solvers, many\nsuch approaches have limited optimality guarantees. While some hybrid\nalgorithms may converge to global optima, their underlying classical algorithms\ntypically rely on exhaustive search, making it unclear if such algorithmic\nscaffolds are primed to take advantage of speed-ups that the Ising solver may\noffer. In this paper, we propose a framework for solving mixed-binary quadratic\nprograms (MBQP) to global optimality using black-box and heuristic Ising\nsolvers. We show the exactness of a convex copositive reformulation of MBQPs,\nwhich we propose to solve via a hybrid quantum-classical cutting-plane\nalgorithm. The classical portion of this hybrid framework is guaranteed to be\npolynomial time, suggesting that when applied to NP-hard problems, the\ncomplexity of the solution is shifted onto the subroutine handled by the Ising\nsolver.",

    "title": "Do Quantum Circuit Born Machines Generalize?",
    "abstract": "In recent proposals of quantum circuit models for generative tasks, the\ndiscussion about their performance has been limited to their ability to\nreproduce a known target distribution. For example, expressive model families\nsuch as Quantum Circuit Born Machines (QCBMs) have been almost entirely\nevaluated on their capability to learn a given target distribution with high\naccuracy. While this aspect may be ideal for some tasks, it limits the scope of\na generative model's assessment to its ability to memorize data rather than\ngeneralize. As a result, there has been little understanding of a model's\ngeneralization performance and the relation between such capability and the\nresource requirements, e.g., the circuit depth and the amount of training data.\nIn this work, we leverage upon a recently proposed generalization evaluation\nframework to begin addressing this knowledge gap. We first investigate the\nQCBM's learning process of a cardinality-constrained distribution and see an\nincrease in generalization performance while increasing the circuit depth. In\nthe 12-qubit example presented here, we observe that with as few as 30% of the\nvalid patterns as the training set, the QCBM exhibits the best generalization\nperformance toward generating unseen and valid patterns. Lastly, we assess the\nQCBM's ability to generalize not only to valid features, but to high-quality\nbitstrings distributed according to an adequately biased distribution. We see\nthat the QCBM is able to effectively learn the bias and generate unseen samples\nwith higher quality than those in the training set. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first work in the literature that presents the QCBM's\ngeneralization performance as an integral evaluation metric for quantum\ngenerative models, and demonstrates the QCBM's ability to generalize to\nhigh-quality, desired novel samples.",
