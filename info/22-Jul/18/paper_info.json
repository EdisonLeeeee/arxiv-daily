    "abstract": "Existing Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems need to read messages from the email\nwhich may have Personal Identifiable Information (PII) to text messages that\ncan have a streak of emojis and punctuation. 92% of the world's online\npopulation use emoji with more than 10 billion emojis sent everyday. Lack of\npreprocessor leads to messages being read as-is including punctuation and\ninfographics like emoticons. This problem worsens if there is a continuous\nsequence of punctuation/emojis that are quite common in real-world\ncommunications like messaging, Social Networking Site (SNS) interactions, etc.\nIn this work, we aim to introduce a lightweight intelligent preprocessor (LIP)\nthat can enhance the readability of a message before being passed downstream to\nexisting TTS systems. We propose multiple sub-modules including: expanding\ncontraction, censoring swear words, and masking of PII, as part of our\npreprocessor to enhance the readability of text. With a memory footprint of\nonly 3.55 MB and inference time of 4 ms for up to 50-character text, our\nsolution is suitable for real-time deployment. This work being the first of its\nkind, we try to benchmark with an open independent survey, the result of which\nshows 76.5% preference towards LIP enabled TTS engine as compared to standard\nTTS.",

    "abstract": "Virtual reality(VR) is a hot research topic, and it has been effectively\napplied in military, education and other fields. The application prospect of\nvirtual reality in education is very broad. It can effectively reduce labor\ncost, resource consumption, stimulate students' interest in learning, and\nimprove students' knowledge level. New energy vehicles have also been widely\npromoted in recent years, and the production of new energy vehicles has played\na key role in it. However, the teaching of car engine disassembly and assembly\nstill retains a more traditional way. That's why applying VR technology has\nhigh significance. This project uses the Unity 3D engine to develop a VR-based\nengine teaching software, which aims to allow users to use VR headsets, handles\nand other accessories to simulate the disassembly and assembly of car engines\nin a virtual environment. We design a modular system framework and divided the\nsoftware into two layers, the system layer and the function layer. The system\nlayer includes a message system and a data configuration system. The functional\nlayer includes the user interface system, disassembly and assembly function,\nand data module. In addition to fulfilling functional requirements , we used\nthe Unity UPR tool to check out performance issues, and optimized product\nperformance by turning off vertical sync and turning on static switches for\nsome scene objects.",

The algorithm we suggest solves the\nproblem in two phases. It starts by constructing the connectivity structure of\nthe system using machine learning methods -- producing thus a graph of\ninterconnected subsystems. Then this graph is enhanced by recovering the\nHamiltonian structure of each subsystem as well as the corresponding ports.\nThis second phase relies heavily on results from symplectic and Poisson\ngeometry that we briefly sketch. And the precise solutions can be constructed\nusing methods of computer algebra and symbolic computations.

This process is performed\nmanually by a triager, who analyzes developers profiles and submitted bug\nreports to make suitable assignments. Bug triaging process is time consuming\nthus automating this process is essential to improve the quality of software.\nPrevious work addressed triaging problem either as an information retrieval or\nclassification problem. This paper tackles this problem as a resource\nallocation problem, that aims at the best assignments of developers to bug\nreports, that reduces the total fixing time of the newly submitted bug reports,\nin addition to the even distribution of bug reports over developers. In this\npaper, a combination of matrix factorization and Gale Shapely algorithm,\nsupported by the differential evolution is firstly introduced to optimize the\ntotal fix time and normalize developers work load. Matrix factorization is used\nto establish a recommendation system for Gale-Shapley to make assignment\ndecisions. Differential evolution provides the best set of weights to build\ndevelopers score profiles. The proposed approach is assessed over three\nrepositories, Linux, Apache and Eclipse. Experimental results show that the\nproposed approach reduces the bug fixing time, in comparison to the manual\ntriage, by 80.67%, 23.61% and 60.22% over Linux, Eclipse and Apache\nrespectively.

    "abstract": "It is common to address the curse of dimensionality in Markov decision\nprocesses (MDPs) by exploiting low-rank representations. This motivates much of\nthe recent theoretical study on linear MDPs. However, most approaches require a\ngiven representation under unrealistic assumptions about the normalization of\nthe decomposition or introduce unresolved computational challenges in practice.\nInstead, we consider an alternative definition of linear MDPs that\nautomatically ensures normalization while allowing efficient representation\nlearning via contrastive estimation. The framework also admits\nconfidence-adjusted index algorithms, enabling an efficient and principled\napproach to incorporating optimism or pessimism in the face of uncertainty. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this provides the first practical representation\nlearning method for linear MDPs that achieves both strong theoretical\nguarantees and empirical performance. Theoretically, we prove that the proposed\nalgorithm is sample efficient in both the online and offline settings.\nEmpirically, we demonstrate superior performance over existing state-of-the-art\nmodel-based and model-free algorithms on several benchmarks.",

We also give\nnew algorithms for $\\textsf{Max-DICUT}$ in variants of the adversarial ordering\nsetting. Specifically, we give a two-pass $O(\\log n)$ space\n$0.48$-approximation algorithm for general graphs and a single-pass\n$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{n})$ space $0.48$-approximation algorithm for bounded degree\ngraphs.\nOn the negative side, we prove that CSPs where the satisfying assignments of\nthe constraints support a one-wise independent distribution require\n$\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$-space for any non-trivial approximation, even when the\nconstraints are randomly ordered.

In that regard, the importance of\ncaptivating and inviting cover art cannot be underestimated, because it is\ndeeply entangled with a song's character and the artist's identity, and remains\none of the most important gateways to lead people to discover music. However,\ndesigning cover art is a highly creative, lengthy and sometimes expensive\nprocess that can be daunting, especially for non-professional artists. For this\nreason, we propose a novel deep-learning framework to generate cover art guided\nby audio features.

This paper outlines the architectural details of our models and\ndiscusses the optimization challenges that emerge from them. More specifically,\nwe will exploit genetic algorithms to overcome bad local minima and adversarial\nexamples. We find that our framework can generate suitable cover art for most\ngenres, and that the visual features adapt themselves to audio feature changes.\nGiven these results, we believe that our framework paves the road for\nextensions and more advanced applications in audio-guided visual generation\ntasks.",

We use a combination of deep learning and social network\nanalysis to model emotion contagion as a diffusion process in dynamic social\nnetwork graphs, taking into consideration key aspects like causality,\nhomophily, and interference. We evaluate our approach on user behavior data\nobtained from a popular social media platform for sharing short videos.

As per the theory of diffusion, we account for\nthe videos a user watches during this time (inflow) and the daily engagements;\nliking, sharing, downloading or creating new videos (outflow) to estimate\ncontagion. To validate our approach and analysis, we obtain human feedback on\nthese 48 social media platform users with an online study by collecting\nresponses of about 150 participants.

    "abstract": "Deep clustering has recently attracted significant attention. Despite the\nremarkable progress, most of the previous deep clustering works still suffer\nfrom two limitations. First, many of them focus on some distribution-based\nclustering loss, lacking the ability to exploit sample-wise (or\naugmentation-wise) relationships via contrastive learning. Second, they often\nneglect the indirect sample-wise structure information, overlooking the rich\npossibilities of multi-scale neighborhood structure learning. In view of this,\nthis paper presents a new deep clustering approach termed Image clustering with\ncontrastive learning and multi-scale Graph Convolutional Networks (IcicleGCN),\nwhich bridges the gap between convolutional neural network (CNN) and graph\nconvolutional network (GCN) as well as the gap between contrastive learning and\nmulti-scale neighborhood structure learning for the image clustering task. The\nproposed IcicleGCN framework consists of four main modules, namely, the\nCNN-based backbone, the Instance Similarity Module (ISM), the Joint Cluster\nStructure Learning and Instance reconstruction Module (JC-SLIM), and the\nMulti-scale GCN module (M-GCN). Specifically, with two random augmentations\nperformed on each image, the backbone network with two weight-sharing views is\nutilized to learn the representations for the augmented samples, which are then\nfed to ISM and JC-SLIM for instance-level and cluster-level contrastive\nlearning, respectively. Further, to enforce multi-scale neighborhood structure\nlearning, two streams of GCNs and an auto-encoder are simultaneously trained\nvia (i) the layer-wise interaction with representation fusion and (ii) the\njoint self-adaptive learning that ensures their last-layer output distributions\nto be consistent. Experiments on multiple image datasets demonstrate the\nsuperior clustering performance of IcicleGCN over the state-of-the-art.",

In this work, we provide a simple\nalgorithm that relies on perturbation experiments on latent codes of a\npre-trained generative autoencoder to uncover a causal graph that is implied by\nthe generative model. We leverage pre-trained attribute classifiers and perform\nperturbation experiments to check for influence of a given latent variable on a\nsubset of attributes. Given this, we show that one can fit an effective causal\ngraph that models a structural equation model between latent codes taken as\nexogenous variables and attributes taken as observed variables. One interesting\naspect is that a single latent variable controls multiple overlapping subsets\nof attributes unlike conventional approach that tries to impose full\nindependence. Using a pre-trained RNN-based generative autoencoder trained on a\ndataset of peptide sequences, we demonstrate that the learnt causal graph from\nour algorithm between various attributes and latent codes can be used to\npredict a specific property for sequences which are unseen. We compare\nprediction models trained on either all available attributes or only the ones\nin the Markov blanket and empirically show that in both the unsupervised and\nsupervised regimes, typically, using the predictor that relies on Markov\nblanket attributes generalizes better for out-of-distribution sequences.",

    "title": "Contrastive Adapters for Foundation Model Group Robustness",
    "abstract": "While large pretrained foundation models (FMs) have shown remarkable\nzero-shot classification robustness to dataset-level distribution shifts, their\nrobustness to subpopulation or group shifts is relatively underexplored. We\nstudy this problem, and find that FMs such as CLIP may not be robust to various\ngroup shifts. Across 9 robustness benchmarks, zero-shot classification with\ntheir embeddings results in gaps of up to 80.7 percentage points (pp) between\naverage and worst-group accuracy. Unfortunately, existing methods to improve\nrobustness require retraining, which can be prohibitively expensive on large\nfoundation models. We also find that efficient ways to improve model inference\n(e.g., via adapters, lightweight networks with FM embeddings as inputs) do not\nconsistently improve and can sometimes hurt group robustness compared to\nzero-shot (e.g., increasing the accuracy gap by 50.1 pp on CelebA). We thus\ndevelop an adapter training strategy to effectively and efficiently improve FM\ngroup robustness. Our motivating observation is that while poor robustness\nresults from groups in the same class being embedded far apart in the\nfoundation model \"embedding space,\" standard adapter training may not bring\nthese points closer together. We thus propose contrastive adapting, which\ntrains adapters with contrastive learning to bring sample embeddings close to\nboth their ground-truth class embeddings and other sample embeddings in the\nsame class. Across the 9 benchmarks, our approach consistently improves group\nrobustness, raising worst-group accuracy by 8.5 to 56.0 pp over zero-shot. Our\napproach is also efficient, doing so without any FM finetuning and only a fixed\nset of frozen FM embeddings. On benchmarks such as Waterbirds and CelebA, this\nleads to worst-group accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods that\nretrain entire models, while only training $\\leq$1% of the model parameters.",

    "abstract": "Passivity property gives a sense of energy balance. The classical definitions\nand theorems of passivity in dynamical systems require time invariance and\nlocally Lipschitz functions. However, these conditions are not met in many\nsystems. A characteristic example is nonautonomous underactuated, discontinuous\nsystems due to friction. This paper presents an extended result for the\nnegative feedback connection of two passive nonautonomous systems with a\nset-valued right-hand side based on an invariance-like principle. Such\nextension is the base of a structural passivity-based control synthesis for\nunderactuated mechanical systems with Coulomb friction. The first step consists\nin designing the control able to restore the passivity in the considered\nfriction law, achieving stabilization of the system trajectories to a domain\nwith zero velocities. Then, an integral action is included to improve the\nlatter result and perform a tracking over a reference. At last, the control is\ndesigned considering (slow) dynamics in the actuation. These control objectives\nare obtained using fewer control inputs than degrees of freedom, as a result of\nthe underactuated nature of the plant. The presented control strategy is\nimplemented in an earthquake prevention scenario, where a mature seismogenic\nfault represents the considered frictional underactuated mechanical system.\nSimulations are performed to show how the seismic energy can be slowly\ndissipated by tracking a slow reference, thanks to fluid injection far from the\nfault, accounting also for the slow dynamics of the fluid's diffusion.",

    "abstract": "Platooning and coordination are two implementation strategies that are\nfrequently proposed for traffic control of connected and autonomous vehicles\n(CAVs) at signal-free intersections instead of using conventional traffic\nsignals. However, few studies have attempted to integrate both strategies to\nbetter facilitate the CAV control at signal-free intersections. To this end,\nthis study proposes a hierarchical control model, named COOR-PLT, to coordinate\nadaptive CAV platoons at a signal-free intersection based on deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL). COOR-PLT has a two-layer framework. The first layer uses a\ncentralized control strategy to form adaptive platoons. The optimal size of\neach platoon is determined by considering multiple objectives (i.e.,\nefficiency, fairness and energy saving). The second layer employs a\ndecentralized control strategy to coordinate multiple platoons passing through\nthe intersection. Each platoon is labeled with coordinated status or\nindependent status, upon which its passing priority is determined. As an\nefficient DRL algorithm, Deep Q-network (DQN) is adopted to determine platoon\nsizes and passing priorities respectively in the two layers. The model is\nvalidated and examined on the simulator Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO).\nThe simulation results demonstrate that the model is able to: (1) achieve\nsatisfactory convergence performances; (2) adaptively determine platoon size in\nresponse to varying traffic conditions; and (3) completely avoid deadlocks at\nthe intersection. By comparison with other control methods, the model manifests\nits superiority of adopting adaptive platooning and DRL-based coordination\nstrategies. Also, the model outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on\nreducing travel time and fuel consumption in different traffic conditions.",

    "abstract": "Jackknifing refers to the serious situation where a vehicle-trailer system\nenters a jackknife state and the vehicle and trailer eventually collide if\ntrailer operation is not corrected. This paper considers low speed trailer\nmaneuvering typical of trailer backing where jackknife state limits can vary\ndue to sideslip caused by physical interaction between the vehicle, trailer,\nand environment. Analysis of a kinematic model considering sideslip at the\nvehicle and trailer wheels indicates that vehicle-trailer systems should be\ndivided into three categories based on the ratio of hitch length and trailer\ntongue length, each with distinct behaviors. The Long Trailer category may have\nno jackknifing state while the other two categories always have states leading\nto jackknifing. It is found that jackknife limits, which are the boundaries\nbetween the jackknifing state and the recoverable regions, can be divided into\nsafe and unsafe limits, the latter of which must be avoided. Simulations and\nphysical experiments support these results and provide insight about the\nimplications of vehicle and trailer states with slip that lead to jackknifing.\nSimulations also demonstrate the benefit of considering these new slip-based\njackknife limits in trailer backing control.",

Second, we\ngive a new PSPACE-hardness proof for the reversible `billiard ball' model of\nFredkin and Toffoli from 40 years ago, newly establishing hardness when only\ntwo balls move at once. Third, we prove PSPACE-completeness of zero-player\nmotion planning with any reversible deterministic interacting $k$-tunnel gadget\nand a `rotate clockwise' gadget (a zero-player analog of branching hallways).\nFourth, we give simpler proofs that zero-player motion planning is\nPSPACE-complete with just a single gadget, the 3-spinner. These results should\nin turn make it even easier to prove PSPACE-hardness of other reversible\ndeterministic systems.",

We solve an initial value problem (IVP) for the partial\ndifferential equation (PDE) by casting it as a saddle point of a min-max\nproblem and using iterative optimization methods to find the saddle point. Our\napproach is flexible with the choice of both time and spatial discretization\nschemes. It benefits from the implicit structure and gains large regions of\nstability, and overcomes the restriction on the mesh size in time by explicit\nschemes from Courant--Friedrichs--Lewy (CFL) conditions (really via von Neumann\nstability analysis). Nevertheless, it is highly parallelizable and\neasy-to-implement. In particular, no nonlinear inversions are required!\nSpecifically, we illustrate our approach using the finite difference scheme and\ndiscontinuous Galerkin method for the spatial scheme; backward Euler and\nbackward differentiation formulas for implicit discretization in time.\nNumerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the\napproach.

    "abstract": "Typical text spotters follow the two-stage spotting strategy: detect the\nprecise boundary for a text instance first and then perform text recognition\nwithin the located text region. While such strategy has achieved substantial\nprogress, there are two underlying limitations. 1) The performance of text\nrecognition depends heavily on the precision of text detection, resulting in\nthe potential error propagation from detection to recognition. 2) The RoI\ncropping which bridges the detection and recognition brings noise from\nbackground and leads to information loss when pooling or interpolating from\nfeature maps. In this work we propose the single shot Self-Reliant Scene Text\nSpotter (SRSTS), which circumvents these limitations by decoupling recognition\nfrom detection. Specifically, we conduct text detection and recognition in\nparallel and bridge them by the shared positive anchor point. Consequently, our\nmethod is able to recognize the text instances correctly even though the\nprecise text boundaries are challenging to detect. Additionally, our method\nreduces the annotation cost for text detection substantially. Extensive\nexperiments on regular-shaped benchmark and arbitrary-shaped benchmark\ndemonstrate that our SRSTS compares favorably to previous state-of-the-art\nspotters in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.",

Second, existing methods overlook the high uncertainty in the\nmemory data distribution since there is a big gap between the memory data\ndistribution and the distribution of all the previous data examples. To address\nthese problems, for the first time, we propose a principled memory evolution\nframework to dynamically evolve the memory data distribution by making the\nmemory buffer gradually harder to be memorized with distributionally robust\noptimization (DRO). We then derive a family of methods to evolve the memory\nbuffer data in the continuous probability measure space with Wasserstein\ngradient flow (WGF). The proposed DRO is w.r.t the worst-case evolved memory\ndata distribution, thus guarantees the model performance and learns\nsignificantly more robust features than existing memory-replay-based methods.\nExtensive experiments on existing benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed methods for alleviating forgetting.

    "abstract": "Limited by the memory capacity and computation power, singe-node graph\nconvolutional neural network (GCN) accelerators cannot complete the execution\nof GCNs within a reasonable time, due to explosive graphs nowadays. Thus,\nlarge-scale GCNs call for a multi-node acceleration system (MultiAccSys) like\nTPU-Pod for large-scale neural network. In this work, we aim to scale the\nsingle-node GCN accelerator to accelerate GCNs on large-scale graphs. We first\nidentify the communication pattern and challenges of the multi-node\nacceleration for GCNs on large-scale graphs. We observe that (1) the existence\nof the irregular coarse-grained communication pattern exists in the execution\nof GCNs in MultiAccSys, which introduces massive redundant network\ntransmissions and off-chip memory accesses; (2) the acceleration of GCNs in\nMultiAccSys is mainly bounded by network bandwidth but tolerates network\nlatency. Guided by the above observations, we then propose MultiGCN, an\nefficient MultiAccSys for large-scale GCNs that trades network latency for\nnetwork bandwidth. Specifically, by leveraging the network latency tolerance,\nwe first propose a topology-aware multicast mechanism with a one put per\nmulticast message-passing model to reduce transmissions and alleviate network\nbandwidth requirements. Second, we introduce a scatter-based round execution\nmechanism which cooperates with the multicast mechanism and reduces redundant\noff-chip memory accesses. Compared to the baseline MultiAccSys, MultiGCN\nachieves 4-12x speedup using only 28%-68% energy, while reducing 32%\ntransmissions and 73% off-chip memory accesses on average. Besides, MultiGCN\nnot only achieves 2.5-8x speedup over the state-of-the-art multi-GPU solution,\nbut also can scale to large-scale graph compared to single-node GCN\naccelerator.",

    "title": "Weakly Supervised Video Salient Object Detection via Point Supervision",
    "abstract": "Video salient object detection models trained on pixel-wise dense annotation\nhave achieved excellent performance, yet obtaining pixel-by-pixel annotated\ndatasets is laborious. Several works attempt to use scribble annotations to\nmitigate this problem, but point supervision as a more labor-saving annotation\nmethod (even the most labor-saving method among manual annotation methods for\ndense prediction), has not been explored. In this paper, we propose a strong\nbaseline model based on point supervision. To infer saliency maps with temporal\ninformation, we mine inter-frame complementary information from short-term and\nlong-term perspectives, respectively. Specifically, we propose a hybrid token\nattention module, which mixes optical flow and image information from\northogonal directions, adaptively highlighting critical optical flow\ninformation (channel dimension) and critical token information (spatial\ndimension). To exploit long-term cues, we develop the Long-term Cross-Frame\nAttention module (LCFA), which assists the current frame in inferring salient\nobjects based on multi-frame tokens. Furthermore, we label two point-supervised\ndatasets, P-DAVIS and P-DAVSOD, by relabeling the DAVIS and the DAVSOD dataset.\nExperiments on the six benchmark datasets illustrate our method outperforms the\nprevious state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods and even is comparable with\nsome fully supervised approaches.

    "abstract": "This paper analyzes finite state Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with\nuncertain parameters in compact sets and re-examines results from robust MDP\nvia set-based fixed point theory. We generalize the Bellman and policy\nevaluation operators to operators that contract on the space of value functions\nand denote them as \\emph{value operators}. We generalize these value operators\nto act on the space of value function sets and denote them as \\emph{set-based\nvalue operators}. We prove that these set-based value operators are\ncontractions in the space of compact value function sets. Leveraging insights\nfrom set theory, we generalize the rectangularity condition for the Bellman\noperator from classic robust MDP literature to a \\emph{containment condition}\nfor a generic value operator, which is weaker and can be applied to a larger\nset of parameter-uncertain MDPs and contractive operators in dynamic\nprogramming and reinforcement learning. We prove that both the rectangularity\ncondition and the containment condition sufficiently ensure that the set-based\nvalue operator's fixed point set contains its own supremum and infimum\nelements. For convex and compact sets of uncertain MDP parameters, we show\nequivalence between the classic robust value function and the supremum of the\nfixed point set of the set-based Bellman operator. Under dynamically changing\nMDP parameters in compact sets, we prove a set convergence result for value\niteration, which otherwise may not converge to a single value function.",

    "abstract": "A schema-guided approach to dialogue management has been shown in recent work\nto be effective in creating robust customizable virtual agents capable of\nacting as friendly peers or task assistants. However, successful applications\nof these methods in open-ended, mixed-initiative domains remain elusive --\nparticularly within medical domains such as virtual standardized patients,\nwhere such complex interactions are commonplace -- and require more extensive\nand flexible dialogue management capabilities than previous systems provide. In\nthis paper, we describe a general-purpose schema-guided dialogue management\nframework used to develop SOPHIE, a virtual standardized cancer patient that\nallows a doctor to conveniently practice for interactions with patients. We\nconduct a crowdsourced evaluation of conversations between medical students and\nSOPHIE.

    "abstract": "With the prosperity of e-commerce industry, various modalities, e.g., vision\nand language, are utilized to describe product items. It is an enormous\nchallenge to understand such diversified data, especially via extracting the\nattribute-value pairs in text sequences with the aid of helpful image regions.\nAlthough a series of previous works have been dedicated to this task, there\nremain seldomly investigated obstacles that hinder further improvements: 1)\nParameters from up-stream single-modal pretraining are inadequately applied,\nwithout proper jointly fine-tuning in a down-stream multi-modal task. 2) To\nselect descriptive parts of images, a simple late fusion is widely applied,\nregardless of priori knowledge that language-related information should be\nencoded into a common linguistic embedding space by stronger encoders. 3) Due\nto diversity across products, their attribute sets tend to vary greatly, but\ncurrent approaches predict with an unnecessary maximal range and lead to more\npotential false positives. To address these issues, we propose in this paper a\nnovel approach to boost multi-modal e-commerce attribute value extraction via\nunified learning scheme and dynamic range minimization: 1) Firstly, a unified\nscheme is designed to jointly train a multi-modal task with pretrained\nsingle-modal parameters. 2) Secondly, a text-guided information range\nminimization method is proposed to adaptively encode descriptive parts of each\nmodality into an identical space with a powerful pretrained linguistic model.\n3) Moreover, a prototype-guided attribute range minimization method is proposed\nto first determine the proper attribute set of the current product, and then\nselect prototypes to guide the prediction of the chosen attributes. Experiments\non the popular multi-modal e-commerce benchmarks show that our approach\nachieves superior performance over the other state-of-the-art techniques.",

    "title": "Parameterization of Cross-Token Relations with Relative Positional  Encoding for Vision MLP",
    "abstract": "Vision multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) have shown promising performance in\ncomputer vision tasks, and become the main competitor of CNNs and vision\nTransformers. They use token-mixing layers to capture cross-token interactions,\nas opposed to the multi-head self-attention mechanism used by Transformers.\nHowever, the heavily parameterized token-mixing layers naturally lack\nmechanisms to capture local information and multi-granular non-local relations,\nthus their discriminative power is restrained. To tackle this issue, we propose\na new positional spacial gating unit (PoSGU). It exploits the attention\nformulations used in the classical relative positional encoding (RPE), to\nefficiently encode the cross-token relations for token mixing. It can\nsuccessfully reduce the current quadratic parameter complexity $O(N^2)$ of\nvision MLPs to $O(N)$ and $O(1)$. We experiment with two RPE mechanisms, and\nfurther propose a group-wise extension to improve their expressive power with\nthe accomplishment of multi-granular contexts. These then serve as the key\nbuilding blocks of a new type of vision MLP, referred to as PosMLP. We evaluate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed approach by conducting thorough experiments,\ndemonstrating an improved or comparable performance with reduced parameter\ncomplexity. For instance, for a model trained on ImageNet1K, we achieve a\nperformance improvement from 72.14\\% to 74.02\\% and a learnable parameter\nreduction from $19.4M$ to $18.2M$.

    "title": "X-CLIP: End-to-End Multi-grained Contrastive Learning for Video-Text  Retrieval",
    "abstract": "Video-text retrieval has been a crucial and fundamental task in multi-modal\nresearch. The development of video-text retrieval has been considerably\npromoted by large-scale multi-modal contrastive pre-training, which primarily\nfocuses on coarse-grained or fine-grained contrast. However, cross-grained\ncontrast, which is the contrast between coarse-grained representations and\nfine-grained representations, has rarely been explored in prior research.\nCompared with fine-grained or coarse-grained contrasts, cross-grained contrast\ncalculate the correlation between coarse-grained features and each fine-grained\nfeature, and is able to filter out the unnecessary fine-grained features guided\nby the coarse-grained feature during similarity calculation, thus improving the\naccuracy of retrieval. To this end, this paper presents a novel multi-grained\ncontrastive model, namely X-CLIP, for video-text retrieval. However, another\nchallenge lies in the similarity aggregation problem, which aims to aggregate\nfine-grained and cross-grained similarity matrices to instance-level\nsimilarity. To address this challenge, we propose the Attention Over Similarity\nMatrix (AOSM) module to make the model focus on the contrast between essential\nframes and words, thus lowering the impact of unnecessary frames and words on\nretrieval results. With multi-grained contrast and the proposed AOSM module,\nX-CLIP achieves outstanding performance on five widely-used video-text\nretrieval datasets, including MSR-VTT (49.3 R@1), MSVD (50.4 R@1), LSMDC (26.1\nR@1), DiDeMo (47.8 R@1) and ActivityNet (46.2 R@1). It outperforms the previous\nstate-of-theart by +6.3%, +6.6%, +11.1%, +6.7%, +3.8% relative improvements on\nthese benchmarks, demonstrating the superiority of multi-grained contrast and\nAOSM.",

    "abstract": "Existing few-shot image generation approaches typically employ fusion-based\nstrategies, either on the image or the feature level, to produce new images.\nHowever, previous approaches struggle to synthesize high-frequency signals with\nfine details, deteriorating the synthesis quality. To address this, we propose\nWaveGAN, a frequency-aware model for few-shot image generation. Concretely, we\ndisentangle encoded features into multiple frequency components and perform\nlow-frequency skip connections to preserve outline and structural information.\nThen we alleviate the generator's struggles of synthesizing fine details by\nemploying high-frequency skip connections, thus providing informative frequency\ninformation to the generator. Moreover, we utilize a frequency L1-loss on the\ngenerated and real images to further impede frequency information loss.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and advancement of our\nmethod on three datasets.

In radio communication and avionics, a conformal antenna\nor conformal array is a flat radio antenna which is designed to conform to or\nfollow some prescribed shape, for example, a curved conformal antenna is\ndesigned and is mounted on or embedded in a curved surface. The conformal\nantenna is a collection of a large number of smaller antennas (PAA) each one is\nconnected to a phase shifter. The phased array antenna will have high\ndirectivity in the desired application. Conformal arrays are typically limited\nto high frequencies in the UHF or microwave range, where the wavelength of the\nwaves is small enough that small antennas can be used. The main objective of\nthis project is to embed this conformal antenna on the surface of the aircraft\nwith increased gain. To implement the above-mentioned problem we are using CST\nmicrowave software. Conventional methods now used in aircraft are done by using\nthe conformal antenna to save space and even military applications to be\nanonymous.

    "abstract": "Recently privacy concerns of person re-identification (ReID) raise more and\nmore attention and preserving the privacy of the pedestrian images used by ReID\nmethods become essential. De-identification (DeID) methods alleviate privacy\nissues by removing the identity-related of the ReID data. However, most of the\nexisting DeID methods tend to remove all personal identity-related information\nand compromise the usability of de-identified data on the ReID task. In this\npaper, we aim to develop a technique that can achieve a good trade-off between\nprivacy protection and data usability for person ReID. To achieve this, we\npropose a novel de-identification method designed explicitly for person ReID,\nnamed Person Identify Shift (PIS). PIS removes the absolute identity in a\npedestrian image while preserving the identity relationship between image\npairs. By exploiting the interpolation property of variational auto-encoder,\nPIS shifts each pedestrian image from the current identity to another with a\nnew identity, resulting in images still preserving the relative identities.\nExperimental results show that our method has a better trade-off between\nprivacy-preserving and model performance than existing de-identification\nmethods and can defend against human and model attacks for data privacy.",

    "abstract": "Face recognition technology has been used in many fields due to its high\nrecognition accuracy, including the face unlocking of mobile devices, community\naccess control systems, and city surveillance. As the current high accuracy is\nguaranteed by very deep network structures, facial images often need to be\ntransmitted to third-party servers with high computational power for inference.\nHowever, facial images visually reveal the user's identity information. In this\nprocess, both untrusted service providers and malicious users can significantly\nincrease the risk of a personal privacy breach. Current privacy-preserving\napproaches to face recognition are often accompanied by many side effects, such\nas a significant increase in inference time or a noticeable decrease in\nrecognition accuracy. This paper proposes a privacy-preserving face recognition\nmethod using differential privacy in the frequency domain. Due to the\nutilization of differential privacy, it offers a guarantee of privacy in\ntheory. Meanwhile, the loss of accuracy is very slight. This method first\nconverts the original image to the frequency domain and removes the direct\ncomponent termed DC. Then a privacy budget allocation method can be learned\nbased on the loss of the back-end face recognition network within the\ndifferential privacy framework. Finally, it adds the corresponding noise to the\nfrequency domain features. Our method performs very well with several classical\nface recognition test sets according to the extensive experiments.",

Motivated by this, several personalized\nenhancement methods have been investigated.

In this work, we propose an intelligible unsupervised personalized\nenhancer (iUPEnhancer) for low-light images, which establishes the correlations\nbetween the low-light and the unpaired reference images with regard to three\nuser-friendly attributions (brightness, chromaticity, and noise). The proposed\niUP-Enhancer is trained with the guidance of these correlations and the\ncorresponding unsupervised loss functions. Rather than a \"black box\" process,\nour iUP-Enhancer presents an intelligible enhancement process with the above\nattributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm\nproduces competitive qualitative and quantitative results while maintaining\nexcellent flexibility and scalability.

For\nfuzzy labeling, the argument strength is represented as a triple consisting of\nacceptability, rejectability, and undecidability degree.

This paper presents DuetFace, a\nnovel privacy-preserving face recognition method that employs collaborative\ninference in the frequency domain. Starting from a counterintuitive discovery\nthat face recognition can achieve surprisingly good performance with only\nvisually indistinguishable high-frequency channels, this method designs a\ncredible split of frequency channels by their cruciality for visualization and\noperates the server-side model on non-crucial channels.

To compensate, the method introduces a plug-in interactive block\nto allow attention transfer from the client-side by producing a feature mask.\nThe mask is further refined by deriving and overlaying a facial region of\ninterest (ROI). Extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method in protecting face images from undesired\nvisual inspection, reconstruction, and identification while maintaining high\ntask availability and performance.

We resolve this question in the negative by proving that there\nexist $6$-terminal networks $G$ whose flow sparsifiers $G'$ must have\narbitrarily large size. This unboundedness is perhaps surprising, since the\nanalogous sparsification that preserves all terminal cuts (called exact cut\nsparsifier or mimicking network) admits sparsifiers of size $f_0(k)\\leq\n2^{2^k}$ [Hagerup, Katajainen, Nishimura, and Ragde, JCSS 1998].\nWe prove our results by analyzing the set of all feasible demands in the\nnetwork, known as the demand polytope. We identify an invariant of this\npolytope, essentially the slope of certain facets, that can be made arbitrarily\nlarge even for $k=6$, and implies an explicit lower bound on the size of the\nnetwork. We further use this technique to answer, again in the negative, an\nopen question of Seymour [JCTB 2015] regarding flow-sparsification that uses\nonly contractions and preserves the infeasibility of one demand vector.",

    "abstract": "Technology has become an essential part of our everyday life, and its use in\neducational environments keeps growing. In addition, games are one of the most\npopular activities across cultures and ages, and there is ample evidence that\nsupports the benefits of using games for assessment. This field is commonly\nknown as game-based assessment (GBA), which refers to the use of games to\nassess learners' competencies, skills, or knowledge. This paper analyzes the\ncurrent status of the GBA field by performing the first systematic literature\nreview on empirical GBA studies, based on 66 research papers that used digital\nGBAs to determine: (1) the context where the study has been applied, (2) the\nprimary purpose, (3) the knowledge domain of the game used, (4) game/tool\navailability, (5) the size of the data sample, (6) the data science techniques\nand algorithms applied, (7) the targeted stakeholders of the study, and (8)\nwhat limitations and challenges are reported by authors. Based on the\ncategories established and our analysis, the findings suggest that GBAs are\nmainly used in formal education and for assessment purposes, and most GBAs\nfocus on assessing STEM content and cognitive skills. Furthermore, the current\nlimitations indicate that future GBA research would benefit from the use of\nbigger data samples and more specialized algorithms. Based on our results, we\ndiscuss the status of the field with the current trends and the open challenges\n(including replication and validation problems) providing recommendations for\nthe future research agenda of the GBA field.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a 3D instance representation, termed instance kernels, where\ninstances are represented by one-dimensional vectors that encode the semantic,\npositional, and shape information of 3D instances. We show that instance\nkernels enable easy mask inference by simply scanning kernels over the entire\nscenes, avoiding the heavy reliance on proposals or heuristic clustering\nalgorithms in standard 3D instance segmentation pipelines. The idea of instance\nkernel is inspired by recent success of dynamic convolutions in 2D/3D instance\nsegmentation. However, we find it non-trivial to represent 3D instances due to\nthe disordered and unstructured nature of point cloud data, e.g., poor instance\nlocalization can significantly degrade instance representation. To remedy this,\nwe construct a novel 3D instance encoding paradigm. First, potential instance\ncentroids are localized as candidates. Then, a candidate merging scheme is\ndevised to simultaneously aggregate duplicated candidates and collect context\naround the merged centroids to form the instance kernels. Once instance kernels\nare available, instance masks can be reconstructed via dynamic convolutions\nwhose weights are conditioned on instance kernels. The whole pipeline is\ninstantiated with a dynamic kernel network (DKNet). Results show that DKNet\noutperforms the state of the arts on both ScanNetV2 and S3DIS datasets with\nbetter instance localization. Code is available:\nhttps://github.com/W1zheng/DKNet.",

    "abstract": "Multi-person motion capture can be challenging due to ambiguities caused by\nsevere occlusion, fast body movement, and complex interactions. Existing\nframeworks build on 2D pose estimations and triangulate to 3D coordinates via\nreasoning the appearance, trajectory, and geometric consistencies among\nmulti-camera observations. However, 2D joint detection is usually incomplete\nand with wrong identity assignments due to limited observation angle, which\nleads to noisy 3D triangulation results. To overcome this issue, we propose to\nexplore the short-range autoregressive characteristics of skeletal motion using\ntransformer. First, we propose an adaptive, identity-aware triangulation module\nto reconstruct 3D joints and identify the missing joints for each identity. To\ngenerate complete 3D skeletal motion, we then propose a Dual-Masked\nAuto-Encoder (D-MAE) which encodes the joint status with both\nskeletal-structural and temporal position encoding for trajectory completion.\nD-MAE's flexible masking and encoding mechanism enable arbitrary skeleton\ndefinitions to be conveniently deployed under the same framework. In order to\ndemonstrate the proposed model's capability in dealing with severe data loss\nscenarios, we contribute a high-accuracy and challenging motion capture dataset\nof multi-person interactions with severe occlusion. Evaluations on both\nbenchmark and our new dataset demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed model,\nas well as its advantage against the other state-of-the-art methods.",

First, the\naesthetic styles and messages conveyed by the motion and music should be\nconsistent. Second, the beats of the generated motion should be locally aligned\nto the musical features. And finally, basic choreomusical rules should be\nobserved, and the motion generated should be diverse. To address these\nchallenges, we propose ChoreoGraph, which choreographs high-quality dance\nmotion for a given piece of music over a Dynamic Graph. A data-driven learning\nstrategy is proposed to evaluate the aesthetic style and rhythmic connections\nbetween music and motion in a progressively learned cross-modality embedding\nspace. The motion sequences will be beats-aligned based on the music segments\nand then incorporated as nodes of a Dynamic Motion Graph. Compatibility factors\nsuch as the style and tempo consistency, motion context connection, action\ncompleteness, and transition smoothness are comprehensively evaluated to\ndetermine the node transition in the graph.

Consequently,\nconventional adaptive streaming methodologies often find themselves\nunsatisfactory to meet the requirements in threefold: 1) current algorithms\nreuse existing quality of experience (QoE) definitions while overlooking the\nunique features of point cloud video thus failing to provide optimal user\nexperience, 2) most deep learning approaches require long-span data collections\nto learn sufficiently varied network conditions and result in long training\nperiod and capacity occupation, 3) cloud training approaches pose privacy risks\ncaused by leakage of user reported service usage and networking conditions.\nTo overcome the limitations, we present FRAS, the first federated\nreinforcement learning framework, to the best of our knowledge, for adaptive\npoint cloud video streaming. We define a new QoE model which takes the unique\nfeatures of point cloud video into account. Each client uses reinforcement\nlearning (RL) to train encoding rate selection with the objective of optimizing\nthe user's QoE under multiple constraints. Then, a federated learning framework\nis integrated with the RL algorithm to enhance training performance with\nprivacy preservation.

    "abstract": "Complex networks are graphs representing real-life systems that exhibit\nunique characteristics not found in purely regular or completely random graphs.\nThe study of such systems is vital but challenging due to the complexity of the\nunderlying processes. This task has nevertheless been made easier in recent\ndecades thanks to the availability of large amounts of networked data. Link\nprediction in complex networks aims to estimate the likelihood that a link\nbetween two nodes is missing from the network. Links can be missing due to\nimperfections in data collection or simply because they are yet to appear.\nDiscovering new relationships between entities in networked data has attracted\nresearchers' attention in various domains such as sociology, computer science,\nphysics, and biology. Most existing research focuses on link prediction in\nundirected complex networks. However, not all real-life systems can be\nfaithfully represented as undirected networks. This simplifying assumption is\noften made when using link prediction algorithms but inevitably leads to loss\nof information about relations among nodes and degradation in prediction\nperformance. This paper introduces a link prediction method designed explicitly\nfor directed networks. It is based on the similarity-popularity paradigm, which\nhas recently proven successful in undirected networks. The presented algorithms\nhandle the asymmetry in node relationships by modeling it as asymmetry in\nsimilarity and popularity. Given the observed network topology, the algorithms\napproximate the hidden similarities as shortest path distances using edge\nweights that capture and factor out the links' asymmetry and nodes' popularity.\nThe proposed approach is evaluated on real-life networks, and the experimental\nresults demonstrate its effectiveness in predicting missing links across a\nbroad spectrum of networked data types and sizes.",

This paper examines the association between performance &\nperception & the potential effects that tactile feedback modalities could\ngenerate. This paper reports a user study (N=24), in which participants\nperformed a Fitts's law target acquisition task by using three feedback\nmodalities: visual, visuo-electrotactile, & visuo-vibrotactile. The users\ncompleted 3 Target Sizes X 2 Distances X 3 feedback modalities = 18 trials. The\nsize perception, distance perception, & (movement) time perception were\nassessed at the end of each trial. Performance-wise, the results showed that\nelectrotactile feedback facilitates a significantly better accuracy compared to\nvibrotactile & visual feedback, while vibrotactile provided the worst accuracy.\nElectrotactile & visual feedback enabled a comparable reaction time, while the\nvibrotactile offered a substantially slower reaction time than visual feedback.\nAlthough amongst feedback types the pattern of differences in perceptual\naspects were comparable to performance differences, none of them was\nstatistically significant. However, performance indeed modulated perception.\nSignificant action-specific effects on spatial & time perception were detected.\nChanges in accuracy modulate both size perception & time perception, while\nchanges in movement speed modulate distance perception. Also, the index of\ndifficulty was found to modulate perception. These outcomes highlighted the\nimportance of haptic feedback on performance, & importantly the significance of\naction-specific effects on spatial & time perception in VR, which should be\nconsidered in future VR studies.",

The key idea of ERIC is to use physical unclonable functions (PUFs),\nunique device identifiers, as secret keys in encrypting software executables.\nMalicious parties that cannot access the PUF in the target device cannot\nperform static or dynamic analyses on the encrypted binary.

In this paper, we explore the reliability of\nmodels, where we define a reliable model as one that not only achieves strong\npredictive performance but also performs well consistently over many\ndecision-making tasks involving uncertainty (e.g., selective prediction, open\nset recognition), robust generalization (e.g., accuracy and proper scoring\nrules such as log-likelihood on in- and out-of-distribution datasets), and\nadaptation (e.g., active learning, few-shot uncertainty). We devise 10 types of\ntasks over 40 datasets in order to evaluate different aspects of reliability on\nboth vision and language domains. To improve reliability, we developed ViT-Plex\nand T5-Plex, pretrained large model extensions for vision and language\nmodalities, respectively. Plex greatly improves the state-of-the-art across\nreliability tasks, and simplifies the traditional protocol as it improves the\nout-of-the-box performance and does not require designing scores or tuning the\nmodel for each task. We demonstrate scaling effects over model sizes up to 1B\nparameters and pretraining dataset sizes up to 4B examples. We also demonstrate\nPlex's capabilities on challenging tasks including zero-shot open set\nrecognition, active learning, and uncertainty in conversational language\nunderstanding.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new type of attack on isolated, air-gapped\nworkstations. Although air-gap computers have no wireless connectivity, we show\nthat attackers can use the SATA cable as a wireless antenna to transfer radio\nsignals at the 6 GHz frequency band. The Serial ATA (SATA) is a bus interface\nwidely used in modern computers and connects the host bus to mass storage\ndevices such as hard disk drives, optical drives, and solid-state drives. The\nprevalence of the SATA interface makes this attack highly available to\nattackers in a wide range of computer systems and IT environments. We discuss\nrelated work on this topic and provide technical background. We show the design\nof the transmitter and receiver and present the implementation of these\ncomponents. We also demonstrate the attack on different computers and provide\nthe evaluation. The results show that attackers can use the SATA cable to\ntransfer a brief amount of sensitive information from highly secured, air-gap\ncomputers wirelessly to a nearby receiver. Furthermore, we show that the attack\ncan operate from user mode, is effective even from inside a Virtual Machine\n(VM), and can successfully work with other running workloads in the background.\nFinally, we discuss defense and mitigation techniques for this new air-gap\nattack.",

For each mode of $U_v$ corresponding\nto an edge incident to $v$, the dimension is $k$, and we wish to find $U_v$\nsuch that the Frobenius norm distance between $T$ and $A$ is minimized. This\ngeneralizes a number of well-known tensor network decompositions, such as the\nTensor Train, Tensor Ring, Tucker, and PEPS decompositions. We approximate $A$\nby a binary tree network $T'$ with $O(q)$ cores, such that the dimension on\neach edge of this network is at most $\\widetilde{O}(k^{O(dt)} \\cdot\nq/\\varepsilon)$, where $d$ is the maximum degree of $G$ and $t$ is its\ntreewidth, such that $\\|A - T'\\|_F^2 \\leq (1 + \\varepsilon) \\|A - T\\|_F^2$.

Our algorithm is based on a new dimensionality\nreduction technique for tensor decomposition which may be of independent\ninterest.\nWe also develop fixed-parameter tractable $(1 + \\varepsilon)$-approximation\nalgorithms for Tensor Train and Tucker decompositions, improving the running\ntime of Song, Woodruff and Zhong (SODA, 2019) and avoiding the use of generic\npolynomial system solvers. We show that our algorithms have a nearly optimal\ndependence on $1/\\varepsilon$ assuming that there is no $O(1)$-approximation\nalgorithm for the $2 \\to 4$ norm with better running time than brute force.\nFinally, we give additional results for Tucker decomposition with robust loss\nfunctions, and fixed-parameter tractable CP decomposition.",

    "abstract": "We study the parameterized problem of satisfying ``almost all'' constraints\nof a given formula $F$ over a fixed, finite Boolean constraint language\n$\\Gamma$, with or without weights. More precisely, for each finite Boolean\nconstraint language $\\Gamma$, we consider the following two problems. In Min\nSAT$(\\Gamma)$, the input is a formula $F$ over $\\Gamma$ and an integer $k$, and\nthe task is to find an assignment $\\alpha \\colon V(F) \\to \\{0,1\\}$ that\nsatisfies all but at most $k$ constraints of $F$, or determine that no such\nassignment exists. In Weighted Min SAT$(\\Gamma$), the input additionally\ncontains a weight function $w \\colon F \\to \\mathbb{Z}_+$ and an integer $W$,\nand the task is to find an assignment $\\alpha$ such that (1) $\\alpha$ satisfies\nall but at most $k$ constraints of $F$, and (2) the total weight of the\nviolated constraints is at most $W$. We give a complete dichotomy for the\nfixed-parameter tractability of these problems: We show that for every Boolean\nconstraint language $\\Gamma$, either Weighted Min SAT$(\\Gamma)$ is FPT; or\nWeighted Min SAT$(\\Gamma)$ is W[1]-hard but Min SAT$(\\Gamma)$ is FPT; or Min\nSAT$(\\Gamma)$ is W[1]-hard.

The main tool used in our\nalgorithms is the recently developed method of directed flow-augmentation (Kim\net al., STOC 2022).",

    "abstract": "We show fixed-parameter tractability of the Directed Multicut problem with\nthree terminal pairs (with a randomized algorithm). This problem, given a\ndirected graph $G$, pairs of vertices (called terminals) $(s_1,t_1)$,\n$(s_2,t_2)$, and $(s_3,t_3)$, and an integer $k$, asks to find a set of at most\n$k$ non-terminal vertices in $G$ that intersect all $s_1t_1$-paths, all\n$s_2t_2$-paths, and all $s_3t_3$-paths. The parameterized complexity of this\ncase has been open since Chitnis, Cygan, Hajiaghayi, and Marx proved\nfixed-parameter tractability of the 2-terminal-pairs case at SODA 2012, and\nPilipczuk and Wahlstr\\\"{o}m proved the W[1]-hardness of the 4-terminal-pairs\ncase at SODA 2016.\nOn the technical side, we use two recent developments in parameterized\nalgorithms. Using the technique of directed flow-augmentation [Kim, Kratsch,\nPilipczuk, Wahlstr\\\"{o}m, STOC 2022] we cast the problem as a CSP problem with\nfew variables and constraints over a large ordered domain.We observe that this\nproblem can be in turn encoded as an FO model-checking task over a structure\nconsisting of a few 0-1 matrices. We look at this problem through the lenses of\ntwin-width, a recently introduced structural parameter [Bonnet, Kim,\nThomass\\'{e}, Watrigant, FOCS 2020]: By a recent characterization [Bonnet,\nGiocanti, Ossona de Mendes, Simon, Thomass\\'{e}, Toru\\'{n}czyk, STOC 2022] the\nsaid FO model-checking task can be done in FPT time if the said matrices have\nbounded grid rank. To complete the proof, we show an irrelevant vertex rule: If\nany of the matrices in the said encoding has a large grid minor, a vertex\ncorresponding to the ``middle'' box in the grid minor can be proclaimed\nirrelevant -- not contained in the sought solution -- and thus reduced.",

The problem asks to disconnect the graph at minimum cost.\nWhile the $st$-cut version of the problem is known to be NP-hard, the above\nglobal cut version is known to admit a quasi-polynomial randomized $n^{O(\\log\n\\mathrm{OPT})}$-time algorithm due to Ghaffari, Karger, and Panigrahi [SODA\n2017]. They consider this as ``strong evidence that this problem is in P''. We\nshow that this is actually not the case. We complete the study of the\ncomplexity of the Global Label Min-Cut problem by showing that the\nquasi-polynomial running time is probably optimal: We show that the existence\nof an algorithm with running time $(np)^{o(\\log n/ (\\log \\log n)^2)}$ would\ncontradict the Exponential Time Hypothesis, where $n$ is the number of\nvertices, and $p$ is the number of labels in the input. The key step for the\nlower bound is a proof that Global Label Min-Cut is W[1]-hard when\nparameterized by the number of uncut labels. In other words, the problem is\ndifficult in the regime where almost all labels need to be cut to disconnect\nthe graph. To turn this lower bound into a quasi-polynomial-time lower bound,\nwe also needed to revisit the framework due to Marx [Theory Comput. 2010] of\nproving lower bounds assuming Exponential Time Hypothesis through the Subgraph\nIsomorphism problem parameterized by the number of edges of the pattern.

Moreover, with the option to use a pretrained language\nmodel as the language encoder, our model has the potential to recognise unseen\nnatural language input. Another capability of our model is that it can\nrecognise and imitate actions of another agent by utilising robot\ndemonstrations.

The standard way to mitigate computational issues arising\nfrom the high-dimensionality of the data is by applying some dimension\nreduction technique that preserves the structural properties of the ambient\nspace. The dissimilarity between two time series is often measured by\n``discrete'' notions of distance, e.g. the dynamic time warping, or the\ndiscrete Fr\\'echet distance, or simply the Euclidean distance. Since all these\ndistance functions are computed directly on the points of a time series, they\nare sensitive to different sampling rates or gaps. The continuous Fr\\'echet\ndistance offers a popular alternative which aims to alleviate this by taking\ninto account all points on the polygonal curve obtained by linearly\ninterpolating between any two consecutive points in a sequence.\nWe study the ability of random projections \\`a la Johnson and Lindenstrauss\nto preserve the continuous Fr\\'echet distance of polygonal curves by\neffectively reducing the dimension.

    "abstract": "Electronic voting consistently fails to supplant conventional paper ballot\ndue to a plethora of security shortcomings. Not only are traditional voting\nmethods mediocre in terms of convenience and interface, they also encompass\nprincipal-agent problem, where the state may have vested interest in the\noutcome of the ballot. Electronic voting protocol using cryptography to deliver\nin zero trust environments is long overdue. Here I propose using Proof of Work\nalgorithm at user devices in combination with other well-known security\nprimitives to build a zero-trust voting system. The state would only issue\nsingle-use voting authorizations to its citizens, while zero trust design would\nallow conducting elections by an open-source platform with enhanced\nobservability.

    "abstract": "We introduce a general method for obtaining fixed-parameter algorithms for\nproblems about finding paths in undirected graphs, where the length of the path\ncould be unbounded in the parameter. The first application of our method is as\nfollows.\nWe give a randomized algorithm, that given a colored $n$-vertex undirected\ngraph, vertices $s$ and $t$, and an integer $k$, finds an $(s,t)$-path\ncontaining at least $k$ different colors in time $2^k n^{O(1)}$. This is the\nfirst FPT algorithm for this problem, and it generalizes the algorithm of\nBj\\\"orklund, Husfeldt, and Taslaman [SODA 2012] on finding a path through $k$\nspecified vertices. It also implies the first $2^k n^{O(1)}$ time algorithm for\nfinding an $(s,t)$-path of length at least $k$.\nOur method yields FPT algorithms for even more general problems. For example,\nwe consider the problem where the input consists of an $n$-vertex undirected\ngraph $G$, a matroid $M$ whose elements correspond to the vertices of $G$ and\nwhich is represented over a finite field of order $q$, a positive integer\nweight function on the vertices of $G$, two sets of vertices $S,T \\subseteq\nV(G)$, and integers $p,k,w$, and the task is to find $p$ vertex-disjoint paths\nfrom $S$ to $T$ so that the union of the vertices of these paths contains an\nindependent set of $M$ of cardinality $k$ and weight $w$, while minimizing the\nsum of the lengths of the paths.

Due to unique design concepts and outstanding performance, blockchain\nhas become a popular research topic in industry and academia in recent years.\nEvery participant is anonymous in a permissionless blockchain represented by\ncryptocurrency applications such as Bitcoin. In this situation, some special\nincentive mechanisms are applied to permissionless blockchain, such as mined\nnative cryptocurrency to solve the trust issues of permissionless blockchain.\nIn many use cases, permissionless blockchain has bottlenecks in transaction\nthroughput performance, which restricts further application in the real world.\nA permissioned blockchain can reach a consensus among a group of entities that\ndo not establish an entire trust relationship.

Indeed, in\nthe absence of measurements, estimating the distributed PV generation is tough.\nIn recent years, many remote sensing-based approaches have been proposed to map\ndistributed PV installations. However, to be applicable in industrial settings,\none needs to assess the accuracy of the mapping over the whole deployment area.\nWe build on existing work to propose an automated PV registry pipeline. This\npipeline automatically generates a dataset recording all distributed PV\ninstallations' location, area, installed capacity, and tilt angle. It only\nrequires aerial orthoimagery and topological data, both of which are freely\naccessible online. In order to assess the accuracy of the registry, we propose\nan unsupervised method based on the {\\it Registre national d'installation}\n(RNI), that centralizes all individual PV systems aggregated at communal level,\nenabling practitioners to assess the accuracy of the registry and eventually\nremove outliers. We deploy our model on 9 French {\\it d\\'epartements} covering\nmore than 50 000 square kilometers, providing the largest mapping of\ndistributed PV panels with this level of detail to date.

The matching\nproblem, i.e., deciding whether a given pattern matches a given word, was\nheavily investigated: it is NP-complete in general, but can be solved\nefficiently for classes of patterns with restricted structure. If we are\ninterested in what is the minimum Hamming distance between $w$ and any word $u$\nobtained by replacing the variables of $\\alpha$ by terminal words (so matching\nunder Hamming distance), one can devise efficient algorithms and matching\nconditional lower bounds for the class of regular patterns (in which no\nvariable occurs twice), as well as for classes of patterns where we allow\nunbounded repetitions of variables, but restrict the structure of the pattern,\ni.e., the way the occurrences of different variables can be interleaved.\nMoreover, under Hamming distance, if a variable occurs more than once and its\noccurrences can be interleaved arbitrarily with those of other variables, even\nif each of these occurs just once, the matching problem is intractable. In this\npaper, we consider the problem of matching patterns with variables under edit\ndistance. We still obtain efficient algorithms and matching conditional lower\nbounds for the class of regular patterns, but show that the problem becomes, in\nthis case, intractable already for unary patterns, consisting of repeated\noccurrences of a single variable interleaved with terminals.",

Yet, even the simplest microprocessors\nimplement pipelines with concurrently-accessed resources, such as the memory\nbus shared by fetch and memory stages. Although their in-order pipelines are,\nby nature, very deterministic, the bus can cause out-of-order accesses to the\nmemory and, therefore, timing anomalies: local timing effects that can have\nglobal effects but that cannot be easily composed to estimate the global WCET.\nTo cope with this situation, WCET analyses have to generate important\nover-estimations in order to preserve safety of the computed times or have to\nexplicitly track all possible executions. In the latter case, the presence of\nout-of-order behavior leads to a combinatorial blowup of the number of pipeline\nstates for which efficient state abstractions are difficult to design. This\npaper proposes instead a compact and exact representation of the timings in the\npipeline, using eXecution Decision Diagram (XDD) [1]. We show how XDD can be\nused to model pipeline states all along the execution paths by leveraging the\nalgebraic properties of XDD. This computational model allows to compute the\nexact temporal behavior at control flow graph level and is amenable to\nefficiently and precisely support WCET calculation in presence of out-of-order\nbus accesses.

In the original publication, BERT4Rec claimed\nsuperiority over other available sequential recommendation approaches (e.g.\nSASRec), and it is now frequently being used as a state-of-the art baseline for\nsequential recommendations. However, not all subsequent publications confirmed\nthis result and proposed other models that were shown to outperform BERT4Rec in\neffectiveness. In this paper we systematically review all publications that\ncompare BERT4Rec with another popular Transformer-based model, namely SASRec,\nand show that BERT4Rec results are not consistent within these publications. To\nunderstand the reasons behind this inconsistency, we analyse the available\nimplementations of BERT4Rec and show that we fail to reproduce results of the\noriginal BERT4Rec publication when using their default configuration\nparameters. However, we are able to replicate the reported results with the\noriginal code if training for a much longer amount of time (up to 30x) compared\nto the default configuration. We also propose our own implementation of\nBERT4Rec based on the Hugging Face Transformers library, which we demonstrate\nreplicates the originally reported results on 3 out 4 datasets, while requiring\nup to 95% less training time to converge. Overall, from our systematic review\nand detailed experiments, we conclude that BERT4Rec does indeed exhibit\nstate-of-the-art effectiveness for sequential recommendation, but only when\ntrained for a sufficient amount of time. Additionally, we show that our\nimplementation can further benefit from adapting other Transformer\narchitectures that are available in the Hugging Face Transformers library (e.g.\nusing disentangled attention, as provided by DeBERTa, or larger hidden layer\nsize cf.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and analysis of DNS\nover CoAP (DoC), a new proposal for secure and privacy-friendly name resolution\nof constrained IoT devices. We implement different design choices of DoC in\nRIOT, an open-source operating system for the IoT, evaluate performance\nmeasures in a testbed, compare with DNS over UDP and DNS over DTLS, and\nvalidate our protocol design based on empirical DNS IoT data. Our findings\nindicate that plain DoC is on par with common DNS solutions for the constrained\nIoT but significantly outperforms when additional, CoAP standard features are\nused such as block-wise transfer or caching. With OSCORE for end-to-end\nsecurity, we can save more than 10 kBytes of code memory compared to DTLS while\nenabling group communication without compromising the trust chain when using\nintermediate proxies or caches. We also discuss a scheme for very restricted\nlinks that compresses redundant or excessive information by up to 70%.",

    "abstract": "Flapping wings are a bio-inspired method to produce lift and thrust in aerial\nrobots, leading to quiet and efficient motion. The advantages of this\ntechnology are safety and maneuverability, and physical interaction with the\nenvironment, humans, and animals. However, to enable substantial applications,\nthese robots must perch and land. Despite recent progress in the perching\nfield, flapping-wing vehicles, or ornithopters, are to this day unable to stop\ntheir flight on a branch. In this paper, we present a novel method that defines\na process to reliably and autonomously land an ornithopter on a branch. This\nmethod describes the joint operation of a flapping-flight controller, a\nclose-range correction system and a passive claw appendage. Flight is handled\nby a triple pitch-yaw-altitude controller and integrated body electronics,\npermitting perching at 3 m/s. The close-range correction system, with fast\noptical branch sensing compensates for position misalignment when landing. This\nis complemented by a passive bistable claw design can lock and hold 2 Nm of\ntorque, grasp within 25 ms and can re-open thanks to an integrated tendon\nactuation. The perching method is supplemented by a four-step experimental\ndevelopment process which optimizes for a successful design. We validate this\nmethod with a 700 g ornithopter and demonstrate the first autonomous perching\nflight of a flapping-wing robot on a branch, a result replicated with a second\nrobot. This work paves the way towards the application of flapping-wing robots\nfor long-range missions, bird observation, manipulation, and outdoor flight.",

Leveraging the crypto\ndonations to a Ukrainian fundraising plea that accepts Ether (i.e., the\ncurrency of the Ethereum blockchain) and Bitcoin (i.e., the currency of the\nBitcoin blockchain) over a seven-day period, we analyze the impact of crypto\nrewards that lasted for more than 24 hours. Crypto rewards are newly minted\ntokens that are usually valueless initially and grow in value if the\ncorresponding cause is well received. Separately, we find that crypto rewards\nhave a positive impact on the donation count but a negative impact on the\naverage donation size for donations from both blockchains. Comparatively, we\nfurther find that the crypto rewards lead to an 812.48% stronger donation count\nincrease for Ethereum than Bitcoin, given that the crypto rewards are more\nlikely to be issued on the Ethereum blockchain, which has higher\nprogrammability to support smart contracts. We also find a 30.1% stronger\ndecrease in average donation amount from Ethereum for small donations (<=$250);\nthe rewards pose similar impacts on the average donation size for the two\nblockchains for large donations (>$250).

However, in FL, users with\nnon-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) characteristics can\ndeteriorate the performance of the global model. Specifically, the global model\nsuffers from the weight divergence challenge owing to non-IID data. To address\nthe aforementioned challenge, we propose a novel diffusion strategy of the\nmachine learning (ML) model (FedDif) to maximize the FL performance with\nnon-IID data. In FedDif, users spread local models to neighboring users over\nD2D communications. FedDif enables the local model to experience different\ndistributions before parameter aggregation. Furthermore, we theoretically\ndemonstrate that FedDif can circumvent the weight divergence challenge. On the\ntheoretical basis, we propose the communication-efficient diffusion strategy of\nthe ML model, which can determine the trade-off between the learning\nperformance and communication cost based on auction theory. The performance\nevaluation results show that FedDif improves the test accuracy of the global\nmodel by 11% compared to the baseline FL with non-IID settings. Moreover,\nFedDif improves communication efficiency in perspective of the number of\ntransmitted sub-frames and models by 2.77 folds than the latest methods",

Although it might be\nnot necessary to require the drivers to intervene on most occasions, it is\nstill important to improve drivers' situation awareness (SA) in unexpected\ndriving scenarios to improve their trust in and acceptance of AVs. In this\nstudy, we conceptualized SA at the levels of perception (SA L1), comprehension\n(SA L2), and projection (SA L3), and proposed an SA level-based explanation\nframework based on explainable AI. Then, we examined the effects of these\nexplanations and their modalities on drivers' situational trust, cognitive\nworkload, as well as explanation satisfaction. A three (SA levels: SA L1, SA L2\nand SA L3) by two (explanation modalities: visual, visual + audio)\nbetween-subjects experiment was conducted with 340 participants recruited from\nAmazon Mechanical Turk. The results indicated that by designing the\nexplanations using the proposed SA-based framework, participants could redirect\ntheir attention to the important objects in the traffic and understand their\nmeaning for the AV system. This improved their SA and filled the gap of\nunderstanding the correspondence of AV's behavior in the particular situations\nwhich also increased their situational trust in AV. The results showed that\nparticipants reported the highest trust with SA L2 explanations, although the\nmental workload was assessed higher in this level. The results also provided\ninsights into the relationship between the amount of information in\nexplanations and modalities, showing that participants were more satisfied with\nvisual-only explanations in the SA L1 and SA L2 conditions and were more\nsatisfied with visual and auditory explanations in the SA L3 condition.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are becoming increasingly essential infrastructures in\nmany applications while suffering from incompleteness issues. The KG completion\ntask (KGC) automatically predicts missing facts based on an incomplete KG.\nHowever, existing methods perform unsatisfactorily in real-world scenarios. On\nthe one hand, their performance will dramatically degrade along with the\nincreasing sparsity of KGs. On the other hand, the inference procedure for\nprediction is an untrustworthy black box.\nThis paper proposes a novel explainable model for sparse KGC, compositing\nhigh-order reasoning into a graph convolutional network, namely HoGRN. It can\nnot only improve the generalization ability to mitigate the information\ninsufficiency issue but also provide interpretability while maintaining the\nmodel's effectiveness and efficiency. There are two main components that are\nseamlessly integrated for joint optimization. First, the high-order reasoning\ncomponent learns high-quality relation representations by capturing endogenous\ncorrelation among relations. This can reflect logical rules to justify a\nbroader of missing facts. Second, the entity updating component leverages a\nweight-free Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to efficiently model KG\nstructures with interpretability. Unlike conventional methods, we conduct\nentity aggregation and design composition-based attention in the relational\nspace without additional parameters. The lightweight design makes HoGRN better\nsuitable for sparse settings. For evaluation, we have conducted extensive\nexperiments-the results of HoGRN on several sparse KGs present impressive\nimprovements (9% MRR gain on average). Further ablation and case studies\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the main components. Our codes will be\nreleased upon acceptance.",

    "abstract": "Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is a task that is receiving an\nincreasing amount of research attention in the domain of deep learning for\ncomputer vision. However, the performance of detection methods is generally\nevaluated on the task in isolation, rather than also considering potential\ndownstream tasks in tandem. In this work, we examine selective classification\nin the presence of OOD data (SCOD). That is to say, the motivation for\ndetecting OOD samples is to reject them so their impact on the quality of\npredictions is reduced. We show under this task specification, that existing\npost-hoc methods perform quite differently compared to when evaluated only on\nOOD detection. This is because it is no longer an issue to conflate\nin-distribution (ID) data with OOD data if the ID data is going to be\nmisclassified. However, the conflation within ID data of correct and incorrect\npredictions becomes undesirable. We also propose a novel method for SCOD,\nSoftmax Information Retaining Combination (SIRC), that augments softmax-based\nconfidence scores with feature-agnostic information such that their ability to\nidentify OOD samples is improved without sacrificing separation between correct\nand incorrect ID predictions. Experiments on a wide variety of ImageNet-scale\ndatasets and convolutional neural network architectures show that SIRC is able\nto consistently match or outperform the baseline for SCOD, whilst existing OOD\ndetection methods fail to do so.",

Deep\nEnsembles are a well-established method of improving the quality of uncertainty\nestimates produced by deep neural networks, and have been shown to have\nsuperior OOD detection performance compared to single models. An existing\nintuition in the literature is that the diversity of Deep Ensemble predictions\nindicates distributional shift, and so measures of diversity such as Mutual\nInformation (MI) should be used for OOD detection. We show experimentally that\nthis intuition is not valid on ImageNet-scale OOD detection -- using MI leads\nto 30-40% worse %FPR@95 compared to single-model entropy on some OOD datasets.\nWe suggest an alternative explanation for Deep Ensembles' better OOD detection\nperformance -- OOD detection is binary classification and we are ensembling\ndiverse classifiers.

By\ntraining a neural model of the search strategy on a large set of simulated\nstochastic environments, conditioning it on few real-world examples and\ninverting the model, we can infer search strategies which adapt to the\ntime-variant characteristics of the underlying probability distributions, while\nrequiring very few real-world measurements. We evaluate our approach on two\ndifferent industrial robots in the context of spiral and probe search for THT\nelectronics assembly.",

    "abstract": "The recently increased complexity of Machine Learning (ML) methods, led to\nthe necessity to lighten both the research and industry development processes.\nML pipelines have become an essential tool for experts of many domains, data\nscientists and researchers, allowing them to easily put together several ML\nmodels to cover the full analytic process starting from raw datasets. Over the\nyears, several solutions have been proposed to automate the building of ML\npipelines, most of them focused on semantic aspects and characteristics of the\ninput dataset. However, an approach taking into account the new quality\nconcerns needed by ML systems (like fairness, interpretability, privacy, etc.)\nis still missing. In this paper, we first identify, from the literature, key\nquality attributes of ML systems. Further, we propose a new engineering\napproach for quality ML pipeline by properly extending the Feature Models\nmeta-model. The presented approach allows to model ML pipelines, their quality\nrequirements (on the whole pipeline and on single phases), and quality\ncharacteristics of algorithms used to implement each pipeline phase. Finally,\nwe demonstrate the expressiveness of our model considering the classification\nproblem.",

    "abstract": "3D point cloud models are widely applied in safety-critical scenes, which\ndelivers an urgent need to obtain more solid proofs to verify the robustness of\nmodels. Existing verification method for point cloud model is time-expensive\nand computationally unattainable on large networks. Additionally, they cannot\nhandle the complete PointNet model with joint alignment network (JANet) that\ncontains multiplication layers, which effectively boosts the performance of 3D\nmodels. This motivates us to design a more efficient and general framework to\nverify various architectures of point cloud models. The key challenges in\nverifying the large-scale complete PointNet models are addressed as dealing\nwith the cross-non-linearity operations in the multiplication layers and the\nhigh computational complexity of high-dimensional point cloud inputs and added\nlayers. Thus, we propose an efficient verification framework, 3DVerifier, to\ntackle both challenges by adopting a linear relaxation function to bound the\nmultiplication layer and combining forward and backward propagation to compute\nthe certified bounds of the outputs of the point cloud models. Our\ncomprehensive experiments demonstrate that 3DVerifier outperforms existing\nverification algorithms for 3D models in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.\nNotably, our approach achieves an orders-of-magnitude improvement in\nverification efficiency for the large network, and the obtained certified\nbounds are also significantly tighter than the state-of-the-art verifiers.

    "abstract": "Multiple-view visualization (MV) has been used for visual analytics in\nvarious fields (e.g., bioinformatics, cybersecurity, and intelligence\nanalysis). Because each view encodes data from a particular perspective,\nanalysts often use a set of views laid out in 2D space to link and synthesize\ninformation. The difficulty of this process is impacted by the spatial\norganization of these views. For instance, connecting information from views\nfar from each other can be more challenging than neighboring ones. However,\nmost visual analysis tools currently either fix the positions of the views or\ncompletely delegate this organization of views to users (who must manually drag\nand move views). This either limits user involvement in managing the layout of\nMV or is overly flexible without much guidance. Then, a key design challenge in\nMV layout is determining the factors in a spatial organization that impact\nunderstanding. To address this, we review a set of MV-based systems and\nidentify considerations for MV layout rooted in two key concerns: perception,\nwhich considers how users perceive view relationships, and content, which\nconsiders the relationships in the data. We show how these allow us to study\nand analyze the design of MV layout systematically.",

    "abstract": "Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) is a sample-efficient way of learning\ncomplex behaviors by leveraging a learned single-step dynamics model to plan\nactions in imagination. However, planning every action for long-horizon tasks\nis not practical, akin to a human planning out every muscle movement. Instead,\nhumans efficiently plan with high-level skills to solve complex tasks. From\nthis intuition, we propose a Skill-based Model-based RL framework (SkiMo) that\nenables planning in the skill space using a skill dynamics model, which\ndirectly predicts the skill outcomes, rather than predicting all small details\nin the intermediate states, step by step. For accurate and efficient long-term\nplanning, we jointly learn the skill dynamics model and a skill repertoire from\nprior experience. We then harness the learned skill dynamics model to\naccurately simulate and plan over long horizons in the skill space, which\nenables efficient downstream learning of long-horizon, sparse reward tasks.\nExperimental results in navigation and manipulation domains show that SkiMo\nextends the temporal horizon of model-based approaches and improves the sample\nefficiency for both model-based RL and skill-based RL.

Some have argued\nthat the presence of these cues promotes the spread of misinformation. Here we\ninvestigate the causal effect of social cues on users' engagement with social\nmedia posts. We conducted an experiment with N=628 Americans on a custom-built\nnewsfeed interface where we systematically varied the presence and strength of\nsocial cues.

Furthermore, relative to a control without social cues, the presence\nof social cues increased the sharing of true relative to false news. The\npresence of social cues also makes it more difficult to precisely predict how\npopular any given post would be. Together, our results suggest that -- instead\nof distracting users or causing them to share low-quality news -- social cues\nmay, in certain circumstances, actually boost truth discernment and reduce the\nsharing of misinformation.

Social media platforms try to protect users' personal\ndata, but there still is a real risk of misuse, including elections\nmanipulation. Did you know, that only 13 posts addressing important or\ncontroversial topics for society are enough to predict one's political\naffiliation with a 0.85 F1-score? To examine this phenomenon, we created a\nnovel universal method of semi-automated political leaning discovery. It relies\non a heuristical data annotation procedure, which was evaluated to achieve 0.95\nagreement with human annotators (counted as an accuracy metric). We also\npresent POLiTweets - the first publicly open Polish dataset for political\naffiliation discovery in a multi-party setup, consisting of over 147k tweets\nfrom almost 10k Polish-writing users annotated heuristically and almost 40k\ntweets from 166 users annotated manually as a test set.

    "abstract": "One of the main challenges in autonomous racing is to design algorithms for\nmotion planning at high speed, and across complex racing courses. End-to-end\ntrajectory synthesis has been previously proposed where the trajectory for the\nego vehicle is computed based on camera images from the racecar. This is done\nin a supervised learning setting using behavioral cloning techniques. In this\npaper, we address the limitations of behavioral cloning methods for trajectory\nsynthesis by introducing Differential Bayesian Filtering (DBF), which uses\nprobabilistic B\\'ezier curves as a basis for inferring optimal autonomous\nracing trajectories based on Bayesian inference. We introduce a trajectory\nsampling mechanism and combine it with a filtering process which is able to\npush the car to its physical driving limits. The performance of DBF is\nevaluated on the DeepRacing Formula One simulation environment and compared\nwith several other trajectory synthesis approaches as well as human driving\nperformance. DBF achieves the fastest lap time, and the fastest speed, by\npushing the racecar closer to its limits of control while always remaining\ninside track bounds.",

    "abstract": "Using parallel embedded systems these days is increasing. They are getting\nmore complex due to integrating multiple functionalities in one application or\nrunning numerous ones concurrently. This concerns a wide range of applications,\nincluding streaming applications, commonly used in embedded systems. These\napplications must implement adaptable and reliable algorithms to deliver the\nrequired performance under varying circumstances (e.g., running applications on\nthe platform, input data, platform variety, etc.). Given the complexity of\nstreaming applications, target systems, and adaptivity requirements, designing\nsuch systems with traditional programming models is daunting. This is why\nmodel-based strategies with an appropriate Model of Computation (MoC) have long\nbeen studied for embedded system design. This work provides algorithmic\nadaptivity on top of parallelism for dynamic dataflow to express larger sets of\nvariants. We present a multi-Alternative Process Network (mAPN), a high-level\nabstract representation in which several variants of the same application\ncoexist in the same graph expressing different implementations. We introduce\nmAPN properties and its formalism to describe various local implementation\nalternatives. Furthermore, mAPNs are enriched with metadata to Provide the\nalternatives with quantitative annotations in terms of a specific metric. To\nhelp the user analyze the rich space of variants, we propose a methodology to\nextract feasible variants under user and hardware constraints. At the core of\nthe methodology is an algorithm for computing global metrics of an execution of\ndifferent alternatives from a compact mAPN specification.

    "abstract": "Many existing autonomous driving paradigms involve a multi-stage discrete\npipeline of tasks. To better predict the control signals and enhance user\nsafety, an end-to-end approach that benefits from joint spatial-temporal\nfeature learning is desirable. While there are some pioneering works on\nLiDAR-based input or implicit design, in this paper we formulate the problem in\nan interpretable vision-based setting. In particular, we propose a\nspatial-temporal feature learning scheme towards a set of more representative\nfeatures for perception, prediction and planning tasks simultaneously, which is\ncalled ST-P3. Specifically, an egocentric-aligned accumulation technique is\nproposed to preserve geometry information in 3D space before the bird's eye\nview transformation for perception; a dual pathway modeling is devised to take\npast motion variations into account for future prediction; a temporal-based\nrefinement unit is introduced to compensate for recognizing vision-based\nelements for planning. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to\nsystematically investigate each part of an interpretable end-to-end\nvision-based autonomous driving system. We benchmark our approach against\nprevious state-of-the-arts on both open-loop nuScenes dataset as well as\nclosed-loop CARLA simulation. The results show the effectiveness of our method.\nSource code, model and protocol details are made publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/OpenPerceptionX/ST-P3.",

Based on the\nvarious feature removal approaches, we describe the multiple types of Shapley\nvalue feature attributions and methods to calculate each one.

    "abstract": "Transformers have gained increasing popularity in a wide range of\napplications, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision and\nSpeech Recognition, because of their powerful representational capacity.\nHowever, harnessing this representational capacity effectively requires a large\namount of data, strong regularization, or both, to mitigate overfitting.\nRecently, the power of the Transformer has been unlocked by self-supervised\npretraining strategies based on masked autoencoders which rely on\nreconstructing masked inputs, directly, or contrastively from unmasked content.\nThis pretraining strategy which has been used in BERT models in NLP, Wav2Vec\nmodels in Speech and, recently, in MAE models in Vision, forces the model to\nlearn about relationships between the content in different parts of the input\nusing autoencoding related objectives. In this paper, we propose a novel, but\nsurprisingly simple alternative to content reconstruction~-- that of predicting\nlocations from content, without providing positional information for it. Doing\nso requires the Transformer to understand the positional relationships between\ndifferent parts of the input, from their content alone. This amounts to an\nefficient implementation where the pretext task is a classification problem\namong all possible positions for each input token. We experiment on both Vision\nand Speech benchmarks, where our approach brings improvements over strong\nsupervised training baselines and is comparable to modern\nunsupervised/self-supervised pretraining methods.

A prominent example concerns the {\\em\nperfection} of $G$ that the chromatic number of each induced subgraph $H$ of\n$G$ equals the clique number of $H$. The seminal Strong Perfect Graph Theorem\nconfirms that the perfection of $G$ can be determined by detecting odd holes in\n$G$ and its complement. Chudnovsky et al. show in 2005 an $O(n^9)$ algorithm\nfor recognizing perfect graphs, which can be implemented to run in\n$O(n^{6+\\omega})$ time for the exponent $\\omega<2.373$ of square-matrix\nmultiplication. We show the following improved algorithms.\n1. The tractability of detecting odd holes was open for decades until the\nmajor breakthrough of Chudnovsky et al. in 2020. Their $O(n^9)$ algorithm is\nlater implemented by Lai et al. to run in $O(n^8)$ time, leading to the best\nformerly known algorithm for recognizing perfect graphs. Our first result is an\n$O(n^7)$ algorithm for detecting odd holes, implying an $O(n^7)$ algorithm for\nrecognizing perfect graphs.\n2. Chudnovsky et al. extend in 2021 the $O(n^9)$ algorithms for detecting odd\nholes (2020) and recognizing perfect graphs (2005) into the first polynomial\nalgorithm for obtaining a shortest odd hole, which runs in $O(n^{14})$ time. We\nreduce the time for finding a shortest odd hole to $O(n^{13})$.\n3. Conforti et al. show in 1997 the first polynomial algorithm for detecting\neven holes, running in about $O(n^{40})$ time. It then takes a line of\nintensive efforts in the literature to bring down the complexity to\n$O(n^{31})$, $O(n^{19})$, $O(n^{11})$, and finally $O(n^9)$. On the other hand,\nthe tractability of finding a shortest even hole has been open for 16 years\nuntil the very recent $O(n^{31})$ algorithm of Cheong and Lu in 2022.

    "abstract": "Continuous Hand Gesture Recognition (CHGR) has been extensively studied by\nresearchers in the last few decades. Recently, one model has been presented to\ndeal with the challenge of the boundary detection of isolated gestures in a\ncontinuous gesture video [17]. To enhance the model performance and also\nreplace the handcrafted feature extractor in the presented model in [17], we\npropose a GCN model and combine it with the stacked Bi-LSTM and Attention\nmodules to push the temporal information in the video stream. Considering the\nbreakthroughs of GCN models for skeleton modality, we propose a two-layer GCN\nmodel to empower the 3D hand skeleton features. Finally, the class\nprobabilities of each isolated gesture are fed to the post-processing module,\nborrowed from [17]. Furthermore, we replace the anatomical graph structure with\nsome non-anatomical graph structures. Due to the lack of a large dataset,\nincluding both the continuous gesture sequences and the corresponding isolated\ngestures, three public datasets in Dynamic Hand Gesture Recognition (DHGR),\nRKS-PERSIANSIGN, and ASLVID, are used for evaluation. Experimental results show\nthe superiority of the proposed model in dealing with isolated gesture\nboundaries detection in continuous gesture sequences",

Furthermore, motivated by the requirements for data\nprivacy and the need for embedded and resource-constrained devices of all kinds\nto adapt to local data distributions, we focus on the setting of feed-forward\nsource-free domain adaptation, where adaptation should not require access to\nthe source dataset, and also be back propagation-free. Our solution is to\nmeta-learn a network capable of embedding the mixed-relevance target dataset\nand dynamically adapting inference for target examples using cross-attention.\nThe resulting framework leads to consistent improvement on strong ERM\nbaselines. We also show that our framework sometimes even improves on the upper\nbound of domain-supervised adaptation, where only domain-relevant instances are\nprovided for adaptation.

However, NVM devices\nsuffer from various non-idealities, especially device-to-device variations due\nto fabrication defects and cycle-to-cycle variations due to the stochastic\nbehavior of devices. As such, the DNN weights actually mapped to NVM devices\ncould deviate significantly from the expected values, leading to large\nperformance degradation. To address this issue, most existing works focus on\nmaximizing average performance under device variations. This objective would\nwork well for general-purpose scenarios. But for safety-critical applications,\nthe worst-case performance must also be considered. Unfortunately, this has\nbeen rarely explored in the literature. In this work, we formulate the problem\nof determining the worst-case performance of CiM DNN accelerators under the\nimpact of device variations. We further propose a method to effectively find\nthe specific combination of device variation in the high-dimensional space that\nleads to the worst-case performance. We find that even with very small device\nvariations, the accuracy of a DNN can drop drastically, causing concerns when\ndeploying CiM accelerators in safety-critical applications. Finally, we show\nthat surprisingly none of the existing methods used to enhance average DNN\nperformance in CiM accelerators are very effective when extended to enhance the\nworst-case performance, and further research down the road is needed to address\nthis problem.",

    "title": "Towards Better Dermoscopic Image Feature Representation Learning for  Melanoma Classification",
    "abstract": "Deep learning-based melanoma classification with dermoscopic images has\nrecently shown great potential in automatic early-stage melanoma diagnosis.\nHowever, limited by the significant data imbalance and obvious extraneous\nartifacts, i.e., the hair and ruler markings, discriminative feature extraction\nfrom dermoscopic images is very challenging. In this study, we seek to resolve\nthese problems respectively towards better representation learning for lesion\nfeatures. Specifically, a GAN-based data augmentation (GDA) strategy is adapted\nto generate synthetic melanoma-positive images, in conjunction with the\nproposed implicit hair denoising (IHD) strategy. Wherein the hair-related\nrepresentations are implicitly disentangled via an auxiliary classifier network\nand reversely sent to the melanoma-feature extraction backbone for better\nmelanoma-specific representation learning. Furthermore, to train the IHD\nmodule, the hair noises are additionally labeled on the ISIC2020 dataset,\nmaking it the first large-scale dermoscopic dataset with annotation of\nhair-like artifacts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the\nproposed framework as well as the effectiveness of each component.

    "abstract": "Recent neural network based Direction of Arrival (DoA) estimation algorithms\nhave performed well on unknown number of sound sources scenarios. These\nalgorithms are usually achieved by mapping the multi-channel audio input to the\nsingle output (i.e. overall spatial pseudo-spectrum (SPS) of all sources), that\nis called MISO. However, such MISO algorithms strongly depend on empirical\nthreshold setting and the angle assumption that the angles between the sound\nsources are greater than a fixed angle. To address these limitations, we\npropose a novel multi-channel input and multiple outputs DoA network called\nMIMO-DoAnet. Unlike the general MISO algorithms, MIMO-DoAnet predicts the SPS\ncoding of each sound source with the help of the informative spatial covariance\nmatrix. By doing so, the threshold task of detecting the number of sound\nsources becomes an easier task of detecting whether there is a sound source in\neach output, and the serious interaction between sound sources disappears\nduring inference stage. Experimental results show that MIMO-DoAnet achieves\nrelative 18.6% and absolute 13.3%, relative 34.4% and absolute 20.2% F1 score\nimprovement compared with the MISO baseline system in 3, 4 sources scenes. The\nresults also demonstrate MIMO-DoAnet alleviates the threshold setting problem\nand solves the angle assumption problem effectively.",

    "abstract": "To control boll weevil (Anthonomus grandis L.) pest re-infestation in cotton\nfields, the current practices of volunteer cotton (VC) (Gossypium hirsutum L.)\nplant detection in fields of rotation crops like corn (Zea mays L.) and sorghum\n(Sorghum bicolor L.) involve manual field scouting at the edges of fields. This\nleads to many VC plants growing in the middle of fields remain undetected that\ncontinue to grow side by side along with corn and sorghum. When they reach\npinhead squaring stage (5-6 leaves), they can serve as hosts for the boll\nweevil pests. Therefore, it is required to detect, locate and then precisely\nspot-spray them with chemicals. In this paper, we present the application of\nYOLOv5m on radiometrically and gamma-corrected low resolution (1.2 Megapixel)\nmultispectral imagery for detecting and locating VC plants growing in the\nmiddle of tasseling (VT) growth stage of cornfield.

Along the way we give a conceptual\ntreatment of several concepts in the theory of deterministic and stochastic\ndynamical systems. In particular,\n- ergodic measures appear very naturally as particular cones of deterministic\nmorphisms (in the sense of Markov categories);\n- the invariant $\\sigma$-algebra of a dynamical system can be seen as a\ncolimit in the category of Markov kernels.\nIn line with other uses of category theory, once the necessary structures are\nin place, our proof of the main theorem is much simpler than traditional\napproaches.

    "abstract": "Low-dose computed tomography (CT) denoising algorithms aim to enable reduced\npatient dose in routine CT acquisitions while maintaining high image quality.\nRecently, deep learning~(DL)-based methods were introduced, outperforming\nconventional denoising algorithms on this task due to their high model\ncapacity. However, for the transition of DL-based denoising to clinical\npractice, these data-driven approaches must generalize robustly beyond the seen\ntraining data. We, therefore, propose a hybrid denoising approach consisting of\na set of trainable joint bilateral filters (JBFs) combined with a convolutional\nDL-based denoising network to predict the guidance image. Our proposed\ndenoising pipeline combines the high model capacity enabled by DL-based feature\nextraction with the reliability of the conventional JBF. The pipeline's ability\nto generalize is demonstrated by training on abdomen CT scans without metal\nimplants and testing on abdomen scans with metal implants as well as on head CT\ndata. When embedding two well-established DL-based denoisers (RED-CNN/QAE) in\nour pipeline, the denoising performance is improved by $10\\,\\%$/$82\\,\\%$ (RMSE)\nand $3\\,\\%$/$81\\,\\%$ (PSNR) in regions containing metal and by $6\\,\\%$/$78\\,\\%$\n(RMSE) and $2\\,\\%$/$4\\,\\%$ (PSNR) on head CT data, compared to the respective\nvanilla model.

    "abstract": "Brain tumor segmentation (BTS) in magnetic resonance image (MRI) is crucial\nfor brain tumor diagnosis, cancer management and research purposes. With the\ngreat success of the ten-year BraTS challenges as well as the advances of CNN\nand Transformer algorithms, a lot of outstanding BTS models have been proposed\nto tackle the difficulties of BTS in different technical aspects. However,\nexisting studies hardly consider how to fuse the multi-modality images in a\nreasonable manner. In this paper, we leverage the clinical knowledge of how\nradiologists diagnose brain tumors from multiple MRI modalities and propose a\nclinical knowledge-driven brain tumor segmentation model, called CKD-TransBTS.\nInstead of directly concatenating all the modalities, we re-organize the input\nmodalities by separating them into two groups according to the imaging\nprinciple of MRI. A dual-branch hybrid encoder with the proposed\nmodality-correlated cross-attention block (MCCA) is designed to extract the\nmulti-modality image features. The proposed model inherits the strengths from\nboth Transformer and CNN with the local feature representation ability for\nprecise lesion boundaries and long-range feature extraction for 3D volumetric\nimages. To bridge the gap between Transformer and CNN features, we propose a\nTrans&CNN Feature Calibration block (TCFC) in the decoder. We compare the\nproposed model with five CNN-based models and six transformer-based models on\nthe BraTS 2021 challenge dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the\nproposed model achieves state-of-the-art brain tumor segmentation performance\ncompared with all the competitors.",

Here, we leverage large-scale\nelectronic health record data, collected from Southern US academic clinics, to\nemulate a clinical trial, i.e., 'target trial', and develop a machine learning\nmodel of mortality prediction and ITE estimation for patients diagnosed with\nacute bacterial skin and skin structure infection (ABSSSI) due to\nmethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). ABSSSI-MRSA is a\nchallenging condition with reduced treatment options - vancomycin is the\npreferred choice, but it has non-negligible side effects. First, we use\npropensity score matching to emulate the trial and create a treatment\nrandomized (vancomycin vs. other antibiotics) dataset. Next, we use this data\nto train various machine learning methods (including boosted/LASSO logistic\nregression, support vector machines, and random forest) and choose the best\nmodel in terms of area under the receiver characteristic (AUC) through\nbootstrap validation. Lastly, we use the models to calculate ITE and identify\npossible averted deaths by therapy change.

By calculating the counterfactuals using the\nBLR/LASSO, vancomycin increases the risk of death, but it shows a large\nvariation (odds ratio 1.2, 95% range 0.4-3.8) and the contribution to outcome\nprobability is modest. Instead, the RF exhibits stronger changes in ITE,\nsuggesting more complex treatment heterogeneity.",

In this setting, synchronizing the nodes' updates\nincurs significant communication overhead and computational costs, so much of\nthe recent literature has focused on the analysis and design of asynchronous\noptimization algorithms where agents activate and communicate at arbitrary\ntimes, without requiring a global synchronization enforcer. Nonetheless, in\nmost of the work on the topic, active nodes select a neighbor to contact based\non a fixed probability (e.g., uniformly at random), a choice that ignores the\noptimization landscape at the moment of activation. Instead, in this work we\nintroduce an optimization-aware selection rule that chooses the neighbor with\nthe highest dual cost improvement (a quantity related to a consensus-based\ndualization of the problem at hand). This scheme is related to the coordinate\ndescent (CD) method with a Gauss-Southwell (GS) rule for coordinate updates; in\nour setting however, only a subset of coordinates is accessible at each\niteration (because each node is constrained to communicate only with its direct\nneighbors), so the existing literature on GS methods does not apply. To\novercome this difficulty, we develop a new analytical framework for smooth and\nstrongly convex $f_i$ that covers the class of set-wise CD algorithms -- a\nclass that directly applies to decentralized scenarios, but is not limited to\nthem -- and we show that the proposed set-wise GS rule achieves a speedup by a\nfactor of up to the maximum degree in the network (which is of the order of\n$\\Theta(n)$ in highly connected graphs). The speedup predicted by our\ntheoretical analysis is subsequently validated in numerical experiments with\nsynthetic data.",

Despite\nrecent advances in deep learning (DL) have shown stellar performance on\ncapturing trading opportunities in the stochastic stock market, we observe that\nthe performance of existing DL methods is sensitive to random seeds and network\ninitialization. To design more profitable DL methods, we analyze this\nphenomenon and find two major limitations of existing works. First, there is a\nnoticeable gap between accurate financial predictions and profitable investment\nstrategies. Second, investment decisions are made based on only one individual\npredictor without consideration of model uncertainty, which is inconsistent\nwith the workflow in real-world trading firms. To tackle these two limitations,\nwe first reformulate quantitative investment as a multi-task learning problem.\nLater on, we propose AlphaMix, a novel two-stage mixture-of-experts (MoE)\nframework for quantitative investment to mimic the efficient bottom-up trading\nstrategy design workflow of successful trading firms. In Stage one, multiple\nindependent trading experts are jointly optimized with an individual\nuncertainty-aware loss function. In Stage two, we train neural routers\n(corresponding to the role of a portfolio manager) to dynamically deploy these\nexperts on an as-needed basis. AlphaMix is also a universal framework that is\napplicable to various backbone network architectures with consistent\nperformance gains.
