    "abstract": "This article presents a detailed introduction to density-based topology\noptimisation of fluid flow problems. The goal is to allow new students and\nresearchers to quickly get started in the research area and to skip many of the\ninitial steps, often consuming unnecessarily long time from the scientific\nadvancement of the field. This is achieved by providing a step-by-step guide to\nthe components necessary to understand and implement the theory, as well as\nextending the supplied MATLAB code. The continuous design representation used\nand how it is connected to the Brinkman penalty approach, for simulating an\nimmersed solid in a fluid domain, is illustrated. The different interpretations\nof the Brinkman penalty term and how to chose the penalty parameters are\nexplained. The accuracy of the Brinkman penalty approach is analysed through\nparametric simulations of a reference geometry. The chosen finite element\nformulation and the solution method is explained. The minimum dissipated energy\noptimisation problem is defined and how to solve it using an optimality\ncriteria solver and a continuation scheme is discussed. The included MATLAB\nimplementation is documented, with details on the mesh, pre-processing,\noptimisation and post-processing. The code has two benchmark examples\nimplemented and the application of the code to these is reviewed. Subsequently,\nseveral modifications to the code for more complicated examples are presented\nthrough provided code modifications and explanations. Lastly, the computational\nperformance of the code is examined through studies of the computational time\nand memory usage, along with recommendations to decrease computational time\nthrough approximations.",

    "abstract": "Trade executions for major stocks come in bursts of activity, which can be\npartly attributed to the presence of self- and mutual excitations endogenous to\nthe system. In this paper, we study transaction reports for five FTSE 100\nstocks. We model the dynamic of transactions between counterparties using both\nunivariate and multivariate Hawkes processes, which we fit to the data using a\nparametric approach. We find that the frequency of transactions between\ncounterparties increases the likelihood of them to transact in the future, and\nthat univariate and multivariate Hawkes processes show promise as generative\nmodels able to reproduce the bursty, hub dominated systems that we observe in\nthe real world. We further show that Hawkes processes perform well when used to\nmodel buys and sells through a central clearing counterparty when considered as\na bivariate process, but not when these are modelled as individual univariate\nprocesses, indicating that mutual excitation between buys and sells is present\nin these markets.",

    "abstract": "Transportation contributes a substantial fraction of all greenhouse gas\nemissions. One approach for reducing such emissions is to modify vehicles'\nroute choices to minimize their fuel consumption or emission, which is known as\neco-routing. Most eco-routing is based on vehicles choosing routes that\nminimize their individual fuel consumption or emissions. The Braess paradox\ndemonstrates that when vehicles choose routes to minimize their individual\ngoals, the aggregate effect may paradoxically result in the opposite net effect\ndue to changes in congestion patterns. We construct a multiclass user\nequilibrium model in which some vehicles use eco-routing and others seek to\nminimize their individual travel times. Using this model, we show that the\nBraess paradox exists for eco-routing. If a large number of vehicles are trying\nto minimize their fuel consumption or emissions, the total fuel consumption or\nemissions may increase. We then solve the multiclass user equilibrium on\npublicly available city network data, and find that eco-routing results in\nincreases in fuel consumption and emissions on some city networks as well.",

    "abstract": "Deriving a good variable selection strategy in branch-and-bound is essential\nfor the efficiency of modern mixed-integer programming (MIP) solvers. With MIP\nbranching data collected during the previous solution process, learning to\nbranch methods have recently become superior over heuristics. As\nbranch-and-bound is naturally a sequential decision making task, one should\nlearn to optimize the utility of the whole MIP solving process instead of being\nmyopic on each step. In this work, we formulate learning to branch as an\noffline reinforcement learning (RL) problem, and propose a long-sighted hybrid\nsearch scheme to construct the offline MIP dataset, which values the long-term\nutilities of branching decisions. During the policy training phase, we deploy a\nranking-based reward assignment scheme to distinguish the promising samples\nfrom the long-term or short-term view, and train the branching model named\nBranch Ranking via offline policy learning. Experiments on synthetic MIP\nbenchmarks and real-world tasks demonstrate that Branch Rankink is more\nefficient and robust, and can better generalize to large scales of MIP\ninstances compared to the widely used heuristics and state-of-the-art\nlearning-based branching models.",

This paper proposes SoundChoice, a\nnovel G2P architecture that processes entire sentences rather than operating at\nthe word level.

Moreover, the\nmodel inherits the best practices in speech recognition, including multi-task\nlearning with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) and beam search with\nan embedded language model. As a result, SoundChoice achieves a Phoneme Error\nRate (PER) of 2.65% on whole-sentence transcription using data from LibriSpeech\nand Wikipedia.

    "abstract": "Memristors, emerging non-volatile memory devices, have shown promising\npotential in neuromorphic hardware designs, especially in spiking neural\nnetwork (SNN) hardware implementation. Memristor-based SNNs have been\nsuccessfully applied in a wide range of various applications, including image\nclassification and pattern recognition. However, implementing memristor-based\nSNNs in text classification is still under exploration. One of the main reasons\nis that training memristor-based SNNs for text classification is costly due to\nthe lack of efficient learning rules and memristor non-idealities. To address\nthese issues and accelerate the research of exploring memristor-based spiking\nneural networks in text classification applications, we develop a simulation\nframework with a virtual memristor array using an empirical memristor model. We\nuse this framework to demonstrate a sentiment analysis task in the IMDB movie\nreviews dataset. We take two approaches to obtain trained spiking neural\nnetworks with memristor models: 1) by converting a pre-trained artificial\nneural network (ANN) to a memristor-based SNN, or 2) by training a\nmemristor-based SNN directly. These two approaches can be applied in two\nscenarios: offline classification and online training. We achieve the\nclassification accuracy of 85.88% by converting a pre-trained ANN to a\nmemristor-based SNN and 84.86% by training the memristor-based SNN directly,\ngiven that the baseline training accuracy of the equivalent ANN is 86.02%. We\nconclude that it is possible to achieve similar classification accuracy in\nsimulation from ANNs to SNNs and from non-memristive synapses to data-driven\nmemristive synapses.

The wave equation can\nbe written as a first order hyperbolic system. Considering each characteristic\nfamily, a straightforward application of ELDG will be to transform to the\ncharacteristic variables, evolve them on associated characteristic related\nspace-time regions, and transform them back to the original variables. However,\nthe mass conservation could not be guaranteed in a general setting. In this\npaper, we formulate a mass conservative semi-discrete ELDG method by\ndecomposing each variable into two parts, each of them associated with a\ndifferent characteristic family. As a result, four different quantities are\nevolved in EL fashion and recombined to update the solution. The fully discrete\nscheme is formulated by using method-of-lines RK methods, with intermediate RK\nsolutions updated on the background mesh. Numerical results on 1D and 2D wave\nequations are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed ELDG\nmethod.

    "abstract": "In this paper, a Quadrature by Two Expansions (QB2X) numerical integration\ntechnique is developed for the single and double layer potentials of the\nHelmholtz equation in two dimensions. The QB2X method uses both local complex\nTaylor expansions and plane wave type expansions to achieve a resulting\nrepresentation which is numerically accurate for all target points (interior,\nexterior, or exactly on the boundary) inside a leaf box in the fast multipole\nmethod (FMM) hierarchical tree structure. Compared to the original Quadrature\nby Expansion (QBX) method, the QB2X method explicitly includes the nonlinearity\nfrom the boundary geometry in the plane wave expansions, thereby providing for\nhigher order representations of both the boundary geometry and density\nfunctions in the integrand, with its convergence following standard FMM error\nanalysis. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the\nQB2X method for Helmholtz layer potentials and its comparison with the original\nQBX method for both flat and curved boundaries with various densities. The QB2X\nmethod overcomes the challenges of the original QBX method, and is better\nsuited for efficient solutions of the Helmholtz equation with complex\ngeometries.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), inspired by Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNNs), aggregate the message of nodes' neighbors and structure information to\nacquire expressive representations of nodes for node classification, graph\nclassification, and link prediction. Previous studies have indicated that GNNs\nare vulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), which infer whether a\nnode is in the training data of GNNs and leak the node's private information,\nlike the patient's disease history. The implementation of previous MIAs takes\nadvantage of the models' probability output, which is infeasible if GNNs only\nprovide the prediction label (label-only) for the input.\nIn this paper, we propose a label-only MIA against GNNs for node\nclassification with the help of GNNs' flexible prediction mechanism, e.g.,\nobtaining the prediction label of one node even when neighbors' information is\nunavailable. Our attacking method achieves around 60\\% accuracy, precision, and\nArea Under the Curve (AUC) for most datasets and GNN models, some of which are\ncompetitive or even better than state-of-the-art probability-based MIAs\nimplemented under our environment and settings. Additionally, we analyze the\ninfluence of the sampling method, model selection approach, and overfitting\nlevel on the attack performance of our label-only MIA. Both of those factors\nhave an impact on the attack performance. Then, we consider scenarios where\nassumptions about the adversary's additional dataset (shadow dataset) and extra\ninformation about the target model are relaxed. Even in those scenarios, our\nlabel-only MIA achieves a better attack performance in most cases. Finally, we\nexplore the effectiveness of possible defenses, including Dropout,\nRegularization, Normalization, and Jumping knowledge. None of those four\ndefenses prevent our attack completely.",

While practitioners often use count-based metrics\nderived from confusion matrices, like accuracy, many applications, such as\nweather prediction, sports betting, or patient risk prediction, rely on a\nclassifier's predicted probabilities rather than predicted labels. In these\ninstances, practitioners are concerned with producing a calibrated model, that\nis, one which outputs probabilities that reflect those of the true\ndistribution. Model calibration is often analyzed visually, through static\nreliability diagrams, however, the traditional calibration visualization may\nsuffer from a variety of drawbacks due to the strong aggregations it\nnecessitates. Furthermore, count-based approaches are unable to sufficiently\nanalyze model calibration. We present Calibrate, an interactive reliability\ndiagram that addresses the aforementioned issues. Calibrate constructs a\nreliability diagram that is resistant to drawbacks in traditional approaches,\nand allows for interactive subgroup analysis and instance-level inspection.

For a long time, researchers focused on\nextracting topics from the text and visualizing them based on their relative\nsignificance in the corpus. However, recently, researchers started coming up\nwith more complex systems that not only expose the topics of the corpus but\nalso word closely related to the topic to give users a holistic view. These\ndetailed visualizations spawned research on comparing text corpora based on\ntheir visualization. Topics are often compared to idealize the difference\nbetween corpora. However, to capture greater semantics from different corpora,\nresearchers have started to compare texts based on the sentiment of the topics\nrelated to the text. Comparing the words carrying the most weightage, we can\nget an idea about the important topics for corpus. There are multiple existing\ntexts comparing methods present that compare topics rather than sentiments but\nwe feel that focusing on sentiment-carrying words would better compare the two\ncorpora. Since only sentiments can explain the real feeling of the text and not\njust the topic, topics without sentiments are just nouns. We aim to\ndifferentiate the corpus with a focus on sentiment, as opposed to comparing all\nthe words appearing in the two corpora. The rationale behind this is, that the\ntwo corpora do not many have identical words for side-by-side comparison, so\ncomparing the sentiment words gives us an idea of how the corpora are appealing\nto the emotions of the reader. We can argue that the entropy or the\nunexpectedness and divergence of topics should also be of importance and help\nus to identify key pivot points and the importance of certain topics in the\ncorpus alongside relative sentiment.",

While this is adequate to support user\ninput, it unfortunately limits users' virtual representations to just their\nupper bodies. Current systems thus resort to floating avatars, whose limitation\nis particularly evident in collaborative settings. To estimate full-body poses\nfrom the sparse input sources, prior work has incorporated additional trackers\nand sensors at the pelvis or lower body, which increases setup complexity and\nlimits practical application in mobile settings. In this paper, we present\nAvatarPoser, the first learning-based method that predicts full-body poses in\nworld coordinates using only motion input from the user's head and hands. Our\nmethod builds on a Transformer encoder to extract deep features from the input\nsignals and decouples global motion from the learned local joint orientations\nto guide pose estimation. To obtain accurate full-body motions that resemble\nmotion capture animations, we refine the arm joints' positions using an\noptimization routine with inverse kinematics to match the original tracking\ninput. In our evaluation, AvatarPoser achieved new state-of-the-art results in\nevaluations on large motion capture datasets (AMASS).

We hypothesize two key\nchallenges here: first, it is difficult to replicate such scenarios in the real\nworld, which is necessary for training and testing purposes. Second, current\nsystems are not fully able to take advantage of the rich multi-modal data\navailable in such hazardous environments. To address the first challenge, we\npropose to harness the enormous amount of visual content available in the form\nof movies and TV shows, and develop a dataset that can represent hazardous\nenvironments encountered in the real world. The data is annotated with\nhigh-level danger ratings for realistic disaster images, and corresponding\nkeywords are provided that summarize the content of the scene. In response to\nthe second challenge, we propose a multi-modal danger estimation pipeline for\ncollaborative human-robot escape scenarios. Our Bayesian framework improves\ndanger estimation by fusing information from robot's camera sensor and language\ninputs from the human. Furthermore, we augment the estimation module with a\nrisk-aware planner that helps in identifying safer paths out of the dangerous\nenvironment.

First, due to coarse-grained data transfers\n(size of a cache block, usually 64B between the DRAM and the memory controller,\nsystems waste energy on transferring data that is not used. Second, due to\ncoarse-grained DRAM row activation, systems waste energy by activating DRAM\ncells that are unused in many workloads where spatial locality is lower than\nthe large row size (usually 8-16KB).\nWe propose Sectored DRAM, a new, low-overhead DRAM substrate that alleviates\nthe two inefficiencies, by enabling fine-grained DRAM access and activation. To\nefficiently retrieve only the useful data from DRAM, Sectored DRAM exploits the\nobservation that many cache blocks are not fully utilized in many workloads due\nto poor spatial locality. Sectored DRAM predicts the words in a cache block\nthat will likely be accessed during the cache block's cache residency and: (i)\ntransfers only the predicted words on the memory channel, as opposed to\ntransferring the entire cache block, by dynamically tailoring the DRAM data\ntransfer size for the workload and (ii) activates a smaller set of cells that\ncontain the predicted words, as opposed to activating the entire DRAM row, by\ncarefully operating physically isolated portions of DRAM rows (MATs).\nCompared to prior work in fine-grained DRAM, Sectored DRAM greatly reduces\nDRAM energy consumption, does not reduce DRAM throughput, and can be\nimplemented with low hardware cost. We evaluate Sectored DRAM using 41\nworkloads from widely-used benchmark suites. Sectored DRAM reduces the DRAM\nenergy consumption of highly-memory-intensive workloads by up to (on average)\n33% (20%) while improving their performance by 17% on average.

In this paper, a fault detection and\nisolation method, based on the flatness property of nonlinear systems, is\nexperimentally applied on the three-tank system, which is considered as a\npopular prototype of hydraulic systems. Specifically, fault indicators, called\nresidues, are generated using flat output measurements, and for the purpose of\nfault isolation, a definition of the isolability is introduced. This definition\nallows the characterization of flat outputs that are useful for fault\nisolation. A sensitivity analysis is proposed in order to improve the\nrobustness of the method.

    "abstract": "We present Pose-NDF, a continuous model for plausible human poses based on\nneural distance fields (NDFs). Pose or motion priors are important for\ngenerating realistic new poses and for reconstructing accurate poses from noisy\nor partial observations. Pose-NDF learns a manifold of plausible poses as the\nzero level set of a neural implicit function, extending the idea of modeling\nimplicit surfaces in 3D to the high-dimensional domain SO(3)^K, where a human\npose is defined by a single data point, represented by K quaternions. The\nresulting high-dimensional implicit function can be differentiated with respect\nto the input poses and thus can be used to project arbitrary poses onto the\nmanifold by using gradient descent on the set of 3-dimensional hyperspheres. In\ncontrast to previous VAE-based human pose priors, which transform the pose\nspace into a Gaussian distribution, we model the actual pose manifold,\npreserving the distances between poses. We demonstrate that PoseNDF outperforms\nexisting state-of-the-art methods as a prior in various downstream tasks,\nranging from denoising real-world human mocap data, pose recovery from occluded\ndata to 3D pose reconstruction from images. Furthermore, we show that it can be\nused to generate more diverse poses by random sampling and projection than\nVAE-based methods.",

In addition, we impose the prior\nknowledge of human body's morphological relationship via attention masking and\nmesh upsampling operations, which leads to faster convergence with higher\naccuracy.

Method: We conducted a\nmultiple case study with 5 cases (5 courses from 3 universities) and two units\nof analysis (student and instructor).

However, several factors\nnegatively influence their understanding of modelling, e.g., assignments with\nunclear expectations, irregular and insufficient feedback on their models, and\nlack of experience with the problem domains. Conclusions: Our findings help in\nunderstanding better why students struggle with software modelling, and might\nbe reluctant to adopt it later on.

Methods: A two-degree-of-freedom control configuration, formed by a\nfeedback controller and a feedforward controller, is explored. The feedback\ncontroller is a proportional-integral controller and the feedforward controller\nis designed using the inverse of a control-oriented model of muscle tissue. A\ngeneralized linear model and a nonlinear model of muscle tissue are explored\nusing input-output data and system identification techniques. The force control\nscheme is tested on equine airway smooth muscle and its robustness confirmed\nwith murine flexor digitorum brevis muscle. Results: Performance and\nrepeatability of the force control scheme as well as the number of inputs and\nlevel of supervision required from the user were assessed with a series of\nexperiments. The force control scheme was able to fulfill the stated control\nobjectives in most cases, including the requirements for settling time and\novershoot. Conclusion: The proposed control scheme is shown to enable\nautomation of force control for characterizing muscle mechanics with minimal\nuser input required.

Information retrieval in the form\nof reconstructing auditory stimuli has also shown some success, but here we\nimprove on previous methods by reconstructing music stimuli well enough to be\nperceived and identified independently. Furthermore, deep learning models were\ntrained on time-aligned music stimuli spectrum for each corresponding\none-second window of EEG recording, which greatly reduces feature extraction\nsteps needed when compared to prior studies. The NMED-Tempo and NMED-Hindi\ndatasets of participants passively listening to full length songs were used to\ntrain and validate Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) regressors. The efficacy\nof raw voltage versus power spectrum inputs and linear versus mel spectrogram\noutputs were tested, and all inputs and outputs were converted into 2D images.\nThe quality of reconstructed spectrograms was assessed by training classifiers\nwhich showed 81% accuracy for mel-spectrograms and 72% for linear spectrograms\n(10% chance accuracy). Lastly, reconstructions of auditory music stimuli were\ndiscriminated by listeners at an 85% success rate (50% chance) in a\ntwo-alternative match-to-sample task.",

    "title": "Predicting the Output Structure of Sparse Matrix Multiplication with  Sampled Compression Ratio",
    "abstract": "Sparse general matrix multiplication (SpGEMM) is a fundamental building block\nin numerous scientific applications. One critical task of SpGEMM is to compute\nor predict the structure of the output matrix (i.e., the number of nonzero\nelements per output row) for efficient memory allocation and load balance,\nwhich impact the overall performance of SpGEMM. Existing work either precisely\ncalculates the output structure or adopts upper-bound or sampling-based methods\nto predict the output structure. However, these methods either take much\nexecution time or are not accurate enough. In this paper, we propose a novel\nsampling-based method with better accuracy and low costs compared to the\nexisting sampling-based method. The proposed method first predicts the\ncompression ratio of SpGEMM by leveraging the number of intermediate products\n(denoted as FLOP) and the number of nonzero elements (denoted as NNZ) of the\nsame sampled result matrix. And then, the predicted output structure is\nobtained by dividing the FLOP per output row by the predicted compression\nratio. We also propose a reference design of the existing sampling-based method\nwith optimized computing overheads to demonstrate the better accuracy of the\nproposed method. We construct 625 test cases with various matrix dimensions and\nsparse structures to evaluate the prediction accuracy. Experimental results\nshow that the absolute relative errors of the proposed method and the reference\ndesign are 1.56\\% and 8.12\\%, respectively, on average, and 25\\% and 156\\%,\nrespectively, in the worst case.",

    "abstract": "While deep neural networks are capable of achieving state-of-the-art\nperformance in various domains, their training typically requires iterating for\nmany passes over the dataset. However, due to computational and memory\nconstraints and potential privacy concerns, storing and accessing all the data\nis impractical in many real-world scenarios where the data arrives in a stream.\nIn this paper, we investigate the problem of one-pass learning, in which a\nmodel is trained on sequentially arriving data without retraining on previous\ndatapoints. Motivated by the increasing use of overparameterized models, we\ndevelop Orthogonal Recursive Fitting (ORFit), an algorithm for one-pass\nlearning which seeks to perfectly fit every new datapoint while changing the\nparameters in a direction that causes the least change to the predictions on\nprevious datapoints. By doing so, we bridge two seemingly distinct algorithms\nin adaptive filtering and machine learning, namely the recursive least-squares\n(RLS) algorithm and orthogonal gradient descent (OGD). Our algorithm uses the\nmemory efficiently by exploiting the structure of the streaming data via an\nincremental principal component analysis (IPCA). Further, we show that, for\noverparameterized linear models, the parameter vector obtained by our algorithm\nis what stochastic gradient descent (SGD) would converge to in the standard\nmulti-pass setting. Finally, we generalize the results to the nonlinear setting\nfor highly overparameterized models, relevant for deep learning.

Existing pseudo-labeling methods commonly assume that the class\ndistributions of training data are balanced. However, such an assumption is far\nfrom realistic scenarios and existing pseudo-labeling methods suffer from\nsevere performance degeneration in the context of class-imbalance. In this\nwork, we investigate pseudo-labeling under imbalanced semi-supervised setups.\nThe core idea is to automatically assimilate the training bias arising from\nclass-imbalance, using a bias adaptive classifier that equips the original\nlinear classifier with a bias attractor. The bias attractor is designed to be a\nlight-weight residual network for adapting to the training bias. Specifically,\nthe bias attractor is learned through a bi-level learning framework such that\nthe bias adaptive classifier is able to fit imbalanced training data, while the\nlinear classifier can give unbiased label prediction for each class.

    "abstract": "Current AI systems are designed to solve close-world problems with the\nassumption that the underlying world is remaining more or less the same.\nHowever, when dealing with real-world problems such assumptions can be invalid\nas sudden and unexpected changes can occur. To effectively deploy AI-powered\nsystems in the real world, AI systems should be able to deal with open-world\nnovelty quickly. Inevitably, dealing with open-world novelty raises an\nimportant question of novelty difficulty. Knowing whether one novelty is harder\nto deal with than another, can help researchers to train their systems\nsystematically. In addition, it can also serve as a measurement of the\nperformance of novelty robust AI systems. In this paper, we propose to define\nthe novelty reaction difficulty as a relative difficulty of performing the\nknown task after the introduction of the novelty.

Recently, Vision\nTransformer (ViT) exhibits a strong ability to capture long-range dependencies\nand many researchers attempt to apply ViT to image denoising tasks. However,\nreal-world image is an isolated frame that makes the ViT build the long-range\ndependencies on the internal patches, which divides images into patches and\ndisarranges the noise pattern and gradient continuity. In this article, we\npropose to resolve this issue by using a continuous Wavelet Sliding-Transformer\nthat builds frequency correspondence under real-world scenes, called DnSwin.\nSpecifically, we first extract the bottom features from noisy input images by\nusing a CNN encoder. The key to DnSwin is to separate high-frequency and\nlow-frequency information from the features and build frequency dependencies.\nTo this end, we propose Wavelet Sliding-Window Transformer that utilizes\ndiscrete wavelet transform, self-attention and inverse discrete wavelet\ntransform to extract deep features. Finally, we reconstruct the deep features\ninto denoised images using a CNN decoder.

To\nensure the quality of target sensing while preventing their potential\neavesdropping, the BS combines the transmit confidential information signals\nwith additional dedicated sensing signals, which play a dual role of artificial\nnoise (AN) for degrading the qualities of eavesdropping channels. Under this\nsetup, we jointly design the transmit information and sensing beamforming, with\nthe objective of minimizing the weighted sum of beampattern matching errors and\ncross-correlation patterns for sensing subject to secure communication\nconstraints. The robust design takes into account the channel state information\n(CSI) imperfectness of the eavesdroppers in two practical CSI error scenarios.\nFirst, we consider the scenario with bounded CSI errors of eavesdroppers, in\nwhich the worst-case secrecy rate constraint is adopted to ensure secure\ncommunication performance.

    "abstract": "Land cover classification is a multi-class segmentation task to classify each\npixel into a certain natural or man-made category of the earth surface, such as\nwater, soil, natural vegetation, crops, and human infrastructure. Limited by\nhardware computational resources and memory capacity, most existing studies\npreprocessed original remote sensing images by down sampling or cropping them\ninto small patches less than 512*512 pixels before sending them to a deep\nneural network. However, down sampling images incurs spatial detail loss,\nrenders small segments hard to discriminate, and reverses the spatial\nresolution progress obtained by decades of years of efforts. Cropping images\ninto small patches causes a loss of long-range context information, and\nrestoring the predicted results to their original size brings extra latency. In\nresponse to the above weaknesses, we present an efficient lightweight semantic\nsegmentation network termed MKANet. Aimed at the characteristics of top view\nhigh-resolution remote sensing imagery, MKANet utilizes sharing kernels to\nsimultaneously and equally handle ground segments of inconsistent scales, and\nalso employs parallel and shallow architecture to boost inference speed and\nfriendly support image patches more than 10X larger. To enhance boundary and\nsmall segments discrimination, we also propose a method that captures category\nimpurity areas, exploits boundary information and exerts an extra penalty on\nboundaries and small segment misjudgment. Both visual interpretations and\nquantitative metrics of extensive experiments demonstrate that MKANet acquires\nstate-of-the-art accuracy on two land-cover classification datasets and infers\n2X faster than other competitive lightweight networks.

In this paper, we propose an\nadvanced generative steganography network (GSN) that can generate realistic\nstego images without using cover images, in which mutual information is firstly\nintroduced in stego image generation. Our model contains four sub-networks,\ni.e., an image generator ($G$), a discriminator ($D$), a steganalyzer ($S$),\nand a data extractor ($E$). $D$ and $S$ act as two adversarial discriminators\nto ensure the visual and statistical imperceptibility of generated stego\nimages. $E$ is to extract the hidden secret from generated stego images. The\ngenerator $G$ is flexibly constructed to synthesize either cover or stego\nimages with different inputs. It facilitates covert communication by hiding the\nfunction of generating stego images in a normal image generator. A module named\nsecret block is designed delicately to conceal secret data in the feature maps\nduring image generation, with which high hiding capacity and image fidelity are\nachieved.

    "abstract": "Computational security in cryptography has a risk that computational\nassumptions underlying the security are broken in the future. One solution is\nto construct information-theoretically-secure protocols, but many cryptographic\nprimitives are known to be impossible (or unlikely) to have\ninformation-theoretical security even in the quantum world. A nice compromise\n(intrinsic to quantum) is certified everlasting security, which roughly means\nthe following. A receiver with possession of quantum encrypted data can issue a\ncertificate that shows that the receiver has deleted the encrypted data. If the\ncertificate is valid, the security is guaranteed even if the receiver becomes\ncomputationally unbounded. Although several cryptographic primitives, such as\ncommitments and zero-knowledge, have been made certified everlasting secure,\nthere are many other important primitives that are not known to be certified\neverlasting secure.\nIn this paper, we introduce certified everlasting FE. In this primitive, the\nreceiver with the ciphertext of a message m and the functional decryption key\nof a function f can obtain f(m) and nothing else. The security holds even if\nthe adversary becomes computationally unbounded after issuing a valid\ncertificate. We, first, construct certified everlasting FE for P/poly circuits\nwhere only a single key query is allowed for the adversary. We, then, extend it\nto q-bounded one for NC1 circuits where q-bounded means that q key queries are\nallowed for the adversary with an a priori bounded polynomial q. For the\nconstruction of certified everlasting FE, we introduce and construct certified\neverlasting versions of secret-key encryption, public-key encryption, receiver\nnon-committing encryption, and a garbling scheme, which are of independent\ninterest.",

We consider the problem of embedding a hypergraph\ninto low-dimensional Euclidean space so that most interactions are short-range.\nThis embedding is relevant to many follow-on tasks, such as node reordering,\nclustering, and visualization. We focus on two spectral embedding algorithms\ncustomized to hypergraphs which recover linear and periodic structures\nrespectively. In the periodic case, nodes are positioned on the unit circle.

They allow us to quantify the relative presence of periodic and\nlinear structures in the data through maximum likelihood.

    "abstract": "Owing to its nature of scalability and privacy by design, federated learning\n(FL) has received increasing interest in decentralized deep learning. FL has\nalso facilitated recent research on upscaling and privatizing personalized\nrecommendation services, using on-device data to learn recommender models\nlocally. These models are then aggregated globally to obtain a more performant\nmodel, while maintaining data privacy. Typically, federated recommender systems\n(FRSs) do not consider the lack of resources and data availability at the\nend-devices. In addition, they assume that the interaction data between users\nand items is i.i.d. and stationary across end-devices, and that all local\nrecommender models can be directly averaged without considering the user's\nbehavioral diversity. However, in real scenarios, recommendations have to be\nmade on end-devices with sparse interaction data and limited resources.\nFurthermore, users' preferences are heterogeneous and they frequently visit new\nitems. This makes their personal preferences highly skewed, and the\nstraightforwardly aggregated model is thus ill-posed for such non-i.i.d. data.\nIn this paper, we propose Resource Efficient Federated Recommender System\n(ReFRS) to enable decentralized recommendation with dynamic and diversified\nuser preferences. On the device side, ReFRS consists of a lightweight\nself-supervised local model built upon the variational autoencoder for learning\na user's temporal preference from a sequence of interacted items. On the server\nside, ReFRS utilizes a semantic sampler to adaptively perform model aggregation\nwithin each identified user cluster. The clustering module operates in an\nasynchronous and dynamic manner to support efficient global model update and\ncope with shifting user interests. As a result, ReFRS achieves superior\nperformance in terms of both accuracy and scalability, as demonstrated by\ncomparative experiments.",

Although several studies\nrelated to music recommendation systems exploiting negative preferences have\nshown performance improvements, there was a lack of explanation on how they led\nto better recommendations. In this work, we analyze the role of negative\npreference in users' music tastes by comparing music recommendation models with\ncontrastive learning exploiting preference (CLEP) but with three different\ntraining strategies - exploiting preferences of both positive and negative\n(CLEP-PN), positive only (CLEP-P), and negative only (CLEP-N). We evaluate the\neffectiveness of the negative preference by validating each system with a small\namount of personalized data obtained via survey and further illuminate the\npossibility of exploiting negative preference in music recommendations. Our\nexperimental results show that CLEP-N outperforms the other two in accuracy and\nfalse positive rate.

    "abstract": "Modern deep neural network models are known to erroneously classify\nout-of-distribution (OOD) test data into one of the in-distribution (ID)\ntraining classes with high confidence. This can have disastrous consequences\nfor safety-critical applications. A popular mitigation strategy is to train a\nseparate classifier that can detect such OOD samples at the test time. In most\npractical settings OOD examples are not known at the train time, and hence a\nkey question is: how to augment the ID data with synthetic OOD samples for\ntraining such an OOD detector? In this paper, we propose a novel Compounded\nCorruption technique for the OOD data augmentation termed CnC. One of the major\nadvantages of CnC is that it does not require any hold-out data apart from the\ntraining set. Further, unlike current state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques, CnC\ndoes not require backpropagation or ensembling at the test time, making our\nmethod much faster at inference. Our extensive comparison with 20 methods from\nthe major conferences in last 4 years show that a model trained using CnC based\ndata augmentation, significantly outperforms SOTA, both in terms of OOD\ndetection accuracy as well as inference time. We include a detailed post-hoc\nanalysis to investigate the reasons for the success of our method and identify\nhigher relative entropy and diversity of CnC samples as probable causes. We\nalso provide theoretical insights via a piece-wise decomposition analysis on a\ntwo-dimensional dataset to reveal (visually and quantitatively) that our\napproach leads to a tighter boundary around ID classes, leading to better\ndetection of OOD samples.

    "title": "Very large-scale neighborhood search for drone routing with energy  replenishment",
    "abstract": "The Drone Routing Problem with Energy replenishment (DRP-E) belongs to a\ngeneral class of routing problems with intermediate stops and synchronization\nconstraints. In DRP-E, the drone has to visit a set of nodes and routinely\nrequires battery swaps from a (potentially) mobile replenishment station.\nContrary to widespread restrictions in the drone routing literature, several\ndestinations may be visited in between two consecutive battery swaps. In this\npaper, we propose a nontrivial very large-scale neighbourhood for DRP-E, which\nsynergetically leverages two large-sized polynomially solvable DRP-E\nSubProblems (SP1 and SP2). The number of feasible solutions in the resulting\nneighborhood is a multiple of those in SP1 and SP2, and, thus, exponential in\nthe input size of the problem, whereas the computational time to search it\nremains polynomial. The proposed polynomial two-stage dynamic programming\nalgorithm VLSN to search this neighborhood can be flexibly adjusted to the\ndesired trade-off between accuracy and computational time. For instance, the\nsearch procedure can be converted into an exact algorithm of competitive\nruntime for DRP-E. In computational tests, the developed solution methods\noutperform current state-of-the art heuristics for DRP-E by a significant\nmargin. A case study based on a search for missing persons demonstrates that\nVLSN easily accommodates additional practice relevant features and outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art solution in disaster relief by 20%.",

The total area distortion energy can\nbe rewritten into the sum of Dirichlet energies associated with the southern\nand northern hemispheres, respectively, and can be decreased by alternatingly\nsolving the corresponding Laplacian equations.

Despite its simple statement, this problem is of fundamental\ninterest to both theoretical computer science and statistical mechanics.

However, existing works usually focus only on\na certain capability with some downstream tasks. There is a lack of datasets\nfor directly evaluating the masked word prediction performance and the\ninterpretability of pre-trained LMs. To fill in the gap, we propose a novel\nevaluation benchmark providing with both English and Chinese annotated data.

We conduct experiments on several widely-used\npre-trained LMs. The results show that they perform very poorly on the\ndimensions of knowledge and computation. And their plausibility in all\ndimensions is far from satisfactory, especially when the rationale is short. In\naddition, the pre-trained LMs we evaluated are not robust on syntax-aware data.\nWe will release this evaluation benchmark at \\url{this http URL}, and hope it can\nfacilitate the research progress of pre-trained LMs.",

    "abstract": "In a Systems Engineering setting, various models are produced using a variety\nof methods and tools. Focusing on a type of models -- called descriptive models\n-- which we shall describe, we argue that, while the clarity and precision of\nmodels are essential for their exchange and reuse, the way in which the data of\nthese models are defined and the information conveyed is also essential for\ntheir (re) utilization -- e.g., for analysis or synthesis purposes. Category\nTheory has made it possible to link seemingly separate fields or domains, so\nthat anything that can be rewritten in this framework benefits from a level of\nabstraction and a relational viewpoint -- essential to address complexity. We\ntherefore take advantage of this framework to define a federated architecture\nfor projecting and conveying these models without sacrificing clarity and\nprecision. A federated architecture has two important advantages. On the one\nhand, it unifies these models from their structure; on the other hand, it\nallows a specific usage (instantiation or interpretation) of this structure\nwithin a business domain. We define the structure of these models as a\nsymmetric multicategory. In particular, we rely on matrices over a semiring to\ndefine morphisms and their composition.

    "title": "Neural Architecture Search on Efficient Transformers and Beyond",
    "abstract": "Recently, numerous efficient Transformers have been proposed to reduce the\nquadratic computational complexity of standard Transformers caused by the\nSoftmax attention. However, most of them simply swap Softmax with an efficient\nattention mechanism without considering the customized architectures specially\nfor the efficient attention. In this paper, we argue that the handcrafted\nvanilla Transformer architectures for Softmax attention may not be suitable for\nefficient Transformers. To address this issue, we propose a new framework to\nfind optimal architectures for efficient Transformers with the neural\narchitecture search (NAS) technique. The proposed method is validated on\npopular machine translation and image classification tasks. We observe that the\noptimal architecture of the efficient Transformer has the reduced computation\ncompared with that of the standard Transformer, but the general accuracy is\nless comparable. It indicates that the Softmax attention and efficient\nattention have their own distinctions but neither of them can simultaneously\nbalance the accuracy and efficiency well. This motivates us to mix the two\ntypes of attention to reduce the performance imbalance. Besides the search\nspaces that commonly used in existing NAS Transformer approaches, we propose a\nnew search space that allows the NAS algorithm to automatically search the\nattention variants along with architectures. Extensive experiments on WMT' 14\nEn-De and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that our searched architecture maintains\ncomparable accuracy to the standard Transformer with notably improved\ncomputational efficiency.",

    "abstract": "The most of CNN based super-resolution (SR) methods assume that the\ndegradation is known (\\eg, bicubic). These methods will suffer a severe\nperformance drop when the degradation is different from their assumption.\nTherefore, some approaches attempt to train SR networks with the complex\ncombination of multiple degradations to cover the real degradation space. To\nadapt to multiple unknown degradations, introducing an explicit degradation\nestimator can actually facilitate SR performance. However, previous explicit\ndegradation estimation methods usually predict Gaussian blur with the\nsupervision of groundtruth blur kernels, and estimation errors may lead to SR\nfailure. Thus, it is necessary to design a method that can extract implicit\ndiscriminative degradation representation. To this end, we propose a\nMeta-Learning based Region Degradation Aware SR Network (MRDA), including\nMeta-Learning Network (MLN), Degradation Extraction Network (DEN), and Region\nDegradation Aware SR Network (RDAN). To handle the lack of groundtruth\ndegradation, we use the MLN to rapidly adapt to the specific complex\ndegradation after several iterations and extract implicit degradation\ninformation. Subsequently, a teacher network MRDA$_{T}$ is designed to further\nutilize the degradation information extracted by MLN for SR. However, MLN\nrequires iterating on paired low-resolution (LR) and corresponding\nhigh-resolution (HR) images, which is unavailable in the inference phase.\nTherefore, we adopt knowledge distillation (KD) to make the student network\nlearn to directly extract the same implicit degradation representation (IDR) as\nthe teacher from LR images.",

    "abstract": "The development of accurate methods for multi-label classification (MLC) of\nremote sensing (RS) images is one of the most important research topics in RS.\nTo address MLC problems, the use of deep neural networks that require a high\nnumber of reliable training images annotated by multiple land-cover class\nlabels (multi-labels) have been found popular in RS. However, collecting such\nannotations is time-consuming and costly. A common procedure to obtain\nannotations at zero labeling cost is to rely on thematic products or\ncrowdsourced labels. As a drawback, these procedures come with the risk of\nlabel noise that can distort the learning process of the MLC algorithms. In the\nliterature, most label noise robust methods are designed for single label\nclassification (SLC) problems in computer vision (CV), where each image is\nannotated by a single label. Unlike SLC, label noise in MLC can be associated\nwith: 1) subtractive label-noise (a land cover class label is not assigned to\nan image while that class is present in the image); 2) additive label-noise (a\nland cover class label is assigned to an image although that class is not\npresent in the given image); and 3) mixed label-noise (a combination of both).\nIn this paper, we investigate three different noise robust CV SLC methods and\nadapt them to be robust for multi-label noise scenarios in RS. During\nexperiments we study the effects of different types of multi-label noise and\nevaluate the adapted methods rigorously. To this end, we also introduce a\nsynthetic multi-label noise injection strategy that is more adequate to\nsimulate operational scenarios compared to the uniform label noise injection\nstrategy, in which the labels of absent and present classes are flipped at\nuniform probability. Further, we study the relevance of different evaluation\nmetrics in MLC problems under noisy multi-labels.",

    "title": "Knowing Where and What: Unified Word Block Pretraining for Document  Understanding",
    "abstract": "Due to the complex layouts of documents, it is challenging to extract\ninformation for documents. Most previous studies develop multimodal pre-trained\nmodels in a self-supervised way. In this paper, we focus on the embedding\nlearning of word blocks containing text and layout information, and propose\nUTel, a language model with Unified TExt and Layout pre-training. Specifically,\nwe propose two pre-training tasks: Surrounding Word Prediction (SWP) for the\nlayout learning, and Contrastive learning of Word Embeddings (CWE) for\nidentifying different word blocks. Moreover, we replace the commonly used 1D\nposition embedding with a 1D clipped relative position embedding. In this way,\nthe joint training of Masked Layout-Language Modeling (MLLM) and two newly\nproposed tasks enables the interaction between semantic and spatial features in\na unified way. Additionally, the proposed UTel can process arbitrary-length\nsequences by removing the 1D position embedding, while maintaining competitive\nperformance. Extensive experimental results show UTel learns better joint\nrepresentations and achieves superior performance than previous methods on\nvarious downstream tasks, though requiring no image modality.

    "abstract": "The scarcity of available Internet of Things (IoT) datasets remains a\nlimiting factor in developing machine learning based security systems. Static\ndatasets get outdated due to evolving IoT threat landscape. Meanwhile, the\ntestbeds used to generate them are rarely published. This paper presents the\nGotham testbed, a reproducible and flexible network security testbed,\nimplemented as a middleware over the GNS3 emulator, that is extendable to\naccommodate new emulated devices, services or attackers. The testbed is used to\nbuild an IoT scenario composed of 100 emulated devices communicating via MQTT,\nCoAP and RTSP protocols in a topology composed of 30 switches and 10 routers.\nThe scenario presents three threat actors, including the entire Mirai botnet\nlifecycle and additional red-teaming tools performing DoS, scanning and various\nattacks targeting the MQTT and CoAP protocols. The generated network traffic\nand application logs can be used to capture datasets containing legitimate and\nattacking traces. We hope that researchers can leverage the testbed and adapt\nit to include other types of devices and state-of-the-art attacks to generate\nnew datasets that reflect the current threat landscape and IoT protocols.

    "abstract": "The study of natural and human-made processes often results in long sequences\nof temporally-ordered values, aka time series (TS). Such processes often\nconsist of multiple states, e.g. operating modes of a machine, such that state\nchanges in the observed processes result in changes in the distribution of\nshape of the measured values. Time series segmentation (TSS) tries to find such\nchanges in TS post-hoc to deduce changes in the data-generating process. TSS is\ntypically approached as an unsupervised learning problem aiming at the\nidentification of segments distinguishable by some statistical property.\nCurrent algorithms for TSS require domain-dependent hyper-parameters to be set\nby the user, make assumptions about the TS value distribution or the types of\ndetectable changes which limits their applicability. Common hyperparameters are\nthe measure of segment homogeneity and the number of change points, which are\nparticularly hard to tune for each data set. We present ClaSP, a novel, highly\naccurate, hyper-parameter-free and domain-agnostic method for TSS. ClaSP\nhierarchically splits a TS into two parts. A change point is determined by\ntraining a binary TS classifier for each possible split point and selecting the\none split that is best at identifying subsequences to be from either of the\npartitions. ClaSP learns its main two model-parameters from the data using two\nnovel bespoke algorithms. In our experimental evaluation using a benchmark of\n115 data sets, we show that ClaSP outperforms the state of the art in terms of\naccuracy and is fast and scalable. Furthermore, we highlight properties of\nClaSP using several real-world case studies.",

    "abstract": "In edge computing (EC), by offloading tasks to edge server or remote cloud,\nthe system performance can be improved greatly. However, since the traffic\ndistribution in EC is heterogeneous and dynamic, it is difficult for an\nindividual edge server to provide satisfactory computation service anytime and\nanywhere. This issue motivated the researchers to study the cooperation between\nedge servers. The previous server cooperation algorithms have disadvantages\nsince the cooperated region is limited within one-hop. However, the performance\nof EC can be improved further by releasing the restriction of cooperation\nregion. Even some works have extended the cooperated region to multi-hops, they\nfail to support the task offloading which is one of the core issues of edge\ncomputing. Therefore, we propose a new decentralized and borderless server\ncooperation algorithm for edge computing which takes task offloading strategy\ninto account, named CoNet. In CoNet, the cooperation region is not limited.\nEach server forms its own basic cooperation unit (BCU) and calculates its\nannounced capability based on BCU. The server's capability, the processing\ndelay, the task and calculation result forwarding delay are considered during\nthe calculation. The task division strategy bases on the real capability of\nhost-server and the announced capability of cooperation-servers.

    "abstract": "Drilling a hole on a curved surface with a desired angle is prone to failure\nwhen done manually, due to the difficulties in drill alignment and also\ninherent instabilities of the task, potentially causing injury and fatigue to\nthe workers. On the other hand, it can be impractical to fully automate such a\ntask in real manufacturing environments because the parts arriving at an\nassembly line can have various complex shapes where drill point locations are\nnot easily accessible, making automated path planning difficult. In this work,\nan adaptive admittance controller with 6 degrees of freedom is developed and\ndeployed on a KUKA LBR iiwa 7 cobot such that the operator is able to\nmanipulate a drill mounted on the robot with one hand comfortably and open\nholes on a curved surface with haptic guidance of the cobot and visual guidance\nprovided through an AR interface. Real-time adaptation of the admittance\ndamping provides more transparency when driving the robot in free space while\nensuring stability during drilling. After the user brings the drill\nsufficiently close to the drill target and roughly aligns to the desired\ndrilling angle, the haptic guidance module fine tunes the alignment first and\nthen constrains the user movement to the drilling axis only, after which the\noperator simply pushes the drill into the workpiece with minimal effort.

In this paper we propose an\nimprovement of EDFM which aims at overcoming these limitations computing an\nimproved coupling between fractures and the surrounding porous medium by a)\nrelaxing the linear pressure distribution assumption, b) accounting for\nimpermeable fractures modifying near-fracture transmissibilities. These results\nare achieved by solving different types of local problems with a fine\nconforming grid, and computing new transmissibilities (for connections between\nfractures and the surrounding porous medium and those through the porous medium\nitself near to the fractures). Such local problems are inspired from numerical\nupscaling techniques present in the literature.

Moreover, the predicted segmentations often fluctuate over time,\nsuggesting that temporal consistency cues are neglected or not fully utilized.\nIn this paper, we set out to tackle these issues, with the aim of achieving\nhighly detailed and more temporally stable mask predictions for VIS. We first\npropose the Video Mask Transfiner (VMT) method, capable of leveraging\nfine-grained high-resolution features thanks to a highly efficient video\ntransformer structure. Our VMT detects and groups sparse error-prone\nspatio-temporal regions of each tracklet in the video segment, which are then\nrefined using both local and instance-level cues. Second, we identify that the\ncoarse boundary annotations of the popular YouTube-VIS dataset constitute a\nmajor limiting factor.

To benchmark high-quality mask predictions for VIS, we\nintroduce the HQ-YTVIS dataset, consisting of a manually re-annotated test set\nand our automatically refined training data. We compare VMT with the most\nrecent state-of-the-art methods on the HQ-YTVIS, as well as the Youtube-VIS,\nOVIS and BDD100K MOTS benchmarks.

On the one hand, comprehensive scene understanding is\nindispensable, a lack of which would result in vulnerability to rare but\ncomplex traffic situations, such as the sudden emergence of unknown objects.\nHowever, reasoning from a global context requires access to sensors of multiple\ntypes and adequate fusion of multi-modal sensor signals, which is difficult to\nachieve. On the other hand, the lack of interpretability in learning models\nalso hampers the safety with unverifiable failure causes. In this paper, we\npropose a safety-enhanced autonomous driving framework, named Interpretable\nSensor Fusion Transformer(InterFuser), to fully process and fuse information\nfrom multi-modal multi-view sensors for achieving comprehensive scene\nunderstanding and adversarial event detection. Besides, intermediate\ninterpretable features are generated from our framework, which provide more\nsemantics and are exploited to better constrain actions to be within the safe\nsets. We conducted extensive experiments on CARLA benchmarks, where our model\noutperforms prior methods, ranking the first on the public CARLA Leaderboard.",

    "abstract": "Branch prediction is arguably one of the most important speculative\nmechanisms within a high-performance processor architecture. A common approach\nto improve branch prediction accuracy is to employ lengthy history records of\npreviously seen branch directions to capture distant correlations between\nbranches. The larger the history, the richer the information that the predictor\ncan exploit for discovering predictive patterns. However, without appropriate\nfiltering, such an approach may also heavily disorganize the predictor's\ninternal mechanisms, leading to diminishing returns. This paper studies a\nfundamental control-flow property: the sparsity in the correlation between\nbranches and recent history. First, we show that sparse branch correlations\nexist in standard applications and, more importantly, such correlations can be\ncomputed efficiently using sparse modeling methods. Second, we introduce a\nsparsity-aware branch prediction mechanism that can compactly encode and store\nsparse models to unlock essential performance opportunities. We evaluated our\napproach for various design parameters demonstrating MPKI improvements of up to\n42% (2.3% on average) with 2KB of additional storage overhead. Our\ncircuit-level evaluation of the design showed that it can operate within\naccepted branch prediction latencies, and under reasonable power and area\nlimitations.",

However, due to the ambiguous\nboundary, it is very time-consuming and labor-intensive to annotate camouflage\nobjects pixel-wisely (which takes ~ 60 minutes per image). In this paper, we\npropose the first weakly-supervised camouflaged object detection (COD) method,\nusing scribble annotations as supervision. To achieve this, we first construct\na scribble-based camouflaged object dataset with 4,040 images and corresponding\nscribble annotations. It is worth noting that annotating the scribbles used in\nour dataset takes only ~ 10 seconds per image, which is 360 times faster than\nper-pixel annotations. However, the network directly using scribble annotations\nfor supervision will fail to localize the boundary of camouflaged objects and\ntend to have inconsistent predictions since scribble annotations only describe\nthe primary structure of objects without details. To tackle this problem, we\npropose a novel consistency loss composed of two parts: a reliable cross-view\nloss to attain reliable consistency over different images, and a soft\ninside-view loss to maintain consistency inside a single prediction map.\nBesides, we observe that humans use semantic information to segment regions\nnear boundaries of camouflaged objects. Therefore, we design a feature-guided\nloss, which includes visual features directly extracted from images and\nsemantically significant features captured by models. Moreover, we propose a\nnovel network that detects camouflaged objects by scribble learning on\nstructural information and semantic relations.

Between May 2020 and\nApril 2021, we conducted 15 surveys asking the German population about the most\nimportant AI-related issues (total of N=14,988 respondents).

Then, to catalyze the development of\nSOD, we construct two large-scale Small Object Detection dAtasets (SODA),\nSODA-D and SODA-A, which focus on the Driving and Aerial scenarios\nrespectively. SODA-D includes 24704 high-quality traffic images and 277596\ninstances of 9 categories. For SODA-A, we harvest 2510 high-resolution aerial\nimages and annotate 800203 instances over 9 classes. The proposed datasets, as\nwe know, are the first-ever attempt to large-scale benchmarks with a vast\ncollection of exhaustively annotated instances tailored for multi-category SOD.\nFinally, we evaluate the performance of mainstream methods on SODA. We expect\nthe released benchmarks could facilitate the development of SOD and spawn more\nbreakthroughs in this field.

    "abstract": "We prove that a uniformly random automaton with $n$ states on a 2-letter\nalphabet has a synchronizing word of length $O(n^{1/2}\\log n)$ with high\nprobability (w.h.p.). That is to say, w.h.p. there exists a word $\\omega$ of\nsuch length, and a state $v_0$, such that $\\omega$ sends all states to $v_0$.\nPrior to this work, the best upper bound was the quasilinear bound\n$O(n\\log^3n)$ due to Nicaud (2016). The correct scaling exponent had been\nsubject to various estimates by other authors between $0.5$ and $0.56$ based on\nnumerical simulations, and our result confirms that the smallest one indeed\ngives a valid upper bound (with a log factor).\nOur proof introduces the concept of $w$-trees, for a word $w$, that is,\nautomata in which the $w$-transitions induce a (loop-rooted) tree. We prove a\nstrong structure result that says that, w.h.p., a random automaton on $n$\nstates is a $w$-tree for some word $w$ of length at most\n$(1+\\epsilon)\\log_2(n)$, for any $\\epsilon>0$. The existence of the (random)\nword $w$ is proved by the probabilistic method. This structure result is key to\nproving that a short synchronizing word exists.",

We propose to disentangle the\nper-provenance relevance probability and its contribution to the final veracity\nprobability in an interpretable way - the final veracity probability is\nproportional to a linear ensemble of per-provenance relevance probabilities.\nThis way, it can be clearly identified the relevance of which sources\ncontributes to what extent towards the final probability. We show that our\nsystem achieves state-of-the-art results on FEVER dataset comparable to\ntwo-stage systems typically used in traditional fact-checking pipelines, while\nit often uses significantly less parameters and computation.\nOur analysis shows that proposed approach further allows to learn not just\nwhich provenances are relevant, but also which provenances lead to supporting\nand which toward denying the claim, without direct supervision. This not only\nadds interpretability, but also allows to detect claims with conflicting\nevidence automatically. Furthermore, we study whether our model can learn\nfine-grained relevance cues while using coarse-grained supervision.

We survey BioPortal in terms of\nsyntactic modelling trends and common practices for OWL axioms and class\nframes. Our findings suggest that biomedical ontologies only share simple\nsyntactic structures in which OWL constructors are not deeply nested or\ncombined in a complex manner.

    "abstract": "Predicting outcomes in sports is important for teams, leagues, bettors,\nmedia, and fans. Given the growing amount of player tracking data, sports\nanalytics models are increasingly utilizing spatially-derived features built\nupon player tracking data. However, player-specific information, such as\nlocation, cannot readily be included as features themselves, since common\nmodeling techniques rely on vector input. Accordingly, spatially-derived\nfeatures are commonly constructed in relation to anchor objects, such as the\ndistance to a ball or goal, through global feature aggregations, or via\nrole-assignment schemes, where players are designated a distinct role in the\ngame. In doing so, we sacrifice inter-player and local relationships in favor\nof global ones. To address this issue, we introduce a sport-agnostic\ngraph-based representation of game states. We then use our proposed graph\nrepresentation as input to graph neural networks to predict sports outcomes.\nOur approach preserves permutation invariance and allows for flexible player\ninteraction weights. We demonstrate how our method provides statistically\nsignificant improvements over the state of the art for prediction tasks in both\nAmerican football and esports, reducing test set loss by 9% and 20%,\nrespectively.

We find that among these, only the\nformer has received significant attention in the literature. To remedy this, we\npropose FedVARP, a novel variance reduction algorithm applied at the server\nthat eliminates error due to partial client participation. To do so, the server\nsimply maintains in memory the most recent update for each client and uses\nthese as surrogate updates for the non-participating clients in every round.\nFurther, to alleviate the memory requirement at the server, we propose a novel\nclustering-based variance reduction algorithm ClusterFedVARP.

    "abstract": "Reservoir computing is a machine learning approach that can generate a\nsurrogate model of a dynamical system.

Recently, a simpler formulation, known as\nnext-generation reservoir computing, removes many algorithm metaparameters and\nidentifies a well-performing traditional reservoir computer, thus simplifying\ntraining even further. Here, we study a particularly challenging problem of\nlearning a dynamical system that has both disparate time scales and multiple\nco-existing dynamical states (attractors). We compare the next-generation and\ntraditional reservoir computer using metrics quantifying the geometry of the\nground-truth and forecasted attractors. For the studied four-dimensional\nsystem, the next-generation reservoir computing approach uses $\\sim 1.7 \\times$\nless training data, requires $10^3 \\times$ shorter `warm up' time, has fewer\nmetaparameters, and has an $\\sim 100\\times$ higher accuracy in predicting the\nco-existing attractor characteristics in comparison to a traditional reservoir\ncomputer.

To evaluate\npedestrian safety proactively, surrogate safety measures (SSMs) have been\nwidely used in traffic conflict-based studies as they do not require historical\ncrashes as inputs. However, most existing SSMs were developed based on the\nassumption that road users would maintain constant velocity and direction. Risk\nestimations based on this assumption are less unstable, more likely to be\nexaggerated, and unable to capture the evasive maneuvers of drivers.\nConsidering the limitations among existing SSMs, this study proposes a\nprobabilistic framework for estimating the risk of pedestrian-vehicle conflicts\nat intersections. The proposed framework loosen restrictions of constant speed\nby predicting trajectories using a Gaussian Process Regression and accounts for\nthe different possible driver maneuvers with a Random Forest model. Real-world\nLiDAR data collected at an intersection was used to evaluate the performance of\nthe proposed framework. The newly developed framework is able to identify all\npedestrian-vehicle conflicts. Compared to the Time-to-Collision, the proposed\nframework provides a more stable risk estimation and captures the evasive\nmaneuvers of vehicles.

    "abstract": "As inelastic design for wind is embraced by the engineering community, there\nis an increasing demand for computational tools that enable the investigation\nof the nonlinear behavior of wind-excited structures and subsequent development\nof performance criteria. To address this need, a probabilistic collapse\nassessment framework for steel structures is proposed in this paper. The\nframework is based on the integration of a high-fidelity fiber-based nonlinear\nstructural modeling environment with a wind-tunnel-informed stochastic wind\nload model to perform nonlinear time history analysis. General uncertainty is\npropagated using a stratified sampling scheme enabling the efficient estimation\nof reliabilities associated with rare events. The adopted models for simulating\nhigh-fidelity nonlinear structural behavior were found, in general, to be\nadequate for capturing phenomena, including progressive yielding, buckling, and\nlow-cycle fatigue, that are essential for wind induced collapse analysis. In\nparticular, the adopted fatigue model was found to be capable of predicting\ndamage and potential fiber/section fracture associated with non-fully reversing\nstress-strain cycles that are characteristic of wind loading. Through\nillustration on a 45-story archetype steel building, critical discussions on\nthe types of observed collapse mechanisms, the difference between alongwind and\nacrosswind nonlinear behavior, reliabilities associated with first yield, and\ncollapse are presented. A probabilistic description of the residual and peak\nstory drifts is also provided through development of fragility functions.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, Explainable AI (xAI) attracted a lot of attention as various\ncountries turned explanations into a legal right. xAI allows for improving\nmodels beyond the accuracy metric by, e.g., debugging the learned pattern and\ndemystifying the AI's behavior. The widespread use of xAI brought new\nchallenges. On the one hand, the number of published xAI algorithms underwent a\nboom, and it became difficult for practitioners to select the right tool. On\nthe other hand, some experiments did highlight how easy data scientists could\nmisuse xAI algorithms and misinterpret their results. To tackle the issue of\ncomparing and correctly using feature importance xAI algorithms, we propose\nCompare-xAI, a benchmark that unifies all exclusive and unitary evaluation\nmethods applied to xAI algorithms. We propose a selection protocol to shortlist\nnon-redundant unit tests from the literature, i.e., each targeting a specific\nproblem in explaining a model. The benchmark encapsulates the complexity of\nevaluating xAI methods into a hierarchical scoring of three levels, namely,\ntargeting three end-user groups: researchers, practitioners, and laymen in xAI.\nThe most detailed level provides one score per unit test. The second level\nregroups tests into five categories (fidelity, fragility, stability,\nsimplicity, and stress tests). The last level is the aggregated\ncomprehensibility score, which encapsulates the ease of correctly interpreting\nthe algorithm's output in one easy to compare value. Compare-xAI's interactive\nuser interface helps mitigate errors in interpreting xAI results by quickly\nlisting the recommended xAI solutions for each ML task and their current\nlimitations.

In this paper, an efficient and\neffective end-to-end network for automatic pavement crack segmentation, called\nRHA-Net, is proposed to improve the pavement crack segmentation accuracy. The\nRHA-Net is built by integrating residual blocks (ResBlocks) and hybrid\nattention blocks into the encoder-decoder architecture. The ResBlocks are used\nto improve the ability of RHA-Net to extract high-level abstract features. The\nhybrid attention blocks are designed to fuse both low-level features and\nhigh-level features to help the model focus on correct channels and areas of\ncracks, thereby improving the feature presentation ability of RHA-Net. An image\ndata set containing 789 pavement crack images collected by a self-designed\nmobile robot is constructed and used for training and evaluating the proposed\nmodel. Compared with other state-of-the-art networks, the proposed model\nachieves better performance and the functionalities of adding residual blocks\nand hybrid attention mechanisms are validated in a comprehensive ablation\nstudy. Additionally, a light-weighted version of the model generated by\nintroducing depthwise separable convolution achieves better a performance and a\nmuch faster processing speed with 1/30 of the number of U-Net parameters.

    "abstract": "The recently proposed DEtection TRansformer (DETR) has established a fully\nend-to-end paradigm for object detection. However, DETR suffers from slow\ntraining convergence, which hinders its applicability to various detection\ntasks. We observe that DETR's slow convergence is largely attributed to the\ndifficulty in matching object queries to relevant regions due to the unaligned\nsemantics between object queries and encoded image features. With this\nobservation, we design Semantic-Aligned-Matching DETR++ (SAM-DETR++) to\naccelerate DETR's convergence and improve detection performance. The core of\nSAM-DETR++ is a plug-and-play module that projects object queries and encoded\nimage features into the same feature embedding space, where each object query\ncan be easily matched to relevant regions with similar semantics. Besides,\nSAM-DETR++ searches for multiple representative keypoints and exploits their\nfeatures for semantic-aligned matching with enhanced representation capacity.\nFurthermore, SAM-DETR++ can effectively fuse multi-scale features in a\ncoarse-to-fine manner on the basis of the designed semantic-aligned matching.\nExtensive experiments show that the proposed SAM-DETR++ achieves superior\nconvergence speed and competitive detection accuracy. Additionally, as a\nplug-and-play method, SAM-DETR++ can complement existing DETR convergence\nsolutions with even better performance, achieving 44.8% AP with merely 12\ntraining epochs and 49.1% AP with 50 training epochs on COCO val2017 with\nResNet-50.

Though significant progress has been made, interactiveness\nlearning remains a challenging problem in HOI detection: existing methods\nusually generate redundant negative H-O pair proposals and fail to effectively\nextract interactive pairs. Though interactiveness has been studied in both\nwhole body- and part- level and facilitates the H-O pairing, previous works\nonly focus on the target person once (i.e., in a local perspective) and\noverlook the information of the other persons. In this paper, we argue that\ncomparing body-parts of multi-person simultaneously can afford us more useful\nand supplementary interactiveness cues.

    "abstract": "Exemplar-free Class-incremental Learning (CIL) is a challenging problem\nbecause rehearsing data from previous phases is strictly prohibited, causing\ncatastrophic forgetting of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In this paper, we\npresent iVoro, a holistic framework for CIL, derived from computational\ngeometry. We found Voronoi Diagram (VD), a classical model for space\nsubdivision, is especially powerful for solving the CIL problem, because VD\nitself can be constructed favorably in an incremental manner -- the newly added\nsites (classes) will only affect the proximate classes, making the\nnon-contiguous classes hardly forgettable. Further, in order to find a better\nset of centers for VD construction, we colligate DNN with VD using Power\nDiagram and show that the VD structure can be optimized by integrating local\nDNN models using a divide-and-conquer algorithm. Moreover, our VD construction\nis not restricted to the deep feature space, but is also applicable to multiple\nintermediate feature spaces, promoting VD to be multi-centered VD (CIVD) that\nefficiently captures multi-grained features from DNN. Importantly, iVoro is\nalso capable of handling uncertainty-aware test-time Voronoi cell assignment\nand has exhibited high correlations between geometric uncertainty and\npredictive accuracy (up to ~0.9). Putting everything together, iVoro achieves\nup to 25.26%, 37.09%, and 33.21% improvements on CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet, and\nImageNet-Subset, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art non-exemplar\nCIL approaches.

While task intent understanding is an\nessential part of natural language understanding, less effort is made to\nresolve ambiguity that may arise while grounding the task.

    "abstract": "The participation of consumers and producers in demand response programs has\nincreased in smart grids, which reduces investment and operation costs of power\nsystems. Also, with the advent of renewable energy sources, the electricity\nmarket is becoming more complex and unpredictable. To effectively implement\ndemand response programs, forecasting the future price of electricity is very\ncrucial for producers in the electricity market. Electricity prices are very\nvolatile and change under the influence of various factors such as temperature,\nwind speed, rainfall, intensity of commercial and daily activities, etc.\nTherefore, considering the influencing factors as dependent variables can\nincrease the accuracy of the forecast. In this paper, a model for electricity\nprice forecasting is presented based on Gated Recurrent Units. The electrical\nload consumption is considered as an input variable in this model. Noise in\nelectricity price seriously reduces the efficiency and effectiveness of\nanalysis. Therefore, an adaptive noise reducer is integrated into the model for\nnoise reduction. The SAEs are then used to extract features from the de-noised\nelectricity price. Finally, the de-noised features are fed into the GRU to\ntrain predictor. Results on real dataset shows that the proposed methodology\ncan perform effectively in prediction of electricity price.",

    "abstract": "This paper develops and benchmarks an immersed peridynamics method to\nsimulate the deformation, damage, and failure of hyperelastic materials within\na fluid-structure interaction framework. The immersed peridynamics method\ndescribes an incompressible structure immersed in a viscous incompressible\nfluid. It expresses the momentum equation and incompressibility constraint in\nEulerian form, and it describes the structural motion and resultant forces in\nLagrangian form. Coupling between Eulerian and Lagrangian variables is achieved\nby integral transforms with Dirac delta function kernels, as in standard\nimmersed boundary (IB) methods. The major difference between our approach and\nconventional IB methods is that we use peridynamics, instead of classical\ncontinuum mechanics, to determine the structural forces. We focus on\nnon-ordinary state-based peridynamic material descriptions that allow us to use\na constitutive correspondence framework that can leverage well characterized\nnonlinear constitutive models of soft materials. The convergence and accuracy\nof our approach are compared to both conventional and immersed finite element\nmethods using widely used benchmark problems of nonlinear incompressible\nelasticity. We demonstrate that the immersed peridynamics method yields\ncomparable accuracy with similar numbers of structural degrees of freedom for\nseveral choices of the size of the peridynamic horizon.

Machine\nlearning and particularly Deep Learning (DL) has become the main re-id tool\nthat allowed researches to achieve unprecedented accuracy levels on benchmark\ndatasets. However, there is a known problem of poor generalization of DL\nmodels. That is, models trained to achieve high accuracy on one dataset perform\npoorly on other ones and require re-training. To address this issue, we present\na model without trainable parameters which shows great potential for high\ngeneralization. It combines a fully analytical feature extraction and\nsimilarity ranking scheme with DL-based human parsing used to obtain the\ninitial subregion classification. We show that such combination to a high\nextent eliminates the drawbacks of existing analytical methods. We use\ninterpretable color and texture features which have human-readable similarity\nmeasures associated with them. To verify the proposed method we conduct\nexperiments on Market1501 and CUHK03 datasets achieving competitive rank-1\naccuracy comparable with that of DL-models. Most importantly we show that our\nmethod achieves 63.9% and 93.5% rank-1 cross-domain accuracy when applied to\ntransfer learning tasks. It is significantly higher than previously reported\n30-50% transfer accuracy. We discuss the potential ways of adding new features\nto further improve the model.

These services might reduce space consumption in cities as\nfewer parking spaces are required if private vehicle trips are replaced.

Simulations help to identify the actual impact of MoD on a traffic\nsystem, evaluate new control algorithms for improved service efficiency and\ndevelop guidelines for regulatory measures. This paper presents the open-source\nagent-based simulation framework FleetPy.

It specially focuses on the modeling of interactions of users\nwith operators while its flexibility allows the integration and embedding of\nmultiple operators in the overall transportation system.

Model uncertainty in time-invariant\nsystems can be reduced by recently proposed learning-based methods, thus\nimproving the performance of robust controllers using data. However, in\npractice, many systems also exhibit uncertainty in the form of changes over\ntime, e.g., due to weight shifts or wear and tear, leading to decreased\nperformance or instability of the learning-based controller. We propose an\nevent-triggered learning algorithm that decides when to learn in the face of\nuncertainty in the LQR problem with rare or slow changes. Our key idea is to\nswitch between robust and learned controllers. For learning, we first\napproximate the optimal length of the learning phase via Monte-Carlo\nestimations using a probabilistic model. We then design a statistical test for\nuncertain systems based on the moment-generating function of the LQR cost. The\ntest detects changes in the system under control and triggers re-learning when\ncontrol performance deteriorates due to system changes.

Recently, generalist\nTransformer architectures have achieved impressive results in tasks such as\noptical flow and depth estimation by encoding geometric priors as inputs rather\nthan as enforced constraints. In this paper, we extend this idea and propose to\nlearn an implicit, multi-view consistent scene representation, introducing a\nseries of 3D data augmentation techniques as a geometric inductive prior to\nincrease view diversity. We also show that introducing view synthesis as an\nauxiliary task further improves depth estimation. Our Depth Field Networks\n(DeFiNe) achieve state-of-the-art results in stereo and video depth estimation\nwithout explicit geometric constraints, and improve on zero-shot domain\ngeneralization by a wide margin.",

    "abstract": "Deep generative models make visual content creation more accessible to novice\nusers by automating the synthesis of diverse, realistic content based on a\ncollected dataset. However, the current machine learning approaches miss a key\nelement of the creative process -- the ability to synthesize things that go far\nbeyond the data distribution and everyday experience. To begin to address this\nissue, we enable a user to \"warp\" a given model by editing just a handful of\noriginal model outputs with desired geometric changes. Our method applies a\nlow-rank update to a single model layer to reconstruct edited examples.\nFurthermore, to combat overfitting, we propose a latent space augmentation\nmethod based on style-mixing. Our method allows a user to create a model that\nsynthesizes endless objects with defined geometric changes, enabling the\ncreation of a new generative model without the burden of curating a large-scale\ndataset. We also demonstrate that edited models can be composed to achieve\naggregated effects, and we present an interactive interface to enable users to\ncreate new models through composition. Empirical measurements on multiple test\ncases suggest the advantage of our method against recent GAN fine-tuning\nmethods. Finally, we showcase several applications using the edited models,\nincluding latent space interpolation and image editing.",

To improve robustness, particularly of recent\nadversarial texture optimization, we develop an explicit initialization and an\nalignment procedure. It deals with complex geometry due to a robust mapping of\nthe geometry to the texture map and a hard-assignment-based initialization. It\ndeals with misalignment of geometry and images by integrating fast\nimage-alignment into the texture refinement optimization.

    "abstract": "Recent speaker diarization studies showed that integration of end-to-end\nneural diarization (EEND) and clustering-based diarization is a promising\napproach for achieving state-of-the-art performance on various tasks. Such an\napproach first divides an observed signal into fixed-length segments, then\nperforms {\\it segment-level} local diarization based on an EEND module, and\nmerges the segment-level results via clustering to form a final global\ndiarization result. The segmentation is done to limit the number of speakers in\neach segment since the current EEND cannot handle a large number of speakers.\nIn this paper, we argue that such an approach involving the segmentation has\nseveral issues; for example, it inevitably faces a dilemma that larger segment\nsizes increase both the context available for enhancing the performance and the\nnumber of speakers for the local EEND module to handle. To resolve such a\nproblem, this paper proposes a novel framework that performs diarization\nwithout segmentation. However, it can still handle challenging data containing\nmany speakers and a significant amount of overlapping speech. The proposed\nmethod can take an entire meeting for inference and perform {\\it\nutterance-by-utterance} diarization that clusters utterance activities in terms\nof speakers. To this end, we leverage a neural network training scheme called\nGraph-PIT proposed recently for neural source separation.

    "title": "HelixFold-Single: MSA-free Protein Structure Prediction by Using Protein  Language Model as an Alternative",
    "abstract": "AI-based protein structure prediction pipelines, such as AlphaFold2, have\nachieved near-experimental accuracy. These advanced pipelines mainly rely on\nMultiple Sequence Alignments (MSAs) and templates as inputs to learn the\nco-evolution information from the homologous sequences. Nonetheless, searching\nMSAs and templates from protein databases is time-consuming, usually taking\ndozens of minutes. Consequently, we attempt to explore the limits of fast\nprotein structure prediction by using only primary sequences of proteins.\nHelixFold-Single is proposed to combine a large-scale protein language model\nwith the superior geometric learning capability of AlphaFold2. Our proposed\nmethod, HelixFold-Single, first pre-trains a large-scale protein language model\n(PLM) with thousands of millions of primary sequences utilizing the\nself-supervised learning paradigm, which will be used as an alternative to MSAs\nand templates for learning the co-evolution information. Then, by combining the\npre-trained PLM and the essential components of AlphaFold2, we obtain an\nend-to-end differentiable model to predict the 3D coordinates of atoms from\nonly the primary sequence. HelixFold-Single is validated in datasets CASP14 and\nCAMEO, achieving competitive accuracy with the MSA-based methods on the targets\nwith large homologous families. Furthermore, HelixFold-Single consumes much\nless time than the mainstream pipelines for protein structure prediction,\ndemonstrating its potential in tasks requiring many predictions. The code of\nHelixFold-Single is available at\nhttps://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleHelix/tree/dev/apps/protein_folding/helixfold-single,\nand we also provide stable web services on\nhttps://paddlehelix.baidu.com/app/drug/protein-single/forecast.",

    "abstract": "In many daily-life scenarios, acoustic sources recorded in an enclosure can\nonly be observed with other interfering sources. Hence, convolutive Blind\nSource Separation (BSS) is a central problem in audio signal processing.\nMethods based on Independent Component Analysis (ICA) are especially important\nin this field as they require only few and weak assumptions and allow for\nblindness regarding the original source signals and the acoustic propagation\npath. Most of the currently used algorithms belong to one of the following\nthree families: Frequency Domain ICA (FD-ICA), Independent Vector Analysis\n(IVA), and TRIple-N Independent component analysis for CONvolutive mixtures\n(TRINICON). While the relation between ICA, FD-ICA and IVA becomes apparent due\nto their construction, the relation to TRINICON is not well established yet.\nThis paper fills this gap by providing an in-depth treatment of the common\nbuilding blocks of these algorithms and their differences, and thus provides a\ncommon framework for all considered algorithms.",

Coefficients of the\ntransfer function of the plant nominal model with stable zeros are unknown and\nbelong to a known bounded polyhedron in the space of coefficients.

We document five main hypotheses reported by domain experts,\ndescribing their expectations regarding the variability of the flows generated\nby the distinct solver configurations. We contribute three evaluation protocols\nto assess the validation of the above hypotheses by two comparison measures:\n(i) a standard distance used in scientific imaging (the L2 norm) and (ii) an\nestablished topological distance between persistence diagrams (the\nL2-Wasserstein metric). Extensive experiments on the input ensemble demonstrate\nthe superiority of the topological distance (ii) to report as close to each\nother flows which are expected to be similar by domain experts, due to the\nconfiguration of their vortices. Overall, the insights reported by our study\nbring an experimental evidence of the suitability of TDA for representing and\ncomparing turbulent flows, thereby providing to the fluid dynamics community\nconfidence for its usage in future work.

To\nguarantee the high fidelity of the execution result of a quantum algorithm, it\nis crucial to inform users of the noises of the used quantum computer and the\ncompiled physical circuits. However, an intuitive and systematic way to make\nusers aware of the quantum computing noise is still missing. In this paper, we\nfill the gap by proposing a novel visualization approach to achieve noise-aware\nquantum computing. It provides a holistic picture of the noise of quantum\ncomputing through multiple interactively coordinated views: a Computer\nEvolution View with a circuit-like design overviews the temporal evolution of\nthe noises of different quantum computers, a Circuit Filtering View facilitates\nquick filtering of multiple compiled physical circuits for the same quantum\nalgorithm, and a Circuit Comparison View with a coupled bar chart enables\ndetailed comparison of the filtered compiled circuits.

Since the population of asteroids affected by these\nresonances is, in some cases, of the order of several thousand, this has become\na taxing task for a human observer. Recent works used Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNN) models to perform such task automatically.

Reliable uncertainty quantification is crucial and is a\nstep towards increased trust in AI results. It becomes especially important in\nhigh-stakes decision-making, where the true output must be within the\nconfidence set with high probability. Conformal prediction (CP) is a\ndistribution-free uncertainty quantification framework that works for any\nblack-box model and yields prediction intervals (PIs) that are valid under the\nmild assumption of exchangeability. CP-type methods are gaining popularity due\nto being easy to implement and computationally cheap; however, the\nexchangeability assumption immediately excludes time series forecasting.\nAlthough recent papers tackle covariate shift, this is not enough for the\ngeneral time series forecasting problem of producing H-step ahead valid PIs.

Training on these re-labeled LIDC nodules leads to improved model\nperformance, which is enhanced when new labels of uncertain nodules are added.\nWe further infer that re-labeling LIDC is current an expedient way for robust\nlung cancer prediction while building a large pathological-proven nodule\ndatabase provides the long-term solution.",

    "abstract": "Decentralization is a widespread concept across disciplines such as\nEconomics, Political Science and Computer Science, which use it in distinct but\noverlapping ways. Here, we investigate the scholarly history of the term by\nanalysing $425k$ academic publications mentioning (de)centralization. We reveal\nthat the fraction of papers on the topic has been exponentially increasing\nsince the 1950s, with 1 author in 154 contributing to a paper on\n(de)centralization in 2021. We then cluster papers using both semantic and\ncitation information and show that the topic has independently emerged in\ndifferent fields, while cross-disciplinary contamination started only more\nrecently. Finally, focusing on the two most prominent clusters by number of\npapers and influence, we show how Blockchain has become the most influential\nfield about 10 years ago, while Governance dominated before the 1990s, and we\ncharacterize their interactions with other fields. Our results add a\nquantitative dimension to the history of a key yet elusive concept.\nFurthermore, the introduced framework is general and our publicly",

In the case of quantum relative entropies, we start from a given\nquantum relative entropy $D^{q}$, and define a family of quantum relative\nentropies by \\begin{align*}\nD^{q,\\#_{\\gamma}}(\\rho\\|\\sigma):=\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}D^q(\\rho\\|\\sigma\\#_{\\gamma}\\rho),\\quad\\quad\n\\gamma\\in(0,1), \\end{align*} where $\\sigma\\#_{\\gamma}\\rho$ is the Kubo-Ando\n$\\gamma$-weighted geometric mean. In the case of R\\'enyi divergences, we start\nfrom two quantum relative entropies $D^{q_0}$ and $D^{q_1}$, and define a\nquantum R\\'enyi $\\alpha$-divergence by the variational formula $$\nD^{\\mathrm{b},(q_0,q_1)} :=\\inf_{\\omega\\in\\mathcal{S}(\\mathcal{H})}\\left\\{\n\\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha}D^{q_0}(\\omega\\|\\rho)+D^{q_1}(\\omega\\|\\sigma)\n\\right\\}.$$ We analyze the properties of these quantities in detail, and\nillustrate the general constructions by various concrete examples.",
