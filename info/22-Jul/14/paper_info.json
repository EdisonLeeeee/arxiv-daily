    "abstract": "Standard neural networks can approximate general nonlinear operators,\nrepresented either explicitly by a combination of mathematical operators, e.g.,\nin an advection-diffusion-reaction partial differential equation, or simply as\na black box, e.g., a system-of-systems. The first neural operator was the Deep\nOperator Network (DeepONet), proposed in 2019 based on rigorous approximation\ntheory. Since then, a few other less general operators have been published,\ne.g., based on graph neural networks or Fourier transforms. For black box\nsystems, training of neural operators is data-driven only but if the governing\nequations are known they can be incorporated into the loss function during\ntraining to develop physics-informed neural operators. Neural operators can be\nused as surrogates in design problems, uncertainty quantification, autonomous\nsystems, and almost in any application requiring real-time inference. Moreover,\nindependently pre-trained DeepONets can be used as components of a complex\nmulti-physics system by coupling them together with relatively light training.\nHere, we present a review of DeepONet, the Fourier neural operator, and the\ngraph neural operator, as well as appropriate extensions with feature\nexpansions, and highlight their usefulness in diverse applications in\ncomputational mechanics, including porous media, fluid mechanics, and solid\nmechanics.",

    "title": "Towards Highly Expressive Machine Learning Models of Non-Melanoma Skin  Cancer",
    "abstract": "Pathologists have a rich vocabulary with which they can describe all the\nnuances of cellular morphology. In their world, there is a natural pairing of\nimages and words. Recent advances demonstrate that machine learning models can\nnow be trained to learn high-quality image features and represent them as\ndiscrete units of information. This enables natural language, which is also\ndiscrete, to be jointly modelled alongside the imaging, resulting in a\ndescription of the contents of the imaging. Here we present experiments in\napplying discrete modelling techniques to the problem domain of non-melanoma\nskin cancer, specifically, histological images of Intraepidermal Carcinoma\n(IEC). Implementing a VQ-GAN model to reconstruct high-resolution (256x256)\nimages of IEC images, we trained a sequence-to-sequence transformer to generate\nnatural language descriptions using pathologist terminology. Combined with the\nidea of interactive concept vectors available by using continuous generative\nmethods, we demonstrate an additional angle of interpretability. The result is\na promising means of working towards highly expressive machine learning systems\nwhich are not only useful as predictive/classification tools, but also means to\nfurther our scientific understanding of disease.",

    "title": "FD-GATDR: A Federated-Decentralized-Learning Graph Attention Network for  Doctor Recommendation Using EHR",
    "abstract": "In the past decade, with the development of big data technology, an\nincreasing amount of patient information has been stored as electronic health\nrecords (EHRs). Leveraging these data, various doctor recommendation systems\nhave been proposed. Typically, such studies process the EHR data in a\nflat-structured manner, where each encounter was treated as an unordered set of\nfeatures. Nevertheless, the heterogeneous structured information such as\nservice sequence stored in claims shall not be ignored. This paper presents a\ndoctor recommendation system with time embedding to reconstruct the potential\nconnections between patients and doctors using heterogeneous graph attention\nnetwork. Besides, to address the privacy issue of patient data sharing crossing\nhospitals, a federated decentralized learning method based on a minimization\noptimization model is also proposed. The graph-based recommendation system has\nbeen validated on a EHR dataset. Compared to baseline models, the proposed\nmethod improves the AUC by up to 6.2%. And our proposed federated-based\nalgorithm not only yields the fictitious fusion center's performance but also\nenjoys a convergence rate of O(1/T).",

    "abstract": "In this work we evaluate the applicability of an ensemble of population\nmodels and machine learning models to predict the near future evolution of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, with a particular use case in Spain. We rely solely in open\nand public datasets, fusing incidence, vaccination, human mobility and weather\ndata to feed our machine learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting,\nk-Nearest Neighbours and Kernel Ridge Regression). We use the incidence data to\nadjust classic population models (Gompertz, Logistic, Richards, Bertalanffy) in\norder to be able to better capture the trend of the data. We then ensemble\nthese two families of models in order to obtain a more robust and accurate\nprediction. Furthermore, we have observed an improvement in the predictions\nobtained with machine learning models as we add new features (vaccines,\nmobility, climatic conditions), analyzing the importance of each of them using\nShapley Additive Explanation values. As in any other modelling work, data and\npredictions quality have several limitations and therefore they must be seen\nfrom a critical standpoint, as we discuss in the text. Our work concludes that\nthe ensemble use of these models improves the individual predictions (using\nonly machine learning models or only population models) and can be applied,\nwith caution, in cases when compartmental models cannot be utilized due to the\nlack of relevant data.",

    "abstract": "A counter-intuitive property of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is their\ninherent susceptibility to adversarial examples, which severely hinders the\napplication of CNNs in security-critical fields. Adversarial examples are\nsimilar to original examples but contain malicious perturbations. Adversarial\ntraining is a simple and effective training method to improve the robustness of\nCNNs to adversarial examples. The mechanisms behind adversarial examples and\nadversarial training are worth exploring. Therefore, this work investigates\nsimilarities and differences between two types of CNNs (both normal and robust\nones) in information extraction by observing the trends towards the mutual\ninformation. We show that 1) the amount of mutual information that CNNs extract\nfrom original and adversarial examples is almost similar, whether CNNs are in\nnormal training or adversarial training; the reason why adversarial examples\nmislead CNNs may be that they contain more texture-based information about\nother categories; 2) compared with normal training, adversarial training is\nmore difficult and the amount of information extracted by the robust CNNs is\nless; 3) the CNNs trained with different methods have different preferences for\ncertain types of information; normally trained CNNs tend to extract\ntexture-based information from the inputs, while adversarially trained models\nprefer to shape-based information. Furthermore, we also analyze the mutual\ninformation estimators used in this work, kernel-density-estimation and binning\nmethods, and find that these estimators outline the geometric properties of the\nmiddle layer's output to a certain extent.",

In this work we bridge this gap by\nproposing a holistic conceptualization of conversation quality, building upon\nthe collaborative attributes of cooperative conversation floors. Taking a\nmultilevel perspective of conversation, we develop and validate two instruments\nfor perceived conversation quality (PCQ) at the individual and group levels.\nSpecifically, we motivate capturing external raters' gestalt impressions of\nparticipant experiences from thin slices of behavior, and collect annotations\nof PCQ on the publicly available MatchNMingle dataset of in-the-wild mingling\nconversations.

    "abstract": "Dam reservoirs play an important role in meeting sustainable development\ngoals and global climate targets. However, particularly for small dam\nreservoirs, there is a lack of consistent data on their geographical location.\nTo address this data gap, a promising approach is to perform automated dam\nreservoir extraction based on globally available remote sensing imagery. It can\nbe considered as a fine-grained task of water body extraction, which involves\nextracting water areas in images and then separating dam reservoirs from\nnatural water bodies. We propose a novel deep neural network (DNN) based\npipeline that decomposes dam reservoir extraction into water body segmentation\nand dam reservoir recognition. Water bodies are firstly separated from\nbackground lands in a segmentation model and each individual water body is then\npredicted as either dam reservoir or natural water body in a classification\nmodel. For the former step, point-level metric learning with triplets across\nimages is injected into the segmentation model to address contour ambiguities\nbetween water areas and land regions. For the latter step, prior-guided metric\nlearning with triplets from clusters is injected into the classification model\nto optimize the image embedding space in a fine-grained level based on\nreservoir clusters. To facilitate future research, we establish a benchmark\ndataset with earth imagery data and human labelled reservoirs from river basins\nin West Africa and India. Extensive experiments were conducted on this\nbenchmark in the water body segmentation task, dam reservoir recognition task,\nand the joint dam reservoir extraction task. Superior performance has been\nobserved in the respective tasks when comparing our method with state of the\nart approaches.",

    "abstract": "We propose a general, flexible, and scalable framework dpart, an open source\nPython library for differentially private synthetic data generation. Central to\nthe approach is autoregressive modelling -- breaking the joint data\ndistribution to a sequence of lower-dimensional conditional distributions,\ncaptured by various methods such as machine learning models (logistic/linear\nregression, decision trees, etc.), simple histogram counts, or custom\ntechniques. The library has been created with a view to serve as a quick and\naccessible baseline as well as to accommodate a wide audience of users, from\nthose making their first steps in synthetic data generation, to more\nexperienced ones with domain expertise who can configure different aspects of\nthe modelling and contribute new methods/mechanisms. Specific instances of\ndpart include Independent, an optimized version of PrivBayes, and a newly\nproposed model, dp-synthpop.\nCode: https://github.com/hazy/dpart",

    "abstract": "The popularity of machine learning has increased the risk of unfair models\ngetting deployed in high-stake applications, such as justice system,\ndrug/vaccination design, and medical diagnosis. Although there are effective\nmethods to train fair models from scratch, how to automatically reveal and\nexplain the unfairness of a trained model remains a challenging task. Revealing\nunfairness of machine learning models in interpretable fashion is a critical\nstep towards fair and trustworthy AI. In this paper, we systematically tackle\nthe novel task of revealing unfair models by mining interpretable evidence\n(RUMIE). The key idea is to find solid evidence in the form of a group of data\ninstances discriminated most by the model. To make the evidence interpretable,\nwe also find a set of human-understandable key attributes and decision rules\nthat characterize the discriminated data instances and distinguish them from\nthe other non-discriminated data. As demonstrated by extensive experiments on\nmany real-world data sets, our method finds highly interpretable and solid\nevidence to effectively reveal the unfairness of trained models. Moreover, it\nis much more scalable than all of the baseline methods.",

    "abstract": "Identifying spans in medical texts that correspond to medical entities is one\nof the core steps for many healthcare NLP tasks such as ICD coding, medical\nfinding extraction, medical note contextualization, to name a few. Existing\nentity extraction methods rely on a fixed and limited vocabulary of medical\nentities and have difficulty with extracting entities represented by disjoint\nspans. In this paper, we present a new transformer-based architecture called\nOSLAT, Open Set Label Attention Transformer, that addresses many of the\nlimitations of the previous methods. Our approach uses the label-attention\nmechanism to implicitly learn spans associated with entities of interest. These\nentities can be provided as free text, including entities not seen during\nOSLAT's training, and the model can extract spans even when they are disjoint.\nTo test the generalizability of our method, we train two separate models on two\ndifferent datasets, which have very low entity overlap: (1) a public discharge\nnotes dataset from hNLP, and (2) a much more challenging proprietary patient\ntext dataset \"Reasons for Encounter\" (RFE). We find that OSLAT models trained\non either dataset outperform rule-based and fuzzy string matching baselines\nwhen applied to the RFE dataset as well as to the portion of hNLP dataset where\nentities are represented by disjoint spans.

Furthermore, in case\nthe lower-level problem is nonconvex, the strong duality does not hold\nrendering the single-level reduction techniques inapplicable.

The approximation function is constructed by\ntraining a deep convolutional neural network. The numerical procedure is run\niteratively to enhance the accuracy.\nAs a case study, the proposed method is applied to a price-maker energy\nstorage optimal bidding problem that considers an AC power flow-based market\nclearing in the lower level.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of global reward maximization with only\npartial distributed feedback. This problem is motivated by several real-world\napplications (e.g., cellular network configuration, dynamic pricing, and policy\nselection) where an action taken by a central entity influences a large\npopulation that contributes to the global reward. However, collecting such\nreward feedback from the entire population not only incurs a prohibitively high\ncost but often leads to privacy concerns. To tackle this problem, we consider\ndifferentially private distributed linear bandits, where only a subset of users\nfrom the population are selected (called clients) to participate in the\nlearning process and the central server learns the global model from such\npartial feedback by iteratively aggregating these clients' local feedback in a\ndifferentially private fashion. We then propose a unified algorithmic learning\nframework, called differentially private distributed phased elimination\n(DP-DPE), which can be naturally integrated with popular differential privacy\n(DP) models (including central DP, local DP, and shuffle DP). Furthermore, we\nprove that DP-DPE achieves both sublinear regret and sublinear communication\ncost. Interestingly, DP-DPE also achieves privacy protection \"for free\" in the\nsense that the additional cost due to privacy guarantees is a lower-order\nadditive term. In addition, as a by-product of our techniques, the same results\nof \"free\" privacy can also be achieved for the standard differentially private\nlinear bandits. Finally, we conduct simulations to corroborate our theoretical\nresults and demonstrate the effectiveness of DP-DPE.",

Compared with the existing scrambling-based audio cancellation\napproaches, NEC can selectively remove a target speaker's voice from a mixed\nspeech without causing interference to others. Specifically, for a target\nspeaker, we design a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model to extract high-level\nspeaker-specific but utterance-independent vocal features from his/her\nreference audios. When the microphone is recording, the DNN generates a shadow\nsound to cancel the target voice in real-time.

By leveraging the non-linearity of the microphone circuit, the\nmicrophone can accurately decode the shadow sound for target voice\ncancellation.

    "abstract": "Designing efficient general-purpose contextual bandit algorithms that work\nwith large -- or even continuous -- action spaces would facilitate application\nto important scenarios such as information retrieval, recommendation systems,\nand continuous control. While obtaining standard regret guarantees can be\nhopeless, alternative regret notions have been proposed to tackle the large\naction setting. We propose a smooth regret notion for contextual bandits, which\ndominates previously proposed alternatives. We design a statistically and\ncomputationally efficient algorithm -- for the proposed smooth regret -- that\nworks with general function approximation under standard supervised oracles. We\nalso present an adaptive algorithm that automatically adapts to any smoothness\nlevel. Our algorithms can be used to recover the previous minimax/Pareto\noptimal guarantees under the standard regret, e.g., in bandit problems with\nmultiple best arms and Lipschitz/H{\\\"o}lder bandits. We conduct large-scale\nempirical evaluations demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Optimistic algorithms have been extensively studied for regret minimization\nin episodic tabular MDPs, both from a minimax and an instance-dependent view.\nHowever, for the PAC RL problem, where the goal is to identify a near-optimal\npolicy with high probability, little is known about their instance-dependent\nsample complexity. A negative result of Wagenmaker et al. (2021) suggests that\noptimistic sampling rules cannot be used to attain the (still elusive) optimal\ninstance-dependent sample complexity. On the positive side, we provide the\nfirst instance-dependent bound for an optimistic algorithm for PAC RL,\nBPI-UCRL, for which only minimax guarantees were available (Kaufmann et al.,\n2021). While our bound features some minimal visitation probabilities, it also\nfeatures a refined notion of sub-optimality gap compared to the value gaps that\nappear in prior work. Moreover, in MDPs with deterministic transitions, we show\nthat BPI-UCRL is actually near-optimal. On the technical side, our analysis is\nvery simple thanks to a new \"target trick\" of independent interest. We\ncomplement these findings with a novel hardness result explaining why the\ninstance-dependent complexity of PAC RL cannot be easily related to that of\nregret minimization, unlike in the minimax regime.",

The\nproblems are illustrated with a real world example of a safety controller for\nautomated driving, and it is shown that the formulated conditions have the\nintended effect both for a faulty and a correct controller.

These complex and impactful decisions on children's\nlives rely on the judgment of child welfare decisionmakers.

This paper describes\na conceptual framework for ML to support child welfare decisions.

    "abstract": "We study a human-robot collaborative transportation task in presence of\nobstacles. The task for each agent is to carry a rigid object to a common\ntarget position, while safely avoiding obstacles and satisfying the compliance\nand actuation constraints of the other agent. Human and robot do not share the\nlocal view of the environment. The human policy either assists the robot when\nthey deem the robot actions safe based on their perception of the environment,\nor actively leads the task. Using estimated human inputs, the robot plans a\ntrajectory for the transported object by solving a constrained finite time\noptimal control problem. Sensors on the robot measure the inputs applied by the\nhuman.

This allows\nfor a dynamic leader-follower role adaptation of the robot throughout the task.\nFurthermore, under a low value of trust, if the robot approaches any obstacle\npotentially unknown to the human, it triggers a safe stopping policy,\nmaintaining safety of the system and signaling a required change in the human's\nintent.

We propose an end-to-end\nmachine learning based approach for topological ordering using an\nencoder-decoder framework. Our encoder is a novel attention based graph neural\nnetwork architecture called \\emph{Topoformer} which uses different topological\ntransforms of a DAG for message passing. The node embeddings produced by the\nencoder are converted into node priorities which are used by the decoder to\ngenerate a probability distribution over topological orders. We train our model\non a dataset of synthetically generated graphs called layered graphs. We show\nthat our model outperforms, or is on-par, with several topological ordering\nbaselines while being significantly faster on synthetic graphs with up to 2k\nnodes. We also train and test our model on a set of real-world computation\ngraphs, showing performance improvements.",

    "abstract": "It is known that deep neural networks (DNNs) classify an input image by\npaying particular attention to certain specific pixels; a graphical\nrepresentation of the magnitude of attention to each pixel is called a\nsaliency-map. Saliency-maps are used to check the validity of the\nclassification decision basis, e.g., it is not a valid basis for classification\nif a DNN pays more attention to the background rather than the subject of an\nimage. Semantic perturbations can significantly change the saliency-map. In\nthis work, we propose the first verification method for attention robustness,\ni.e., the local robustness of the changes in the saliency-map against\ncombinations of semantic perturbations. Specifically, our method determines the\nrange of the perturbation parameters (e.g., the brightness change) that\nmaintains the difference between the actual saliency-map change and the\nexpected saliency-map change below a given threshold value. Our method is based\non activation region traversals, focusing on the outermost robust boundary for\nscalability on larger DNNs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method\ncan show the extent to which DNNs can classify with the same basis regardless\nof semantic perturbations and report on performance and performance factors of\nactivation region traversals.",

    "abstract": "Existing keyframe-based motion synthesis mainly focuses on the generation of\ncyclic actions or short-term motion, such as walking, running, and transitions\nbetween close postures. However, these methods will significantly degrade the\nnaturalness and diversity of the synthesized motion when dealing with complex\nand impromptu movements, e.g., dance performance and martial arts. In addition,\ncurrent research lacks fine-grained control over the generated motion, which is\nessential for intelligent human-computer interaction and animation creation. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel keyframe-based motion generation network based\non multiple constraints, which can achieve diverse dance synthesis via learned\nknowledge. Specifically, the algorithm is mainly formulated based on the\nrecurrent neural network (RNN) and the Transformer architecture. The backbone\nof our network is a hierarchical RNN module composed of two long short-term\nmemory (LSTM) units, in which the first LSTM is utilized to embed the posture\ninformation of the historical frames into a latent space, and the second one is\nemployed to predict the human posture for the next frame. Moreover, our\nframework contains two Transformer-based controllers, which are used to model\nthe constraints of the root trajectory and the velocity factor respectively, so\nas to better utilize the temporal context of the frames and achieve\nfine-grained motion control. We verify the proposed approach on a dance dataset\ncontaining a wide range of contemporary dance. The results of three\nquantitative analyses validate the superiority of our algorithm. The video and\nqualitative experimental results demonstrate that the complex motion sequences\ngenerated by our algorithm can achieve diverse and smooth motion transitions\nbetween keyframes, even for long-term synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Inverse scattering involving microwave and ultrasound waves require numerical\nsolution of nonlinear optimization problem. To alleviate the computational\nburden of a full three-dimensional (3-D) inverse problem, it is a common\npractice to approximate the object as two-dimensional (2-D) and treat the\ntransmitter and receiver sensors as 3-D, through a Fourier integration of 2-D\nmodes of scattering. The resulting integral is singular, and hence requires a\nprohibitively large number of integration points, where each point corresponds\nto a 2-D solution. To reduce the computational complexity, this paper proposes\nfast integration approaches by a set of transformations. We model the object in\n2-D but the transmit and receiver pairs as 3-D; hence, we term the solution as\na 2.5-D inverse problem.

Moreover, appearance information,\nwhich is crucial for segmenting objects, is only used as post-process after the\nnetwork training process. To address these two issues, we propose a novel\nappearance-guided attentive self-paced learning framework for unsupervised\nsalient object detection. The proposed framework integrates both self-paced\nlearning (SPL) and appearance guidance into a unified learning framework.\nSpecifically, for the first issue, we propose an Attentive Self-Paced Learning\n(ASPL) paradigm that organizes the training samples in a meaningful order to\nexcavate gradually more detailed saliency information. Our ASPL facilitates our\nframework capable of automatically producing soft attention weights that\nmeasure the learning difficulty of training samples in a purely self-learning\nway. For the second issue, we propose an Appearance Guidance Module (AGM),\nwhich formulates the local appearance contrast of each pixel as the probability\nof saliency boundary and finds the potential boundary of the target objects by\nmaximizing the probability.

While it is well-understood that using\nmomentum can lead to faster convergence rate in various settings, it has also\nbeen observed that momentum yields higher generalization. Prior work argue that\nmomentum stabilizes the SGD noise during training and this leads to higher\ngeneralization. In this paper, we adopt another perspective and first\nempirically show that gradient descent with momentum (GD+M) significantly\nimproves generalization compared to gradient descent (GD) in some deep learning\nproblems. From this observation, we formally study how momentum improves\ngeneralization. We devise a binary classification setting where a one-hidden\nlayer (over-parameterized) convolutional neural network trained with GD+M\nprovably generalizes better than the same network trained with GD, when both\nalgorithms are similarly initialized. The key insight in our analysis is that\nmomentum is beneficial in datasets where the examples share some feature but\ndiffer in their margin. Contrary to GD that memorizes the small margin data,\nGD+M still learns the feature in these data thanks to its historical gradients.\nLastly, we empirically validate our theoretical findings.",

SCR transforms real-value features vector (e.g., 2048 float32)\nwith short binary codes (e.g., 64 bits) by first dividing real-value features\nvector into $M$ sub-spaces, each with $C$ clustered centroids. Thus the\ndistance between two samples can be expressed as the summation of the\nrespective distance to the centroids, which can be sped up by offline\ncalculation and maintained via a look-up table. On the other side, these\nreal-value centroids help to achieve significantly higher accuracy than using\nbinary code.

We characterize adversary capability in terms of the\nfraction of the input dataset that can be embedded with a Trojan trigger. We\nshow that the loss function has a submodular structure, which leads to the\ndesign of computationally efficient algorithms to determine this fraction with\nprovable bounds on optimality.

    "abstract": "It is important to understand how the popular regularization method dropout\nhelps the neural network training find a good generalization solution. In this\nwork, we theoretically derive the implicit regularization of dropout and study\nthe relation between the Hessian matrix of the loss function and the covariance\nmatrix of the dropout noise, supported by a series of experiments. We then\nnumerically study two implications of the implicit regularization of dropout,\nwhich intuitively rationalize why dropout helps generalization. First, we find\nthat the training with dropout finds the neural network with a flatter minimum\ncompared with standard gradient descent training in experiments, and the\nimplicit regularization is the key for finding flat solutions. Second, trained\nwith dropout, input weights of hidden neurons (the input weight of a hidden\nneuron consists of the weight from its input layer to the hidden neuron and its\nbias term) would tend to condense on isolated orientations. Condensation is a\nfeature in non-linear learning process, which makes the neural network low\ncomplexity. Although our theory mainly focuses on the dropout used in the last\nhidden layer, our experiments apply for general dropout in training neural\nnetworks. This work points out the distinct characteristics of dropout compared\nwith stochastic gradient descent and serves as an important basis for fully\nunderstanding dropout.",

Most of the existing OSR methods are\ninductive methods, which generally suffer from the domain shift problem that\nthe learned model from the known-class domain might be unsuitable for the\nunknown-class domain. Addressing this problem, inspired by the success of\ntransductive learning for alleviating the domain shift problem in many other\nvisual tasks, we propose an Iterative Transductive OSR framework, called\nIT-OSR, which implements three explored modules iteratively, including a\nreliability sampling module, a feature generation module, and a baseline update\nmodule. Specifically, at each iteration, a dual-space consistent sampling\napproach is presented in the explored reliability sampling module for selecting\nsome relatively more reliable ones from the test samples according to their\npseudo labels assigned by a baseline method, which could be an arbitrary\ninductive OSR method. Then, a conditional dual-adversarial generative network\nunder an orthogonal coding condition is designed in the feature generation\nmodule to generate discriminative sample features of both known and unknown\nclasses according to the selected test samples with their pseudo labels.\nFinally, the baseline method is updated for sample re-prediction in the\nbaseline update module by jointly utilizing the generated features, the\nselected test samples with pseudo labels, and the training samples. Extensive\nexperimental results on both the standard-dataset and the cross-dataset\nsettings demonstrate that the derived transductive methods, by introducing two\ntypical inductive OSR methods into the proposed IT-OSR framework, achieve\nbetter performances than 15 state-of-the-art methods in most cases.",

Linear autoencoder is a kind of well-established method for CF, which\nestimates item-item relations through encoding user-item interactions. Despite\nthe excellent performance of linear autoencoders, the rapidly increasing\ncomputational and storage costs caused by the growing number of items limit\ntheir scalabilities in large-scale real-world scenarios. Recently, graph-based\napproaches have achieved success on CF with high scalability, and have been\nshown to have commonalities with linear autoencoders in user-item interaction\nmodeling. Motivated by this, we propose an efficient and scalable\nrecommendation via item-item graph partitioning (ERGP), aiming to address the\nlimitations of linear autoencoders. In particular, a recursive graph\npartitioning strategy is proposed to ensure that the item set is divided into\nseveral partitions of finite size. Linear autoencoders encode user-item\ninteractions within partitions while preserving global information across the\nentire item set. This allows ERGP to have guaranteed efficiency and high\nscalability when the number of items increases.

    "abstract": "This paper studies the multi-modal recommendation problem, where the item\nmulti-modality information (eg. images and textual descriptions) is exploited\nto improve the recommendation accuracy. Besides the user-item interaction\ngraph, existing state-of-the-art methods usually use auxiliary graphs (eg.\nuser-user or item-item relation graph) to augment the learned representations\nof users and/or items. These representations are often propagated and\naggregated on auxiliary graphs using graph convolutional networks, which can be\nprohibitively expensive in computation and memory, especially for large graphs.\nMoreover, existing multi-modal recommendation methods usually leverage randomly\nsampled negative examples in Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) loss to guide\nthe learning of user/item representations, which increases the computational\ncost on large graphs and may also bring noisy supervision signals into the\ntraining process. To tackle the above issues, we propose a novel\nself-supervised multi-modal recommendation model, dubbed BM3, which requires\nneither augmentations from auxiliary graphs nor negative samples. Specifically,\nBM3 first bootstraps latent contrastive views from the representations of users\nand items with a simple dropout augmentation. It then jointly optimizes three\nmulti-modal objectives to learn the representations of users and items by\nreconstructing the user-item interaction graph and aligning modality features\nunder both inter- and intra-modality perspectives. BM3 alleviates both the need\nfor contrasting with negative examples and the complex graph augmentation from\nan additional target network for contrastive view generation. We show BM3\noutperforms prior recommendation models on three datasets with number of nodes\nranging from 20K to 200K, while achieving a 2-9X reduction in training time.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/enoche/BM3.",

DApp-supported blockchains like Ethereum have largely been responsible\nfor this drive supporting the largest eco-system of DApps. Although the low\nperformance provided by Ethereum has been a major impediment to realizing a\ndecentralized web, several high-performance blockchains have been introduced\nrecently to bridge this gap.

We empirically show the performance improvements gained by our\nenhanced transaction management in the Smart Red Belly Blockchain (SRBB) VM we\ndevelop.

Much of traditional caching research\nstudies cache management for a single-user or single-processor environment. In\nthis paper, we propose two related generalizations of the classical caching\nproblem that capture issues that arise in a multi-user or multi-processor\nenvironment. In the caching with reserves problem, a caching algorithm is\nrequired to maintain at least $k_i$ pages belonging to user $i$ in the cache at\nany time, for some given reserve capacities $k_i$. In the public-private\ncaching problem, the cache of total size $k$ is partitioned into subcaches, a\nprivate cache of size $k_i$ for each user $i$ and a shared public cache usable\nby any user. In both of these models, as in the classical caching framework,\nthe objective of the algorithm is to dynamically maintain the cache so as to\nminimize the total number of cache misses.\nWe show that caching with reserves and public-private caching models are\nequivalent up to constant factors, and thus focus on the former. Unlike\nclassical caching, both of these models turn out to be NP-hard even in the\noffline setting, where the page sequence is known in advance. For the offline\nsetting, we design a 2-approximation algorithm, whose analysis carefully keeps\ntrack of a potential function to bound the cost. In the online setting, we\nfirst design an $O(\\ln k)$-competitive fractional algorithm using the\nprimal-dual framework, and then show how to convert it online to a randomized\nintegral algorithm with the same guarantee.",

On the one hand, good updates sent by honest participants may reveal\ntheir private local information, whereas poisoned updates sent by malicious\nparticipants may compromise the model's availability and/or integrity. On the\nother hand, enhancing privacy via update distortion damages accuracy, whereas\ndoing so via update aggregation damages security because it does not allow the\nserver to filter out individual poisoned updates. To tackle the\naccuracy-privacy-security conflict, we propose {\\em fragmented federated\nlearning} (FFL), in which participants randomly exchange and mix fragments of\ntheir updates before sending them to the server. To achieve privacy, we design\na lightweight protocol that allows participants to privately exchange and mix\nencrypted fragments of their updates so that the server can neither obtain\nindividual updates nor link them to their originators. To achieve security, we\ndesign a reputation-based defense tailored for FFL that builds trust in\nparticipants and their mixed updates based on the quality of the fragments they\nexchange and the mixed updates they send. Since the exchanged fragments'\nparameters keep their original coordinates and attackers can be neutralized,\nthe server can correctly reconstruct a global model from the received mixed\nupdates without accuracy loss.

Using a round-robin tournament on the\nBTTT environment, we show that traditional RL state-search approaches such as\nMonte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and Minimax are more generalizable to novel test\nenvironments than AlphaZero is. This is surprising because AlphaZero has been\nshown to achieve superhuman performance in environments such as Go, Chess and\nShogi, which may lead one to think that it performs well in novel test\nenvironments. Our results show that BTTT, though simple, is rich enough to\nexplore the generalizability of AlphaZero. We find that merely increasing MCTS\nlookahead iterations was insufficient for AlphaZero to generalize to some novel\ntest environments. Rather, increasing the variety of training environments\nhelps to progressively improve generalizability across all possible starting\nbrick configurations.",

    "abstract": "The Houma Alliance Book is one of the national treasures of the Museum in\nShanxi Museum Town in China. It has great historical significance in\nresearching ancient history. To date, the research on the Houma Alliance Book\nhas been staying in the identification of paper documents, which is inefficient\nto identify and difficult to display, study and publicize. Therefore, the\ndigitization of the recognized ancient characters of Houma League can\neffectively improve the efficiency of recognizing ancient characters and\nprovide more reliable technical support and text data. This paper proposes a\nnew database of Houma Alliance Book ancient handwritten characters and a\nmulti-modal fusion method to recognize ancient handwritten characters. In the\ndatabase, 297 classes and 3,547 samples of Houma Alliance ancient handwritten\ncharacters are collected from the original book collection and by human\nimitative writing. Furthermore, the decision-level classifier fusion strategy\nis applied to fuse three well-known deep neural network architectures for\nancient handwritten character recognition. Experiments are performed on our new\ndatabase. The experimental results first provide the baseline result of the new\ndatabase to the research community and then demonstrate the efficiency of our\nproposed method.",

To this end, we propose Visual Context-driven Audio\nFeature Enhancement module (V-CAFE) to enhance the input noisy audio speech\nwith a help of audio-visual correspondence. The proposed V-CAFE is designed to\ncapture the transition of lip movements, namely visual context and to generate\na noise reduction mask by considering the obtained visual context. Through\ncontext-dependent modeling, the ambiguity in viseme-to-phoneme mapping can be\nrefined for mask generation.

The enhanced audio\nfeatures are fused with the visual features and taken to an encoder-decoder\nmodel composed of Conformer and Transformer for speech recognition. We show the\nproposed end-to-end AVSR with the V-CAFE can further improve the\nnoise-robustness of AVSR.

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based face recognition models are vulnerable to adversarial\nattacks. To curb these attacks, most defense methods aim to improve the\nrobustness of recognition models against adversarial perturbations. However,\nthe generalization capacities of these methods are quite limited. In practice,\nthey are still vulnerable to unseen adversarial attacks. Deep learning models\nare fairly robust to general perturbations, such as Gaussian noises. A\nstraightforward approach is to inactivate the adversarial perturbations so that\nthey can be easily handled as general perturbations. In this paper, a\nplug-and-play adversarial defense method, named perturbation inactivation\n(PIN), is proposed to inactivate adversarial perturbations for adversarial\ndefense. We discover that the perturbations in different subspaces have\ndifferent influences on the recognition model. There should be a subspace,\ncalled the immune space, in which the perturbations have fewer adverse impacts\non the recognition model than in other subspaces. Hence, our method estimates\nthe immune space and inactivates the adversarial perturbations by restricting\nthem to this subspace. The proposed method can be generalized to unseen\nadversarial perturbations since it does not rely on a specific kind of\nadversarial attack method. This approach not only outperforms several\nstate-of-the-art adversarial defense methods but also demonstrates a superior\ngeneralization capacity through exhaustive experiments. Moreover, the proposed\nmethod can be successfully applied to four commercial APIs without additional\ntraining, indicating that it can be easily generalized to existing face\nrecognition systems.

    "abstract": "Great progress has been achieved in the community of autonomous driving in\nthe past few years. As a safety-critical problem, however, anomaly detection is\na huge hurdle towards a large-scale deployment of autonomous vehicles in the\nreal world. While many approaches, such as uncertainty estimation or\nsegmentation-based image resynthesis, are extremely promising, there is more to\nbe explored. Especially inspired by works on anomaly detection based on image\nresynthesis, we propose a novel approach for anomaly detection through style\ntransfer. We leverage generative models to map an image from its original style\ndomain of road traffic to an arbitrary one and back to generate pixelwise\nanomaly scores. However, our experiments have proven our hypothesis wrong, and\nwe were unable to produce significant results. Nevertheless, we want to share\nour findings, so that others can learn from our experiments.",

    "abstract": "Voice conversion is to generate a new speech with the source content and a\ntarget voice style. In this paper, we focus on one general setting, i.e.,\nnon-parallel many-to-many voice conversion, which is close to the real-world\nscenario. As the name implies, non-parallel many-to-many voice conversion does\nnot require the paired source and reference speeches and can be applied to\narbitrary voice transfer. In recent years, Generative Adversarial Networks\n(GANs) and other techniques such as Conditional Variational Autoencoders\n(CVAEs) have made considerable progress in this field. However, due to the\nsophistication of voice conversion, the style similarity of the converted\nspeech is still unsatisfactory. Inspired by the inherent structure of\nmel-spectrogram, we propose a new voice conversion framework, i.e.,\nSubband-based Generative Adversarial Network for Voice Conversion (SGAN-VC).\nSGAN-VC converts each subband content of the source speech separately by\nexplicitly utilizing the spatial characteristics between different subbands.\nSGAN-VC contains one style encoder, one content encoder, and one decoder. In\nparticular, the style encoder network is designed to learn style codes for\ndifferent subbands of the target speaker. The content encoder network can\ncapture the content information on the source speech. Finally, the decoder\ngenerates particular subband content. In addition, we propose a pitch-shift\nmodule to fine-tune the pitch of the source speaker, making the converted tone\nmore accurate and explainable. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the\nproposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on VCTK Corpus and\nAISHELL3 datasets both qualitatively and quantitatively, whether on seen or\nunseen data. Furthermore, the content intelligibility of SGAN-VC on unseen data\neven exceeds that of StarGANv2-VC with ASR network assistance.",

Prior work addresses this issue by\nusing ad-hoc approaches, e.g., bounding the internal dynamics using specific\nactivation functions, but the resulting models do not satisfy the exact\nheavy-ball ODE. In this work, we propose adaptive momentum estimation neural\nODEs (AdamNODEs) that adaptively control the acceleration of the classical\nmomentum-based approach. We find that its adjoint states also satisfy AdamODE\nand do not require ad-hoc solutions that the prior work employs. In evaluation,\nwe show that AdamNODEs achieve the lowest training loss and efficacy over\nexisting neural ODEs. We also show that AdamNODEs have better training\nstability than classical momentum-based neural ODEs.

Recently, novel Transformer-based models\nhave achieved encouraging results for various computer vision tasks. We still\nobserved that vanilla ViT could not yield satisfactory results in traffic sign\ndetection because the overall size of the datasets is very small and the class\ndistribution of traffic signs is extremely unbalanced. To overcome this\nproblem, a novel Pyramid Transformer with locality mechanisms is proposed in\nthis paper. Specifically, Pyramid Transformer has several spatial pyramid\nreduction layers to shrink and embed the input image into tokens with rich\nmulti-scale context by using atrous convolutions. Moreover, it inherits an\nintrinsic scale invariance inductive bias and is able to learn local feature\nrepresentation for objects at various scales, thereby enhancing the network\nrobustness against the size discrepancy of traffic signs. The experiments are\nconducted on the German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark (GTSDB). The results\ndemonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in the traffic sign detection\ntasks.

The well-known sequential algorithm of\nKnuth solves this problem in $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^2\\right)$ time and space,\nwhere $n$ is the number of keys used to build the optimal binary search tree.\nTo parallelize this algorithm on the CGM model, the irregular partitioning\ntechnique, consisting in subdividing the dependency graph into subgraphs (or\nblocks) of variable size, has been proposed to tackle the trade-off of\nminimizing the number of communication rounds and balancing the load of\nprocessors. This technique however induces a high latency time of processors\n(which accounts for most of the global communication time) because varying the\nblocks' sizes does not enable them to start evaluating some blocks as soon as\nthe data they need are available. The four-splitting technique proposed in this\npaper solves this shortcoming by evaluating a block as a sequence of\ncomputation and communication steps of four subblocks. This CGM-based parallel\nsolution requires $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^2/\\sqrt{p} \\right)$ execution time with\n$\\mathcal{O}\\left( k \\sqrt{p}\\right)$ communication rounds, where $p$ is the\nnumber of processors and $k$ is the number of times the size of blocks is\nsubdivided.

ML models inform\ndecisions in criminal justice, the extension of credit in banking, and the\nhiring practices of corporations. This posits the requirement of model\nfairness, which holds that automated decisions should be equitable with respect\nto protected features (e.g., gender, race, or age) that are often\nunder-represented in the data. We postulate that this problem of\nunder-representation has a corollary to the problem of imbalanced data\nlearning. This class imbalance is often reflected in both classes and protected\nfeatures. For example, one class (those receiving credit) may be\nover-represented with respect to another class (those not receiving credit) and\na particular group (females) may be under-represented with respect to another\ngroup (males). A key element in achieving algorithmic fairness with respect to\nprotected groups is the simultaneous reduction of class and protected group\nimbalance in the underlying training data, which facilitates increases in both\nmodel accuracy and fairness. We discuss the importance of bridging imbalanced\nlearning and group fairness by showing how key concepts in these fields overlap\nand complement each other; and propose a novel oversampling algorithm, Fair\nOversampling, that addresses both skewed class distributions and protected\nfeatures. Our method: (i) can be used as an efficient pre-processing algorithm\nfor standard ML algorithms to jointly address imbalance and group equity; and\n(ii) can be combined with fairness-aware learning algorithms to improve their\nrobustness to varying levels of class imbalance.

These star\nproduct PIR schemes with colluding servers are suitable for the storage of\nfiles over small fields and can be constructed for coded distributed storage\nsystem with large number of servers. In this paper for an efficient storage\ncode, the problem to find good retrieval codes is considered. In general if the\nstorage code is a binary Reed-Muller code the retrieval code needs not to be a\nbinary Reed-Muller code in general. It is proved that when the storage code\ncontains some special codewords, nonzero retrieval rate star product PIR\nschemes with colluding servers can only protect against small number of\ncolluding servers. We also give examples to show that when the storage code is\na good cyclic code, the best choice of the retrieval code is not cyclic in\ngeneral.

    "title": "Introducing $\u03b3$-lifting for Learning Nonlinear Pulse Shaping in  Coherent Optical Communication",
    "abstract": "Pulse shaping for coherent optical fiber communication has been an active\narea of research for the past decade. Most of the early schemes are based on\nclassic Nyquist pulse shaping that was originally intended for linear channels.\nThe best known classic scheme, the split digital back-propagation (DBP), uses\njoint pre-distortion and post equalization and hence, a nonlinear transmitter\n(TX); it, however, suffers from spectral broadening on the fiber due to the\nKerr-effect. With the advent of deep learning in communications, it has been\nrealized that an Autoencoder can learn to communicate efficiently over the\noptical fiber channel, jointly optimizing geometric constellations and pulse\nshaping - while also taking into account linear and nonlinear impairments such\nas chromatic dispersion and Kerr-nonlinearity. E.g., arXiv:2006.15027 shows how\nan Autoencoder can learn to mitigate spectral broadening due to the Kerr-effect\nusing a trainable linear TX. In this paper, we extend this linear architectural\ntemplate to a scalable nonlinear pulse shaping consisting of a Convolutional\nNeural Network at both transmitter and receiver. By introducing a novel\n$\\gamma$-lifting training procedure tailored to the nonlinear optical fiber\nchannel, we achieve stable Autoencoder convergence to pulse shapes reaching\ninformation rates outperforming the classic split DBP reference at high input\npowers.",

    "title": "Eliminating Gradient Conflict in Reference-based Line-art Colorization",
    "abstract": "Reference-based line-art colorization is a challenging task in computer\nvision. The color, texture, and shading are rendered based on an abstract\nsketch, which heavily relies on the precise long-range dependency modeling\nbetween the sketch and reference. Popular techniques to bridge the cross-modal\ninformation and model the long-range dependency employ the attention mechanism.\nHowever, in the context of reference-based line-art colorization, several\ntechniques would intensify the existing training difficulty of attention, for\ninstance, self-supervised training protocol and GAN-based losses. To understand\nthe instability in training, we detect the gradient flow of attention and\nobserve gradient conflict among attention branches. This phenomenon motivates\nus to alleviate the gradient issue by preserving the dominant gradient branch\nwhile removing the conflict ones. We propose a novel attention mechanism using\nthis training strategy, Stop-Gradient Attention (SGA), outperforming the\nattention baseline by a large margin with better training stability. Compared\nwith state-of-the-art modules in line-art colorization, our approach\ndemonstrates significant improvements in Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID, up\nto 27.21%) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM, up to 25.67%) on\nseveral benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Objective: Machine learning techniques have been used extensively for 12-lead\nelectrocardiogram (ECG) analysis. For physiological time series, deep learning\n(DL) superiority to feature engineering (FE) approaches based on domain\nknowledge is still an open question. Moreover, it remains unclear whether\ncombining DL with FE may improve performance. Methods: We considered three\ntasks intending to address these research gaps: cardiac arrhythmia diagnosis\n(multiclass-multilabel classification), atrial fibrillation risk prediction\n(binary classification), and age estimation (regression). We used an overall\ndataset of 2.3M 12-lead ECG recordings to train the following models for each\ntask: i) a random forest taking the FE as input was trained as a classical\nmachine learning approach; ii) an end-to-end DL model; and iii) a merged model\nof FE+DL. Results: FE yielded comparable results to DL while necessitating\nsignificantly less data for the two classification tasks and it was\noutperformed by DL for the regression task. For all tasks, merging FE with DL\ndid not improve performance over DL alone. Conclusion: We found that for\ntraditional 12-lead ECG based diagnosis tasks DL did not yield a meaningful\nimprovement over FE, while it improved significantly the nontraditional\nregression task. We also found that combining FE with DL did not improve over\nDL alone which suggests that the FE were redundant with the features learned by\nDL. Significance: Our findings provides important recommendations on what\nmachine learning strategy and data regime to chose with respect to the task at\nhand for the development of new machine learning models based on the 12-lead\nECG.",

The consequences are biased benchmarks and in extreme cases also\nperformance degradation of deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on such\ndatasets. DNNs for semantic segmentation yield pixel-wise predictions, which\nmakes detection of label errors via uncertainty quantification a complex task.\nUncertainty is particularly pronounced at the transitions between connected\ncomponents of the prediction. By lifting the consideration of uncertainty to\nthe level of predicted components, we enable the usage of DNNs together with\ncomponent-level uncertainty quantification for the detection of label errors.\nWe present a principled approach to benchmarking the task of label error\ndetection by dropping labels from the Cityscapes dataset as well from a dataset\nextracted from the CARLA driving simulator, where in the latter case we have\nthe labels under control. Our experiments show that our approach is able to\ndetect the vast majority of label errors while controlling the number of false\nlabel error detections.

Prior approaches,\ndespite the promising results, have relied on either estimating dense attention\nto compute per-point matching, which is limited to only coarse scales due to\nthe quadratic memory cost, or fixing the number of correspondences to achieve\nlinear complexity, which lacks flexibility. In this paper, we propose a dynamic\nsparse attention based Transformer model, termed Dynamic Sparse Transformer\n(DynaST), to achieve fine-level matching with favorable efficiency. The heart\nof our approach is a novel dynamic-attention unit, dedicated to covering the\nvariation on the optimal number of tokens one position should focus on.\nSpecifically, DynaST leverages the multi-layer nature of Transformer structure,\nand performs the dynamic attention scheme in a cascaded manner to refine\nmatching results and synthesize visually-pleasing outputs. In addition, we\nintroduce a unified training objective for DynaST, making it a versatile\nreference-based image translation framework for both supervised and\nunsupervised scenarios. Extensive experiments on three applications,\npose-guided person image generation, edge-based face synthesis, and undistorted\nimage style transfer, demonstrate that DynaST achieves superior performance in\nlocal details, outperforming the state of the art while reducing the\ncomputational cost significantly.

In this paper, we propose the use of\ncontinual meta-RL as a means to transfer information from previously\nexperienced traffic configurations to new conditions, with the goal of reducing\nthe time needed to optimize the UABS's policy. Adopting the Continual Meta\nPolicy Search (CoMPS) strategy, we demonstrate significant efficiency gains as\ncompared to conventional RL, as well as to naive transfer learning methods.",

Using the single-layer\npotential representations on two measurement curves, this co-inversion problem\ncan be decoupled into two inverse problems: an inverse cavity scattering\nproblem and an inverse source problem. This novel decoupling technique is fast\nand easy to implement since it is based on a linear system of integral\nequations. Then the uncoupled subproblems are respectively solved by the\nmodified optimization and sampling method. We also establish the uniqueness of\nthis co-inversion problem and analyze the stability of our method.

    "abstract": "Depth estimation is one of the key technologies in some fields such as\nautonomous driving and robot navigation. However, the traditional method of\nusing a single sensor is inevitably limited by the performance of the sensor.\nTherefore, a precision and robust method for fusing the LiDAR and stereo\ncameras is proposed. This method fully combines the advantages of the LiDAR and\nstereo camera, which can retain the advantages of the high precision of the\nLiDAR and the high resolution of images respectively. Compared with the\ntraditional stereo matching method, the texture of the object and lighting\nconditions have less influence on the algorithm. Firstly, the depth of the\nLiDAR data is converted to the disparity of the stereo camera. Because the\ndensity of the LiDAR data is relatively sparse on the y-axis, the converted\ndisparity map is up-sampled using the interpolation method. Secondly, in order\nto make full use of the precise disparity map, the disparity map and stereo\nmatching are fused to propagate the accurate disparity. Finally, the disparity\nmap is converted to the depth map. Moreover, the converted disparity map can\nalso increase the speed of the algorithm. We evaluate the proposed pipeline on\nthe KITTI benchmark. The experiment demonstrates that our algorithm has higher\naccuracy than several classic methods.",

    "abstract": "Vulnerability to adversarial attacks is one of the principal hurdles to the\nadoption of deep learning in safety-critical applications. Despite significant\nefforts, both practical and theoretical, training deep learning models robust\nto adversarial attacks is still an open problem. In this paper, we analyse the\ngeometry of adversarial attacks in the large-data, overparameterized limit for\nBayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). We show that, in the limit, vulnerability to\ngradient-based attacks arises as a result of degeneracy in the data\ndistribution, i.e., when the data lies on a lower-dimensional submanifold of\nthe ambient space. As a direct consequence, we demonstrate that in this limit\nBNN posteriors are robust to gradient-based adversarial attacks. Crucially, we\nprove that the expected gradient of the loss with respect to the BNN posterior\ndistribution is vanishing, even when each neural network sampled from the\nposterior is vulnerable to gradient-based attacks. Experimental results on the\nMNIST, Fashion MNIST, and half moons datasets, representing the finite data\nregime, with BNNs trained with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Variational\nInference, support this line of arguments, showing that BNNs can display both\nhigh accuracy on clean data and robustness to both gradient-based and\ngradient-free based adversarial attacks.",

Two mainstream unsupervised learning\nschemes are the instance-level contrastive framework and clustering-based\nschemes. The former adopts the extremely fine-grained instance-level\ndiscrimination whose supervisory signal is not efficient due to the false\nnegatives. Though the latter solves this, they commonly come with some\nrestrictions affecting the performance. To integrate their advantages, we\ndesign the SMoG method. SMoG follows the framework of contrastive learning but\nreplaces the contrastive unit from instance to group, mimicking\nclustering-based methods. To achieve this, we propose the momentum grouping\nscheme which synchronously conducts feature grouping with representation\nlearning. In this way, SMoG solves the problem of supervisory signal hysteresis\nwhich the clustering-based method usually faces, and reduces the false\nnegatives of instance contrastive methods. We conduct exhaustive experiments to\nshow that SMoG works well on both CNN and Transformer backbones. Results prove\nthat SMoG has surpassed the current SOTA unsupervised representation learning\nmethods.

The appropriate CCTA Vessel-level Image Quality\nAssessment (CCTA VIQA) algorithm can be used to reduce the risk of error\ndiagnosis. The primary challenges of CCTA VIQA are that the local part of\ncoronary that determines final quality is hard to locate. To tackle the\nchallenge, we formulate CCTA VIQA as a multiple-instance learning (MIL)\nproblem, and exploit Transformer-based MIL backbone (termed as T-MIL) to\naggregate the multiple instances along the coronary centerline into the final\nquality. However, not all instances are informative for final quality.

Therefore, we propose a Progressive\nReinforcement learning based Instance Discarding module (termed as PRID) to\nprogressively remove quality-irrelevant/negative instances for CCTA VIQA.

    "abstract": "Machine learning has proved useful in many software disciplines, including\ncomputer vision, speech and audio processing, natural language processing,\nrobotics and some other fields. However, its applicability has been\nsignificantly hampered due its black-box nature and significant resource\nconsumption. Performance is achieved at the expense of enormous computational\nresource and usually compromising the robustness and trustworthiness of the\nmodel. Recent researches have been identifying a lack of interactivity as the\nprime source of these machine learning problems. Consequently, interactive\nmachine learning (iML) has acquired increased attention of researchers on\naccount of its human-in-the-loop modality and relatively efficient resource\nutilization. Thereby, a state-of-the-art review of interactive machine learning\nplays a vital role in easing the effort toward building human-centred models.\nIn this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the state-of-the-art of\niML. We analyze salient research works using merit-oriented and\napplication/task oriented mixed taxonomy. We use a bottom-up clustering\napproach to generate a taxonomy of iML research works. Research works on\nadversarial black-box attacks and corresponding iML based defense system,\nexploratory machine learning, resource constrained learning, and iML\nperformance evaluation are analyzed under their corresponding theme in our\nmerit-oriented taxonomy. We have further classified these research works into\ntechnical and sectoral categories. Finally, research opportunities that we\nbelieve are inspiring for future work in iML are discussed thoroughly.",

    "abstract": "Object detection, as a fundamental computer vision task, has achieved a\nremarkable progress with the emergence of deep neural networks. Nevertheless,\nfew works explore the adversarial robustness of object detectors to resist\nadversarial attacks for practical applications in various real-world scenarios.\nDetectors have been greatly challenged by unnoticeable perturbation, with sharp\nperformance drop on clean images and extremely poor performance on adversarial\nimages. In this work, we empirically explore the model training for adversarial\nrobustness in object detection, which greatly attributes to the conflict\nbetween learning clean images and adversarial images. To mitigate this issue,\nwe propose a Robust Detector (RobustDet) based on adversarially-aware\nconvolution to disentangle gradients for model learning on clean and\nadversarial images. RobustDet also employs the Adversarial Image Discriminator\n(AID) and Consistent Features with Reconstruction (CFR) to ensure a reliable\nrobustness. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO demonstrate that\nour model effectively disentangles gradients and significantly enhances the\ndetection robustness with maintaining the detection ability on clean images.",

    "abstract": "Humans have an innate ability to sense their surroundings, as they can\nextract the spatial representation from the egocentric perception and form an\nallocentric semantic map via spatial transformation and memory updating.\nHowever, endowing mobile agents with such a spatial sensing ability is still a\nchallenge, due to two difficulties: (1) the previous convolutional models are\nlimited by the local receptive field, thus, struggling to capture holistic\nlong-range dependencies during observation; (2) the excessive computational\nbudgets required for success, often lead to a separation of the mapping\npipeline into stages, resulting the entire mapping process inefficient. To\naddress these issues, we propose an end-to-end one-stage Transformer-based\nframework for Mapping, termed Trans4Map. Our egocentric-to-allocentric mapping\nprocess includes three steps: (1) the efficient transformer extracts the\ncontextual features from a batch of egocentric images; (2) the proposed\nBidirectional Allocentric Memory (BAM) module projects egocentric features into\nthe allocentric memory; (3) the map decoder parses the accumulated memory and\npredicts the top-down semantic segmentation map. In contrast, Trans4Map\nachieves state-of-the-art results, reducing 67.2% parameters, yet gaining a\n+3.25% mIoU and a +4.09% mBF1 improvements on the Matterport3D dataset.

    "abstract": "It is now well known that neural networks can be wrong with high confidence\nin their predictions, leading to poor calibration. The most common post-hoc\napproach to compensate for this is to perform temperature scaling, which\nadjusts the confidences of the predictions on any input by scaling the logits\nby a fixed value. Whilst this approach typically improves the average\ncalibration across the whole test dataset, this improvement typically reduces\nthe individual confidences of the predictions irrespective of whether the\nclassification of a given input is correct or incorrect. With this insight, we\nbase our method on the observation that different samples contribute to the\ncalibration error by varying amounts, with some needing to increase their\nconfidence and others needing to decrease it. Therefore, for each input, we\npropose to predict a different temperature value, allowing us to adjust the\nmismatch between confidence and accuracy at a finer granularity. Furthermore,\nwe observe improved results on OOD detection and can also extract a notion of\nhardness for the data-points. Our method is applied post-hoc, consequently\nusing very little computation time and with a negligible memory footprint and\nis applied to off-the-shelf pre-trained classifiers. We test our method on the\nResNet50 and WideResNet28-10 architectures using the CIFAR10/100 and\nTiny-ImageNet datasets, showing that producing per-data-point temperatures is\nbeneficial also for the expected calibration error across the whole test set.\nCode is available at: https://github.com/thwjoy/adats.",

This question can be formally stated as a\nproperty of the centrality measure that defines the importance of the actors of\nthe network. Score monotonicity means that adding an arc increases the\ncentrality score of the target of the arc; rank monotonicity means that adding\nan arc improves the importance of the target of the arc relatively to the\nremaining nodes. It is known that most centralities are both score and rank\nmonotone on directed, strongly connected graphs. In this paper, we study the\nproblem of score and rank monotonicity for classical centrality measures in the\ncase of undirected networks: in this case, we require that score, or relative\nimportance, improve at both endpoints of the new edge. We show that,\nsurprisingly, the situation in the undirected case is very different, and in\nparticular that closeness, harmonic centrality, betweenness, eigenvector\ncentrality, Seeley's index, Katz's index, and PageRank are not rank monotone;\nbetweenness and PageRank are not even score monotone.

There are millions of articles\navailable online and thousands of new articles are released each month. For\nthis reason, finding relevant sources is a difficult task: many claims do not\nhave any references that support them. Furthermore, even existing citations\nmight not support a given claim or become obsolete once the original source is\nupdated or deleted. Hence, maintaining and improving the quality of Wikipedia\nreferences is an important challenge and there is a pressing need for better\ntools to assist humans in this effort.

    "abstract": "Abstract knowledge is deeply grounded in many computer-based applications. An\nimportant research area of Artificial Intelligence (AI) deals with the\nautomatic derivation of knowledge from data. Machine learning offers the\naccording algorithms. One area of research focuses on the development of\nbiologically inspired learning algorithms. The respective machine learning\nmethods are based on neurological concepts so that they can systematically\nderive knowledge from data and store it. One type of machine learning\nalgorithms that can be categorized as \"deep learning\" model is referred to as\nDeep Neural Networks (DNNs). DNNs consist of multiple artificial neurons\narranged in layers that are trained by using the backpropagation algorithm.\nThese deep learning methods exhibit amazing capabilities for inferring and\nstoring complex knowledge from high-dimensional data. However, DNNs are\naffected by a problem that prevents new knowledge from being added to an\nexisting base. The ability to continuously accumulate knowledge is an important\nfactor that contributed to evolution and is therefore a prerequisite for the\ndevelopment of strong AIs. The so-called \"catastrophic forgetting\" (CF) effect\ncauses DNNs to immediately loose already derived knowledge after a few training\niterations on a new data distribution. Only an energetically expensive\nretraining with the joint data distribution of past and new data enables the\nabstraction of the entire new set of knowledge. In order to counteract the\neffect, various techniques have been and are still being developed with the\ngoal to mitigate or even solve the CF problem. These published CF avoidance\nstudies usually imply the effectiveness of their approaches for various\ncontinual learning tasks.

To represent\nthe analysis unit of the SNA, this paper only considers the degree of a vertex,\nwhere it is the core of all the analysis in the SNA and it is basic for\ndefining the relation between resources and SNA in SNM.

Here we investigate the tasks\nof inferring and predicting participant behavior, in terms of motion paths and\nactions, under such conditions. We narrow the problem to that of estimating how\na set target participants react to the behavior of other observed participants.\nOur key idea is to model the spatio-temporal relations among participants in a\nmanner that is robust to error accumulation during frame-wise inference and\nprediction. We propose a novel Entry-Flipped Transformer (EF-Transformer),\nwhich models the relations of participants by attention mechanisms on both\nspatial and temporal domains. Unlike typical transformers, we tackle the\nproblem of error accumulation by flipping the order of query, key, and value\nentries, to increase the importance and fidelity of observed features in the\ncurrent frame. Comparative experiments show that our EF-Transformer achieves\nthe best performance on a newly-collected tennis doubles dataset, a Ceilidh\ndance dataset, and two pedestrian datasets. Furthermore, it is also\ndemonstrated that our EF-Transformer is better at limiting accumulated errors\nand recovering from wrong estimations.",

    "abstract": "The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to\ncybersecurity challenges has gained traction in industry and academia,\npartially as a result of widespread malware attacks on critical systems such as\ncloud infrastructures and government institutions. Intrusion Detection Systems\n(IDS), using some forms of AI, have received widespread adoption due to their\nability to handle vast amounts of data with a high prediction accuracy. These\nsystems are hosted in the organizational Cyber Security Operation Center (CSoC)\nas a defense tool to monitor and detect malicious network flow that would\notherwise impact the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA). CSoC\nanalysts rely on these systems to make decisions about the detected threats.\nHowever, IDSs designed using Deep Learning (DL) techniques are often treated as\nblack box models and do not provide a justification for their predictions. This\ncreates a barrier for CSoC analysts, as they are unable to improve their\ndecisions based on the model's predictions. One solution to this problem is to\ndesign explainable IDS (X-IDS).\nThis survey reviews the state-of-the-art in explainable AI (XAI) for IDS, its\ncurrent challenges, and discusses how these challenges span to the design of an\nX-IDS. In particular, we discuss black box and white box approaches\ncomprehensively. We also present the tradeoff between these approaches in terms\nof their performance and ability to produce explanations. Furthermore, we\npropose a generic architecture that considers human-in-the-loop which can be\nused as a guideline when designing an X-IDS. Research recommendations are given\nfrom three critical viewpoints: the need to define explainability for IDS, the\nneed to create explanations tailored to various stakeholders, and the need to\ndesign metrics to evaluate explanations.",

    "abstract": "Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have gained immense popularity as an\nalternate method for numerically solving PDEs. Despite their empirical success\nwe are still building an understanding of the convergence properties of\ntraining on such constraints with gradient descent. It is known that, in the\nabsence of an explicit inductive bias, Neural Networks can struggle to learn or\napproximate even simple and well known functions in a sample efficient manner.\nThus the numerical approximation induced from few collocation points may not\ngeneralize over the entire domain. Meanwhile, a symbolic form can exhibit good\ngeneralization, with interpretability as a useful byproduct. However, symbolic\napproximations can struggle to simultaneously be concise and accurate.\nTherefore in this work we explore a NeuroSymbolic approach to approximate the\nsolution for PDEs. We observe that our approach work for several simple cases.\nWe illustrate the efficacy of our approach on Navier Stokes: Kovasznay flow\nwhere there are multiple physical quantities of interest governed with\nnon-linear coupled PDE system. Domain splitting is now becoming a popular trick\nto help PINNs approximate complex functions. We observe that a NeuroSymbolic\napproach can help such complex functions as well. We demonstrate\nDomain-splitting assisted NeuroSymbolic approach on a temporally varying\ntwo-dimensional Burger's equation. Finally we consider the scenario where PINNs\nhave to be solved for parameterized PDEs, for changing Initial-Boundary\nConditions and changes in the coefficient of the PDEs. Hypernetworks have shown\nto hold promise to overcome these challenges. We show that one can design\nHyper-NeuroSymbolic Networks which can combine the benefits of speed and\nincreased accuracy. We observe that that the NeuroSymbolic approximations are\nconsistently 1-2 order of magnitude better than just the neural or symbolic\napproximations.",

    "abstract": "We consider the fundamental problem of clock synchronization in a synchronous\nmulti-agent system. Each agent holds a clock with an arbitrary initial value,\nand clocks must eventually indicate the same value. Previous algorithms worked\nin static networks with drastic connectivity properties and assumed that global\ninformation is available at each agent. In this paper, we propose different\nsolutions for time-varying topologies that require neither strong connectivity\nnor any global knowledge on the network.\nFirst, we study the case of unbounded clocks, and propose a self-stabilizing\n$MinMax$ algorithm that works if, in each sufficiently long but bounded period\nof time, there is an agent, called a root, that can send messages, possibly\nindirectly, to all other agents. Such networks are highly dynamic in the sense\nthat roots may change arbitrarily over time. Moreover, the bound on the time\nrequired for achieving this rootedness property is unknown to the agents. Then\nwe present a finite-state algorithm that synchronizes periodic clocks in\ndynamic networks that are strongly connected over bounded period of time. Here\nalso, the bound on the time for achieving strong connectivity exists, but is\nnot supposed to be known. Interestingly, our algorithm unifies several\nseemingly different algorithms proposed previously for static networks. Next,\nwe show that strong connectivity is actually not required: our algorithm still\nworks when the network is just rooted over bounded period of time with a set of\nroots that becomes stable. Finally, we study the time and space complexities of\nour algorithms, and discuss how initial timing information allows for more\nefficient solutions.",

To address this issue, we propose a style-preserved modulation (SPM)\ncomprising two modulations processes: The first modulation incorporates the\ncontextual style and semantic layout, and then generates two fused modulation\nparameters. The second modulation employs the fused parameters to modulate\nfeature maps. By using such two modulations, SPM can inject the given semantic\nlayout while preserving the image-specific context style.

CL models can benefit from self-supervised\npre-training as it enables learning more generalizable task-agnostic features.\nHowever, the effect of self-supervised pre-training diminishes as the length of\ntask sequences increases. Furthermore, the domain shift between pre-training\ndata distribution and the task distribution reduces the generalizability of the\nlearned representations. To address these limitations, we propose Task Agnostic\nRepresentation Consolidation (TARC), a two-stage training paradigm for CL that\nintertwines task-agnostic and task-specific learning whereby self-supervised\ntraining is followed by supervised learning for each task. To further restrict\nthe deviation from the learned representations in the self-supervised stage, we\nemploy a task-agnostic auxiliary loss during the supervised stage.

    "abstract": "A cumbersome operation in many scientific fields, is inverting large\nfull-rank matrices. In this paper, we propose a coded computing approach for\nrecovering matrix inverse approximations. We first present an approximate\nmatrix inversion algorithm which does not require a matrix factorization, but\nuses a black-box least squares optimization solver as a subroutine, to give an\nestimate of the inverse of a real full-rank matrix. We then present a\ndistributed framework for which our algorithm can be implemented, and show how\nwe can leverage sparsest-balanced MDS generator matrices to devise matrix\ninversion coded computing schemes. We focus on balanced Reed-Solomon codes,\nwhich are optimal in terms of computational load; and communication from the\nworkers to the master server. We also discuss how our algorithms can be used to\ncompute the pseudoinverse of a full-rank matrix, and how the communication is\nsecured from eavesdroppers.",

    "abstract": "We develop a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for applications that deal\nwith sequential decisions and exogenous uncertainty, such as resource\nallocation and inventory management. In these applications, the uncertainty is\nonly due to exogenous variables like future demands. A popular approach is to\npredict the exogenous variables using historical data and then plan with the\npredictions. However, this indirect approach requires high-fidelity modeling of\nthe exogenous process to guarantee good downstream decision-making, which can\nbe impractical when the exogenous process is complex. In this work we propose\nan alternative approach based on hindsight learning which sidesteps modeling\nthe exogenous process. Our key insight is that, unlike Sim2Real RL, we can\nrevisit past decisions in the historical data and derive counterfactual\nconsequences for other actions in these applications. Our framework uses\nhindsight-optimal actions as the policy training signal and has strong\ntheoretical guarantees on decision-making performance. We develop an algorithm\nusing our framework to allocate compute resources for real-world Microsoft\nAzure workloads. The results show our approach learns better policies than\ndomain-specific heuristics and Sim2Real RL baselines.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, machine learning algorithms have become ubiquitous in a\nmultitude of high-stakes decision-making applications. The unparalleled ability\nof machine learning algorithms to learn patterns from data also enables them to\nincorporate biases embedded within. A biased model can then make decisions that\ndisproportionately harm certain groups in society -- limiting their access to\nfinancial services, for example. The awareness of this problem has given rise\nto the field of Fair ML, which focuses on studying, measuring, and mitigating\nunfairness in algorithmic prediction, with respect to a set of protected groups\n(e.g., race or gender). However, the underlying causes for algorithmic\nunfairness still remain elusive, with researchers divided between blaming\neither the ML algorithms or the data they are trained on. In this work, we\nmaintain that algorithmic unfairness stems from interactions between models and\nbiases in the data, rather than from isolated contributions of either of them.\nTo this end, we propose a taxonomy to characterize data bias and we study a set\nof hypotheses regarding the fairness-accuracy trade-offs that fairness-blind ML\nalgorithms exhibit under different data bias settings. On our real-world\naccount-opening fraud use case, we find that each setting entails specific\ntrade-offs, affecting fairness in expected value and variance -- the latter\noften going unnoticed. Moreover, we show how algorithms compare differently in\nterms of accuracy and fairness, depending on the biases affecting the data.\nFinally, we note that under specific data bias conditions, simple\npre-processing interventions can successfully balance group-wise error rates,\nwhile the same techniques fail in more complex settings.",

    "abstract": "Quantization is one of the most applied Deep Neural Network (DNN) compression\nstrategies, when deploying a trained DNN model on an embedded system or a cell\nphone. This is owing to its simplicity and adaptability to a wide range of\napplications and circumstances, as opposed to specific Artificial Intelligence\n(AI) accelerators and compilers that are often designed only for certain\nspecific hardware (e.g., Google Coral Edge TPU). With the growing demand for\nquantization, ensuring the reliability of this strategy is becoming a critical\nchallenge. Traditional testing methods, which gather more and more genuine data\nfor better assessment, are often not practical because of the large size of the\ninput space and the high similarity between the original DNN and its quantized\ncounterpart. As a result, advanced assessment strategies have become of\nparamount importance. In this paper, we present DiverGet, a search-based\ntesting framework for quantization assessment. DiverGet defines a space of\nmetamorphic relations that simulate naturally-occurring distortions on the\ninputs. Then, it optimally explores these relations to reveal the disagreements\namong DNNs of different arithmetic precision. We evaluate the performance of\nDiverGet on state-of-the-art DNNs applied to hyperspectral remote sensing\nimages.

    "abstract": "5G radio access network (RAN) is consuming much more energy than legacy RAN\ndue to the denser deployments of gNodeBs (gNBs) and higher single-gNB power\nconsumption. In an effort to achieve an energy-conserving RAN, this paper\ndevelops a dynamic on-off switching paradigm, where the ON/OFF states of gNBs\ncan be dynamically configured according to the evolvements of the associated\nusers. We formulate the dynamic sleep control for a cluster of gNBs as a Markov\ndecision process (MDP) and analyze various switching policies to reduce the\nenergy expenditure. The optimal policy of the MDP that minimizes the energy\nexpenditure can be derived from dynamic programming, but the computation is\nexpensive. To circumvent this issue, this paper puts forth a greedy policy and\nan index policy for gNB sleep control. When there is no constraint on the\nnumber of gNBs that can be turned off, we prove the dual-threshold structure of\nthe greedy policy and analyze its connections with the optimal policy. Inspired\nby the dual-threshold structure and Whittle index, we develop an index policy\nby decoupling the original MDP into multiple one-dimensional MDPs -- the\nindexability of the decoupled MDP is proven and an algorithm to compute the\nindex is proposed. Extensive simulation results verify that the index policy\nexhibits close-to-optimal performance in terms of the energy expenditure of the\ngNB cluster. As far as the computational complexity is concerned, on the other\nhand, the index policy is much more efficient than the optimal policy, which is\ncomputationally prohibitive when the number of gNBs is large.",

To address this, we developed\nSnapperGPS, a fully open-source, low-cost and low-power location tracking\nsystem designed for wildlife tracking. SnapperGPS comprises three parts, all of\nwhich are open-source: (i) a small, low-cost and low-power receiver; (ii) a web\napplication to configure the receiver via USB; and (iii) a cloud-based platform\nfor processing recorded data.

The\nreceiver records very short and low-resolution samples resulting in\nparticularly low power consumption, outperforming existing systems. It can run\nfor more than a year on a 40 mAh battery.

In this paper, we attempt to make camera relocalization\nwork in these extreme situations. To this end, we propose: (i) a hierarchical\nlocalization system, where we leverage temporal information and (ii) a novel\nenvironment-aware image enhancement method to boost the robustness and\naccuracy. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate superior performance\nin favor of our method under two extreme settings: localizing an autonomous\nunderwater vehicle and localizing a planetary rover in a Mars-like desert. In\naddition, our method achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art\nmethods on the indoor benchmark (7-Scenes dataset) using only 20% training\ndata.",

    "abstract": "In order to promote the use of machine learning in 5G, the International\nTelecommunication Union (ITU) proposed in 2021 the second edition of the ITU\nAI/ML in 5G challenge, with over 1600 participants from 82 countries. This work\ndetails the second place solution overall, which is also the winning solution\nof the Graph Neural Networking Challenge 2021. We tackle the problem of\ngeneralization when applying a model to a 5G network that may have longer paths\nand larger link capacities than the ones observed in training. To achieve this,\nwe propose to first extract robust features related to Queueing Theory (QT),\nand then fine-tune the analytical baseline prediction using a modification of\nthe Routenet Graph Neural Network (GNN) model. The proposed solution\ngeneralizes much better than simply using Routenet, and manages to reduce the\nanalytical baseline's 10.42 mean absolute percent error to 1.45 (1.27 with an\nensemble). This suggests that making small changes to an approximate model that\nis known to be robust can be an effective way to improve accuracy without\ncompromising generalization.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we revisit the marking decisions made in the standard adaptive\nfinite element method (AFEM). Experience shows that a na\\\"{i}ve marking policy\nleads to inefficient use of computational resources for adaptive mesh\nrefinement (AMR). Consequently, using AFEM in practice often involves ad-hoc or\ntime-consuming offline parameter tuning to set appropriate parameters for the\nmarking subroutine. To address these practical concerns, we recast AMR as a\nMarkov decision process in which refinement parameters can be selected\non-the-fly at run time, without the need for pre-tuning by expert users. In\nthis new paradigm, the refinement parameters are also chosen adaptively via a\nmarking policy that can be optimized using methods from reinforcement learning.\nWe use the Poisson equation to demonstrate our techniques on $h$- and\n$hp$-refinement benchmark problems, and our experiments suggest that superior\nmarking policies remain undiscovered for many classical AFEM applications.\nFurthermore, an unexpected observation from this work is that marking policies\ntrained on one family of PDEs are sometimes robust enough to perform well on\nproblems far outside the training family. For illustration, we show that a\nsimple $hp$-refinement policy trained on 2D domains with only a single\nre-entrant corner can be deployed on far more complicated 2D domains, and even\n3D domains, without significant performance loss. For reproduction and broader\nadoption, we accompany this work with an open-source implementation of our\nmethods.",

Existing\nadvanced methods accomplish ST-VSR tasks through the association of Spatial and\nTemporal video super-resolution (S-VSR and T-VSR). These methods require two\nalignments and fusions in S-VSR and T-VSR, which is obviously redundant and\nfails to sufficiently explore the information flow of consecutive spatial LR\nframes. Although bidirectional learning (future-to-past and past-to-future) was\nintroduced to cover all input frames, the direct fusion of final predictions\nfails to sufficiently exploit intrinsic correlations of bidirectional motion\nlearning and spatial information from all frames. We propose an effective yet\nefficient recurrent network with bidirectional interaction for ST-VSR, where\nonly one alignment and fusion is needed.

In this scenario, high levels of polyphony, as\nin the number of overlapping sound sources, are prone to happen resulting in a\ncomplex acoustic outcome. Sound Event Detection (SED) tasks analyze acoustic\nscenarios in order to identify the occurring events and their respective\ntemporal information. However, highly dense scenarios can be hard to process\nand have not been studied in depth. Here we show, using a Convolutional\nRecurrent Neural Network (CRNN), how birdsong polyphonic scenarios can be\ndetected when dealing with higher polyphony and how effectively this type of\nmodel can face a very dense scene with up to 10 overlapping birds. We found\nthat models trained with denser examples (i.e., higher polyphony) learn at a\nsimilar rate as models that used simpler samples in their training set.\nAdditionally, the model trained with the densest samples maintained a\nconsistent score for all polyphonies, while the model trained with the least\ndense samples degraded as the polyphony increased. Our results demonstrate that\nhighly dense acoustic scenarios can be dealt with using CRNNs.

In some\napplications (such as forensic biometrics, satellite photography or outdoor\nscene identification) classical image registration systems fail due to one of\nthe images compared represents a tiny piece of the other image. For instance,\nin forensics palmprint recognition, it is usual to find only a small piece of\nthe palmprint, but in the database, the whole palmprint has been enrolled. The\nmain reason of the poor behaviour of classical image registration methods is\nthe gap between the amounts of salient points of both images, which is related\nto the number of points to be considered as outliers. Usually, the difficulty\nof finding a good match increases when the image that represents the tiny part\nof the scene has been drastically rotated. Again, in the case of palmprint\nforensics, it is difficult to decide a priori the orientation of the found tiny\npalmprint image. We present a rotation invariant registration method that\nexplicitly considers that the image to be matched is a small piece of a larger\nimage.

    "abstract": "Robotic perception models, such as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), are becoming\nmore computationally intensive and there are several models being trained with\naccuracy and latency trade-offs. However, modern latency accuracy trade-offs\nlargely report mean accuracy for single-step vision tasks, but there is little\nwork showing which model to invoke for multi-step control tasks in robotics.\nThe key challenge in a multi-step decision making is to make use of the right\nmodels at right times to accomplish the given task. That is, the accomplishment\nof the task with a minimum control cost and minimum perception time is a\ndesideratum; this is known as the model selection problem. In this work, we\nprecisely address this problem of invoking the correct sequence of perception\nmodels for multi-step control. In other words, we provide a provably optimal\nsolution to the model selection problem by casting it as a multi-objective\noptimization problem balancing the control cost and perception time. The key\ninsight obtained from our solution is how the variance of the perception models\nmatters (not just the mean accuracy) for multi-step decision making, and to\nshow how to use diverse perception models as a primitive for energy-efficient\nrobotics. Further, we demonstrate our approach on a photo-realistic drone\nlanding simulation using visual navigation in AirSim.

    "abstract": "Regression-based methods can estimate body, hand, and even full-body models\nfrom monocular images by directly mapping raw pixels to the model parameters in\na feed-forward manner. However, minor deviation in parameters may lead to\nnoticeable misalignment between the estimated meshes and input images,\nespecially in the context of full-body mesh recovery. To address this issue, we\npropose a Pyramidal Mesh Alignment Feedback (PyMAF) loop in our regression\nnetwork for well-aligned human mesh recovery and extend it to PyMAF-X for the\nrecovery of expressive full-body models. The core idea of PyMAF is to leverage\na feature pyramid and rectify the predicted parameters explicitly based on the\nmesh-image alignment status. Specifically, given the currently predicted\nparameters, mesh-aligned evidences will be extracted from finer-resolution\nfeatures accordingly and fed back for parameter rectification. To enhance the\nalignment perception, an auxiliary dense supervision is employed to provide\nmesh-image correspondence guidance while a spatial alignment attention is\nintroduced to enable the awareness of the global contexts for our network. When\nextending PyMAF for full-body mesh recovery, an adaptive integration strategy\nis proposed in PyMAF-X to adjust the elbow-twist rotations, which produces\nnatural wrist poses while maintaining the well-aligned performance of the\npart-specific estimations. The efficacy of our approach is validated on several\nbenchmark datasets for body-only and full-body mesh recovery, where PyMAF and\nPyMAF-X effectively improve the mesh-image alignment and achieve new\nstate-of-the-art results.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the challenging problem of 3D concept grounding\n(i.e. segmenting and learning visual concepts) by looking at RGBD images and\nreasoning about paired questions and answers. Existing visual reasoning\napproaches typically utilize supervised methods to extract 2D segmentation\nmasks on which concepts are grounded. In contrast, humans are capable of\ngrounding concepts on the underlying 3D representation of images. However,\ntraditionally inferred 3D representations (e.g., point clouds, voxelgrids, and\nmeshes) cannot capture continuous 3D features flexibly, thus making it\nchallenging to ground concepts to 3D regions based on the language description\nof the object being referred to. To address both issues, we propose to leverage\nthe continuous, differentiable nature of neural fields to segment and learn\nconcepts. Specifically, each 3D coordinate in a scene is represented as a\nhigh-dimensional descriptor. Concept grounding can then be performed by\ncomputing the similarity between the descriptor vector of a 3D coordinate and\nthe vector embedding of a language concept, which enables segmentations and\nconcept learning to be jointly learned on neural fields in a differentiable\nfashion. As a result, both 3D semantic and instance segmentations can emerge\ndirectly from question answering supervision using a set of defined neural\noperators on top of neural fields (e.g., filtering and counting). Experimental\nresults show that our proposed framework outperforms\nunsupervised/language-mediated segmentation models on semantic and instance\nsegmentation tasks, as well as outperforms existing models on the challenging\n3D aware visual reasoning tasks. Furthermore, our framework can generalize well\nto unseen shape categories and real scans.",

It may significantly\nincrease the error rate of gates compared to running them individually.\nCrosstalk can be mitigated through scheduling or hardware tuning.

    "abstract": "De Finetti theorems tell us that if we expect the likelihood of outcomes to\nbe independent of their order, then these sequences of outcomes could be\nequivalently generated by drawing an experiment at random from a distribution,\nand repeating it over and over. In particular, the quantum de Finetti theorem\nsays that exchangeable sequences of quantum states are always represented by\ndistributions over a single state produced over and over. The main result of\nthis paper is that this quantum de Finetti construction has a universal\nproperty as a categorical limit. This allows us to pass canonically between\ncategorical treatments of finite dimensional quantum theory and the infinite\ndimensional. The treatment here is through understanding properties of\n(co)limits with respect to the contravariant functor which takes a C*-algebra\ndescribing a physical system to its convex, compact space of states, and\nthrough discussion of the Radon probability monad. We also show that the same\ncategorical analysis also justifies a continuous de Finetti theorem for\nclassical probability.",

The DFT can be efficiently implemented through the use of\nfast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms, thus reducing chip area, power\nconsumption, processing time, and consumption of other hardware resources. This\npaper proposes three new hybrid DFT 1024-point DFT approximations and their\nrespective fast algorithms. These approximate DFT (ADFT) algorithms have\nsignificantly reduced circuit complexity and power consumption compared to\ntraditional FFT approaches while trading off a subtle loss in computational\nprecision which is acceptable for digital beamforming applications in RF\nantenna implementations. ADFT algorithms have not been introduced for\nbeamforming beyond $N = 32$, but this paper anticipates the need for massively\nlarge adaptive arrays for future 5G and 6G systems. Digital CMOS circuit\ndesigns for the ADFTs show the resulting improvements in both circuit\ncomplexity and power consumption metrics. Simulation results show similar or\nlower critical path delay with up to 48.5% lower chip area compared to a\nstandard Cooley-Tukey FFT. The time-area and dynamic power metrics are reduced\nup to 66.0%.

    "abstract": "Deep MRI reconstruction is commonly performed with conditional models that\nmap undersampled data as input onto fully-sampled data as output. Conditional\nmodels perform de-aliasing under knowledge of the accelerated imaging operator,\nso they poorly generalize under domain shifts in the operator. Unconditional\nmodels are a powerful alternative that instead learn generative image priors to\nimprove reliability against domain shifts. Recent diffusion models are\nparticularly promising given their high representational diversity and sample\nquality. Nevertheless, projections through a static image prior can lead to\nsuboptimal performance. Here we propose a novel MRI reconstruction, AdaDiff,\nbased on an adaptive diffusion prior. To enable efficient image sampling, an\nadversarial mapper is introduced that enables use of large diffusion steps. A\ntwo-phase reconstruction is performed with the trained prior: a rapid-diffusion\nphase that produces an initial reconstruction, and an adaptation phase where\nthe diffusion prior is updated to minimize reconstruction loss on acquired\nk-space data. Demonstrations on multi-contrast brain MRI clearly indicate that\nAdaDiff achieves superior performance to competing models in cross-domain\ntasks, and superior or on par performance in within-domain tasks.",

    "abstract": "For neural video codec, it is critical, yet challenging, to design an\nefficient entropy model which can accurately predict the probability\ndistribution of the quantized latent representation. However, most existing\nvideo codecs directly use the ready-made entropy model from image codec to\nencode the residual or motion, and do not fully leverage the spatial-temporal\ncharacteristics in video. To this end, this paper proposes a powerful entropy\nmodel which efficiently captures both spatial and temporal dependencies. In\nparticular, we introduce the latent prior which exploits the correlation among\nthe latent representation to squeeze the temporal redundancy. Meanwhile, the\ndual spatial prior is proposed to reduce the spatial redundancy in a\nparallel-friendly manner. In addition, our entropy model is also versatile.\nBesides estimating the probability distribution, our entropy model also\ngenerates the quantization step at spatial-channel-wise. This content-adaptive\nquantization mechanism not only helps our codec achieve the smooth rate\nadjustment in single model but also improves the final rate-distortion\nperformance by dynamic bit allocation. Experimental results show that, powered\nby the proposed entropy model, our neural codec can achieve 18.2% bitrate\nsaving on UVG dataset when compared with H.266 (VTM) using the highest\ncompression ratio configuration.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a new paradigm to stabilize uncertain stochastic linear\nsystems. Herein, second moment polytopic (SMP) systems are proposed that\ngeneralize systems with both uncertainty and randomness. The SMP systems are\ncharacterized by second moments of the stochastic system matrices and the\nuncertain parameters. Further, a fundamental theory for guaranteeing stability\nof the SMP systems is established. It is challenging to analyze the SMP systems\nowing to both the uncertainty and randomness. An idea to overcome this\ndifficulty is to expand the SMP systems and exclude the randomness. Because the\nexpanded systems contain only the uncertainty, their stability can be analyzed\nvia robust stability theory. The stability of the expanded systems is\nequivalent to statistical stability of the SMP systems. These facts provide\nsufficient conditions for the stability of the SMP systems as linear matrix\ninequalities (MIs). In controller design for the SMP systems, the linear MIs\nreduce to cubic MIs whose solutions correspond to feedback gains. The cubic MIs\nare transformed into simpler quadratic MIs that can be solved using\noptimization techniques. Moreover, solving such non-convex MIs is relaxed into\nthe iteration of a convex optimization. Solutions to the iterative optimization\nprovide feedback gains that stabilize the SMP systems. As demonstrated here,\nthe SMP systems represent linear dynamics with uncertain mean and covariance\nand other existing systems such as independently identically distributed\ndynamics and random polytopes.

In this paper, we mine cross-age test\nsets based on the VoxCeleb dataset and propose our age-invariant speaker\nrepresentation(AISR) learning method. Since the VoxCeleb is collected from the\nYouTube platform, the dataset consists of cross-age data inherently. However,\nthe meta-data does not contain the speaker age label. Therefore, we adopt the\nface age estimation method to predict the speaker age value from the associated\nvisual data, then label the audio recording with the estimated age. We\nconstruct multiple Cross-Age test sets on VoxCeleb (Vox-CA), which deliberately\nselect the positive trials with large age-gap. Also, the effect of nationality\nand gender is considered in selecting negative pairs to align with Vox-H cases.\nThe baseline system performance drops from 1.939\\% EER on the Vox-H test set to\n10.419\\% on the Vox-CA20 test set, which indicates how difficult the cross-age\nscenario is.

In the proposed study, we first use the Lucas-Kanade pyramidal optical\nflow algorithm to perform deformable image registration of chest computed\ntomography scan images of four patients with lung cancer. We then track three\ninternal points close to the lung tumor based on the previously computed\ndeformation field and predict their position with a recurrent neural network\n(RNN) trained using real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) and gradient clipping.\nThe breathing data is quite regular, sampled at approximately 2.5Hz, and\nincludes artificial drift in the spine direction. The amplitude of the motion\nof the tracked points ranged from 12.0mm to 22.7mm. Finally, we propose a\nsimple method for recovering and predicting 3D tumor images from the tracked\npoints and the initial tumor image based on a linear correspondence model and\nNadaraya-Watson non-linear regression.

Speech separation on the other hand is the\nchallenging task of separating individual speakers from an overlapping mixed\nsignal of various speakers. Speaker attractors are high-dimensional embedding\nvectors that pull the time-frequency bins of each speaker's speech towards\nthemselves while repelling those belonging to other speakers. In this work, we\nexplore the possibility of using these powerful speaker attractors for\nzero-shot speaker adaptation in multi-speaker TTS synthesis and propose speaker\nattractor text to speech (SATTS). Through various experiments, we show that\nSATTS can synthesize natural speech from text from an unseen target speaker's\nreference signal which might have less than ideal recording conditions, i.e.\nreverberations or mixed with other speakers.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses two major challenges in terahertz (THz) channel\nestimation: the beam-split phenomenon, i.e., beam misalignment because of\nfrequency-independent analog beamformers, and computational complexity because\nof the usage of ultra-massive number of antennas to compensate propagation\nlosses. Data-driven techniques are known to mitigate the complexity of this\nproblem but usually require the transmission of the datasets from the users to\na central server entailing huge communications overhead. In this work, we\nemploy federated learning (FL), wherein the users transmit only the model\nparameters instead of the whole dataset, for THz channel estimation to improve\nthe communications-efficiency. In order to accurately estimate the channel\ndespite beam-split, we propose a beamspace support alignment technique without\nrequiring additional hardware. Compared to the previous works, our method\nprovides higher channel estimation accuracy as well as approximately $68$ times\nlower communications overhead.",

    "abstract": "In this work, a dynamic-Immersed--Boundary method combined with a\nBGK-Lattice--Boltzmann technique is developed and critically discussed. The\nfluid evolution is obtained on a three-dimensional lattice with 19 reticular\nvelocities (D3Q19 computational molecule) while the immersed body surface is\nmodeled as a collection of Lagrangian points responding to an elastic potential\nand a bending resistance. A moving least squares reconstruction is used to\naccurately interpolate flow quantities and the forcing field needed to enforce\nthe boundary condition on immersed bodies. The proposed model is widely\nvalidated against well known benchmark data for rigid and deformable objects.\nRigid transport is validated by computing the settling of a sphere under\ngravity for five different conditions. Then, the tumbling of inertial particles\nwith different shape is considered, recovering the Jefferey orbit for a prolate\nspheroid. Moreover, the revolution period for an oblate spheroid and for a\ndisk-like particle is obtained as a function of the Reynolds number. The\nexistence of a critical Reynolds number is demonstrated for both cases above\nwhich revolution is inhibited. The transport of deformable objects is also\nconsidered. The steady deformation of a membrane under shear for three\ndifferent mechanical stiffness is assessed. Then, the tumbling of a\nweakly-deformable spheroid under shear is systematically analyzed as a function\nstrain stiffness, bending resistance and membrane mass.",

    "abstract": "Given an image of a white shoe drawn on a blackboard, how are the white\npixels deemed (say by human minds) to be informative for recognizing the shoe\nwithout any labeling information on the pixels? Here we investigate such a\n\"white shoe\" recognition problem from the perspective of tensor network (TN)\nmachine learning and quantum entanglement. Utilizing a generative TN that\ncaptures the probability distribution of the features as quantum amplitudes, we\npropose an unsupervised recognition scheme of informative features with the\nvariations of entanglement entropy (EE) caused by designed measurements. In\nthis way, a given sample, where the values of its features are statistically\nmeaningless, is mapped to the variations of EE that are statistically\nmeaningful. We show that the EE variations identify the features that are\ncritical to recognize this specific sample, and the EE itself reveals the\ninformation distribution from the TN model. The signs of the variations further\nreveal the entanglement structures among the features. We test the validity of\nour scheme on a toy dataset of strip images, the MNIST dataset of hand-drawn\ndigits, and the fashion-MNIST dataset of the pictures of fashion articles.

A main feature of the\napproach is that it completely avoids the online construction step, which makes\nit very attractive when the ARX model adapted recursively at runtime. The\nsolution algorithm relies on a coordinate-descent augmented Lagrangian (CDAL)\nmethod previously proposed by the authors, that we adapt here to exploit the\nspecial structure of ARX-based MPC. The implementation of the resulting\nCDAL-ARX algorithm is matrix-free and library-free, and hence amenable for\ndeployment in industrial embedded platforms.

Next,\nthe 3D bounding boxes along with the data volume are input to a 3D U-Net\nnetwork that is designed to segment the primary cell in each 3D bounding box,\nand in turn, to carry out instance segmentation of cells in the entire volume.\nThe promising performance of the proposed method is shown in comparison with\nsome current deep learning-based 3D instance segmentation methods.",

    "abstract": "Tackling new machine learning problems with neural networks always means\noptimizing numerous hyperparameters that define their structure and strongly\nimpact their performances. In this work, we study the use of goal-oriented\nsensitivity analysis, based on the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion\n(HSIC), for hyperparameter analysis and optimization. Hyperparameters live in\nspaces that are often complex and awkward. They can be of different natures\n(categorical, discrete, boolean, continuous), interact, and have\ninter-dependencies. All this makes it non-trivial to perform classical\nsensitivity analysis. We alleviate these difficulties to obtain a robust\nanalysis index that is able to quantify hyperparameters' relative impact on a\nneural network's final error. This valuable tool allows us to better understand\nhyperparameters and to make hyperparameter optimization more interpretable. We\nillustrate the benefits of this knowledge in the context of hyperparameter\noptimization and derive an HSIC-based optimization algorithm that we apply on\nMNIST and Cifar, classical machine learning data sets, but also on the\napproximation of Runge function and Bateman equations solution, of interest for\nscientific machine learning. This method yields neural networks that are both\ncompetitive and cost-effective.",

    "abstract": "Massive vector field datasets are common in multi-spectral optical and radar\nsensors and modern multimodal MRI data, among many other areas of application.\nIn this paper we develop a novel stochastic functional analysis approach for\ndetecting anomalies based on the covariance structure of nominal stochastic\nbehavior across a domain with multi-band vector field data. An optimal vector\nfield Karhunen-Loeve (KL) expansion is applied to such random field data. A\nseries of multilevel orthogonal functional subspaces is constructed from the\ngeometry of the domain, adapted from the KL expansion. Detection is achieved by\nexamining the projection of the random field on the multilevel basis. The\nanomalies can be quantified in suitable normed spaces based on local and global\ninformation. In addition, reliable hypothesis tests are formed with\ncontrollable distributions that do not require prior assumptions on probability\ndistributions of the data. Only the covariance function is needed, which makes\nfor significantly simpler estimates. Furthermore this approach allows\nstochastic vector-based fusion of anomalies without any loss of information.\nThe method is applied to the important problem of deforestation and degradation\nin the Amazon forest. This is a complex non-monotonic process, as forests can\ndegrade and recover. This particular problem is further compounded by the\npresence of clouds that are hard to remove with current masking algorithms.\nUsing multi-spectral satellite data from Sentinel 2, the multilevel filter is\nconstructed and anomalies are treated as deviations from the initial state of\nthe forest. Forest anomalies are quantified with robust hypothesis tests and\ndistinguished from false variations such as cloud cover. Our approach shows the\nadvantage of using multiple bands of data in a vectorized complex, leading to\nbetter anomaly detection beyond the capabilities of scalar-based methods.",

In\nthe special situation of shallow ANNs with just one-dimensional ANN layers we\nalso prove for every Lipschitz continuous target function that every gradient\nflow trajectory on this large submanifold of the ANN parameter space is\nglobally bounded.

To go beyond these limitations, a non-local variant of\nQAOA, namely recursive QAOA (RQAOA), was proposed to improve the quality of\napproximate solutions. The RQAOA has been studied comparatively less than QAOA,\nand it is less understood, for instance, for what family of instances it may\nfail to provide high quality solutions. However, as we are tackling\n$\\mathsf{NP}$-hard problems (specifically, the Ising spin model), it is\nexpected that RQAOA does fail, raising the question of designing even better\nquantum algorithms for combinatorial optimization. In this spirit, we identify\nand analyze cases where RQAOA fails and, based on this, propose a reinforcement\nlearning enhanced RQAOA variant (RL-RQAOA) that improves upon RQAOA. We show\nthat the performance of RL-RQAOA improves over RQAOA: RL-RQAOA is strictly\nbetter on these identified instances where RQAOA underperforms, and is\nsimilarly performing on instances where RQAOA is near-optimal.

    "abstract": "Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have recently achieved\nleading performances in many generative tasks. However, the inherited iterative\nsampling process costs hinder their applications to text-to-speech deployment.\nThrough the preliminary study on diffusion model parameterization, we find that\nprevious gradient-based TTS models require hundreds or thousands of iterations\nto guarantee high sample quality, which poses a challenge for accelerating\nsampling. In this work, we propose ProDiff, on progressive fast diffusion model\nfor high-quality text-to-speech. Unlike previous work estimating the gradient\nfor data density, ProDiff parameterizes the denoising model by directly\npredicting clean data to avoid distinct quality degradation in accelerating\nsampling. To tackle the model convergence challenge with decreased diffusion\niterations, ProDiff reduces the data variance in the target site via knowledge\ndistillation. Specifically, the denoising model uses the generated\nmel-spectrogram from an N-step DDIM teacher as the training target and distills\nthe behavior into a new model with N/2 steps. As such, it allows the TTS model\nto make sharp predictions and further reduces the sampling time by orders of\nmagnitude. Our evaluation demonstrates that ProDiff needs only 2 iterations to\nsynthesize high-fidelity mel-spectrograms, while it maintains sample quality\nand diversity competitive with state-of-the-art models using hundreds of steps.\nProDiff enables a sampling speed of 24x faster than real-time on a single\nNVIDIA 2080Ti GPU, making diffusion models practically applicable to\ntext-to-speech synthesis deployment for the first time. Our extensive ablation\nstudies demonstrate that each design in ProDiff is effective, and we further\nshow that ProDiff can be easily extended to the multi-speaker setting.
