    "abstract": "Towards a safe and comfortable driving, road scene segmentation is a\nrudimentary problem in camera-based advance driver assistance systems (ADAS).\nDespite of the great achievement of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for\nsemantic segmentation task, the high computational efforts of CNN based methods\nis still a challenging area. In recent work, we proposed a novel approach to\nutilise the advantages of CNNs for the task of road segmentation at reasonable\ncomputational effort. The runtime benefits from using irregular super pixels as\nbasis for the input for the CNN rather than the image grid, which tremendously\nreduces the input size. Although, this method achieved remarkable low\ncomputational time in both training and testing phases, the lower resolution of\nthe super pixel domain yields naturally lower accuracy compared to high cost\nstate of the art methods. In this work, we focus on a refinement of the road\nsegmentation utilising a Conditional Random Field (CRF).The refinement\nprocedure is limited to the super pixels touching the predicted road boundary\nto keep the additional computational effort low. Reducing the input to the\nsuper pixel domain allows the CNNs structure to stay small and efficient to\ncompute while keeping the advantage of convolutional layers and makes them\neligible for ADAS. Applying CRF compensate the trade off between accuracy and\ncomputational efficiency. The proposed system obtained comparable performance\namong the top performing algorithms on the KITTI road benchmark and its fast\ninference makes it particularly suitable for realtime applications.",

    "abstract": "Prior work introduced a gradient descent trained expert system that\nconceptually combines the learning capabilities of neural networks with the\nunderstandability and defensible logic of an expert system. This system was\nshown to be able to learn patterns from data and to perform decision-making at\nlevels rivaling those reported by neural network systems. The principal\nlimitation of the approach, though, was the necessity for the manual\ndevelopment of a rule-fact network (which is then trained using\nbackpropagation). This paper proposes a technique for overcoming this\nsignificant limitation, as compared to neural networks. Specifically, this\npaper proposes the use of larger and denser-than-application need rule-fact\nnetworks which are trained, pruned, manually reviewed and then re-trained for\nuse. Multiple types of networks are evaluated under multiple operating\nconditions and these results are presented and assessed. Based on these\nindividual experimental condition assessments, the proposed technique is\nevaluated. The data presented shows that error rates as low as 3.9% (mean, 1.2%\nmedian) can be obtained, demonstrating the efficacy of this technique for many\napplications.",

    "abstract": "Multiple kernel clustering (MKC) is committed to achieving optimal\ninformation fusion from a set of base kernels. Constructing precise and local\nkernel matrices is proved to be of vital significance in applications since the\nunreliable distant-distance similarity estimation would degrade clustering\nper-formance. Although existing localized MKC algorithms exhibit improved\nperformance compared to globally-designed competi-tors, most of them widely\nadopt KNN mechanism to localize kernel matrix by accounting for {\\tau} -nearest\nneighbors. However, such a coarse manner follows an unreasonable strategy that\nthe ranking importance of different neighbors is equal, which is impractical in\napplications. To alleviate such problems, this paper proposes a novel local\nsample-weighted multiple kernel clustering (LSWMKC) model. We first construct a\nconsensus discriminative affinity graph in kernel space, revealing the latent\nlocal structures. Further, an optimal neighborhood kernel for the learned\naffinity graph is output with naturally sparse property and clear block\ndiagonal structure. Moreover, LSWMKC im-plicitly optimizes adaptive weights on\ndifferent neighbors with corresponding samples. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our LSWMKC possesses better local manifold representation and\noutperforms existing kernel or graph-based clustering algo-rithms.

From 1950 to 2018, model size in language models\nincreased steadily by seven orders of magnitude. The trend then accelerated,\nwith model size increasing by another five orders of magnitude in just 4 years\nfrom 2018 to 2022. Vision models grew at a more constant pace, totaling 7\norders of magnitude of growth between 1950 and 2022.\nWe also identify that, since 2020, there have been many language models below\n20B parameters, many models above 70B parameters, but a scarcity of models in\nthe 20-70B parameter range. We refer to that scarcity as the parameter gap.\nWe provide some stylized facts about the parameter gap and propose a few\nhypotheses to explain it. The explanations we favor are: (a) increasing model\nsize beyond 20B parameters requires adopting different parallelism techniques,\nwhich makes mid-sized models less cost-effective, (b) GPT-3 was one order of\nmagnitude larger than previous language models, and researchers afterwards\nprimarily experimented with bigger models to outperform it.

    "abstract": "The physical interaction of aerial robots with their environment has\ncountless potential applications and is an emerging area with many open\nchallenges. Fully-actuated multirotors have been introduced to tackle some of\nthese challenges. They provide complete control over position and orientation\nand eliminate the need for attaching a multi-DoF manipulation arm to the robot.\nHowever, there are many open problems before they can be used in real-world\napplications. Researchers have introduced some methods for physical interaction\nin limited settings. Their experiments primarily use prototype-level software\nwithout an efficient path to integration with real-world applications. We\ndescribe a new cost-effective solution for integrating these robots with the\nexisting software and hardware flight systems for real-world applications and\nexpand it to physical interaction applications. On the other hand, the existing\ncontrol approaches for fully-actuated robots assume conservative limits for the\nthrusts and moments available to the robot. Using conservative assumptions for\nthese already-inefficient robots makes their interactions even less optimal and\nmay even result in many feasible physical interaction applications becoming\ninfeasible. This work proposes a real-time method for estimating the complete\nset of instantaneously available forces and moments that robots can use to\noptimize their physical interaction performance. Finally, many real-world\napplications where aerial robots can improve the existing manual solutions deal\nwith deformable objects. However, the perception and planning for their\nmanipulation is still challenging. This research explores how aerial physical\ninteraction can be extended to deformable objects. It provides a detection\nmethod suitable for manipulating deformable one-dimensional objects and\nintroduces a new perspective on planning the manipulation of these objects.",

    "title": "On The Universality of Diagrams for Causal Inference and The Causal  Reproducing Property",
    "abstract": "We propose Universal Causality, an overarching framework based on category\ntheory that defines the universal property that underlies causal inference\nindependent of the underlying representational formalism used. More formally,\nuniversal causal models are defined as categories consisting of objects and\nmorphisms between them representing causal influences, as well as structures\nfor carrying out interventions (experiments) and evaluating their outcomes\n(observations). Functors map between categories, and natural transformations\nmap between a pair of functors across the same two categories. Abstract causal\ndiagrams in our framework are built using universal constructions from category\ntheory, including the limit or co-limit of an abstract causal diagram, or more\ngenerally, the Kan extension. We present two foundational results in universal\ncausal inference. The first result, called the Universal Causality Theorem\n(UCT), pertains to the universality of diagrams, which are viewed as functors\nmapping both objects and relationships from an indexing category of abstract\ncausal diagrams to an actual causal model whose nodes are labeled by random\nvariables, and edges represent functional or probabilistic relationships. UCT\nstates that any causal inference can be represented in a canonical way as the\nco-limit of an abstract causal diagram of representable objects. UCT follows\nfrom a basic result in the theory of sheaves. The second result, the Causal\nReproducing Property (CRP), states that any causal influence of a object X on\nanother object Y is representable as a natural transformation between two\nabstract causal diagrams. CRP follows from the Yoneda Lemma, one of the deepest\nresults in category theory. The CRP property is analogous to the reproducing\nproperty in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces that served as the foundation for\nkernel methods in machine learning.",

Unlike manual efforts that exploit all\navailable run-time information, existing approaches usually leverage only a\nsingle type of monitoring data (often logs or metrics) or fail to make\neffective use of the joint information among multi-source data. Consequently,\nmany false predictions occur. To better understand the manifestations of system\nanomalies, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study based on a large amount\nof heterogeneous data, i.e., logs and metrics. Our study demonstrates that\nsystem anomalies could manifest distinctly in different data types. Thus,\nintegrating heterogeneous data can help recover the complete picture of a\nsystem's health status. In this context, we propose HADES, the first work to\neffectively identify system anomalies based on heterogeneous data. Our approach\nemploys a hierarchical architecture to learn a global representation of the\nsystem status by fusing log semantics and metric patterns. It captures\ndiscriminative features and meaningful interactions from multi-modal data via a\nnovel cross-modal attention module, enabling accurate system anomaly detection.\nWe evaluate HADES extensively on large-scale simulated and industrial datasets.\nThe experimental results present the superiority of HADES in detecting system\nanomalies on heterogeneous data.

    "abstract": "Robots have the potential to perform search for a variety of applications\nunder different scenarios. Our work is motivated by humanitarian assistant and\ndisaster relief (HADR) where often it is critical to find signs of life in the\npresence of conflicting criteria, objectives, and information. We believe\nergodic search can provide a framework for exploiting available information as\nwell as exploring for new information for applications such as HADR, especially\nwhen time is of the essence. Ergodic search algorithms plan trajectories such\nthat the time spent in a region is proportional to the amount of information in\nthat region, and is able to naturally balance exploitation (myopically\nsearching high-information areas) and exploration (visiting all locations in\nthe search space for new information). Existing ergodic search algorithms, as\nwell as other information-based approaches, typically consider search using\nonly a single information map. However, in many scenarios, the use of multiple\ninformation maps that encode different types of relevant information is common.\nErgodic search methods currently do not possess the ability for simultaneous\nnor do they have a way to balance which information gets priority. This leads\nus to formulate a Multi-Objective Ergodic Search (MOES) problem, which aims at\nfinding the so-called Pareto-optimal solutions, for the purpose of providing\nhuman decision makers various solutions that trade off between conflicting\ncriteria. To efficiently solve MOES, we develop a framework called Sequential\nLocal Ergodic Search (SLES) that converts a MOES problem into a \"weight space\ncoverage\" problem. It leverages the recent advances in ergodic search methods\nas well as the idea of local optimization to efficiently approximate the\nPareto-optimal front.

In the\nsystem, a transmitter observes a dynamic source and sends updates to a remote\nreceiver through a communication channel. We assume that the channel is\nerror-free but suffers a random delay. Moreover, when an update has been\ntransmitted for too long, the transmission will be terminated immediately, and\nthe update will be discarded. We assume the maximum transmission time is\npredetermined and is not controlled by the transmitter. The receiver will\nmaintain estimates of the current state of the dynamic source using the\nreceived updates. In this paper, we adopt the Age of Incorrect Information\n(AoII) as the performance metric and investigate the problem of optimizing the\ntransmitter's action in each time slot to minimize AoII. We first characterize\nthe optimization problem using Markov Decision Process and evaluate the\nperformance of some canonical transmission policies. Then, by leveraging the\npolicy improvement theorem, we prove that, under a simple and easy-to-verify\ncondition, the optimal policy for the transmitter is the one that initiates a\ntransmission whenever the channel is idle and AoII is not zero. Lastly, we take\nthe case where the transmission time is geometrically distributed as an\nexample. For this example, we verify the condition numerically and provide\nnumerical results that highlight the performance of the optimal policy.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we present a deep learning-optimization framework to tackle\ndynamic mixed-integer programs. Specifically, we develop a bidirectional Long\nShort Term Memory (LSTM) framework that can process information forward and\nbackward in time to learn optimal solutions to sequential decision-making\nproblems. We demonstrate our approach in predicting the optimal decisions for\nthe single-item capacitated lot-sizing problem (CLSP), where a binary variable\ndenotes whether to produce in a period or not. Due to the dynamic nature of the\nproblem, the CLSP can be treated as a sequence labeling task where a recurrent\nneural network can capture the problem's temporal dynamics. Computational\nresults show that our LSTM-Optimization (LSTM-Opt) framework significantly\nreduces the solution time of benchmark CLSP problems without much loss in\nfeasibility and optimality. For example, the predictions at the 85\\% level\nreduce the CPLEX solution time by a factor of 9 on average for over 240,000\ntest instances with an optimality gap of less than 0.05\\% and 0.4\\%\ninfeasibility in the test set. Also, models trained using shorter planning\nhorizons can successfully predict the optimal solution of the instances with\nlonger planning horizons. For the hardest data set, the LSTM predictions at the\n25\\% level reduce the solution time of 70 CPU hours to less than 2 CPU minutes\nwith an optimality gap of 0.8\\% and without any infeasibility. The LSTM-Opt\nframework outperforms classical ML algorithms, such as the logistic regression\nand random forest, in terms of the solution quality, and exact approaches, such\nas the ($\\ell$, S) and dynamic programming-based inequalities, with respect to\nthe solution time improvement. Our machine learning approach could be\nbeneficial in tackling sequential decision-making problems similar to CLSP,\nwhich need to be solved repetitively, frequently, and in a fast manner.",

    "abstract": "While artificial intelligence (AI) holds promise for supporting healthcare\nproviders and improving the accuracy of medical diagnoses, a lack of\ntransparency in the composition of datasets exposes AI models to the\npossibility of unintentional and avoidable mistakes. In particular, public and\nprivate image datasets of dermatological conditions rarely include information\non skin color. As a start towards increasing transparency, AI researchers have\nappropriated the use of the Fitzpatrick skin type (FST) from a measure of\npatient photosensitivity to a measure for estimating skin tone in algorithmic\naudits of computer vision applications including facial recognition and\ndermatology diagnosis. In order to understand the variability of estimated FST\nannotations on images, we compare several FST annotation methods on a diverse\nset of 460 images of skin conditions from both textbooks and online dermatology\natlases. We find the inter-rater reliability between three board-certified\ndermatologists is comparable to the inter-rater reliability between the\nboard-certified dermatologists and two crowdsourcing methods. In contrast, we\nfind that the Individual Typology Angle converted to FST (ITA-FST) method\nproduces annotations that are significantly less correlated with the experts'\nannotations than the experts' annotations are correlated with each other. These\nresults demonstrate that algorithms based on ITA-FST are not reliable for\nannotating large-scale image datasets, but human-centered, crowd-based\nprotocols can reliably add skin type transparency to dermatology datasets.\nFurthermore, we introduce the concept of dynamic consensus protocols with\ntunable parameters including expert review that increase the visibility of\ncrowdwork and provide guidance for future crowdsourced annotations of large\nimage datasets.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning is increasingly critical for analysis of the ever-growing\ncorpora of overhead imagery. Advanced computer vision object detection\ntechniques have demonstrated great success in identifying objects of interest\nsuch as ships, automobiles, and aircraft from satellite and drone imagery. Yet\nrelying on computer vision opens up significant vulnerabilities, namely, the\nsusceptibility of object detection algorithms to adversarial attacks. In this\npaper we explore the efficacy and drawbacks of adversarial camouflage in an\noverhead imagery context. While a number of recent papers have demonstrated the\nability to reliably fool deep learning classifiers and object detectors with\nadversarial patches, most of this work has been performed on relatively uniform\ndatasets and only a single class of objects. In this work we utilize the\nVisDrone dataset, which has a large range of perspectives and object sizes. We\nexplore four different object classes: bus, car, truck, van. We build a library\nof 24 adversarial patches to disguise these objects, and introduce a patch\ntranslucency variable to our patches. The translucency (or alpha value) of the\npatches is highly correlated to their efficacy. Further, we show that while\nadversarial patches may fool object detectors, the presence of such patches is\noften easily uncovered, with patches on average 24% more detectable than the\nobjects the patches were meant to hide. This raises the question of whether\nsuch patches truly constitute camouflage. Source code is available at\nhttps://github.com/IQTLabs/camolo.",

    "abstract": "Neural network binarization accelerates deep models by quantizing their\nweights and activations into 1-bit. However, there is still a huge performance\ngap between Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) and their full-precision (FP)\ncounterparts. As the quantization error caused by weights binarization has been\nreduced in earlier works, the activations binarization becomes the major\nobstacle for further improvement of the accuracy. BNN characterises a unique\nand interesting structure, where the binary and latent FP activations exist in\nthe same forward pass (\\textit{i.e.} $\\text{Binarize}(\\mathbf{a}_F) =\n\\mathbf{a}_B$). To mitigate the information degradation caused by the\nbinarization operation from FP to binary activations, we establish a novel\ncontrastive learning framework while training BNNs through the lens of Mutual\nInformation (MI) maximization. MI is introduced as the metric to measure the\ninformation shared between binary and FP activations, which assists\nbinarization with contrastive learning. Specifically, the representation\nability of the BNNs is greatly strengthened via pulling the positive pairs with\nbinary and FP activations from the same input samples, as well as pushing\nnegative pairs from different samples (the number of negative pairs can be\nexponentially large). This benefits the downstream tasks, not only\nclassification but also segmentation and depth estimation,~\\textit{etc}. The\nexperimental results show that our method can be implemented as a pile-up\nmodule on existing state-of-the-art binarization methods and can remarkably\nimprove the performance over them on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet, in addition to\nthe great generalization ability on NYUD-v2.",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning methods overcome the key bottleneck for building\nmore capable AI: limited availability of labeled data. However, one of the\ndrawbacks of self-supervised architectures is that the representations that\nthey learn are implicit and it is hard to extract meaningful information about\nthe encoded world states, such as 3D structure of the visual scene encoded in a\ndepth map. Moreover, in the visual domain such representations only rarely\nundergo evaluations that may be critical for downstream tasks, such as vision\nfor autonomous cars. Herein, we propose a framework for evaluating visual\nrepresentations for illumination invariance in the context of depth perception.\nWe develop a new predictive coding-based architecture and a hybrid\nfully-supervised/self-supervised learning method. We propose a novel\narchitecture that extends the predictive coding approach: PRedictive Lateral\nbottom-Up and top-Down Encoder-decoder Network (PreludeNet), which explicitly\nlearns to infer and predict depth from video frames. In PreludeNet, the\nencoder's stack of predictive coding layers is trained in a self-supervised\nmanner, while the predictive decoder is trained in a supervised manner to infer\nor predict the depth. We evaluate the robustness of our model on a new\nsynthetic dataset, in which lighting conditions (such as overall illumination,\nand effect of shadows) can be be parametrically adjusted while keeping all\nother aspects of the world constant. PreludeNet achieves both competitive depth\ninference performance and next frame prediction accuracy. We also show how this\nnew network architecture, coupled with the hybrid\nfully-supervised/self-supervised learning method, achieves balance between the\nsaid performance and invariance to changes in lighting.

In\nsome situations, a robot navigation solution relies only on inertial sensors\nand as a consequence, the navigation solution drifts in time. In this paper, we\npropose the MoRPI framework, a mobile robot pure inertial approach. Instead of\ntravelling in a straight line trajectory, the robot moves in a periodic motion\ntrajectory to enable peak-to-peak estimation. In this manner, instead of\nperforming three integrations to calculate the robot position in a classical\ninertial solution, an empirical formula is used to estimate the travelled\ndistance. Two types of MoRPI approaches are suggested, where one is based on\nboth accelerometer and gyroscope readings while the other is only on\ngyroscopes. Closed form analytical solutions are derived to show that MoRPI\nproduces lower position error compared to the classical pure inertial solution.\nIn addition, to evaluate the proposed approach, field experiments were made\nwith a mobile robot equipped with two types of inertial sensors. In total, 143\ntrajectories with a time duration of 75 minutes were collected and evaluated.\nThe results show the benefits of using our approach.

    "abstract": "Evaluating the similarity of non-rigid shapes with significant partiality is\na fundamental task in numerous computer vision applications. Here, we propose a\nnovel axiomatic method to match similar regions across shapes. Matching similar\nregions is formulated as the alignment of the spectra of operators closely\nrelated to the Laplace-Beltrami operator (LBO). The main novelty of the\nproposed approach is the consideration of differential operators defined on a\nmanifold with multiple metrics. The choice of a metric relates to fundamental\nshape properties while considering the same manifold under different metrics\ncan thus be viewed as analyzing the underlying manifold from different\nperspectives. Specifically, we examine the scale-invariant metric and the\ncorresponding scale-invariant Laplace-Beltrami operator (SI-LBO) along with the\nregular metric and the regular LBO. We demonstrate that the scale-invariant\nmetric emphasizes the locations of important semantic features in articulated\nshapes. A truncated spectrum of the SI-LBO consequently better captures locally\ncurved regions and complements the global information encapsulated in the\ntruncated spectrum of the regular LBO. We show that matching these dual spectra\noutperforms competing axiomatic frameworks when tested on standard benchmarks.\nWe introduced a new dataset and compare the proposed method with the\nstate-of-the-art learning based approach in a cross-database configuration.\nSpecifically, we show that, when trained on one data set and tested on another,\nthe proposed axiomatic approach which does not involve training, outperforms\nthe deep learning alternative.",

    "abstract": "Social media platforms disseminate extensive volumes of online content,\nincluding true and, in particular, false rumors. Previous literature has\nstudied the diffusion of offline rumors, yet more research is needed to\nunderstand the diffusion of online rumors. In this paper, we examine the role\nof lifetime and crowd effects in social media sharing behavior for true vs.\nfalse rumors. Based on 126,301 Twitter cascades, we find that the sharing\nbehavior is characterized by lifetime and crowd effects that explain\ndifferences in the spread of true as opposed to false rumors. All else equal,\nwe find that a longer lifetime is associated with less sharing activities, yet\nthe reduction in sharing is larger for false than for true rumors. Hence,\nlifetime is an important determinant explaining why false rumors die out.\nFurthermore, we find that the spread of false rumors is characterized by\nherding tendencies (rather than wisdom of crowds), whereby the spread of false\nrumors becomes proliferated at a larger retweet depth. These findings explain\ndifferences in the diffusion dynamics of true and false rumors and further\noffer practical implications for social media platforms.",

    "abstract": "Research on intelligent tutoring systems has been exploring data-driven\nmethods to deliver effective adaptive assistance. While much work has been done\nto provide adaptive assistance when students seek help, they may not seek help\noptimally. This had led to the growing interest in proactive adaptive\nassistance, where the tutor provides unsolicited assistance upon predictions of\nstruggle or unproductivity. Determining when and whether to provide\npersonalized support is a well-known challenge called the assistance dilemma.\nAddressing this dilemma is particularly challenging in open-ended domains,\nwhere there can be several ways to solve problems. Researchers have explored\nmethods to determine when to proactively help students, but few of these\nmethods have taken prior hint usage into account. In this paper, we present a\nnovel data-driven approach to incorporate students' hint usage in predicting\ntheir need for help. We explore its impact in an intelligent tutor that deals\nwith the open-ended and well-structured domain of logic proofs. We present a\ncontrolled study to investigate the impact of an adaptive hint policy based on\npredictions of HelpNeed that incorporate students' hint usage. We show\nempirical evidence to support that such a policy can save students a\nsignificant amount of time in training, and lead to improved posttest results,\nwhen compared to a control without proactive interventions. We also show that\nincorporating students' hint usage significantly improves the adaptive hint\npolicy's efficacy in predicting students' HelpNeed, thereby reducing training\nunproductivity, reducing possible help avoidance, and increasing possible help\nappropriateness (a higher chance of receiving help when it was likely to be\nneeded). We conclude with suggestions on the domains that can benefit from this\napproach as well as the requirements for adoption.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses an important problem of ranking the pre-trained deep\nneural networks and screening the most transferable ones for downstream tasks.\nIt is challenging because the ground-truth model ranking for each task can only\nbe generated by fine-tuning the pre-trained models on the target dataset, which\nis brute-force and computationally expensive. Recent advanced methods proposed\nseveral lightweight transferability metrics to predict the fine-tuning results.\nHowever, these approaches only capture static representations but neglect the\nfine-tuning dynamics. To this end, this paper proposes a new transferability\nmetric, called \\textbf{S}elf-challenging \\textbf{F}isher \\textbf{D}iscriminant\n\\textbf{A}nalysis (\\textbf{SFDA}), which has many appealing benefits that\nexisting works do not have. First, SFDA can embed the static features into a\nFisher space and refine them for better separability between classes. Second,\nSFDA uses a self-challenging mechanism to encourage different pre-trained\nmodels to differentiate on hard examples. Third, SFDA can easily select\nmultiple pre-trained models for the model ensemble. Extensive experiments on\n$33$ pre-trained models of $11$ downstream tasks show that SFDA is efficient,\neffective, and robust when measuring the transferability of pre-trained models.\nFor instance, compared with the state-of-the-art method NLEEP, SFDA\ndemonstrates an average of $59.1$\\% gain while bringing $22.5$x speedup in\nwall-clock time.

However, the\nsimple concatenation of defocus map, which represents the blur level, leads to\nsuboptimal performance. Considering the spatial variant property of the defocus\nblur and the blur level indicated in the defocus map, we employ the defocus map\nas conditional guidance to adjust the features from the input blurring images\ninstead of simple concatenation. Then we propose a simple but effective network\nwith spatial modulation based on the defocus map.

    "title": "A Large Scale Search Dataset for Unbiased Learning to Rank",
    "abstract": "The unbiased learning to rank (ULTR) problem has been greatly advanced by\nrecent deep learning techniques and well-designed debias algorithms. However,\npromising results on the existing benchmark datasets may not be extended to the\npractical scenario due to the following disadvantages observed from those\npopular benchmark datasets: (1) outdated semantic feature extraction where\nstate-of-the-art large scale pre-trained language models like BERT cannot be\nexploited due to the missing of the original text;(2) incomplete display\nfeatures for in-depth study of ULTR, e.g., missing the displayed abstract of\ndocuments for analyzing the click necessary bias; (3) lacking real-world user\nfeedback, leading to the prevalence of synthetic datasets in the empirical\nstudy. To overcome the above disadvantages, we introduce the Baidu-ULTR\ndataset. It involves randomly sampled 1.2 billion searching sessions and 7,008\nexpert annotated queries, which is orders of magnitude larger than the existing\nones. Baidu-ULTR provides:(1) the original semantic feature and a pre-trained\nlanguage model for easy usage; (2) sufficient display information such as\nposition, displayed height, and displayed abstract, enabling the comprehensive\nstudy of different biases with advanced techniques such as causal discovery and\nmeta-learning; and (3) rich user feedback on search result pages (SERPs) like\ndwelling time, allowing for user engagement optimization and promoting the\nexploration of multi-task learning in ULTR. In this paper, we present the\ndesign principle of Baidu-ULTR and the performance of benchmark ULTR algorithms\non this new data resource, favoring the exploration of ranking for long-tail\nqueries and pre-training tasks for ranking. The Baidu-ULTR dataset and\ncorresponding baseline implementation are available at\nhttps://github.com/ChuXiaokai/baidu_ultr_dataset.",

    "abstract": "This letter studies the energy-efficient design in a downlink multi-antenna\nmulti-user system consisting of a multi-antenna base station (BS) and multiple\nsingle-antenna users, by considering the practical non-linear power amplifier\n(PA) efficiency and the on-off power consumption of radio frequency (RF) chain\nat each transmit antenna. Under this setup, we jointly optimize the transmit\nbeamforming and antenna on/off selection at the BS to minimize its total power\nconsumption while ensuring the individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise\nratio (SINR) constraints at the users. However, due to the non-linear PA\nefficiency and the on-off RF chain power consumption, the formulated\nSINR-constrained power minimization problem is highly non-convex and difficult\nto solve. To tackle this issue, we propose an efficient algorithm to obtain a\nhigh-quality solution based on the technique of sequential convex approximation\n(SCA). We provide numerical results to validate the performance of our proposed\ndesign. It is shown that at the optimized solution, the BS tends to activate\nfewer antennas and use higher power transmission at each antenna to exploit the\nnon-linear PA efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Not everybody can be equipped with professional photography skills and\nsufficient shooting time, and there can be some tilts in the captured images\noccasionally. In this paper, we propose a new and practical task, named\nRotation Correction, to automatically correct the tilt with high content\nfidelity in the condition that the rotated angle is unknown. This task can be\neasily integrated into image editing applications, allowing users to correct\nthe rotated images without any manual operations. To this end, we leverage a\nneural network to predict the optical flows that can warp the tilted images to\nbe perceptually horizontal. Nevertheless, the pixel-wise optical flow\nestimation from a single image is severely unstable, especially in large-angle\ntilted images. To enhance its robustness, we propose a simple but effective\nprediction strategy to form a robust elastic warp. Particularly, we first\nregress the mesh deformation that can be transformed into robust initial\noptical flows. Then we estimate residual optical flows to facilitate our\nnetwork the flexibility of pixel-wise deformation, further correcting the\ndetails of the tilted images. To establish an evaluation benchmark and train\nthe learning framework, a comprehensive rotation correction dataset is\npresented with a large diversity in scenes and rotated angles. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that even in the absence of the angle prior, our\nalgorithm can outperform other state-of-the-art solutions requiring this prior.\nThe codes and dataset will be available at\nhttps://github.com/nie-lang/RotationCorrection.",

    "abstract": "Many augmented reality (AR) applications rely on omnidirectional environment\nlighting to render photorealistic virtual objects. When the virtual objects\nconsist of reflective materials, such as a metallic sphere, the required\nlighting information to render such objects can consist of privacy-sensitive\ninformation that is outside the current camera view. In this paper, we show,\nfor the first time, that accuracy-driven multi-view environment lighting can\nreveal out-of-camera scene information and compromise privacy. We present a\nsimple yet effective privacy attack that extracts sensitive scene information\nsuch as human face and text information from the rendered objects, under a\nnumber of application scenarios.\nTo defend against such attacks, we develop a novel $IPC^{2}S$ defense and a\nconditional $R^2$ defense. Our $IPC^{2}S$ defense, used in conjunction with a\ngeneric lighting reconstruction method, preserves the scene geometry while\nobfuscating the privacy-sensitive information. As a proof-of-concept, we\nleverage existing OCR and face detection models to identify text and human\nfaces from past camera observations and blur the color pixels associated with\ndetected regions. We evaluate the visual quality impact of our defense by\ncomparing rendered virtual objects to ones rendered with a generic\nmulti-lighting reconstruction technique, ARKit, and $R^2$ defense. Our visual\nand quantitative results demonstrate that our defense leads to structurally\nsimilar reflections with up to 0.98 SSIM score across a variety of rendering\nscenarios while preserving sensitive information by reducing the automatic\nextraction success rate to at most 8.8%.",

The query-item\nrelevance labels typically used to train the ranking model are often noisy\nmeasurements of human behavior, e.g., product rating for product search. The\ncoarse measurements make the ground truth ranking non-unique with respect to a\nsingle relevance criterion. To resolve ambiguity, it is desirable to train a\nmodel using many relevance criteria, giving rise to Multi-Label LTR (MLLTR).\nMoreover, it formulates multiple goals that may be conflicting yet important to\noptimize for simultaneously, e.g., in product search, a ranking model can be\ntrained based on product quality and purchase likelihood to increase revenue.\nIn this research, we leverage the Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) aspect of\nthe MLLTR problem and employ recently developed MOO algorithms to solve it.\nSpecifically, we propose a general framework where the information from labels\ncan be combined in a variety of ways to meaningfully characterize the trade-off\namong the goals. Our framework allows for any gradient based MOO algorithm to\nbe used for solving the MLLTR problem.

The goal is to transform an\ninitial shape A into a target shape B. We are interested in characterising the\nclass of shapes which can be transformed into each other in such a scenario,\nunder the additional constraint of maintaining global connectivity at all\ntimes. This was one of the main problems left open by $[$Michail et al.,\nJCSS'19$]$. Note that the considered question is about structural feasibility\nof transformations, which we exclusively deal with via centralised constructive\nproofs. Distributed solutions are left for future work and form an interesting\nresearch direction. Past work made some progress for the special class of nice\nshapes. We here consider the class of orthogonal convex shapes, where for any\ntwo nodes $u, v$ in a horizontal or vertical line on the grid, there is no\nempty cell between $u$ and $v$. We develop a generic centralised transformation\nand prove that, for any pair $A$, $B$ of colour-consistent orthogonal convex\nshapes, it can transform $A$ into $B$. In light of the existence of blocked\nshapes in the considered class, we use a minimal 3-node seed to trigger the\ntransformation. The running time of our transformation is an optimal $O(n^2)$\nsequential moves, where $n=|A|=|B|$. We leave as an open problem the existence\nof a universal connectivity-preserving transformation with a small seed.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition with contrastive learning\nhas attracted much attention. Recent literature shows that data augmentation\nand large sets of contrastive pairs are crucial in learning such\nrepresentations. In this paper, we found that directly extending contrastive\npairs based on normal augmentations brings limited returns in terms of\nperformance, because the contribution of contrastive pairs from the normal data\naugmentation to the loss get smaller as training progresses. Therefore, we\ndelve into hard contrastive pairs for contrastive learning. Motivated by the\nsuccess of mixing augmentation strategy which improves the performance of many\ntasks by synthesizing novel samples, we propose SkeleMixCLR: a contrastive\nlearning framework with a spatio-temporal skeleton mixing augmentation\n(SkeleMix) to complement current contrastive learning approaches by providing\nhard contrastive samples. First, SkeleMix utilizes the topological information\nof skeleton data to mix two skeleton sequences by randomly combing the cropped\nskeleton fragments (the trimmed view) with the remaining skeleton sequences\n(the truncated view). Second, a spatio-temporal mask pooling is applied to\nseparate these two views at the feature level. Third, we extend contrastive\npairs with these two views. SkeleMixCLR leverages the trimmed and truncated\nviews to provide abundant hard contrastive pairs since they involve some\ncontext information from each other due to the graph convolution operations,\nwhich allows the model to learn better motion representations for action\nrecognition. Extensive experiments on NTU-RGB+D, NTU120-RGB+D, and PKU-MMD\ndatasets show that SkeleMixCLR achieves state-of-the-art performance. Codes are\navailable at https://github.com/czhaneva/SkeleMixCLR.",

In this work, we propose empirical benchmarks of FL methods\nconsidering both performance and monetary cost with three real-world datasets:\nelectronic health records, skin cancer images, and electrocardiogram datasets.\nWe also propose Federated learning with Proximal regularization eXcept local\nNormalization (FedPxN), which, using a simple combination of FedProx and FedBN,\noutperforms all other FL algorithms while consuming only slightly more power\nthan the most power efficient method.",

    "abstract": "We study the classic divide-and-choose method for equitably allocating\ndivisible goods between two players who are rational, self-interested Bayesian\nagents. The players have additive private values for the goods. The prior\ndistributions on those values are independent and common knowledge.\nWe characterize the structure of optimal divisions in the divide-and-choose\ngame and show how to efficiently compute equilibria. We identify several\nstriking differences between optimal strategies in the cases of known versus\nunknown preferences. Most notably, the divider has a compelling\n\"diversification\" incentive in creating the chooser's two options. This\nincentive, hereto unnoticed, leads to multiple goods being divided at\nequilibrium, quite contrary to the divider's optimal strategy when preferences\nare known.\nIn many contexts, such as buy-and-sell provisions between partners, or in\njudging fairness, it is important to assess the relative expected utilities of\nthe divider and chooser. Those utilities, we show, depend on the players'\nuncertainties about each other's values, the number of goods being divided, and\nwhether the divider can offer multiple alternative divisions. We prove that,\nwhen values are independently and identically distributed across players and\ngoods, the chooser is strictly better off for a small number of goods, while\nthe divider is strictly better off for a large number of goods.",

We are motivated by applications where there is a natural\ncomplementarity between certain elements: e.g., in a movie recommendation\nsystem, watching the first movie in a series complements the experience of\nwatching a second (and a third, etc.). This is not expressible using only\nsubmodular functions which can represent only competitiveness between elements.\nWe extend the purely submodular approach in two ways. First, we assume that the\nobjective can be decomposed into the sum of monotone suBmodular and\nsuPermodular function, known as a BP objective. Here, complementarity is\nnaturally modeled by the supermodular component. We develop a UCB-style\nalgorithm, where at each round a noisy gain is revealed after an action is\ntaken that balances refining beliefs about the unknown objectives (exploration)\nand choosing actions that appear promising (exploitation). Defining regret in\nterms of submodular and supermodular curvature with respect to a full-knowledge\ngreedy baseline, we show that this algorithm achieves at most $O(\\sqrt{T})$\nregret after $T$ rounds of play. Second, for those functions that do not admit\na BP structure, we provide analogous regret guarantees in terms of their\nsubmodularity ratio; this is applicable for functions that are almost, but not\nquite, submodular. We numerically study the tasks of movie recommendation on\nthe MovieLens dataset, and selection of training subsets for classification.\nThrough these examples, we demonstrate the algorithm's performance as well as\nthe shortcomings of viewing these problems as being solely submodular.",

This problem is of great importance\nfor terrain mapping in complicated environment and has great potentials in\nlegged locomotion applications. To address the polytopic planar region\ncharacterization problem, we propose a two-stage solution scheme. At the first\nstage, the planar regions embedded within a sequence of depth images are\nextracted individually first and then merged to establish a terrain map\ncontaining only planar regions in a selected frame. To simplify the\nrepresentations of the planar regions that are applicable to foothold planning\nfor legged robots, we further approximate the extracted planar regions via\nlow-dimensional polytopes at the second stage. With the polytopic\nrepresentation, the proposed approach achieves a great balance between accuracy\nand simplicity. Experimental validations with RGB-D cameras are conducted to\ndemonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme. The proposed scheme\nsuccessfully characterizes the planar regions via polytopes with acceptable\naccuracy. More importantly, the run time of the overall perception scheme is\nless than 10ms (i.e., > 100Hz) throughout the tests, which strongly illustrates\nthe advantages of our approach developed in this paper.",

These papers paint a rather bleak\npicture of past decades of IR evaluation, at odds with the community's overall\nemphasis on practical experimentation and measurable improvement.\nOur purpose in this work is to challenge that position. In particular, we\nargue that mappings from categorical and ordinal data to sets of points on the\nnumber line are valid provided there is an external reason for each target\npoint to have been selected. We first consider the general role of measurement\nscales, and of categorical, ordinal, interval, ratio, and absolute data\ncollections. In connection with the first two of those categories we also\nprovide examples of the knowledge that is captured and represented by numeric\nmappings to the real number line. Focusing then on information retrieval, we\nargue that document rankings are categorical data, and that the role of an\neffectiveness metric is to provide a single value that represents the\nusefulness to a user or population of users of any given ranking, with\nusefulness able to be represented as a continuous variable on a ratio scale.\nThat is, we argue that current IR metrics are well-founded, and, moreover, that\nthose metrics are more meaningful in their current form than in the proposed\n\"intervalized\" versions.",

The central idea is to to decompose the\nlatent space in an invariant factor and the symmetry group itself. The\ncomponents semantically correspond to intrinsic data classes and poses\nrespectively. The learner is self-supervised and infers these semantics based\non relative symmetry information. The approach is motivated by theoretical\nresults from group theory and guarantees representations that are lossless,\ninterpretable and disentangled.

The\ncollected data is rich in information, as one can detect accidents (e.g. cars)\nin real time, or assess injury/sickness over a given time span (e.g. health\ndevices). Due to its chaotic nature and massive amounts of datapoints,\ntimeseries are hard to label manually. Furthermore new classes within the data\ncould emerge over time (contrary to e.g. handwritten digits), which would\nrequire relabeling the data.\nIn this paper we present SuSL4TS, a deep generative Gaussian mixture model\nfor semi-unsupervised learning, to classify time series data.

Most existing DG ReID methods employ the same\nfeatures for the updating of the feature extractor and classifier parameters.\nThis common practice causes the model to overfit to existing feature styles in\nthe source domain, resulting in sub-optimal generalization ability on target\ndomains even if meta-learning is used. To solve this problem, we propose a\nnovel style interleaved learning framework. Unlike conventional learning\nstrategies, interleaved learning incorporates two forward propagations and one\nbackward propagation for each iteration. We employ the features of interleaved\nstyles to update the feature extractor and classifiers using different forward\npropagations, which helps the model avoid overfitting to certain domain styles.\nIn order to fully explore the advantages of style interleaved learning, we\nfurther propose a novel feature stylization approach to diversify feature\nstyles.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a method to learn the Cartesian velocity of objects using\nan object detection network on automotive radar data. The proposed method is\nself-supervised in terms of generating its own training signal for the\nvelocities. Labels are only required for single-frame, oriented bounding boxes\n(OBBs). Labels for the Cartesian velocities or contiguous sequences, which are\nexpensive to obtain, are not required. The general idea is to pre-train an\nobject detection network without velocities using single-frame OBB labels, and\nthen exploit the network's OBB predictions on unlabelled data for velocity\ntraining. In detail, the network's OBB predictions of the unlabelled frames are\nupdated to the timestamp of a labelled frame using the predicted velocities and\nthe distances between the updated OBBs of the unlabelled frame and the OBB\npredictions of the labelled frame are used to generate a self-supervised\ntraining signal for the velocities. The detection network architecture is\nextended by a module to account for the temporal relation of multiple scans and\na module to represent the radars' radial velocity measurements explicitly. A\ntwo-step approach of first training only OBB detection, followed by training\nOBB detection and velocities is used. Further, a pre-training with\npseudo-labels generated from radar radial velocity measurements bootstraps the\nself-supervised method of this paper. Experiments on the publicly available\nnuScenes dataset show that the proposed method almost reaches the velocity\nestimation performance of a fully supervised training, but does not require\nexpensive velocity labels. Furthermore, we outperform a baseline method which\nuses only radial velocity measurements as labels.",

However, current methods lack a full\nunderstanding of different types of OOD data: there are benign OOD data that\ncan be properly adapted to enhance the learning performance, while other malign\nOOD data would severely degenerate the classification result. To Harness OOD\ndata, this paper proposes HOOD method that can leverage the content and style\nfrom each image instance to identify benign and malign OOD data.

In contrast, the malign OOD data inherit unknown\ncontents but carry familiar styles, by detecting them can improve model\nrobustness against deceiving anomalies. Thanks to the proposed novel\ndisentanglement and data augmentation techniques, HOOD can effectively deal\nwith OOD examples in unknown and open environments, whose effectiveness is\nempirically validated in three typical OOD applications including OOD\ndetection, open-set semi-supervised learning, and open-set domain adaptation.",

For MDS coded\ndistributed storage system private information retrieval was proposed and the\ncapacity of PIR schemes for MDS coded distributed storage was studied. Star\nproduct PIR schemes from general coded distributed storage system with\ncolluding servers were constructed over general finite fields. These star\nproduct schemes has no restriction on the sizes of fields and can be\nconstructed for coded distributed storage with large number of servers. In this\npaper we first propose and prove the Singleton type upper bound on the storage\nrate, ratio of colluding servers and the retrieval rate of the star product PIR\nschemes. Secondly star product PIR schemes for coded distributed storage from\nalgebraic geometry (AG) codes are analysed. We prove that when the number of\nthe servers goes to the infinity, star product PIR schemes with colluding\nservers for AG-coded distributed storage have parameters closing to the\nSingleton type upper bound if the field is large. Comparing with the star\nproduct PIR schemes for Reed-Solomon coded and Reed-Muller coded distributed\nstorage we show that PIR schemes with colluding servers for AG coded\ndistributed storage have their performance advantages. AG-code based star\nproduct PIR schemes with colluding, Byzantine and unresponsive servers are\ndiscussed. $q$-ary BCH-code based star product PIR schemes for replicated data\nstorage is also studied.",

To do\nso, we adopt a variational approach consisting of minimizing a natural cost\nfunctional involving Rayleigh quotients, by means of simple adiabatic technics\nand multivalued feedforward neural parametrisation of the solutions. Compelling\nsuccesses are reported for a 10-dimensional eigenvalue problem corresponding to\na Kolmogorov operator associated with a mixing Stepanov flow. We moreover show\nthat the approach allows for providing accurate eigensolutions for a 5-D\nSchr\\\"odinger operator having $32$ metastable states. In addition, we address\nthe so-called Gelfand superlinear problem having exponential nonlinearities, in\ndimension $4$, and for nontrivial domains exhibiting cavities. In particular,\nwe obtain NN-approximations of high-energy solutions approaching singular ones.\nWe stress that each of these results are obtained using small-size neural\nnetworks in situations where classical methods are hopeless due to the curse of\ndimensionality.

    "abstract": "Learning algorithms for Deep Neural Networks are typically based on\nsupervised end-to-end Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) training with error\nbackpropagation (backprop). Backprop algorithms require a large number of\nlabelled training samples to achieve high performance. However, in many\nrealistic applications, even if there is plenty of image samples, very few of\nthem are labelled, and semi-supervised sample-efficient training strategies\nhave to be used. Hebbian learning represents a possible approach towards sample\nefficient training; however, in current solutions, it does not scale well to\nlarge datasets. In this paper, we present FastHebb, an efficient and scalable\nsolution for Hebbian learning which achieves higher efficiency by 1) merging\ntogether update computation and aggregation over a batch of inputs, and 2)\nleveraging efficient matrix multiplication algorithms on GPU. We validate our\napproach on different computer vision benchmarks, in a semi-supervised learning\nscenario. FastHebb outperforms previous solutions by up to 50 times in terms of\ntraining speed, and notably, for the first time, we are able to bring Hebbian\nalgorithms to ImageNet scale.",

    "title": "Evolutionary Stability of Other-Regarding Preferences Under Complexity  Costs",
    "abstract": "The evolution of preferences that account for other agents' fitness, or\nother-regarding preferences, has been modeled with the \"indirect approach\" to\nevolutionary game theory. Under the indirect evolutionary approach, agents make\ndecisions by optimizing a subjective utility function. Evolution may select for\nsubjective preferences that differ from the fitness function, and in\nparticular, subjective preferences for increasing or reducing other agents'\nfitness. However, indirect evolutionary models typically artificially restrict\nthe space of strategies that agents might use (assuming that agents always play\na Nash equilibrium under their subjective preferences), and dropping this\nrestriction can undermine the finding that other-regarding preferences are\nselected for. Can the indirect evolutionary approach still be used to explain\nthe apparent existence of other-regarding preferences, like altruism, in\nhumans? We argue that it can, by accounting for the costs associated with the\ncomplexity of strategies, giving (to our knowledge) the first account of the\nrelationship between strategy complexity and the evolution of preferences. Our\nmodel formalizes the intuition that agents face tradeoffs between the low\ncognitive cost of simple strategies within a single context, and the ability of\nmore complex (subjective utility-maximizing) strategies to interpolate across\ncontexts. For a single game, these penalties lead to selection for a simple\nfixed-action strategy, but across games, when there is a sufficiently large\npenalty on a strategy's number of context-specific parameters, a strategy of\nmaximizing subjective (other-regarding) utility is stable again. Overall, our\nanalysis provides a more nuanced picture of when other-regarding preferences\nwill evolve.",

    "abstract": "The Distributed Diffusion Kalman Filter (DDKF) algorithm in all its magnitude\nhas earned great attention lately and has shown an elaborate way to address the\nissue of distributed optimization over networks. Estimation and tracking of a\nsingle state vector collectively by nodes have been the point of focus. In\nreality, however, there are several multi-task-oriented issues where the\noptimal state vector for each node may not be the same. Its objective is to\nknow many related tasks simultaneously, rather than the typical single-task\nproblems. This work considers sensor networks for distributed multi-task\ntracking in which individual nodes communicate with its immediate nodes. A\ndiffusion-based distributed multi-task tracking algorithm is developed. This is\ndone by implementing an unsupervised adaptive clustering process, which aids\nnodes in forming clusters and collaborating on tasks. For distributed target\ntracking, an adaptive clustering approach, which gives agents the ability to\nidentify and select through adaptive adjustments of combination weights nodes\nwho to collaborate with and who not to in order to estimate the common state\nvector. This gave rise to an effective level of cooperation for improving state\nvector estimation accuracy, especially in cases where a cluster's background\nexperience is unknown. To demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm, computer\nsimulations were conducted. Comparison has been carried out for the Diffusion\nKalman Filter multitask with respect to the Adapt then combine (ATC) diffusion\nschemes utilizing both static and adaptive combination weights. Results showed\nthat the ATC diffusion schemes algorithm has great performance with the\nadaptive combiners as compared to static combiners.",

    "abstract": "Although audio-visual representation has been proved to be applicable in many\ndownstream tasks, the representation of dancing videos, which is more specific\nand always accompanied by music with complex auditory contents, remains\nchallenging and uninvestigated. Considering the intrinsic alignment between the\ncadent movement of dancer and music rhythm, we introduce MuDaR, a novel\nMusic-Dance Representation learning framework to perform the synchronization of\nmusic and dance rhythms both in explicit and implicit ways. Specifically, we\nderive the dance rhythms based on visual appearance and motion cues inspired by\nthe music rhythm analysis. Then the visual rhythms are temporally aligned with\nthe music counterparts, which are extracted by the amplitude of sound\nintensity. Meanwhile, we exploit the implicit coherence of rhythms implied in\naudio and visual streams by contrastive learning. The model learns the joint\nembedding by predicting the temporal consistency between audio-visual pairs.\nThe music-dance representation, together with the capability of detecting audio\nand visual rhythms, can further be applied to three downstream tasks: (a) dance\nclassification, (b) music-dance retrieval, and (c) music-dance retargeting.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms other\nself-supervised methods by a large margin.",

    "abstract": "Low-precision formats have recently driven major breakthroughs in neural\nnetwork (NN) training and inference by reducing the memory footprint of the NN\nmodels and improving the energy efficiency of the underlying hardware\narchitectures. Narrow integer data types have been vastly investigated for NN\ninference and have successfully been pushed to the extreme of ternary and\nbinary representations. In contrast, most training-oriented platforms use at\nleast 16-bit floating-point (FP) formats. Lower-precision data types such as\n8-bit FP formats and mixed-precision techniques have only recently been\nexplored in hardware implementations. We present MiniFloat-NN, a RISC-V\ninstruction set architecture extension for low-precision NN training, providing\nsupport for two 8-bit and two 16-bit FP formats and expanding operations. The\nextension includes sum-of-dot-product instructions that accumulate the result\nin a larger format and three-term additions in two variations: expanding and\nnon-expanding. We implement an ExSdotp unit to efficiently support in hardware\nboth instruction types. The fused nature of the ExSdotp module prevents\nprecision losses generated by the non-associativity of two consecutive FP\nadditions while saving around 30% of the area and critical path compared to a\ncascade of two expanding fused multiply-add units. We replicate the ExSdotp\nmodule in a SIMD wrapper and integrate it into an open-source floating-point\nunit, which, coupled to an open-source RISC-V core, lays the foundation for\nfuture scalable architectures targeting low-precision and mixed-precision NN\ntraining.

    "abstract": "The goal of a recommendation system is to model the relevance between each\nuser and each item through the user-item interaction history, so that maximize\nthe positive samples score and minimize negative samples. Currently, two\npopular loss functions are widely used to optimize recommender systems: the\npointwise and the pairwise. Although these loss functions are widely used,\nhowever, there are two problems. (1) These traditional loss functions do not\nfit the goals of recommendation systems adequately and utilize prior knowledge\ninformation sufficiently. (2) The slow convergence speed of these traditional\nloss functions makes the practical application of various recommendation models\ndifficult.\nTo address these issues, we propose a novel loss function named Supervised\nPersonalized Ranking (SPR) Based on Prior Knowledge. The proposed method\nimproves the BPR loss by exploiting the prior knowledge on the interaction\nhistory of each user or item in the raw data. Unlike BPR, instead of\nconstructing <user, positive item, negative item> triples, the proposed SPR\nconstructs <user, similar user, positive item, negative item> quadruples.\nAlthough SPR is very simple, it is very effective. Extensive experiments show\nthat our proposed SPR not only achieves better recommendation performance, but\nalso significantly accelerates the convergence speed, resulting in a\nsignificant reduction in the required training time.",

While\ncomputer graphics technology brings us a grand visual feast in the field of\ngames and movies, it may also be utilized by someone with bad intentions to\nguide public opinions and cause political crisis or social unrest. Therefore,\nhow to distinguish the computer-generated graphics (CG) from the photographs\n(PG) has become an important topic in the field of digital image forensics.\nThis paper proposes a dual stream convolutional neural network based on channel\njoint and softpool. The proposed network architecture includes a residual\nmodule for extracting image noise information and a joint channel information\nextraction module for capturing the shallow semantic information of image. In\naddition, we also design a residual structure to enhance feature extraction and\nreduce the loss of information in residual flow. The joint channel information\nextraction module can obtain the shallow semantic information of the input\nimage which can be used as the information supplement block of the residual\nmodule. The whole network uses SoftPool to reduce the information loss of\ndown-sampling for image. Finally, we fuse the two flows to get the\nclassification results.

The core step of any AIOps workflow is anomaly detection, typically\nperformed on high-volume heterogeneous data such as log messages (logs),\nmetrics (e.g., CPU utilization), and distributed traces. In this paper, we\npropose a method for reliable and practical anomaly detection from system logs.\nIt overcomes the common disadvantage of related works, i.e., the need for a\nlarge amount of manually labeled training data, by building an anomaly\ndetection model with log instructions from the source code of 1000+ GitHub\nprojects.

    "abstract": "When training a machine learning classifier on data where one of the classes\nis intrinsically rare, the classifier will often assign too few sources to the\nrare class. To address this, it is common to up-weight the examples of the rare\nclass to ensure it isn't ignored. It is also a frequent practice to train on\nrestricted data where the balance of source types is closer to equal for the\nsame reason. Here we show that these practices can bias the model toward\nover-assigning sources to the rare class. We also explore how to detect when\ntraining data bias has had a statistically significant impact on the trained\nmodel's predictions, and how to reduce the bias's impact. While the magnitude\nof the impact of the techniques developed here will vary with the details of\nthe application, for most cases it should be modest.

    "title": "Revisiting Pretraining Objectives for Tabular Deep Learning",
    "abstract": "Recent deep learning models for tabular data currently compete with the\ntraditional ML models based on decision trees (GBDT). Unlike GBDT, deep models\ncan additionally benefit from pretraining, which is a workhorse of DL for\nvision and NLP. For tabular problems, several pretraining methods were\nproposed, but it is not entirely clear if pretraining provides consistent\nnoticeable improvements and what method should be used, since the methods are\noften not compared to each other or comparison is limited to the simplest MLP\narchitectures.\nIn this work, we aim to identify the best practices to pretrain tabular DL\nmodels that can be universally applied to different datasets and architectures.\nAmong our findings, we show that using the object target labels during the\npretraining stage is beneficial for the downstream performance and advocate\nseveral target-aware pretraining objectives. Overall, our experiments\ndemonstrate that properly performed pretraining significantly increases the\nperformance of tabular DL models, which often leads to their superiority over\nGBDTs.",

One\nof such techniques is validation obligations that enable formalizing\nrequirements early in development to ensure their correctness.

Although initially\nproposed for safety properties, this paper shows how the technique of\nvalidation obligations enables us to also reason about security concerns\nthrough an example from the medical domain.",

    "abstract": "Explainable artificial intelligence is a research field that tries to provide\nmore transparency for autonomous intelligent systems. Explainability has been\nused, particularly in reinforcement learning and robotic scenarios, to better\nunderstand the robot decision-making process. Previous work, however, has been\nwidely focused on providing technical explanations that can be better\nunderstood by AI practitioners than non-expert end-users. In this work, we make\nuse of human-like explanations built from the probability of success to\ncomplete the goal that an autonomous robot shows after performing an action.\nThese explanations are intended to be understood by people who have no or very\nlittle experience with artificial intelligence methods. This paper presents a\nuser trial to study whether these explanations that focus on the probability an\naction has of succeeding in its goal constitute a suitable explanation for\nnon-expert end-users. The results obtained show that non-expert participants\nrate robot explanations that focus on the probability of success higher and\nwith less variance than technical explanations generated from Q-values, and\nalso favor counterfactual explanations over standalone explanations.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces an efficient patch-based computational module, coined\nEntropy-based Patch Encoder (EPE) module, for resource-constrained semantic\nsegmentation. The EPE module consists of three lightweight fully-convolutional\nencoders, each extracting features from image patches with a different amount\nof entropy. Patches with high entropy are being processed by the encoder with\nthe largest number of parameters, patches with moderate entropy are processed\nby the encoder with a moderate number of parameters, and patches with low\nentropy are processed by the smallest encoder. The intuition behind the module\nis the following: as patches with high entropy contain more information, they\nneed an encoder with more parameters, unlike low entropy patches, which can be\nprocessed using a small encoder. Consequently, processing part of the patches\nvia the smaller encoder can significantly reduce the computational cost of the\nmodule. Experiments show that EPE can boost the performance of existing\nreal-time semantic segmentation models with a slight increase in the\ncomputational cost. Specifically, EPE increases the mIOU performance of DFANet\nA by 0.9% with only 1.2% increase in the number of parameters and the mIOU\nperformance of EDANet by 1% with 10% increase of the model parameters.",

One combinatorial optimization problem that has been\ntackled with ML is the Job Shop scheduling Problem (JSP). Most of the recent\nworks focusing on the JSP and ML are based on Deep Reinforcement Learning\n(DRL), and only a few of them leverage supervised learning techniques. The\nrecurrent reasons for avoiding supervised learning seem to be the difficulty in\ncasting the right learning task, i.e., what is meaningful to predict, and how\nto obtain labels. Therefore, we first propose a novel supervised learning task\nthat aims at predicting the quality of machine permutations. Then, we design an\noriginal methodology to estimate this quality that allows to create an accurate\nsequential deep learning model (binary accuracy above 95%). Finally, we\nempirically demonstrate the value of predicting the quality of machine\npermutations by enhancing the performance of a simple Tabu Search algorithm\ninspired by the works in the literature.",

This is the only solution in the periodic orbit of the map $F$.\nFurther, when the degree of the minimal polynomial is of polynomial order in\nnumber of bits of the input of $F$ (called low complexity case), the solution\ncan be computed in polynomial time. The method of computation only uses the\nforward computations $F(y)$ for given $y$ which is why this is called a Black\nBox approach. Application of this approach is then shown for cryptanalysis of\nseveral maps arising in cryptographic primitives. It is shown how in the low\ncomplexity cases maps defined by block and stream ciphers can be inverted to\nfind the symmetric key under known plaintext attack. Then it is shown how RSA\nmap can be inverted to find the plaintext as well as an equivalent private key\nto break the RSA algorithm without factoring the modulus.

To address this bottleneck, an adaptive multi-grid RL\nframework is introduced which is inspired by principles of geometric multi-grid\nmethods used in iterative numerical algorithms. RL control policies are\ninitially learned using computationally efficient low fidelity simulations\nusing coarse grid discretization of the underlying partial differential\nequations (PDEs).

Our GD+Solver hybrid algorithm, called GDSolver, works as\nfollows: given a DNN $D$ as input, GDSolver invokes GD to partially train $D$\nuntil it gets stuck in a local minima, at which point GDSolver invokes an MILP\nsolver to exhaustively search a region of the loss landscape around the weight\nassignments of $D$'s final layer parameters with the goal of tunnelling through\nand escaping the local minima. The process is repeated until desired accuracy\nis achieved. In our experiments, we find that GDSolver not only scales well to\nadditional data and very large model sizes, but also outperforms all other\ncompeting methods in terms of rates of convergence and data efficiency. For\nregression tasks, GDSolver produced models that, on average, had 31.5% lower\nMSE in 48% less time, and for classification tasks on MNIST and CIFAR10,\nGDSolver was able to achieve the highest accuracy over all competing methods,\nusing only 50% of the training data that GD baselines required.",

The hereditary discrepancy of a set system, is\nthe maximum discrepancy over all set systems obtainable by deleting a subset of\nthe ground elements. While being polynomial time, Bansal's algorithms were not\npractical, with e.g. his algorithm for the hereditary setup running in time\n$\\Omega(m n^{4.5})$ for set systems with $m$ sets over a ground set of $n$\nelements. More efficient algorithms have since then been developed for general\nand sparse set systems, however, for the hereditary case, Bansal's algorithm\nremains state-of-the-art. In this work, we give a significantly faster\nalgorithm with hereditary guarantees, running in $O(mn^2\\lg(2 + m/n) + n^3)$\ntime. Our algorithm is based on new structural insights into set systems with\nbounded hereditary discrepancy. We also implement our algorithm and show\nexperimentally that it computes colorings that are significantly better than\nrandom and finishes in a reasonable amount of time, even on set systems with\nthousands of sets over a ground set of thousands of elements.",

This paper takes a step in the direction of reducing\nthe degree of subjectivity by proposing a methodology to support risk assessors\nwith an automatic review of the produced assessment. Our methodology starts\nfrom a controls-based assessment performed using well-known cybersecurity\nframeworks (e.g., ISO 27001, NIST) and maps security controls over\ninfrastructural aspects that can be assessed automatically (e.g., ICT devices,\norganization policies). Exploiting this mapping, the methodology suggests how\nto identify controls needing revision.

    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate novel algorithmic growth processes. In\nparticular, we propose three growth operations, full doubling, RC doubling and\ndoubling, and explore the algorithmic and structural properties of their\nresulting processes under a geometric setting. In terms of modeling, our system\nruns on a 2-dimensional grid and operates in discrete time-steps. The process\nbegins with an initial shape $S_I=S_0$ and, in every time-step $t \\geq 1$, by\napplying (in parallel) one or more growth operations of a specific type to the\ncurrent shape-instance $S_{t-1}$, generates the next instance $S_t$, always\nsatisfying $|S_t| > |S_{t-1}|$. Our goal is to characterize the classes of\nshapes that can be constructed in $O(\\log n)$ or polylog $n$ time-steps and\ndetermine whether a final shape $S_F$ can be constructed from an initial shape\n$S_I$ using a finite sequence of growth operations of a given type, called a\nconstructor of $S_F$.\nFor full doubling, in which, in every time-step, every node generates a new\nnode in a given direction, we completely characterize the structure of the\nclass of shapes that can be constructed from a given initial shape. For RC\ndoubling, in which complete columns or rows double, our main contribution is a\nlinear-time centralized algorithm that for any pair of shapes $S_I$, $S_F$\ndecides if $S_F$ can be constructed from $S_I$ and, if the answer is yes,\nreturns an $O(\\log n)$-time-step constructor of $S_F$ from $S_I$. For the most\ngeneral doubling operation, where up to individual nodes can double, we show\nthat some shapes cannot be constructed in sub-linear time-steps and give two\nuniversal constructors of any $S_F$ from a singleton $S_I$, which are efficient\n(i.e., up to polylogarithmic time-steps) for large classes of shapes. Both\nconstructors can be computed by polynomial-time centralized algorithms for any\nshape $S_F$.",

The increasing\npenetration of distributed renewable energy not only brings clean power but\nalso challenges the voltage regulation and energy-saving performance of CVR by\nintroducing high uncertainties to distribution systems. In most cases, the\nconventional robust optimization methods for CVR only provide conservative\nsolutions. To better consider the impacts of load and PV generation\nuncertainties on CVR implementation in distribution systems and provide less\nconservative solutions, this paper develops a data-based DRCC-CVR model with\ntractable reformulation and data enrichment method. Even though the\nuncertainties of load and photovoltaic (PV) can be captured by data, the\navailability of smart meters (SMs) and micro-phasor measurement units (PMUs) is\nrestricted by cost budget. The limited data access may hinder the performance\nof the proposed DRCC-CVR. Thus, we further present a data enrichment method to\nstatistically recover the high-resolution load and PV generation data from\nlow-resolution data with Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Markov Chain\n(MC) models, which can be used to construct a data-based moment ambiguity set\nof uncertainty distributions for the proposed DRCC-CVR. Finally, the nonlinear\npower flow and voltage dependant load models and DRCC with moment-based\nambiguity set are reformulated to be computationally tractable and tested on a\nreal distribution feeder in Midwest U.

    "abstract": "Night imaging with modern smartphone cameras is troublesome due to low photon\ncount and unavoidable noise in the imaging system. Directly adjusting exposure\ntime and ISO ratings cannot obtain sharp and noise-free images at the same time\nin low-light conditions. Though many methods have been proposed to enhance\nnoisy or blurry night images, their performances on real-world night photos are\nstill unsatisfactory due to two main reasons: 1) Limited information in a\nsingle image and 2) Domain gap between synthetic training images and real-world\nphotos (e.g., differences in blur area and resolution). To exploit the\ninformation from successive long- and short-exposure images, we propose a\nlearning-based pipeline to fuse them. A D2HNet framework is developed to\nrecover a high-quality image by deblurring and enhancing a long-exposure image\nunder the guidance of a short-exposure image. To shrink the domain gap, we\nleverage a two-phase DeblurNet-EnhanceNet architecture, which performs accurate\nblur removal on a fixed low resolution so that it is able to handle large\nranges of blur in different resolution inputs. In addition, we synthesize a\nD2-Dataset from HD videos and experiment on it.

This paper has\nproposed a new resource management framework for backscatter-aided cooperative\nNOMA communication in upcoming 6G networks. In particular, the proposed work\nhas simultaneously optimized the base station's transmit power, relaying node,\nthe reflection coefficient of the backscatter tag, and time allocation under\nimperfect successive interference cancellation to maximize the sum rate of the\nsystem.

When the performance of the proposed technique is compared to a\nbrute-forcing search technique that guarantees optimal solution however, is\nvery time-consuming, it was seen that the gap in performance is actually 0\\%.\nHence, the proposed framework has provided performance equal to a cumbersome\nbrute-force search technique while offering much less complexity.

In our\nprevious work, we proposed a paradigm known as Bundling Learning (BL) to\naddress the above problem. The BL paradigm bundles the two NER paradigms,\nenabling NER models to jointly tune their parameters by weighted summing each\nparadigm's training loss. However, three critical issues remain unresolved:\nWhen does BL work? Why does BL work? Can BL enhance the existing\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) NER models? To address the first two issues, we\nimplement three NER models, involving a sequence labeling-based model--SeqNER,\na span-based NER model--SpanNER, and BL-NER that bundles SeqNER and SpanNER\ntogether. We draw two conclusions regarding the two issues based on the\nexperimental results on eleven NER datasets from five domains. We then apply BL\nto five existing SOTA NER models to investigate the third issue, consisting of\nthree sequence labeling-based models and two span-based models. Experimental\nresults indicate that BL consistently enhances their performance, suggesting\nthat it is possible to construct a new SOTA NER system by incorporating BL into\nthe current SOTA system.

In this paper we introduce a novel class of soft haptic displays\nthat wrap around the robot arm, adding signals without affecting interaction.\nWe first design a pneumatic actuation array that remains flexible in mounting.\nWe then develop single and multi-dimensional versions of this wrapped haptic\ndisplay, and explore human perception of the rendered signals during\npsychophysic tests and robot learning.

When\nphysically teaching robot arms, humans leverage the single- and\nmulti-dimensional feedback to provide better demonstrations than with visual\nfeedback: our wrapped haptic display decreases teaching time while increasing\ndemonstration quality. This improvement depends on the location and\ndistribution of the wrapped haptic display. You can see videos of our device\nand experiments here: https://youtu.be/yPcMGeqsjdM",

    "abstract": "In this study, we propose feature extraction for multimodal meme\nclassification using Deep Learning approaches. A meme is usually a photo or\nvideo with text shared by the young generation on social media platforms that\nexpresses a culturally relevant idea. Since they are an efficient way to\nexpress emotions and feelings, a good classifier that can classify the\nsentiment behind the meme is important. To make the learning process more\nefficient, reduce the likelihood of overfitting, and improve the\ngeneralizability of the model, one needs a good approach for joint feature\nextraction from all modalities. In this work, we proposed to use different\nmultimodal neural network approaches for multimodal feature extraction and use\nthe extracted features to train a classifier to identify the sentiment in a\nmeme.",

    "abstract": "Reachability analysis is a widely used method to analyze the safety of a\nHuman-in-the-Loop Cyber Physical System (HiLCPS). This strategy allows the\nHiLCPS to respond against an imminent threat in advance by predicting reachable\nstates of the system. However, it could lead to an unnecessarily conservative\nreachable set if the prediction only relies on the system dynamics without\nexplicitly considering human behavior, and thus the risk might be\noverestimated. To reduce the conservativeness of the reachability analysis, we\npresent a state prediction method which takes into account a stochastic human\nbehavior model represented as a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). In this paper, we\nfocus on the multi-rotor in a near-collision situation. The stochastic human\nbehavior model is trained using experimental data to represent human operators'\nevasive maneuver. Then, we can retrieve a human control input probability\ndistribution from the trained stochastic human behavior model using the\nGaussian Mixture Regression (GMR). The proposed algorithm predicts the\nprobability distribution of the multi-rotor's future state based on the given\ndynamics and the retrieved human control input probability distribution.\nBesides, the proposed state prediction method considers the uncertainty of the\ninitial state modeled as a GMM, which yields more robust performance.

    "abstract": "Synthesizing a realistic image from textual description is a major challenge\nin computer vision. Current text to image synthesis approaches falls short of\nproducing a highresolution image that represent a text descriptor. Most\nexisting studies rely either on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or\nVariational Auto Encoders (VAEs). GANs has the capability to produce sharper\nimages but lacks the diversity of outputs, whereas VAEs are good at producing a\ndiverse range of outputs, but the images generated are often blurred. Taking\ninto account the relative advantages of both GANs and VAEs, we proposed a new\nstacked Conditional VAE (CVAE) and Conditional GAN (CGAN) network architecture\nfor synthesizing images conditioned on a text description. This study uses\nConditional VAEs as an initial generator to produce a high-level sketch of the\ntext descriptor. This high-level sketch output from first stage and a text\ndescriptor is used as an input to the conditional GAN network. The second stage\nGAN produces a 256x256 high resolution image. The proposed architecture\nbenefits from a conditioning augmentation and a residual block on the\nConditional GAN network to achieve the results. Multiple experiments were\nconducted using CUB and Oxford-102 dataset and the result of the proposed\napproach is compared against state-ofthe-art techniques such as StackGAN.

    "abstract": "While fine-tuning pre-trained networks has become a popular way to train\nimage segmentation models, such backbone networks for image segmentation are\nfrequently pre-trained using image classification source datasets, e.g.,\nImageNet. Though image classification datasets could provide the backbone\nnetworks with rich visual features and discriminative ability, they are\nincapable of fully pre-training the target model (i.e., backbone+segmentation\nmodules) in an end-to-end manner. The segmentation modules are left to random\ninitialization in the fine-tuning process due to the lack of segmentation\nlabels in classification datasets. In our work, we propose a method that\nleverages Pseudo Semantic Segmentation Labels (PSSL), to enable the end-to-end\npre-training for image segmentation models based on classification datasets.\nPSSL was inspired by the observation that the explanation results of\nclassification models, obtained through explanation algorithms such as CAM,\nSmoothGrad and LIME, would be close to the pixel clusters of visual objects.\nSpecifically, PSSL is obtained for each image by interpreting the\nclassification results and aggregating an ensemble of explanations queried from\nmultiple classifiers to lower the bias caused by single models. With PSSL for\nevery image of ImageNet, the proposed method leverages a weighted segmentation\nlearning procedure to pre-train the segmentation network en masse. Experiment\nresults show that, with ImageNet accompanied by PSSL as the source dataset, the\nproposed end-to-end pre-training strategy successfully boosts the performance\nof various segmentation models, i.e., PSPNet-ResNet50, DeepLabV3-ResNet50, and\nOCRNet-HRNetW18, on a number of segmentation tasks, such as CamVid, VOC-A,\nVOC-C, ADE20K, and CityScapes, with significant improvements.

    "abstract": "Vision transformers (ViTs) have pushed the state-of-the-art for various\nvisual recognition tasks by patch-wise image tokenization followed by stacked\nself-attention operations. Employing self-attention modules results in a\nquadratic complexity in both computation and memory usage. Various attempts on\napproximating the self-attention computation with linear complexity have thus\nbeen made in Natural Language Processing. However, an in-depth analysis in this\nwork reveals that they are either theoretically flawed or empirically\nineffective for visual recognition. We identify that their limitations are\nrooted in retaining the softmax self-attention during approximations.\nSpecifically, conventional self-attention is computed by normalizing the scaled\ndot-product between token feature vectors. Preserving the softmax operation\nchallenges any subsequent linearization efforts. Under this insight, a\nSOftmax-Free Transformer (abbreviated as SOFT) is proposed for the first time.\nTo eliminate the softmax operator in self-attention, a Gaussian kernel function\nis adopted to replace the dot-product similarity. This enables a full\nself-attention matrix to be approximated via a low-rank matrix decomposition.\nThe robustness of our approximation is achieved by calculating its\nMoore-Penrose inverse using a Newton-Raphson method. Further, an efficient\nsymmetric normalization is introduced on the low-rank self-attention for\nenhancing model generalizability and transferability. Extensive experiments on\nImageNet, COCO and ADE20K show that our SOFT significantly improves the\ncomputational efficiency of existing ViT variants.

Clinical diagnosis of\nmonkeypox in an early stage is challenging due to its similarity with\nchickenpox and measles. In cases where the confirmatory Polymerase Chain\nReaction (PCR) tests are not readily available, computer-assisted detection of\nmonkeypox lesions could be beneficial for surveillance and rapid identification\nof suspected cases. Deep learning methods have been found effective in the\nautomated detection of skin lesions, provided that sufficient training examples\nare available. However, as of now, such datasets are not available for the\nmonkeypox disease. In the current study, we first develop the ``Monkeypox Skin\nLesion Dataset (MSLD)\" consisting skin lesion images of monkeypox, chickenpox,\nand measles. The images are mainly collected from websites, news portals, and\npublicly accessible case reports. Data augmentation is used to increase the\nsample size, and a 3-fold cross-validation experiment is set up. In the next\nstep, several pre-trained deep learning models, namely, VGG-16, ResNet50, and\nInceptionV3 are employed to classify monkeypox and other diseases. An ensemble\nof the three models is also developed. ResNet50 achieves the best overall\naccuracy of $82.96(\\pm4.57\\%)$, while VGG16 and the ensemble system achieved\naccuracies of $81.48(\\pm6.87\\%)$ and $79.26(\\pm1.05\\%)$, respectively.

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, Fog\ncomputing, mobile edge computing and wireless grids has resulted in the\nwidespread deployment of relatively immature technology. These technologies,\nwhich will primarily use 5G wireless communication networks, are becoming\npopular because they can be deployed quickly with little infrastructure and\nlends themselves to environments utilizing numerous internet connected devices\n(ICD). Because of the threat of exploitation, these networks have to be\nprotected by a robust security architecture due to these technologies being\nplagued with security problems. The authentication of smart ICDs to IoT\nnetworks is a critical mechanism for achieving security on these new\ninformation system platforms. This article identifies an authentication process\nrequired for these ICDs, which will need to prove their identity to\nauthenticate to an IoT fog-mobile edge computing (FMEC) cloud network through a\nwireless grid authentication process. The purpose of this article is to\nhypothesize a generic authentication methodology for these FMEC clouds uses in\nan IoT architecture. The proposed methodology, called wg-IoT, must include the\nintegration of Fog computing, wireless grids and mobile edge computing clouds\nto create this new IoT architecture. An authentication process developed from\nthe resource sharing protocol (RSP) from a wireless grid is first developed and\nproposed for the authentication of ICDs. The wireless grid core components must\nbe embedded in IoT devices or sensors depending on their capability to handle\nfive primary functions: management of identification [ID] and presence,\npermissions management, data transferability, application-programming interface\n[API] and security.",

    "abstract": "We develop data-driven models to predict when a robot should feed during\nsocial dining scenarios. Being able to eat independently with friends and\nfamily is considered one of the most memorable and important activities for\npeople with mobility limitations. Robots can potentially help with this\nactivity but robot-assisted feeding is a multi-faceted problem with challenges\nin bite acquisition, bite timing, and bite transfer. Bite timing in particular\nbecomes uniquely challenging in social dining scenarios due to the possibility\nof interrupting a social human-robot group interaction during commensality. Our\nkey insight is that bite timing strategies that take into account the delicate\nbalance of social cues can lead to seamless interactions during robot-assisted\nfeeding in a social dining scenario. We approach this problem by collecting a\nmultimodal Human-Human Commensality Dataset (HHCD) containing 30 groups of\nthree people eating together. We use this dataset to analyze human-human\ncommensality behaviors and develop bite timing prediction models in social\ndining scenarios. We also transfer these models to human-robot commensality\nscenarios. Our user studies show that prediction improves when our algorithm\nuses multimodal social signaling cues between diners to model bite timing. The\nHHCD dataset, videos of user studies, and code will be publicly released after\nacceptance.",

Traditionally, the decision-maker's expected performance has been\ncompared to the expected performance of the \\emph{prophet}, i.e., the expected\noffline optimum. We refer to this measure as the \\textit{Ratio of Expectations}\n(or, in short, \\textsf{RoE}). However, a major limitation of the \\textsf{RoE}\nmeasure is that it only gives a guarantee against what the optimum would be on\naverage, while, in theory, algorithms still might perform poorly compared to\nthe realized ex-post optimal value.\nHence, we study alternative performance measures. In particular, we suggest\nthe \\textit{Expected Ratio} (or, in short, \\textsf{EoR}), which is the\nexpectation of the ratio between the value of the algorithm and the value of\nthe prophet. This measure yields desirable guarantees, e.g., a constant\n\\textsf{EoR} implies achieving a constant fraction of the ex-post offline\noptimum with constant probability. Moreover, in the single-choice setting, we\nshow that the \\textsf{EoR} is equivalent (in the worst case) to the probability\nof selecting the maximum, a well-studied measure in the literature. This is no\nlonger the case for combinatorial constraints (beyond single-choice), which is\nthe main focus of this paper.\nOur main goal is to understand the relation between \\textsf{RoE} and\n\\textsf{EoR} in combinatorial settings. Specifically, we establish a two-way\nblack-box reduction: for every feasibility constraint, the \\textsf{RoE} and the\n\\textsf{EoR} are at most a constant factor apart. This implies a wealth of\n\\textsf{EoR} results in multiple settings where \\textsf{RoE} results are known.",

Hence, maximizing a submodular function subject to various\nconstraints can be found at the heart of many of those applications. On a high\nlevel, submodular maximization aims to select a group of most representative\nitems (e.g., data points).

To this end, we develop the first constant-factor\napproximation algorithm for this problem.

    "abstract": "Time-based dynamic models of cascading failures have been recognized as one\nof the most comprehensive methods of representing detailed cascading\ninformation and are often used for benchmarking and validation. This paper\nprovides an overview of the progress in the field of dynamic analysis of\ncascading failures in power systems and outlines the benefits and challenges of\ndynamic simulations in future grids. The benefits include the ability to\ncapture temporal characteristics of system dynamics and provide timing\ninformation to facilitate control actions for blackout mitigation. The greatest\nbarriers to dynamic modelling of cascading failures are the computational\nburden, and the extensive but often unavailable data requirements for dynamic\nrepresentation of a power system. These factors are discussed in detail in this\npaper and the need for in-depth research into dynamic modelling of cascading\nfailures is highlighted. Furthermore, case studies of dynamic cascading\nsimulation of 200-bus and 2000-bus benchmark systems provide initial guidance\nfor the selection of critical parameters to enhance simulation efficiency.\nFinally, cross-validation and comparison against a quasi-steady state DC power\nflow model is performed, with various metrics compared.",

The analysis\nobserves that the languages closeness can not be truly estimated by the volume\nof overlapping phonemes set. Entropy analysis of the proposed mapping networks\nexhibits that a language with lesser overlap can be more amenable to\ncross-lingual transfer, and hence more beneficial in the multilingual setup.\nFinally, the proposed posterior transformation approach is leveraged to fuse\nmonolingual models for a target language.

    "abstract": "Humans can leverage physical interaction to teach robot arms. This physical\ninteraction takes multiple forms depending on the task, the user, and what the\nrobot has learned so far. State-of-the-art approaches focus on learning from a\nsingle modality, or combine multiple interaction types by assuming that the\nrobot has prior information about the human's intended task. By contrast, in\nthis paper we introduce an algorithmic formalism that unites learning from\ndemonstrations, corrections, and preferences. Our approach makes no assumptions\nabout the tasks the human wants to teach the robot; instead, we learn a reward\nmodel from scratch by comparing the human's inputs to nearby alternatives. We\nfirst derive a loss function that trains an ensemble of reward models to match\nthe human's demonstrations, corrections, and preferences. The type and order of\nfeedback is up to the human teacher: we enable the robot to collect this\nfeedback passively or actively. We then apply constrained optimization to\nconvert our learned reward into a desired robot trajectory. Through simulations\nand a user study we demonstrate that our proposed approach more accurately\nlearns manipulation tasks from physical human interaction than existing\nbaselines, particularly when the robot is faced with new or unexpected\nobjectives.

    "abstract": "If a disturbance rocks a low-inertia power system, the frequency decline may\nbe too rapid to arrest before it triggers undesirable responses from generators\nand loads. In the worst case, this instability could lead to blackout and major\nequipment damage. Electric utilities, to combat this, study inertia adequacy in\nsystems that are particularly vulnerable. This process, involving detailed\ntransient simulations, usually leads to a notion of a system-wide inertia\nfloor. Ongoing questions in this analysis are in how to set the inertial floor\nand to what extent the location of frequency control resources matters. This\npaper proposes a new analysis technique that quantifies theoretical locational\nrate of change of frequency (ROCOF) as a computationally efficient screening\nalgorithm scalable to large systems. An additional challenge in moving this\narea forward is the lack of high-quality, public benchmark dynamics cases.

Along\nwith the development of DNNs, the generalization performance converges to the\nstate-of-the-art and it becomes difficult to evaluate DNNs solely based on this\nmetric. The robustness against adversarial attack has been used as an\nadditional metric to evaluate DNNs by measuring their vulnerability. However,\nfew studies have been performed to analyze the adversarial robustness in terms\nof the geometry in DNNs. In this work, we perform an empirical study to analyze\nthe internal properties of DNNs that affect model robustness under adversarial\nattacks. In particular, we propose the novel concept of the Populated Region\nSet (PRS), where training samples are populated more frequently, to represent\nthe internal properties of DNNs in a practical setting. From systematic\nexperiments with the proposed concept, we provide empirical evidence to\nvalidate that a low PRS ratio has a strong relationship with the adversarial\nrobustness of DNNs.

Learning the\ndynamics of signed networks is thus crucial to effectively predict the sign and\nstrength of future links. Existing works model either signed networks or\ndynamic networks but not both together. In this work, we study dynamic signed\nnetworks where links are both signed and evolving with time. Our model learns a\nSigned link's Evolution using Memory modules and Balanced Aggregation (hence,\nthe name SEMBA). Each node maintains two separate memory encodings for positive\nand negative interactions. On the arrival of a new edge, each interacting node\naggregates this signed information with its memories while exploiting balance\ntheory. Node embeddings are generated using updated memories, which are then\nused to train for multiple downstream tasks, including link sign prediction and\nlink weight prediction. Our results show that SEMBA outperforms all the\nbaselines on the task of sign prediction by achieving up to an 8% increase in\nthe AUC and up to a 50% reduction in FPR.

    "title": "Binary Iterative Hard Thresholding Converges with Optimal Number of  Measurements for 1-Bit Compressed Sensing",
    "abstract": "Compressed sensing has been a very successful high-dimensional signal\nacquisition and recovery technique that relies on linear operations. However,\nthe actual measurements of signals have to be quantized before storing or\nprocessing. 1(One)-bit compressed sensing is a heavily quantized version of\ncompressed sensing, where each linear measurement of a signal is reduced to\njust one bit: the sign of the measurement. Once enough of such measurements are\ncollected, the recovery problem in 1-bit compressed sensing aims to find the\noriginal signal with as much accuracy as possible. The recovery problem is\nrelated to the traditional \"halfspace-learning\" problem in learning theory.\nFor recovery of sparse vectors, a popular reconstruction method from 1-bit\nmeasurements is the binary iterative hard thresholding (BIHT) algorithm. The\nalgorithm is a simple projected sub-gradient descent method, and is known to\nconverge well empirically, despite the nonconvexity of the problem. The\nconvergence property of BIHT was not theoretically justified, except with an\nexorbitantly large number of measurements (i.e., a number of measurement\ngreater than $\\max\\{k^{10}, 24^{48}, k^{3.5}/\\epsilon\\}$, where $k$ is the\nsparsity, $\\epsilon$ denotes the approximation error, and even this expression\nhides other factors). In this paper we show that the BIHT algorithm converges\nwith only $\\tilde{O}(\\frac{k}{\\epsilon})$ measurements. Note that, this\ndependence on $k$ and $\\epsilon$ is optimal for any recovery method in 1-bit\ncompressed sensing. With this result, to the best of our knowledge, BIHT is the\nonly practical and efficient (polynomial time) algorithm that requires the\noptimal number of measurements in all parameters (both $k$ and $\\epsilon$).\nThis is also an example of a gradient descent algorithm converging to the\ncorrect solution for a nonconvex problem, under suitable structural conditions.",

    "abstract": "Due to the costliness of labelled data in real-world applications,\nsemi-supervised object detectors, underpinned by pseudo labelling, are\nappealing. However, handling confusing samples is nontrivial: discarding\nvaluable confusing samples would compromise the model generalisation while\nusing them for training would exacerbate the confirmation bias issue caused by\ninevitable mislabelling. To solve this problem, this paper proposes to use\nconfusing samples proactively without label correction. Specifically, a virtual\ncategory (VC) is assigned to each confusing sample such that they can safely\ncontribute to the model optimisation even without a concrete label. It is\nattributed to specifying the embedding distance between the training sample and\nthe virtual category as the lower bound of the inter-class distance. Moreover,\nwe also modify the localisation loss to allow high-quality boundaries for\nlocation regression. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed VC\nlearning significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art, especially with small\namounts of available labels.",

    "abstract": "Creating high-quality articulated 3D models of animals is challenging either\nvia manual creation or using 3D scanning tools. Therefore, techniques to\nreconstruct articulated 3D objects from 2D images are crucial and highly\nuseful. In this work, we propose a practical problem setting to estimate 3D\npose and shape of animals given only a few (10-30) in-the-wild images of a\nparticular animal species (say, horse). Contrary to existing works that rely on\npre-defined template shapes, we do not assume any form of 2D or 3D ground-truth\nannotations, nor do we leverage any multi-view or temporal information.\nMoreover, each input image ensemble can contain animal instances with varying\nposes, backgrounds, illuminations, and textures. Our key insight is that 3D\nparts have much simpler shape compared to the overall animal and that they are\nrobust w.r.t. animal pose articulations. Following these insights, we propose\nLASSIE, a novel optimization framework which discovers 3D parts in a\nself-supervised manner with minimal user intervention. A key driving force\nbehind LASSIE is the enforcing of 2D-3D part consistency using self-supervisory\ndeep features. Experiments on Pascal-Part and self-collected in-the-wild animal\ndatasets demonstrate considerably better 3D reconstructions as well as both 2D\nand 3D part discovery compared to prior arts.

    "abstract": "In this paper we introduce a method for performance quantification of\nflexibility aggregation in flexibility coordination schemes (FCS), with a focus\non privacy preserving hierarchical FCS. The quantification is based on two\nperformance metrics: The aggregation error and the aggregation efficiency. We\npresent the simulation framework and the modelling of one complex type of\nflexibility providing units (FPUs), namely energy storage systems (ESS). ESS\ncause intertemporal constraints for flexibility coordination that lead to\naggregation errors in case flexibility is aggregated from heterogeneous groups\nof FPUs. We identify one parameter responsible for the aggregation error to be\nthe power-to-energy ratio of the ESS. A grouping of FPUs using similarity in\ntheir power-to-energy ratios is shown to improve the coordination performance.\nAdditionally, we describe the influence of flexibility demand timeseries on the\naggregation error, concluding that future assessments of aggregation errors\nshould consider multiple representative demand timeseries, which is a\nnon-trivial task.

Input\nadaptation by DDA is more robust than prior model adaptation approaches across\na variety of corruptions, architectures, and data regimes on the ImageNet-C\nbenchmark.

We focus on robust optimal well\ncontrol problem which is a subject of intensive research activities in the\nfield of subsurface reservoir management. For this problem, the system is\npartially observed since the data is only available at well locations.\nFurthermore, the model parameters are highly uncertain due to sparsity of\navailable field data. In principle, RL algorithms are capable of learning\noptimal action policies -- a map from states to actions -- to maximize a\nnumerical reward signal. In deep RL, this mapping from state to action is\nparameterized using a deep neural network. In the RL formulation of the robust\noptimal well control problem, the states are represented by saturation and\npressure values at well locations while the actions represent the valve\nopenings controlling the flow through wells. The numerical reward refers to the\ntotal sweep efficiency and the uncertain model parameter is the subsurface\npermeability field. The model parameter uncertainties are handled by\nintroducing a domain randomisation scheme that exploits cluster analysis on its\nuncertainty distribution.

Law\nenforcement agencies benefit from forensic tools that perform authorship\nanalysis, in order to identify and profile users based on their textual\ncontent. However, authorship analysis has been traditionally studied using\ncorpora featuring literary texts such as fragments from novels or fan fiction,\nwhich may not be suitable in a cybercrime context. Moreover, the few works that\nemploy authorship analysis tools for cybercrime prevention usually employ\nad-hoc experimental setups and datasets. To address these issues, we release\nVeriDark: a benchmark comprised of three large scale authorship verification\ndatasets and one authorship identification dataset obtained from user activity\nfrom either Dark Web related Reddit communities or popular illicit Dark Web\nmarket forums. We evaluate competitive NLP baselines on the three datasets and\nperform an analysis of the predictions to better understand the limitations of\nsuch approaches. We make the datasets and baselines publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/bit-ml/VeriDark",

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection methods strive to discover patterns that differ from the\nnorm in a semantic way. This goal is ambiguous as a data point differing from\nthe norm by an attribute e.g., age, race or gender, may be considered anomalous\nby some operators while others may consider this attribute irrelevant. Breaking\nfrom previous research, we present a new anomaly detection method that allows\noperators to exclude an attribute from being considered as relevant for anomaly\ndetection. Our approach then learns representations which do not contain\ninformation over the nuisance attributes. Anomaly scoring is performed using a\ndensity-based approach. Importantly, our approach does not require specifying\nthe attributes that are relevant for detecting anomalies, which is typically\nimpossible in anomaly detection, but only attributes to ignore. An empirical\ninvestigation is presented verifying the effectiveness of our approach.",

    "title": "Bridging the Gap between Object and Image-level Representations for  Open-Vocabulary Detection",
    "abstract": "Existing open-vocabulary object detectors typically enlarge their vocabulary\nsizes by leveraging different forms of weak supervision. This helps generalize\nto novel objects at inference. Two popular forms of weak-supervision used in\nopen-vocabulary detection (OVD) include pretrained CLIP model and image-level\nsupervision. We note that both these modes of supervision are not optimally\naligned for the detection task: CLIP is trained with image-text pairs and lacks\nprecise localization of objects while the image-level supervision has been used\nwith heuristics that do not accurately specify local object regions. In this\nwork, we propose to address this problem by performing object-centric alignment\nof the language embeddings from the CLIP model. Furthermore, we visually ground\nthe objects with only image-level supervision using a pseudo-labeling process\nthat provides high-quality object proposals and helps expand the vocabulary\nduring training. We establish a bridge between the above two object-alignment\nstrategies via a novel weight transfer function that aggregates their\ncomplimentary strengths. In essence, the proposed model seeks to minimize the\ngap between object and image-centric representations in the OVD setting. On the\nCOCO benchmark, our proposed approach achieves 40.3 AP50 on novel classes, an\nabsolute 11.9 gain over the previous best performance.For LVIS, we surpass the\nstate-of-the-art ViLD model by 5.0 mask AP for rare categories and 3.4 overall.\nCode: https://bit.ly/3byZoQp.",

In this paper, we introduce a setting in which to\nstudy multi-modal object localization in 3D virtual environments. An object is\ndropped somewhere in a room. An embodied robot agent, equipped with a camera\nand microphone, must determine what object has been dropped -- and where -- by\ncombining audio and visual signals with knowledge of the underlying physics. To\nstudy this problem, we have generated a large-scale dataset -- the Fallen\nObjects dataset -- that includes 8000 instances of 30 physical object\ncategories in 64 rooms. The dataset uses the ThreeDWorld platform which can\nsimulate physics-based impact sounds and complex physical interactions between\nobjects in a photorealistic setting.

The collection of associated techniques are\ncalled, tensor network methods: the subject developed independently in several\ndistinct fields of study, which have more recently become interrelated through\nthe language of tensor networks. The tantamount questions in the field relate\nto expressability of tensor networks and the reduction of computational\noverheads. A merger of tensor networks with machine learning is natural.

    "abstract": "Deep learning has had tremendous success at learning low-dimensional\nrepresentations of high-dimensional data. This success would be impossible if\nthere was no hidden low-dimensional structure in data of interest; this\nexistence is posited by the manifold hypothesis, which states that the data\nlies on an unknown manifold of low intrinsic dimension. In this paper, we argue\nthat this hypothesis does not properly capture the low-dimensional structure\ntypically present in data. Assuming the data lies on a single manifold implies\nintrinsic dimension is identical across the entire data space, and does not\nallow for subregions of this space to have a different number of factors of\nvariation. To address this deficiency, we put forth the union of manifolds\nhypothesis, which accommodates the existence of non-constant intrinsic\ndimensions. We empirically verify this hypothesis on commonly-used image\ndatasets, finding that indeed, intrinsic dimension should be allowed to vary.\nWe also show that classes with higher intrinsic dimensions are harder to\nclassify, and how this insight can be used to improve classification accuracy.\nWe then turn our attention to the impact of this hypothesis in the context of\ndeep generative models (DGMs). Most current DGMs struggle to model datasets\nwith several connected components and/or varying intrinsic dimensions. To\ntackle these shortcomings, we propose clustered DGMs, where we first cluster\nthe data and then train a DGM on each cluster. We show that clustered DGMs can\nmodel multiple connected components with different intrinsic dimensions, and\nempirically outperform their non-clustered counterparts without increasing\ncomputational requirements.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based virtual staining was developed to introduce image\ncontrast to label-free tissue sections, digitally matching the histological\nstaining, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and destructive to tissue.\nStandard virtual staining requires high autofocusing precision during the whole\nslide imaging of label-free tissue, which consumes a significant portion of the\ntotal imaging time and can lead to tissue photodamage. Here, we introduce a\nfast virtual staining framework that can stain defocused autofluorescence\nimages of unlabeled tissue, achieving equivalent performance to virtual\nstaining of in-focus label-free images, also saving significant imaging time by\nlowering the microscope's autofocusing precision. This framework incorporates a\nvirtual-autofocusing neural network to digitally refocus the defocused images\nand then transforms the refocused images into virtually stained images using a\nsuccessive network. These cascaded networks form a collaborative inference\nscheme: the virtual staining model regularizes the virtual-autofocusing network\nthrough a style loss during the training. To demonstrate the efficacy of this\nframework, we trained and blindly tested these networks using human lung\ntissue. Using 4x fewer focus points with 2x lower focusing precision, we\nsuccessfully transformed the coarsely-focused autofluorescence images into\nhigh-quality virtually stained H&E images, matching the standard virtual\nstaining framework that used finely-focused autofluorescence input images.\nWithout sacrificing the staining quality, this framework decreases the total\nimage acquisition time needed for virtual staining of a label-free whole-slide\nimage (WSI) by ~32%, together with a ~89% decrease in the autofocusing time,\nand has the potential to eliminate the laborious and costly histochemical\nstaining process in pathology.",

    "abstract": "Most parts of Africa's infrastructure are yet to be built. Where and how\nthese new buildings are constructed matters since today's decisions will last\nfor decades. The resulting morphology of cities has lasting implications for a\ncity's metabolism and energy needs. Estimating and projecting these needs has\nalways been challenging in Africa due to the lack of data. Yet, given the\nsweeping urbanisation expected in Africa over the next three decades, this\nobstacle needs to be overcome to guide cities towards a trajectory of\nsustainability and resiliency. Based on the location and surface of nearly 200\nmillion buildings on the continent, we estimate the inter-building distance of\nalmost six thousand cities. Satellite imagery enables the construction of urban\nform indicators to compare African cities' elongation, sprawl and emptiness. We\nestablish the BASE model, where the mean distance between buildings is a\nfunctional relation to the number of Buildings and their average Area, as well\nas the Sprawl and the Elongation of its spatial arrangement. The mean distance\nbetween structures in cities -- our proxy for its energy demands related to\nmobility -- grows faster than the square root of its population, resulting from\nthe combined impact of a sublinear growth in the number of buildings and a\nsublinear increase in building size and sprawl. We show that when a city\ndoubles its population, it triples the energy demand related to commutes.",

Fabrication of real-world computing devices requires\nthat the nanowires are deposited sequentially, leading to stacking of the wires\non top of each other. However, most simulations of computational tasks using\nthese systems treat the nanowires as 1D objects lying in a perfectly 2D plane -\nthe effect of stacking on RC performance has not yet been established. Here we\nuse detailed simulations to compare the performance of perfectly 2D and\nquasi-3D (stacked) networks of nanowires in two tasks: memory capacity and\nnonlinear transformation. We also show that our model of the junctions between\nnanowires is general enough to describe a wide range of memristive networks,\nand consider the impact of physically realistic electrode configurations on\nperformance. We show that the various networks and configurations have a\nstrikingly similar performance in RC tasks, which is surprising given their\nradically different topologies. Our results show that networks with an\nexperimentally achievable number of electrodes perform close to the upper\nbounds achievable when using the information from every wire. However, we also\nshow important differences, in particular that the quasi-3D networks are more\nresilient to changes in the input parameters, generalizing better to noisy\ntraining data.

Additionally, the influence of\ncoupling interactions between nodes further complicates the isolation of local\nnode dynamics. Given the architectural similarities between dynamical networks\nand recurrent neural networks (RNN), we propose a network inference method\nbased on the backpropagation through time (BPTT) algorithm commonly used to\ntrain recurrent neural networks. This method aims to simultaneously infer both\nthe connectivity structure and local node dynamics purely from observation of\nnode states. An approximation of local node dynamics is first constructed using\na neural network.

We study\na variational Bayes (VB) inference algorithm based on a non-traditional quantum\nannealing approach -- referred to as quantum annealing variational Bayes (QAVB)\ninference -- and show that there is indeed a quantum advantage to QAVB over its\nclassical counterparts. In particular, we show that such better performance is\nrooted in key concepts from quantum mechanics: (i) the ground state of the\nHamiltonian of a quantum system -- defined from the given variational Bayes\n(VB) problem -- corresponds to an optimal solution for the minimization problem\nof the variational free energy at very low temperatures; (ii) such a ground\nstate can be achieved by a technique paralleling the quantum annealing process;\nand (iii) starting from this ground state, the optimal solution to the VB\nproblem can be achieved by increasing the heat bath temperature to unity, and\nthereby avoiding local minima introduced by spontaneous symmetry breaking\nobserved in classical physics based VB algorithms.

    "abstract": "Atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs) extracted from satellite imagery are the\nonly wind observations with good global coverage. They are important features\nfor feeding numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. Several Bayesian models\nhave been proposed to estimate AMVs. Although critical for correct assimilation\ninto NWP models, very few methods provide a thorough characterization of the\nestimation errors. The difficulty of estimating errors stems from the\nspecificity of the posterior distribution, which is both very high dimensional,\nand highly ill-conditioned due to a singular likelihood, which becomes critical\nin particular in the case of missing data (unobserved pixels). This work\nstudies the evaluation of the expected error of AMVs using gradient-based\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. Our main contribution is to propose\na tempering strategy, which amounts to sampling a local approximation of the\njoint posterior distribution of AMVs and image variables in the neighborhood of\na point estimate. In addition, we provide efficient preconditioning with the\ncovariance related to the prior family itself (fractional Brownian motion),\nwith possibly different hyper-parameters. From a theoretical point of view, we\nshow that under regularity assumptions, the family of tempered posterior\ndistributions converges in distribution as temperature decreases to an\n{optimal} Gaussian approximation at a point estimate given by the Maximum A\nPosteriori (MAP) log-density. From an empirical perspective, we evaluate the\nproposed approach based on some quantitative Bayesian evaluation criteria. Our\nnumerical simulations performed on synthetic and real meteorological data\nreveal a significant gain in terms of accuracy of the AMV point estimates and\nof their associated expected error estimates, but also a substantial\nacceleration in the convergence speed of the MCMC algorithms.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the convergence of mean field games with finite state\nspace to mean field games with a continuous state space. We examine a space\ndiscretization of a diffusive dynamics, which is reminiscent of the Markov\nchain approximation method in stochasctic control, but also of finite\ndifference numerical schemes. We are mainly interested in the convergence of\nthe solution of the associated master equations as the number of states tends\nto infinity. We present two approaches, to treat the case without or with\ncommon noise, both under monotonicity assumptions. The first one uses the\nsystem of characteristics of the master equation, which is the MFG system, to\nestablish a convergence rate for the master equations without common noise and\nthe associated optimal trajectories, both in case there is a smooth solution to\nthe limit master equation and in case there is not. The second approach relies\non the notion of monotone solutions introduced by Bertucci. In the presence of\ncommon noise, we show convergence of the master equations, with a convergence\nrate if the limit master equation is smooth, otherwise by compactness\narguments.",

    "abstract": "We propose a method for estimating the bone mineral density (BMD) from a\nplain x-ray image. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and quantitative\ncomputed tomography (QCT) provide high accuracy in diagnosing osteoporosis;\nhowever, these modalities require special equipment and scan protocols.\nMeasuring BMD from an x-ray image provides an opportunistic screening, which is\npotentially useful for early diagnosis. The previous methods that directly\nlearn the relationship between x-ray images and BMD require a large training\ndataset to achieve high accuracy because of large intensity variations in the\nx-ray images. Therefore, we propose an approach using the QCT for training a\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN) and decomposing an x-ray image into a\nprojection of bone-segmented QCT. The proposed hierarchical learning improved\nthe robustness and accuracy of quantitatively decomposing a small-area target.\nThe evaluation of 200 patients with osteoarthritis using the proposed method,\nwhich we named BMD-GAN, demonstrated a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.888\nbetween the predicted and ground truth DXA-measured BMD. Besides not requiring\na large-scale training database, another advantage of our method is its\nextensibility to other anatomical areas, such as the vertebrae and rib bones.",

Ladder strategies place uniform volume across an\ninterval of contiguous prices. Scaled beta distribution based policies\ngeneralise these, allowing volume to be skewed across the price interval.

It will revolutionize the way we communicate and do other tasks, and\nit will allow for tasks that are not possible using the current, classical\ninternet. The backbone of a quantum internet is entanglement distributed\nglobally in order to allow for such novel applications to be performed over\nlong distances. Experimental progress is currently being made to realize\nquantum networks on a small scale, but much theoretical work is still needed in\norder to understand how best to distribute entanglement, especially with the\nlimitations of near-term quantum technologies taken into account. This work\nprovides an initial step towards this goal. In this work, we lay out a theory\nof near-term quantum networks based on Markov decision processes (MDPs), and we\nshow that MDPs provide a precise and systematic mathematical framework to model\nprotocols for near-term quantum networks that is agnostic to the specific\nimplementation platform. We start by simplifying the MDP for elementary links\nintroduced in prior work, and by providing new results on policies for\nelementary links in the steady-state (infinite-time) limit. In particular, we\nshow that the well-known memory-cutoff policy is optimal in the steady-state\nlimit. Then we show how the elementary link MDP can be used to analyze a\nquantum network protocol in which we wait for all elementary links to be active\nbefore creating end-to-end links. We then provide an extension of the MDP\nformalism to two elementary links, which is useful for analyzing more\nsophisticated quantum network protocols.

Metrics that quantify the\ndisparity in probability distributions, such as the Stein discrepancy, play an\nimportant role in statistical testing in high dimensions. In this paper, we\nconsider the setting where one wishes to distinguish between data sampled from\nan unknown probability distribution and a nominal model distribution. While\nrecent studies revealed that the optimal $L^2$-regularized Stein critic equals\nthe difference of the score functions of two probability distributions up to a\nmultiplicative constant, we investigate the role of $L^2$ regularization when\ntraining a neural network Stein discrepancy critic function. Motivated by the\nNeural Tangent Kernel theory of training neural networks, we develop a novel\nstaging procedure for the weight of regularization over training time. This\nleverages the advantages of highly-regularized training at early times while\nalso empirically delaying overfitting. Theoretically, we relate the training\ndynamic with large regularization weight to the kernel regression optimization\nof \"lazy training\" regime in early training times.
