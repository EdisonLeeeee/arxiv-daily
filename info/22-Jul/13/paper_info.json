    "abstract": "Neural networks have achieved impressive performance for data in the\ndistribution which is the same as the training set but can produce an\noverconfident incorrect result for the data these networks have never seen.\nTherefore, it is essential to detect whether inputs come from\nout-of-distribution(OOD) in order to guarantee the safety of neural networks\ndeployed in the real world. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective\npost-hoc technique, WeShort, to reduce the overconfidence of neural networks on\nOOD data. Our method is inspired by the observation of the internal residual\nstructure, which shows the separation of the OOD and in-distribution (ID) data\nin the shortcut layer. Our method is compatible with different OOD detection\nscores and can generalize well to different architectures of networks. We\ndemonstrate our method on various OOD datasets to show its competitive\nperformances and provide reasonable hypotheses to explain why our method works.\nOn the ImageNet benchmark, Weshort achieves state-of-the-art performance on the\nfalse positive rate (FPR95) and the area under the receiver operating\ncharacteristic (AUROC) on the family of post-hoc methods.",

    "abstract": "Traffic flow forecasting on graphs has real-world applications in many\nfields, such as transportation system and computer networks. Traffic\nforecasting can be highly challenging due to complex spatial-temporal\ncorrelations and non-linear traffic patterns. Existing works mostly model such\nspatial-temporal dependencies by considering spatial correlations and temporal\ncorrelations separately and fail to model the direct spatial-temporal\ncorrelations. Inspired by the recent success of transformers in the graph\ndomain, in this paper, we propose to directly model the cross-spatial-temporal\ncorrelations on the spatial-temporal graph using local multi-head\nself-attentions. To reduce the time complexity, we set the attention receptive\nfield to the spatially neighboring nodes, and we also introduce an adaptive\ngraph to capture the hidden spatial-temporal dependencies. Based on these\nattention mechanisms, we propose a novel Adaptive Graph Spatial-Temporal\nTransformer Network (ASTTN), which stacks multiple spatial-temporal attention\nlayers to apply self-attention on the input graph, followed by linear layers\nfor predictions.

    "abstract": "Causal background knowledge about the existence or the absence of causal\nedges and paths is frequently encountered in observational studies. The shared\ndirected edges and links of a subclass of Markov equivalent DAGs refined due to\nbackground knowledge can be represented by a causal maximally partially\ndirected acyclic graph (MPDAG). In this paper, we first provide a sound and\ncomplete graphical characterization of causal MPDAGs and give a minimal\nrepresentation of a causal MPDAG. Then, we introduce a novel representation\ncalled direct causal clause (DCC) to represent all types of causal background\nknowledge in a unified form. Using DCCs, we study the consistency and\nequivalency of causal background knowledge and show that any causal background\nknowledge set can be equivalently decomposed into a causal MPDAG plus a minimal\nresidual set of DCCs. Polynomial-time algorithms are also provided for checking\nthe consistency, equivalency, and finding the decomposed MPDAG and residual\nDCCs. Finally, with causal background knowledge, we prove a sufficient and\nnecessary condition to identify causal effects and surprisingly find that the\nidentifiability of causal effects only depends on the decomposed MPDAG. We also\ndevelop a local IDA-type algorithm to estimate the possible values of an\nunidentifiable effect.

    "abstract": "Semantic relation prediction aims to mine the implicit relationships between\nobjects in heterogeneous graphs, which consist of different types of objects\nand different types of links. In real-world scenarios, new semantic relations\nconstantly emerge and they typically appear with only a few labeled data. Since\na variety of semantic relations exist in multiple heterogeneous graphs, the\ntransferable knowledge can be mined from some existing semantic relations to\nhelp predict the new semantic relations with few labeled data. This inspires a\nnovel problem of few-shot semantic relation prediction across heterogeneous\ngraphs. However, the existing methods cannot solve this problem because they\nnot only require a large number of labeled samples as input, but also focus on\na single graph with a fixed heterogeneity. Targeting this novel and challenging\nproblem, in this paper, we propose a Meta-learning based Graph neural network\nfor Semantic relation prediction, named MetaGS. Firstly, MetaGS decomposes the\ngraph structure between objects into multiple normalized subgraphs, then adopts\na two-view graph neural network to capture local heterogeneous information and\nglobal structure information of these subgraphs. Secondly, MetaGS aggregates\nthe information of these subgraphs with a hyper-prototypical network, which can\nlearn from existing semantic relations and adapt to new semantic relations.\nThirdly, using the well-initialized two-view graph neural network and\nhyper-prototypical network, MetaGS can effectively learn new semantic relations\nfrom different graphs while overcoming the limitation of few labeled data.\nExtensive experiments on three real-world datasets have demonstrated the\nsuperior performance of MetaGS over the state-of-the-art methods.",

Nevertheless, prior works strictly assume that each source domain\nshares the identical group of classes with the target domain, which could\nhardly be guaranteed as the target label space is not observable. In this\npaper, we consider a more versatile setting of MSDA, namely Generalized\nMulti-source Domain Adaptation, wherein the source domains are partially\noverlapped, and the target domain is allowed to contain novel categories that\nare not presented in any source domains. This new setting is more elusive than\nany existing domain adaptation protocols due to the coexistence of the domain\nand category shifts across the source and target domains. To address this\nissue, we propose a variational domain disentanglement (VDD) framework, which\ndecomposes the domain representations and semantic features for each instance\nby encouraging dimension-wise independence. To identify the target samples of\nunknown classes, we leverage online pseudo labeling, which assigns the\npseudo-labels to unlabeled target data based on the confidence scores.\nQuantitative and qualitative experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate the validity of the proposed framework.",

However, in many cases, qualities such as\nreliability or even safety need to be ensured. To this end, one important\naspect is to determine whether or not ML components are deployed in situations\nthat are appropriate for their application scope. For components whose\nenvironments are open and variable, for instance those found in autonomous\nvehicles, it is therefore important to monitor their operational situation to\ndetermine its distance from the ML components' trained scope. If that distance\nis deemed too great, the application may choose to consider the ML component\noutcome unreliable and switch to alternatives, e.g. using human operator input\ninstead. SafeML is a model-agnostic approach for performing such monitoring,\nusing distance measures based on statistical testing of the training and\noperational datasets. Limitations in setting SafeML up properly include the\nlack of a systematic approach for determining, for a given application, how\nmany operational samples are needed to yield reliable distance information as\nwell as to determine an appropriate distance threshold.

In this paper, we show a surprising fact that contrastive\npre-training has an interesting yet implicit connection with robustness, and\nsuch natural robustness in the pre trained representation enables us to design\na powerful robust algorithm against adversarial attacks, RUSH, that combines\nthe standard contrastive pre-training and randomized smoothing. It boosts both\nstandard accuracy and robust accuracy, and significantly reduces training costs\nas compared with adversarial training. We use extensive empirical studies to\nshow that the proposed RUSH outperforms robust classifiers from adversarial\ntraining, by a significant margin on common benchmarks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,\nand STL-10) under first-order attacks. In particular, under\n$\\ell_{\\infty}$-norm perturbations of size 8/255 PGD attack on CIFAR-10, our\nmodel using ResNet-18 as backbone reached 77.8% robust accuracy and 87.9%\nstandard accuracy. Our work has an improvement of over 15% in robust accuracy\nand a slight improvement in standard accuracy, compared to the\nstate-of-the-arts.",

    "abstract": "Accurate assessment of the domain expertise of developers is important for\nassigning the proper candidate to contribute to a project or to attend a job\nrole. Since the potential candidate can come from a large pool, the automated\nassessment of this domain expertise is a desirable goal. While previous methods\nhave had some success within a single software project, the assessment of a\ndeveloper's domain expertise from contributions across multiple projects is\nmore challenging. In this paper, we employ doc2vec to represent the domain\nexpertise of developers as embedding vectors. These vectors are derived from\ndifferent sources that contain evidence of developers' expertise, such as the\ndescription of repositories that they contributed, their issue resolving\nhistory, and API calls in their commits. We name it dev2vec and demonstrate its\neffectiveness in representing the technical specialization of developers. Our\nresults indicate that encoding the expertise of developers in an embedding\nvector outperforms state-of-the-art methods and improves the F1-score up to\n21%. Moreover, our findings suggest that ``issue resolving history'' of\ndevelopers is the most informative source of information to represent the\ndomain expertise of developers in embedding spaces.",

This study reports the 2nd shared task called\nUrduFake@FIRE2021 on identifying fake news detection in Urdu. The goal of the\nshared task is to motivate the community to come up with efficient methods for\nsolving this vital problem, particularly for the Urdu language. The task is\nposed as a binary classification problem to label a given news article as a\nreal or a fake news article. The organizers provide a dataset comprising news\nin five domains: (i) Health, (ii) Sports, (iii) Showbiz, (iv) Technology, and\n(v) Business, split into training and testing sets. The training set contains\n1300 annotated news articles -- 750 real news, 550 fake news, while the testing\nset contains 300 news articles -- 200 real, 100 fake news. 34 teams from 7\ndifferent countries (China, Egypt, Israel, India, Mexico, Pakistan, and UAE)\nregistered to participate in the UrduFake@FIRE2021 shared task. Out of those,\n18 teams submitted their experimental results, and 11 of those submitted their\ntechnical reports, which is substantially higher compared to the UrduFake\nshared task in 2020 when only 6 teams submitted their technical reports. The\ntechnical reports submitted by the participants demonstrated different data\nrepresentation techniques ranging from count-based BoW features to word vector\nembeddings as well as the use of numerous machine learning algorithms ranging\nfrom traditional SVM to various neural network architectures including\nTransformers such as BERT and RoBERTa. In this year's competition, the best\nperforming system obtained an F1-macro score of 0.679, which is lower than the\npast year's best result of 0.907 F1-macro.

    "abstract": "In the last decade, most research in Machine Learning contributed to the\nimprovement of existing models, with the aim of increasing the performance of\nneural networks for the solution of a variety of different tasks. However, such\nadvancements often come at the cost of an increase of model memory and\ncomputational requirements. This represents a significant limitation for the\ndeployability of research output in realistic settings, where the cost, the\nenergy consumption, and the complexity of the framework play a crucial role. To\nsolve this issue, the designer should search for models that maximise the\nperformance while limiting its footprint. Typical approaches to reach this goal\nrely either on manual procedures, which cannot guarantee the optimality of the\nfinal design, or upon Neural Architecture Search algorithms to automatise the\nprocess, at the expenses of extremely high computational time. This paper\nprovides a solution for the fast identification of a neural network that\nmaximises the model accuracy while preserving size and computational\nconstraints typical of tiny devices. Our approach, named FreeREA, is a custom\ncell-based evolution NAS algorithm that exploits an optimised combination of\ntraining-free metrics to rank architectures during the search, thus without\nneed of model training. Our experiments, carried out on the common benchmarks\nNAS-Bench-101 and NATS-Bench, demonstrate that i) FreeREA is the first method\nable to provide very accurate models in minutes of search time; ii) it\noutperforms State of the Art training-based and training-free techniques in all\nthe datasets and benchmarks considered, and iii) it can easily generalise to\nconstrained scenarios, representing a competitive solution for fast Neural\nArchitecture Search in generic constrained applications.",

We show that the naive extensions of\nmulti-class attacks to the multi-label setting lead to violating label\nrelationships, modeled by a knowledge graph, and can be detected using a\nconsistency verification scheme. Therefore, we propose a graph-consistent\nmulti-label attack framework, which searches for small image perturbations that\nlead to misclassifying a desired target set while respecting label hierarchies.\nBy extensive experiments on two datasets and using several multi-label\nrecognition models, we show that our method generates extremely successful\nattacks that, unlike naive multi-label perturbations, can produce model\npredictions consistent with the knowledge graph.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number one cause of death worldwide.\nWhile there is growing evidence that the atrial fibrillation (AF) has strong\nassociations with various CVDs, this heart arrhythmia is usually diagnosed\nusing electrocardiography (ECG) which is a risk-free, non-intrusive, and\ncost-efficient tool. Continuously and remotely monitoring the subjects' ECG\ninformation unlocks the potentials of prompt pre-diagnosis and timely\npre-treatment of AF before the development of any life-threatening\nconditions/diseases. Ultimately, the CVDs associated mortality could be\nreduced. In this manuscript, the design and implementation of a personalized\nhealthcare system embodying a wearable ECG device, a mobile application, and a\nback-end server are presented. This system continuously monitors the users' ECG\ninformation to provide personalized health warnings/feedbacks. The users are\nable to communicate with their paired health advisors through this system for\nremote diagnoses, interventions, etc. The implemented wearable ECG devices have\nbeen evaluated and showed excellent intra-consistency (CVRMS=5.5%), acceptable\ninter-consistency (CVRMS=12.1%), and negligible RR-interval errors (ARE<1.4%).\nTo boost the battery life of the wearable devices, a lossy compression schema\nutilizing the quasi-periodic feature of ECG signals to achieve compression was\nproposed. Compared to the recognized schemata, it outperformed the others in\nterms of compression efficiency and distortion, and achieved at least 2x of CR\nat a certain PRD or RMSE for ECG signals from the MIT-BIH database. To enable\nautomated AF diagnosis/screening in the proposed system, a ResNet-based AF\ndetector was developed. For the ECG records from the 2017 PhysioNet CinC\nchallenge, this AF detector obtained an average testing F1=85.10% and a best\ntesting F1=87.31%, outperforming the state-of-the-art.",

However, due to the absence of a unifying evaluation\nprotocol for low-cost PM sensors, the evaluation results/performance\nspecifications from existing studies/datasheets are of limited reference values\nwhen attempting to determine the best candidate for the proposed system. In\nthis regard, the authors appeal to the research community to develop a\nstandardized evaluation protocol for low-cost PM sensors/devices, and a\nunifying attempt is established in this manuscript by adopting the definitive\nterminology from international documents and the evaluation metrics regarded as\nbest practices. Collocated on the rooftop of the HKUST Supersite, four\nempirically selected PM sensors were compared against each other and calibrated\nagainst two reference monitors. They were then evaluated against the reference\nfollowing the protocol. The PlanTower PMS-A003 sensor was selected for the\nwearable device as it outperformed the others in terms of affordability,\nportability, detection capability, data quality, as well as humidity and\ncondensation insusceptibility. An automated approach was proposed to identify\nand remove the condensation associated abnormal measurements. The proposed\ndevice has better affordability and portability as well as similar usability\nand data accessibility compared to those existing devices recognized. The first\n10 devices were also evaluated and calibrated at the Supersite. Additional 120\nunits were manufactured and delivered to the subjects to acquire their daily\nPM2.5 exposures for investigating the association with subclinical\natherosclerosis.",

Our approach\nmaintains a set of state estimators according to fault patterns and\nincorporates CBF-based linear constraints for each state estimator.

    "abstract": "A research division plays an important role of driving innovation in an\norganization. Drawing insights, following trends, keeping abreast of new\nresearch, and formulating strategies are increasingly becoming more challenging\nfor both researchers and executives as the amount of information grows in both\nvelocity and volume. In this paper we present a use case of how a corporate\nresearch community, IBM Research, utilizes Semantic Web technologies to induce\na unified Knowledge Graph from both structured and textual data obtained by\nintegrating various applications used by the community related to research\nprojects, academic papers, datasets, achievements and recognition. In order to\nmake the Knowledge Graph more accessible to application developers, we\nidentified a set of common patterns for exploiting the induced knowledge and\nexposed them as APIs. Those patterns were born out of user research which\nidentified the most valuable use cases or user pain points to be alleviated. We\noutline two distinct scenarios: recommendation and analytics for business use.\nWe will discuss these scenarios in detail and provide an empirical evaluation\non entity recommendation specifically. The methodology used and the lessons\nlearned from this work can be applied to other organizations facing similar\nchallenges.",

    "abstract": "In multi-modal multi-agent trajectory forecasting, two major challenges have\nnot been fully tackled: 1) how to measure the uncertainty brought by the\ninteraction module that causes correlations among the predicted trajectories of\nmultiple agents; 2) how to rank the multiple predictions and select the optimal\npredicted trajectory. In order to handle these challenges, this work first\nproposes a novel concept, collaborative uncertainty (CU), which models the\nuncertainty resulting from interaction modules. Then we build a general\nCU-aware regression framework with an original permutation-equivariant\nuncertainty estimator to do both tasks of regression and uncertainty\nestimation. Further, we apply the proposed framework to current SOTA\nmulti-agent multi-modal forecasting systems as a plugin module, which enables\nthe SOTA systems to 1) estimate the uncertainty in the multi-agent multi-modal\ntrajectory forecasting task; 2) rank the multiple predictions and select the\noptimal one based on the estimated uncertainty. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on a synthetic dataset and two public large-scale multi-agent\ntrajectory forecasting benchmarks. Experiments show that: 1) on the synthetic\ndataset, the CU-aware regression framework allows the model to appropriately\napproximate the ground-truth Laplace distribution; 2) on the multi-agent\ntrajectory forecasting benchmarks, the CU-aware regression framework steadily\nhelps SOTA systems improve their performances. Specially, the proposed\nframework helps VectorNet improve by 262 cm regarding the Final Displacement\nError of the chosen optimal prediction on the nuScenes dataset; 3) for\nmulti-agent multi-modal trajectory forecasting systems, prediction uncertainty\nis positively correlated with future stochasticity; and 4) the estimated CU\nvalues are highly related to the interactive information among agents.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning surrogate models have shown promise in solving partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs). Among them, the Fourier neural operator (FNO)\nachieves good accuracy, and is significantly faster compared to numerical\nsolvers, on a variety of PDEs, such as fluid flows. However, the FNO uses the\nFast Fourier transform (FFT), which is limited to rectangular domains with\nuniform grids. In this work, we propose a new framework, viz., geo-FNO, to\nsolve PDEs on arbitrary geometries. Geo-FNO learns to deform the input\n(physical) domain, which may be irregular, into a latent space with a uniform\ngrid. The FNO model with the FFT is applied in the latent space. The resulting\ngeo-FNO model has both the computation efficiency of FFT and the flexibility of\nhandling arbitrary geometries. Our geo-FNO is also flexible in terms of its\ninput formats, viz., point clouds, meshes, and design parameters are all valid\ninputs. We consider a variety of PDEs such as the Elasticity, Plasticity,\nEuler's, and Navier-Stokes equations, and both forward modeling and inverse\ndesign problems. Geo-FNO is $10^5$ times faster than the standard numerical\nsolvers and twice more accurate compared to direct interpolation on existing\nML-based PDE solvers such as the standard FNO.",

Problematically,\nin partially-observable or stochastic settings, optimal policies may depend on\nthe ground-truth distribution over aleatoric parameters of the environment in\nthe intended deployment setting, while curriculum learning necessarily shifts\nthe training distribution. We formalize this phenomenon as curriculum-induced\ncovariate shift (CICS), and describe how its occurrence in aleatoric parameters\ncan lead to suboptimal policies. Directly sampling these parameters from the\nground-truth distribution avoids the issue, but thwarts curriculum learning. We\npropose SAMPLR, a minimax regret UED method that optimizes the ground-truth\nutility function, even when the underlying training data is biased due to CICS.\nWe prove, and validate on challenging domains, that our approach preserves\noptimality under the ground-truth distribution, while promoting robustness\nacross the full range of environment settings.",

We\nfirst show that larger models are well-calibrated on diverse multiple choice\nand true/false questions when they are provided in the right format. Thus we\ncan approach self-evaluation on open-ended sampling tasks by asking models to\nfirst propose answers, and then to evaluate the probability \"P(True)\" that\ntheir answers are correct. We find encouraging performance, calibration, and\nscaling for P(True) on a diverse array of tasks. Performance at self-evaluation\nfurther improves when we allow models to consider many of their own samples\nbefore predicting the validity of one specific possibility. Next, we\ninvestigate whether models can be trained to predict \"P(IK)\", the probability\nthat \"I know\" the answer to a question, without reference to any particular\nproposed answer. Models perform well at predicting P(IK) and partially\ngeneralize across tasks, though they struggle with calibration of P(IK) on new\ntasks.

    "abstract": "This work studies the ability of a third-party influencer to control the\nbehavior of a multi-agent system. The controller exerts actions with the goal\nof guiding agents to attain target joint strategies. Under mild assumptions,\nthis can be modeled as a Markov decision problem and solved to find a control\npolicy. This setup is refined by introducing more degrees of freedom to the\ncontrol; the agents are partitioned into disjoint clusters such that each\ncluster can receive a unique control. Solving for a cluster-based policy\nthrough standard techniques like value iteration or policy iteration, however,\ntakes exponentially more computation time due to the expanded action space. A\nsolution is presented in the Clustered Value Iteration algorithm, which\niteratively solves for an optimal control via a round robin approach across the\nclusters. CVI converges exponentially faster than standard value iteration, and\ncan find policies that closely approximate the MDP's true optimal value. For\nMDPs with separable reward functions, CVI will converge to the true optimum.\nWhile an optimal clustering assignment is difficult to compute, a good\nclustering assignment for the agents may be found with a greedy splitting\nalgorithm, whose associated values form a monotonic, submodular lower bound to\nthe values of optimal clusters.

    "abstract": "The recent advances in continual (incremental or lifelong) learning have\nconcentrated on the prevention of forgetting that can lead to catastrophic\nconsequences, but there are two outstanding challenges that must be addressed.\nThe first is the evaluation of the robustness of the proposed methods. The\nsecond is ensuring the security of learned tasks remains largely unexplored.\nThis paper presents a comprehensive study of the susceptibility of the\ncontinually learned tasks (including both current and previously learned tasks)\nthat are vulnerable to forgetting. Such vulnerability of tasks against\nadversarial attacks raises profound issues in data integrity and privacy. We\nconsider the task incremental learning (Task-IL) scenario and explore three\nregularization-based experiments, three replay-based experiments, and one\nhybrid technique based on the reply and exemplar approach. We examine the\nrobustness of these methods. In particular, we consider cases where we\ndemonstrate that any class belonging to the current or previously learned tasks\nis prone to misclassification. Our observations highlight the potential\nlimitations of existing Task-IL approaches. Our empirical study recommends that\nthe research community consider the robustness of the proposed continual\nlearning approaches and invest extensive efforts in mitigating catastrophic\nforgetting.",

    "abstract": "Safe and reliable autonomy solutions are a critical component of\nnext-generation intelligent transportation systems. Autonomous vehicles in such\nsystems must reason about complex and dynamic driving scenes in real time and\nanticipate the behavior of nearby drivers. Human driving behavior is highly\nnuanced and specific to individual traffic participants. For example, drivers\nmight display cooperative or non-cooperative behaviors in the presence of\nmerging vehicles. These behaviors must be estimated and incorporated in the\nplanning process for safe and efficient driving. In this work, we present a\nframework for estimating the cooperation level of drivers on a freeway and plan\nmerging maneuvers with the drivers' latent behaviors explicitly modeled. The\nlatent parameter estimation problem is solved using a particle filter to\napproximate the probability distribution over the cooperation level.

    "abstract": "K-nearest neighbor search is one of the fundamental tasks in various\napplications and the hierarchical navigable small world (HNSW) has recently\ndrawn attention in large-scale cloud services, as it easily scales up the\ndatabase while offering fast search. On the other hand, a computational storage\ndevice (CSD) that combines programmable logic and storage modules on a single\nboard becomes popular to address the data bandwidth bottleneck of modern\ncomputing systems. In this paper, we propose a computational storage platform\nthat can accelerate a large-scale graph-based nearest neighbor search algorithm\nbased on SmartSSD CSD. To this end, we modify the algorithm more amenable on\nthe hardware and implement two types of accelerators using HLS- and RTL-based\nmethodology with various optimization methods. In addition, we scale up the\nproposed platform to have 4 SmartSSDs and apply graph parallelism to boost the\nsystem performance further. As a result, the proposed computational storage\nplatform achieves 75.59 query per second throughput for the SIFT1B dataset at\n258.66W power dissipation, which is 12.83x and 17.91x faster and 10.43x and\n24.33x more energy efficient than the conventional CPU-based and GPU-based\nserver platform, respectively.

    "abstract": "Survival analysis, time-to-event analysis, is an important problem in\nhealthcare since it has a wide-ranging impact on patients and palliative care.\nMany survival analysis methods have assumed that the survival data is centrally\navailable either from one medical center or by data sharing from multi-centers.\nHowever, the sensitivity of the patient attributes and the strict privacy laws\nhave increasingly forbidden sharing of healthcare data. To address this\nchallenge, the research community has looked at the solution of decentralized\ntraining and sharing of model parameters using the Federated Learning (FL)\nparadigm. In this paper, we study the utilization of FL for performing survival\nanalysis on distributed healthcare datasets. Recently, the popular Cox\nproportional hazard (CPH) models have been adapted for FL settings; however,\ndue to its linearity and proportional hazards assumptions, CPH models result in\nsuboptimal performance, especially for non-linear, non-iid, and heavily\ncensored survival datasets. To overcome the challenges of existing federated\nsurvival analysis methods, we leverage the predictive accuracy of the deep\nlearning models and the power of pseudo values to propose a first-of-its-kind,\npseudo value-based deep learning model for federated survival analysis (FSA)\ncalled FedPseudo. Furthermore, we introduce a novel approach of deriving pseudo\nvalues for survival probability in the FL settings that speeds up the\ncomputation of pseudo values. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world\ndatasets show that our pseudo valued-based FL framework achieves similar\nperformance as the best centrally trained deep survival analysis model.\nMoreover, our proposed FL approach obtains the best results for various\ncensoring settings.",

Such heuristic\nfeature design renders the effectiveness of features susceptible to incomplete\nperson localization and disregards the importance of scene contexts.\nFurthermore, region features are sub-optimal to identify group members because\nthe features may be dominated by those of people in the regions and have\ndifferent semantics.

    "abstract": "Convex (specifically semidefinite) relaxation provides a powerful approach to\nconstructing robust machine perception systems, enabling the recovery of\ncertifiably globally optimal solutions of challenging estimation problems in\nmany practical settings. However, solving the large-scale semidefinite\nrelaxations underpinning this approach remains a formidable computational\nchallenge. A dominant cost in many state-of-the-art (Burer-Monteiro\nfactorization-based) certifiable estimation methods is solution verification\n(testing the global optimality of a given candidate solution), which entails\ncomputing a minimum eigenpair of a certain symmetric certificate matrix. In\nthis paper, we show how to significantly accelerate this verification step, and\nthereby the overall speed of certifiable estimation methods. First, we show\nthat the certificate matrices arising in the Burer-Monteiro approach\ngenerically possess spectra that make the verification problem expensive to\nsolve using standard iterative eigenvalue methods. We then show how to address\nthis challenge using preconditioned eigensolvers; specifically, we design a\nspecialized solution verification algorithm based upon the locally optimal\nblock preconditioned conjugate gradient (LOBPCG) method together with a simple\nyet highly effective algebraic preconditioner. Experimental evaluation on a\nvariety of simulated and real-world examples shows that our proposed\nverification scheme is very effective in practice, accelerating solution\nverification by up to 280x, and the overall Burer-Monteiro method by up to 16x,\nversus the standard Lanczos method when applied to relaxations derived from\nlarge-scale SLAM benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "We propose an unfitted finite element method for numerically solving the\ntime-harmonic Maxwell equations on a smooth domain. The model problem involves\na Lagrangian multiplier to relax the divergence constraint of the vector\nunknown. The embedded boundary of the domain is allowed to cut through the\nbackground mesh arbitrarily. The unfitted scheme is based on a mixed interior\npenalty formulation, where Nitsche penalty method is applied to enforce the\nboundary condition in a weak sense, and a penalty stabilization technique is\nadopted based on a local direct extension operator to ensure the stability for\ncut elements. We prove the inf-sup stability and obtain optimal convergence\nrates under the energy norm and the $L^2$ norm for both the vector unknown and\nthe Lagrangian multiplier. Numerical examples in both two and three dimensions\nare presented to illustrate the accuracy of the method.",

However, previous\nMRR-based CNN accelerators fail to provide efficient adaptability for CNNs with\nmixed-sized tensors. One example of such CNNs is depthwise separable CNNs.\nPerforming inferences of CNNs with mixed-sized tensors on such inflexible\naccelerators often leads to low hardware utilization, which diminishes the\nachievable performance and energy efficiency from the accelerators. In this\npaper, we present a novel way of introducing reconfigurability in the MRR-based\nCNN accelerators, to enable dynamic maximization of the size compatibility\nbetween the accelerator hardware components and the CNN tensors that are\nprocessed using the hardware components. We classify the state-of-the-art\nMRR-based CNN accelerators from prior works into two categories, based on the\nlayout and relative placements of the utilized hardware components in the\naccelerators. We then use our method to introduce reconfigurability in\naccelerators from these two classes, to consequently improve their parallelism,\nthe flexibility of efficiently mapping tensors of different sizes, speed, and\noverall energy efficiency. We evaluate our reconfigurable accelerators against\nthree prior works for the area proportionate outlook (equal hardware area for\nall accelerators). Our evaluation for the inference of four modern CNNs\nindicates that our designed reconfigurable CNN accelerators provide\nimprovements of up to 1.8x in Frames-Per-Second (FPS) and up to 1.5x in FPS/W,\ncompared to an MRR-based accelerator from prior work.",

    "abstract": "Over two thirds of women of all ages in the UK have experienced some form of\nsexual harassment in a public space. Recent tragic incidents involving female\npedestrians have highlighted some of the personal safety issues that women\nstill face in cities today. There exist many popular location-based safety\napplications as a result of this; however, these applications tend to take a\nreactive approach where action is taken only after an incident has occurred.\nThis paper proposes a preventative approach to the problem by creating safer\npublic environments through societal incentivisation. The proposed system,\ncalled \"Herd Routes\", improves the safety of female pedestrians by generating\nbusier pedestrian routes as a result of route incentivisation. A novel\napplication of distributed ledgers is proposed to provide security and trust, a\nrecord of system users' locations and IDs, and a platform for token exchange. A\nproof-of-concept was developed using the simulation package SUMO (Simulation of\nUrban Mobility), and a smartphone app. was built in Android Studio so that\npedestrian Hardware-in-the-Loop testing could be carried out to validate the\ntechnical feasibility and desirability of the system. With positive results\nfrom the initial testing of the proof-of-concept, further development could\nsignificantly contribute towards creating safer pedestrian routes through\ncities, and tackle the societal change that is required to improve female\npedestrian safety in the long term.",

However, when the labeled data is insufficient for specific domains\ndue to labor-intensive annotation work, the performance of existing algorithms\nwill suffer an intolerable decline. In this paper, we endeavor to solve the\nproblem of few-shot entity linking, which only requires a minimal amount of\nin-domain labeled data and is more practical in real situations. Specifically,\nwe firstly propose a novel weak supervision strategy to generate non-trivial\nsynthetic entity-mention pairs based on mention rewriting. Since the quality of\nthe synthetic data has a critical impact on effective model training, we\nfurther design a meta-learning mechanism to assign different weights to each\nsynthetic entity-mention pair automatically. Through this way, we can\nprofoundly exploit rich and precious semantic information to derive a\nwell-trained entity linking model under the few-shot setting. The experiments\non real-world datasets show that the proposed method can extensively improve\nthe state-of-the-art few-shot entity linking model and achieve impressive\nperformance when only a small amount of labeled data is available.

This is particularly the\ncase when dealing with highly consequential applications (e.g. medical imaging,\nself-driving cars, etc). The goal is to design a detector that can accept\nmeaningful variations of the ID data, while also rejecting examples from OOD\nregimes. In practice, this dual objective can be realized by enforcing\nconsistency using an appropriate scoring function (e.g., energy) and\ncalibrating the detector to reject a curated set of OOD data (referred to as\noutlier exposure or shortly OE). While OE methods are widely adopted,\nassembling representative OOD datasets is both costly and challenging due to\nthe unpredictability of real-world scenarios, hence the recent trend of\ndesigning OE-free detectors. In this paper, we make a surprising finding that\ncontrolled generalization to ID variations and exposure to diverse (synthetic)\noutlier examples are essential to simultaneously improving semantic and\nmodality shift detection. In contrast to existing methods, our approach samples\ninliers in the latent space, and constructs outlier examples via negative data\naugmentation.

In this paper, we aim to learn personalized age\nestimators without the above requirements and propose a meta-learning method\nnamed MetaAge for age estimation.

Moreover, most of the previous attempts lacked of the\nability of uncertainty estimation. Generally, the pathologists often jointly\nanalyze WSI from the different magnifications.

In medical applications, MSA can provide insights about\nthe complex disease progression in patients. A key challenge in MSA is the\naccurate subject-specific prediction of multi-state model quantities such as\ntransition probability and state occupation probability in the presence of\ncensoring. Traditional multi-state methods such as Aalen-Johansen (AJ)\nestimators and Cox-based methods are respectively limited by Markov and\nproportional hazards assumptions and are infeasible for making subject-specific\npredictions. Neural ordinary differential equations for MSA relax these\nassumptions but are computationally expensive and do not directly model the\ntransition probabilities. To address these limitations, we propose a new class\nof pseudo-value-based deep learning models for multi-state survival analysis,\nwhere we show that pseudo values - designed to handle censoring - can be a\nnatural replacement for estimating the multi-state model quantities when\nderived from a consistent estimator. In particular, we provide an algorithm to\nderive pseudo values from consistent estimators to directly predict the\nmulti-state survival quantities from the subject's covariates. Empirical\nresults on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our proposed models\nachieve state-of-the-art results under various censoring settings.",

    "title": "Towards Hard-Positive Query Mining for DETR-based Human-Object  Interaction Detection",
    "abstract": "Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is a core task for high-level image\nunderstanding. Recently, Detection Transformer (DETR)-based HOI detectors have\nbecome popular due to their superior performance and efficient structure.\nHowever, these approaches typically adopt fixed HOI queries for all testing\nimages, which is vulnerable to the location change of objects in one specific\nimage. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose to enhance DETR's robustness by\nmining hard-positive queries, which are forced to make correct predictions\nusing partial visual cues. First, we explicitly compose hard-positive queries\naccording to the ground-truth (GT) position of labeled human-object pairs for\neach training image. Specifically, we shift the GT bounding boxes of each\nlabeled human-object pair so that the shifted boxes cover only a certain\nportion of the GT ones. We encode the coordinates of the shifted boxes for each\nlabeled human-object pair into an HOI query. Second, we implicitly construct\nanother set of hard-positive queries by masking the top scores in\ncross-attention maps of the decoder layers. The masked attention maps then only\ncover partial important cues for HOI predictions. Finally, an alternate\nstrategy is proposed that efficiently combines both types of hard queries. In\neach iteration, both DETR's learnable queries and one selected type of\nhard-positive queries are adopted for loss computation. Experimental results\nshow that our proposed approach can be widely applied to existing DETR-based\nHOI detectors. Moreover, we consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance\non three benchmarks: HICO-DET, V-COCO, and HOI-A. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/MuchHair/HQM.",

Training is done using the raw data on\nthe users' device, called clients, and only the training results, called\ngradients, are sent to the server to be aggregated and generate an updated\nmodel. However, we cannot assume that the server can be trusted with private\ninformation, such as metadata related to the owner or source of the data.

    "abstract": "Despite the recent progress in speech emotion recognition (SER),\nstate-of-the-art systems lack generalisation across different conditions. A key\nunderlying reason for poor generalisation is the scarcity of emotion datasets,\nwhich is a significant roadblock to designing robust machine learning (ML)\nmodels. Recent works in SER focus on utilising multitask learning (MTL) methods\nto improve generalisation by learning shared representations. However, most of\nthese studies propose MTL solutions with the requirement of meta labels for\nauxiliary tasks, which limits the training of SER systems. This paper proposes\nan MTL framework (MTL-AUG) that learns generalised representations from\naugmented data. We utilise augmentation-type classification and unsupervised\nreconstruction as auxiliary tasks, which allow training SER systems on\naugmented data without requiring any meta labels for auxiliary tasks. The\nsemi-supervised nature of MTL-AUG allows for the exploitation of the abundant\nunlabelled data to further boost the performance of SER. We comprehensively\nevaluate the proposed framework in the following settings: (1) within corpus,\n(2) cross-corpus and cross-language, (3) noisy speech, (4) and adversarial\nattacks.

Directly applying existing works to facial\ndiscrete attributes may cause inaccurate results. In this work, we propose an\ninnovative framework to tackle challenging facial discrete attribute synthesis\nvia semantic decomposing, dubbed SD-GAN.

The offset latent presentation obtained by 3D-aware semantic\nfusion network is proposed to adjust prior basis. In addition, the fusion\nnetwork integrates 3D embedding for better identity preservation and discrete\nattribute synthesis. The combination of prior basis and offset latent\nrepresentation enable our method to synthesize photo-realistic face images with\ndiscrete attributes.

It is not immediately clear, however, how existing\ncausal conceptions of fairness relate to one another, or what the consequences\nare of using these definitions as design principles. Here, we first assemble\nand categorize popular causal definitions of algorithmic fairness into two\nbroad families: (1) those that constrain the effects of decisions on\ncounterfactual disparities; and (2) those that constrain the effects of legally\nprotected characteristics, like race and gender, on decisions. We then show,\nanalytically and empirically, that both families of definitions \\emph{almost\nalways} -- in a measure theoretic sense -- result in strongly Pareto dominated\ndecision policies, meaning there is an alternative, unconstrained policy\nfavored by every stakeholder with preferences drawn from a large, natural\nclass. For example, in the case of college admissions decisions, policies\nconstrained to satisfy causal fairness definitions would be disfavored by every\nstakeholder with neutral or positive preferences for both academic preparedness\nand diversity. Indeed, under a prominent definition of causal fairness, we\nprove the resulting policies require admitting all students with the same\nprobability, regardless of academic qualifications or group membership.

Here, humans and a DCNN\nperformed a challenging face-identity matching task that included identical\ntwins. Participants (N=87) viewed pairs of face images of three types:\nsame-identity, general imposter pairs (different identities from similar\ndemographic groups), and twin imposter pairs (identical twin siblings). The\ntask was to determine whether the pairs showed the same person or different\npeople. Identity comparisons were tested in three viewpoint-disparity\nconditions: frontal to frontal, frontal to 45-degree profile, and frontal to\n90-degree profile. Accuracy for discriminating matched-identity pairs from\ntwin-imposters and general imposters was assessed in each viewpoint-disparity\ncondition. Humans were more accurate for general-imposter pairs than\ntwin-imposter pairs, and accuracy declined with increased viewpoint disparity\nbetween the images in a pair. A DCNN trained for face identification (Ranjan et\nal., 2018) was tested on the same image pairs presented to humans. Machine\nperformance mirrored the pattern of human accuracy, but with performance at or\nabove all humans in all but one condition.

Secondly,\nwe reduce the computational cost by combining three performance estimation\nmethods, i.e., parameter sharing, low-fidelity evaluation, and surrogate-based\npredictor. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is confirmed by extensive\nexperiments conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN datasets.",

However, to explore the potential of ONNs, it is necessary to\ninvestigate the full-system performance incorporating the major DNN elements,\nincluding matrix algebra and nonlinear activation. Existing challenges to ONNs\nare high energy consumption due to low electro-optic (EO) conversion\nefficiency, low compute density due to large device footprint and channel\ncrosstalk, and long latency due to the lack of inline nonlinearity. Here we\nexperimentally demonstrate an ONN system that simultaneously overcomes all\nthese challenges.

    "abstract": "Recently, many semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) methods adopt\nteacher-student framework and have achieved state-of-the-art results. However,\nthe teacher network is tightly coupled with the student network since the\nteacher is an exponential moving average (EMA) of the student, which causes a\nperformance bottleneck. To address the coupling problem, we propose a Cycle\nSelf-Training (CST) framework for SSOD, which consists of two teachers T1 and\nT2, two students S1 and S2. Based on these networks, a cycle self-training\nmechanism is built, i.e.,\nS1${\\rightarrow}$T1${\\rightarrow}$S2${\\rightarrow}$T2${\\rightarrow}$S1. For\nS${\\rightarrow}$T, we also utilize the EMA weights of the students to update\nthe teachers. For T${\\rightarrow}$S, instead of providing supervision for its\nown student S1(S2) directly, the teacher T1(T2) generates pseudo-labels for the\nstudent S2(S1), which looses the coupling effect. Moreover, owing to the\nproperty of EMA, the teacher is most likely to accumulate the biases from the\nstudent and make the mistakes irreversible. To mitigate the problem, we also\npropose a distribution consistency reweighting strategy, where pseudo-labels\nare reweighted based on distribution consistency across the teachers T1 and T2.\nWith the strategy, the two students S2 and S1 can be trained robustly with\nnoisy pseudo labels to avoid confirmation biases. Extensive experiments prove\nthe superiority of CST by consistently improving the AP over the baseline and\noutperforming state-of-the-art methods by 2.1% absolute AP improvements with\nscarce labeled data.",

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning has shown promising potential in self-supervised\nspatio-temporal representation learning. Most works naively sample different\nclips to construct positive and negative pairs. However, we observe that this\nformulation inclines the model towards the background scene bias. The\nunderlying reasons are twofold. First, the scene difference is usually more\nnoticeable and easier to discriminate than the motion difference. Second, the\nclips sampled from the same video often share similar backgrounds but have\ndistinct motions. Simply regarding them as positive pairs will draw the model\nto the static background rather than the motion pattern. To tackle this\nchallenge, this paper presents a novel dual contrastive formulation.\nConcretely, we decouple the input RGB video sequence into two complementary\nmodes, static scene and dynamic motion. Then, the original RGB features are\npulled closer to the static features and the aligned dynamic features,\nrespectively. In this way, the static scene and the dynamic motion are\nsimultaneously encoded into the compact RGB representation. We further conduct\nthe feature space decoupling via activation maps to distill static- and\ndynamic-related features. We term our method as \\textbf{D}ual\n\\textbf{C}ontrastive \\textbf{L}earning for spatio-temporal\n\\textbf{R}epresentation (DCLR).

    "abstract": "Conventional knowledge distillation (KD) methods for object detection mainly\nconcentrate on homogeneous teacher-student detectors. However, the design of a\nlightweight detector for deployment is often significantly different from a\nhigh-capacity detector. Thus, we investigate KD among heterogeneous\nteacher-student pairs for a wide application. We observe that the core\ndifficulty for heterogeneous KD (hetero-KD) is the significant semantic gap\nbetween the backbone features of heterogeneous detectors due to the different\noptimization manners. Conventional homogeneous KD (homo-KD) methods suffer from\nsuch a gap and are hard to directly obtain satisfactory performance for\nhetero-KD. In this paper, we propose the HEtero-Assists Distillation (HEAD)\nframework, leveraging heterogeneous detection heads as assistants to guide the\noptimization of the student detector to reduce this gap. In HEAD, the assistant\nis an additional detection head with the architecture homogeneous to the\nteacher head attached to the student backbone. Thus, a hetero-KD is transformed\ninto a homo-KD, allowing efficient knowledge transfer from the teacher to the\nstudent. Moreover, we extend HEAD into a Teacher-Free HEAD (TF-HEAD) framework\nwhen a well-trained teacher detector is unavailable. Our method has achieved\nsignificant improvement compared to current detection KD methods. For example,\non the MS-COCO dataset, TF-HEAD helps R18 RetinaNet achieve 33.9 mAP (+2.2),\nwhile HEAD further pushes the limit to 36.2 mAP (+4.5).",

Moreover, there is no method currently built for an\nintrinsically interpretable transformer, which is able to explain its reasoning\nprocess and provide a faithful explanation. To close these crucial gaps, we\npropose a novel vision transformer dubbed the eXplainable Vision Transformer\n(eX-ViT), an intrinsically interpretable transformer model that is able to\njointly discover robust interpretable features and perform the prediction.\nSpecifically, eX-ViT is composed of the Explainable Multi-Head Attention\n(E-MHA) module, the Attribute-guided Explainer (AttE) module and the\nself-supervised attribute-guided loss. The E-MHA tailors explainable attention\nweights that are able to learn semantically interpretable representations from\nlocal patches in terms of model decisions with noise robustness. Meanwhile,\nAttE is proposed to encode discriminative attribute features for the target\nobject through diverse attribute discovery, which constitutes faithful evidence\nfor the model's predictions. In addition, a self-supervised attribute-guided\nloss is developed for our eX-ViT, which aims at learning enhanced\nrepresentations through the attribute discriminability mechanism and attribute\ndiversity mechanism, to localize diverse and discriminative attributes and\ngenerate more robust explanations.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a combined use of transformed images and vision\ntransformer (ViT) models transformed with a secret key. We show for the first\ntime that models trained with plain images can be directly transformed to\nmodels trained with encrypted images on the basis of the ViT architecture, and\nthe performance of the transformed models is the same as models trained with\nplain images when using test images encrypted with the key. In addition, the\nproposed scheme does not require any specially prepared data for training\nmodels or network modification, so it also allows us to easily update the\nsecret key. In an experiment, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is\nevaluated in terms of performance degradation and model protection performance\nin an image classification task on the CIFAR-10 dataset.",

    "abstract": "A new method for joint ranging and Phase Offset (PO) estimation of multiple\ndrones/aircrafts is proposed in this paper. The proposed method employs the\nsuperimposed uncoordinated Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B)\npackets broadcasted by drones/aircrafts for joint range and PO estimation. It\njointly estimates range and PO prior to ADS-B packet decoding; thus, it can\nimprove air safety when packet decoding is infeasible due to packet collision.\nMoreover, it enables coherent detection of ADS-B packets, which can result in\nmore reliable multiple target tracking in aviation systems using cooperative\nsensors for detect and avoid (DAA). By minimizing the Kullback Leibler\nDivergence (KLD) statistical distance measure, we show that the received\ncomplex baseband signal coming from K uncoordinated drones corrupted by\nAdditive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) at a single antenna receiver can be\napproximated by an independent and identically distributed Gaussian Mixture\n(GM) with 2 power K mixture components in the two dimensional (2D) plane. While\ndirect joint Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) of range and PO from the\nderived GM Probability Density Function (PDF) leads to an intractable\nmaximization, our proposed method employs the Expectation Maximization (EM)\nalgorithm to estimate the modes of the 2D Gaussian mixture followed by a\nreordering estimation technique through combinatorial optimization to estimate\nrange and PO. An extension to a multiple antenna receiver is also investigated\nin this paper. While the proposed estimator can estimate the range of multiple\ndrones with a single receive antenna, a larger number of drones can be\nsupported with higher accuracy by the use of multiple antennas at the receiver.\nThe effectiveness of the proposed estimator is supported by simulation results.\nWe show that the proposed estimator can jointly estimate the range of three\ndrones accurately.",

    "abstract": "Although significant progress has been achieved on monocular maker-less human\nmotion capture in recent years, it is still hard for state-of-the-art methods\nto obtain satisfactory results in occlusion scenarios. There are two main\nreasons: the one is that the occluded motion capture is inherently ambiguous as\nvarious 3D poses can map to the same 2D observations, which always results in\nan unreliable estimation. The other is that no sufficient occluded human data\ncan be used for training a robust model. To address the obstacles, our key-idea\nis to employ non-occluded human data to learn a joint-level spatial-temporal\nmotion prior for occluded human with a self-supervised strategy. To further\nreduce the gap between synthetic and real occlusion data, we build the first 3D\noccluded motion dataset~(OcMotion), which can be used for both training and\ntesting. We encode the motions in 2D maps and synthesize occlusions on\nnon-occluded data for the self-supervised training. A spatial-temporal layer is\nthen designed to learn joint-level correlations. The learned prior reduces the\nambiguities of occlusions and is robust to diverse occlusion types, which is\nthen adopted to assist the occluded human motion capture. Experimental results\nshow that our method can generate accurate and coherent human motions from\noccluded videos with good generalization ability and runtime efficiency.

However, the answer from the oracle is correct only with\nprobability $\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{\\delta}{2}$. The goal is to recover the hidden\nclusters with minimum number of noisy queries.

In this work, we give an information-theoretic\nanalysis on the generalization error and excess risk of transfer learning\nalgorithms, following a line of work initiated by Russo and Xu. Our results\nsuggest, perhaps as expected, that the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence\n$D(\\mu||\\mu')$ plays an important role in the characterizations where $\\mu$ and\n$\\mu'$ denote the distribution of the training data and the testing test,\nrespectively. Specifically, we provide generalization error upper bounds for\nthe empirical risk minimization (ERM) algorithm where data from both\ndistributions are available in the training phase. We further apply the\nanalysis to approximated ERM methods such as the Gibbs algorithm and the\nstochastic gradient descent method. We then generalize the mutual information\nbound with $\\phi$-divergence and Wasserstein distance. These generalizations\nlead to tighter bounds and can handle the case when $\\mu$ is not absolutely\ncontinuous with respect to $\\mu'$. Furthermore, we apply a new set of\ntechniques to obtain an alternative upper bound which gives a fast (and\noptimal) learning rate for some learning problems.

However, determining whether $SD$ has the restricted isometry\nproperty for a given sparisfying dictionary is an NP-hard problem, hampering\nthe application of compressive sensing.

    "abstract": "For black-box attacks, the gap between the substitute model and the victim\nmodel is usually large, which manifests as a weak attack performance. Motivated\nby the observation that the transferability of adversarial examples can be\nimproved by attacking diverse models simultaneously, model augmentation methods\nwhich simulate different models by using transformed images are proposed.\nHowever, existing transformations for spatial domain do not translate to\nsignificantly diverse augmented models. To tackle this issue, we propose a\nnovel spectrum simulation attack to craft more transferable adversarial\nexamples against both normally trained and defense models. Specifically, we\napply a spectrum transformation to the input and thus perform the model\naugmentation in the frequency domain. We theoretically prove that the\ntransformation derived from frequency domain leads to a diverse spectrum\nsaliency map, an indicator we proposed to reflect the diversity of substitute\nmodels.

Prior time-series forecasting research has\nmainly focused on mapping a past subseries (lookback window) to a future series\n(forecast window), and time of series often just play an auxiliary role even\ncompletely ignored in most cases. Due to the point-wise processing within these\nwindows, extrapolating series to longer-term future is tough in the pattern. To\novercome this barrier, we propose a brand-new time-series forecasting framework\nnamed Dateformer who turns attention to modeling time instead of following the\nabove practice. Specifically, time-series are first split into patches by day\nto supervise the learning of dynamic date-representations with Date Encoder\nRepresentations from Transformers (DERT). These representations are then fed\ninto a simple decoder to produce a coarser (or global) prediction, and used to\nhelp the model seek valuable information from the lookback window to learn a\nrefined (or local) prediction. Dateformer obtains the final result by summing\nthe above two parts. Our empirical studies on seven benchmarks show that the\ntime-modeling method is more efficient for long-term series forecasting\ncompared with sequence modeling methods. Dateformer yields state-of-the-art\naccuracy with a 40% remarkable relative improvement, and broadens the maximum\ncredible forecasting range to a half-yearly level.",

In this scope, this paper presents a novel real-time human-UAV\ninteraction detection approach, where Long short-term memory (LSTM) based\nneural network is developed to detect state profiles resulting from human\ninteraction dynamics. A novel data pre-processing technique is presented; this\ntechnique leverages estimated process parameters of training and testing UAVs\nto build dynamics invariant testing data. The proposed detection algorithm is\nlightweight and thus can be deployed in real-time using off the shelf UAV\nplatforms; in addition, it depends solely on inertial and position measurements\npresent on any classical UAV platform. The proposed approach is demonstrated on\na payload handover task between multirotor UAVs and humans. Training and\ntesting data were collected using real-time experiments. The detection approach\nhas achieved an accuracy of 96\\%, giving no false positives even in the\npresence of external wind disturbances, and when deployed and tested on two\ndifferent UAVs.",

Existing methods focus on\nexcavating the knowledge hints and transferring the whole knowledge to the\nstudent.

    "abstract": "Numerous threats are associated with the globalized integrated circuit (IC)\nsupply chain, such as piracy, reverse engineering, overproduction, and\nmalicious logic insertion. Many obfuscation approaches have been proposed to\nmitigate these threats by preventing an adversary from fully understanding the\nIC (or parts of it). The use of reconfigurable elements inside an IC is a known\nobfuscation technique, either as a coarse grain reconfigurable block (i.e.,\neFPGA) or as a fine grain element (i.e., FPGA-like look-up tables). This paper\npresents a security-aware CAD flow that is LUT-based yet still compatible with\nthe standard cell based physical synthesis flow. More precisely, our CAD flow\nexplores the FPGA-ASIC design space and produces heavily obfuscated designs\nwhere only small portions of the logic resemble an ASIC. Therefore, we term\nthis specialized solution an \"embedded ASIC\" (eASIC). Nevertheless, even for\nheavily LUT-dominated designs, our proposed decomposition and pin swapping\nalgorithms allow for performance gains that enable performance levels that only\nASICs would otherwise achieve. On the security side, we have developed novel\ntemplate-based attacks and also applied existing attacks, both oracle-free and\noracle-based. Our security analysis revealed that the obfuscation rate for an\nSHA-256 study case should be at least 45% for withstanding traditional attacks\nand at least 80% for withstanding template-based attacks. When the 80\\%\nobfuscated SHA-256 design is physically implemented, it achieves a remarkable\nfrequency of 368MHz in a 65nm commercial technology, whereas its FPGA\nimplementation (in a superior technology) achieves only 77MHz.",

In the recent years there has been a great amount\nof work on this topic. One of the main problems in this topic is to determine\nthe largest length of a q-ary Singleton-optimal locally repairable code for\ngiven locality and minimum distance. Unlike classical MDS codes, the maximum\nlength of Singleton? Optimal locally repairable codes are very sensitive to\nminimum distance and locality. Thus, it is more challenging and complicated to\ninvestigate the maximum length of Singleton-optimal locally repairable codes.\nIn literature, there has been already some research on this problem. However,\nmost of work is concerned with some specific parameter regime such as small\nminimum distance and locality, and rely on the constraint that (r + 1)|n and\nrecovery sets are disjoint, where r is locality and n is the code length. In\nthis paper we study the problem for large range of parameters including the\ncase where minimum distance is proportional to length. In addition, we also\nderive some upper bounds on the maximum length of Singleton-optimal locally\nrepairable codes with small minimum distance by removing this constraint. It\nturns out that even without the constraint we still get better upper bounds for\ncodes with small locality and distance compared with known results.\nFurthermore, based on our upper bounds for codes with small distance and\nlocality and some propagation rule that we propose in this paper, we are able\nto derive some upper bounds for codes with relatively large distance and\nlocality assuming that (r + 1)|n and recovery sets are disjoint.",

    "abstract": "Recently, transformer and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architectures have\nachieved impressive results on various vision tasks. However, how to\neffectively combine those operators to form high-performance hybrid visual\narchitectures still remains a challenge. In this work, we study the learnable\ncombination of convolution, transformer, and MLP by proposing a novel unified\narchitecture search approach. Our approach contains two key designs to achieve\nthe search for high-performance networks. First, we model the very different\nsearchable operators in a unified form, and thus enable the operators to be\ncharacterized with the same set of configuration parameters. In this way, the\noverall search space size is significantly reduced, and the total search cost\nbecomes affordable. Second, we propose context-aware downsampling modules\n(DSMs) to mitigate the gap between the different types of operators. Our\nproposed DSMs are able to better adapt features from different types of\noperators, which is important for identifying high-performance hybrid\narchitectures. Finally, we integrate configurable operators and DSMs into a\nunified search space and search with a Reinforcement Learning-based search\nalgorithm to fully explore the optimal combination of the operators. To this\nend, we search a baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models,\nnamed UniNets, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous\nConvNets and Transformers.

    "abstract": "Image retouching, aiming to regenerate the visually pleasing renditions of\ngiven images, is a subjective task where the users are with different aesthetic\nsensations. Most existing methods deploy a deterministic model to learn the\nretouching style from a specific expert, making it less flexible to meet\ndiverse subjective preferences. Besides, the intrinsic diversity of an expert\ndue to the targeted processing on different images is also deficiently\ndescribed. To circumvent such issues, we propose to learn diverse image\nretouching with normalizing flow-based architectures. Unlike current flow-based\nmethods which directly generate the output image, we argue that learning in a\nstyle domain could (i) disentangle the retouching styles from the image\ncontent, (ii) lead to a stable style presentation form, and (iii) avoid the\nspatial disharmony effects. For obtaining meaningful image tone style\nrepresentations, a joint-training pipeline is delicately designed, which is\ncomposed of a style encoder, a conditional RetouchNet, and the image tone style\nnormalizing flow (TSFlow) module. In particular, the style encoder predicts the\ntarget style representation of an input image, which serves as the conditional\ninformation in the RetouchNet for retouching, while the TSFlow maps the style\nrepresentation vector into a Gaussian distribution in the forward pass. After\ntraining, the TSFlow can generate diverse image tone style vectors by sampling\nfrom the Gaussian distribution. Extensive experiments on MIT-Adobe FiveK and\nPPR10K datasets show that our proposed method performs favorably against\nstate-of-the-art methods and is effective in generating diverse results to\nsatisfy different human aesthetic preferences.

In this\npaper, we propose a method called synergistic self-supervised and quantization\nlearning (SSQL) to pretrain quantization-friendly self-supervised models\nfacilitating downstream deployment. SSQL contrasts the features of the\nquantized and full precision models in a self-supervised fashion, where the\nbit-width for the quantized model is randomly selected in each step. SSQL not\nonly significantly improves the accuracy when quantized to lower bit-widths,\nbut also boosts the accuracy of full precision models in most cases.

However, the easy\nannotations in synthetic domains bring the downside effect of synthetic-to-real\n(Sim2Real) domain gap. In this work, we aim to address this issue in the task\nsetting of Sim2Real, unsupervised domain adaptation for category-level 6D\nobject pose and size estimation. We propose a method that is built upon a novel\nDeep Prior Deformation Network, shortened as DPDN. DPDN learns to deform\nfeatures of categorical shape priors to match those of object observations, and\nis thus able to establish deep correspondence in the feature space for direct\nregression of object poses and sizes. To reduce the Sim2Real domain gap, we\nformulate a novel self-supervised objective upon DPDN via consistency learning;\nmore specifically, we apply two rigid transformations to each object\nobservation in parallel, and feed them into DPDN respectively to yield dual\nsets of predictions; on top of the parallel learning, an inter-consistency term\nis employed to keep cross consistency between dual predictions for improving\nthe sensitivity of DPDN to pose changes, while individual intra-consistency\nones are used to enforce self-adaptation within each learning itself. We train\nDPDN on both training sets of the synthetic CAMERA25 and real-world REAL275\ndatasets; our results outperform the existing methods on REAL275 test set under\nboth the unsupervised and supervised settings. Ablation studies also verify the\nefficacy of our designs. Our code is released publicly at\nhttps://github.com/JiehongLin/Self-DPDN.",

    "abstract": "NeuroEvolution automates the generation of Artificial Neural Networks through\nthe application of techniques from Evolutionary Computation. The main goal of\nthese approaches is to build models that maximize predictive performance,\nsometimes with an additional objective of minimizing computational complexity.\nAlthough the evolved models achieve competitive results performance-wise, their\nrobustness to adversarial examples, which becomes a concern in\nsecurity-critical scenarios, has received limited attention. In this paper, we\nevaluate the adversarial robustness of models found by two prominent\nNeuroEvolution approaches on the CIFAR-10 image classification task: DENSER and\nNSGA-Net. Since the models are publicly available, we consider white-box\nuntargeted attacks, where the perturbations are bounded by either the L2 or the\nLinfinity-norm. Similarly to manually-designed networks, our results show that\nwhen the evolved models are attacked with iterative methods, their accuracy\nusually drops to, or close to, zero under both distance metrics. The DENSER\nmodel is an exception to this trend, showing some resistance under the L2\nthreat model, where its accuracy only drops from 93.70% to 18.10% even with\niterative attacks. Additionally, we analyzed the impact of pre-processing\napplied to the data before the first layer of the network. Our observations\nsuggest that some of these techniques can exacerbate the perturbations added to\nthe original inputs, potentially harming robustness. Thus, this choice should\nnot be neglected when automatically designing networks for applications where\nadversarial attacks are prone to occur.",

The\nimage representation is then used in CNN to detect the signature of an\nappliance from aggregated data.

    "abstract": "We present a novel direct integral pseudospectral (PS) method (a direct IPS\nmethod) for solving a class of continuous-time infinite-horizon optimal control\nproblems (IHOCs). The method transforms the IHOCs into finite-horizon optimal\ncontrol problems (FHOCs) in their integral forms by means of certain parametric\nmappings, which are then approximated by finite-dimensional nonlinear\nprogramming problems (NLPs) through rational collocations based on Gegenbauer\npolynomials and Gegenbauer-Gauss-Radau (GGR) points. The paper also analyzes\nthe interplay between the parametric maps, barycentric rational collocations\nbased on Gegenbauer polynomials and GGR points, and the convergence properties\nof the collocated solutions for IHOCs. Some novel formulas for the construction\nof the rational interpolation weights and the GGR-based integration and\ndifferentiation matrices in barycentric-trigonometric forms are derived. A\nrigorous study on the error and convergence of the proposed method is\npresented. A stability analysis based on the Lebesgue constant for GGR-based\nrational interpolation is investigated. Two easy-to-implement pseudocodes of\ncomputational algorithms for computing the barycentric-trigonometric rational\nweights are described. Two illustrative test examples are presented to support\nthe theoretical results. We show that the proposed collocation method leveraged\nwith a fast and accurate NLP solver converges exponentially to near-optimal\napproximations for a coarse collocation mesh grid size. The paper also shows\nthat typical direct spectral/PS- and IPS-methods based on classical Jacobi\npolynomials and certain parametric maps usually diverge as the number of\ncollocation points grow large, if the computations are carried out using\nfloating-point arithmetic and the discretizations use a single mesh grid\nwhether they are of Gauss/Gauss-Radau (GR) type or equally-spaced.",

The accuracy of AlphaFold2, a frontier end-to-end\nstructure prediction system, is already close to that of the experimental\ndetermination techniques.

The cost of\nrunning the original AlphaFold2 is expensive for most individuals and\ninstitutions. Therefore, reducing this cost could accelerate the development of\nlife science. We implement AlphaFold2 using PaddlePaddle, namely HelixFold, to\nimprove training and inference speed and reduce memory consumption. The\nperformance is improved by operator fusion, tensor fusion, and hybrid\nparallelism computation, while the memory is optimized through Recompute,\nBFloat16, and memory read/write in-place.

Then, we\nemploy the line-point incidence matrix and Johnson bounds for constant weight\ncodes to derive new improved bounds on the code length, which are tighter than\nknown results. Finally, by using some techniques of finite field and finite\ngeometry, we give some new constructions of Singleton-optimal LRCs, which have\nlarger length than previous ones.",

    "abstract": "In real-world robotics applications, Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents are\noften unable to generalise to environment variations that were not observed\nduring training. This issue is intensified for image-based RL where a change in\none variable, such as the background colour, can change many pixels in the\nimage, and in turn can change all values in the agent's internal representation\nof the image. To learn more robust representations, we introduce TEmporal\nDisentanglement (TED), a self-supervised auxiliary task that leads to\ndisentangled representations using the sequential nature of RL observations. We\nfind empirically that RL algorithms with TED as an auxiliary task adapt more\nquickly to changes in environment variables with continued training compared to\nstate-of-the-art representation learning methods. Due to the disentangled\nstructure of the representation, we also find that policies trained with TED\ngeneralise better to unseen values of variables irrelevant to the task (e.g.\nbackground colour) as well as unseen values of variables that affect the\noptimal policy (e.g. goal positions).",

Finding a shortest or a short\nsynchronizing word is a central computational problem in the theory of\nsynchronizing automata and is applied in other areas such as model-based\ntesting and the theory of codes. Because the problem of finding a shortest\nsynchronizing word is computationally hard, among \\emph{exact} algorithms only\nexponential ones are known.

Many\nprior works perform audio-visual integration and interaction in an early or\nintermediate manner, yet overlooking the modality heterogeneousness over the\nweakly-supervised setting. In this paper, we analyze the modality asynchrony\nand undifferentiated instances phenomena of the multiple instance learning\n(MIL) procedure, and further investigate its negative impact on\nweakly-supervised audio-visual learning. To address these issues, we propose a\nmodality-aware contrastive instance learning with self-distillation (MACIL-SD)\nstrategy. Specifically, we leverage a lightweight two-stream network to\ngenerate audio and visual bags, in which unimodal background, violent, and\nnormal instances are clustered into semi-bags in an unsupervised way. Then\naudio and visual violent semi-bag representations are assembled as positive\npairs, and violent semi-bags are combined with background and normal instances\nin the opposite modality as contrastive negative pairs. Furthermore, a\nself-distillation module is applied to transfer unimodal visual knowledge to\nthe audio-visual model, which alleviates noises and closes the semantic gap\nbetween unimodal and multimodal features. Experiments show that our framework\noutperforms previous methods with lower complexity on the large-scale\nXD-Violence dataset.

This poses a distinct challenge: Can a visual neural\nnetwork be designed to infer as fast as CNNs and perform as powerful as ViTs?\nRecent works have tried to design CNN-Transformer hybrid architectures to\naddress this issue, yet the overall performance of these works is far away from\nsatisfactory. To end these, we propose a next generation vision Transformer for\nefficient deployment in realistic industrial scenarios, namely Next-ViT, which\ndominates both CNNs and ViTs from the perspective of latency/accuracy\ntrade-off. In this work, the Next Convolution Block (NCB) and Next Transformer\nBlock (NTB) are respectively developed to capture local and global information\nwith deployment-friendly mechanisms. Then, Next Hybrid Strategy (NHS) is\ndesigned to stack NCB and NTB in an efficient hybrid paradigm, which boosts\nperformance in various downstream tasks. Extensive experiments show that\nNext-ViT significantly outperforms existing CNNs, ViTs and CNN-Transformer\nhybrid architectures with respect to the latency/accuracy trade-off across\nvarious vision tasks. On TensorRT, Next-ViT surpasses ResNet by 5.4 mAP (from\n40.4 to 45.8) on COCO detection and 8.2% mIoU (from 38.8% to 47.0%) on ADE20K\nsegmentation under similar latency.

Unlike the existing metric that requires evaluating the\nempirical transferability on auxiliary tasks, our metrics are auxiliary-free\nsuch that they can be computed much more efficiently. Specifically, F-OTCE\nestimates transferability by first solving an Optimal Transport (OT) problem\nbetween source and target distributions, and then uses the optimal coupling to\ncompute the Negative Conditional Entropy between source and target labels. It\ncan also serve as a loss function to maximize the transferability of the source\nmodel before finetuning on the target task.

Namely, we focus on the classes of values that can\nrepresent very general alternatives to the solution of the information\ndecomposition problem, such as random-order values or sharing values. We extend\nthe axiomatic characterization of some classes of values that were known only\nfor the standard coalitional games.",

    "abstract": "With privacy legislation empowering users with the right to be forgotten, it\nhas become essential to make a model forget about some of its training data. We\nexplore the problem of removing any client's contribution in federated learning\n(FL). During FL rounds, each client performs local training to learn a model\nthat minimizes the empirical loss on their private data. We propose to perform\nunlearning at the client (to be erased) by reversing the learning process,\ni.e., training a model to \\emph{maximize} the local empirical loss. In\nparticular, we formulate the unlearning problem as a constrained maximization\nproblem by restricting to an $\\ell_2$-norm ball around a suitably chosen\nreference model to help retain some knowledge learnt from the other clients'\ndata. This allows the client to use projected gradient descent to perform\nunlearning. The method does neither require global access to the data used for\ntraining nor the history of the parameter updates to be stored by the\naggregator (server) or any of the clients. Experiments on the MNIST dataset\nshow that the proposed unlearning method is efficient and effective.",

Observer based sideslip\nestimates are combined with heading error in the kinematic controller to\nprovide feedforward slip compensation. Path following error is compensated by a\ncontinuous Variable Structure Controller (VSC) using speed-based path manifolds\nto balance graceful motion and error convergence. Resulting yaw rate commands\nare used by a backstepping dynamic controller to generate steering rate\ncommands. A High Gain Observer (HGO) estimates sideslip and yaw rate for output\nfeedback control. Stability analysis of the output feedback controller is\nprovided, and peaking is resolved. The work focuses on lateral control alone so\nthat the steering controller can be combined with other speed controllers.\nField results provide comparisons to related approaches demonstrating\ngracefulness and accuracy in different complex scenarios with varied weather\nconditions and perturbations.",

However, data are often\nscattered in data silos with privacy concerns, so performing centralized data\nstorage and retrieval is not always possible. Leveraging the concept of\nfederated learning (FL) to perform deep hashing is a recent research trend.\nHowever, existing frameworks mostly rely on the aggregation of the local deep\nhashing models, which are trained by performing similarity learning with local\nskewed data only. Therefore, they cannot work well for non-IID clients in a\nreal federated environment. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel\nfederated hashing framework that enables participating clients to jointly train\nthe shared deep hashing model by leveraging the prototypical hash codes for\neach class. Globally, the transmission of global prototypes with only one\nprototypical hash code per class will minimize the impact of communication cost\nand privacy risk. Locally, the use of global prototypes are maximized by\njointly training a discriminator network and the local hashing network.\nExtensive experiments on benchmark datasets are conducted to demonstrate that\nour method can significantly improve the performance of the deep hashing model\nin the federated environments with non-IID data distributions.",

The\nexisting works treat the temporal axis as a simple extension of spatial axes,\nfocusing on shortening the spatio-temporal sequence by either generic pooling\nor local windowing without utilizing temporal redundancy.\nHowever, videos naturally contain redundant information between neighboring\nframes; thereby, we could potentially suppress attention on visually similar\nframes in a dilated manner. Based on this hypothesis, we propose the LAPS, a\nlong-term ``\\textbf{\\textit{Leap Attention}}'' (LA), short-term\n``\\textbf{\\textit{Periodic Shift}}'' (\\textit{P}-Shift) module for video\ntransformers, with $(2TN^2)$ complexity.

    "abstract": "A growing body of research has been dedicated to DL model testing. However,\nthere is still limited work on testing DL libraries, which serve as the\nfoundations for building, training, and running DL models. Prior work on\nfuzzing DL libraries can only generate tests for APIs which have been invoked\nby documentation examples, developer tests, or DL models, leaving a large\nnumber of APIs untested. In this paper, we propose DeepREL, the first approach\nto automatically inferring relational APIs for more effective DL library\nfuzzing. Our basic hypothesis is that for a DL library under test, there may\nexist a number of APIs sharing similar input parameters and outputs; in this\nway, we can easily \"borrow\" test inputs from invoked APIs to test other\nrelational APIs. Furthermore, we formalize the notion of value equivalence and\nstatus equivalence for relational APIs to serve as the oracle for effective bug\nfinding. We have implemented DeepREL as a fully automated end-to-end relational\nAPI inference and fuzzing technique for DL libraries, which 1) automatically\ninfers potential API relations based on API syntactic or semantic information,\n2) synthesizes concrete test programs for invoking relational APIs, 3)\nvalidates the inferred relational APIs via representative test inputs, and\nfinally 4) performs fuzzing on the verified relational APIs to find potential\ninconsistencies. Our evaluation on two of the most popular DL libraries,\nPyTorch and TensorFlow, demonstrates that DeepREL can cover 157% more APIs than\nstate-of-the-art FreeFuzz. To date, DeepREL has detected 162 bugs in total,\nwith 106 already confirmed by the developers as previously unknown bugs.\nSurprisingly, DeepREL has detected 13.5% of the high-priority bugs for the\nentire PyTorch issue-tracking system in a three-month period. Also, besides the\n162 code bugs, we have also detected 14 documentation bugs (all confirmed).",

In MT, the sparse pseudo labels, offered by the final\npredictions of the teacher (e.g., after Non Maximum Suppression (NMS)\npost-processing), are adopted for the dense supervision for the student via\nhand-crafted label assignment. However, the sparse-to-dense paradigm\ncomplicates the pipeline of SSOD, and simultaneously neglects the powerful\ndirect, dense teacher supervision. In this paper, we attempt to directly\nleverage the dense guidance of teacher to supervise student training, i.e., the\ndense-to-dense paradigm. Specifically, we propose the Inverse NMS Clustering\n(INC) and Rank Matching (RM) to instantiate the dense supervision, without the\nwidely used, conventional sparse pseudo labels. INC leads the student to group\ncandidate boxes into clusters in NMS as the teacher does, which is implemented\nby learning grouping information revealed in NMS procedure of the teacher.\nAfter obtaining the same grouping scheme as the teacher via INC, the student\nfurther imitates the rank distribution of the teacher over clustered candidates\nthrough Rank Matching. With the proposed INC and RM, we integrate Dense Teacher\nGuidance into Semi-Supervised Object Detection (termed DTG-SSOD), successfully\nabandoning sparse pseudo labels and enabling more informative learning on\nunlabeled data. On COCO benchmark, our DTG-SSOD achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance under various labelling ratios.

However, for highly heterogeneous problems,\nwhere the coefficient function is varying rapidly on several possibly\nnon-separated scales, the condition number of the preconditioned system\ngenerally depends on the contrast of the coefficient function leading to a\ndeterioration of convergence. Enhancing the methods by coarse spaces\nconstructed from suitable local eigenvalue problems, also denoted as adaptive\nor spectral coarse spaces, restores robust, contrast-independent convergence.\nHowever, these eigenvalue problems typically rely on non-algebraic information,\nsuch that the adaptive coarse spaces cannot be constructed from the fully\nassembled system matrix. In this paper, a novel algebraic adaptive coarse\nspace, which relies on the a-orthogonal decomposition of (local) finite element\n(FE) spaces into functions that solve the partial differential equation (PDE)\nwith some trace and FE functions that are zero on the boundary, is proposed. In\nparticular, the basis is constructed from eigenmodes of two types of local\neigenvalue problems associated with the edges of the domain decomposition. To\napproximate functions that solve the PDE locally, we employ a transfer\neigenvalue problem, which has originally been proposed for the construction of\noptimal local approximation spaces for multiscale methods. In addition, we make\nuse of a Dirichlet eigenvalue problem that is a slight modification of the\nNeumann eigenvalue problem used in the adaptive generalized Dryja-Smith-Widlund\n(AGDSW) coarse space.

    "abstract": "Software programming requires both API reference (know-what) knowledge and\nprogramming task (know-how) knowledge. Lots of programming know-what and\nknow-how knowledge is documented in text, for example, API reference\ndocumentation and programming tutorials. To improve knowledge accessibility and\nusage, several recent studies use Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to\nconstruct API know-what knowledge graph (API-KG) and programming task know-how\nknowledge graph (Task-KG) from software documentation. Although being\npromising, current API-KG and Task-KG are independent of each other, and thus\nare void of inherent connections between the two types of knowledge. Our\nempirical study on Stack Overflow questions confirms that only 36\\% of the API\nusage problems can be answered by the know-how or the know-what knowledge\nalone, while the rest questions require a fusion of both. Inspired by this\nobservation, we make the first attempt to fuse API-KG and Task-KG by API entity\nlinking. This fusion creates nine categories of API semantic relations and two\ntypes of task semantic relations which are not present in the stand-alone\nAPI-KG or Task-KG. According to the definitions of these new API and task\nsemantic relations, our approach dives deeper than the surface-level API\nlinking of API-KG and Task-KG, and infers nine categories of API semantic\nrelations from task descriptions and two types of task semantic relations with\nthe assistance of API-KG, which enrich the declaration or syntactic relations\nin the current API-KG and Task-KG. Our fused and semantically-enriched API-Task\nKG supports coherent API/Task-centric knowledge search by text or code queries.",

    "abstract": "How neural networks in the human brain represent commonsense knowledge, and\ncomplete related reasoning tasks is an important research topic in\nneuroscience, cognitive science, psychology, and artificial intelligence.\nAlthough the traditional artificial neural network using fixed-length vectors\nto represent symbols has gained good performance in some specific tasks, it is\nstill a black box that lacks interpretability, far from how humans perceive the\nworld. Inspired by the grandmother-cell hypothesis in neuroscience, this work\ninvestigates how population encoding and spiking timing-dependent plasticity\n(STDP) mechanisms can be integrated into the learning of spiking neural\nnetworks, and how a population of neurons can represent a symbol via guiding\nthe completion of sequential firing between different neuron populations. The\nneuron populations of different communities together constitute the entire\ncommonsense knowledge graph, forming a giant graph spiking neural network.\nMoreover, we introduced the Reward-modulated spiking timing-dependent\nplasticity (R-STDP) mechanism to simulate the biological reinforcement learning\nprocess and completed the related reasoning tasks accordingly, achieving\ncomparable accuracy and faster convergence speed than the graph convolutional\nartificial neural networks. For the fields of neuroscience and cognitive\nscience, the work in this paper provided the foundation of computational\nmodeling for further exploration of the way the human brain represents\ncommonsense knowledge. For the field of artificial intelligence, this paper\nindicated the exploration direction for realizing a more robust and\ninterpretable neural network by constructing a commonsense knowledge\nrepresentation and reasoning spiking neural networks with solid biological\nplausibility.",

    "abstract": "Dependency graphs have proven to be a very successful model to represent the\nsyntactic structure of sentences of human languages. In these graphs, widely\naccepted to be trees, vertices are words and arcs connect\nsyntactically-dependent words. The tendency of these dependencies to be short\nhas been demonstrated using random baselines for the sum of the lengths of the\nedges or its variants. A ubiquitous baseline is the expected sum in projective\norderings (wherein edges do not cross and the root word of the sentence is not\ncovered by any edge). It was shown that said expected value can be computed in\n$O(n)$ time. In this article we focus on planar orderings (where the root word\ncan be covered) and present two main results. First, we show the relationship\nbetween the expected sum in planar arrangements and the expected sum in\nprojective arrangements. Second, we also derive a $O(n)$-time algorithm to\ncalculate the expected value of the sum of edge lengths. These two results stem\nfrom another contribution of the present article, namely a characterization of\nplanarity that, given a sentence, yields either the number of planar\npermutations or an efficient algorithm to generate uniformly random planar\npermutations of the words.

    "abstract": "Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods lack ground truth. In its\nplace, method developers have relied on axioms to determine desirable\nproperties for their explanations' behavior. For high stakes uses of machine\nlearning that require explainability, it is not sufficient to rely on axioms as\nthe implementation, or its usage, can fail to live up to the ideal. As a\nresult, there exists active research on validating the performance of XAI\nmethods. The need for validation is especially magnified in domains with a\nreliance on XAI. A procedure frequently used to assess their utility, and to\nsome extent their fidelity, is an ablation study. By perturbing the input\nvariables in rank order of importance, the goal is to assess the sensitivity of\nthe model's performance. Perturbing important variables should correlate with\nlarger decreases in measures of model capability than perturbing less important\nfeatures. While the intent is clear, the actual implementation details have not\nbeen studied rigorously for tabular data. Using five datasets, three XAI\nmethods, four baselines, and three perturbations, we aim to show 1) how varying\nperturbations and adding simple guardrails can help to avoid potentially flawed\nconclusions, 2) how treatment of categorical variables is an important\nconsideration in both post-hoc explainability and ablation studies, and 3) how\nto identify useful baselines for XAI methods and viable perturbations for\nablation studies.",

    "abstract": "Human affect and mental state estimation in an automated manner, face a\nnumber of difficulties, including learning from labels with poor or no temporal\nresolution, learning from few datasets with little data (often due to\nconfidentiality constraints) and, (very) long, in-the-wild videos. For these\nreasons, deep learning methodologies tend to overfit, that is, arrive at latent\nrepresentations with poor generalisation performance on the final regression\ntask. To overcome this, in this work, we introduce two complementary\ncontributions. First, we introduce a novel relational loss for multilabel\nregression and ordinal problems that regularises learning and leads to better\ngeneralisation. The proposed loss uses label vector inter-relational\ninformation to learn better latent representations by aligning batch label\ndistances to the distances in the latent feature space. Second, we utilise a\ntwo-stage attention architecture that estimates a target for each clip by using\nfeatures from the neighbouring clips as temporal context. We evaluate the\nproposed methodology on both continuous affect and schizophrenia severity\nestimation problems, as there are methodological and contextual parallels\nbetween the two. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methodology\noutperforms all baselines. In the domain of schizophrenia, the proposed\nmethodology outperforms previous state-of-the-art by a large margin, achieving\na PCC of up to 78% performance close to that of human experts (85%) and much\nhigher than previous works (uplift of up to 40%). In the case of affect\nrecognition, we outperform previous vision-based methods in terms of CCC on\nboth the OMG and the AMIGOS datasets. Specifically for AMIGOS, we outperform\nprevious SoTA CCC for both arousal and valence by 9% and 13% respectively, and\nin the OMG dataset we outperform previous vision works by up to 5% for both\narousal and valence.",

To bridge\nthe gap, we conduct a systematic research to assess and improve the quality of\nfour benchmark datasets widely used for code summarization tasks.

The results show that these data\npreprocessing noises widely exist in all four benchmark datasets, and removing\nthese noisy data leads to a significant improvement on the performance of code\nsummarization.

    "abstract": "Video instance segmentation (VIS) aims at classifying, segmenting and\ntracking object instances in video sequences. Recent transformer-based neural\nnetworks have demonstrated their powerful capability of modeling\nspatio-temporal correlations for the VIS task. Relying on video- or clip-level\ninput, they suffer from high latency and computational cost. We propose a\nrobust context fusion network to tackle VIS in an online fashion, which\npredicts instance segmentation frame-by-frame with a few preceding frames. To\nacquire the precise and temporal-consistent prediction for each frame\nefficiently, the key idea is to fuse effective and compact context from\nreference frames into the target frame. Considering the different effects of\nreference and target frames on the target prediction, we first summarize\ncontextual features through importance-aware compression. A transformer encoder\nis adopted to fuse the compressed context. Then, we leverage an\norder-preserving instance embedding to convey the identity-aware information\nand correspond the identities to predicted instance masks. We demonstrate that\nour robust fusion network achieves the best performance among existing online\nVIS methods and is even better than previously published clip-level methods on\nthe Youtube-VIS 2019 and 2021 benchmarks. In addition, visual objects often\nhave acoustic signatures that are naturally synchronized with them in\naudio-bearing video recordings. By leveraging the flexibility of our context\nfusion network on multi-modal data, we further investigate the influence of\naudios on the video-dense prediction task, which has never been discussed in\nexisting works.

In\nthis paper we investigate this system's performance thoroughly on a set of\nregression problems and compare it against XCSF, a prominent rule-based\nlearning system. We find the overall results of SupRB's evaluation comparable\nto XCSF's while allowing easier control of model structure and showing a\nsubstantially smaller sensitivity to random seeds and data splits.

    "abstract": "Learning dynamic user preference has become an increasingly important\ncomponent for many online platforms (e.g., video-sharing sites, e-commerce\nsystems) to make sequential recommendations. Previous works have made many\nefforts to model item-item transitions over user interaction sequences, based\non various architectures, e.g., recurrent neural networks and self-attention\nmechanism. Recently emerged graph neural networks also serve as useful backbone\nmodels to capture item dependencies in sequential recommendation scenarios.\nDespite their effectiveness, existing methods have far focused on item sequence\nrepresentation with singular type of interactions, and thus are limited to\ncapture dynamic heterogeneous relational structures between users and items\n(e.g., page view, add-to-favorite, purchase). To tackle this challenge, we\ndesign a Multi-Behavior Hypergraph-enhanced Transformer framework (MBHT) to\ncapture both short-term and long-term cross-type behavior dependencies.\nSpecifically, a multi-scale Transformer is equipped with low-rank\nself-attention to jointly encode behavior-aware sequential patterns from\nfine-grained and coarse-grained levels. Additionally, we incorporate the global\nmulti-behavior dependency into the hypergraph neural architecture to capture\nthe hierarchical long-range item correlations in a customized manner.\nExperimental results demonstrate the superiority of our MBHT over various\nstate-of-the-art recommendation solutions across different settings. Further\nablation studies validate the effectiveness of our model design and benefits of\nthe new MBHT framework. Our implementation code is released at:\nhttps://github.com/yuh-yang/MBHT-KDD22.",

    "abstract": "Recent works have shown how the reasoning capabilities of Large Language\nModels (LLMs) can be applied to domains beyond natural language processing,\nsuch as planning and interaction for robots. These embodied problems require an\nagent to understand many semantic aspects of the world: the repertoire of\nskills available, how these skills influence the world, and how changes to the\nworld map back to the language. LLMs planning in embodied environments need to\nconsider not just what skills to do, but also how and when to do them - answers\nthat change over time in response to the agent's own choices. In this work, we\ninvestigate to what extent LLMs used in such embodied contexts can reason over\nsources of feedback provided through natural language, without any additional\ntraining. We propose that by leveraging environment feedback, LLMs are able to\nform an inner monologue that allows them to more richly process and plan in\nrobotic control scenarios. We investigate a variety of sources of feedback,\nsuch as success detection, scene description, and human interaction. We find\nthat closed-loop language feedback significantly improves high-level\ninstruction completion on three domains, including simulated and real table top\nrearrangement tasks and long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks in a kitchen\nenvironment in the real world.",

    "abstract": "Abstraction logic is a new logic, serving as a foundation of mathematics. It\ncombines features of both predicate logic and higher-order logic: abstraction\nlogic can be viewed both as higher-order logic minus static types as well as\npredicate logic plus operators and variable binding. We argue that abstraction\nlogic is the best foundational logic possible because it maximises both\nsimplicity and practical expressivity. This argument is supported by the\nobservation that abstraction logic has simpler terms and a simpler notion of\nproof than all other general logics. At the same time, abstraction logic can\nformalise both intuitionistic and classical abstraction logic, and is sound and\ncomplete for these logics and all other logics extending deduction logic with\nequality.",

    "title": "Making Python Code Idiomatic by Automatic Refactoring Non-Idiomatic  Python Code with Pythonic Idioms",
    "abstract": "Compared to other programming languages (e.g., Java), Python has more idioms\nto make Python code concise and efficient. Although pythonic idioms are well\naccepted in the Python community, Python programmers are often faced with many\nchallenges in using them, for example, being unaware of certain pythonic idioms\nor do not know how to use them properly. Based on an analysis of 7,638 Python\nrepositories on GitHub, we find that non-idiomatic Python code that can be\nimplemented with pythonic idioms occurs frequently and widely. Unfortunately,\nthere is no tool for automatically refactoring such non-idiomatic code into\nidiomatic code. In this paper, we design and implement an automatic refactoring\ntool to make Python code idiomatic. We identify nine pythonic idioms by\nsystematically contrasting the abstract syntax grammar of Python and Java. Then\nwe define the syntactic patterns for detecting non-idiomatic code for each\npythonic idiom. Finally, we devise atomic AST-rewriting operations and\nrefactoring steps to refactor non-idiomatic code into idiomatic code. We test\nand review over 4,115 refactorings applied to 1,065 Python projects from\nGitHub, and submit 90 pull requests for the 90 randomly sampled refactorings to\n84 projects. These evaluations confirm the high-accuracy, practicality and\nusefulness of our refactoring tool on real-world Python code. Our refactoring\ntool can be accessed at 47.242.131.128:5000.",

Htex\nbuilds upon the insight that halfedges encode an intrinsic triangulation for\npolygon meshes, where each halfedge spans a unique triangle with direct\nadjacency information. Rather than storing a separate texture per face of the\ninput mesh as is done by previous parameterization-free texturing methods, Htex\nstores a square texture for each halfedge and its twin. We show that this\nsimple change from face to halfedge induces two important properties for high\nperformance parameterization-free texturing. First, Htex natively supports\narbitrary polygons without requiring dedicated code for, e.g, non-quad faces.\nSecond, Htex leads to a straightforward and efficient GPU implementation that\nuses only three texture-fetches per halfedge to produce continuous texturing\nacross the entire mesh.

Snow\nimages have complex degradations and are cluttered over clean images, changing\nthe distribution of clean images. The previous methods based on CNNs are\nchallenging to remove perfectly in restoring snow scenes due to their local\ninductive biases' lack of a specific global modeling ability. In this paper, we\napply the vision transformer to the task of snow removal from a single image.\nSpecifically, we propose a parallel network architecture split along the\nchannel, performing local feature refinement and global information modeling\nseparately. We utilize a channel shuffle operation to combine their respective\nstrengths to enhance network performance. Second, we propose the MSP module,\nwhich utilizes multi-scale avgpool to aggregate information of different sizes\nand simultaneously performs multi-scale projection self-attention on multi-head\nself-attention to improve the representation ability of the model under\ndifferent scale degradations. Finally, we design a lightweight and simple local\ncapture module, which can refine the local capture capability of the model.\nIn the experimental part, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our method. We compared the previous snow removal methods on\nthree snow scene datasets. The experimental results show that our method\nsurpasses the state-of-the-art methods with fewer parameters and computation.\nWe achieve substantial growth by 1.99dB and SSIM 0.03 on the CSD test dataset.\nOn the SRRS and Snow100K datasets, we also increased PSNR by 2.47dB and 1.62dB\ncompared with the Transweather approach and improved by 0.03 in SSIM.

    "abstract": "Off-line optimal planning of trajectories for redundant robots along\nprescribed task space paths is usually broken down into two consecutive\nprocesses: first, the task space path is inverted to obtain a joint-space path,\nthen, the latter is parametrized with a time law. If the two processes are\nseparated, they cannot optimize the same objective function, ultimately\nproviding sub-optimal results. In this paper, a unified approach is presented\nwhere dynamic programming is the underlying optimization technique. Its\nflexibility allows accommodating arbitrary constraints and objective functions,\nthus providing a generic framework for optimal planning of real systems. To\ndemonstrate its applicability to a real world scenario, the framework is\ninstantiated for time-optimality. Compared to numerical solvers, the proposed\nmethodology provides visibility of the underlying resolution process, allowing\nfor further analyses beyond the computation of the optimal trajectory. The\neffectiveness of the framework is demonstrated on a real 7-degrees-of-freedom\nserial chain. The issues associated with the execution of optimal trajectories\non a real controller are also discussed and addressed. The experiments show\nthat the proposed framework is able to effectively exploit kinematic redundancy\nto optimize the performance index defined at planning level and generate\nfeasible trajectories that can be executed on real hardware with satisfactory\nresults.",

    "abstract": "Congestion control algorithms rely on a variety of congestion signals (packet\nloss, Explicit Congestion Notification, delay, etc.) to achieve fast\nconvergence, high utilization, and fairness among flows. A key limitation of\nthese congestion signals is that they are either late in feedback or they incur\nsignificant overheads. An ideal congestion control must discover any available\nbandwidth in the network, detect congestion as soon as link utilization\napproaches full capacity, and react timely to avoid queuing and packet drops,\nwithout significant overheads. To this end, this work proposes Scout service\nthat leverages priority queues to infer bandwidth availability and link\nbusyness at the host. The key observation here is that as the high priority\nqueue (HPQ) gets busier, the low priority queue (LPQ) is served less.\nTherefore, the state of the link can be observed from the LPQ and any\ncongestion can be detected several RTTs earlier than observing the HPQ. We\npropose a new transport protocol, Double-Window Transmission Control Protocol\n(DWTCP) that builds upon the Scout service to dynamically adjust its congestion\nwindow.

We gathered and annotated artworks with\nadvanced and art-specific information to create a completely unique database\nthat was used to train our models. With this information, we built a proximity\ngraph between artworks. Similarly, we used NLP techniques to characterize the\npractices of the artists and we extracted information from exhibitions and\nother event history to create a proximity graph between artists. The power of\ngraph analysis enables us to provide an artwork recommendation system based on\na combination of visual and contextual information from artworks and artists.\nAfter an assessment by a team of art specialists, we get an average final\nrating of 75% of meaningful artworks when compared to their professional\nevaluations.",

    "title": "Dynamic Gradient Reactivation for Backward Compatible Person  Re-identification",
    "abstract": "We study the backward compatible problem for person re-identification\n(Re-ID), which aims to constrain the features of an updated new model to be\ncomparable with the existing features from the old model in galleries. Most of\nthe existing works adopt distillation-based methods, which focus on pushing new\nfeatures to imitate the distribution of the old ones. However, the\ndistillation-based methods are intrinsically sub-optimal since it forces the\nnew feature space to imitate the inferior old feature space. To address this\nissue, we propose the Ranking-based Backward Compatible Learning (RBCL), which\ndirectly optimizes the ranking metric between new features and old features.\nDifferent from previous methods, RBCL only pushes the new features to find\nbest-ranking positions in the old feature space instead of strictly alignment,\nand is in line with the ultimate goal of backward retrieval. However, the sharp\nsigmoid function used to make the ranking metric differentiable also incurs the\ngradient vanish issue, therefore stems the ranking refinement during the later\nperiod of training. To address this issue, we propose the Dynamic Gradient\nReactivation (DGR), which can reactivate the suppressed gradients by adding\ndynamic computed constant during forward step. To further help targeting the\nbest-ranking positions, we include the Neighbor Context Agents (NCAs) to\napproximate the entire old feature space during training. Unlike previous works\nwhich only test on the in-domain settings, we make the first attempt to\nintroduce the cross-domain settings (including both supervised and\nunsupervised), which are more meaningful and difficult. The experimental\nresults on all five settings show that the proposed RBCL outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-art methods by large margins under all settings.",

Many follow-up results either improved\nthe space \\emph{or} the query time of the oracles while having the same,\nsometimes worst, dependency on $1/\\epsilon$. Kawarabayashi, Sommer, and Thorup\n[SODA'13] were the first to improve the dependency on $1/\\epsilon$ from\nquadratic to nearly linear (at the cost of $\\log^*(n)$ factors). It is\nplausible to conjecture that the linear dependency on $1/\\epsilon$ is optimal:\nfor many known distance-related problems in planar graphs, it was proved that\nthe dependency on $1/\\epsilon$ is at least linear.\nIn this work, we disprove this conjecture by reducing the dependency of the\nspace-query product on $1/\\epsilon$ from linear all the way down to\n\\emph{subpolynomial} $(1/\\epsilon)^{o(1)}$.

Consider this partition into positive and negative groups as the\ndescription of a partially defined Boolean function; the data is then processed\nto identify a subset of attributes, whose values may be used to characterize\nthe observations of the positive groups against those of the negative group.\nLAD constitutes an interesting rule-based learning alternative to classic\nstatistical learning techniques and has many practical applications.\nNevertheless, the computation of group characterization may be costly,\ndepending on the properties of the data instances. A major aim of our work is\nto provide effective tools for speeding up the computations, by computing some\n\\emph{a priori} probability that a given set of attributes does characterize\nthe positive and negative groups. To this effect, we propose several models for\nrepresenting the data set of observations, according to the information we have\non it. These models, and the probabilities they allow us to compute, are also\nhelpful for quickly assessing some properties of the real data at hand;\nfurthermore they may help us to better analyze and understand the computational\ndifficulties encountered by solving methods.\nOnce our models have been established, the mathematical tools for computing\nprobabilities come from Analytic Combinatorics. They allow us to express the\ndesired probabilities as ratios of generating functions coefficients, which\nthen provide a quick computation of their numerical values. A further,\nlong-range goal of this paper is to show that the methods of Analytic\nCombinatorics can help in analyzing the performance of various algorithms in\nLAD and related fields.",

    "abstract": "Polypharmacy, defined as the use of multiple drugs together, is a standard\ntreatment method, especially for severe and chronic diseases. However, using\nmultiple drugs together may cause interactions between drugs. Drug-drug\ninteraction (DDI) is the activity that occurs when the impact of one drug\nchanges when combined with another. DDIs may obstruct, increase, or decrease\nthe intended effect of either drug or, in the worst-case scenario, create\nadverse side effects. While it is critical to detect DDIs on time, it is\ntimeconsuming and expensive to identify them in clinical trials due to their\nshort duration and many possible drug pairs to be considered for testing. As a\nresult, computational methods are needed for predicting DDIs. In this paper, we\npresent a novel heterogeneous graph attention model, HAN-DDI to predict\ndrug-drug interactions. We create a heterogeneous network of drugs with\ndifferent biological entities. Then, we develop a heterogeneous graph attention\nnetwork to learn DDIs using relations of drugs with other entities. It consists\nof an attention-based heterogeneous graph node encoder for obtaining drug node\nrepresentations and a decoder for predicting drug-drug interactions.

    "abstract": "Software analysis, debugging, and reverse engineering have a crucial impact\nin today's software industry. Efficient and stealthy debuggers are especially\nrelevant for malware analysis. However, existing debugging platforms fail to\naddress a transparent, effective, and high-performance low-level debugger due\nto their detectable fingerprints, complexity, and implementation restrictions.\nIn this paper, we present HyperDbg, a new hypervisor-assisted debugger for\nhigh-performance and stealthy debugging of user and kernel applications. To\naccomplish this, HyperDbg relies on state-of-the-art hardware features\navailable in today's CPUs, such as VT-x and extended page tables. In contrast\nto other widely used existing debuggers, we design HyperDbg using a custom\nhypervisor, making it independent of OS functionality or API. We propose\nhardware-based instruction-level emulation and OS-level API hooking via\nextended page tables to increase the stealthiness. Our results of the dynamic\nanalysis of 10,853 malware samples show that HyperDbg's stealthiness allows\ndebugging on average 22% and 26% more samples than WinDbg and x64dbg,\nrespectively. Moreover, in contrast to existing debuggers, HyperDbg is not\ndetected by any of the 13 tested packers and protectors. We improve the\nperformance over other debuggers by deploying a VMX-compatible script engine,\neliminating unnecessary context switches. Our experiment on three concrete\ndebugging scenarios shows that compared to WinDbg as the only kernel debugger,\nHyperDbg performs step-in, conditional breaks, and syscall recording, 2.98x,\n1319x, and 2018x faster, respectively. We finally show real-world applications,\nsuch as a 0-day analysis, structure reconstruction for reverse engineering,\nsoftware performance analysis, and code-coverage analysis.",

This paper introduces OpenMP Cluster\n(OMPC), a task-parallel model that extends OpenMP for cluster programming. OMPC\nleverages OpenMP's offloading standard to distribute annotated regions of code\nacross the nodes of a distributed system. To achieve that it hides MPI-based\ndata distribution and load-balancing mechanisms behind OpenMP task\ndependencies. Given its compliance with OpenMP, OMPC allows applications to use\nthe same programming model to exploit intra- and inter-node parallelism, thus\nsimplifying the development process and maintenance. We evaluated OMPC using\nTask Bench, a synthetic benchmark focused on task parallelism, comparing its\nperformance against other distributed runtimes. Experimental results show that\nOMPC can deliver up to 1.53x and 2.43x better performance than Charm++ on CCR\nand scalability experiments, respectively. Experiments also show that OMPC\nperformance weakly scales for both Task Bench and a real-world seismic imaging\napplication.",

    "abstract": "Lyric-to-melody generation, which generates melody according to given lyrics,\nis one of the most important automatic music composition tasks. With the rapid\ndevelopment of deep learning, previous works address this task with end-to-end\nneural network models. However, deep learning models cannot well capture the\nstrict but subtle relationships between lyrics and melodies, which compromises\nthe harmony between lyrics and generated melodies. In this paper, we propose\nReLyMe, a method that incorporates Relationships between Lyrics and Melodies\nfrom music theory to ensure the harmony between lyrics and melodies.\nSpecifically, we first introduce several principles that lyrics and melodies\nshould follow in terms of tone, rhythm, and structure relationships.

    "abstract": "The Multimodal Sentiment Analysis Challenge (MuSe) 2022 is dedicated to\nmultimodal sentiment and emotion recognition. For this year's challenge, we\nfeature three datasets: (i) the Passau Spontaneous Football Coach Humor\n(Passau-SFCH) dataset that contains audio-visual recordings of German football\ncoaches, labelled for the presence of humour; (ii) the Hume-Reaction dataset in\nwhich reactions of individuals to emotional stimuli have been annotated with\nrespect to seven emotional expression intensities, and (iii) the Ulm-Trier\nSocial Stress Test (Ulm-TSST) dataset comprising of audio-visual data labelled\nwith continuous emotion values (arousal and valence) of people in stressful\ndispositions. Using the introduced datasets, MuSe 2022 2022 addresses three\ncontemporary affective computing problems: in the Humor Detection Sub-Challenge\n(MuSe-Humor), spontaneous humour has to be recognised; in the Emotional\nReactions Sub-Challenge (MuSe-Reaction), seven fine-grained `in-the-wild'\nemotions have to be predicted; and in the Emotional Stress Sub-Challenge\n(MuSe-Stress), a continuous prediction of stressed emotion values is featured.\nThe challenge is designed to attract different research communities,\nencouraging a fusion of their disciplines. Mainly, MuSe 2022 targets the\ncommunities of audio-visual emotion recognition, health informatics, and\nsymbolic sentiment analysis. This baseline paper describes the datasets as well\nas the feature sets extracted from them. A recurrent neural network with LSTM\ncells is used to set competitive baseline results on the test partitions for\neach sub-challenge. We report an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of .8480 for\nMuSe-Humor; .2801 mean (from 7-classes) Pearson's Correlations Coefficient for\nMuSe-Reaction, as well as .4931 Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) and\n.4761 for valence and arousal in MuSe-Stress, respectively.",

Impressive progress in the domain of speech recognition has been\nexhibited by audio and audio-visual systems. Nevertheless, there is still much\nto be explored with regards to visual speech recognition systems due to the\nvisual ambiguity of some phonemes. To this end, the development of visual\nspeech recognition models is crucial given the instability of audio models. The\nmain contributions of this work are i) building on recent state-of-the-art\nword-based lipreading models by integrating sequence-level and frame-level\nKnowledge Distillation (KD) to their systems; ii) leveraging audio data during\ntraining visual models, a feat which has not been utilized in prior word-based\nwork; iii) proposing the Gaussian-shaped averaging in frame-level KD, as an\nefficient technique that aids the model in distilling knowledge at the sequence\nmodel encoder.

We\ncompare the detection error rate (DER), bit error rate (BER) and block error\nrate (BLER) performance of the proposed system with a hand-crafted\nstate-of-the-art conventional baseline and our simulations show a significant\nadvantage of the proposed autoencoder-based system over the conventional\nbaseline in every scenario up to messages conveying k = 96 information bits.\nFinally, we practically evaluate and confirm the improved performance of the\nproposed system over-the-air (OTA) using a software-defined radio (SDR)-based\nmeasurement testbed.",

Previous attempts typically tackle this\nproblem using pretrained object detectors, but without the flexibility for\nobjects not in the predefined vocabulary.

In this paper, we propose Dual Visual-Linguistic Interaction\n(DaVI), a novel unified end-to-end framework with the capability for both\nlinguistic answering and visual grounding. DaVI innovatively introduces two\nvisual-linguistic interaction mechanisms: 1) visual-based linguistic encoder\nthat understands questions incorporated with visual features and produces\nlinguistic-oriented evidence for further answer decoding, and 2)\nlinguistic-based visual decoder that focuses visual features on the\nevidence-related regions for answer grounding.

However, despite of using\nsophisticated rigidity assumptions and parametrizations, such networks are\ntypically limited to only two frame pairs which does not allow them to exploit\ntemporal information. In our paper we address this shortcoming by proposing a\nnovel multi-frame approach that considers an additional preceding stereo pair.\nTo this end, we proceed in two steps: Firstly, building upon the recent RAFT-3D\napproach, we develop an advanced two-frame baseline by incorporating an\nimproved stereo method. Secondly, and even more importantly, exploiting the\nspecific modeling concepts of RAFT-3D, we propose a U-Net like architecture\nthat performs a fusion of forward and backward flow estimates and hence allows\nto integrate temporal information on demand. Experiments on the KITTI benchmark\ndo not only show that the advantages of the improved baseline and the temporal\nfusion approach complement each other, they also demonstrate that the computed\nscene flow is highly accurate. More precisely, our approach ranks second\noverall and first for the even more challenging foreground objects, in total\noutperforming the original RAFT-3D method by more than 16%.

    "abstract": "Software fault-proneness prediction is an active research area, with many\nfactors affecting prediction performance extensively studied. However, the\nimpact of the learning approach (i.e., the specifics of the data used for\ntraining and the target variable being predicted) on the prediction performance\nhas not been studied, except for one initial work. This paper explores the\neffects of two learning approaches, useAllPredictAll and usePrePredictPost, on\nthe performance of software fault-proneness prediction, both within-release and\nacross-releases. The empirical results are based on data extracted from 64\nreleases of twelve open-source projects. Results show that the learning\napproach has a substantial, and typically unacknowledged, impact on the\nclassification performance. Specifically, using useAllPredictAll leads to\nsignificantly better performance than using usePrePredictPost learning\napproach, both within-release and across-releases. Furthermore, this paper\nuncovers that, for within-release predictions, this difference in\nclassification performance is due to different levels of class imbalance in the\ntwo learning approaches. When class imbalance is addressed, the performance\ndifference between the learning approaches is eliminated. Our findings imply\nthat the learning approach should always be explicitly identified and its\nimpact on software fault-proneness prediction considered.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks are known to be susceptible to adversarial perturbations\n-- small perturbations that alter the output of the network and exist under\nstrict norm limitations. While such perturbations are usually discussed as\ntailored to a specific input, a universal perturbation can be constructed to\nalter the model's output on a set of inputs. Universal perturbations present a\nmore realistic case of adversarial attacks, as awareness of the model's exact\ninput is not required. In addition, the universal attack setting raises the\nsubject of generalization to unseen data, where given a set of inputs, the\nuniversal perturbations aim to alter the model's output on out-of-sample data.\nIn this work, we study physical passive patch adversarial attacks on visual\nodometry-based autonomous navigation systems. A visual odometry system aims to\ninfer the relative camera motion between two corresponding viewpoints, and is\nfrequently used by vision-based autonomous navigation systems to estimate their\nstate. For such navigation systems, a patch adversarial perturbation poses a\nsevere security issue, as it can be used to mislead a system onto some\ncollision course. To the best of our knowledge, we show for the first time that\nthe error margin of a visual odometry model can be significantly increased by\ndeploying patch adversarial attacks in the scene. We provide evaluation on\nsynthetic closed-loop drone navigation data and demonstrate that a comparable\nvulnerability exists in real data.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a cube-based reconfigurable robot that utilizes an\nelectromagnet-based actuation framework to reconfigure in three dimensions via\npivoting. While a variety of actuation mechanisms for self-reconfigurable\nrobots have been explored, they often suffer from cost, complexity, assembly\nand sizing requirements that prevent scaled production of such robots. To\naddress this challenge, we use an actuation mechanism based on electromagnets\nembedded into the edges of each cube to interchangeably create identically or\noppositely polarized electromagnet pairs, resulting in repulsive or attractive\nforces, respectively. By leveraging attraction for hinge formation, and\nrepulsion to drive pivoting maneuvers, we can reconfigure the robot by\nvoxelizing it and actuating its constituent modules - termed Electrovoxels -\nvia electromagnetically actuated pivoting. To demonstrate this, we develop\nfully untethered, three-dimensional self-reconfigurable robots and demonstrate\n2D and 3D self-reconfiguration using pivot and traversal maneuvers on an\nair-table and in microgravity on a parabolic flight. This paper describes the\nhardware design of our robots, its pivoting framework, our reconfiguration\nplanning software, and an evaluation of the dynamical and electrical\ncharacteristics of our system to inform the design of scalable\nself-reconfigurable robots.",

    "abstract": "Detecting human-object interactions is essential for comprehensive\nunderstanding of visual scenes. In particular, spatial connections between\nhumans and objects are important cues for reasoning interactions. To this end,\nwe propose a skeleton-aware graph convolutional network for human-object\ninteraction detection, named SGCN4HOI. Our network exploits the spatial\nconnections between human keypoints and object keypoints to capture their\nfine-grained structural interactions via graph convolutions. It fuses such\ngeometric features with visual features and spatial configuration features\nobtained from human-object pairs. Furthermore, to better preserve the object\nstructural information and facilitate human-object interaction detection, we\npropose a novel skeleton-based object keypoints representation. The performance\nof SGCN4HOI is evaluated in the public benchmark V-COCO dataset. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art\npose-based models and achieves competitive performance against other models.",

    "abstract": "Although neural radiance fields (NeRF) have shown impressive advances for\nnovel view synthesis, most methods typically require multiple input images of\nthe same scene with accurate camera poses. In this work, we seek to\nsubstantially reduce the inputs to a single unposed image. Existing approaches\ncondition on local image features to reconstruct a 3D object, but often render\nblurry predictions at viewpoints that are far away from the source view. To\naddress this issue, we propose to leverage both the global and local features\nto form an expressive 3D representation. The global features are learned from a\nvision transformer, while the local features are extracted from a 2D\nconvolutional network. To synthesize a novel view, we train a multilayer\nperceptron (MLP) network conditioned on the learned 3D representation to\nperform volume rendering. This novel 3D representation allows the network to\nreconstruct unseen regions without enforcing constraints like symmetry or\ncanonical coordinate systems. Our method can render novel views from only a\nsingle input image and generalize across multiple object categories using a\nsingle model. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that the\nproposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance and renders richer\ndetails than existing approaches.",

    "abstract": "NLP systems typically require support for more than one language. As\ndifferent languages have different amounts of supervision, cross-lingual\ntransfer benefits languages with little to no training data by transferring\nfrom other languages. From an engineering perspective, multilingual NLP\nbenefits development and maintenance by serving multiple languages with a\nsingle system. Both cross-lingual transfer and multilingual NLP rely on\ncross-lingual representations serving as the foundation. As BERT revolutionized\nrepresentation learning and NLP, it also revolutionized cross-lingual\nrepresentations and cross-lingual transfer. Multilingual BERT was released as a\nreplacement for single-language BERT, trained with Wikipedia data in 104\nlanguages.\nSurprisingly, without any explicit cross-lingual signal, multilingual BERT\nlearns cross-lingual representations in addition to representations for\nindividual languages. This thesis first shows such surprising cross-lingual\neffectiveness compared against prior art on various tasks. Naturally, it raises\na set of questions, most notably how do these multilingual encoders learn\ncross-lingual representations. In exploring these questions, this thesis will\nanalyze the behavior of multilingual models in a variety of settings on high\nand low resource languages. We also look at how to inject different\ncross-lingual signals into multilingual encoders, and the optimization behavior\nof cross-lingual transfer with these models. Together, they provide a better\nunderstanding of multilingual encoders on cross-lingual transfer. Our findings\nwill lead us to suggested improvements to multilingual encoders and\ncross-lingual transfer.",

We focus on the Predictive State Representations\n(PSRs) model, which is an expressive model that captures other well-known\nmodels such as Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP). PSR\nrepresents the states using a set of predictions of future observations and is\ndefined entirely using observable quantities. We develop a novel model-based\nalgorithm for PSRs that can learn a near optimal policy in sample complexity\nscaling polynomially with respect to all the relevant parameters of the\nsystems. Our algorithm naturally works with function approximation to extend to\nsystems with potentially large state and observation spaces. We show that given\na realizable model class, the sample complexity of learning the near optimal\npolicy only scales polynomially with respect to the statistical complexity of\nthe model class, without any explicit polynomial dependence on the size of the\nstate and observation spaces. Notably, our work is the first work that shows\npolynomial sample complexities to compete with the globally optimal policy in\nPSRs. Finally, we demonstrate how our general theorem can be directly used to\nderive sample complexity bounds for special models including $m$-step weakly\nrevealing and $m$-step decodable tabular POMDPs, POMDPs with low-rank latent\ntransition, and POMDPs with linear emission and latent transition.",

    "abstract": "In lifelong learning, an agent learns throughout its entire life without\nresets, in a constantly changing environment, as we humans do. Consequently,\nlifelong learning comes with a plethora of research problems such as continual\ndomain shifts, which result in non-stationary rewards and environment dynamics.\nThese non-stationarities are difficult to detect and cope with due to their\ncontinuous nature. Therefore, exploration strategies and learning methods are\nrequired that are capable of tracking the steady domain shifts, and adapting to\nthem. We propose Reactive Exploration to track and react to continual domain\nshifts in lifelong reinforcement learning, and to update the policy\ncorrespondingly. To this end, we conduct experiments in order to investigate\ndifferent exploration strategies. We empirically show that representatives of\nthe policy-gradient family are better suited for lifelong learning, as they\nadapt more quickly to distribution shifts than Q-learning. Thereby,\npolicy-gradient methods profit the most from Reactive Exploration and show good\nresults in lifelong learning with continual domain shifts.

The\nnecessary and sufficient condition includes the circle criterion for each\nplayer and a rank condition related to the transfer function of each player.\nThe condition provides an analytical method to check the existence of such cost\nparameters, while previous studies need to solve a convex feasibility problem\nnumerically to answer the same question. We develop an identity in\nfrequency-domain representation to characterize the cost parameters, which we\nrefer to as the Kalman equation. The Kalman equation reduces redundancy in the\ntime-domain analysis that involves solving a convex feasibility problem.

Thus, a generic beamforming optimization\nprocess is interpreted as a computation task over a weight bipartite graph.\nThis approach partitions the beamforming optimization procedure into multiple\nsuboperations dedicated to individual antenna vertices and user vertices.\nSeparated vertex operations lead to scalable beamforming calculations that are\ninvariant to the system size. The vertex operations are realized by a group of\nDNN modules that collectively form the BGNN architecture. Identical DNNs are\nreused at all antennas and users so that the resultant learning structure\nbecomes flexible to the network size. Component DNNs of the BGNN are trained\njointly over numerous MU-MISO configurations with randomly varying network\nsizes. As a result, the trained BGNN can be universally applied to arbitrary\nMU-MISO systems. Numerical results validate the advantages of the BGNN\nframework over conventional methods.",

    "abstract": "Wound image segmentation is a critical component for the clinical diagnosis\nand in-time treatment of wounds. Recently, deep learning has become the\nmainstream methodology for wound image segmentation. However, the\npre-processing of the wound image, such as the illumination correction, is\nrequired before the training phase as the performance can be greatly improved.\nThe correction procedure and the training of deep models are independent of\neach other, which leads to sub-optimal segmentation performance as the fixed\nillumination correction may not be suitable for all images. To address\naforementioned issues, an end-to-end dual-view segmentation approach was\nproposed in this paper, by incorporating a learn-able illumination correction\nmodule into the deep segmentation models. The parameters of the module can be\nlearned and updated during the training stage automatically, while the\ndual-view fusion can fully employ the features from both the raw images and the\nenhanced ones. To demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed\nframework, the extensive experiments are conducted on the benchmark datasets.\nThe encouraging results suggest that our framework can significantly improve\nthe segmentation performance, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "We study the inverse medium scattering problem to reconstruct the unknown\ninhomogeneous medium from the far-field patterns of scattered waves. The\ninverse scattering problem is generally ill-posed and nonlinear, and the\niterative optimization method is often adapted. A natural iterative approach to\nthis problem is to place all available measurements and mappings into one long\nvector and mapping, respectively, and to iteratively solve the linearized large\nsystem equation using the Tikhonov regularization method, which is called the\nLevenberg-Marquardt scheme. However, this is computationally expensive because\nwe must construct the larger system equations when the number of available\nmeasurements increases. In this paper, we propose two reconstruction algorithms\nbased on the Kalman filter. One is the algorithm equivalent to the\nLevenberg-Marquardt scheme, and the other is inspired by the Extended Kalman\nFilter. For the algorithm derivation, we iteratively apply the Kalman filter to\nthe linearized equation for our nonlinear equation. Our proposed algorithms\nsequentially update the state and the weight of the norm for the state space,\nwhich avoids the construction of a large system equation and retains the\ninformation of past updates.

    "abstract": "Learning against label noise is a vital topic to guarantee a reliable\nperformance for deep neural networks. Recent research usually refers to dynamic\nnoise modeling with model output probabilities and loss values, and then\nseparates clean and noisy samples. These methods have gained notable success.\nHowever, unlike cherry-picked data, existing approaches often cannot perform\nwell when facing imbalanced datasets, a common scenario in the real world. We\nthoroughly investigate this phenomenon and point out two major issues that\nhinder the performance, i.e., \\emph{inter-class loss distribution discrepancy}\nand \\emph{misleading predictions due to uncertainty}. The first issue is that\nexisting methods often perform class-agnostic noise modeling. However, loss\ndistributions show a significant discrepancy among classes under class\nimbalance, and class-agnostic noise modeling can easily get confused with noisy\nsamples and samples in minority classes. The second issue refers to that models\nmay output misleading predictions due to epistemic uncertainty and aleatoric\nuncertainty, thus existing methods that rely solely on the output probabilities\nmay fail to distinguish confident samples. Inspired by our observations, we\npropose an Uncertainty-aware Label Correction framework~(ULC) to handle label\nnoise on imbalanced datasets. First, we perform epistemic uncertainty-aware\nclass-specific noise modeling to identify trustworthy clean samples and\nrefine/discard highly confident true/corrupted labels. Then, we introduce\naleatoric uncertainty in the subsequent learning process to prevent noise\naccumulation in the label noise modeling process. We conduct experiments on\nseveral synthetic and real-world datasets. The results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method, especially on imbalanced datasets.",

Understanding the limits of quantum networks requires an\nunderstanding of both the ultimate capacities of quantum channels and the\nefficiency of imperfect quantum repeaters. In this work, using a recently\ndeveloped node-splitting technique which introduces internal losses and noise\ninto repeater devices, we present achievable end-to-end rates for\nnoisy-repeater quantum networks. These are obtained by extending the coherent\nand reverse coherent information (single channel capacity lower bounds) into\nend-to-end capacity lower bounds, both in the context of single-path and\nmulti-path routing. These achievable rates are completely general, and apply to\nnetworks composed of arbitrary channels arranged in general topologies. Through\nthis general formalism, we show how tight upper-bounds can also be derived by\nsupplementing appropriate single-edge capacity bounds. As a result, we develop\ntools which provide tight performance bounds for quantum networks constituent\nof channels whose capacities are not exactly known, and reveal critical network\nproperties which are necessary for high-rate quantum communications.

This allows for computing the Sprague-Grundy value of the\ngiven game in $O(\\log(n))$ time units, where time unit allows for reading an\ninteger, or performing a basic arithmetic operation. This improves on the\nprevious bound of $O(n)$ time units, due to by Ili\\'c (2019), which can be\nobtained by an improvement of the Sprague-Grundy recursion.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) enabled\nnon-line-of-sight (NLoS) wireless sensing, in which an IRS is dedicatedly\ndeployed to assist an access point (AP) to sense a target at its NLoS region.\nIt is assumed that the AP is equipped with multiple antennas and the IRS is\nequipped with a uniform linear array. We consider two types of target models,\nnamely the point and extended targets, for which the AP aims to estimate the\ntarget's direction-of-arrival (DoA) and the target response matrix with respect\nto the IRS, respectively, based on the echo signals from the\nAP-IRS-target-IRS-AP link. Under this setup, we jointly design the transmit\nbeamforming at the AP and the reflective beamforming at the IRS to minimize the\nCram\\'er-Rao bound (CRB) on the estimation error. Towards this end, we first\nobtain the CRB expressions for the two target models in closed form. It is\nshown that in the point target case, the CRB for estimating the DoA depends on\nboth the transmit and reflective beamformers; while in the extended target\ncase, the CRB for estimating the target response matrix only depends on the\ntransmit beamformers. Next, for the point target case, we optimize the joint\nbeamforming design to minimize the CRB, via alternating optimization,\nsemi-definite relaxation, and successive convex approximation. For the extended\ntarget case, we obtain the optimal transmit beamforming solution to minimize\nthe CRB in closed form. Finally, numerical results show that for both cases,\nthe proposed designs based on CRB minimization achieve improved sensing\nperformance in terms of mean squared error, as compared to other traditional\nschemes.",

    "title": "A Single-Loop Gradient Descent and Perturbed Ascent Algorithm for  Nonconvex Functional Constrained Optimization",
    "abstract": "Nonconvex constrained optimization problems can be used to model a number of\nmachine learning problems, such as multi-class Neyman-Pearson classification\nand constrained Markov decision processes. However, such kinds of problems are\nchallenging because both the objective and constraints are possibly nonconvex,\nso it is difficult to balance the reduction of the loss value and reduction of\nconstraint violation. Although there are a few methods that solve this class of\nproblems, all of them are double-loop or triple-loop algorithms, and they\nrequire oracles to solve some subproblems up to certain accuracy by tuning\nmultiple hyperparameters at each iteration. In this paper, we propose a novel\ngradient descent and perturbed ascent (GDPA) algorithm to solve a class of\nsmooth nonconvex inequality constrained problems. The GDPA is a primal-dual\nalgorithm, which only exploits the first-order information of both the\nobjective and constraint functions to update the primal and dual variables in\nan alternating way. The key feature of the proposed algorithm is that it is a\nsingle-loop algorithm, where only two step-sizes need to be tuned. We show that\nunder a mild regularity condition GDPA is able to find Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)\npoints of nonconvex functional constrained problems with convergence rate\nguarantees. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first single-loop algorithm\nthat can solve the general nonconvex smooth problems with nonconvex inequality\nconstraints. Numerical results also showcase the superiority of GDPA compared\nwith the best-known algorithms (in terms of both stationarity measure and\nfeasibility of the obtained solutions).",

    "abstract": "Stochastic simulators are non-deterministic computer models which provide a\ndifferent response each time they are run, even when the input parameters are\nheld at fixed values. They arise when additional sources of uncertainty are\naffecting the computer model, which are not explicitly modeled as input\nparameters. The uncertainty analysis of stochastic simulators requires their\nrepeated evaluation for different values of the input variables, as well as for\ndifferent realizations of the underlying latent stochasticity. The\ncomputational cost of such analyses can be considerable, which motivates the\nconstruction of surrogate models that can approximate the original model and\nits stochastic response, but can be evaluated at much lower cost.\nWe propose a surrogate model for stochastic simulators based on spectral\nexpansions. Considering a certain class of stochastic simulators that can be\nrepeatedly evaluated for the same underlying random event, we view the\nsimulator as a random field indexed by the input parameter space. For a fixed\nrealization of the latent stochasticity, the response of the simulator is a\ndeterministic function, called trajectory. Based on samples from several such\ntrajectories, we approximate the latter by sparse polynomial chaos expansion\nand compute analytically an extended Karhunen-Lo\\`eve expansion (KLE) to reduce\nits dimensionality. The uncorrelated but dependent random variables of the KLE\nare modeled by advanced statistical techniques such as parametric inference,\nvine copula modeling, and kernel density estimation. The resulting surrogate\nmodel approximates the marginals and the covariance function, and allows to\nobtain new realizations at low computational cost. We observe that in our\nnumerical examples, the first mode of the KLE is by far the most important, and\ninvestigate this phenomenon and its implications.",

The finite-element\n(FE) models of human mandibles from three patients are used to investigate the\nposition of the CRots for different patients' teeth in 3D space. The CRot is\nconsidered a single point in a 3D coordinate system and is obtained by choosing\nthe closest point on the axis of rotation to the center of resistance (CRes). A\nforce system, consisting of a constant load and a couple (pair of forces), is\napplied to each tooth, and the corresponding CRot trajectories are examined\nacross different patients. To perform a consistent inter-patient analysis,\ndifferent patients' teeth are registered to the corresponding reference teeth\nusing an affine transformation. The selected directions and applied points of\nforce on the reference teeth are then transformed into the registered teeth\ndomains. The effect of the direction of the couple on the location of the CRot\nis also studied by rotating the couples about the three principal axes of a\npatient's premolar. Our results indicate that similar patterns can be obtained\nfor the CRot positions of different patients and teeth if the same load\nconditions are used. Moreover, equally rotating the direction of the couple\nabout the three principal axes results in different patterns for the CRot\npositions, especially in labiolingual direction. The CRot trajectories follow\nsimilar patterns in the corresponding teeth, but any changes in the direction\nof the force and couple cause misalignment of the CRot trajectories, seen as\nrotations about the long axis of the tooth.",
