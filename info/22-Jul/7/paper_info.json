    "title": "Transfer Learning for Rapid Extraction of Thickness from Optical Spectra  of Semiconductor Thin Films",
    "abstract": "High-throughput experimentation with autonomous workflows, increasingly used\nto screen and optimize optoelectronic thin films, requires matching throughput\nof downstream characterizations. Despite being essential, thickness\ncharacterization lags in throughput. Although optical spectroscopic methods,\ne.g., spectrophotometry, provide quick measurements, a critical bottleneck is\nthe ensuing manual fitting of optical oscillation models to the measured\nreflection and transmission. This study presents a machine-learning (ML)\nframework called thicknessML, which rapidly extracts film thickness from\nspectroscopic reflection and transmission. thicknessML leverages transfer\nlearning to generalize to materials of different underlying optical oscillator\nmodels (i.e., different material classes).We demonstrate that thicknessML can\nextract film thickness from six perovskite samples in a two-stage process: (1)\npre-training on a generic simulated dataset of Tauc-Lorentz oscillator, and (2)\ntransfer learning to a simulated perovskite dataset of several literature\nperovskite refractive indices. Results show a pre-training thickness mean\nabsolute percentage error (MAPE) of 5-7% and an experimental thickness MAPE of\n6-19%.",

    "abstract": "The regulatory approval and broad clinical deployment of medical AI have been\nhampered by the perception that deep learning models fail in unpredictable and\npossibly catastrophic ways. A lack of statistically rigorous uncertainty\nquantification is a significant factor undermining trust in AI results. Recent\ndevelopments in distribution-free uncertainty quantification present practical\nsolutions for these issues by providing reliability guarantees for black-box\nmodels on arbitrary data distributions as formally valid finite-sample\nprediction intervals. Our work applies these new uncertainty quantification\nmethods -- specifically conformal prediction -- to a deep-learning model for\ngrading the severity of spinal stenosis in lumbar spine MRI. We demonstrate a\ntechnique for forming ordinal prediction sets that are guaranteed to contain\nthe correct stenosis severity within a user-defined probability (confidence\ninterval). On a dataset of 409 MRI exams processed by the deep-learning model,\nthe conformal method provides tight coverage with small prediction set sizes.\nFurthermore, we explore the potential clinical applicability of flagging cases\nwith high uncertainty predictions (large prediction sets) by quantifying an\nincrease in the prevalence of significant imaging abnormalities (e.g. motion\nartifacts, metallic artifacts, and tumors) that could degrade confidence in\npredictive performance when compared to a random sample of cases.",

    "abstract": "Mastering the technical skills required to perform surgery is an extremely\nchallenging task. Video-based assessment allows surgeons to receive feedback on\ntheir technical skills to facilitate learning and development. Currently, this\nfeedback comes primarily from manual video review, which is time-intensive and\nlimits the feasibility of tracking a surgeon's progress over many cases. In\nthis work, we introduce a motion-based approach to automatically assess\nsurgical skills from surgical case video feed. The proposed pipeline first\ntracks surgical tools reliably to create motion trajectories and then uses\nthose trajectories to predict surgeon technical skill levels. The tracking\nalgorithm employs a simple yet effective re-identification module that improves\nID-switch compared to other state-of-the-art methods. This is critical for\ncreating reliable tool trajectories when instruments regularly move on- and\noff-screen or are periodically obscured. The motion-based classification model\nemploys a state-of-the-art self-attention transformer network to capture short-\nand long-term motion patterns that are essential for skill evaluation. The\nproposed method is evaluated on an in-vivo (Cholec80) dataset where an\nexpert-rated GOALS skill assessment of the Calot Triangle Dissection is used as\na quantitative skill measure. We compare transformer-based skill assessment\nwith traditional machine learning approaches using the proposed and\nstate-of-the-art tracking. Our result suggests that using motion trajectories\nfrom reliable tracking methods is beneficial for assessing surgeon skills based\nsolely on video streams.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Strength-based Argumentation Frameworks (StrAFs) have been proposed\nto model situations where some quantitative strength is associated with\narguments. In this setting, the notion of accrual corresponds to sets of\narguments that collectively attack an argument. Some semantics have already\nbeen defined, which are sensitive to the existence of accruals that\ncollectively defeat their target, while their individual elements cannot.\nHowever, until now, only the surface of this framework and semantics have been\nstudied. Indeed, the existing literature focuses on the adaptation of the\nstable semantics to StrAFs. In this paper, we push forward the study and\ninvestigate the adaptation of admissibility-based semantics. Especially, we\nshow that the strong admissibility defined in the literature does not satisfy a\ndesirable property, namely Dung's fundamental lemma. We therefore propose an\nalternative definition that induces semantics that behave as expected. We then\nstudy computational issues for these new semantics, in particular we show that\ncomplexity of reasoning is similar to the complexity of the corresponding\ndecision problems for standard argumentation frameworks in almost all cases. We\nthen propose a translation in pseudo-Boolean constraints for computing (strong\nand weak) extensions. We conclude with an experimental evaluation of our\napproach which shows in particular that it scales up well for solving the\nproblem of providing one extension as well as enumerating them all.",

While this new generation of codecs is capable of synthesizing\nhigh-fidelity speech, their use of recurrent or convolutional layers often\nrestricts their effective receptive fields, which prevents them from\ncompressing speech efficiently. We propose to further reduce the bitrate of\nneural speech codecs through the use of pretrained Transformers, capable of\nexploiting long-range dependencies in the input signal due to their inductive\nbias. As such, we use a pretrained Transformer in tandem with a convolutional\nencoder, which is trained end-to-end with a quantizer and a generative\nadversarial net decoder. Our numerical experiments show that supplementing the\nconvolutional encoder of a neural speech codec with Transformer speech\nembeddings yields a speech codec with a bitrate of $600\\,\\mathrm{bps}$ that\noutperforms the original neural speech codec in synthesized speech quality when\ntrained at the same bitrate.

    "abstract": "Lexical semantics and cognitive science point to affordances (i.e. the\nactions that objects support) as critical for understanding and representing\nnouns and verbs. However, study of these semantic features has not yet been\nintegrated with the \"foundation\" models that currently dominate language\nrepresentation research. We hypothesize that predictive modeling of object\nstate over time will result in representations that encode object affordance\ninformation \"for free\". We train a neural network to predict objects'\ntrajectories in a simulated interaction and show that our network's latent\nrepresentations differentiate between both observed and unobserved affordances.\nWe find that models trained using 3D simulations from our SPATIAL dataset\noutperform conventional 2D computer vision models trained on a similar task,\nand, on initial inspection, that differences between concepts correspond to\nexpected features (e.g., roll entails rotation). Our results suggest a way in\nwhich modern deep learning approaches to grounded language learning can be\nintegrated with traditional formal semantic notions of lexical representations.",

    "title": "STOCHOS: Stochastic Opportunistic Maintenance Scheduling For Offshore  Wind Farms",
    "abstract": "Despite the promising outlook, the numerous economic and environmental\nbenefits of offshore wind energy are still compromised by its high operations\nand maintenance (O&M) expenditures. On one hand, offshore-specific challenges\nsuch as site remoteness, harsh weather, high transportation requirements, and\nproduction losses, significantly inflate the total O&M expenses relative to\nland-based wind farms. On the other hand, the uncertainties in weather\nconditions, asset degradation, and electricity prices largely constrain the\nfarm operator's ability to determine the time windows at which maintenance is\npossible, let alone optimal. In response, we propose STOCHOS, short for the\nstochastic holistic opportunistic scheduler--a maintenance scheduling approach\ntailored to address the unique challenges and uncertainties in offshore wind\nfarms. Given probabilistic forecasts of key environmental and operational\nparameters, STOCHOS optimally schedules the offshore maintenance tasks by\nharnessing the maintenance opportunities that arise due to a combination of\nfavorable weather conditions, on-site maintenance resources, and maximal\noperating revenues. STOCHOS is formulated as a two-stage stochastic mixed\ninteger linear program, which we solve using a scenario-based rolling horizon\nalgorithm that aligns with the industrial practice. Scenarios are generated\nusing a probabilistic forecasting framework which adequately characterizes the\ntemporal dependence in key input parameters. Evaluated on a real-world case\nstudy from the U.S. North Atlantic where several large-scale offshore wind\nfarms are being developed, STOCHOS achieves considerable improvements relative\nto prevalent maintenance benchmarks, across several O&M metrics, including\ntotal cost, downtime, resource utilization, and maintenance interruptions,\nattesting to its potential merit towards enabling the economic viability of\noffshore wind energy.",

    "abstract": "The emerging beyond 5G and envisioned 6G wireless networks are considered as\nkey enablers in supporting a diversified set of applications for industrial\nmobile robots (MRs). The scenario under investigation in this paper relates to\nmobile robots that autonomously roam in an industrial floor and perform a\nvariety of tasks at different locations whilst utilizing high directivity\nbeamformers in mmWave small cells. In such scenarios, the potential close\nproximity of mobile robots connected to different base stations, may cause\nexcessive levels of interference having as a net result a decrease in the\noverall achievable data rate in the network. To resolve this issue, a novel\nmixed integer linear programming formulation is proposed where the trajectory\nof the mobile robots is considered jointly with the interference level at\ndifferent beam sectors. Therefore, creating a low interference path for each\nmobile robot in the industrial floor. A wide set of numerical investigations\nreveal that the proposed path planning optimization approach for the mmWave\nconnected mobile robots can improve the overall achievable throughput by up to\n31% compared to an interference oblivious scheme, without penalizing the\noverall travelling time.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised distribution alignment estimates a transformation that maps two\nor more source distributions to a shared aligned distribution given only\nsamples from each distribution. This task has many applications including\ngenerative modeling, unsupervised domain adaptation, and socially aware\nlearning. Most prior works use adversarial learning (i.e., min-max\noptimization), which can be challenging to optimize and evaluate. A few recent\nworks explore non-adversarial flow-based (i.e., invertible) approaches, but\nthey lack a unified perspective and are limited in efficiently aligning\nmultiple distributions. Therefore, we propose to unify and generalize previous\nflow-based approaches under a single non-adversarial framework, which we prove\nis equivalent to minimizing an upper bound on the Jensen-Shannon Divergence\n(JSD).

In this work, we present a Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) based CC solution that learns from certain traffic scenarios and\nsuccessfully generalizes to others.

A critical impediment towards\ncreating and evaluating methods to mitigate this issue is the lack of any\npublicly-available data on malicious paper bidding.

    "title": "Can We Effectively Use Smart Contracts to Stipulate Time Constraints?",
    "abstract": "Smart contracts provide the means to stipulate rules of interaction between\nmutually distrustful organizations. They encode contractual agreements on the\nbasis of source code, which else need to be contractualized in natural\nlanguage. While the mediation of contractual agreements via smart contracts is\nseamless in theory, it requires that the conditions of an interaction are\naccurately made available in the blockchain. Time is a prominent such\ncondition. In the paper at hand, we empirically measure the consistency of a\nsmart contract to yield equal results on the basis of the time of an\ninteraction and its potentially inaccurate representation in the blockchain. We\npropose a novel metric called execution accuracy to measure this consistency.\nWe specifically measure the execution accuracy of a time interval-constrained\nsmart contract that executes distinct logic within and without some constraint\ninterval. We run experiments for the local Ganache and Quorum and the public\nG\\\"orli and Rinkeby Ethereum blockchains. Our experiments confirm our intuition\nthat execution accuracy decreases near interval bounds. The novelty of our\nproposed metric resides in its capacity to quantify this decrease and make\ndistinct blockchains comparable with respect to their capacity to accurately\nstipulate time contraints.",

    "abstract": "Transformers for visual-language representation learning have been getting a\nlot of interest and shown tremendous performance on visual question answering\n(VQA) and grounding. But most systems that show good performance of those tasks\nstill rely on pre-trained object detectors during training, which limits their\napplicability to the object classes available for those detectors. To mitigate\nthis limitation, the following paper focuses on the problem of weakly\nsupervised grounding in context of visual question answering in transformers.\nThe approach leverages capsules by grouping each visual token in the visual\nencoder and uses activations from language self-attention layers as a\ntext-guided selection module to mask those capsules before they are forwarded\nto the next layer. We evaluate our approach on the challenging GQA as well as\nVQA-HAT dataset for VQA grounding. Our experiments show that: while removing\nthe information of masked objects from standard transformer architectures leads\nto a significant drop in performance, the integration of capsules significantly\nimproves the grounding ability of such systems and provides new\nstate-of-the-art results compared to other approaches in the field.",

While\nprevious research in PINNs has mainly focused on constructing and balancing\nloss functions during training to avoid poor minima, the effect of sampling\ncollocation points on the performance of PINNs has largely been overlooked. In\nthis work, we find that the performance of PINNs can vary significantly with\ndifferent sampling strategies, and using a fixed set of collocation points can\nbe quite detrimental to the convergence of PINNs to the correct solution. In\nparticular, (1) we hypothesize that training of PINNs rely on successful\n\"propagation\" of solution from initial and/or boundary condition points to\ninterior points, and PINNs with poor sampling strategies can get stuck at\ntrivial solutions if there are \\textit{propagation failures}. (2) We\ndemonstrate that propagation failures are characterized by highly imbalanced\nPDE residual fields where very high residuals are observed over very narrow\nregions. (3) To mitigate propagation failure, we propose a novel\n\\textit{evolutionary sampling} (Evo) method that can incrementally accumulate\ncollocation points in regions of high PDE residuals. We further provide an\nextension of Evo to respect the principle of causality while solving\ntime-dependent PDEs.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and their\nhyperbolic variants provide a promising approach to encode such networks in a\nlow-dimensional latent space through neighborhood aggregation and hierarchical\nfeature extraction, respectively. However, these approaches typically ignore\nmetapath structures and the available semantic information. Furthermore, these\napproaches are sensitive to the noise present in the training data. To tackle\nthese limitations, in this paper, we propose Text Enriched Sparse Hyperbolic\nGraph Convolution Network (TESH-GCN) to capture the graph's metapath structures\nusing semantic signals and further improve prediction in large heterogeneous\ngraphs. In TESH-GCN, we extract semantic node information, which successively\nacts as a connection signal to extract relevant nodes' local neighborhood and\ngraph-level metapath features from the sparse adjacency tensor in a\nreformulated hyperbolic graph convolution layer. These extracted features in\nconjunction with semantic features from the language model (for robustness) are\nused for the final downstream task. Experiments on various heterogeneous graph\ndatasets show that our model outperforms the current state-of-the-art\napproaches by a large margin on the task of link prediction.

Thus, in this\npaper, we explore the feasibility of adapting RGB-based unsupervised\nrepresentation learning to RF signals. We show that while contrastive learning\nhas emerged as the main technique for unsupervised representation learning from\nimages and videos, such methods produce poor performance when applied to\nsensing humans using RF signals. In contrast, predictive unsupervised learning\nmethods learn high-quality representations that can be used for multiple\ndownstream RF-based sensing tasks. Our empirical results show that this\napproach outperforms state-of-the-art RF-based human sensing on various tasks,\nopening the possibility of unsupervised representation learning from this novel\nmodality.",

    "abstract": "Video semantic segmentation has achieved great progress under the supervision\nof large amounts of labelled training data. However, domain adaptive video\nsegmentation, which can mitigate data labelling constraints by adapting from a\nlabelled source domain toward an unlabelled target domain, is largely\nneglected. We design temporal pseudo supervision (TPS), a simple and effective\nmethod that explores the idea of consistency training for learning effective\nrepresentations from unlabelled target videos. Unlike traditional consistency\ntraining that builds consistency in spatial space, we explore consistency\ntraining in spatiotemporal space by enforcing model consistency across\naugmented video frames which helps learn from more diverse target data.\nSpecifically, we design cross-frame pseudo labelling to provide pseudo\nsupervision from previous video frames while learning from the augmented\ncurrent video frames. The cross-frame pseudo labelling encourages the network\nto produce high-certainty predictions, which facilitates consistency training\nwith cross-frame augmentation effectively. Extensive experiments over multiple\npublic datasets show that TPS is simpler to implement, much more stable to\ntrain, and achieves superior video segmentation accuracy as compared with the\nstate-of-the-art.",

The income of the traditional film\nindustry depends on the box office and also includes movie merchandising,\nadvertisement, home entertainment, book sales etc. Movie merchandising can even\nbecome more profitable than the box office. Therefore, market analysis and\nforecasting methods for multi-feature merchandising of multi-type films are\nparticularly important. Traditional market research is time-consuming and\nlabour-intensive, and its practical value is restricted. Due to the limited\nresearch method, more effective predictive analysis technology needs to be\nformed. With the rapid development of machine learning and big data, a large\nnumber of machine learning algorithms for predictive regression and\nclassification recognition have been proposed and widely used in product design\nand industry analysis. This paper proposes a high-precision movie merchandising\nprediction model based on machine learning technology: WE model. This model\nintegrates three machine learning algorithms to accurately predict the movie\nmerchandising market. The WE model learns the relationship between the movie\nmerchandising market and movie features by analyzing the main feature\ninformation of movies. After testing, the accuracy rate of prediction and\nevaluation in the merchandising market reaches 72.5%, and it has achieved a\nstrong market control effect.",

Text sentiment analysis can be divided into text-level sentiment\nanalysis, sen-tence-level sentiment analysis and aspect-level sentiment\nanalysis. Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained task in the\nfield of sentiment analysis, which aims to predict the polarity of aspects. The\nresearch of pre-training neural model has significantly improved the\nperformance of many natural language processing tasks. In recent years, pre\ntraining model (PTM) has been applied in ABSA.

In this paper, we explored the recent DeBERTa model (Decoding-enhanced\nBERT with disentangled attention) to solve Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis\nproblem. DeBERTa is a kind of neural language model based on transformer, which\nuses self-supervised learning to pre-train on a large number of original text\ncorpora.

Given limited style exemplars ($\\sim$100), the\nnew architecture can produce high-quality style transfer results with advanced\nability to synthesize high-fidelity contents and strong generality to handle\ncomplicated scenes (e.g., occlusions and accessories). Moreover, it enables\nfull-body image translation via one elegant evaluation network trained by\npartial observations (i.e., stylized heads).

This paper aims to handle the challenge by adopting the key idea of\n\"calibration first, translation later\" and exploring the augmented global\nstructure with locally-focused translation. Specifically, the proposed DCT-Net\nconsists of three modules: a content adapter borrowing the powerful prior from\nsource photos to calibrate the content distribution of target samples; a\ngeometry expansion module using affine transformations to release spatially\nsemantic constraints; and a texture translation module leveraging samples\nproduced by the calibrated distribution to learn a fine-grained conversion.\nExperimental results demonstrate the proposed method's superiority over the\nstate of the art in head stylization and its effectiveness on full image\ntranslation with adaptive deformations.",

    "abstract": "Recently, horizontal representation-based panoramic semantic segmentation\napproaches outperform projection-based solutions, because the distortions can\nbe effectively removed by compressing the spherical data in the vertical\ndirection. However, these methods ignore the distortion distribution prior and\nare limited to unbalanced receptive fields, e.g., the receptive fields are\nsufficient in the vertical direction and insufficient in the horizontal\ndirection. Differently, a vertical representation compressed in another\ndirection can offer implicit distortion prior and enlarge horizontal receptive\nfields. In this paper, we combine the two different representations and propose\na novel 360{\\deg} semantic segmentation solution from a complementary\nperspective. Our network comprises three modules: a feature extraction module,\na bi-directional compression module, and an ensemble decoding module. First, we\nextract multi-scale features from a panorama. Then, a bi-directional\ncompression module is designed to compress features into two complementary\nlow-dimensional representations, which provide content perception and\ndistortion prior. Furthermore, to facilitate the fusion of bi-directional\nfeatures, we design a unique self distillation strategy in the ensemble\ndecoding module to enhance the interaction of different features and further\nimprove the performance.

However, clinical decision support (CDS) technologies based on ML\nneed to be portable if they are to be adopted on a broad scale. In this\nrespect, models developed at one institution should be reusable at another. Yet\nthere are numerous examples of portability failure, particularly due to naive\napplication of ML models. Portability failure can lead to suboptimal care and\nmedical errors, which ultimately could prevent the adoption of ML-based CDS in\npractice. One specific healthcare challenge that could benefit from enhanced\nportability is the prediction of 30-day readmission risk. Research to date has\nshown that deep learning models can be effective at modeling such risk. In this\nwork, we investigate the practicality of model portability through a cross-site\nevaluation of readmission prediction models. To do so, we apply a recurrent\nneural network, augmented with self-attention and blended with expert features,\nto build readmission prediction models for two independent large scale claims\ndatasets. We further present a novel transfer learning technique that adapts\nthe well-known method of born-again network (BAN) training. Our experiments\nshow that direct application of ML models trained at one institution and tested\nat another institution perform worse than models trained and tested at the same\ninstitution. We further show that the transfer learning approach based on the\nBAN produces models that are better than those trained on just a single\ninstitution's data. Notably, this improvement is consistent across both sites\nand occurs after a single retraining, which illustrates the potential for a\ncheap and general model transfer mechanism of readmission risk prediction.",

To fill this gap, we propose NONparametric\nFActor Trajectory learning for dynamic tensor decomposition (NONFAT). We place\nGaussian process (GP) priors in the frequency domain and conduct inverse\nFourier transform via Gauss-Laguerre quadrature to sample the trajectory\nfunctions. In this way, we can overcome data sparsity and obtain robust\ntrajectory estimates across long time horizons.

We\nconsidered two decomposition methods: simple SVD regarding the evaluation\nfunction as a matrix and the Tucker decomposition by higher-order SVD (HOSVD).\nAt the same compression ratio, the strategy with the approximated evaluation\nfunction obtained by HOSVD exhibited a significantly higher winning rate than\nthat obtained by SVD. These results suggest that SVD can effectively compress\nboard game strategies and an optimal compression method that depends on the\ngame exists.",

    "abstract": "Ordinal regression with anchored reference samples (ORARS) has been proposed\nfor predicting the subjective Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of input stimuli\nautomatically. The ORARS addresses the MOS prediction problem by pairing a test\nsample with each of the pre-scored anchored reference samples. A trained binary\nclassifier is then used to predict which sample, test or anchor, is better\nstatistically. Posteriors of the binary preference decision are then used to\npredict the MOS of the test sample. In this paper, rigorous framework,\nanalysis, and experiments to demonstrate that ORARS are advantageous over\nsimple regressions are presented. The contributions of this work are: 1) Show\nthat traditional regression can be reformulated into multiple preference tests\nto yield a better performance, which is confirmed with simulations\nexperimentally; 2) Generalize ORARS to other regression problems and verify its\neffectiveness; 3) Provide some prerequisite conditions which can insure proper\napplication of ORARS.",

In this paper, we proposed a learning system for\nmotion planning of free-float dual-arm space manipulator (FFDASM) towards\nnon-cooperative objects. Specifically, our method consists of two modules.\nModule I realizes the multi-target trajectory planning for two end-effectors\nwithin a large target space. Next, Module II takes as input the point clouds of\nthe non-cooperative object to estimate the motional property, and then can\npredict the position of target points on an non-cooperative object. We\nleveraged the combination of Module I and Module II to track target points on a\nspinning object with unknown regularity successfully.

As the initial stage of RS, large-scale matching is\nfundamental yet challenging. A typical recipe is to learn user and item\nrepresentations with a two-tower architecture and then calculate the similarity\nscore between both representation vectors, which however still struggles in how\nto properly deal with negative samples. In this paper, we find that the common\npractice that randomly sampling negative samples from the entire space and\ntreating them equally is not an optimal choice, since the negative samples from\ndifferent sub-spaces at different stages have different importance to a\nmatching model. To address this issue, we propose a novel method named Unbiased\nModel-Agnostic Matching Approach (UMA$^2$). It consists of two basic modules\nincluding 1) General Matching Model (GMM), which is model-agnostic and can be\nimplemented as any embedding-based two-tower models; and 2) Negative Samples\nDebias Network (NSDN), which discriminates negative samples by borrowing the\nidea of Inverse Propensity Weighting (IPW) and re-weighs the loss in GMM.\nUMA$^2$ seamlessly integrates these two modules in an end-to-end multi-task\nlearning framework.

One group of recent state-of-the-art metrics that mitigates some of\nthose flaws are Deep Perceptual Similarity (DPS) metrics, where the similarity\nis evaluated as the distance in the deep features of neural networks. However,\nDPS metrics themselves have been less thoroughly examined for their benefits\nand, especially, their flaws. This work investigates the most common DPS\nmetric, where deep features are compared by spatial position, along with\nmetrics comparing the averaged and sorted deep features. The metrics are\nanalyzed in-depth to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the metrics by\nusing images designed specifically to challenge them. This work contributes\nwith new insights into the flaws of DPS, and further suggests improvements to\nthe metrics.

    "abstract": "As online merchandise become more common, many studies focus on\nembedding-based methods where queries and products are represented in the\nsemantic space. These methods alleviate the problem of vocab mismatch between\nthe language of queries and products. However, past studies usually dealt with\nqueries that precisely describe the product, and there still exists the need to\nanswer imprecise queries that may require common sense knowledge, i.e., 'what\nshould I get my mom for Mother's Day.' In this paper, we propose a GPT-3 based\nproduct retrieval system that leverages the knowledge-base (KB) of GPT-3 for\nquestion answering; users do not need to know the specific illustrative\nkeywords for a product when querying. Our method tunes prompt tokens of GPT-3\nto prompt knowledge and render answers that are mapped directly to products\nwithout further processing. Our method shows consistent performance improvement\non two real-world and one public dataset, compared to the baseline methods. We\nprovide an in-depth discussion on leveraging GPT-3 knowledge into a question\nanswering based retrieval system.",

    "abstract": "Blockchains are modern distributed systems that provide decentralized\nfinancial capabilities with trustable guarantees. Smart contracts are programs\nwritten in specialized programming languages running on a blockchain and govern\nhow tokens and cryptocurrency are sent and received. Smart contracts can invoke\nother contracts during the execution of transactions initiated by external\nusers.\nOnce deployed, smart contracts cannot be modified and their pitfalls can\ncause malfunctions and losses, for example by attacks from malicious users.\nRuntime verification is a very appealing technique to improve the reliability\nof smart contracts. One approach consists of specifying undesired executions\n(never claims) and detecting violations of the specification on the fly. This\ncan be done by extending smart contracts with additional instructions\ncorresponding to monitor specified properties, resulting in an onchain\nmonitoring approach.\nIn this paper, we study transaction monitoring that consists of detecting\nviolations of complete transaction executions and not of individual operations\nwithin transactions. Our main contributions are to show that transaction\nmonitoring is not possible in most blockchains and propose different execution\nmechanisms that would enable transaction monitoring.",

The implementation is agnostic to the choice of\nresource manager but assumes the system exposes a HTTP/HTTPS API for its\ncontrol/management.

    "abstract": "Energy efficiency is at the core of sustainability solutions for 5/6G\nnetworks. We argue this is a too narrow perspective on sustainability, as it\nignores the effects of the increased traffic demand these networks stimulate\nand the need for additional equipment that this demand requires. The hope is\nthat techniques to reduce the network's energy consumption in operation will be\nable to compensate for increases in traffic demand. However, there are more\nchallenges than just reducing the energy that the network requires to function\nand it is not clear whether higher energy efficiency will be able to cope with\nincreasing demand. The need for more equipment related to deployment of 5/6G\nnetworks may result in important environmental impacts: i) increased pressures\non material extraction, which imply socio-environmental conflicts, ecosystem\ndestruction and displacement, ii) more manufacturing and shipment, with effects\non greenhouse gas emissions and pollution; iii) increased disposal complexities\nand challenges to recycle components of such equipments. By extending our view\non sustainability to include the aforementioned often ignored implications, we\nare able to identify design requirements and technical pillars of 5/6G networks\nthat need to be rethought. We also devise new paths forward to address these\nchallenges. We argue that it is crucial to think of alternative applications\nand requirements that aim to serve user demands explicitly, instead of\nincessantly creating new needs.

Applications of machine learning algorithms for the\ndevelopment of accurate and cost-efficient surrogates of complex problems have\nalready attracted major attention from scientists. Despite their powerful\napproximation capabilities, however, surrogates cannot produce the `exact'\nsolution to the problem. To address this issue, this paper exploits up-to-date\nML tools and delivers customized iterative solvers of linear equation systems,\ncapable of solving large-scale parametrized problems at any desired level of\naccuracy. Specifically, the proposed approach consists of the following two\nsteps. At first, a reduced set of model evaluations is performed and the\ncorresponding solutions are used to establish an approximate mapping from the\nproblem's parametric space to its solution space using deep feedforward neural\nnetworks and convolutional autoencoders. This mapping serves a means to obtain\nvery accurate initial predictions of the system's response to new query points\nat negligible computational cost. Subsequently, an iterative solver inspired by\nthe Algebraic Multigrid method in combination with Proper Orthogonal\nDecomposition, termed POD-2G, is developed that successively refines the\ninitial predictions towards the exact system solutions. The application of\nPOD-2G as a standalone solver or as preconditioner in the context of\npreconditioned conjugate gradient methods is demonstrated on several numerical\nexamples of large scale systems, with the results indicating its superiority\nover conventional iterative solution schemes.",

It is shown\nthat the consistent couple stress theory provides an objective definition of\nrotation compared with the Cauchy theory but additional regularisation (or\nother techniques) is required to overcome mesh/size dependency in softening or\nfracture related problems. In the case of hardening continuum problems and/or\nlarge characteristic lengths, the proposed formulation and elements offer a\nmore reliable approach to model structures with both translational and\nrotational degrees of freedom.",

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) deliver the powerful capability\nto embed rich structural and semantic information of a heterogeneous graph into\nlow-dimensional node representations. Existing HGNNs usually learn to embed\ninformation using hierarchy attention mechanism and repeated neighbor\naggregation, suffering from unnecessary complexity and redundant computation.\nThis paper proposes Simple and Efficient Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network\n(SeHGNN) which reduces this excess complexity through avoiding overused\nnode-level attention within the same relation and pre-computing the neighbor\naggregation in the pre-processing stage. Unlike previous work, SeHGNN utilizes\na light-weight parameter-free neighbor aggregator to learn structural\ninformation for each metapath, and a transformer-based semantic aggregator to\ncombine semantic information across metapaths for the final embedding of each\nnode. As a result, SeHGNN offers the simple network structure, high prediction\naccuracy, and fast training speed. Extensive experiments on five real-world\nheterogeneous graphs demonstrate the superiority of SeHGNN over the\nstate-of-the-arts on both the accuracy and training speed.

Its basic assumption is that if two scalar\nvalues/scalar-value combinations have similar contexts, they usually have high\nsimilarity in terms of features.

Recent studies have shown that Generative Adversarial Networks\n(GANs) have the potential to shed light on this task. However, existing\nGAN-based models are limited by the sparsity of urban data and instability in\nmodel training, hampering their applications. Here, we propose a GAN framework\nwith geographical knowledge, namely Metropolitan GAN (MetroGAN), for urban\nmorphology simulation. We incorporate a progressive growing structure to learn\nhierarchical features and design a geographical loss to impose the constraints\nof water areas. Besides, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework for\nthe complex structure of urban systems. Results show that MetroGAN outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art urban simulation methods by over 20% in all metrics.\nInspiringly, using physical geography features singly, MetroGAN can still\ngenerate shapes of the cities. These results demonstrate that MetroGAN solves\nthe instability problem of previous urban simulation GANs and is generalizable\nto deal with various urban attributes.",

    "abstract": "Current deep video quality assessment (VQA) methods are usually with high\ncomputational costs when evaluating high-resolution videos. This cost hinders\nthem from learning better video-quality-related representations via end-to-end\ntraining. Existing approaches typically consider naive sampling to reduce the\ncomputational cost, such as resizing and cropping. However, they obviously\ncorrupt quality-related information in videos and are thus not optimal for\nlearning good representations for VQA. Therefore, there is an eager need to\ndesign a new quality-retained sampling scheme for VQA. In this paper, we\npropose Grid Mini-patch Sampling (GMS), which allows consideration of local\nquality by sampling patches at their raw resolution and covers global quality\nwith contextual relations via mini-patches sampled in uniform grids. These\nmini-patches are spliced and aligned temporally, named as fragments. We further\nbuild the Fragment Attention Network (FANet) specially designed to accommodate\nfragments as inputs. Consisting of fragments and FANet, the proposed FrAgment\nSample Transformer for VQA (FAST-VQA) enables efficient end-to-end deep VQA and\nlearns effective video-quality-related representations. It improves\nstate-of-the-art accuracy by around 10% while reducing 99.5% FLOPs on 1080P\nhigh-resolution videos. The newly learned video-quality-related representations\ncan also be transferred into smaller VQA datasets, boosting performance in\nthese scenarios. Extensive experiments show that FAST-VQA has good performance\non inputs of various resolutions while retaining high efficiency. We publish\nour code at https://github.com/timothyhtimothy/FAST-VQA.",

    "abstract": "Concurrent multi-player games with $\\omega$-regular objectives are a standard\nmodel for systems that consist of several interacting components, each with its\nown objective. The standard solution concept for such games is Nash\nEquilibrium, which is a \"stable\" strategy profile for the players.\nIn many settings, the system is not fully observable by the interacting\ncomponents, e.g., due to internal variables. Then, the interaction is modelled\nby a partial information game. Unfortunately, the problem of whether a partial\ninformation game has an NE is not known to be decidable. A particular setting\nof partial information arises naturally when processes are assigned IDs by the\nsystem, but these IDs are not known to the processes. Then, the processes have\nfull information about the state of the system, but are uncertain of the effect\nof their actions on the transitions.\nWe generalize the setting above and introduce Multi-Topology Games (MTGs) --\nconcurrent games with several possible topologies, where the players do not\nknow which topology is actually used. We show that extending the concept of NE\nto these games can take several forms. To this end, we propose two notions of\nNE: Conservative NE, in which a player deviates if she can strictly add\ntopologies to her winning set, and Greedy NE, where she deviates if she can win\nin a previously-losing topology. We study the properties of these NE, and show\nthat the problem of whether a game admits them is decidable.",

Considering that the joint beamforming with large-scale array\nelements at transceivers and RIS is extremely complicated, the codebook based\nbeamforming can be employed in a computationally efficient manner. However, the\ncodeword selection for analog beamforming is an intractable combinatorial\noptimization (CO) problem. To this end, an iterative alternating search (IAS)\nalgorithm is developed to achieve a near-optimal sum-rate performance with low\ncomputational complexity in contrast with the optimal exhaustive search\nalgorithm. According to the THz channel dataset generated by the IAS algorithm,\na multi-task learning based analog beam selection (MTL-ABS) framework is\ndeveloped to further decrease the computation overhead. Specifically, we take\nthe CO problem as a multi-task classification problem and implement multiple\nbeam selection tasks at transceivers and RIS simultaneously.

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) models are typically optimized for their accuracy on a\ngiven dataset. However, this predictive criterion rarely captures all desirable\nproperties of a model, in particular how well it matches a domain expert's\nunderstanding of a task. Underspecification refers to the existence of multiple\nmodels that are indistinguishable in their in-domain accuracy, even though they\ndiffer in other desirable properties such as out-of-distribution (OOD)\nperformance. Identifying these situations is critical for assessing the\nreliability of ML models.\nWe formalize the concept of underspecification and propose a method to\nidentify and partially address it. We train multiple models with an\nindependence constraint that forces them to implement different functions. They\ndiscover predictive features that are otherwise ignored by standard empirical\nrisk minimization (ERM), which we then distill into a global model with\nsuperior OOD performance. Importantly, we constrain the models to align with\nthe data manifold to ensure that they discover meaningful features. We\ndemonstrate the method on multiple datasets in computer vision (collages,\nWILDS-Camelyon17, GQA) and discuss general implications of underspecification.\nMost notably, in-domain performance cannot serve for OOD model selection\nwithout additional assumptions.",

    "abstract": "Point cloud semantic segmentation from projected views, such as range-view\n(RV) and bird's-eye-view (BEV), has been intensively investigated. Different\nviews capture different information of point clouds and thus are complementary\nto each other. However, recent projection-based methods for point cloud\nsemantic segmentation usually utilize a vanilla late fusion strategy for the\npredictions of different views, failing to explore the complementary\ninformation from a geometric perspective during the representation learning. In\nthis paper, we introduce a geometric flow network (GFNet) to explore the\ngeometric correspondence between different views in an align-before-fuse\nmanner. Specifically, we devise a novel geometric flow module (GFM) to\nbidirectionally align and propagate the complementary information across\ndifferent views according to geometric relationships under the end-to-end\nlearning scheme. We perform extensive experiments on two widely used benchmark\ndatasets, SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nGFNet for project-based point cloud semantic segmentation. Concretely, GFNet\nnot only significantly boosts the performance of each individual view but also\nachieves state-of-the-art results over all existing projection-based models.\nCode is available at \\url{https://github.com/haibo-qiu/GFNet}.",

These two approaches exhibit different failure modes. Consequently,\nhybrid algorithms present an attractive research goal. Unfortunately, dense\nanomaly detection requires translational equivariance and very large input\nresolutions. These requirements disqualify all previous hybrid approaches to\nthe best of our knowledge. We therefore design a novel hybrid algorithm based\non reinterpreting discriminative logits as a logarithm of the unnormalized\njoint distribution $\\hat{p}(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y})$. Our model builds on a\nshared convolutional representation from which we recover three dense\npredictions: i) the closed-set class posterior $P(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{x})$, ii)\nthe dataset posterior $P(d_{in}|\\mathbf{x})$, iii) unnormalized data likelihood\n$\\hat{p}(\\mathbf{x})$. The latter two predictions are trained both on the\nstandard training data and on a generic negative dataset. We blend these two\npredictions into a hybrid anomaly score which allows dense open-set recognition\non large natural images. We carefully design a custom loss for the data\nlikelihood in order to avoid backpropagation through the untractable\nnormalizing constant $Z(\\theta)$.

One appealing way of\nintegrating fairness aspects into classical clustering problems is by\nintroducing multiple covering constraints. This is a natural generalization of\nthe robust (or outlier) setting, which has been studied extensively and is\namenable to a variety of classic algorithmic techniques. In contrast, for the\ncase of multiple covering constraints (the so-called colorful setting),\nspecialized techniques have only been developed recently for $k$-Center\nclustering variants, which is also the focus of this paper. While prior\ntechniques assume covering constraints on the clients, they do not address\nadditional constraints on the facilities, which has been extensively studied in\nnon-colorful settings.\nIn this paper, we present a quite versatile framework to deal with various\nconstraints on the facilities in the colorful setting, by combining ideas from\nthe iterative greedy procedure for Colorful $k$-Center by Inamdar and\nVaradarajan with new ingredients. To exemplify our framework, we show how it\nleads, for a constant number $\\gamma$ of colors, to the first constant-factor\napproximations for both Colorful Matroid Supplier with respect to a linear\nmatroid and Colorful Knapsack Supplier. In both cases, we readily get an\n$O(2^\\gamma)$-approximation.\nMoreover, for Colorful Knapsack Supplier, we show that it is possible to\nobtain constant approximation guarantees that are independent of the number of\ncolors $\\gamma$, as long as $\\gamma=O(1)$, which is needed to obtain a\npolynomial running time. More precisely, we obtain a $7$-approximation by\nextending a technique recently introduced by Jia, Sheth, and Svensson for\nColorful $k$-Center.",

Software masking is a software\nmitigation approach against power side-channel attacks, aiming at hiding the\nsecret-revealing dependencies from the power footprint of a vulnerable\nimplementation. However, this type of software mitigation often depends on\ngeneral-purpose compilers, which do not preserve non-functional properties.\nMoreover, microarchitectural features, such as the memory bus and register\nreuse, may also reveal secret information. These abstractions are not visible\nat the high-level implementation of the program. Instead, they are decided at\ncompile time.

    "abstract": "Providing Internet connectivity to schools has been identified as paramount\nfor development, for instance in the Giga project, cosponsored by ITU and\nUNICEF, with the goal of connecting every school to the Internet by 2030. For a\ncountry wide deployment, it is imperative to perform a thorough planning of the\nwhole installation, using radio frequency (RF) propagation models. While\nstatistical models based on empirical RF propagation data gathered in different\nscenarios can be employed, for point to point links at microwave frequencies\nthe existence of a clear line of sight (LOS) is normally a prerequisite. The\nIrregular terrain model which makes use of digital elevation maps (DEM) has\nproved quite effective for simulating point to point links, but its application\nto a great number of links becomes time consuming, so we have developed an\nautomated framework to perform this task. As a case study we have applied this\nframework in the planning of a project mired at providing connectivity to\nprimary and secondary schools all over the country of Malawi.",

    "abstract": "Video-based person re-identification (ReID) is challenging due to the\npresence of various interferences in video frames. Recent approaches handle\nthis problem using temporal aggregation strategies. In this work, we propose a\nnovel Context Sensing Attention Network (CSA-Net), which improves both the\nframe feature extraction and temporal aggregation steps. First, we introduce\nthe Context Sensing Channel Attention (CSCA) module, which emphasizes responses\nfrom informative channels for each frame. These informative channels are\nidentified with reference not only to each individual frame, but also to the\ncontent of the entire sequence. Therefore, CSCA explores both the individuality\nof each frame and the global context of the sequence. Second, we propose the\nContrastive Feature Aggregation (CFA) module, which predicts frame weights for\ntemporal aggregation. Here, the weight for each frame is determined in a\ncontrastive manner: i.e., not only by the quality of each individual frame, but\nalso by the average quality of the other frames in a sequence. Therefore, it\neffectively promotes the contribution of relatively good frames. Extensive\nexperimental results on four datasets show that CSA-Net consistently achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance.",

    "abstract": "Channel pruning is widely used to reduce the complexity of deep network\nmodels. Recent pruning methods usually identify which parts of the network to\ndiscard by proposing a channel importance criterion. However, recent studies\nhave shown that these criteria do not work well in all conditions. In this\npaper, we propose a novel Feature Shift Minimization (FSM) method to compress\nCNN models, which evaluates the feature shift by converging the information of\nboth features and filters. Specifically, we first investigate the compression\nefficiency with some prevalent methods in different layer-depths and then\npropose the feature shift concept. Then, we introduce an approximation method\nto estimate the magnitude of the feature shift, since it is difficult to\ncompute it directly. Besides, we present a distribution-optimization algorithm\nto compensate for the accuracy loss and improve the network compression\nefficiency. The proposed method yields state-of-the-art performance on various\nbenchmark networks and datasets, verified by extensive experiments.

    "abstract": "Rational verification refers to the problem of checking which temporal logic\nproperties hold of a concurrent multiagent system, under the assumption that\nagents in the system choose strategies that form a game-theoretic equilibrium.\nRational verification can be understood as a counterpart to model checking for\nmultiagent systems, but while classical model checking can be done in\npolynomial time for some temporal logic specification languages such as CTL,\nand polynomial space with LTL specifications, rational verification is much\nharder: the key decision problems for rational verification are\n2EXPTIME-complete with LTL specifications, even when using explicit-state\nsystem representations. Against this background, our contributions in this\npaper are threefold. First, we show that the complexity of rational\nverification can be greatly reduced by restricting specifications to GR(1), a\nfragment of LTL that can represent a broad and practically useful class of\nresponse properties of reactive systems. In particular, we show that for a\nnumber of relevant settings, rational verification can be done in polynomial\nspace and even in polynomial time. Second, we provide improved complexity\nresults for rational verification when considering players' goals given by\nmean-payoff utility functions; arguably the most widely used approach for\nquantitative objectives in concurrent and multiagent systems. Finally, we\nconsider the problem of computing outcomes that satisfy social welfare\nconstraints. To this end, we consider both utilitarian and egalitarian social\nwelfare and show that computing such outcomes is either PSPACE-complete or\nNP-complete.",

This study is the\nfirst to investigate the robustness of visually grounded dialog models towards\ntextual attacks. These attacks represent a worst-case scenario where the input\nquestion contains a synonym which causes the previously correct model to return\na wrong answer. Using this scenario, we first aim to understand how multimodal\ninput components contribute to model robustness. Our results show that models\nwhich encode dialog history are more robust, and when launching an attack on\nhistory, model prediction becomes more uncertain. This is in contrast to prior\nwork which finds that dialog history is negligible for model performance on\nthis task. We also evaluate how to generate adversarial test examples which\nsuccessfully fool the model but remain undetected by the user/software\ndesigner. We find that the textual, as well as the visual context are important\nto generate plausible worst-case scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Many modern sequential recommender systems use deep neural networks, which\ncan effectively estimate the relevance of items but require a lot of time to\ntrain. Slow training increases expenses, hinders product development timescales\nand prevents the model from being regularly updated to adapt to changing user\npreferences. Training such sequential models involves appropriately sampling\npast user interactions to create a realistic training objective. The existing\ntraining objectives have limitations. For instance, next item prediction never\nuses the beginning of the sequence as a learning target, thereby potentially\ndiscarding valuable data. On the other hand, the item masking used by BERT4Rec\nis only weakly related to the goal of the sequential recommendation; therefore,\nit requires much more time to obtain an effective model. Hence, we propose a\nnovel Recency-based Sampling of Sequences training objective that addresses\nboth limitations. We apply our method to various recent and state-of-the-art\nmodel architectures - such as GRU4Rec, Caser, and SASRec. We show that the\nmodels enhanced with our method can achieve performances exceeding or very\nclose to stateof-the-art BERT4Rec, but with much less training time.",

    "abstract": "Augmented Reality (AR) see-through vision is an interesting research topic\nsince it enables users to see through a wall and see the occluded objects. Most\nexisting research focuses on the visual effects of see-through vision, while\nthe interaction method is less studied. However, we argue that using common\ninteraction modalities, e.g., midair click and speech, may not be the optimal\nway to control see-through vision. This is because when we want to see through\nsomething, it is physically related to our gaze depth/vergence and thus should\nbe naturally controlled by the eyes. Following this idea, this paper proposes a\nnovel gaze-vergence-controlled (GVC) see-through vision technique in AR. Since\ngaze depth is needed, we build a gaze tracking module with two infrared cameras\nand the corresponding algorithm and assemble it into the Microsoft HoloLens 2\nto achieve gaze depth estimation. We then propose two different GVC modes for\nsee-through vision to fit different scenarios. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that our gaze depth estimation is efficient and accurate. By\ncomparing with conventional interaction modalities, our GVC techniques are also\nshown to be superior in terms of efficiency and more preferred by users.\nFinally, we present four example applications of gaze-vergence-controlled\nsee-through vision.",

Firstly, we investigate the fractional programing to convert the\nweighted sum-rate (WSR) maximization problem into a tractable optimization\nproblem. Then, the alternating optimization framework is employed to decompose\nthe transformed problem into a sequence of subproblems, i.e., hybrid BF (HBF)\nat BSs, passive BF at RISs, and combining at users. In particular, the\nalternating direction method of multipliers algorithm is utilized to solve the\nHBF subproblem at BSs. Concretely, the analog BF design with unit-modulus\nconstraints is solved by the manifold optimization (MO) while we obtain a\nclosed-form solution to the digital BF design that is essentially a convex\nleast-square problem. Additionally, the passive BF at RISs and the analog\ncombining at users are designed by primal-dual subgradient and MO methods.\nMoreover, considering heavy communication costs in conventional CF-mMIMO\nsystems, we propose a partially-connected CF-mMIMO (P-CF-mMIMO) framework to\ndecrease the number of connections among BSs and users. To better compromise\nWSR performance and network costs, we formulate the BS selection problem in the\nP-CF-mMIMO system as a binary integer quadratic programming (BIQP) problem, and\ndevelop a relaxed linear approximation algorithm to handle this BIQP problem.\nFinally, numerical results demonstrate superiorities of our proposed algorithms\nover baseline counterparts.",

In previous\npublications, it was shown that using magnetorheological (MR) actuators coupled\nwith hydrostatic transmissions provides high power density and great open-loop\nhuman-robot interactions. Still, the open-loop force fidelity at low and high\nfrequencies are decreased by the transmission's dynamics and by nonlinear\nfriction.

Four control\napproaches are developed and compared experimentally: (1) Open-loop control\nwith friction compensation; (2) non-collocated pressure feedback; (3)\ncollocated pressure feedback; (4) LQGI state feedback. A dither strategy is\nalso implemented to smoothen ball screw friction. Results show that approaches\n(1), (2) and (3) can increase the performances but are facing compromises,\nwhile approach (4) can simultaneously improve all metrics.

    "abstract": "In this technical report, we briefly introduce the solutions of our team\n`PKU-WICT-MIPL' for the PIC Makeup Temporal Video Grounding (MTVG) Challenge in\nACM-MM 2022. Given an untrimmed makeup video and a step query, the MTVG aims to\nlocalize a temporal moment of the target makeup step in the video. To tackle\nthis task, we propose a phrase relationship mining framework to exploit the\ntemporal localization relationship relevant to the fine-grained phrase and the\nwhole sentence. Besides, we propose to constrain the localization results of\ndifferent step sentence queries to not overlap with each other through a\ndynamic programming algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method. Our final submission ranked 2nd on the\nleaderboard, with only a 0.55\\% gap from the first.",

The semilinear home-space problem for\nPetri nets asks, given a Petri net $A$, and semilinear sets of configurations\n$\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{H}$ if $\\mathbf{H}$ is an home-space for $\\mathbf{X}$. In\n1989, Davide de Frutos Escrig and Colette Johnen proved that the problem is\ndecidable when $\\mathbf{X}$ is a singleton and $\\mathbf{H}$ is a finite union\nof linear sets using the same periods. In this paper, we show that the general\nproblem is decidable. This result is obtained by proving a duality between the\nreachability problem and the non-home-space problem. More formally, we prove\nthat for any Petri net $A$ and for any linear set of configurations\n$\\mathbf{L}$, we can effectively compute a semilinear set $\\mathbf{W}$ of\nconfigurations such that for every set $\\mathbf{X}$, the set $\\mathbf{L}$ is\nnot an home-space for $\\mathbf{X}$ if, and only if $\\mathbf{W}$ is reachable\nfrom $\\mathbf{X}$.",

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable intelligent surface is a potential technology component of\nfuture wireless networks due to its capability of shaping the wireless\nenvironment. The promising MIMO systems in terms of extended coverage and\nenhanced capacity are, however, critically dependent on the accuracy of the\nchannel state information. However, traditional channel estimation schemes are\nnot applicable in RIS-assisted MIMO networks, since passive RISs typically lack\nthe signal processing capabilities that are assumed by channel estimation\nalgorithms. This becomes most problematic when physical imperfections or\nelectronic impairments affect the RIS due to its exposition to different\nenvironmental effects or caused by hardware limitations from the circuitry.\nWhile these real-world effects are typically ignored in the literature, in this\npaper we propose efficient channel estimation schemes for RIS-assisted MIMO\nsystems taking different imperfections into account. Specifically, we propose\ntwo sets of tensor-based algorithms, based on the parallel factor analysis\ndecomposition schemes. First, by assuming a long-term model in which the RIS\nimperfections, modeled as unknown phase shifts, are static within the channel\ncoherence time we formulate an iterative alternating least squares (ALS)-based\nalgorithm for the joint estimation of the communication channels and the\nunknown phase deviations. Next, we develop the short-term imperfection model,\nwhich allows both amplitude and phase RIS imperfections to be non-static with\nrespect to the channel coherence time. We propose two iterative ALS-based and\nclosed-form higher order singular value decomposition-based algorithms for the\njoint estimation of the channels and the unknown impairments. Moreover, we\nanalyze the identifiability and computational complexity of the proposed\nalgorithms and study the effects of various imperfections on the channel\nestimation quality.",

    "abstract": "Spiking neural network (SNN) has been attached to great importance due to the\nproperties of high biological plausibility and low energy consumption on\nneuromorphic hardware. As an efficient method to obtain deep SNN, the\nconversion method has exhibited high performance on various large-scale\ndatasets. However, it typically suffers from severe performance degradation and\nhigh time delays. In particular, most of the previous work focuses on simple\nclassification tasks while ignoring the precise approximation to ANN output. In\nthis paper, we first theoretically analyze the conversion errors and derive the\nharmful effects of time-varying extremes on synaptic currents. We propose the\nSpike Calibration (SpiCalib) to eliminate the damage of discrete spikes to the\noutput distribution and modify the LIPooling to allow conversion of the\narbitrary MaxPooling layer losslessly. Moreover, Bayesian optimization for\noptimal normalization parameters is proposed to avoid empirical settings. The\nexperimental results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance on\nclassification, object detection, and segmentation tasks. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first time to obtain SNN comparable to ANN on these\ntasks simultaneously. Moreover, we only need 1/50 inference time of the\nprevious work on the detection task and can achieve the same performance under\n0.492$\\times$ energy consumption of ANN on the segmentation task.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) can be conveniently deployed while empowering\nvarious applications, where the IoT nodes can form clusters to finish certain\nmissions collectively. In this paper, we propose to employ unmanned aerial\nvehicles (UAVs) to assist the clustered IoT data collection with\nblockchain-based security provisioning. In particular, the UAVs generate\ncandidate blocks based on the collected data, which are then audited through a\nlightweight proof-of-stake consensus mechanism within the UAV-based blockchain\nnetwork. To motivate efficient blockchain while reducing the operational cost,\na stake pool is constructed at the active UAV while encouraging stake\ninvestment from other UAVs with profit sharing. The problem is formulated to\nmaximize the overall profit through the blockchain system in unit time by\njointly investigating the IoT transmission, incentives through investment and\nprofit sharing, and UAV deployment strategies. Then, the problem is solved in a\ndistributed manner while being decoupled into two layers. The inner layer\nincorporates IoT transmission and incentive design, which are tackled with\nlarge-system approximation and one-leader-multi-follower Stackelberg game\nanalysis, respectively. The outer layer for UAV deployment is undertaken with a\nmulti-agent deep deterministic policy gradient approach. Results show the\nconvergence of the proposed learning process and the UAV deployment, and also\ndemonstrated is the performance superiority of our proposal as compared with\nthe baselines.",

More precisely, on an $m_1\\times m_2 \\times\nm_3$ grid, $m_1\\ge m_2\\ge m_3$, our method computes solutions for routing up to\n$\\frac{m_1m_2m_3}{3}$ uniquely labeled robots with uniformly randomly\ndistributed start and goal configurations within a makespan of $m_1 + 2m_2\n+2m_3+o(m_1)$, with high probability. Because the makespan lower bound for such\ninstances is $m_1 + m_2+m_3 - o(m_1)$, also with high probability, as $m_1 \\to\n\\infty$, $\\frac{m_1+2m_2+2m_3}{m_1+m_2+m_3}$ optimality guarantee is achieved.\n$\\frac{m_1+2m_2+2m_3}{m_1+m_2+m_3} \\in (1, \\frac{5}{3}]$, yielding $1.x$\noptimality. In contrast, it is well-known that multi-robot path planning is\nNP-hard to optimally solve. In numerical evaluations, our method readily scales\nto support the motion planning of over $100,000$ robots in 3D while\nsimultaneously achieving $1.x$ optimality.

    "abstract": "Counterfactual explanations inform ways to achieve a desired outcome from a\nmachine learning model. However, such explanations are not robust to certain\nreal-world changes in the underlying model (e.g., retraining the model,\nchanging hyperparameters, etc.), questioning their reliability in several\napplications, e.g., credit lending. In this work, we propose a novel strategy\n-- that we call RobX -- to generate robust counterfactuals for tree-based\nensembles, e.g., XGBoost. Tree-based ensembles pose additional challenges in\nrobust counterfactual generation, e.g., they have a non-smooth and\nnon-differentiable objective function, and they can change a lot in the\nparameter space under retraining on very similar data. We first introduce a\nnovel metric -- that we call Counterfactual Stability -- that attempts to\nquantify how robust a counterfactual is going to be to model changes under\nretraining, and comes with desirable theoretical properties. Our proposed\nstrategy RobX works with any counterfactual generation method (base method) and\nsearches for robust counterfactuals by iteratively refining the counterfactual\ngenerated by the base method using our metric Counterfactual Stability. We\ncompare the performance of RobX with popular counterfactual generation methods\n(for tree-based ensembles) across benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate\nthat our strategy generates counterfactuals that are significantly more robust\n(nearly 100% validity after actual model changes) and also realistic (in terms\nof local outlier factor) over existing state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Asynchronously replicated primary-backup databases are commonly deployed to\nimprove availability and offload read-only transactions. To both apply\nreplicated writes from the primary and serve read-only transactions, the\nbackups implement a cloned concurrency control protocol. The protocol ensures\nread-only transactions always return a snapshot of state that previously\nexisted on the primary. This compels the backup to exactly copy the commit\norder resulting from the primary's concurrency control. Existing cloned\nconcurrency control protocols guarantee this by limiting the backup's\nparallelism. As a result, the primary's concurrency control executes some\nworkloads with more parallelism than these protocols. In this paper, we prove\nthat this parallelism gap leads to unbounded replication lag, where writes can\ntake arbitrarily long to replicate to the backup and which has led to\ncatastrophic failures in production systems. We then design C5, the first\ncloned concurrency protocol to provide bounded replication lag. We implement\ntwo versions of C5: Our evaluation in MyRocks, a widely deployed database,\ndemonstrates C5 provides bounded replication lag.

    "abstract": "Achieving the human-level safety performance for autonomous vehicles (AVs)\nremains a challenge. One critical bottleneck is the so-called \"long-tail\nchallenge\", which usually refers to the problem that AVs should be able to\nhandle seemingly endless low-probability safety-critical driving scenarios,\neven though millions of testing miles have been accumulated on public roads.\nHowever, there is neither rigorous definition nor analysis of properties of\nsuch problems, which hinders the progress of addressing them. In this paper, we\nsystematically analyze the \"long-tail challenge\" and propose the concept of\n\"curse of rarity\" (CoR) for AVs. We conclude that the compounding effects of\nthe CoR on top of the \"curse of dimensionality\" (CoD) are the root cause of the\n\"long-tail challenge\", because of the rarity of safety-critical events in high\ndimensionality of driving environments. We discuss the CoR in various aspects\nof AV development including perception, prediction, and planning, as well as\nvalidation and verification. Based on these analyses and discussions, we\npropose potential solutions to address the CoR in order to accelerate AV\ndevelopment and deployment.",

In this work we address the above gap, and introduce Graph Trees\nwith Attention (GTA), a new family of tree-based learning algorithms that are\ndesigned to operate on graphs. GTA leverages both the graph structure and the\nfeatures at the vertices and employs an attention mechanism that allows\ndecisions to concentrate on sub-structures of the graph. We analyze GTA models\nand show that they are strictly more expressive than plain decision trees. We\nalso demonstrate the benefits of GTA empirically on multiple graph and node\nprediction benchmarks. In these experiments, GTA always outperformed other\ntree-based models and often outperformed other types of graph-learning\nalgorithms such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Kernels. Finally, we\nalso provide an explainability mechanism for GTA, and demonstrate it can\nprovide intuitive explanations.",

    "abstract": "Tabular data is one of the most common data storage formats in business\napplications, ranging from retail, bank and E-commerce. These applications rely\nheavily on machine learning models to achieve business success. One of the\ncritical problems in learning tabular data is to distinguish influential\nfeatures from all the predetermined features. Global feature selection has been\nwell-studied for quite some time, assuming that all instances have the same\ninfluential feature subsets. However, different instances rely on different\nfeature subsets in practice, which also gives rise to that instance-wise\nfeature selection receiving increasing attention in recent studies. In this\npaper, we first propose a novel method for discovering instance-wise\ninfluential features for tabular data (DIWIFT), the core of which is to\nintroduce the influence function to measure the importance of an instance-wise\nfeature. DIWIFT is capable of automatically discovering influential feature\nsubsets of different sizes in different instances, which is different from\nglobal feature selection that considers all instances with the same influential\nfeature subset. On the other hand, different from the previous instance-wise\nfeature selection, DIWIFT minimizes the validation loss on the validation set\nand is thus more robust to the distribution shift existing in the training\ndataset and test dataset, which is important in tabular data. Finally, we\nconduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to\nvalidate the effectiveness of our DIWIFT, compared it with baseline methods.\nMoreover, we also demonstrate the robustness of our method via some ablation\nexperiments.",

Yet, today's solutions are unable to deliver robust\nand high tracking accuracies across multiple agents in practical, everyday\nenvironments - a feature central to the future of immersive and collaborative\napplications. This can be attributed to the limited scope of diversity\nleveraged by these fusion solutions, preventing them from catering to the\nmultiple dimensions of accuracy, robustness (diverse environmental conditions)\nand scalability (multiple agents) simultaneously. In this work, we take an\nimportant step towards this goal by introducing the notion of dual-layer\ndiversity to the problem of sensor fusion in multi-agent tracking. We\ndemonstrate that the fusion of complementary tracking modalities, -\npassive/relative (e.g., visual odometry) and active/absolute tracking (e.g.,\ninfrastructure-assisted RF localization) offer a key first layer of diversity\nthat brings scalability while the second layer of diversity lies in the\nmethodology of fusion, where we bring together the complementary strengths of\nalgorithmic (for robustness) and data-driven (for accuracy) approaches.

Recently, methods to enhance the\nperformance of SISR networks based on global feature interactions have been\nproposed.

In\naddition, a CNN-based Cross-scale Information Aggregation Module (CIAM) is\nproposed to make the model better focused on potentially practical information\nand improve the efficiency of the Transformer stage.

    "abstract": "In applications of predictive modeling, such as insurance pricing, indirect\nor proxy discrimination is an issue of major concern. Namely, there exists the\npossibility that protected policyholder characteristics are implicitly inferred\nfrom non-protected ones by predictive models, and are thus having an\nundesirable (or illegal) impact on prices. A technical solution to this problem\nrelies on building a best-estimate model using all policyholder characteristics\n(including protected ones) and then averaging out the protected characteristics\nfor calculating individual prices. However, such approaches require full\nknowledge of policyholders' protected characteristics, which may in itself be\nproblematic. Here, we address this issue by using a multi-task neural network\narchitecture for claim predictions, which can be trained using only partial\ninformation on protected characteristics, and it produces prices that are free\nfrom proxy discrimination. We demonstrate the use of the proposed model and we\nfind that its predictive accuracy is comparable to a conventional feedforward\nneural network (on full information). However, this multi-task network has\nclearly superior performance in the case of partially missing policyholder\ninformation.",

An intriguing yet challenging problem\narises: Can generative models achieve counterfactual editing against their\nlearnt priors?

Different from in-domain\nmanipulation, counterfactual manipulation requires more comprehensive\nexploitation of semantic knowledge encapsulated in CLIP as well as more\ndelicate handling of editing directions for avoiding being stuck in local\nminimum or undesired editing. To this end, we design a novel contrastive loss\nthat exploits predefined CLIP-space directions to guide the editing toward\ndesired directions from different perspectives. In addition, we design a simple\nyet effective scheme that explicitly maps CLIP embeddings (of target text) to\nthe latent space and fuses them with latent codes for effective latent code\noptimization and accurate editing.

In this model, each query returns a Boolean,\nindicating the existence of at least one edge between two specified sets of\nnodes. We present a non-adaptive algorithm that returns a $(1\\pm \\epsilon)$\nrelative error approximation to the number of edges, with query complexity\n$\\tilde O(\\epsilon^{-5}\\log^{5} n )$, where $\\tilde O(\\cdot)$ hides\n$\\textrm{poly}(\\log \\log n)$ dependencies. This is the first non-adaptive\nalgorithm in this setting achieving $\\textrm{poly}(1/\\epsilon,\\log n)$ query\ncomplexity. Prior work requires $\\Omega(\\log^2 n)$ rounds of adaptivity. We\navoid this by taking a fundamentally different approach, inspired by work on\nsingle-pass streaming algorithms. Moreover, for constant $\\epsilon$, our query\ncomplexity significantly improves on the best known adaptive algorithm due to\nBhattacharya et al.

Finally, as a consequence of our edge sampling\nalgorithm, we obtain a $\\tilde O(n\\log^ 8 n)$ query algorithm for connectivity,\nusing two rounds of adaptivity.

    "abstract": "We present a novel deep learning approach to categorical segmentation of lung\nCTs of COVID-19 patients. Specifically, we partition the scans into healthy\nlung tissues, non-lung regions, and two different, yet visually similar,\npathological lung tissues, namely, ground-glass opacity and consolidation. This\nis accomplished via a unique, end-to-end hierarchical network architecture and\nensemble learning, which contribute to the segmentation and provide a measure\nfor segmentation uncertainty. The proposed framework achieves competitive\nresults and outstanding generalization capabilities for three COVID-19\ndatasets. Our method is ranked second in a public Kaggle competition for\nCOVID-19 CT images segmentation. Moreover, segmentation uncertainty regions are\nshown to correspond to the disagreements between the manual annotations of two\ndifferent radiologists. Finally, preliminary promising correspondence results\nare shown for our private dataset when comparing the patients' COVID-19\nseverity scores (based on clinical measures), and the segmented lung\npathologies.

    "abstract": "Diffusion MRI tractography is an advanced imaging technique for quantitative\nmapping of the brain's structural connectivity. Whole brain tractography (WBT)\ndata contains over hundreds of thousands of individual fiber streamlines\n(estimated brain connections), and this data is usually parcellated to create\ncompact representations for data analysis applications such as disease\nclassification. In this paper, we propose a novel parcellation-free WBT\nanalysis framework, TractoFormer, that leverages tractography information at\nthe level of individual fiber streamlines and provides a natural mechanism for\ninterpretation of results using the attention mechanism of transformers.\nTractoFormer includes two main contributions. First, we propose a novel and\nsimple 2D image representation of WBT, TractoEmbedding, to encode 3D fiber\nspatial relationships and any feature of interest that can be computed from\nindividual fibers (such as FA or MD). Second, we design a network based on\nvision transformers (ViTs) that includes: 1) data augmentation to overcome\nmodel overfitting on small datasets, 2) identification of discriminative fibers\nfor interpretation of results, and 3) ensemble learning to leverage fiber\ninformation from different brain regions. In a synthetic data experiment,\nTractoFormer successfully identifies discriminative fibers with simulated group\ndifferences. In a disease classification experiment comparing several methods,\nTractoFormer achieves the highest accuracy in classifying schizophrenia vs\ncontrol. Discriminative fibers are identified in left hemispheric frontal and\nparietal superficial white matter regions, which have previously been shown to\nbe affected in schizophrenia patients.",

    "abstract": "Graph theoretical analyses have become standard tools in modeling functional\nand anatomical connectivity in the brain. With the advent of connectomics, the\nprimary graphs or networks of interest are structural connectome (derived from\nDTI tractography) and functional connectome (derived from resting-state fMRI).\nHowever, most published connectome studies have focused on either structural or\nfunctional connectome, yet complementary information between them, when\navailable in the same dataset, can be jointly leveraged to improve our\nunderstanding of the brain. To this end, we propose a function-constrained\nstructural graph variational autoencoder (FCS-GVAE) capable of incorporating\ninformation from both functional and structural connectome in an unsupervised\nfashion. This leads to a joint low-dimensional embedding that establishes a\nunified spatial coordinate system for comparing across different subjects. We\nevaluate our approach using the publicly available OASIS-3 Alzheimer's disease\n(AD) dataset and show that a variational formulation is necessary to optimally\nencode functional brain dynamics. Further, the proposed joint embedding\napproach can more accurately distinguish different patient sub-populations than\napproaches that do not use complementary connectome information.",

    "abstract": "We consider ramp metering at the microscopic level subject to vehicle safety\nconstraint. The traffic network is abstracted by a ring road with multiple on-\nand off-ramps. The arrival times of vehicles to the on-ramps, as well as their\ndestination off-ramps are modeled by exogenous stochastic processes. Once a\nvehicle is released from an on-ramp, it accelerates towards the free flow speed\nif it is not obstructed by another vehicle; once it gets close to another\nvehicle, it adopts a safe behavior. The vehicle exits the traffic network once\nit reaches its destination off-ramp. We design traffic-responsive ramp metering\npolicies which maximize the saturation region of the network. The saturation\nregion of a policy is defined as the set of demands, i.e., arrival rates and\nthe routing matrix, for which the queue lengths at all the on-ramps remain\nbounded in expectation. The proposed ramp metering policies operate under\nsynchronous cycles during which an on-ramp does not release more vehicles than\nits queue length at the beginning of the cycle. We provide three policies under\nwhich, respectively, each on-ramp (i) pauses release for a time-interval at the\nend of the cycle, or (ii) modulates the release rate during the cycle, or (iii)\nadopts a conservative safety criterion for release during the cycle. None of\nthe policies, however, require information about the demand. The saturation\nregion of these policies is characterized by studying stochastic stability of\nthe induced Markov chains, and is proven to be maximal when the merging speed\nof all on-ramps equals the free flow speed. Simulations are provided to\nillustrate the performance of the policies.",

Accordingly,\nunsupervised deep learning-based approaches, which learn the target image\ndistribution, often introduce CT number distortions and result in detrimental\neffects in diagnostic performance. To address this, here we propose a novel\nunsupervised learning approach for lowdose CT reconstruction using patch-wise\ndeep metric learning. The key idea is to learn embedding space by pulling the\npositive pairs of image patches which shares the same anatomical structure, and\npushing the negative pairs which have same noise level each other. Thereby, the\nnetwork is trained to suppress the noise level, while retaining the original\nglobal CT number distributions even after the image translation. Experimental\nresults confirm that our deep metric learning plays a critical role in\nproducing high quality denoised images without CT number shift.",

    "abstract": "There is often a trade-off between performance and latency in streaming\nautomatic speech recognition (ASR). Traditional methods such as look-ahead and\nchunk-based methods, usually require information from future frames to advance\nrecognition accuracy, which incurs inevitable latency even if the computation\nis fast enough. A causal model that computes without any future frames can\navoid this latency, but its performance is significantly worse than traditional\nmethods. In this paper, we propose corresponding revision strategies to improve\nthe causal model. Firstly, we introduce a real-time encoder states revision\nstrategy to modify previous states. Encoder forward computation starts once the\ndata is received and revises the previous encoder states after several frames,\nwhich is no need to wait for any right context. Furthermore, a CTC spike\nposition alignment decoding algorithm is designed to reduce time costs brought\nby the revision strategy. Experiments are all conducted on Librispeech\ndatasets. Fine-tuning on the CTC-based wav2vec2.0 model, our best method can\nachieve 3.7/9.2 WERs on test-clean/other sets, which is also competitive with\nthe chunk-based methods and the knowledge distillation methods.",

In particular, the Tamed\nUnadjusted Langevin Algorithm (TULA) was proposed in [Bro+19] to sample from\nsuch target distributions with the gradient of the potential $U$ being\nsuper-linearly growing. However, theoretical guarantees in Wasserstein\ndistances for Langevin-based algorithms have traditionally been derived\nassuming strong convexity of the potential $U$. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel taming factor and derive, under a setting with possibly non-convex\npotential $U$ and super-linearly growing gradient of $U$, non-asymptotic\ntheoretical bounds in Wasserstein-1 and Wasserstein-2 distances between the law\nof our algorithm, which we name the modified Tamed Unadjusted Langevin\nAlgorithm (mTULA), and the target distribution $\\pi_\\beta$. We obtain\nrespective rates of convergence $\\mathcal{O}(\\lambda)$ and\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\lambda^{1/2})$ in Wasserstein-1 and Wasserstein-2 distances for\nthe discretisation error of mTULA in step size $\\lambda$. High-dimensional\nnumerical simulations which support our theoretical findings are presented to\nshowcase the applicability of our algorithm.",

    "title": "When does SGD favor flat minima? A quantitative characterization via  linear stability",
    "abstract": "The observation that stochastic gradient descent (SGD) favors flat minima has\nplayed a fundamental role in understanding implicit regularization of SGD and\nguiding the tuning of hyperparameters. In this paper, we provide a quantitative\nexplanation of this striking phenomenon by relating the particular noise\nstructure of SGD to its \\emph{linear stability} (Wu et al., 2018).\nSpecifically, we consider training over-parameterized models with square loss.\nWe prove that if a global minimum $\\theta^*$ is linearly stable for SGD, then\nit must satisfy $\\|H(\\theta^*)\\|_F\\leq O(\\sqrt{B}/\\eta)$, where\n$\\|H(\\theta^*)\\|_F, B,\\eta$ denote the Frobenius norm of Hessian at $\\theta^*$,\nbatch size, and learning rate, respectively. Otherwise, SGD will escape from\nthat minimum \\emph{exponentially} fast. Hence, for minima accessible to SGD,\nthe flatness -- as measured by the Frobenius norm of the Hessian -- is bounded\nindependently of the model size and sample size. The key to obtaining these\nresults is exploiting the particular geometry awareness of SGD noise: 1) the\nnoise magnitude is proportional to loss value; 2) the noise directions\nconcentrate in the sharp directions of local landscape. This property of SGD\nnoise provably holds for linear networks and random feature models (RFMs) and\nis empirically verified for nonlinear networks. Moreover, the validity and\npractical relevance of our theoretical findings are justified by extensive\nnumerical experiments.",

These methods, however, struggle to scale to the high\nresolution of medical imaging datasets, where they are critical for achieving\ngood generalization on label-scarce medical image datasets. In this work, we\npropose the Histopathology DatasetGAN (HDGAN) framework, an extension of the\nDatasetGAN semi-supervised framework for image generation and segmentation that\nscales well to large-resolution histopathology images. We make several\nadaptations from the original framework, including updating the generative\nbackbone, selectively extracting latent features from the generator, and\nswitching to memory-mapped arrays. These changes reduce the memory consumption\nof the framework, improving its applicability to medical imaging domains. We\nevaluate HDGAN on a thrombotic microangiopathy high-resolution tile dataset,\ndemonstrating strong performance on the high-resolution image-annotation\ngeneration task. We hope that this work enables more application of deep\nlearning models to medical datasets, in addition to encouraging more\nexploration of self-supervised frameworks within the medical imaging domain.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel approach to embed flow-based models with\nhierarchical structures. The proposed framework is named Variational Flow\nGraphical (VFG) Model. VFGs learn the representation of high dimensional data\nvia a message-passing scheme by integrating flow-based functions through\nvariational inference. By leveraging the expressive power of neural networks,\nVFGs produce a representation of the data using a lower dimension, thus\novercoming the drawbacks of many flow-based models, usually requiring a high\ndimensional latent space involving many trivial variables. Aggregation nodes\nare introduced in the VFG models to integrate forward-backward hierarchical\ninformation via a message passing scheme. Maximizing the evidence lower bound\n(ELBO) of data likelihood aligns the forward and backward messages in each\naggregation node achieving a consistency node state. Algorithms have been\ndeveloped to learn model parameters through gradient updating regarding the\nELBO objective.\nThe consistency of aggregation nodes enable VFGs to be applicable in\ntractable inference on graphical structures. Besides representation learning\nand numerical inference, VFGs provide a new approach for distribution modeling\non datasets with graphical latent structures. Additionally, theoretical study\nshows that VFGs are universal approximators by leveraging the implicitly\ninvertible flow-based structures. With flexible graphical structures and\nsuperior excessive power, VFGs could potentially be used to improve\nprobabilistic inference. In the experiments, VFGs achieves improved evidence\nlower bound (ELBO) and likelihood values on multiple datasets.",

    "abstract": "The manifold hypothesis is a core mechanism behind the success of deep\nlearning, so understanding the intrinsic manifold structure of image data is\ncentral to studying how neural networks learn from the data. Intrinsic dataset\nmanifolds and their relationship to learning difficulty have recently begun to\nbe studied for the common domain of natural images, but little such research\nhas been attempted for radiological images. We address this here. First, we\ncompare the intrinsic manifold dimensionality of radiological and natural\nimages. We also investigate the relationship between intrinsic dimensionality\nand generalization ability over a wide range of datasets. Our analysis shows\nthat natural image datasets generally have a higher number of intrinsic\ndimensions than radiological images. However, the relationship between\ngeneralization ability and intrinsic dimensionality is much stronger for\nmedical images, which could be explained as radiological images having\nintrinsic features that are more difficult to learn. These results give a more\nprincipled underpinning for the intuition that radiological images can be more\nchallenging to apply deep learning to than natural image datasets common to\nmachine learning research. We believe rather than directly applying models\ndeveloped for natural images to the radiological imaging domain, more care\nshould be taken to developing architectures and algorithms that are more\ntailored to the specific characteristics of this domain. The research shown in\nour paper, demonstrating these characteristics and the differences from natural\nimages, is an important first step in this direction.",

In this way, we get\nadaptive prediction intervals that account for heteroscedasticity. However, the\naforementioned conformal step lacks adaptiveness as described in (Romano et\nal., 2019). To overcome this limitation, instead of applying a single conformal\nstep after estimating conditional quantiles with quantile regression, we\npropose to cluster the explanatory variables weighted by their permutation\nimportance with an optimized k-means and apply k conformal steps. To show that\nthis improved version outperforms the classic version of conformalized quantile\nregression and is more adaptive to heteroscedasticity, we extensively compare\nthe prediction intervals of both in open datasets.",

We extend the known regret bounds for\nsingle-level online algorithms to the bilevel setting.
