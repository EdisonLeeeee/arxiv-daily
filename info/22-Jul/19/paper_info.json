    "title": "Contrastive Brain Network Learning via Hierarchical Signed Graph Pooling  Model",
    "abstract": "Recently brain networks have been widely adopted to study brain dynamics,\nbrain development and brain diseases. Graph representation learning techniques\non brain functional networks can facilitate the discovery of novel biomarkers\nfor clinical phenotypes and neurodegenerative diseases. However, current graph\nlearning techniques have several issues on brain network mining. Firstly, most\ncurrent graph learning models are designed for unsigned graph, which hinders\nthe analysis of many signed network data (e.g., brain functional networks).\nMeanwhile, the insufficiency of brain network data limits the model performance\non clinical phenotypes predictions. Moreover, few of current graph learning\nmodel is interpretable, which may not be capable to provide biological insights\nfor model outcomes. Here, we propose an interpretable hierarchical signed graph\nrepresentation learning model to extract graph-level representations from brain\nfunctional networks, which can be used for different prediction tasks. In order\nto further improve the model performance, we also propose a new strategy to\naugment functional brain network data for contrastive learning. We evaluate\nthis framework on different classification and regression tasks using the data\nfrom HCP and OASIS. Our results from extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsuperiority of the proposed model compared to several state-of-the-art\ntechniques. Additionally, we use graph saliency maps, derived from these\nprediction tasks, to demonstrate detection and interpretation of phenotypic\nbiomarkers.",

    "abstract": "We characterise the classes of tournaments with tractable first-order model\nchecking. For every hereditary class of tournaments $\\mathcal T$, first-order\nmodel checking either is fixed parameter tractable, or is AW$[*]$-hard. This\ndichotomy coincides with the fact that $\\mathcal T$ has either bounded or\nunbounded twin-width, and that the growth of $\\mathcal T$ is either at most\nexponential or at least factorial. From the model-theoretic point of view, we\nshow that NIP classes of tournaments coincide with bounded twin-width.\nTwin-width is also characterised by three infinite families of obstructions:\n$\\mathcal T$ has bounded twin-width if and only if it excludes one tournament\nfrom each family. This generalises results of Bonnet et al. on ordered graphs.\nThe key for these results is a polynomial time algorithm which takes as input\na tournament $T$ and compute a linear order $<$ on $V(T)$ such that the\ntwin-width of the birelation $(T,<)$ is at most some function of the twin-width\nof $T$. Since approximating twin-width can be done in polynomial time for an\nordered structure $(T,<)$, this provides a polytime approximation of twin-width\nfor tournaments.\nOur results extend to oriented graphs with stable sets of bounded size, which\nmay also be augmented by arbitrary binary relations.",

Procedural models allow the creation of photorealistic materials\nwith parametric control for flexible editing of appearance.

Previous work [Hu et al. 2022; Shi et al. 2020]\nintroduced material graph optimization frameworks for matching target material\nsamples. However, these previous methods were limited to optimizing\ndifferentiable functions in the graphs.

    "abstract": "Using memory located on remote machines, or far memory, as a swap space is a\npromising approach to meet the increasing memory demands of modern datacenter\napplications. Operating systems have long relied on prefetchers to mask the\nincreased latency of fetching pages from swap space to main memory.\nUnfortunately, with traditional prefetching heuristics, performance still\ndegrades when applications use far memory. In this paper we propose a new\nprefetching technique for far-memory applications. We focus our efforts on\nmemory-intensive, oblivious applications whose memory access patterns are\nindependent of their inputs, such as matrix multiplication. For this class of\napplications we observe that we can perfectly prefetch pages without relying on\nheuristics. However, prefetching perfectly without requiring significant\napplication modifications is challenging.\nIn this paper we describe the design and implementation of 3PO, a system that\nprovides pre-planned prefetching for general oblivious applications. We\ndemonstrate that 3PO can accelerate applications, e.g., running them 30-150%\nfaster than with Linux's prefetcher with 20% local memory. We also use 3PO to\nunderstand the fundamental software overheads of prefetching in a paging-based\nsystem, and the minimum performance penalty that they impose when we run\napplications under constrained local memory.",

To\ncircumvent this issue, recent studies have focused on non-convex loss\nfunctions, such as the hard-margin loss, which associates a constant penalty to\nany misclassified or within-margin sample. Applying this loss function yields\nmuch-needed robustness for critical applications but it also leads to an\nNP-hard model that makes training difficult, since current exact optimization\nalgorithms show limited scalability, whereas heuristics are not able to find\nhigh-quality solutions consistently. Against this background, we propose new\ninteger programming strategies that significantly improve our ability to train\nthe hard-margin SVM model to global optimality. We introduce an iterative\nsampling and decomposition approach, in which smaller subproblems are used to\nseparate combinatorial Benders' cuts. Those cuts, used within a branch-and-cut\nalgorithm, permit to converge much more quickly towards a global optimum.\nThrough extensive numerical analyses on classical benchmark data sets, our\nsolution algorithm solves, for the first time, 117 new data sets to optimality\nand achieves a reduction of 50% in the average optimality gap for the hardest\ndatasets of the benchmark.",

This result is derived from\nthe following time-approximation trade-off: We establish an\n$O(1)^{2^q-1}$-approximation algorithm running in time $\\exp(O_q(n^{2^{-q}}))$,\nfor every integer $q \\geqslant 0$. Guided by the same framework, we obtain\nsimilar approximation algorithms for Min Coloring and Max Induced Matching. In\ngeneral graphs, all these problems are known to be highly inapproximable: for\nany $\\varepsilon > 0$, a polynomial-time $n^{1-\\varepsilon}$-approximation for\nany of them would imply that P$=$NP [Hastad, FOCS '96; Zuckerman, ToC '07;\nChalermsook et al., SODA '13]. We generalize the algorithms for Max Independent\nSet and Max Induced Matching to the independent (induced) packing of any fixed\nconnected graph $H$. In contrast, we show that such approximation guarantees on\ngraphs of bounded twin-width given with an $O(1)$-sequence are very unlikely\nfor Min Independent Dominating Set, and somewhat unlikely for Longest Path and\nLongest Induced Path. Regarding the existence of better approximation\nalgorithms, there is a (very) light evidence that the obtained approximation\nfactor of $n^\\varepsilon$ for Max Independent Set may be best possible. This is\nthe first in-depth study of the approximability of problems in graphs of\nbounded twin-width. Prior to this paper, essentially the only such result was\na~polynomial-time $O(1)$-approximation algorithm for Min Dominating Set [Bonnet\net al., ICALP '21].",

    "abstract": "We present a novel generative method for producing unseen and plausible\ncounterfactual examples for reinforcement learning (RL) agents based upon\noutcome variables that characterize agent behavior. Our approach uses a\nvariational autoencoder to train a latent space that jointly encodes\ninformation about the observations and outcome variables pertaining to an\nagent's behavior. Counterfactuals are generated using traversals in this latent\nspace, via gradient-driven updates as well as latent interpolations against\ncases drawn from a pool of examples. These include updates to raise the\nlikelihood of generated examples, which improves the plausibility of generated\ncounterfactuals. From experiments in three RL environments, we show that these\nmethods produce counterfactuals that are more plausible and proximal to their\nqueries compared to purely outcome-driven or case-based baselines. Finally, we\nshow that a latent jointly trained to reconstruct both the input observations\nand behavioral outcome variables produces higher-quality counterfactuals over\nlatents trained solely to reconstruct the observation inputs.",

    "abstract": "Touch is the primary way that users interact with smartphones. However,\nbuilding mobile user interfaces where touch interactions work well for all\nusers is a difficult problem, because users have different abilities and\npreferences. We propose a system, Reflow, which automatically applies small,\npersonalized UI adaptations, called refinements -- to mobile app screens to\nimprove touch efficiency. Reflow uses a pixel-based strategy to work with\nexisting applications, and improves touch efficiency while minimally disrupting\nthe design intent of the original application. Our system optimizes a UI by (i)\nextracting its layout from its screenshot, (ii) refining its layout, and (iii)\nre-rendering the UI to reflect these modifications. We conducted a user study\nwith 10 participants and a heuristic evaluation with 6 experts and found that\napplications optimized by Reflow led to, on average, 9% faster selection time\nwith minimal layout disruption. The results demonstrate that Reflow's\nrefinements useful UI adaptations to improve touch interactions.",

    "abstract": "An increased awareness concerning risks of algorithmic bias has driven a\nsurge of efforts around bias mitigation strategies. A vast majority of the\nproposed approaches fall under one of two categories: (1) imposing algorithmic\nfairness constraints on predictive models, and (2) collecting additional\ntraining samples. Most recently and at the intersection of these two\ncategories, methods that propose active learning under fairness constraints\nhave been developed. However, proposed bias mitigation strategies typically\noverlook the bias presented in the observed labels. In this work, we study\nfairness considerations of active data collection strategies in the presence of\nlabel bias. We first present an overview of different types of label bias in\nthe context of supervised learning systems. We then empirically show that, when\noverlooking label bias, collecting more data can aggravate bias, and imposing\nfairness constraints that rely on the observed labels in the data collection\nprocess may not address the problem. Our results illustrate the unintended\nconsequences of deploying a model that attempts to mitigate a single type of\nbias while neglecting others, emphasizing the importance of explicitly\ndifferentiating between the types of bias that fairness-aware algorithms aim to\naddress, and highlighting the risks of neglecting label bias during data\ncollection.",

    "abstract": "In the early twentieth century, many scholars focused on the preparation of\neditions and translations of texts previously available only to the few\nspecialists able to read archaic hands and privileged enough to travel to work\nin person with them in manuscript. Valuable scholarship in its own right, the\npreparation of these editions and translations for particular texts deemed\nimportant enough to justify the effort and time, laid the foundation for\ngenerations of scholarship in medieval studies. On the other hand, for many\nmaterials in historical archival collections, including already digitised\ncollections, medievalists have only had the time to create partial\ntranscriptions, if any at all. Access to textual material from the medieval\nperiod has increased greatly in recent years with digitisation, and we are able\nto imagine many new research projects in decades to come. What challenges do\nnew frontiers of automation in the archives raise with respect to medieval\nstudies and in particular to the ways we transcribe? In this article, we argue\nthat if medievalists hope to pursue the kinds of analysis that goes on in\nadvanced computational research, we will need new kinds of transcriptions,\nintentionally theorized not only for human reading, but also for machine\nprocessing. We already have mature methods for remediating generations of\neditions of medieval works such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR), but we\ncan ask ourselves if these are the kinds of text we want to use for future\ncomputational analysis.

We explore two optimizations that increase RL\ndata collection efficiency by increasing GPU utilization: (1) GPU\nvectorization: parallelizing simulation on the GPU for increased hardware\nparallelism, and (2) simulator kernel fusion: fusing multiple simulation steps\nto run in a single GPU kernel launch to reduce global memory bandwidth\nrequirements.

    "abstract": "Minimum redundancy among different elements of an embedding in a latent space\nis a fundamental requirement or major preference in representation learning to\ncapture intrinsic informational structures. Current self-supervised learning\nmethods minimize a pair-wise covariance matrix to reduce the feature redundancy\nand produce promising results. However, such representation features of\nmultiple variables may contain the redundancy among more than two feature\nvariables that cannot be minimized via the pairwise regularization. Here we\npropose the High-Order Mixed-Moment-based Embedding (HOME) strategy to reduce\nthe redundancy between any sets of feature variables, which is to our best\nknowledge the first attempt to utilize high-order statistics/information in\nthis context. Multivariate mutual information is minimum if and only if\nmultiple variables are mutually independent, which suggests the necessary\nconditions of factorized mixed moments among multiple variables. Based on these\nstatistical and information theoretic principles, our general HOME framework is\npresented for self-supervised representation learning. Our initial experiments\nshow that a simple version in the form of a three-order HOME scheme already\nsignificantly outperforms the current two-order baseline method (i.e., Barlow\nTwins) in terms of the linear evaluation on representation features.",

    "abstract": "Although spatial index structures shorten the query response time, they rely\non complex tree structures to narrow down the search space. Such structures in\nturn yield additional storage overhead and take a toll on index maintenance.\nRecently, there has been a flurry on works attempting to leverage\nmachine-Learning(ML) models to simplify the index structures. Some follow-up\nworks extend the idea to support geospatial point data. These approaches\npartition the multidimensional space to cells and assign IDs to these cells\nusing space-filling curve(e.g., Z-order curve) or mathematical equations. These\napproaches work well for geospatial points but are not able to handle complex\ngeometries such as polygons and trajectories which are widely available in\ngeospatial data.\nThis paper introduces GLIN, a lightweight learned index for spatial range\nqueries on complex geometries. To achieve that, GLIN transforms geometries to\nZ-address intervals, and builds a hierarchical model to learn the cumulative\ndistribution function between these intervals and the record positions. The\nlightweight hierarchical model greatly shortens the index probing time.\nFurthermore, GLIN augments spatial query windows using an add-on function to\nguarantee the query accuracy for both Contains and Intersects spatial\nrelationships. Our experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets show that\nGLIN occupies 40-70 times less storage overhead than popular spatial indexes\nsuch as Quad-Tree while still showing similar query response time in medium\nselectivity queries. Moreover, GLIN's maintenance speed is around 1.5 times\nhigher on insertion and 3-5 times higher on deletion.",

This approach is fitting for binary transmission over additive white\nGaussian noise channels. This letter considers transmission of coded and\nmodulated data over flat fading channels and proposes a variant of GRAND, which\nleverages information on the modulation scheme and the fading channel.

Manually generating a fair consensus ranking is time-consuming\nand impractical -- even for a fairly small number of candidates. While\nalgorithmic approaches for auditing and generating fair consensus rankings have\nbeen developed recently, these have not been operationalized in interactive\nsystems. To bridge this gap, we introduce FairFuse, a visualization-enabled\ntool for generating, analyzing, and auditing fair consensus rankings. In\ndeveloping FairFuse, we construct a data model which includes several base\nrankings entered by rankers, augmented with measures of group fairness,\nalgorithms for generating consensus rankings with varying degrees of fairness,\nand other fairness and rank-related capabilities. We design novel\nvisualizations that encode these measures in a parallel-coordinates style rank\nvisualization, with interactive capabilities for generating and exploring fair\nconsensus rankings. We provide case studies in which FairFuse supports a\ndecision-maker in ranking scenarios in which fairness is important. Finally, we\ndiscuss emerging challenges for future efforts supporting fairness-oriented\nrank analysis; including handling intersectionality, defined by multiple\nprotected attributes, and the need for user studies targeting peoples'\nperceptions and use of fairness oriented visualization systems.

    "abstract": "One of the essential requirements of the Industrial Internet of Things\n(IIoT), is to have an extremely high packet delivery rate, generally over\n99.9\\%. However, packets which arrive after a predefined deadline shall be\nconsidered lost too. Industrial applications require a predictable delay. To\nsolve this problem, we propose a new mechanism, called BDPC (Bounded Delay\nPacket Control). BDPC combines the knowledge of a node's delay to its root with\nthe time budget of a data packet traversing the IoT network, to allocate cells\nin 6TiSCH slotFrames in order to fulfill the application's maximum delay\nrequirements in a controlled manner: the application packets must arrive before\nthe deadline, but not faster. This is achieved by allocating cells from a\nparent node to a child node, thereby adapting the cell capacity and attaining\nthe bounded delay goal, by the analysis of the new variable $latePaqs$. In\nother words, the resource allocation is a function of $latePaqs$. Moreover, the\nnumber of packets arriving after the predefined deadline can be controlled by\ntwo thresholds: sfMax and sfMin. Our results show that using BDPC, the number\nof packets arriving before the deadline can be improved more than 2.6 times\ncompared to the case when using the default Minimal Scheduling Function from\nthe standard. As a further advantage, BDPC involves minor modifications to the\n6TiSCH protocol stack, which makes it compatible with current implementations.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning has emerged as a privacy-preserving machine learning\napproach where multiple parties can train a single model without sharing their\nraw training data. Federated learning typically requires the utilization of\nmulti-party computation techniques to provide strong privacy guarantees by\nensuring that an untrusted or curious aggregator cannot obtain isolated replies\nfrom parties involved in the training process, thereby preventing potential\ninference attacks. Until recently, it was thought that some of these secure\naggregation techniques were sufficient to fully protect against inference\nattacks coming from a curious aggregator. However, recent research has\ndemonstrated that a curious aggregator can successfully launch a disaggregation\nattack to learn information about model updates of a target party. This paper\npresents DeTrust-FL, an efficient privacy-preserving federated learning\nframework for addressing the lack of transparency that enables isolation\nattacks, such as disaggregation attacks, during secure aggregation by assuring\nthat parties' model updates are included in the aggregated model in a private\nand secure manner. DeTrust-FL proposes a decentralized trust consensus\nmechanism and incorporates a recently proposed decentralized functional\nencryption (FE) scheme in which all parties agree on a participation matrix\nbefore collaboratively generating decryption key fragments, thereby gaining\ncontrol and trust over the secure aggregation process in a decentralized\nsetting. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that DeTrust-FL outperforms\nstate-of-the-art FE-based secure multi-party aggregation solutions in terms of\ntraining time and reduces the volume of data transferred.

In our application, the mobile app aims to boost customer\nretention by sending cash bonuses to customers and control the costs of such\ncash bonuses during each time period. To achieve the multi-task goal, we\npropose the Budget Constrained Reinforcement Learning for Sequential Promotion\n(BCRLSP) framework to determine the value of cash bonuses to be sent to users.\nWe first find out the target policy and the associated Q-values that maximizes\nthe user retention rate using an RL model. A linear programming (LP) model is\nthen added to satisfy the constraints of promotion costs. We solve the LP\nproblem by maximizing the Q-values of actions learned from the RL model given\nthe budget constraints. During deployment, we combine the offline RL model with\nthe LP model to generate a robust policy under the budget constraints. Using\nboth online and offline experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of our\napproach by showing that BCRLSP achieves a higher long-term customer retention\nrate and a lower cost than various baselines. Taking advantage of the near\nreal-time cost control method, the proposed framework can easily adapt to data\nwith a noisy behavioral policy and/or meet flexible budget constraints.",

    "abstract": "Experience replay is an essential component in deep reinforcement learning\n(DRL), which stores the experiences and generates experiences for the agent to\nlearn in real time. Recently, prioritized experience replay (PER) has been\nproven to be powerful and widely deployed in DRL agents. However, implementing\nPER on traditional CPU or GPU architectures incurs significant latency overhead\ndue to its frequent and irregular memory accesses. This paper proposes a\nhardware-software co-design approach to design an associative memory (AM) based\nPER, AMPER, with an AM-friendly priority sampling operation. AMPER replaces the\nwidely-used time-costly tree-traversal-based priority sampling in PER while\npreserving the learning performance. Further, we design an in-memory computing\nhardware architecture based on AM to support AMPER by leveraging parallel\nin-memory search operations. AMPER shows comparable learning performance while\nachieving 55x to 270x latency improvement when running on the proposed hardware\ncompared to the state-of-the-art PER running on GPU.",

    "abstract": "Adversarial training, as one of the most effective defense methods against\nadversarial attacks, tends to learn an inclusive decision boundary to increase\nthe robustness of deep learning models. However, due to the large and\nunnecessary increase in the margin along adversarial directions, adversarial\ntraining causes heavy cross-over between natural examples and adversarial\nexamples, which is not conducive to balancing the trade-off between robustness\nand natural accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial training\nscheme to achieve a better trade-off between robustness and natural accuracy.\nIt aims to learn a moderate-inclusive decision boundary, which means that the\nmargins of natural examples under the decision boundary are moderate. We call\nthis scheme Moderate-Margin Adversarial Training (MMAT), which generates\nfiner-grained adversarial examples to mitigate the cross-over problem. We also\ntake advantage of logits from a teacher model that has been well-trained to\nguide the learning of our model.

    "abstract": "Constructing high-quality character image datasets is challenging because\nreal-world images are often affected by image degradation. There are\nlimitations when applying current image restoration methods to such real-world\ncharacter images, since (i) the categories of noise in character images are\ndifferent from those in general images; (ii) real-world character images\nusually contain more complex image degradation, e.g., mixed noise at different\nnoise levels. To address these problems, we propose a real-world character\nrestoration network (RCRN) to effectively restore degraded character images,\nwhere character skeleton information and scale-ensemble feature extraction are\nutilized to obtain better restoration performance. The proposed method consists\nof a skeleton extractor (SENet) and a character image restorer (CiRNet). SENet\naims to preserve the structural consistency of the character and normalize\ncomplex noise. Then, CiRNet reconstructs clean images from degraded character\nimages and their skeletons. Due to the lack of benchmarks for real-world\ncharacter image restoration, we constructed a dataset containing 1,606\ncharacter images with real-world degradation to evaluate the validity of the\nproposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that RCRN outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively.",

    "abstract": "Degraded images commonly exist in the general sources of character images,\nleading to unsatisfactory character recognition results. Existing methods have\ndedicated efforts to restoring degraded character images. However, the\ndenoising results obtained by these methods do not appear to improve character\nrecognition performance.

In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel generic framework based on glyph fusion and\nattention mechanisms, i.e., CharFormer, for precisely recovering character\nimages without changing their inherent glyphs. Unlike existing frameworks,\nCharFormer introduces a parallel target task for capturing additional\ninformation and injecting it into the image denoising backbone, which will\nmaintain the consistency of character glyphs during character image denoising.\nMoreover, we utilize attention-based networks for global-local feature\ninteraction, which will help to deal with blind denoising and enhance denoising\nperformance.

    "abstract": "Text-to-image person re-identification (ReID) aims to search for pedestrian\nimages of an interested identity via textual descriptions. It is challenging\ndue to both rich intra-modal variations and significant inter-modal gaps.\nExisting works usually ignore the difference in feature granularity between the\ntwo modalities, i.e., the visual features are usually fine-grained while\ntextual features are coarse, which is mainly responsible for the large\ninter-modal gaps. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end framework based on\ntransformers to learn granularity-unified representations for both modalities,\ndenoted as LGUR. LGUR framework contains two modules: a Dictionary-based\nGranularity Alignment (DGA) module and a Prototype-based Granularity\nUnification (PGU) module. In DGA, in order to align the granularities of two\nmodalities, we introduce a Multi-modality Shared Dictionary (MSD) to\nreconstruct both visual and textual features. Besides, DGA has two important\nfactors, i.e., the cross-modality guidance and the foreground-centric\nreconstruction, to facilitate the optimization of MSD. In PGU, we adopt a set\nof shared and learnable prototypes as the queries to extract diverse and\nsemantically aligned features for both modalities in the granularity-unified\nfeature space, which further promotes the ReID performance.

To perform a prior dimensionality reduction, a set\nof reduced basis (RB) functions are extracted from the database via a two-step\nproper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method. Projection coefficients of the\nreduced basis functions are further compressed through a convolutional\nautoencoder (CAE) network.

    "title": "On Scheduling Ring-All-Reduce Learning Jobs in Multi-Tenant GPU Clusters  with Communication Contention",
    "abstract": "Powered by advances in deep learning (DL) techniques, machine learning and\nartificial intelligence have achieved astonishing successes. However, the\nrapidly growing needs for DL also led to communication- and resource-intensive\ndistributed training jobs for large-scale DL training, which are typically\ndeployed over GPU clusters. To sustain the ever-increasing demand for DL\ntraining, the so-called \"ring-all-reduce\" (RAR) technologies have recently\nemerged as a favorable computing architecture to efficiently process network\ncommunication and computation load in GPU clusters. The most salient feature of\nRAR is that it removes the need for dedicated parameter servers, thus\nalleviating the potential communication bottleneck. However, when multiple\nRAR-based DL training jobs are deployed over GPU clusters, communication\nbottlenecks could still occur due to contentions between DL training jobs. So\nfar, there remains a lack of theoretical understanding on how to design\ncontention-aware resource scheduling algorithms for RAR-based DL training jobs,\nwhich motivates us to fill this gap in this work. Our main contributions are\nthree-fold: i) We develop a new analytical model that characterizes both\ncommunication overhead related to the worker distribution of the job and\ncommunication contention related to the co-location of different jobs; ii)\nBased on the proposed analytical model, we formulate the problem as a\nnon-convex integer program to minimize the makespan of all RAR-based DL\ntraining jobs. To address the unique structure in this problem that is not\namenable for optimization algorithm design, we reformulate the problem into an\ninteger linear program that enables provable approximation algorithm design\ncalled SJF-BCO (Smallest Job First with Balanced Contention and Overhead); and\niii) We conduct extensive experiments to show the superiority of SJF-BCO over\nexisting schedulers.",

    "title": "Bagging Regional Classification Activation Maps for Weakly Supervised  Object Localization",
    "abstract": "Classification activation map (CAM), utilizing the classification structure\nto generate pixel-wise localization maps, is a crucial mechanism for weakly\nsupervised object localization (WSOL). However, CAM directly uses the\nclassifier trained on image-level features to locate objects, making it prefers\nto discern global discriminative factors rather than regional object cues. Thus\nonly the discriminative locations are activated when feeding pixel-level\nfeatures into this classifier. To solve this issue, this paper elaborates a\nplug-and-play mechanism called BagCAMs to better project a well-trained\nclassifier for the localization task without refining or re-training the\nbaseline structure. Our BagCAMs adopts a proposed regional localizer generation\n(RLG) strategy to define a set of regional localizers and then derive them from\na well-trained classifier. These regional localizers can be viewed as the base\nlearner that only discerns region-wise object factors for localization tasks,\nand their results can be effectively weighted by our BagCAMs to form the final\nlocalization map. Experiments indicate that adopting our proposed BagCAMs can\nimprove the performance of baseline WSOL methods to a great extent and obtains\nstate-of-the-art performance on three WSOL benchmarks.

    "abstract": "We introduce data structures for solving robust regression through stochastic\ngradient descent (SGD) by sampling gradients with probability proportional to\ntheir norm, i.e., importance sampling. Although SGD is widely used for large\nscale machine learning, it is well-known for possibly experiencing slow\nconvergence rates due to the high variance from uniform sampling. On the other\nhand, importance sampling can significantly decrease the variance but is\nusually difficult to implement because computing the sampling probabilities\nrequires additional passes over the data, in which case standard gradient\ndescent (GD) could be used instead. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm\nthat approximately samples $T$ gradients of dimension $d$ from nearly the\noptimal importance sampling distribution for a robust regression problem over\n$n$ rows. Thus our algorithm effectively runs $T$ steps of SGD with importance\nsampling while using sublinear space and just making a single pass over the\ndata. Our techniques also extend to performing importance sampling for\nsecond-order optimization.",

    "abstract": "Among many solutions to the high-dimensional approximate nearest neighbor\n(ANN) search problem, locality sensitive hashing (LSH) is known for its\nsub-linear query time and robust theoretical guarantee on query accuracy.\nTraditional LSH methods can generate a small number of candidates quickly from\nhash tables but suffer from large index sizes and hash boundary problems.\nRecent studies to address these issues often incur extra overhead to identify\neligible candidates or remove false positives, making query time no longer\nsub-linear. To address this dilemma, in this paper we propose a novel LSH\nscheme called DB-LSH which supports efficient ANN search for large\nhigh-dimensional datasets. It organizes the projected spaces with\nmulti-dimensional indexes rather than using fixed-width hash buckets. Our\napproach can significantly reduce the space cost as by avoiding the need to\nmaintain many hash tables for different bucket sizes. During the query phase of\nDB-LSH, a small number of high-quality candidates can be generated efficiently\nby dynamically constructing query-based hypercubic buckets with the required\nwidths through index-based window queries. For a dataset of $n$ $d$-dimensional\npoints with approximation ratio $c$, our rigorous theoretical analysis shows\nthat DB-LSH achieves a smaller query cost ${O(n^{\\rho^*} d\\log n)}$, where\n${\\rho^*}$ is bounded by ${1/c^{\\alpha}}$ while the bound is ${1/c}$ in the\nexisting work. An extensive range of experiments on real-world data\ndemonstrates the superiority of DB-LSH over state-of-the-art methods on both\nefficiency and accuracy.",

    "abstract": "In reinforcement learning, agents have successfully used environments modeled\nwith Markov decision processes (MDPs). However, in many problem domains, an\nagent may suffer from noisy observations or random times until its subsequent\ndecision. While partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) have\ndealt with noisy observations, they have yet to deal with the unknown time\naspect. Of course, one could discretize the time, but this leads to Bellman's\nCurse of Dimensionality. To incorporate continuous sojourn-time distributions\nin the agent's decision making, we propose that partially observable\nsemi-Markov decision processes (POSMDPs) can be helpful in this regard. We\nextend \\citet{Spaan2005a} randomized point-based value iteration (PBVI)\n\\textsc{Perseus} algorithm used for POMDP to POSMDP by incorporating continuous\nsojourn time distributions and using importance sampling to reduce the solver\ncomplexity.

This further allows for compressed complex\nPOMDPs requiring temporal state information by moving this information into\nstate sojourn time of a POMSDP. The second insight is that keeping a set of\nsampled times and weighting it by its likelihood can be used in a single\nbackup; this helps further reduce the algorithm complexity.

In this\npaper, we consider the domain shift problem in FSL and aim to address the\ndomain gap between the support set and the query set. Different from previous\ncross-domain FSL work (CD-FSL) that considers the domain shift between base and\nnovel classes, the new problem, termed cross-domain cross-set FSL (CDSC-FSL),\nrequires few-shot learners not only to adapt to the new domain, but also to be\nconsistent between different domains within each novel class.

Unlike traditional timer-series forecasting tasks,\nM-LSTF tasks are more challenging from two aspects: 1) M-LSTF models need to\nlearn time-series patterns both within and between multiple time features; 2)\nUnder the rolling forecasting setting, the similarity between two consecutive\ntraining samples increases with the increasing prediction length, which makes\nmodels more prone to overfitting.

    "abstract": "We present experimental and theoretical results on a method that applies a\nnumerical solver iteratively to solve several non-negative quadratic\nprogramming problems in geometric optimization. The method gains efficiency by\nexploiting the potential sparsity of the intermediate solutions. We implemented\nthe method to call quadprog of MATLAB iteratively. In comparison with a single\ncall of quadprog, we obtain a 10-fold speedup on two proximity graph problems\nin $\\mathbb{R}^d$ on some public data sets, a 10-fold speedup on the minimum\nenclosing ball problem on random points in a unit cube in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, and a\n5-fold speedup on the polytope distance problem on random points from a cube in\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$ when the input size is significantly larger than the dimension;\nwe also obtain a 2-fold or more speedup on deblurring some gray-scale space and\nthermal images via non-negative least square. We compare with two minimum\nenclosing ball software by G\\\"{a}rtner and Fischer et al.; for 1000 nearly\ncospherical points or random points in a unit cube, the iterative method\novertakes the software by G\\\"{a}rtner at 20 dimensions and the software by\nFischer et al. at 170 dimensions. In the image deblurring experiments, the\niterative method compares favorably with other software that can solve\nnon-negative least square, including FISTA with backtracking, SBB, FNNLS, and\nlsqnonneg of MATLAB. We analyze theoretically the number of iterations taken by\nthe iterative scheme to reduce the gap between the current solution value and\nthe optimum by a factor $e$. Under certain assumptions, we prove a bound\nproportional to the square root of the number of variables.",

However, they are not easy\nto use for real-world applications due to the implementation complications.\nMultigrid (MG) methods, on the contrary, are computationally efficient but lack\nof theoretical justifications. To bridge the gap between theory and practice,\nwe adopt ideas of MG and SS methods and proposed preconditioners that can be\nused in practice with theoretical guarantees. We expand the original graph\nbased on a multilevel structure to obtain an equivalent expanded graph.\nAlthough the expanded graph has a low diameter, a favorable property for\nconstructing SSs, it has negatively weighted edges, which is an unfavorable\nproperty for the SSs. We design an algorithm to properly eliminate the\nnegatively weighted edges and prove that the resulting expanded graph with\npositively weighted edges is spectrally equivalent to the expanded graph, thus,\nthe original graph. Due to the low-diameter property of the positively-weighted\nexpanded graph preconditioner (PEGP), existing algorithms for finding SSs can\nbe easily applied.

    "abstract": "Recently many plug-and-play self-attention modules (SAMs) are proposed to\nenhance the model generalization by exploiting the internal information of deep\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs). In general, previous works ignore where\nto plug in the SAMs since they connect the SAMs individually with each block of\nthe entire CNN backbone for granted, leading to incremental computational cost\nand the number of parameters with the growth of network depth. However, we\nempirically find and verify some counterintuitive phenomena that: (a)\nConnecting the SAMs to all the blocks may not always bring the largest\nperformance boost, and connecting to partial blocks would be even better; (b)\nAdding the SAMs to a CNN may not always bring a performance boost, and instead\nit may even harm the performance of the original CNN backbone. Therefore, we\narticulate and demonstrate the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis for Self-attention\nNetworks: a full self-attention network contains a subnetwork with sparse\nself-attention connections that can (1) accelerate inference, (2) reduce extra\nparameter increment, and (3) maintain accuracy. In addition to the empirical\nevidence, this hypothesis is also supported by our theoretical evidence.\nFurthermore, we propose a simple yet effective reinforcement-learning-based\nmethod to search the ticket, i.e., the connection scheme that satisfies the\nthree above-mentioned conditions. Extensive experiments on widely-used\nbenchmark datasets and popular self-attention networks show the effectiveness\nof our method. Besides, our experiments illustrate that our searched ticket has\nthe capacity of transferring to some vision tasks, e.g., crowd counting and\nsegmentation.",

The accelerator-in-memory (AiM) architectures are a\npromising solution to efficiently accelerate DNNs as they can avoid the memory\nbottleneck of the traditional von Neumann architecture. As the main memory is\nusually DRAM in many systems, a highly parallel multiply-accumulate (MAC) array\nwithin the DRAM can maximize the benefit of AiM by reducing both the distance\nand amount of data movement between the processor and the main memory. This\npaper presents an analog MAC array based AiM architecture named MAC-DO. In\ncontrast with previous in-DRAM accelerators, MAC-DO makes an entire DRAM array\nparticipate in MAC computations simultaneously without idle cells, leading to\nhigher throughput and energy efficiency. This improvement is made possible by\nexploiting a new analog computation method based on charge steering. In\naddition, MAC-DO innately supports multi-bit MACs with good linearity. MAC-DO\nis still compatible with current 1T1C DRAM technology without any modifications\nof a DRAM cell and array. A MAC-DO array can accelerate matrix multiplications\nbased on output stationary mapping and thus supports most of the computations\nperformed in DNNs.

    "abstract": "One-shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has been widely used to discover\narchitectures due to its efficiency. However, previous studies reveal that\none-shot performance estimations of architectures might not be well correlated\nwith their performances in stand-alone training because of the excessive\nsharing of operation parameters (i.e., large sharing extent) between\narchitectures. Thus, recent methods construct even more over-parameterized\nsupernets to reduce the sharing extent. But these improved methods introduce a\nlarge number of extra parameters and thus cause an undesirable trade-off\nbetween the training costs and the ranking quality. To alleviate the above\nissues, we propose to apply Curriculum Learning On Sharing Extent (CLOSE) to\ntrain the supernet both efficiently and effectively. Specifically, we train the\nsupernet with a large sharing extent (an easier curriculum) at the beginning\nand gradually decrease the sharing extent of the supernet (a harder\ncurriculum). To support this training strategy, we design a novel supernet\n(CLOSENet) that decouples the parameters from operations to realize a flexible\nsharing scheme and adjustable sharing extent. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat CLOSE can obtain a better ranking quality across different computational\nbudget constraints than other one-shot supernets, and is able to discover\nsuperior architectures when combined with various search strategies.

    "abstract": "Since RANSAC, a great deal of research has been devoted to improving both its\naccuracy and run-time. Still, only a few methods aim at recognizing invalid\nminimal samples early, before the often expensive model estimation and quality\ncalculation are done. To this end, we propose NeFSAC, an efficient algorithm\nfor neural filtering of motion-inconsistent and poorly-conditioned minimal\nsamples. We train NeFSAC to predict the probability of a minimal sample leading\nto an accurate relative pose, only based on the pixel coordinates of the image\ncorrespondences. Our neural filtering model learns typical motion patterns of\nsamples which lead to unstable poses, and regularities in the possible motions\nto favour well-conditioned and likely-correct samples. The novel lightweight\narchitecture implements the main invariants of minimal samples for pose\nestimation, and a novel training scheme addresses the problem of extreme class\nimbalance. NeFSAC can be plugged into any existing RANSAC-based pipeline. We\nintegrate it into USAC and show that it consistently provides strong speed-ups\neven under extreme train-test domain gaps - for example, the model trained for\nthe autonomous driving scenario works on PhotoTourism too. We tested NeFSAC on\nmore than 100k image pairs from three publicly available real-world datasets\nand found that it leads to one order of magnitude speed-up, while often finding\nmore accurate results than USAC alone.

    "title": "Model-Aware Contrastive Learning: Towards Escaping Uniformity-Tolerance  Dilemma in Training",
    "abstract": "Instance discrimination contrastive learning (CL) has achieved significant\nsuccess in learning transferable representations. A hardness-aware property\nrelated to the temperature $ \\tau $ of the CL loss is identified to play an\nessential role in automatically concentrating on hard negative samples.\nHowever, previous work also proves that there exists a uniformity-tolerance\ndilemma (UTD) in CL loss, which will lead to unexpected performance\ndegradation. Specifically, a smaller temperature helps to learn separable\nembeddings but has less tolerance to semantically related samples, which may\nresult in suboptimal embedding space, and vice versa. In this paper, we propose\na Model-Aware Contrastive Learning (MACL) strategy to escape UTD. For the\nundertrained phases, there is less possibility that the high similarity region\nof the anchor contains latent positive samples. Thus, adopting a small\ntemperature in these stages can impose larger penalty strength on hard negative\nsamples to improve the discrimination of the CL model. In contrast, a larger\ntemperature in the well-trained phases helps to explore semantic structures due\nto more tolerance to potential positive samples. During implementation, the\ntemperature in MACL is designed to be adaptive to the alignment property that\nreflects the confidence of a CL model. Furthermore, we reexamine why\ncontrastive learning requires a large number of negative samples in a unified\ngradient reduction perspective. Based on MACL and these analyses, a new CL loss\nis proposed in this work to improve the learned representations and training\nwith small batch size.",

However, the rapid pace of advancements in this area comes at\na price: training pipelines vary significantly across papers, which presents a\npotentially crucial confounding factor. Here, we show that, indeed, the choice\nof hyperparameters and data augmentation strategies can have a dramatic impact\non performance. To shed light on these neglected factors and help maximize the\npower of SSL, we hyperparameterize these components and optimize them with\nBayesian optimization, showing improvements across multiple datasets for the\nSimSiam SSL approach. Realizing the importance of data augmentations for SSL,\nwe also introduce a new automated data augmentation algorithm, GroupAugment,\nwhich considers groups of augmentations and optimizes the sampling across\ngroups. In contrast to algorithms designed for supervised learning,\nGroupAugment achieved consistently high linear evaluation accuracy across all\ndatasets we considered.

    "abstract": "Nonlinear systems of affine control inputs overarch many sensor fusion\ninstances. Analyzing whether a state variable in such a nonlinear system can be\nestimated (i.e., observability) informs better estimator design. Among the\nresearch on local observability of nonlinear systems, approaches based on\ndifferential geometry have attracted much attention for the solid theoretic\nfoundation and suitability to automated deduction. Such approaches usually work\nwith a system model of unconstrained control inputs and assume that the control\ninputs and observation outputs are timestamped by the same clock. To our\nknowledge, it has not been shown how to conduct the observability analysis with\nadditional constraints enforced on the system's observations or control inputs.\nTo this end, we propose procedures to convert a system model of affine control\ninputs with linear constraints into a constraint-free standard model which is\napt to be analyzed by the classic observability analysis procedure. Then, the\nwhole analysis procedure is illustrated by applying to the well-studied visual\ninertial odometry (VIO) system which estimates the camera-IMU relative pose and\ntime offset. The findings about unobservable variables under degenerate motion\nconcur with those obtained with linearized VIO systems in other studies,\nwhereas the findings about observability of time offset extend those in\nprevious studies.

    "abstract": "The order/dimension of models derived on the basis of data is commonly\nrestricted by the number of observations, or in the context of monitored\nsystems, sensing nodes. This is particularly true for structural systems (e.g.\ncivil or mechanical structures), which are typically high-dimensional in\nnature. In the scope of physics-informed machine learning, this paper proposes\na framework - termed Neural Modal ODEs - to integrate physics-based modeling\nwith deep learning (particularly, Neural Ordinary Differential Equations --\nNeural ODEs) for modeling the dynamics of monitored and high-dimensional\nengineered systems. In this initiating exploration, we restrict ourselves to\nlinear or mildly nonlinear systems. We propose an architecture that couples a\ndynamic version of variational autoencoders with physics-informed Neural ODEs\n(Pi-Neural ODEs). An encoder, as a part of the autoencoder, learns the abstract\nmappings from the first few items of observational data to the initial values\nof the latent variables, which drive the learning of embedded dynamics via\nphysics-informed Neural ODEs, imposing a \\textit{modal model} structure to that\nlatent space. The decoder of the proposed model adopts the eigenmodes derived\nfrom an eigen-analysis applied to the linearized portion of a physics-based\nmodel: a process implicitly carrying the spatial relationship between\ndegrees-of-freedom (DOFs). The framework is validated on a numerical example,\nand an experimental dataset of a scaled cable-stayed bridge, where the learned\nhybrid model is shown to outperform a purely physics-based approach to\nmodeling. We further show the functionality of the proposed scheme within the\ncontext of virtual sensing, i.e., the recovery of generalized response\nquantities in unmeasured DOFs from spatially sparse data.",

As a result, processor-centric systems (e.g., CPU, GPU)\nsuffer from costly data movement between memory units and processing units,\nwhich consumes large amounts of energy and execution cycles. Memory-centric\ncomputing systems, i.e., with processing-in-memory (PIM) capabilities, can\nalleviate this data movement bottleneck.\nOur goal is to understand the potential of modern general-purpose PIM\narchitectures to accelerate ML training. To do so, we (1) implement several\nrepresentative classic ML algorithms (namely, linear regression, logistic\nregression, decision tree, K-Means clustering) on a real-world general-purpose\nPIM architecture, (2) rigorously evaluate and characterize them in terms of\naccuracy, performance and scaling, and (3) compare to their counterpart\nimplementations on CPU and GPU. Our evaluation on a real memory-centric\ncomputing system with more than 2500 PIM cores shows that general-purpose PIM\narchitectures can greatly accelerate memory-bound ML workloads, when the\nnecessary operations and datatypes are natively supported by PIM hardware. For\nexample, our PIM implementation of decision tree is $27\\times$ faster than a\nstate-of-the-art CPU version on an 8-core Intel Xeon, and $1.34\\times$ faster\nthan a state-of-the-art GPU version on an NVIDIA A100. Our K-Means clustering\non PIM is $2.8\\times$ and $3.2\\times$ than state-of-the-art CPU and GPU\nversions, respectively.\nTo our knowledge, our work is the first one to evaluate ML training on a\nreal-world PIM architecture. We conclude with key observations, takeaways, and\nrecommendations that can inspire users of ML workloads, programmers of PIM\narchitectures, and hardware designers & architects of future memory-centric\ncomputing systems.",

    "abstract": "In the past few years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the de facto\nmodel of choice for graph classification. While, from the theoretical\nviewpoint, most GNNs can operate on graphs of any size, it is empirically\nobserved that their classification performance degrades when they are applied\non graphs with sizes that differ from those in the training data. Previous\nworks have tried to tackle this issue in graph classification by providing the\nmodel with inductive biases derived from assumptions on the generative process\nof the graphs, or by requiring access to graphs from the test domain. The first\nstrategy is tied to the use of ad-hoc models and to the quality of the\nassumptions made on the generative process, leaving open the question of how to\nimprove the performance of generic GNN models in general settings. On the other\nhand, the second strategy can be applied to any GNN, but requires access to\ninformation that is not always easy to obtain. In this work we consider the\nscenario in which we only have access to the training data, and we propose a\nregularization strategy that can be applied to any GNN to improve its\ngeneralization capabilities from smaller to larger graphs without requiring\naccess to the test data. Our regularization is based on the idea of simulating\na shift in the size of the training graphs using coarsening techniques, and\nenforcing the model to be robust to such a shift. Experimental results on\nstandard datasets show that popular GNN models, trained on the 50% smallest\ngraphs in the dataset and tested on the 10% largest graphs, obtain performance\nimprovements of up to 30% when trained with our regularization strategy.",

    "abstract": "Feature pyramid network (FPN) is one of the key components for object\ndetectors. However, there is a long-standing puzzle for researchers that the\ndetection performance of large-scale objects are usually suppressed after\nintroducing FPN. To this end, this paper first revisits FPN in the detection\nframework and reveals the nature of the success of FPN from the perspective of\noptimization. Then, we point out that the degraded performance of large-scale\nobjects is due to the arising of improper back-propagation paths after\nintegrating FPN. It makes each level of the backbone network only has the\nability to look at the objects within a certain scale range. Based on these\nanalysis, two feasible strategies are proposed to enable each level of the\nbackbone to look at all objects in the FPN-based detection frameworks.\nSpecifically, one is to introduce auxiliary objective functions to make each\nbackbone level directly receive the back-propagation signals of various-scale\nobjects during training. The other is to construct the feature pyramid in a\nmore reasonable way to avoid the irrational back-propagation paths. Extensive\nexperiments on the COCO benchmark validate the soundness of our analysis and\nthe effectiveness of our methods.

    "abstract": "Depth estimation, visual odometry (VO), and bird's-eye-view (BEV) scene\nlayout estimation present three critical tasks for driving scene perception,\nwhich is fundamental for motion planning and navigation in autonomous driving.\nThough they are complementary to each other, prior works usually focus on each\nindividual task and rarely deal with all three tasks together. A naive way is\nto accomplish them independently in a sequential or parallel manner, but there\nare many drawbacks, i.e., 1) the depth and VO results suffer from the inherent\nscale ambiguity issue; 2) the BEV layout is directly predicted from the\nfront-view image without using any depth-related information, although the\ndepth map contains useful geometry clues for inferring scene layouts. In this\npaper, we address these issues by proposing a novel joint perception framework\nnamed JPerceiver, which can simultaneously estimate scale-aware depth and VO as\nwell as BEV layout from a monocular video sequence. It exploits the cross-view\ngeometric transformation (CGT) to propagate the absolute scale from the road\nlayout to depth and VO based on a carefully-designed scale loss. Meanwhile, a\ncross-view and cross-modal transfer (CCT) module is devised to leverage the\ndepth clues for reasoning road and vehicle layout through an attention\nmechanism. JPerceiver can be trained in an end-to-end multi-task learning way,\nwhere the CGT scale loss and CCT module promote inter-task knowledge transfer\nto benefit feature learning of each task.

By contrast, the bottom-up methods enjoy low\ncomputational costs as they are less affected by the number of humans. However,\nmost existing bottom-up methods treat camera-centric 3D human pose estimation\nas two unrelated subtasks: 2.5D pose estimation and camera-centric depth\nestimation. In this paper, we propose a unified model that leverages the mutual\nbenefits of both these subtasks. Within the framework, a robust structured 2.5D\npose estimation is designed to recognize inter-person occlusion based on depth\nrelationships. Additionally, we develop an end-to-end geometry-aware depth\nreasoning method that exploits the mutual benefits of both 2.5D pose and\ncamera-centric root depths. This method first uses 2.5D pose and geometry\ninformation to infer camera-centric root depths in a forward pass, and then\nexploits the root depths to further improve representation learning of 2.5D\npose estimation in a backward pass. Further, we designed an adaptive fusion\nscheme that leverages both visual perception and body geometry to alleviate\ninherent depth ambiguity issues.

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has altered living by controlling devices/things\nover the Internet. IoT has specified many smart solutions for daily problems,\ntransforming cyber-physical systems (CPS) and other classical fields into smart\nregions. Most of the edge devices that make up the Internet of Things have very\nminimal processing power. To bring down the IoT network, attackers can utilise\nthese devices to conduct a variety of network attacks. In addition, as more and\nmore IoT devices are added, the potential for new and unknown threats grows\nexponentially. For this reason, an intelligent security framework for IoT\nnetworks must be developed that can identify such threats. In this paper, we\nhave developed an unsupervised ensemble learning model that is able to detect\nnew or unknown attacks in an IoT network from an unlabelled dataset. The\nsystem-generated labelled dataset is used to train a deep learning model to\ndetect IoT network attacks. Additionally, the research presents a feature\nselection mechanism for identifying the most relevant aspects in the dataset\nfor detecting attacks. The study shows that the suggested model is able to\nidentify the unlabelled IoT network datasets and DBN (Deep Belief Network)\noutperform the other models with a detection accuracy of 97.5% and a false\nalarm rate of 2.3% when trained using labelled dataset supplied by the proposed\napproach.",

    "abstract": "Modeling users' dynamic preferences from historical behaviors lies at the\ncore of modern recommender systems. Due to the diverse nature of user\ninterests, recent advances propose the multi-interest networks to encode\nhistorical behaviors into multiple interest vectors. In real scenarios, the\ncorresponding items of captured interests are usually retrieved together to get\nexposure and collected into training data, which produces dependencies among\ninterests. Unfortunately, multi-interest networks may incorrectly concentrate\non subtle dependencies among captured interests. Misled by these dependencies,\nthe spurious correlations between irrelevant interests and targets are\ncaptured, resulting in the instability of prediction results when training and\ntest distributions do not match. In this paper, we introduce the widely used\nHilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) to measure the degree of\nindependence among captured interests and empirically show that the continuous\nincrease of HSIC may harm model performance. Based on this, we propose a novel\nmulti-interest network, named DEep Stable Multi-Interest Learning (DESMIL),\nwhich tries to eliminate the influence of subtle dependencies among captured\ninterests via learning weights for training samples and make model concentrate\nmore on underlying true causation. We conduct extensive experiments on public\nrecommendation datasets, a large-scale industrial dataset and the synthetic\ndatasets which simulate the out-of-distribution data. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our proposed DESMIL outperforms state-of-the-art models by a\nsignificant margin.

    "abstract": "The current studies of Scene Graph Generation (SGG) focus on solving the\nlong-tailed problem for generating unbiased scene graphs. However, most\nde-biasing methods overemphasize the tail predicates and underestimate head\nones throughout training, thereby wrecking the representation ability of head\npredicate features. Furthermore, these impaired features from head predicates\nharm the learning of tail predicates. In fact, the inference of tail predicates\nheavily depends on the general patterns learned from head ones, e.g., \"standing\non\" depends on \"on\". Thus, these de-biasing SGG methods can neither achieve\nexcellent performance on tail predicates nor satisfying behaviors on head ones.\nTo address this issue, we propose a Dual-branch Hybrid Learning network (DHL)\nto take care of both head predicates and tail ones for SGG, including a\nCoarse-grained Learning Branch (CLB) and a Fine-grained Learning Branch (FLB).\nSpecifically, the CLB is responsible for learning expertise and robust features\nof head predicates, while the FLB is expected to predict informative tail\npredicates. Furthermore, DHL is equipped with a Branch Curriculum Schedule\n(BCS) to make the two branches work well together. Experiments show that our\napproach achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on VG and GQA datasets and\nmakes a trade-off between the performance of tail predicates and head ones.\nMoreover, extensive experiments on two downstream tasks (i.e., Image Captioning\nand Sentence-to-Graph Retrieval) further verify the generalization and\npracticability of our method.",

However, with the high flexibility comes the difficulty in design\nand optimization. Conventionally, these accelerators are designed with\nlow-level hardware descriptive languages, which means creating large designs\nwith complex behavior is extremely difficult. Therefore, high-level synthesis\n(HLS) tools were created to simplify hardware designs for FPGAs. They enable\nthe user to create hardware designs using high-level languages and provide\nvarious optimization directives to help to improve the performance of the\nsynthesized hardware. However, applying these optimizations to achieve high\nperformance is time-consuming and usually requires expert knowledge. To address\nthis difficulty, we present an automated design space exploration tool for\napplying HLS optimization directives, called Chimera, which significantly\nreduces the human effort and expertise needed for creating high-performance HLS\ndesigns. It utilizes a novel multi-objective exploration method that seamlessly\nintegrates active learning, evolutionary algorithm, and Thompson sampling,\nmaking it capable of finding a set of optimized designs on a Pareto curve with\nonly a small number of design points evaluated during the exploration. In the\nexperiments, in less than 24 hours, this hybrid method explored design points\nthat have the same or superior performance compared to highly optimized\nhand-tuned designs created by expert HLS users from the Rosetta benchmark\nsuite.

To deal with these issues, smart agriculture solutions\nare evolving that combine the Internet of Things and machine learning for early\ndisease detection and control. Many such systems use vision-based machine\nlearning methods for real-time disease detection and diagnosis. With the\nadvancement in deep learning techniques, new methods have emerged that employ\nconvolutional neural networks for plant disease detection and identification.\nAnother trend in vision-based deep learning is the use of vision transformers,\nwhich have proved to be powerful models for classification and other problems.\nHowever, vision transformers have rarely been investigated for plant pathology\napplications.

As a remedy, we design the first neural algorithm that simulates\ninpainting with Euler's Elastica. We use the deep energy concept which employs\nthe variational energy as neural network loss.

However, they mainly focus on better matching between\nthe current frame and the memory frames without explicitly paying attention to\nthe quality of the memory. Therefore, frames with poor segmentation masks are\nprone to be memorized, which leads to a segmentation mask error accumulation\nproblem and further affect the segmentation performance.

To this end, we propose a\nQuality-aware Dynamic Memory Network (QDMN) to evaluate the segmentation\nquality of each frame, allowing the memory bank to selectively store accurately\nsegmented frames to prevent the error accumulation problem. Then, we combine\nthe segmentation quality with temporal consistency to dynamically update the\nmemory bank to improve the practicability of the models.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have exhibited remarkable performance in image\nsuper-resolution (SR) tasks by learning a mapping from low-resolution (LR)\nimages to high-resolution (HR) images. However, the SR problem is typically an\nill-posed problem and existing methods would come with several limitations.\nFirst, the possible mapping space of SR can be extremely large since there may\nexist many different HR images that can be downsampled to the same LR image. As\na result, it is hard to directly learn a promising SR mapping from such a large\nspace. Second, it is often inevitable to develop very large models with\nextremely high computational cost to yield promising SR performance. In\npractice, one can use model compression techniques to obtain compact models by\nreducing model redundancy. Nevertheless, it is hard for existing model\ncompression methods to accurately identify the redundant components due to the\nextremely large SR mapping space. To alleviate the first challenge, we propose\na dual regression learning scheme to reduce the space of possible SR mappings.\nSpecifically, in addition to the mapping from LR to HR images, we learn an\nadditional dual regression mapping to estimate the downsampling kernel and\nreconstruct LR images. In this way, the dual mapping acts as a constraint to\nreduce the space of possible mappings. To address the second challenge, we\npropose a lightweight dual regression compression method to reduce model\nredundancy in both layer-level and channel-level based on channel pruning.\nSpecifically, we first develop a channel number search method that minimizes\nthe dual regression loss to determine the redundancy of each layer. Given the\nsearched channel numbers, we further exploit the dual regression manner to\nevaluate the importance of channels and prune the redundant ones. Extensive\nexperiments show the effectiveness of our method in obtaining accurate and\nefficient SR models.",

Monocular detection has\nprogressed into two categories: (1)Direct methods that infer 3D bounding boxes\ndirectly from a frontal-view image; (2)3D intermedia representation methods\nthat map image features to 3D space for subsequent 3D detection. The second\ncategory is standing out not only because 3D detection forges ahead at the\nmercy of more meaningful and representative features, but because of emerging\nSOTA end-to-end prediction and planning paradigms that require a\nbird's-eye-view feature map from a perception pipeline. However, in\ntransforming to 3D representation, these methods do not guarantee that objects'\nimplicit orientations and locations in latent space are consistent with those\nexplicitly observed in Euclidean space, which will hurt model performance.\nHence, we argue that the consistency of implicit and explicit features matters\nand present a novel monocular detection method, named CIEF, with the first\norientation-aware image backbone to eliminate the disparity of implicit and\nexplicit features in subsequent 3D representation. As a second contribution, we\nintroduce a ray attention mechanism. In contrast to previous methods that\nrepeat features along the projection ray or rely on another intermedia frustum\npoint cloud, we directly transform image features to voxel representations with\nwell-localized features. We also propose a handcrafted gaussian positional\nencoding function that outperforms the sinusoidal encoding function but\nmaintains the benefit of being continuous. CIEF ranked 1st among all reported\nmethods on both 3D and BEV detection benchmark of KITTI at submission time.",

    "abstract": "Text response generation for multimodal task-oriented dialog systems, which\naims to generate the proper text response given the multimodal context, is an\nessential yet challenging task. Although existing efforts have achieved\ncompelling success, they still suffer from two pivotal limitations: 1) overlook\nthe benefit of generative pre-training, and 2) ignore the textual context\nrelated knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose a novel dual\nknowledge-enhanced generative pretrained language model for multimodal\ntask-oriented dialog systems (DKMD), consisting of three key components: dual\nknowledge selection, dual knowledge-enhanced context learning, and\nknowledge-enhanced response generation. To be specific, the dual knowledge\nselection component aims to select the related knowledge according to both\ntextual and visual modalities of the given context. Thereafter, the dual\nknowledge-enhanced context learning component targets seamlessly integrating\nthe selected knowledge into the multimodal context learning from both global\nand local perspectives, where the cross-modal semantic relation is also\nexplored. Moreover, the knowledge-enhanced response generation component\ncomprises a revised BART decoder, where an additional dot-product\nknowledge-decoder attention sub-layer is introduced for explicitly utilizing\nthe knowledge to advance the text response generation. Extensive experiments on\na public dataset verify the superiority of the proposed DKMD over\nstate-of-the-art competitors.",

Recently, it has been shown that well-known Byzantine-resilient\ngradient aggregation schemes are indeed vulnerable to informed attackers that\ncan tailor the attacks (Fang et al., 2020; Xie et al., 2020b). We introduce\nMixTailor, a scheme based on randomization of the aggregation strategies that\nmakes it impossible for the attacker to be fully informed. Deterministic\nschemes can be integrated into MixTailor on the fly without introducing any\nadditional hyperparameters. Randomization decreases the capability of a\npowerful adversary to tailor its attacks, while the resulting randomized\naggregation scheme is still competitive in terms of performance. For both iid\nand non-iid settings, we establish almost sure convergence guarantees that are\nboth stronger and more general than those available in the literature.

    "abstract": "When a high-resolution (HR) image is degraded into a low-resolution (LR)\nimage, the image loses some of the existing information. Consequently, multiple\nHR images can correspond to the LR image. Most of the existing methods do not\nconsider the uncertainty caused by the stochastic attribute, which can only be\nprobabilistically inferred. Therefore, the predicted HR images are often blurry\nbecause the network tries to reflect all possibilities in a single output\nimage. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a novel face\nsuper-resolution (SR) scheme to take into the uncertainty by stochastic\nmodeling. Specifically, the information in LR images is separately encoded into\ndeterministic and stochastic attributes. Furthermore, an Input Conditional\nAttribute Predictor is proposed and separately trained to predict the partially\nalive stochastic attributes from only the LR images. Extensive evaluation shows\nthat the proposed method successfully reduces the uncertainty in the learning\nprocess and outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches.",

Afterward, Lloyd's iterative\nalgorithm is run. The $k$-means++ algorithm is known to return a $\\Theta(\\log\nk)$ approximate solution in expectation.\nIn their seminal work, Arthur and Vassilvitskii [SODA 2007] asked about the\nguarantees for its following \\emph{greedy} variant: in every step, we sample\n$\\ell$ candidate centers instead of one and then pick the one that minimizes\nthe new cost. This is also how $k$-means++ is implemented in e.g. the popular\nScikit-learn library [Pedregosa et al.; JMLR 2011].\nWe present nearly matching lower and upper bounds for the greedy $k$-means++:\nWe prove that it is an $O(\\ell^3 \\log^3 k)$-approximation algorithm.

    "abstract": "While parallel architectures based on clusters of Processing Elements (PEs)\nsharing L1 memory are widespread, there is no consensus on how lean their PE\nshould be. Architecting PEs as vector processors holds the promise to greatly\nreduce their instruction fetch bandwidth, mitigating the Von Neumann Bottleneck\n(VNB). However, due to their historical association with supercomputers,\nclassical vector machines include micro-architectural tricks to improve the\nInstruction Level Parallelism (ILP), which increases their instruction fetch\nand decode energy overhead. In this paper, we explore for the first time vector\nprocessing as an option to build small and efficient PEs for large-scale\nshared-L1 clusters. We propose Spatz, a compact, modular 32-bit vector\nprocessing unit based on the integer embedded subset of the RISC-V Vector\nExtension version 1.0. A Spatz-based cluster with four Multiply-Accumulate\nUnits (MACUs) needs only 7.9 pJ per 32-bit integer multiply-accumulate\noperation, 40% less energy than an equivalent cluster built with four Snitch\nscalar cores. We analyzed Spatz' performance by integrating it within MemPool,\na large-scale many-core shared-L1 cluster. The Spatz-based MemPool system\nachieves up to 285 GOPS when running a 256x256 32-bit integer matrix\nmultiplication, 70% more than the equivalent Snitch-based MemPool system. In\nterms of energy efficiency, the Spatz-based MemPool system achieves up to 266\nGOPS/W when running the same kernel, more than twice the energy efficiency of\nthe Snitch-based MemPool system, which reaches 128 GOPS/W. Those results show\nthe viability of lean vector processors as high-performance and\nenergy-efficient PEs for large-scale clusters with tightly-coupled L1 memory.",

    "abstract": "Game theory has by now found numerous applications in various fields,\nincluding economics, industry, jurisprudence, and artificial intelligence,\nwhere each player only cares about its own interest in a noncooperative or\ncooperative manner, but without obvious malice to other players. However, in\nmany practical applications, such as poker, chess, evader pursuing, drug\ninterdiction, coast guard, cyber-security, and national defense, players often\nhave apparently adversarial stances, that is, selfish actions of each player\ninevitably or intentionally inflict loss or wreak havoc on other players. Along\nthis line, this paper provides a systematic survey on three main game models\nwidely employed in adversarial games, i.e., zero-sum normal-form and\nextensive-form games, Stackelberg (security) games, zero-sum differential\ngames, from an array of perspectives, including basic knowledge of game models,\n(approximate) equilibrium concepts, problem classifications, research\nfrontiers, (approximate) optimal strategy seeking techniques, prevailing\nalgorithms, and practical applications. Finally, promising future research\ndirections are also discussed for relevant adversarial games.",

    "abstract": "Watermarking is a commonly used strategy to protect creators' rights to\ndigital images, videos and audio. Recently, watermarking methods have been\nextended to deep learning models -- in principle, the watermark should be\npreserved when an adversary tries to copy the model. However, in practice,\nwatermarks can often be removed by an intelligent adversary. Several papers\nhave proposed watermarking methods that claim to be empirically resistant to\ndifferent types of removal attacks, but these new techniques often fail in the\nface of new or better-tuned adversaries. In this paper, we propose a\ncertifiable watermarking method. Using the randomized smoothing technique\nproposed in Chiang et al., we show that our watermark is guaranteed to be\nunremovable unless the model parameters are changed by more than a certain l2\nthreshold. In addition to being certifiable, our watermark is also empirically\nmore robust compared to previous watermarking methods.

    "abstract": "Most existing compound facial expression recognition (FER) methods rely on\nlarge-scale labeled compound expression data for training. However, collecting\nsuch data is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we address the\ncompound FER task in the cross-domain few-shot learning (FSL) setting, which\nrequires only a few samples of compound expressions in the target domain.\nSpecifically, we propose a novel cascaded decomposition network (CDNet), which\ncascades several learn-to-decompose modules with shared parameters based on a\nsequential decomposition mechanism, to obtain a transferable feature space. To\nalleviate the overfitting problem caused by limited base classes in our task, a\npartial regularization strategy is designed to effectively exploit the best of\nboth episodic training and batch training. By training across similar tasks on\nmultiple basic expression datasets, CDNet learns the ability of\nlearn-to-decompose that can be easily adapted to identify unseen compound\nexpressions. Extensive experiments on both in-the-lab and in-the-wild compound\nexpression datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed CDNet against\nseveral state-of-the-art FSL methods.

Over the years, researchers\nhave introduced a variety of alternative reservoir topologies, such as a\ncircular network or a linear path of connections. When comparing the\nperformance of different topologies or other architectural changes, it is\nnecessary to tune the hyperparameters for each of the topologies separately\nsince their properties may significantly differ. The hyperparameter tuning is\nusually carried out manually by selecting the best performing set of parameters\nfrom a sparse grid of predefined combinations. Unfortunately, this approach may\nlead to underperforming configurations, especially for sensitive topologies.

In this paper, we consider\nindivisible PB which involves allocating an available, limited budget to a set\nof indivisible projects, each having a certain cost, based on the preferences\nof agents over projects. The specific, important, research gap that we address\nin this paper is to propose classes of rules for indivisible PB with weak\nrankings (i.e., weak ordinal preferences) and investigate their key algorithmic\nand axiomatic issues. We propose two classes of rules having distinct\nsignificance and motivation. The first is layered approval rules which enable\nweak rankings to be studied by carefully translating them into approval votes.\nThe second is need-based rules which enable to capture fairness issues. Under\nlayered approval rules, we study two natural families of rules:\ngreedy-truncation rules and cost-worthy rules. The paper has two parts. In the\nfirst part, we investigate algorithmic and complexity related issues for the\nproposed rules. In the second part, we present a detailed axiomatic analysis of\nthese rules, for which, we examine and generalize axioms in the literature and\nalso introduce a new axiom, pro-affordability. The paper helps to highlight the\ntrade-offs among practical appeal, computational complexity, and axiomatic\ncompliance of these rules.",

In fact, in the\nsingle-peaked domain, it is known that unanimous and strategy-proof\ndeterministic rules have to be min-max rules and those that also satisfy\nanonymity have to be median rules. Further, random social choice rules\nsatisfying these properties have been shown to be convex combinations of\nrespective deterministic rules. We non-trivially add to this body of results by\nincluding fairness considerations in social choice. Our study directly\naddresses fairness for groups of agents. To study group-fairness, we consider\nan existing partition of the agents into logical groups, based on natural\nattributes such as gender, race, and location. To capture fairness within each\ngroup, we introduce the notion of group-wise anonymity. To capture fairness\nacross the groups, we propose a weak notion as well as a strong notion of\nfairness. The proposed fairness notions turn out to be natural generalizations\nof existing individual-fairness notions and moreover provide non-trivial\noutcomes for strict ordinal preferences, unlike the existing group-fairness\nnotions. We provide two separate characterizations of random social choice\nrules that satisfy group-fairness: (i) direct characterization (ii) extreme\npoint characterization (as convex combinations of fair deterministic social\nchoice rules).

In cryptographic\nself-selection, each round $r$ has a seed $Q_r$. In round $r$, each account\nowner is asked to digitally sign $Q_r$, hash their digital signature to produce\na credential, and then broadcast this credential to the entire network. A\npublicly-known function scores each credential in a manner so that the\ndistribution of the lowest scoring credential is identical to the distribution\nof stake owned by each account. The user who broadcasts the lowest-scoring\ncredential is the leader for round $r$, and their credential becomes the seed\n$Q_{r+1}$. Such protocols leave open the possibility of a selfish-mining style\nattack: a user who owns multiple accounts that each produce low-scoring\ncredentials in round $r$ can selectively choose which ones to broadcast in\norder to influence the seed for round $r+1$. Indeed, the user can pre-compute\ntheir credentials for round $r+1$ for each potential seed, and broadcast only\nthe credential (among those with a low enough score to be the leader) that\nproduces the most favorable seed.\nWe consider an adversary who wishes to maximize the expected fraction of\nrounds in which an account they own is the leader. We show such an adversary\nalways benefits from deviating from the intended protocol, regardless of the\nfraction of the stake controlled.

At its core is a novel\ndiffusion-based stereo module, which introduces diffusion models, a type of\npowerful generative models, into the iterative stereo matching network. To this\nend, we design a new diffusion kernel and additional stereo constraints to\nfacilitate stereo matching and depth estimation in the network. We further\npresent a multi-level stereo network architecture to handle high-resolution (up\nto 4k) inputs without requiring unaffordable memory footprint. Given a set of\nsparse-view color images of a human, the proposed multi-level diffusion-based\nstereo network can produce highly accurate depth maps, which are then converted\ninto a high-quality 3D human model through an efficient multi-view fusion\nstrategy. Overall, our method enables automatic reconstruction of human models\nwith quality on par to high-end dense-view camera rigs, and this is achieved\nusing a much more light-weight hardware setup. Experiments show that our method\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin both qualitatively and\nquantitatively.",

    "abstract": "A self-supervised multi-task learning (SSMTL) framework for video anomaly\ndetection was recently introduced in literature. Due to its highly accurate\nresults, the method attracted the attention of many researchers. In this work,\nwe revisit the self-supervised multi-task learning framework, proposing several\nupdates to the original method. First, we study various detection methods, e.g.\nbased on detecting high-motion regions using optical flow or background\nsubtraction, since we believe the currently used pre-trained YOLOv3 is\nsuboptimal, e.g. objects in motion or objects from unknown classes are never\ndetected. Second, we modernize the 3D convolutional backbone by introducing\nmulti-head self-attention modules, inspired by the recent success of vision\ntransformers. As such, we alternatively introduce both 2D and 3D convolutional\nvision transformer (CvT) blocks. Third, in our attempt to further improve the\nmodel, we study additional self-supervised learning tasks, such as predicting\nsegmentation maps through knowledge distillation, solving jigsaw puzzles,\nestimating body pose through knowledge distillation, predicting masked regions\n(inpainting), and adversarial learning with pseudo-anomalies. We conduct\nexperiments to assess the performance impact of the introduced changes. Upon\nfinding more promising configurations of the framework, dubbed SSMTL++v1 and\nSSMTL++v2, we extend our preliminary experiments to more data sets,\ndemonstrating that our performance gains are consistent across all data sets.\nIn most cases, our results on Avenue, ShanghaiTech and UBnormal raise the\nstate-of-the-art performance to a new level.",

To do so, we separate our experiences\ninto fundamental atomic components. These atomic components can then be\nrecombined in novel ways to support our ability to imagine and engage with\nnovel experiences. We frame this as the ability to learn to generalise\ncompositionally. And, we will refer to behaviours making use of this ability as\ncompositional learning behaviours (CLBs).\nA central problem to learning CLBs is the resolution of a binding problem\n(BP) (by learning to, firstly, segregate the supportive stimulus components\nfrom the observation of multiple stimuli, and then, combine them in a single\nepisodic experience). While it is another feat of intelligence that human\nbeings perform with ease, it is not the case for state-of-the-art artificial\nagents.\nThus, in order to build artificial agents able to collaborate with human\nbeings, we propose to develop a novel benchmark to investigate agents'\nabilities to exhibit CLBs by solving a domain-agnostic version of the BP. We\ntake inspiration from the language emergence and grounding framework of\nreferential games and propose a meta-learning extension of referential games,\nentitled Meta-Referential Games, and use this framework to build our benchmark,\nthat we name Symbolic Behaviour Benchmark (S2B).\nWhile it has the potential to test for more symbolic behaviours, rather than\nsolely CLBs, in the present paper, though, we solely focus on the single-agent\nlanguage grounding task that tests for CLBs. We provide baseline results for\nit, using state-of-the-art RL agents, and show that our proposed benchmark is a\ncompelling challenge that we hope will spur the research community towards\ndeveloping more capable artificial agents.",

When the number of rounds $R = O(1)$, we will need at least a\npolynomial number of agents (in terms of the number of arms) to achieve a\nspeedup greater than $1$. This is in sharp contrast with the IID data setting,\nin which the speedup is always at least $1$ when $R \\ge 2$ regardless of number\nof agents.\nb) Adaptivity in the learning process cannot help much in the non-IID data\nsetting. This is in sharp contrast with the IID data setting, in which to\nachieve the same speedup, the best non-adaptive algorithm requires a\nsignificantly larger number of rounds than the best adaptive algorithm.\nIn the technique space, we have further developed the generalized round\nelimination technique introduced in arXiv:1904.03293.

Specifically, this study investigates\nthe use of drone raw data at a busy three-way signalized intersection in\nAthens, Greece, and builds on the open data initiative of the pNEUMA\nexperiment. Using a microscopic approach and shockwave analysis on data\nextracted from realtime videos, we estimated the maximum queue length, whether,\nwhen, and where a spillback occurred, vehicle stops, vehicle travel time and\ndelay, crash rates, fuel consumption, CO2 emissions, and fundamental diagrams.\nResults of the various MOEs were found to be promising, which confirms that the\nuse of traffic data collected by drones has many applications. We also\ndemonstrate that estimating MOEs in real-time is achievable using drone data.\nSuch models have the ability to track individual vehicle movements within\nstreet networks and thus allow the modeler to consider any traffic conditions,\nranging from highly under-saturated to highly over-saturated conditions. These\nmicroscopic models have the advantage of capturing the impact of transient\nvehicle behavior on various MOEs.",

    "abstract": "A combinatorial problem concerning the maximum size of the (hamming) weight\nset of an $[n,k]_q$ linear code was recently introduced. Codes attaining the\nestablished upper bound are the Maximum Weight Spectrum (MWS) codes. Those\n$[n,k]_q $ codes with the same weight set as $ \\mathbb{F}_q^n $ are called Full\nWeight Spectrum (FWS) codes. FWS codes are necessarily ``short\", whereas MWS\ncodes are necessarily ``long\". For fixed $ k,q $ the values of $ n $ for which\nan $ [n,k]_q $-FWS code exists are completely determined, but the determination\nof the minimum length $ M(H,k,q) $ of an $ [n,k]_q $-MWS code remains an open\nproblem. The current work broadens discussion first to general coordinate-wise\nweight functions, and then specifically to the Lee weight and a Manhattan like\nweight. In the general case we provide bounds on $ n $ for which an FWS code\nexists, and bounds on $ n $ for which an MWS code exists. When specializing to\nthe Lee or to the Manhattan setting we are able to completely determine the\nparameters of FWS codes. As with the Hamming case, we are able to provide an\nupper bound on $ M(\\mathcal{L},k,q) $ (the minimum length of Lee MWS codes),\nand pose the determination of $ M(\\mathcal{L},k,q) $ as an open problem. On the\nother hand, with respect to the Manhattan weight we completely determine the\nparameters of MWS codes.",

Systematic\nerrors result from nearly deterministic transformations that occur repeatedly\nin the data, e.g. specific image pixels being set to default values or\nwatermarks. Consequently, models with enough capacity easily overfit to these\nerrors, making detection and repair difficult. Seeing as a systematic outlier\nis a combination of patterns of a clean instance and systematic error patterns,\nour main insight is that inliers can be modelled by a smaller representation\n(subspace) in a model than outliers. By exploiting this, we propose Clean\nSubspace Variational Autoencoder (CLSVAE), a novel semi-supervised model for\ndetection and automated repair of systematic errors. The main idea is to\npartition the latent space and model inlier and outlier patterns separately.\nCLSVAE is effective with much less labelled data compared to previous related\nmodels, often with less than 2% of the data.

    "abstract": "This work introduces a novel knowledge distillation framework for\nclassification tasks where information on existing subclasses is available and\ntaken into consideration. In classification tasks with a small number of\nclasses or binary detection, the amount of information transferred from the\nteacher to the student is restricted, thus limiting the utility of knowledge\ndistillation. Performance can be improved by leveraging information of possible\nsubclasses within the classes. To that end, we propose the so-called Subclass\nKnowledge Distillation (SKD), a process of transferring the knowledge of\npredicted subclasses from a teacher to a smaller student. Meaningful\ninformation that is not in the teacher's class logits but exists in subclass\nlogits (e.g., similarities within classes) will be conveyed to the student\nthrough the SKD, which will then boost the student's performance. Analytically,\nwe measure how much extra information the teacher can provide the student via\nthe SKD to demonstrate the efficacy of our work. The framework developed is\nevaluated in clinical application, namely colorectal polyp binary\nclassification. It is a practical problem with two classes and a number of\nsubclasses per class. In this application, clinician-provided annotations are\nused to define subclasses based on the annotation label's variability in a\ncurriculum style of learning. A lightweight, low-complexity student trained\nwith the SKD framework achieves an F1-score of 85.05%, an improvement of 1.47%,\nand a 2.10% gain over the student that is trained with and without conventional\nknowledge distillation, respectively. The 2.10% F1-score gap between students\ntrained with and without the SKD can be explained by the extra subclass\nknowledge, i.e., the extra 0.4656 label bits per sample that the teacher can\ntransfer in our experiment.",

While\nsignificant progress has been made for photorealistic image generation by using\ngenerative adversarial networks, it remains challenging to take a fine-grained\ncontrol on synthetic content. The instance normalization layer, which is widely\nadopted in existing image translation networks, washes away details in the\ninput sketch and leads to loss of precise control on the desired shape of the\ngenerated face images. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the effect\nof instance normalization on generating photorealistic face images from\nhand-drawn sketches. We first introduce a visualization approach to analyze the\nfeature embedding for sketches with a group of specific changes. Based on the\nvisual analysis, we modify the instance normalization layers in the baseline\nimage translation model. We elaborate a new set of hand-drawn sketches with 11\ncategories of specially designed changes and conduct extensive experimental\nanalysis. The results and user studies demonstrate that our method markedly\nimprove the quality of synthesized images and the conformance with user\nintention.",

Following the discovery of this\nvulnerability in real-world imaging and vision applications, the associated\nsafety concerns have attracted vast research attention, and many defense\ntechniques have been developed. Most of these defense methods rely on\nadversarial training (AT) -- training the classification network on images\nperturbed according to a specific threat model, which defines the magnitude of\nthe allowed modification. Although AT leads to promising results, training on a\nspecific threat model fails to generalize to other types of perturbations. A\ndifferent approach utilizes a preprocessing step to remove the adversarial\nperturbation from the attacked image. In this work, we follow the latter path\nand aim to develop a technique that leads to robust classifiers across various\nrealizations of threat models. To this end, we harness the recent advances in\nstochastic generative modeling, and means to leverage these for sampling from\nconditional distributions. Our defense relies on an addition of Gaussian i.i.d\nnoise to the attacked image, followed by a pretrained diffusion process -- an\narchitecture that performs a stochastic iterative process over a denoising\nnetwork, yielding a high perceptual quality denoised outcome. The obtained\nrobustness with this stochastic preprocessing step is validated through\nextensive experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset, showing that our method\noutperforms the leading defense methods under various threat models.",

A diverse set of similar rumours helps users to\ngeneralize, i.e., to understand the properties that govern the detection of\nrumours. Since the spread of rumours in social media is commonly modelled using\nfeature-annotated graphs, we propose a query-by-example approach that, given a\nrumour graph, extracts the $k$ most similar and diverse subgraphs from past\nrumours. The challenge is that all of the computations require fast assessment\nof similarities between graphs.

However, such PLM-based context\nmodeling can be not that aspect-specific. Therefore, a key question is left\nunder-explored: how the aspect-specific context can be better modeled through\nPLMs? To answer the question, we attempt to enhance aspect-specific context\nmodeling with PLM in a non-intrusive manner. We propose three aspect-specific\ninput transformations, namely aspect companion, aspect prompt, and aspect\nmarker. Informed by these transformations, non-intrusive aspect-specific PLMs\ncan be achieved to promote the PLM to pay more attention to the aspect-specific\ncontext in a sentence. Additionally, we craft an adversarial benchmark for ABSA\n(advABSA) to see how aspect-specific modeling can impact model robustness.\nExtensive experimental results on standard and adversarial benchmarks for SC\nand OE demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method,\nyielding new state-of-the-art performance on OE and competitive performance on\nSC.",

    "abstract": "In backscatter communication (BC), a passive tag transmits information by\njust affecting an external electromagnetic field through load modulation.\nThereby, the feed current of the excited tag antenna is modulated by adapting\nthe passive termination load. This paper studies the achievable information\nrates with a freely adaptable passive load. As a prerequisite, we unify\nmonostatic, bistatic, and ambient BC with circuit-based system modeling. A\ncrucial insight is that channel capacity is described by existing results on\npeak-power-limited quadrature Gaussian channels, because the steady-state tag\ncurrent phasor lies on a disk. Consequently, we derive the channel capacity in\nthe case of an unmodulated external field, for a general passive or purely\nreactive or resistive tag load. We find that modulating both resistance and\nreactance is crucial for high rates. We discuss the capacity-achieving load\nstatistics, the rate asymptotics, and the capacity of ambient BC in important\nspecial cases.\nFurthermore, we propose a capacity-approaching finite constellation design: a\ntailored amplitude-and-phase-shift keying on the reflection coefficient.

    "title": "A Multibias-mitigated and Sentiment Knowledge Enriched Transformer for  Debiasing in Multimodal Conversational Emotion Recognition",
    "abstract": "Multimodal emotion recognition in conversations (mERC) is an active research\ntopic in natural language processing (NLP), which aims to predict human's\nemotional states in communications of multiple modalities, e,g., natural\nlanguage and facial gestures. Innumerable implicit prejudices and\npreconceptions fill human language and conversations, leading to the question\nof whether the current data-driven mERC approaches produce a biased error. For\nexample, such approaches may offer higher emotional scores on the utterances by\nfemales than males. In addition, the existing debias models mainly focus on\ngender or race, where multibias mitigation is still an unexplored task in mERC.\nIn this work, we take the first step to solve these issues by proposing a\nseries of approaches to mitigate five typical kinds of bias in textual\nutterances (i.e., gender, age, race, religion and LGBTQ+) and visual\nrepresentations (i.e, gender and age), followed by a Multibias-Mitigated and\nsentiment Knowledge Enriched bi-modal Transformer (MMKET). Comprehensive\nexperimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed model and prove\nthat the debias operation has a great impact on the classification performance\nfor mERC. We hope our study will benefit the development of bias mitigation in\nmERC and related emotion studies.",

    "abstract": "There is a widespread belief that the tone of US political language has\nbecome more negative recently, in particular when Donald Trump entered\npolitics. At the same time, there is disagreement as to whether Trump changed\nor merely continued previous trends. To date, data-driven evidence regarding\nthese questions is scarce, partly due to the difficulty of obtaining a\ncomprehensive, longitudinal record of politicians' utterances. Here we apply\npsycholinguistic tools to a novel, comprehensive corpus of 24 million quotes\nfrom online news attributed to 18,627 US politicians in order to analyze how\nthe tone of US politicians' language evolved between 2008 and 2020. We show\nthat, whereas the frequency of negative emotion words had decreased\ncontinuously during Obama's tenure, it suddenly and lastingly increased with\nthe 2016 primary campaigns, by 1.6 pre-campaign standard deviations, or 8% of\nthe pre-campaign mean, in a pattern that emerges across parties. The effect\nsize drops by 40% when omitting Trump's quotes, and by 50% when averaging over\nspeakers rather than quotes, implying that prominent speakers, and Trump in\nparticular, have disproportionately, though not exclusively, contributed to the\nrise in negative language. This work provides the first large-scale data-driven\nevidence of a drastic shift toward a more negative political tone following\nTrump's campaign start as a catalyst, with important implications for the\ndebate about the state of US politics.",

    "abstract": "The classical pattern matching paradigm is that of seeking occurrences of one\nstring - the pattern, in another - the text, where both strings are drawn from\nan alphabet set $\\Sigma$. Assuming the text length is $n$ and the pattern\nlength is $m$, this problem can naively be solved in time $O(nm)$. In Knuth,\nMorris and Pratt's seminal paper of 1977, an automaton, was developed that\nallows solving this problem in time $O(n)$ for any alphabet.\nThis automaton, which we will refer to as the {\\em KMP-automaton}, has proven\nuseful in solving many other problems. A notable example is the {\\em\nparameterized pattern matching} model. In this model, a consistent renaming of\nsymbols from $\\Sigma$ is allowed in a match. The parameterized matching\nparadigm has proven useful in problems in software engineering, computer\nvision, and other applications.\nIt has long been suspected that for texts where the symbols are uniformly\nrandom, the naive algorithm will perform as well as the KMP algorithm. In this\npaper we examine the practical efficiency of the KMP algorithm vs. the naive\nalgorithm on a randomly generated text. We analyse the time under various\nparameters, such as alphabet size, pattern length, and the distribution of\npattern occurrences in the text. We do this for both the original exact\nmatching problem and parameterized matching. While the folklore wisdom is\nvindicated by these findings for the exact matching case, surprisingly, the KMP\nalgorithm works significantly faster than the naive in the parameterized\nmatching case.\nWe check this hypothesis for DNA texts, and observe a similar behaviour as in\nthe random text. We also show a very structured case where the automaton is\nmuch more efficient.",

    "abstract": "Existing learning-based methods for blind image quality assessment (BIQA) are\nheavily dependent on large amounts of annotated training data, and usually\nsuffer from a severe performance degradation when encountering the\ndomain/distribution shift problem. Thanks to the development of unsupervised\ndomain adaptation (UDA), some works attempt to transfer the knowledge from a\nlabel-sufficient source domain to a label-free target domain under domain shift\nwith UDA. However, it requires the coexistence of source and target data, which\nmight be impractical for source data due to the privacy or storage issues. In\nthis paper, we take the first step towards the source-free unsupervised domain\nadaptation (SFUDA) in a simple yet efficient manner for BIQA to tackle the\ndomain shift without access to the source data. Specifically, we cast the\nquality assessment task as a rating distribution prediction problem. Based on\nthe intrinsic properties of BIQA, we present a group of well-designed\nself-supervised objectives to guide the adaptation of the BN affine parameters\ntowards the target domain. Among them, minimizing the prediction entropy and\nmaximizing the batch prediction diversity aim to encourage more confident\nresults while avoiding the trivial solution. Besides, based on the observation\nthat the IQA rating distribution of single image follows the Gaussian\ndistribution, we apply Gaussian regularization to the predicted rating\ndistribution to make it more consistent with the nature of human scoring.\nExtensive experimental results under cross-domain scenarios demonstrated the\neffectiveness of our proposed method to mitigate the domain shift.",

Our\nframework operates in a Markov state-space model via a set of actions under\nunknown pre-conditions. We formulate skills as high-level abstract policies\nthat propose action plans based on the current state. Each policy learns new\nplans by observing the states' transitions while the agent interacts with the\nworld. Such an approach automatically learns new plans to achieve specific\nintended effects, but the success of such plans is often dependent on the\nstates in which they are applicable. Therefore, we formulate the evaluation of\nsuch plans as infinitely many multi-armed bandit problems, where we balance the\nallocation of resources on evaluating the success probability of existing arms\nand exploring new options. The result is a planner capable of automatically\nlearning robust high-level skills under a noisy environment; such skills\nimplicitly learn the action pre-condition without explicit knowledge. We show\nthat this planning approach is experimentally very competitive in\nhigh-dimensional state space domains.",

The key reason of this phenomenon is the coupled\nformulation of NeRV, which outputs the spatial and temporal information of\nvideo frames directly from the frame index input. In this paper, we propose\nE-NeRV, which dramatically expedites NeRV by decomposing the image-wise\nimplicit neural representation into separate spatial and temporal context.\nUnder the guidance of this new formulation, our model greatly reduces the\nredundant model parameters, while retaining the representation ability.

    "abstract": "Despite the demonstrated editing capacity in the latent space of a pretrained\nGAN model, inverting real-world images is stuck in a dilemma that the\nreconstruction cannot be faithful to the original input. The main reason for\nthis is that the distributions between training and real-world data are\nmisaligned, and because of that, it is unstable of GAN inversion for real image\nediting. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN prior based editing framework to\ntackle the out-of-domain inversion problem with a composition-decomposition\nparadigm. In particular, during the phase of composition, we introduce a\ndifferential activation module for detecting semantic changes from a global\nperspective, \\ie, the relative gap between the features of edited and unedited\nimages. With the aid of the generated Diff-CAM mask, a coarse reconstruction\ncan intuitively be composited by the paired original and edited images. In this\nway, the attribute-irrelevant regions can be survived in almost whole, while\nthe quality of such an intermediate result is still limited by an unavoidable\nghosting effect. Consequently, in the decomposition phase, we further present a\nGAN prior based deghosting network for separating the final fine edited image\nfrom the coarse reconstruction. Extensive experiments exhibit superiorities\nover the state-of-the-art methods, in terms of qualitative and quantitative\nevaluations. The robustness and flexibility of our method is also validated on\nboth scenarios of single attribute and multi-attribute manipulations.",

Game\ntheory has been used to answer some of the basic questions about adversarial\ndeep learning such as the existence of a classifier with optimal robustness and\nthe existence of optimal adversarial samples for a given class of classifiers.\nIn most previous work, adversarial deep learning was formulated as a\nsimultaneous game and the strategy spaces are assumed to be certain probability\ndistributions in order for the Nash equilibrium to exist.

In this paper, we give answers to\nthese basic questions for the practical case where the classifiers are DNNs\nwith a given structure, by formulating the adversarial deep learning as\nsequential games. The existence of Stackelberg equilibria for these games are\nproved. Furthermore, it is shown that the equilibrium DNN has the largest\nadversarial accuracy among all DNNs with the same structure, when\nCarlini-Wagner's margin loss is used.

    "title": "Improving Deep Neural Network Random Initialization Through Neuronal  Rewiring",
    "abstract": "The deep learning literature is continuously updated with new architectures\nand training techniques. However, weight initialization is overlooked by most\nrecent research, despite some intriguing findings regarding random weights. On\nthe other hand, recent works have been approaching Network Science to\nunderstand the structure and dynamics of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)\nafter training. Therefore, in this work, we analyze the centrality of neurons\nin randomly initialized networks. We show that a higher neuronal strength\nvariance may decrease performance, while a lower neuronal strength variance\nusually improves it. A new method is then proposed to rewire neuronal\nconnections according to a preferential attachment (PA) rule based on their\nstrength, which significantly reduces the strength variance of layers\ninitialized by common methods. In this sense, PA rewiring only reorganizes\nconnections, while preserving the magnitude and distribution of the weights. We\nshow through an extensive statistical analysis in image classification that\nperformance is improved in most cases, both during training and testing, when\nusing both simple and complex architectures and learning schedules. Our results\nshow that, aside from the magnitude, the organization of the weights is also\nrelevant for better initialization of deep ANNs.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale Vision-and-Language (V+L) pre-training for representation\nlearning has proven to be effective in boosting various downstream V+L tasks.\nHowever, when it comes to the fashion domain, existing V+L methods are\ninadequate as they overlook the unique characteristics of both the fashion V+L\ndata and downstream tasks. In this work, we propose a novel fashion-focused V+L\nrepresentation learning framework, dubbed as FashionViL. It contains two novel\nfashion-specific pre-training tasks designed particularly to exploit two\nintrinsic attributes with fashion V+L data. First, in contrast to other domains\nwhere a V+L data point contains only a single image-text pair, there could be\nmultiple images in the fashion domain. We thus propose a Multi-View Contrastive\nLearning task for pulling closer the visual representation of one image to the\ncompositional multimodal representation of another image+text. Second, fashion\ntext (e.g., product description) often contains rich fine-grained concepts\n(attributes/noun phrases). To exploit this, a Pseudo-Attributes Classification\ntask is introduced to encourage the learned unimodal (visual/textual)\nrepresentations of the same concept to be adjacent. Further, fashion V+L tasks\nuniquely include ones that do not conform to the common one-stream or\ntwo-stream architectures (e.g., text-guided image retrieval). We thus propose a\nflexible, versatile V+L model architecture consisting of a modality-agnostic\nTransformer so that it can be flexibly adapted to any downstream tasks.\nExtensive experiments show that our FashionViL achieves a new state of the art\nacross five downstream tasks.

    "abstract": "We study a general scenario of simultaneous contests that allocate prizes\nbased on equal sharing: each contest awards its prize to all players who\nsatisfy some contest-specific criterion, and the value of this prize to a\nwinner decreases as the number of winners increases. The players produce\noutputs for a set of activities, and the winning criteria of the contests are\nbased on these outputs. We consider two variations of the model: (i) players\nhave costs for producing outputs; (ii) players do not have costs but have\ngeneralized budget constraints. We observe that these games are exact potential\ngames and hence always have a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. The price of\nanarchy is $2$ for the budget model, but can be unbounded for the cost model.\nOur main results are for the computational complexity of these games. We prove\nthat for general versions of the model exactly or approximately computing a\nbest response is NP-hard. For natural restricted versions where best response\nis easy to compute, we show that finding a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium is\nPLS-complete, and finding a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium is\n(PPAD$\\cap$PLS)-complete.

Despite\ntheir emerging adoption, it is well known that NNs are susceptible to\nAdversarial Attacks. Hence, it is highly important to provide guarantees that\nsuch systems work correctly. To remedy these issues we introduce a framework\nfor repairing unsafe NNs w.r.t. safety specification, that is by utilizing\nsatisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers. Our method is able to search for\na new, safe NN representation, by modifying only a few of its weight values. In\naddition, our technique attempts to maximize the similarity to original network\nwith regard to its decision boundaries. We perform extensive experiments which\ndemonstrate the capability of our proposed framework to yield safe NNs w.r.t.\nthe Adversarial Robustness property, with only a mild loss of accuracy (in\nterms of similarity). Moreover, we compare our method with a naive baseline to\nempirically prove its effectiveness. To conclude, we provide an algorithm to\nautomatically repair NNs given safety properties, and suggest a few heuristics\nto improve its computational performance. Currently, by following this approach\nwe are capable of producing small-sized (i.e., with up to few hundreds of\nparameters) correct NNs, composed of the piecewise linear ReLU activation\nfunction.

It often remains unclear what kind of distance metric is suitable\nfor similarity learning due to the complex temporal dynamics of the time series\ngenerated from event-triggered sensing, which is common in diverse\napplications, including automated driving, interactive healthcare, and smart\nhome automation. The overarching goal of this paper is to develop an\nunsupervised learning framework that is capable of learning task-aware\nsimilarities among unlabeled event-triggered time series. From the machine\nlearning vantage point, the proposed framework harnesses the power of both\nhierarchical multi-scale sequence autoencoders and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)\nto effectively learn the low-dimensional representations from the time series.\nFinally, the obtained similarity measure can be easily visualized for\nexplaining.

To address\nthis issue, developments of directional antennas and unmanned aerial vehicles\n(UAVs) enhance the robustness of the mmWave train-ground communication system.\nIn this paper, we propose a UAV and MRs relay assistance (UMRA) algorithm to\neffectively overcome link blockage, which can maximize the number of\ntransmission flows on the premise of meeting QoS requirements and channel\nqualities. First, we formulate a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP)\nproblem for UAV trajectory design and transmission scheduling in the\nfull-duplex (FD) mode. Then, in UMRA, the relay decision algorithm and\ntransmission scheduling algorithm based on graph theory are proposed, which\nmake a good tradeoff between computation complexity and system performance.\nExtensive simulation results show that a suitable UAV position will greatly\nimprove the performance of the UMRA algorithm and make it close to the optimal\nsolution.

    "abstract": "Serverless computing is an emerging cloud computing paradigm that frees\ndevelopers from server management. However, existing studies report that\nsoftware applications developed in serverless fashion (named serverless\napplications) severely suffer from cold start latency. We propose an\napplication-level performance optimization approach called LambdaLite, for\naccelerating the cold start for serverless applications. We first conduct a\nmeasurement study to investigate the possible root cause of the cold start\nproblem and find that application code loading latency is the dominant\noverhead. Therefore, loading only indispensable code from serverless\napplications can be an adequate solution. Based on this insight, we identify\ncode related to application functionalities by constructing the function-level\ncall graph, and separate other code (optional code) from the serverless\napplication. The separated optional code can be loaded on demand to avoid the\ninaccurate identification of indispensable code causing application failure. In\npractice, LambdaLite can be seamlessly deployed on existing serverless\nplatforms without the need to modify the underlying OSes or hypervisors, nor\nintroduce additional manual efforts to developers. Evaluation results on 15\nreal-world serverless applications show that our approach can significantly\nreduce the application code loading latency (up to 78.95%, on average 28.78%),\nthereby reducing the cold start latency. As a result, the total response\nlatency of serverless applications can be decreased by up to 42.05% (on average\n19.21%).

With the emergence of smart homes, smart phones and smart\nspeakers, SLU has become a key technology for the industry. In a classical SLU\napproach, an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) module transcribes the speech\nsignal into a textual representation from which a Natural Language\nUnderstanding (NLU) module extracts semantic information. Recently End-to-End\nSLU (E2E SLU) based on Deep Neural Networks has gained momentum since it\nbenefits from the joint optimization of the ASR and the NLU parts, hence\nlimiting the cascade of error effect of the pipeline architecture. However,\nlittle is known about the actual linguistic properties used by E2E models to\npredict concepts and intents from speech input. In this paper, we present a\nstudy identifying the signal features and other linguistic properties used by\nan E2E model to perform the SLU task. The study is carried out in the\napplication domain of a smart home that has to handle non-English (here French)\nvoice commands. The results show that a good E2E SLU performance does not\nalways require a perfect ASR capability. Furthermore, the results show the\nsuperior capabilities of the E2E model in handling background noise and\nsyntactic variation compared to the pipeline model. Finally, a finer-grained\nanalysis suggests that the E2E model uses the pitch information of the input\nsignal to identify voice command concepts.

    "title": "Zero-Shot Temporal Action Detection via Vision-Language Prompting",
    "abstract": "Existing temporal action detection (TAD) methods rely on large training data\nincluding segment-level annotations, limited to recognizing previously seen\nclasses alone during inference. Collecting and annotating a large training set\nfor each class of interest is costly and hence unscalable. Zero-shot TAD\n(ZS-TAD) resolves this obstacle by enabling a pre-trained model to recognize\nany unseen action classes. Meanwhile, ZS-TAD is also much more challenging with\nsignificantly less investigation. Inspired by the success of zero-shot image\nclassification aided by vision-language (ViL) models such as CLIP, we aim to\ntackle the more complex TAD task. An intuitive method is to integrate an\noff-the-shelf proposal detector with CLIP style classification. However, due to\nthe sequential localization (e.g, proposal generation) and classification\ndesign, it is prone to localization error propagation. To overcome this\nproblem, in this paper we propose a novel zero-Shot Temporal Action detection\nmodel via Vision-LanguagE prompting (STALE). Such a novel design effectively\neliminates the dependence between localization and classification by breaking\nthe route for error propagation in-between. We further introduce an interaction\nmechanism between classification and localization for improved optimization.\nExtensive experiments on standard ZS-TAD video benchmarks show that our STALE\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives. Besides, our model\nalso yields superior results on supervised TAD over recent strong competitors.\nThe PyTorch implementation of STALE is available at\nhttps://github.com/sauradip/STALE.",

    "abstract": "Exploiting pseudo labels (e.g., categories and bounding boxes) of unannotated\nobjects produced by a teacher detector have underpinned much of recent progress\nin semi-supervised object detection (SSOD). However, due to the limited\ngeneralization capacity of the teacher detector caused by the scarce\nannotations, the produced pseudo labels often deviate from ground truth,\nespecially those with relatively low classification confidences, thus limiting\nthe generalization performance of SSOD. To mitigate this problem, we propose a\ndual pseudo-label polishing framework for SSOD. Instead of directly exploiting\nthe pseudo labels produced by the teacher detector, we take the first attempt\nat reducing their deviation from ground truth using dual polishing learning,\nwhere two differently structured polishing networks are elaborately developed\nand trained using synthesized paired pseudo labels and the corresponding ground\ntruth for categories and bounding boxes on the given annotated objects,\nrespectively. By doing this, both polishing networks can infer more accurate\npseudo labels for unannotated objects through sufficiently exploiting their\ncontext knowledge based on the initially produced pseudo labels, and thus\nimprove the generalization performance of SSOD. Moreover, such a scheme can be\nseamlessly plugged into the existing SSOD framework for joint end-to-end\nlearning. In addition, we propose to disentangle the polished pseudo categories\nand bounding boxes of unannotated objects for separate category classification\nand bounding box regression in SSOD, which enables introducing more unannotated\nobjects during model training and thus further improve the performance.\nExperiments on both PASCAL VOC and MS COCO benchmarks demonstrate the\nsuperiority of the proposed method over existing state-of-the-art baselines.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning is a new machine learning paradigm dealing with\ndistributed model learning on independent devices. One of the many advantages\nof federated learning is that training data stay on devices (such as\nsmartphones), and only learned models are shared with a centralized server. In\nthe case of supervised learning, labeling is entrusted to the clients. However,\nacquiring such labels can be prohibitively expensive and error-prone for many\ntasks, such as human activity recognition. Hence, a wealth of data remains\nunlabelled and unexploited. Most existing federated learning approaches that\nfocus mainly on supervised learning have mostly ignored this mass of unlabelled\ndata. Furthermore, it is unclear whether standard federated Learning approaches\nare suited to self-supervised learning. The few studies that have dealt with\nthe problem have limited themselves to the favorable situation of homogeneous\ndatasets. This work lays the groundwork for a reference evaluation of federated\nLearning with Semi-Supervised Learning in a realistic setting. We show that\nstandard lightweight autoencoder and standard Federated Averaging fail to learn\na robust representation for Human Activity Recognition with several realistic\nheterogeneous datasets.

    "abstract": "Under low-light environment, handheld photography suffers from severe camera\nshake under long exposure settings. Although existing deblurring algorithms\nhave shown promising performance on well-exposed blurry images, they still\ncannot cope with low-light snapshots. Sophisticated noise and saturation\nregions are two dominating challenges in practical low-light deblurring. In\nthis work, we propose a novel non-blind deblurring method dubbed image and\nfeature space Wiener deconvolution network (INFWIDE) to tackle these problems\nsystematically. In terms of algorithm design, INFWIDE proposes a two-branch\narchitecture, which explicitly removes noise and hallucinates saturated regions\nin the image space and suppresses ringing artifacts in the feature space, and\nintegrates the two complementary outputs with a subtle multi-scale fusion\nnetwork for high quality night photograph deblurring. For effective network\ntraining, we design a set of loss functions integrating a forward imaging model\nand backward reconstruction to form a close-loop regularization to secure good\nconvergence of the deep neural network. Further, to optimize INFWIDE's\napplicability in real low-light conditions, a physical-process-based low-light\nnoise model is employed to synthesize realistic noisy night photographs for\nmodel training. Taking advantage of the traditional Wiener deconvolution\nalgorithm's physically driven characteristics and arisen deep neural network's\nrepresentation ability, INFWIDE can recover fine details while suppressing the\nunpleasant artifacts during deblurring. Extensive experiments on synthetic data\nand real data demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach.",

This\nlimits the applications of neural network models in real-world scenarios, where\nOOD samples exist. Many existing approaches identify the OOD instances via\nexploiting various cues, such as finding irregular patterns in the feature\nspace, logits space, gradient space or the raw space of images. In contrast,\nthis paper proposes a simple Test-time Linear Training (ETLT) method for OOD\ndetection. Empirically, we find that the probabilities of input images being\nout-of-distribution are surprisingly linearly correlated to the features\nextracted by neural networks. To be specific, many state-of-the-art OOD\nalgorithms, although designed to measure reliability in different ways,\nactually lead to OOD scores mostly linearly related to their image features.\nThus, by simply learning a linear regression model trained from the paired\nimage features and inferred OOD scores at test-time, we can make a more precise\nOOD prediction for the test instances. We further propose an online variant of\nthe proposed method, which achieves promising performance and is more practical\nin real-world applications. Remarkably, we improve FPR95 from $51.37\\%$ to\n$12.30\\%$ on CIFAR-10 datasets with maximum softmax probability as the base OOD\ndetector.

    "abstract": "We propose an algorithm to estimate the path-gradient of both the reverse and\nforward Kullback-Leibler divergence for an arbitrary manifestly invertible\nnormalizing flow. The resulting path-gradient estimators are straightforward to\nimplement, have lower variance, and lead not only to faster convergence of\ntraining but also to better overall approximation results compared to standard\ntotal gradient estimators. We also demonstrate that path-gradient training is\nless susceptible to mode-collapse.

    "abstract": "Contrastive-based self-supervised learning methods achieved great success in\nrecent years. However, self-supervision requires extremely long training epochs\n(e.g., 800 epochs for MoCo v3) to achieve promising results, which is\nunacceptable for the general academic community and hinders the development of\nthis topic. This work revisits the momentum-based contrastive learning\nframeworks and identifies the inefficiency in which two augmented views\ngenerate only one positive pair. We propose Fast-MoCo - a novel framework that\nutilizes combinatorial patches to construct multiple positive pairs from two\naugmented views, which provides abundant supervision signals that bring\nsignificant acceleration with neglectable extra computational cost. Fast-MoCo\ntrained with 100 epochs achieves 73.5% linear evaluation accuracy, similar to\nMoCo v3 (ResNet-50 backbone) trained with 800 epochs. Extra training (200\nepochs) further improves the result to 75.1%, which is on par with\nstate-of-the-art methods. Experiments on several downstream tasks also confirm\nthe effectiveness of Fast-MoCo.",

    "abstract": "Life-long learning aims at learning a sequence of tasks without forgetting\nthe previously acquired knowledge. However, the involved training data may not\nbe life-long legitimate due to privacy or copyright reasons. In practical\nscenarios, for instance, the model owner may wish to enable or disable the\nknowledge of specific tasks or specific samples from time to time. Such\nflexible control over knowledge transfer, unfortunately, has been largely\noverlooked in previous incremental or decremental learning methods, even at a\nproblem-setup level. In this paper, we explore a novel learning scheme, termed\nas Learning wIth Recoverable Forgetting (LIRF), that explicitly handles the\ntask- or sample-specific knowledge removal and recovery. Specifically, LIRF\nbrings in two innovative schemes, namely knowledge deposit and withdrawal,\nwhich allow for isolating user-designated knowledge from a pre-trained network\nand injecting it back when necessary. During the knowledge deposit process, the\nspecified knowledge is extracted from the target network and stored in a\ndeposit module, while the insensitive or general knowledge of the target\nnetwork is preserved and further augmented. During knowledge withdrawal, the\ntaken-off knowledge is added back to the target network. The deposit and\nwithdraw processes only demand for a few epochs of finetuning on the removal\ndata, ensuring both data and time efficiency. We conduct experiments on several\ndatasets, and demonstrate that the proposed LIRF strategy yields encouraging\nresults with gratifying generalization capability.",

However, with the\ndramatic increase in real-time IIoT applications, it is a great challenge to\nsupport fast response time, low latency, and efficient bandwidth utilization.\nTo address this issue, Time Sensitive Network (TSN) is recently researched to\nrealize low latency communication via deterministic scheduling. To the best of\nour knowledge, the combinability of multiple flows, which can significantly\naffect the scheduling performance, has never been systematically analyzed\nbefore. In this article, we first analyze the combinability problem. Then a\nnon-collision theory based deterministic scheduling (NDS) method is proposed to\nachieve ultra-low latency communication for the time-sensitive flows. Moreover,\nto improve bandwidth utilization, a dynamic queue scheduling (DQS) method is\npresented for the best-effort flows.

    "abstract": "Fully or partial autonomous marine vessels are actively being developed by\nmany industry actors. In many cases, the autonomous vessels will be operating\nclose to shore, and within range of a Remote Control Center (RCC). Close to\nshore operation requires that the autonomous vessel is able to navigate in\nclose proximity to other autonomous or manned vessels, and possibly in confined\nwaters, while obeying the COLREGs on equal terms as any other vessel at sea. In\nconfined waters however, certain COLREGs rules apply, which might alter the\nexpected actions (give-way or stand-on), depending on the manoeuvrability of\nthe vessels. This paper presents a Situation Awareness (SAS) framework for\nautonomous navigation that complies with COLREGs rule 9 (Narrow Channels). The\nproposed solution comprises a method for evaluating the manoeuvrability of a\nvessel in confined waters, for assessing the applicability of COLREGs rule 9.\nThis feature is then integrated into an already existing SAS framework for\nfacilitating COLREGs-compliant navigation in restricted waters. The\napplicability of the proposed method is demonstrated in simulation using a case\nstudy of a small autonomous passenger ferry.",

Exploration and navigation in such an environment is an everyday\ntask, requiring no vast exertion of mental resources. Is it possible to turn\nthis fire hose of sensory information into a minimal latent state which is\nnecessary and sufficient for an agent to successfully act in the world? We\nformulate this question concretely, and propose the Agent-Controllable State\nDiscovery algorithm (AC-State), which has theoretical guarantees and is\npractically demonstrated to discover the \\textit{minimal controllable latent\nstate} which contains all of the information necessary for controlling the\nagent, while fully discarding all irrelevant information. This algorithm\nconsists of a multi-step inverse model (predicting actions from distant\nobservations) with an information bottleneck. AC-State enables localization,\nexploration, and navigation without reward or demonstrations. We demonstrate\nthe discovery of controllable latent state in three domains: localizing a robot\narm with distractions (e.g., changing lighting conditions and background),\nexploring in a maze alongside other agents, and navigating in the Matterport\nhouse simulator.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, many troll accounts have emerged to manipulate social media\nopinion. Detecting and eradicating trolling is a critical issue for\nsocial-networking platforms because businesses, abusers, and\nnation-state-sponsored troll farms use false and automated accounts. NLP\ntechniques are used to extract data from social networking text, such as\nTwitter tweets. In many text processing applications, word embedding\nrepresentation methods, such as BERT, have performed better than prior NLP\ntechniques, offering novel breaks to precisely comprehend and categorize\nsocial-networking information for various tasks. This paper implements and\ncompares nine deep learning-based troll tweet detection architectures, with\nthree models for each BERT, ELMo, and GloVe word embedding model. Precision,\nrecall, F1 score, AUC, and classification accuracy are used to evaluate each\narchitecture. From the experimental results, most architectures using BERT\nmodels improved troll tweet detection. A customized ELMo-based architecture\nwith a GRU classifier has the highest AUC for detecting troll messages. The\nproposed architectures can be used by various social-based systems to detect\ntroll messages in the future.",

Similar error analysis in the energy norm by Verf\\\"{u}rth indicates\nthat a dual norm of the {convective derivative of the} error must be added to\nthe natural energy norm in order for the natural residual estimator to be\nreliable and efficient. We show that the situation is similar for the maximum\nnorm. In particular, we define a mesh-dependent weighted seminorm of the\nconvective error which functions as a maximum-norm counterpart to the dual norm\nused in the energy norm setting. The total error is then defined as the sum of\nthis seminorm, the maximum norm of the error, and data oscillation. The natural\nmaximum norm residual error estimator is shown to be equivalent to this total\nerror notion, with constant independent of singular perturbation parameters.\nThese estimates are proved under the assumption that certain natural estimates\nhold for the Green's function for the problem at hand.

We seek to understand how the receiver's boundedly rational behavior\nimpacts the design of optimal signaling schemes, and whether there exists\nrobust signaling scheme when the receiver's boundedly rational behavior is\nunknown.\nFor both questions, we provide both positive and negative answers. At a\nhigh-level, a crucial condition that governs our answers is the sender's\nutility structure. For the first question, in contrast to the setting with a\nfully rational receiver where censorship signaling scheme is always optimal\n(Renault et al., 2017), we show that for a boundedly rational receiver, the\ncensorship signaling scheme remains optimal in state independent sender utility\n(SISU) environments, but is no longer optimal in state dependent sender utility\n(SDSU) environments. Nonetheless, we show that censorship signaling scheme is\n$\\Theta(m)$-approximation in SDSU environments, where $m$ is the number of\nstates. En route, we characterize the optimal signaling scheme in SDSU\nenvironments, in which the sender's signal either reveals the true state, or\nrandomizes the receiver's uncertainty on only two states. For the second\nquestion, we introduce rationality-robust information design -- a framework in\nwhich a signaling scheme is designed for a receiver with unknown boundedly\nrational behavior. We show that in SISU environments, up to a 2-approximation\nfactor, implementing optimal censorship signaling scheme of a fully rational\nreceiver is rationality-robust for any boundedly rational receiver.

This new class of methods can be\nconsidered a generalized version of the class of classical explicit pseudo\ntwo-step Runge-Kutta-Nystr\\\"{o}m methods. %The new methods will be denoted by\nGEPTRKN methods. We proved that an $s$-stage GEPTRKN method has step order of\naccuracy $p=s$ and stage order of accuracy $r=s$ for any set of distinct\ncollocation parameters $(c_i)_{i=1}^s$. Super-convergence for order of accuracy\nof these methods can be obtained if the collocation parameters $(c_i)_{i=1}^s$\nsatisfy some orthogonality conditions. We proved that an $s$-stage GEPTRKN\nmethod can attain order of accuracy $p=s+2$. Numerical experiments have shown\nthat the new methods work better than classical methods for solving non-stiff\nproblems even on sequential computing environments. By their structures, the\nnew methods will be much more efficient when implemented on parallel computers.",

    "abstract": "Histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) play a very important role in\nclinical studies and serve as the gold standard for many cancer diagnoses.\nHowever, generating automatic tools for processing WSIs is challenging due to\ntheir enormous sizes. Currently, to deal with this issue, conventional methods\nrely on a multiple instance learning (MIL) strategy to process a WSI at patch\nlevel. Although effective, such methods are computationally expensive, because\ntiling a WSI into patches takes time and does not explore the spatial relations\nbetween these tiles. To tackle these limitations, we propose a locally\nsupervised learning framework which processes the entire slide by exploring the\nentire local and global information that it contains. This framework divides a\npre-trained network into several modules and optimizes each module locally\nusing an auxiliary model. We also introduce a random feature reconstruction\nunit (RFR) to preserve distinguishing features during training and improve the\nperformance of our method by 1% to 3%. Extensive experiments on three publicly\navailable WSI datasets: TCGA-NSCLC, TCGA-RCC and LKS, highlight the superiority\nof our method on different classification tasks. Our method outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art MIL methods by 2% to 5% in accuracy, while being 7 to 10 times\nfaster. Additionally, when dividing it into eight modules, our method requires\nas little as 20% of the total gpu memory required by end-to-end training.

    "abstract": "The seminal work of Cohen and Peng introduced Lewis weight sampling to the\ntheoretical computer science community, yielding fast row sampling algorithms\nfor approximating $d$-dimensional subspaces of $\\ell_p$ up to $(1+\\epsilon)$\nerror. Several works have extended this important primitive to other settings,\nincluding the online coreset, sliding window, and adversarial streaming models.\nHowever, these results are only for $p\\in\\{1,2\\}$, and results for $p=1$\nrequire a suboptimal $\\tilde O(d^2/\\epsilon^2)$ samples.\nIn this work, we design the first nearly optimal $\\ell_p$ subspace embeddings\nfor all $p\\in(0,\\infty)$ in the online coreset, sliding window, and the\nadversarial streaming models. In all three models, our algorithms store $\\tilde\nO(d^{1\\lor(p/2)}/\\epsilon^2)$ rows. This answers a substantial generalization\nof the main open question of [BDMMUWZ2020], and gives the first results for all\n$p\\notin\\{1,2\\}$.\nTowards our result, we give the first analysis of \"one-shot'' Lewis weight\nsampling of sampling rows proportionally to their Lewis weights, with sample\ncomplexity $\\tilde O(d^{p/2}/\\epsilon^2)$ for $p>2$. Previously, this scheme\nwas only known to have sample complexity $\\tilde O(d^{p/2}/\\epsilon^5)$,\nwhereas $\\tilde O(d^{p/2}/\\epsilon^2)$ is known if a more sophisticated\nrecursive sampling is used. The recursive sampling cannot be implemented\nonline, thus necessitating an analysis of one-shot Lewis weight sampling. Our\nanalysis uses a novel connection to online numerical linear algebra.\nAs an application, we obtain the first one-pass streaming coreset algorithms\nfor $(1+\\epsilon)$ approximation of important generalized linear models, such\nas logistic regression and $p$-probit regression. Our upper bounds are\nparameterized by a complexity parameter $\\mu$ introduced by [MSSW2018], and we\nshow the first lower bounds showing that a linear dependence on $\\mu$ is\nnecessary.",

    "abstract": "Due to the promising future of Automated Program Repair (APR), researchers\nhave proposed various APR techniques, including heuristic-based,\ntemplate-based, and constraint-based techniques. Among such classic APR\ntechniques, template-based techniques have been widely recognized as state of\nthe art. However, such template-based techniques require predefined templates\nto perform repair, and their effectiveness is thus limited. To this end,\nresearchers leveraged the recent advances in Deep Learning to further improve\nAPR. Such learning-based techniques view APR as a Neural Machine Translation\nproblem, using the buggy/fixed code snippets as the source/target languages for\ntranslation. In this way, such techniques heavily rely on large numbers of\nhigh-quality bug-fixing commits, which can be extremely costly and challenging\nto construct. Furthermore, the edit variety of these learning-based techniques\nare limited to the available bug-fixes within their training datasets.\nTherefore, in this paper, we aim to revisit the learning-based APR problem, and\npropose AlphaRepair, to leverage zero-shot learning directly using large\npre-trained code models for APR. Our main insight is instead of modeling what a\nrepair edit should look like, we can directly predict what the correct code is\nbased on the context information. We have implemented AlphaRepair as a\npractical multilingual APR tool based on the recent CodeBERT model. Our results\non the widely used Defects4J benchmark show that AlphaRepair can substantially\noutperform state-of-the-art APR tools. We also studied the impact of different\ndesign choices and show that AlphaRepair performs even better on a newer\nversion of Defects4J (2.0) with 3.3X more fixes than best performing baseline,\nindicating that AlphaRepair can potentially avoid the dataset-overfitting issue\nof existing learning-based techniques.",

In\naddition to the size of the houses, PV-to-roof area ratio is highly dependent\non solar PV permitting timelines, proportion of renters and multifamily\nhousing, and winter weather risks.

However, the ideal invariances for many problems of\ninterest are often not known, which has led both to a body of engineering lore\nas well as attempts to provide frameworks for invariance learning. However,\ninvariance learning is expensive and data intensive for popular neural\narchitectures. We introduce the notion of amortizing invariance learning. In an\nup-front learning phase, we learn a low-dimensional manifold of feature\nextractors spanning invariance to different transformations using a\nhyper-network. Then, for any problem of interest, both model and invariance\nlearning are rapid and efficient by fitting a low-dimensional invariance\ndescriptor an output head. Empirically, this framework can identify appropriate\ninvariances in different downstream tasks and lead to comparable or better test\nperformance than conventional approaches. Our HyperInvariance framework is also\ntheoretically appealing as it enables generalisation-bounds that provide an\ninteresting new operating point in the trade-off between model fit and\ncomplexity.",

    "abstract": "Pre-trained language models have established the state-of-the-art on various\nnatural language processing tasks, including dialogue summarization, which\nallows the reader to quickly access key information from long conversations in\nmeetings, interviews or phone calls. However, such dialogues are still\ndifficult to handle with current models because the spontaneity of the language\ninvolves expressions that are rarely present in the corpora used for\npre-training the language models. Moreover, the vast majority of the work\naccomplished in this field has been focused on English. In this work, we\npresent a study on the summarization of spontaneous oral dialogues in French\nusing several language specific pre-trained models: BARThez, and BelGPT-2, as\nwell as multilingual pre-trained models: mBART, mBARThez, and mT5. Experiments\nwere performed on the DECODA (Call Center) dialogue corpus whose task is to\ngenerate abstractive synopses from call center conversations between a caller\nand one or several agents depending on the situation. Results show that the\nBARThez models offer the best performance far above the previous\nstate-of-the-art on DECODA.

    "abstract": "A recent breakthrough in Edmonds' problem showed that the noncommutative rank\ncan be computed in deterministic polynomial time, and various algorithms for it\nwere devised. However, only quite complicated algorithms are known for finding\na so-called shrunk subspace, which acts as a dual certificate for the value of\nthe noncommutative rank. In particular, the operator Sinkhorn algorithm,\nperhaps the simplest algorithm to compute the noncommutative rank with operator\nscaling, does not find a shrunk subspace. Finding a shrunk subspace plays a key\nrole in applications, such as separation in the Brascamp-Lieb polytope,\none-parameter subgroups in the null-cone membership problem, and primal-dual\nalgorithms for matroid intersection and fractional matroid matching.\nIn this paper, we provide a simple Sinkhorn-style algorithm to find the\nsmallest shrunk subspace over the complex field in deterministic polynomial\ntime. To this end, we introduce a generalization of the operator scaling\nproblem, where the spectra of the marginals must be majorized by specified\nvectors. Then we design an efficient Sinkhorn-style algorithm for the\ngeneralized operator scaling problem. Applying this to the shrunk subspace\nproblem, we show that a sufficiently long run of the algorithm also finds an\napproximate shrunk subspace close to the minimum exact shrunk subspace.\nFinally, we show that the approximate shrunk subspace can be rounded if it is\nsufficiently close. Along the way, we also provide a simple randomized\nalgorithm to find the smallest shrunk subspace.\nAs applications, we design a faster algorithm for fractional linear matroid\nmatching and efficient weak membership and optimization algorithms for the\nrank-2 Brascamp-Lieb polytope.",

    "abstract": "Surface defect detection is an extremely crucial step to ensure the quality\nof industrial products. Nowadays, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on\nencoder-decoder architecture have achieved tremendous success in various defect\ndetection tasks. However, due to the intrinsic locality of convolution, they\ncommonly exhibit a limitation in explicitly modeling long-range interactions,\ncritical for pixel-wise defect detection in complex cases, e.g., cluttered\nbackground and illegible pseudo-defects. Recent transformers are especially\nskilled at learning global image dependencies but with limited local structural\ninformation necessary for detailed defect location. To overcome the above\nlimitations, we propose an efficient hybrid transformer architecture, termed\nDefect Transformer (DefT), for surface defect detection, which incorporates CNN\nand transformer into a unified model to capture local and non-local\nrelationships collaboratively. Specifically, in the encoder module, a\nconvolutional stem block is firstly adopted to retain more detailed spatial\ninformation. Then, the patch aggregation blocks are used to generate\nmulti-scale representation with four hierarchies, each of them is followed by a\nseries of DefT blocks, which respectively include a locally position-aware\nblock for local position encoding, a lightweight multi-pooling self-attention\nto model multi-scale global contextual relationships with good computational\nefficiency, and a convolutional feed-forward network for feature transformation\nand further location information learning. Finally, a simple but effective\ndecoder module is proposed to gradually recover spatial details from the skip\nconnections in the encoder. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate\nthe superiority and efficiency of our method compared with other CNN- and\ntransformer-based networks.",

It has recently been understood that, even under this\nseemingly strong assumption and access to a generative model, worst-case sample\ncomplexities can be prohibitively (i.e., exponentially) large. We investigate\nthe setting where the learner additionally has access to interactive\ndemonstrations from an expert policy, and we present a statistically and\ncomputationally efficient algorithm (Delphi) for blending exploration with\nexpert queries. In particular, Delphi requires $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d)$ expert\nqueries and a $\\texttt{poly}(d,H,|\\mathcal{A}|,1/\\varepsilon)$ amount of\nexploratory samples to provably recover an $\\varepsilon$-suboptimal policy.\nCompared to pure RL approaches, this corresponds to an exponential improvement\nin sample complexity with surprisingly-little expert input.

    "abstract": "This paper presents techniques to display 3D illuminations using Flying Light\nSpecks, FLSs. Each FLS is a miniature (hundreds of micrometers) sized drone\nwith one or more light sources to generate different colors and textures with\nadjustable brightness. It is network enabled with a processor and local\nstorage. Synchronized swarms of cooperating FLSs render illumination of virtual\nobjects in a pre-specified 3D volume, an FLS display. We present techniques to\ndisplay both static and motion illuminations. Our display techniques consider\nthe limited flight time of an FLS on a fully charged battery and the duration\nof time to charge the FLS battery. Moreover, our techniques assume failure of\nFLSs is the norm rather than an exception. We present a hardware and a software\narchitecture for an FLS-display along with a family of techniques to compute\nflight paths of FLSs for illuminations. With motion illuminations, one\ntechnique (ICF) minimizes the overall distance traveled by the FLSs\nsignificantly when compared with the other techniques.",

Our\nalgorithms are based on a regularized exponential mechanism which samples from\nthe density $\\propto \\exp(-k(F+\\mu r))$ where $F$ is the empirical loss and $r$\nis a regularizer which is strongly convex with respect to $\\normx{\\cdot}$,\ngeneralizing a recent work of \\cite{GLL22} to non-Euclidean settings.

    "abstract": "Image-adaptive lookup tables (LUTs) have achieved great success in real-time\nimage enhancement tasks due to their high efficiency for modeling color\ntransforms. However, they embed the complete transform, including the color\ncomponent-independent and the component-correlated parts, into only a single\ntype of LUTs, either 1D or 3D, in a coupled manner. This scheme raises a\ndilemma of improving model expressiveness or efficiency due to two factors. On\nthe one hand, the 1D LUTs provide high computational efficiency but lack the\ncritical capability of color components interaction. On the other, the 3D LUTs\npresent enhanced component-correlated transform capability but suffer from\nheavy memory footprint, high training difficulty, and limited cell utilization.\nInspired by the conventional divide-and-conquer practice in the image signal\nprocessor, we present SepLUT (separable image-adaptive lookup table) to tackle\nthe above limitations. Specifically, we separate a single color transform into\na cascade of component-independent and component-correlated sub-transforms\ninstantiated as 1D and 3D LUTs, respectively. In this way, the capabilities of\ntwo sub-transforms can facilitate each other, where the 3D LUT complements the\nability to mix up color components, and the 1D LUT redistributes the input\ncolors to increase the cell utilization of the 3D LUT and thus enable the use\nof a more lightweight 3D LUT.

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD), which can efficiently transfer knowledge from a\ncumbersome network (teacher) to a compact network (student), has demonstrated\nits advantages in some computer vision applications. The representation of\nknowledge is vital for knowledge transferring and student learning, which is\ngenerally defined in hand-crafted manners or uses the intermediate features\ndirectly. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic meta knowledge\ndistillation method under the teacher-student architecture for the single image\nsuper-resolution task. It provides a more flexible and accurate way to help the\nteachers transmit knowledge in accordance with the abilities of students via\nknowledge representation networks (KRNets) with learnable parameters. In order\nto improve the perception ability of knowledge representation to students'\nrequirements, we propose to solve the transformation process from intermediate\noutputs to transferred knowledge by employing the student features and the\ncorrelation between teacher and student in the KRNets. Specifically, the\ntexture-aware dynamic kernels are generated and then extract texture features\nto be improved and the corresponding teacher guidance so as to decompose the\ndistillation problem into texture-wise supervision for further promoting the\nrecovery quality of high-frequency details. In addition, the KRNets are\noptimized in a meta-learning manner to ensure the knowledge transferring and\nthe student learning are beneficial to improving the reconstructed quality of\nthe student. Experiments conducted on various single image super-resolution\ndatasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing defined\nknowledge representation related distillation methods, and can help\nsuper-resolution algorithms achieve better reconstruction quality without\nintroducing any inference complexity.",

    "abstract": "Alongside the rapid development of data collection and analysis techniques in\nrecent years, there is increasingly an emphasis on the need to address\ninformation leakage associated with such usage of data. To this end, much work\nin the privacy literature is devoted to the protection of individual users and\ncontributors of data. However, some situations instead require a different\nnotion of data confidentiality involving global properties aggregated over the\nrecords of a dataset. Such notions of information protection are particularly\napplicable for business and organization data, where global properties may\nreflect trade secrets, or demographic data, which can be harmful if mishandled.\nRecent work on property inference attacks furthermore shows how data analysis\nalgorithms can be susceptible to leaking these global properties of data,\nhighlighting the importance of developing mechanisms that can protect such\ninformation.\nIn this work, we demonstrate how a distribution privacy framework can be\napplied to formalize the problem of protecting global properties of datasets.\nGiven this framework, we investigate several mechanisms and their tradeoffs for\nproviding this notion of data confidentiality. We analyze the theoretical\nprotection guarantees offered by these mechanisms under various data\nassumptions, then implement and empirically evaluate these mechanisms for\nseveral data analysis tasks.

Nevertheless, causality analysis is\npractically challenging, particularly due to limited observability. Recently,\nchaos engineering has been applied to test complex real-world software systems.\nChaos frameworks like Chaos Mesh mutate a set of chaos variables to inject\ncatastrophic events (e.g., network slowdowns) to \"stress\" software systems. The\nsystems under chaos stress are then tested using methods like differential\ntesting to check if they retain their normal functionality (e.g., SQL query\noutput is always correct under stress). Despite its ubiquity in the industry,\nchaos engineering is now employed mostly to aid software testing rather for\nperformance debugging.\nThis paper identifies novel usage of chaos engineering on helping developers\ndiagnose performance anomalies in databases. Our presented framework, PERFCE,\ncomprises an offline phase and an online phase. The offline phase learns the\nstatistical models of the target database system, whilst the online phase\ndiagnoses the root cause of monitored performance anomalies on the fly. During\nthe offline phase, PERFCE leverages both passive observations and proactive\nchaos experiments to constitute accurate causal graphs and structural equation\nmodels (SEMs). When observing performance anomalies during the online phase,\ncausal graphs enable qualitative root cause identification (e.g., high CPU\nusage) and SEMs enable quantitative counterfactual analysis (e.g., determining\n\"when CPU usage is reduced to 45\\%, performance returns to normal\").

    "abstract": "One of the main challenges in developing racetrack memory systems is the\nlimited precision in controlling the track shifts, that in turn affects the\nreliability of reading and writing the data. A current proposal for combating\ndeletions in racetrack memories is to use redundant heads per-track resulting\nin multiple copies (potentially erroneous) and recovering the data by solving a\nspecialized version of a sequence reconstruction problem. Using this approach,\n$k$-deletion correcting codes of length $n$, with $d \\ge 2$ heads per-track,\nwith redundancy $\\log \\log n + 4$ were constructed. However, the known approach\nrequires that $k \\le d$, namely, that the number of heads ($d$) is larger than\nor equal to the number of correctable deletions ($k$). Here we address the\nquestion: What is the best redundancy that can be achieved for a $k$-deletion\ncode ($k$ is a constant) if the number of heads is fixed at $d$ (due to\nimplementation constraints)? One of our key results is an answer to this\nquestion, namely, we construct codes that can correct $k$ deletions, for any\n$k$ beyond the known limit of $d$. The code has $4k \\log \\log n+o(\\log \\log n)$\nredundancy for $k \\le 2d-1$. In addition, when $k \\ge 2d$, our codes have $2\n\\lfloor k/d\\rfloor \\log n+o(\\log n)$ redundancy, that we prove it is order-wise\noptimal, specifically, we prove that the redundancy required for correcting $k$\ndeletions is at least $\\lfloor k/d\\rfloor \\log n+o(\\log n)$. The\nencoding/decoding complexity of our codes is $O(n\\log^{2k}n)$. Finally, we ask\na general question: What is the optimal redundancy for codes correcting a\ncombination of at most $k$ deletions and insertions in a $d$-head racetrack\nmemory? We prove that the redundancy sufficient to correct a combination of $k$\ndeletion and insertion errors is similar to the case of $k$ deletion errors.",

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning (CL) has recently been applied to adversarial learning\ntasks. Such practice considers adversarial samples as additional positive views\nof an instance, and by maximizing their agreements with each other, yields\nbetter adversarial robustness. However, this mechanism can be potentially\nflawed, since adversarial perturbations may cause instance-level identity\nconfusion, which can impede CL performance by pulling together different\ninstances with separate identities. To address this issue, we propose to treat\nadversarial samples unequally when contrasted, with an asymmetric InfoNCE\nobjective ($A-InfoNCE$) that allows discriminating considerations of\nadversarial samples. Specifically, adversaries are viewed as inferior positives\nthat induce weaker learning signals, or as hard negatives exhibiting higher\ncontrast to other negative samples. In the asymmetric fashion, the adverse\nimpacts of conflicting objectives between CL and adversarial learning can be\neffectively mitigated.

    "abstract": "The spread of digital disinformation (aka \"fake news\") is arguably one of the\nmost significant threats on the Internet which can cause individual and\nsocietal harm of large scales. The susceptibility to fake news attacks hinges\non whether Internet users perceive a fake news article/snippet to be legitimate\nafter reading it. In this paper, we attempt to garner an in-depth understanding\nof users' susceptibility to text-centric fake news attacks via a\nneuro-cognitive methodology. We investigate the neural underpinnings relevant\nto fake/real news through EEG. We run an experiment with human users to pursue\na thorough investigation of users' perception and cognitive processing of\nfake/real news. We analyze the neural activity associated with the fake/real\nnews detection task for different categories of news articles. Our results show\nthere may be no statistically significant or automatically inferable\ndifferences in the way the human brain processes the fake vs. real news, while\nmarked differences are observed when people are subject to (real/fake) news vs.\nresting state and even between some different categories of fake news. This\nneuro-cognitive finding may help to justify users' susceptibility to fake news\nattacks, as also confirmed from the behavioral analysis. In other words, the\nfake news articles may seem almost indistinguishable from the real news\narticles in both behavioral and neural domains. Our work serves to dissect the\nfundamental neural phenomena underlying fake news attacks and explains users'\nsusceptibility to these attacks through the limits of human biology. We believe\nthis could be a notable insight for the researchers and practitioners\nsuggesting the human detection of fake news might be ineffective, which may\nalso have an adverse impact on the design of automated detection approaches\nthat crucially rely upon human labeling of text articles for building training\nmodels",

Furthermore, due to ignoring\nthe inner distribution of the graph nodes, the decision layer might lead to an\nunsatisfactory performance in semi-supervised learning with less label support.\nTo address the referred issues, we propose a novel graph deep model with a\nnon-gradient decision layer for graph mining. Firstly, manifold learning is\nunified with label local-structure preservation to capture the topological\ninformation of the nodes. Moreover, owing to the non-gradient property,\nclosed-form solutions is achieved to be employed as the decision layer for GCN.\nParticularly, a joint optimization method is designed for this graph model,\nwhich extremely accelerates the convergence of the model.

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has attracted much attention in automated\ngame testing. Early attempts rely on game internal information for game space\nexploration, thus requiring deep integration with games, which is inconvenient\nfor practical applications. In this work, we propose using only\nscreenshots/pixels as input for automated game testing and build a general game\ntesting agent, Inspector, that can be easily applied to different games without\ndeep integration with games. In addition to covering all game space for\ntesting, our agent tries to take human-like behaviors to interact with key\nobjects in a game, since some bugs usually happen in player-object\ninteractions. Inspector is based on purely pixel inputs and comprises three key\nmodules: game space explorer, key object detector, and human-like object\ninvestigator. Game space explorer aims to explore the whole game space by using\na curiosity-based reward function with pixel inputs. Key object detector aims\nto detect key objects in a game, based on a small number of labeled\nscreenshots. Human-like object investigator aims to mimic human behaviors for\ninvestigating key objects via imitation learning. We conduct experiments on two\npopular video games: Shooter Game and Action RPG Game. Experiment results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of Inspector in exploring game space, detecting\nkey objects, and investigating objects. Moreover, Inspector successfully\ndiscovers two potential bugs in those two games. The demo video of Inspector is\navailable at https://github.com/Inspector-GameTesting/Inspector-GameTesting.",

    "abstract": "Weakly supervised Referring Expression Grounding (REG) aims to ground a\nparticular target in an image described by a language expression while lacking\nthe correspondence between target and expression. Two main problems exist in\nweakly supervised REG. First, the lack of region-level annotations introduces\nambiguities between proposals and queries. Second, most previous weakly\nsupervised REG methods ignore the discriminative location and context of the\nreferent, causing difficulties in distinguishing the target from other\nsame-category objects. To address the above challenges, we design an\nentity-enhanced adaptive reconstruction network (EARN). Specifically, EARN\nincludes three modules: entity enhancement, adaptive grounding, and\ncollaborative reconstruction. In entity enhancement, we calculate semantic\nsimilarity as supervision to select the candidate proposals. Adaptive grounding\ncalculates the ranking score of candidate proposals upon subject, location and\ncontext with hierarchical attention. Collaborative reconstruction measures the\nranking result from three perspectives: adaptive reconstruction, language\nreconstruction and attribute classification. The adaptive mechanism helps to\nalleviate the variance of different referring expressions. Experiments on five\ndatasets show EARN outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Cloth-changing person reidentification (ReID) is a newly emerging research\ntopic that aims to retrieve pedestrians whose clothes are changed. Since the\nhuman appearance with different clothes exhibits large variations, it is very\ndifficult for existing approaches to extract discriminative and robust feature\nrepresentations. Current works mainly focus on body shape or contour sketches,\nbut the human semantic information and the potential consistency of pedestrian\nfeatures before and after changing clothes are not fully explored or are\nignored. To solve these issues, in this work, a novel semantic-aware attention\nand visual shielding network for cloth-changing person ReID (abbreviated as\nSAVS) is proposed where the key idea is to shield clues related to the\nappearance of clothes and only focus on visual semantic information that is not\nsensitive to view/posture changes. Specifically, a visual semantic encoder is\nfirst employed to locate the human body and clothing regions based on human\nsemantic segmentation information. Then, a human semantic attention module\n(HSA) is proposed to highlight the human semantic information and reweight the\nvisual feature map. In addition, a visual clothes shielding module (VCS) is\nalso designed to extract a more robust feature representation for the\ncloth-changing task by covering the clothing regions and focusing the model on\nthe visual semantic information unrelated to the clothes. Most importantly,\nthese two modules are jointly explored in an end-to-end unified framework.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly\noutperform state-of-the-art methods, and more robust features can be extracted\nfor cloth-changing persons. Compared with FSAM (published in CVPR 2021), this\nmethod can achieve improvements of 32.7% (16.5%) and 14.9% (-) on the LTCC and\nPRCC datasets in terms of mAP (rank-1), respectively.",

MLGO was among the\nfirst of such projects and it only strives to reduce the code size of a binary\nwith an ML-based Inliner using Reinforcement Learning.\nThis paper presents MLGOPerf; the first end-to-end framework capable of\noptimizing performance using LLVM's ML-Inliner.

It does so by predicting\nthe post-inlining speedup of a function under analysis and it enables a fast\ntraining framework for the primary model which otherwise wouldn't be practical.\nThe experimental results show MLGOPerf is able to gain up to 1.8% and 2.2% with\nrespect to LLVM's optimization at O3 when trained for performance on SPEC\nCPU2006 and Cbench benchmarks, respectively.

    "abstract": "Prompt tuning has been an extremely effective tool to adapt a pre-trained\nmodel to downstream tasks. However, standard prompt-based methods mainly\nconsider the case of sufficient data of downstream tasks. It is still unclear\nwhether the advantage can be transferred to the few-shot regime, where only\nlimited data are available for each downstream task. Although some works have\ndemonstrated the potential of prompt-tuning under the few-shot setting, the\nmain stream methods via searching discrete prompts or tuning soft prompts with\nlimited data are still very challenging. Through extensive empirical studies,\nwe find that there is still a gap between prompt tuning and fully fine-tuning\nfor few-shot learning. To bridge the gap, we propose a new prompt-tuning\nframework, called Soft Template Tuning (STT). STT combines manual and auto\nprompts, and treats downstream classification tasks as a masked language\nmodeling task. Comprehensive evaluation on different settings suggests STT can\nclose the gap between fine-tuning and prompt-based methods without introducing\nadditional parameters.

    "abstract": "CutMix is a popular augmentation technique commonly used for training modern\nconvolutional and transformer vision networks. It was originally designed to\nencourage Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) to focus more on an image's global\ncontext instead of local information, which greatly improves the performance of\nCNNs. However, we found it to have limited benefits for transformer-based\narchitectures that naturally have a global receptive field. In this paper, we\npropose a novel data augmentation technique TokenMix to improve the performance\nof vision transformers. TokenMix mixes two images at token level via\npartitioning the mixing region into multiple separated parts. Besides, we show\nthat the mixed learning target in CutMix, a linear combination of a pair of the\nground truth labels, might be inaccurate and sometimes counter-intuitive. To\nobtain a more suitable target, we propose to assign the target score according\nto the content-based neural activation maps of the two images from a\npre-trained teacher model, which does not need to have high performance. With\nplenty of experiments on various vision transformer architectures, we show that\nour proposed TokenMix helps vision transformers focus on the foreground area to\ninfer the classes and enhances their robustness to occlusion, with consistent\nperformance gains. Notably, we improve DeiT-T/S/B with +1% ImageNet top-1\naccuracy. Besides, TokenMix enjoys longer training, which achieves 81.2% top-1\naccuracy on ImageNet with DeiT-S trained for 400 epochs.

Most\nexisting image matching approaches follow a one-to-one assignment principle and\nemploy mutual nearest neighbor to guarantee unique correspondence between local\nfeatures across images. However, images from different conditions may hold\nlarge-scale variations or viewpoint diversification so that one-to-one\nassignment may cause ambiguous or missing representations in dense matching. In\nthis paper, we introduce AdaMatcher, a novel detector-free local feature\nmatching method, which first correlates dense features by a lightweight feature\ninteraction module and estimates co-visible area of the paired images, then\nperforms a patch-level many-to-one assignment to predict match proposals, and\nfinally refines them based on a one-to-one refinement module.

    "abstract": "In the field of source code processing, the transformer-based representation\nmodels have shown great powerfulness and have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nperformance in many tasks. Although the transformer models process the\nsequential source code, pieces of evidence show that they may capture the\nstructural information (\\eg, in the syntax tree, data flow, control flow, \\etc)\nas well. We propose the aggregated attention score, a method to investigate the\nstructural information learned by the transformer. We also put forward the\naggregated attention graph, a new way to extract program graphs from the\npre-trained models automatically. We measure our methods from multiple\nperspectives. Furthermore, based on our empirical findings, we use the\nautomatically extracted graphs to replace those ingenious manual designed\ngraphs in the Variable Misuse task. Experimental results show that the semantic\ngraphs we extracted automatically are greatly meaningful and effective, which\nprovide a new perspective for us to understand and use the information\ncontained in the model.",

Most of the previous methods\ndirectly extract and fuse the motion and appearance features for segmenting\ntarget objects in the UVOS setting. However, optical flow is intrinsically an\ninstantaneous velocity of all pixels among consecutive frames, thus making the\nmotion features not aligned well with the primary objects among the\ncorresponding frames. To solve the above challenge, we propose a concise,\npractical, and efficient architecture for appearance and motion feature\nalignment, dubbed hierarchical feature alignment network (HFAN). Specifically,\nthe key merits in HFAN are the sequential Feature AlignMent (FAM) module and\nthe Feature AdaptaTion (FAT) module, which are leveraged for processing the\nappearance and motion features hierarchically. FAM is capable of aligning both\nappearance and motion features with the primary object semantic\nrepresentations, respectively. Further, FAT is explicitly designed for the\nadaptive fusion of appearance and motion features to achieve a desirable\ntrade-off between cross-modal features.

However, its applications\nhave been limited by security concerns due to various adversarial attacks, such\nas poisoning attacks (model and data poisoning). Such attacks attempt to poison\nthe local models and data to manipulate the global models in order to obtain\nundue benefits and malicious use. Traditional methods of data auditing to\nmitigate poisoning attacks find their limited applications in FL because the\nedge devices never share their raw data directly due to privacy concerns, and\nare globally distributed with no insight into their training data. Thereafter,\nit is challenging to develop appropriate strategies to address such attacks and\nminimize their impact on the global model in federated learning. In order to\naddress such challenges in FL, we proposed a novel framework to detect\npoisoning attacks using deep neural networks and support vector machines, in\nthe form of anomaly without acquiring any direct access or information about\nthe underlying training data of local edge devices. We illustrate and evaluate\nthe proposed framework using different state of art poisoning attacks for two\ndifferent healthcare applications: Electrocardiograph classification and human\nactivity recognition.

Advanced VSR models, including the latest VSR\nTransformers, are generally equipped with well-designed alignment modules.\nHowever, the progress of the self-attention mechanism may violate this common\nsense. In this paper, we rethink the role of alignment in VSR Transformers and\nmake several counter-intuitive observations. Our experiments show that: (i) VSR\nTransformers can directly utilize multi-frame information from unaligned\nvideos, and (ii) existing alignment methods are sometimes harmful to VSR\nTransformers. These observations indicate that we can further improve the\nperformance of VSR Transformers simply by removing the alignment module and\nadopting a larger attention window. Nevertheless, such designs will\ndramatically increase the computational burden, and cannot deal with large\nmotions. Therefore, we propose a new and efficient alignment method called\npatch alignment, which aligns image patches instead of pixels.

    "title": "DID-M3D: Decoupling Instance Depth for Monocular 3D Object Detection",
    "abstract": "Monocular 3D detection has drawn much attention from the community due to its\nlow cost and setup simplicity. It takes an RGB image as input and predicts 3D\nboxes in the 3D space. The most challenging sub-task lies in the instance depth\nestimation. Previous works usually use a direct estimation method. However, in\nthis paper we point out that the instance depth on the RGB image is\nnon-intuitive. It is coupled by visual depth clues and instance attribute\nclues, making it hard to be directly learned in the network. Therefore, we\npropose to reformulate the instance depth to the combination of the instance\nvisual surface depth (visual depth) and the instance attribute depth (attribute\ndepth). The visual depth is related to objects' appearances and positions on\nthe image. By contrast, the attribute depth relies on objects' inherent\nattributes, which are invariant to the object affine transformation on the\nimage. Correspondingly, we decouple the 3D location uncertainty into visual\ndepth uncertainty and attribute depth uncertainty. By combining different types\nof depths and associated uncertainties, we can obtain the final instance depth.\nFurthermore, data augmentation in monocular 3D detection is usually limited due\nto the physical nature, hindering the boost of performance. Based on the\nproposed instance depth disentanglement strategy, we can alleviate this\nproblem. Evaluated on KITTI, our method achieves new state-of-the-art results,\nand extensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each component in\nour method.

    "title": "BrainCog: A Spiking Neural Network based Brain-inspired Cognitive  Intelligence Engine for Brain-inspired AI and Brain Simulation",
    "abstract": "Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have attracted extensive attentions in\nBrain-inspired Artificial Intelligence and computational neuroscience. They can\nbe used to simulate biological information processing in the brain at multiple\nscales. More importantly, SNNs serve as an appropriate level of abstraction to\nbring inspirations from brain and cognition to Artificial Intelligence. In this\npaper, we present the Brain-inspired Cognitive Intelligence Engine (BrainCog)\nfor creating brain-inspired AI and brain simulation models. BrainCog\nincorporates different types of spiking neuron models, learning rules, brain\nareas, etc., as essential modules provided by the platform. Based on these\neasy-to-use modules, BrainCog supports various brain-inspired cognitive\nfunctions, including Perception and Learning, Decision Making, Knowledge\nRepresentation and Reasoning, Motor Control, and Social Cognition. These\nbrain-inspired AI models have been effectively validated on various supervised,\nunsupervised, and reinforcement learning tasks, and they can be used to enable\nAI models to be with multiple brain-inspired cognitive functions. For brain\nsimulation, BrainCog realizes the function simulation of decision-making,\nworking memory, the structure simulation of the Neural Circuit, and whole brain\nstructure simulation of Mouse brain, Macaque brain, and Human brain. An AI\nengine named BORN is developed based on BrainCog, and it demonstrates how the\ncomponents of BrainCog can be integrated and used to build AI models and\napplications. To enable the scientific quest to decode the nature of biological\nintelligence and create AI, BrainCog aims to provide essential and easy-to-use\nbuilding blocks, and infrastructural support to develop brain-inspired spiking\nneural network based AI, and to simulate the cognitive brains at multiple\nscales.

    "abstract": "Background - Social anxiety (SA) is a common and debilitating condition,\nnegatively affecting life quality even at sub-diagnostic thresholds. We sought\nto characterize SA's acoustic signature using hypothesis-testing and machine\nlearning (ML) approaches. Methods - Participants formed spontaneous utterances\nresponding to instructions to refuse or consent to commands of alleged peers.\nVocal properties (e.g., intensity and duration) of these utterances were\nanalyzed. Results - Our prediction that, as compared to low-SA (n=31), high-SA\n(n=32) individuals exhibit a less confident vocal speech signature, especially\nwith respect to refusal utterances, was only partially supported by the\nclassical hypothesis-testing approach. However, the results of the ML analyses\nand specifically the decision tree classifier were consistent with such speech\npatterns in SA. Using a Gaussian Process (GP) classifier, we were able to\ndistinguish between high- and low-SA individuals with high (75.6%) accuracy and\ngood (.83 AUC) separability. We also expected and found that vocal properties\ndifferentiated between refusal and consent utterances. Conclusions - Our\nfindings provide further support for the usefulness of ML approach for the\nstudy of psychopathology, highlighting the utility of developing automatic\ntechniques to create behavioral markers of SAD.

Further, temporal fusion\nis also introduced in BEV representation and gains great success.

The unified fusion could\nnot only provide a new perspective on BEV fusion but also brings new\ncapabilities. With the proposed unified spatial-temporal fusion, our method\ncould support long-range fusion, which is hard to achieve in conventional BEV\nmethods. Moreover, the BEV fusion in our work is temporal-adaptive, and the\nweights of temporal fusion are learnable. In contrast, conventional methods\nmainly use fixed and equal weights for temporal fusion. Besides, the proposed\nunified fusion could avoid information lost in conventional BEV fusion methods\nand make full use of features.

    "abstract": "Variance reduction techniques such as SPIDER/SARAH/STORM have been\nextensively studied to improve the convergence rates of stochastic non-convex\noptimization, which usually maintain and update a sequence of estimators for a\nsingle function across iterations. {\\it What if we need to track multiple\nfunctional mappings across iterations but only with access to stochastic\nsamples of $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ functional mappings at each iteration?} There is an\nimportant application in solving an emerging family of coupled compositional\noptimization problems in the form of $\\sum_{i=1}^m f_i(g_i(\\mathbf{w}))$, where\n$g_i$ is accessible through a stochastic oracle. The key issue is to track and\nestimate a sequence of $\\mathbf g(\\mathbf{w})=(g_1(\\mathbf{w}), \\ldots,\ng_m(\\mathbf{w}))$ across iterations, where $\\mathbf g(\\mathbf{w})$ has $m$\nblocks and it is only allowed to probe $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ blocks to attain their\nstochastic values and Jacobians. To improve the complexity for solving these\nproblems, we propose a novel stochastic method named Multi-block-Single-probe\nVariance Reduced (MSVR) estimator to track the sequence of $\\mathbf\ng(\\mathbf{w})$. It is inspired by STORM but introduces a customized error\ncorrection term to alleviate the noise not only in stochastic samples for the\nselected blocks but also in those blocks that are not sampled. With the help of\nthe MSVR estimator, we develop several algorithms for solving the\naforementioned compositional problems with improved complexities across a\nspectrum of settings with non-convex/convex/strongly convex objectives.

    "abstract": "Research into Few-shot Semantic Segmentation (FSS) has attracted great\nattention, with the goal to segment target objects in a query image given only\na few annotated support images of the target class. A key to this challenging\ntask is to fully utilize the information in the support images by exploiting\nfine-grained correlations between the query and support images. However, most\nexisting approaches either compressed the support information into a few\nclass-wise prototypes, or used partial support information (e.g., only\nforeground) at the pixel level, causing non-negligible information loss. In\nthis paper, we propose Dense pixel-wise Cross-query-and-support Attention\nweighted Mask Aggregation (DCAMA), where both foreground and background support\ninformation are fully exploited via multi-level pixel-wise correlations between\npaired query and support features. Implemented with the scaled dot-product\nattention in the Transformer architecture, DCAMA treats every query pixel as a\ntoken, computes its similarities with all support pixels, and predicts its\nsegmentation label as an additive aggregation of all the support pixels' labels\n-- weighted by the similarities. Based on the unique formulation of DCAMA, we\nfurther propose efficient and effective one-pass inference for n-shot\nsegmentation, where pixels of all support images are collected for the mask\naggregation at once. Experiments show that our DCAMA significantly advances the\nstate of the art on standard FSS benchmarks of PASCAL-5i, COCO-20i, and\nFSS-1000, e.g., with 3.1%, 9.7%, and 3.6% absolute improvements in 1-shot mIoU\nover previous best records.

Our objective is the minimization of the sum of the completion\ntimes of all jobs.

We\napply competitive analysis to evaluate our algorithms.\nWe improve 25-year-old lower bounds for the competitive ratio of this problem\nby optimizing a simple job pattern.

    "abstract": "Self-driving cars (SDC) commonly implement the perception pipeline to detect\nthe surrounding obstacles and track their moving trajectories, which lays the\nground for the subsequent driving decision making process. Although the\nsecurity of obstacle detection in SDC is intensively studied, not until very\nrecently the attackers start to exploit the vulnerability of the tracking\nmodule. Compared with solely attacking the object detectors, this new attack\nstrategy influences the driving decision more effectively with less attack\nbudgets. However, little is known on whether the revealed vulnerability remains\neffective in end-to-end self-driving systems and, if so, how to mitigate the\nthreat.\nIn this paper, we present the first systematic research on the security of\nobject tracking in SDC. Through a comprehensive case study on the full\nperception pipeline of a popular open-sourced self-driving system, Baidu's\nApollo, we prove the mainstream multi-object tracker (MOT) based on Kalman\nFilter (KF) is unsafe even with an enabled multi-sensor fusion mechanism. Our\nroot cause analysis reveals, the vulnerability is innate to the design of\nKF-based MOT, which shall error-handle the prediction results from the object\ndetectors yet the adopted KF algorithm is prone to trust the observation more\nwhen its deviation from the prediction is larger. To address this design flaw,\nwe propose a simple yet effective security patch for KF-based MOT, the core of\nwhich is an adaptive strategy to balance the focus of KF on observations and\npredictions according to the anomaly index of the observation-prediction\ndeviation, and has certified effectiveness against a generalized hijacking\nattack model. Extensive evaluation on $4$ KF-based existing MOT implementations\n(including 2D and 3D, academic and Apollo ones) validate the defense\neffectiveness and the trivial performance overhead of our approach.",

    "abstract": "Vision Transformer are very popular nowadays due to their state-of-the-art\nperformance in several computer vision tasks, such as image classification and\naction recognition. Although the performance of Vision Transformers have been\ngreatly improved by employing Convolutional Neural Networks, hierarchical\nstructures and compact forms, there is limited research on ways to utilize\nadditional data representations to refine the attention map derived from the\nmulti-head attention of a Transformer network. This work proposes a novel\nattention mechanism, called multi-manifold attention, that can substitute any\nstandard attention mechanism in a Transformer-based network. The proposed\nattention models the input space in three distinct manifolds, namely Euclidean,\nSymmetric Positive Definite and Grassmann, with different statistical and\ngeometrical properties, guiding the network to take into consideration a rich\nset of information that describe the appearance, color and texture of an image,\nfor the computation of a highly descriptive attention map. In this way, a\nVision Transformer with the proposed attention is guided to become more\nattentive towards discriminative features, leading to improved classification\nresults, as shown by the experimental results on several well-known image\nclassification datasets.",

    "abstract": "Self-triggered control, a well-documented technique for reducing the\ncommunication overhead while ensuring desired system performance, is gaining\nincreasing popularity. However, existing methods for self-triggered control\nrequire explicit system models that are assumed perfectly known a priori. An\nend-to-end control paradigm known as data-driven control learns control laws\ndirectly from data, and offers a competing alternative to the routine system\nidentification-then-control method. In this context, the present paper puts\nforth data-driven self-triggered control schemes for unknown linear systems\nusing data collected offline. Specifically, for output feedback control\nsystems, a data-driven model predictive control (MPC) scheme is proposed, which\ncomputes a sequence of control inputs while generating a predicted system\ntrajectory. A data-driven self-triggering law is designed using the predicted\ntrajectory, to determine the next triggering time once a new measurement\nbecomes available. For state feedback control systems, instead of capitalizing\non MPC to predict the trajectory, a data-fitting problem using the\npre-collected input-state data is solved, whose solution is employed to\nconstruct the self-triggering mechanism. Both feasibility and stability are\nestablished for the proposed self-triggered controllers, which are validated\nusing numerical examples.",

    "abstract": "Learning expressive molecular representations is crucial to facilitate the\naccurate prediction of molecular properties. Despite the significant\nadvancement of graph neural networks (GNNs) in molecular representation\nlearning, they generally face limitations such as neighbors-explosion,\nunder-reaching, over-smoothing, and over-squashing. Also, GNNs usually have\nhigh computational complexity because of the large-scale number of parameters.\nTypically, such limitations emerge or increase when facing relatively\nlarge-size graphs or using a deeper GNN model architecture. An idea to overcome\nthese problems is to simplify a molecular graph into a small, rich, and\ninformative one, which is more efficient and less challenging to train GNNs. To\nthis end, we propose a novel molecular graph coarsening framework named FunQG\nutilizing Functional groups, as influential building blocks of a molecule to\ndetermine its properties, based on a graph-theoretic concept called Quotient\nGraph. By experiments, we show that the resulting informative graphs are much\nsmaller than the molecular graphs and thus are good candidates for training\nGNNs. We apply the FunQG on popular molecular property prediction benchmarks\nand then compare the performance of a GNN architecture on the obtained datasets\nwith several state-of-the-art baselines on the original datasets. By\nexperiments, this method significantly outperforms previous baselines on\nvarious datasets, besides its dramatic reduction in the number of parameters\nand low computational complexity. Therefore, the FunQG can be used as a simple,\ncost-effective, and robust method for solving the molecular representation\nlearning problem.",

    "abstract": "Dense video captioning aims to generate corresponding text descriptions for a\nseries of events in the untrimmed video, which can be divided into two\nsub-tasks, event detection and event captioning. Unlike previous works that\ntackle the two sub-tasks separately, recent works have focused on enhancing the\ninter-task association between the two sub-tasks. However, designing inter-task\ninteractions for event detection and captioning is not trivial due to the large\ndifferences in their task specific solutions. Besides, previous event detection\nmethods normally ignore temporal dependencies between events, leading to event\nredundancy or inconsistency problems. To tackle above the two defects, in this\npaper, we define event detection as a sequence generation task and propose a\nunified pre-training and fine-tuning framework to naturally enhance the\ninter-task association between event detection and captioning. Since the model\npredicts each event with previous events as context, the inter-dependency\nbetween events is fully exploited and thus our model can detect more diverse\nand consistent events in the video. Experiments on the ActivityNet dataset show\nthat our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, and can be further\nboosted when pre-trained on extra large-scale video-text data.

    "title": "Comprehensive Graph Gradual Pruning for Sparse Training in Graph Neural  Networks",
    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) tend to suffer from high computation costs due\nto the exponentially increasing scale of graph data and the number of model\nparameters, which restricts their utility in practical applications. To this\nend, some recent works focus on sparsifying GNNs with the lottery ticket\nhypothesis (LTH) to reduce inference costs while maintaining performance\nlevels. However, the LTH-based methods suffer from two major drawbacks: 1) they\nrequire exhaustive and iterative training of dense models, resulting in an\nextremely large training computation cost, and 2) they only trim graph\nstructures and model parameters but ignore the node feature dimension, where\nsignificant redundancy exists. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a\ncomprehensive graph gradual pruning framework termed CGP. This is achieved by\ndesigning a during-training graph pruning paradigm to dynamically prune GNNs\nwithin one training process. Unlike LTH-based methods, the proposed CGP\napproach requires no re-training, which significantly reduces the computation\ncosts. Furthermore, we design a co-sparsifying strategy to comprehensively trim\nall three core elements of GNNs: graph structures, node features, and model\nparameters. Meanwhile, aiming at refining the pruning operation, we introduce a\nregrowth process into our CGP framework, in order to re-establish the pruned\nbut important connections. The proposed CGP is evaluated by using a node\nclassification task across 6 GNN architectures, including shallow models (GCN\nand GAT), shallow-but-deep-propagation models (SGC and APPNP), and deep models\n(GCNII and ResGCN), on a total of 14 real-world graph datasets, including\nlarge-scale graph datasets from the challenging Open Graph Benchmark.\nExperiments reveal that our proposed strategy greatly improves both training\nand inference efficiency while matching or even exceeding the accuracy of\nexisting methods.",

    "abstract": "Data-Efficient GANs (DE-GANs), which aim to learn generative models with a\nlimited amount of training data, encounter several challenges for generating\nhigh-quality samples. Since data augmentation strategies have largely\nalleviated the training instability, how to further improve the generative\nperformance of DE-GANs becomes a hotspot. Recently, contrastive learning has\nshown the great potential of increasing the synthesis quality of DE-GANs, yet\nrelated principles are not well explored. In this paper, we revisit and compare\ndifferent contrastive learning strategies in DE-GANs, and identify (i) the\ncurrent bottleneck of generative performance is the discontinuity of latent\nspace; (ii) compared to other contrastive learning strategies,\nInstance-perturbation works towards latent space continuity, which brings the\nmajor improvement to DE-GANs. Based on these observations, we propose FakeCLR,\nwhich only applies contrastive learning on perturbed fake samples, and devises\nthree related training techniques: Noise-related Latent Augmentation,\nDiversity-aware Queue, and Forgetting Factor of Queue. Our experimental results\nmanifest the new state of the arts on both few-shot generation and limited-data\ngeneration. On multiple datasets, FakeCLR acquires more than 15% FID\nimprovement compared to existing DE-GANs. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/iceli1007/FakeCLR.",

    "title": "Latent Partition Implicit with Surface Codes for 3D Representation",
    "abstract": "Deep implicit functions have shown remarkable shape modeling ability in\nvarious 3D computer vision tasks. One drawback is that it is hard for them to\nrepresent a 3D shape as multiple parts. Current solutions learn various\nprimitives and blend the primitives directly in the spatial space, which still\nstruggle to approximate the 3D shape accurately. To resolve this problem, we\nintroduce a novel implicit representation to represent a single 3D shape as a\nset of parts in the latent space, towards both highly accurate and plausibly\ninterpretable shape modeling. Our insight here is that both the part learning\nand the part blending can be conducted much easier in the latent space than in\nthe spatial space. We name our method Latent Partition Implicit (LPI), because\nof its ability of casting the global shape modeling into multiple local part\nmodeling, which partitions the global shape unity. LPI represents a shape as\nSigned Distance Functions (SDFs) using surface codes. Each surface code is a\nlatent code representing a part whose center is on the surface, which enables\nus to flexibly employ intrinsic attributes of shapes or additional surface\nproperties. Eventually, LPI can reconstruct both the shape and the parts on the\nshape, both of which are plausible meshes. LPI is a multi-level representation,\nwhich can partition a shape into different numbers of parts after training. LPI\ncan be learned without ground truth signed distances, point normals or any\nsupervision for part partition. LPI outperforms the latest methods under the\nwidely used benchmarks in terms of reconstruction accuracy and modeling\ninterpretability.

The computational and memory lightness of the system\nresults from the use of Exponential Moving Histograms. In our experimental\nstudy, we analyze the system's behavior with its parameters and, more\nimportantly, show examples where it detects problems that are not directly\nrelated to a single feature. This illustrates how FM eliminates the need to add\ncustom signals to detect specific types of problems and that monitoring the\navailable space of features is often enough.",

Many IRL algorithms require a known\ntransition model and sometimes even a known expert policy, or they at least\nrequire access to a generative model. However, these assumptions are too strong\nfor many real-world applications, where the environment can be accessed only\nthrough sequential interaction. We propose a novel IRL algorithm: Active\nexploration for Inverse Reinforcement Learning (AceIRL), which actively\nexplores an unknown environment and expert policy to quickly learn the expert's\nreward function and identify a good policy. AceIRL uses previous observations\nto construct confidence intervals that capture plausible reward functions and\nfind exploration policies that focus on the most informative regions of the\nenvironment. AceIRL is the first approach to active IRL with sample-complexity\nbounds that does not require a generative model of the environment. AceIRL\nmatches the sample complexity of active IRL with a generative model in the\nworst case. Additionally, we establish a problem-dependent bound that relates\nthe sample complexity of AceIRL to the suboptimality gap of a given IRL\nproblem.

(2021) challenges this view: defining interpolation as the state of\nbelonging to the convex hull of the training set, they show that the test set,\neither in input or neural space, cannot lie for the most part in this convex\nhull, due to the high dimensionality of the data, invoking the well known curse\nof dimensionality. Neural networks are then assumed to necessarily work in\nextrapolative mode. We here study the neural activities of the last hidden\nlayer of typical neural networks. Using an autoencoder to uncover the intrinsic\nspace underlying the neural activities, we show that this space is actually\nlow-dimensional, and that the better the model, the lower the dimensionality of\nthis intrinsic space. In this space, most samples of the test set actually lie\nin the convex hull of the training set: under the convex hull definition, the\nmodels thus happen to work in interpolation regime. Moreover, we show that\nbelonging to the convex hull does not seem to be the relevant criteria.\nDifferent measures of proximity to the training set are actually better related\nto performance accuracy. Thus, typical neural networks do seem to operate in\ninterpolation regime. Good generalization performances are linked to the\nability of a neural network to operate well in such a regime.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a practical method to enforce linear partial differential\nequation (PDE) constraints for functions defined by neural networks (NNs), up\nto a desired tolerance. By combining methods in differentiable physics and\napplications of the implicit function theorem to NN models, we develop a\ndifferentiable PDE-constrained NN layer. During training, our model learns a\nfamily of functions, each of which defines a mapping from PDE parameters to PDE\nsolutions. At inference time, the model finds an optimal linear combination of\nthe functions in the learned family by solving a PDE-constrained optimization\nproblem. Our method provides continuous solutions over the domain of interest\nthat exactly satisfy desired physical constraints. Our results show that\nincorporating hard constraints directly into the NN architecture achieves much\nlower test error, compared to training on an unconstrained objective.",

    "abstract": "Objects are usually associated with multiple attributes, and these attributes\noften exhibit high correlations. Modeling complex relationships between\nattributes poses a great challenge for multi-attribute learning. This paper\nproposes a simple yet generic framework named Label2Label to exploit the\ncomplex attribute correlations. Label2Label is the first attempt for\nmulti-attribute prediction from the perspective of language modeling.\nSpecifically, it treats each attribute label as a \"word\" describing the sample.\nAs each sample is annotated with multiple attribute labels, these \"words\" will\nnaturally form an unordered but meaningful \"sentence\", which depicts the\nsemantic information of the corresponding sample. Inspired by the remarkable\nsuccess of pre-training language models in NLP, Label2Label introduces an\nimage-conditioned masked language model, which randomly masks some of the\n\"word\" tokens from the label \"sentence\" and aims to recover them based on the\nmasked \"sentence\" and the context conveyed by image features. Our intuition is\nthat the instance-wise attribute relations are well grasped if the neural net\ncan infer the missing attributes based on the context and the remaining\nattribute hints. Label2Label is conceptually simple and empirically powerful.\nWithout incorporating task-specific prior knowledge and highly specialized\nnetwork designs, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on three\ndifferent multi-attribute learning tasks, compared to highly customized\ndomain-specific methods.

Traditionally, the difference between the\nhistogram and the underlying distribution (i.e., the approximation error) is\nmeasured using the $L_p$ norm, which sums the differences between the two\nfunctions over all items in the domain. Although useful in many applications,\nthe drawback of this error measure is that it treats approximation errors of\nall items in the same way, irrespective of whether the mass of an item is\nimportant for the downstream application that uses the approximation. As a\nresult, even relatively simple distributions cannot be approximated by succinct\nhistograms without incurring large error.\nIn this paper, we address this issue by adapting the definition of\napproximation so that only the errors of the items that belong to the support\nof the distribution are considered. Under this definition, we develop efficient\n1-pass and 2-pass streaming algorithms that compute near-optimal histograms in\nsub-linear space. We also present lower bounds on the space complexity of this\nproblem. Surprisingly, under this notion of error, there is an exponential gap\nin the space complexity of 1-pass and 2-pass streaming algorithms.

In contrast, some of the most popular and\ntraditional algorithms for RecSys solely focus on a given user-item-rating\nrelation without including side information. The goal of this case study is to\nprovide a performance comparison and assessment of RecSys and ML algorithms\nwhen side information is included. We chose the Movielens-100K data set since\nit is a standard for comparing RecSys algorithms. We compared six different\nfeature sets with varying quantities of features which were generated from the\nbaseline data and evaluated on a total of 19 RecSys algorithms, baseline ML\nalgorithms, Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) pipelines, and state-of-the-art\nRecSys algorithms that incorporate side information. The results show that\nadditional features benefit all algorithms we evaluated. However, the\ncorrelation between feature quantity and performance is not monotonous for\nAutoML and RecSys. In these categories, an analysis of feature importance\nrevealed that the quality of features matters more than quantity. Throughout\nour experiments, the average performance on the feature set with the lowest\nnumber of features is about 6% worse compared to that with the highest in terms\nof the Root Mean Squared Error. An interesting observation is that AutoML\noutperforms matrix factorization-based RecSys algorithms when additional\nfeatures are used. Almost all algorithms that can include side information have\nhigher performance when using the highest quantity of features. In the other\ncases, the performance difference is negligible (<1%).

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning remains one of the major directions of the\ncontemporary development of control engineering and machine learning. Nice\nintuition, flexible settings, ease of application are among the many perks of\nthis methodology. From the standpoint of machine learning, the main strength of\na reinforcement learning agent is its ability to ``capture\" (learn) the optimal\nbehavior in the given environment. Typically, the agent is built on neural\nnetworks and it is their approximation abilities that give rise to the above\nbelief. From the standpoint of control engineering, however, reinforcement\nlearning has serious deficiencies. The most significant one is the lack of\nstability guarantee of the agent-environment closed loop. A great deal of\nresearch was and is being made towards stabilizing reinforcement learning.\nSpeaking of stability, the celebrated Lyapunov theory is the de facto tool. It\nis thus no wonder that so many techniques of stabilizing reinforcement learning\nrely on the Lyapunov theory in one way or another. In control theory, there is\nan intricate connection between a stabilizing controller and a Lyapunov\nfunction. Employing such a pair seems thus quite attractive to design\nstabilizing reinforcement learning. However, computation of a Lyapunov function\nis generally a cumbersome process. In this note, we show how to construct a\nstabilizing reinforcement learning agent that does not employ such a function\nat all.

The grid operation becomes more arduous to avoid\nvoltage or thermal violations. While the Optimal Power Flow (OPF) algorithm is\nvastly discussed in the literature, little attention has been given to the\nrobustness of such centralised implementation, such as the provision of\nredundant control solutions during a communication failure. This paper aims to\nimplement a machine learning-based algorithm at each Intelligent Electronic\nDevice (IED) that mimics the centralised OPF used during communication failures\nusing IEC 61850 data models. Under normal circumstances, the IEDs communicate\nfor centralised OPF. In addition, the system is trained offline for all\noperational conditions and the individual look-up tables linking the actual\nvoltages to the DER setpoints are sent to the respective controllers. The\nregression models allow for the local reconstruction of the DER setpoints,\nemulating the overall OPF, in case of a communication failure. In addition to\nthe regression control, the paper also explains an offline learning approach\nfor periodic re-training of the regression models. The implementation is\nexperimentally verified using a Hardware-in-the-loop test setup. The tests\nshowed promising results compared to conventional control strategies during\ncommunication failures. When properly trained and coordinated, such an\nintuitive local control approach for each DER could be very beneficial for the\nbulk power system.

However, commonly used\nhand-crafted pooling approaches, e.g., max pooling and average pooling, may not\nwell preserve discriminative features. While many researchers have elaborately\ndesigned various pooling variants in spatial domain to handle these limitations\nwith much progress, the temporal aspect is rarely visited where directly\napplying hand-crafted methods or these specialized spatial variants may not be\noptimal. In this paper, we derive temporal lift pooling (TLP) from the Lifting\nScheme in signal processing to intelligently downsample features of different\ntemporal hierarchies. The Lifting Scheme factorizes input signals into various\nsub-bands with different frequency, which can be viewed as different temporal\nmovement patterns. Our TLP is a three-stage procedure, which performs signal\ndecomposition, component weighting and information fusion to generate a refined\ndownsized feature map. We select a typical temporal task with long sequences,\ni.e. continuous sign language recognition (CSLR), as our testbed to verify the\neffectiveness of TLP. Experiments on two large-scale datasets show TLP\noutperforms hand-crafted methods and specialized spatial variants by a large\nmargin (1.5%) with similar computational overhead. As a robust feature\nextractor, TLP exhibits great generalizability upon multiple backbones on\nvarious datasets and achieves new state-of-the-art results on two large-scale\nCSLR datasets.

Specifically, we first relax the\nrequirements of reasonable image-question pairs, which can be easily applied to\nany question types. Then, we design a knowledge distillation (KD) based answer\nassignment to generate pseudo answers for all composed image-question pairs,\nwhich are robust to both in-domain and out-of-distribution settings. Since\nKDDAug is a model-agnostic DA strategy, it can be seamlessly incorporated into\nany VQA architectures. Extensive ablation studies on multiple backbones and\nbenchmarks have demonstrated the effectiveness and generalization abilities of\nKDDAug.",

    "abstract": "Electron density irregularities present within the ionosphere induce\nsignificant fluctuations in global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals.\nFluctuations in signal power are referred to as amplitude scintillation and can\nbe monitored through the S4 index. Forecasting the severity of amplitude\nscintillation based on historical S4 index data is beneficial when real-time\ndata is unavailable. In this work, we study the possibility of using historical\ndata from a single GPS scintillation monitoring receiver to train a machine\nlearning (ML) model to forecast the severity of amplitude scintillation, either\nweak, moderate, or severe, with respect to temporal and spatial parameters. Six\ndifferent ML models were evaluated and the bagged trees model was the most\naccurate among them, achieving a forecasting accuracy of $81\\%$ using a\nbalanced dataset, and $97\\%$ using an imbalanced dataset.",

Simply restricting the\ncomputation to non-sensitive part of the data may leak sensitive data through\ninference based on data dependencies. While inference control from data\ndependencies during query processing has been studied in the literature,\nexisting solution either detect and deny queries causing leakage, or use a weak\nsecurity model that only protects against exact reconstruction of the sensitive\ndata.

We identify conditions under which full deniability can be\nachieved and develop an efficient algorithm that minimally hides non-sensitive\ncells during query processing to achieve full deniability.

In contrast to past work, we\nintegrate audio effects as differentiable operators in our framework, perform\nbackpropagation through audio effects, and optimize end-to-end using an\naudio-domain loss.

We survey a range of existing and new approaches for\ndifferentiable signal processing, showing how each can be integrated into our\nframework while discussing their trade-offs. We evaluate our approach on both\nspeech and music tasks, demonstrating that our approach generalizes both to\nunseen recordings and even to sample rates different than those seen during\ntraining.

    "abstract": "Quadruped robots are usually equipped with additional arms for manipulation,\nnegatively impacting price and weight. On the other hand, the requirements of\nlegged locomotion mean that the legs of such robots often possess the needed\ntorque and precision to perform manipulation. In this paper, we present a novel\ndesign for a small-scale quadruped robot equipped with two leg-mounted\nmanipulators inspired by crustacean chelipeds and knuckle-walker forelimbs. By\nmaking use of the actuators already present in the legs, we can achieve\nmanipulation using only 3 additional motors per limb. The design enables the\nuse of small and inexpensive actuators relative to the leg motors, further\nreducing cost and weight. The moment of inertia impact on the leg is small\nthanks to an integrated cable/pulley system. As we show in a suite of\ntele-operation experiments, the robot is capable of performing single- and\ndual-limb manipulation, as well as transitioning between manipulation modes.\nThe proposed design performs similarly to an additional arm while weighing and\ncosting 5 times less per manipulator and enabling the completion of tasks\nrequiring 2 manipulators.",

The present research applies both the larger (GPT-3) and smaller\n(GPT-2) language models to explore the complex strategies for the game of\nOthello (or Reverses). Given the game rules for rapid reversals of fortune, the\nlanguage model not only represents a candidate predictor of the next move based\non previous game moves but also avoids sparse rewards in gameplay. The language\nmodel automatically captures or emulates championship-level strategies. The\nfine-tuned GPT-2 model generates Othello games ranging from 13-71% completion,\nwhile the larger GPT-3 model reaches 41% of a complete game. Like previous work\nwith chess and Go, these language models offer a novel way to generate\nplausible game archives, particularly for comparing opening moves across a\nlarger sample than humanly possible to explore. A primary contribution of these\nmodels magnifies (by two-fold) the previous record for player archives (120,000\nhuman games over 45 years from 1977-2022), thus supplying the research\ncommunity with more diverse and original strategies for sampling with other\nreinforcement learning techniques.",

    "abstract": "Recent works have revealed an essential paradigm in designing loss functions\nthat differentiate individual losses vs. aggregate losses. The individual loss\nmeasures the quality of the model on a sample, while the aggregate loss\ncombines individual losses/scores over each training sample. Both have a common\nprocedure that aggregates a set of individual values to a single numerical\nvalue. The ranking order reflects the most fundamental relation among\nindividual values in designing losses. In addition, decomposability, in which a\nloss can be decomposed into an ensemble of individual terms, becomes a\nsignificant property of organizing losses/scores. This survey provides a\nsystematic and comprehensive review of rank-based decomposable losses in\nmachine learning. Specifically, we provide a new taxonomy of loss functions\nthat follows the perspectives of aggregate loss and individual loss. We\nidentify the aggregator to form such losses, which are examples of set\nfunctions. We organize the rank-based decomposable losses into eight\ncategories. Following these categories, we review the literature on rank-based\naggregate losses and rank-based individual losses. We describe general formulas\nfor these losses and connect them with existing research topics. We also\nsuggest future research directions spanning unexplored, remaining, and emerging\nissues in rank-based decomposable losses.",

In bilinear complexity, an\nalgorithm for evaluating a bilinear operator $\\beta : \\mathbb{U} \\times\n\\mathbb{V} \\to \\mathbb{W}$ is a decomposition $\\beta = \\varphi_1 \\otimes \\psi_1\n\\otimes w_1 + \\dots + \\varphi_r \\otimes \\psi_r \\otimes w_r $; the number of\nterms $r$ captures the speed of the algorithm; and its smallest possible value,\ni.e., the tensor rank of $\\beta$, quantifies the speed of a fastest algorithm.\nBilinear stability introduces norms to the mix: The growth factor of the\nalgorithm $\\lVert \\varphi_1 \\rVert_* \\lVert \\psi_1 \\rVert_* \\lVert w_1 \\rVert +\n\\dots + \\lVert \\varphi_r \\rVert_* \\lVert \\psi_r \\rVert_* \\lVert w_r \\rVert$\ncaptures the accuracy of the algorithm; and its smallest possible value, i.e.,\nthe tensor nuclear norm of $\\beta$, quantifies the accuracy of a stablest\nalgorithm. To substantiate this notion, we establish a bound for the forward\nerror in terms of the growth factor and present numerical evidence comparing\nvarious fast algorithms for matrix and complex multiplications, showing that\nlarger growth factors correlate with less accurate results. Compared to similar\nstudies of numerical stability, bilinear stability is more general, applying to\nany bilinear operators and not just matrix or complex multiplications; is more\nsimplistic, bounding forward error in terms of a single (growth) factor; and is\ntruly tensorial like bilinear complexity, invariant under any orthogonal change\nof coordinates.

    "abstract": "Relevance estimators are algorithms used by major social media platforms to\ndetermine what content is shown to users and its presentation order. These\nalgorithms aim to personalize the platforms' experience for users, increasing\nengagement and, therefore, platform revenue. However, at the large scale of\nmany social media platforms, many have concerns that the relevance estimation\nand personalization algorithms are opaque and can produce outcomes that are\nharmful to individuals or society. Legislations have been proposed in both the\nU.S. and the E.U. that mandate auditing of social media algorithms by external\nresearchers. But auditing at scale risks disclosure of users' private data and\nplatforms' proprietary algorithms, and thus far there has been no concrete\ntechnical proposal that can provide such auditing. Our goal is to propose a new\nmethod for platform-supported auditing that can meet the goals of the proposed\nlegislations. The first contribution of our work is to enumerate these\nchallenges and the limitations of existing auditing methods to implement these\npolicies at scale. Second, we suggest that limited, privileged access to\nrelevance estimators is the key to enabling generalizable platform-supported\nauditing of social media platforms by external researchers. Third, we show\nplatform-supported auditing need not risk user privacy nor disclosure of\nplatforms' business interests by proposing an auditing framework that protects\nagainst these risks. For a particular fairness metric, we show that ensuring\nprivacy imposes only a small constant factor increase (6.34x as an upper bound,\nand 4x for typical parameters) in the number of samples required for accurate\nauditing. Our technical contributions, combined with ongoing legal and policy\nefforts, can enable public oversight into how social media platforms affect\nindividuals and society by moving past the privacy-vs-transparency hurdle.",

    "abstract": "Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers have been successfully applied\nto solve many problems in formal verification such as bounded model checking\n(BMC) for many classes of systems from integrated circuits to cyber-physical\nsystems. Typically, BMC is performed by checking satisfiability of a possibly\nlong, but quantifier-free formula. However, BMC problems can naturally be\nencoded as quantified formulas over the number of BMC steps. In this approach,\nwe then use decision procedures supporting quantifiers to check satisfiability\nof these quantified formulas. This approach has previously been applied to\nperform BMC using a Quantified Boolean Formula (QBF) encoding for purely\ndiscrete systems, and then discharges the QBF checks using QBF solvers. In this\npaper, we present a new quantified encoding of BMC for rectangular hybrid\nautomata (RHA), which requires using more general logics due to the real\n(dense) time and real-valued state variables modeling continuous states. We\nhave implemented a preliminary experimental prototype of the method using the\nHyST model transformation tool to generate the quantified BMC (QBMC) queries\nfor the Z3 SMT solver. We describe experimental results on several timed and\nhybrid automata benchmarks, such as the Fischer and Lynch-Shavit mutual\nexclusion algorithms. We compare our approach to quantifier-free BMC\napproaches, such as those in the dReach tool that uses the dReal SMT solver,\nand the HyComp tool built on top of nuXmv that uses the MathSAT SMT solver.\nBased on our promising experimental results, QBMC may in the future be an\neffective and scalable analysis approach for RHA and other classes of hybrid\nautomata as further improvements are made in quantifier handling in SMT solvers\nsuch as Z3.",

Based\non this representation, we present a dynamic SLAM, dubbed DeFlowSLAM, that\nexploits both static and dynamic pixels in the images to solve the camera\nposes, rather than simply using static background pixels as other dynamic SLAM\nsystems do. We propose a dynamic update module to train our DeFlowSLAM in a\nself-supervised manner, where a dense bundle adjustment layer takes in\nestimated static flow fields and the weights controlled by the dynamic mask and\noutputs the residual of the optimized static flow fields, camera poses, and\ninverse depths. The static and dynamic flow fields are estimated by warping the\ncurrent image to the neighboring images, and the optical flow can be obtained\nby summing the two fields. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeFlowSLAM\ngeneralizes well to both static and dynamic scenes as it exhibits comparable\nperformance to the state-of-the-art DROID-SLAM in static and less dynamic\nscenes while significantly outperforming DROID-SLAM in highly dynamic\nenvironments.

While there are some accounts of how these resources modulate\nstatistical capacity, far less is known about their effect on the computational\nproblem of model training. This work conducts such an exploration through the\nlens of learning $k$-sparse parities of $n$ bits, a canonical family of\nproblems which pose theoretical computational barriers. In this setting, we\nfind that neural networks exhibit surprising phase transitions when scaling up\ndataset size and running time. In particular, we demonstrate empirically that\nwith standard training, a variety of architectures learn sparse parities with\n$n^{O(k)}$ examples, with loss (and error) curves abruptly dropping after\n$n^{O(k)}$ iterations. These positive results nearly match known SQ lower\nbounds, even without an explicit sparsity-promoting prior. We elucidate the\nmechanisms of these phenomena with a theoretical analysis: we find that the\nphase transition in performance is not due to SGD \"stumbling in the dark\" until\nit finds the hidden set of features (a natural algorithm which also runs in\n$n^{O(k)}$ time); instead, we show that SGD gradually amplifies a Fourier gap\nin the population gradient.",

    "abstract": "Transferable adversarial attacks optimize adversaries from a pretrained\nsurrogate model and known label space to fool the unknown black-box models.\nTherefore, these attacks are restricted by the availability of an effective\nsurrogate model. In this work, we relax this assumption and propose Adversarial\nPixel Restoration as a self-supervised alternative to train an effective\nsurrogate model from scratch under the condition of no labels and few data\nsamples. Our training approach is based on a min-max objective which reduces\noverfitting via an adversarial objective and thus optimizes for a more\ngeneralizable surrogate model. Our proposed attack is complimentary to our\nadversarial pixel restoration and is independent of any task specific objective\nas it can be launched in a self-supervised manner. We successfully demonstrate\nthe adversarial transferability of our approach to Vision Transformers as well\nas Convolutional Neural Networks for the tasks of classification, object\ndetection, and video segmentation.

    "title": "Channel Estimation via Gradient Pursuit for MmWave Massive MIMO Systems  with One-Bit ADCs",
    "abstract": "In millimeter wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)\nsystems, one-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are employed to reduce the\nimpractically high power consumption, which is incurred by the wide bandwidth\nand large arrays. In practice, the mmWave band consists of a small number of\npaths, thereby rendering sparse virtual channels. Then, the resulting maximum a\nposteriori (MAP) channel estimation problem is a sparsity-constrained\noptimization problem, which is NP-hard to solve. In this paper, iterative\napproximate MAP channel estimators for mmWave massive MIMO systems with one-bit\nADCs are proposed, which are based on the gradient support pursuit (GraSP) and\ngradient hard thresholding pursuit (GraHTP) algorithms. The GraSP and GraHTP\nalgorithms iteratively pursue the gradient of the objective function to\napproximately optimize convex objective functions with sparsity constraints,\nwhich are the generalizations of the compressive sampling matching pursuit\n(CoSaMP) and hard thresholding pursuit (HTP) algorithms, respectively, in\ncompressive sensing (CS). However, the performance of the GraSP and GraHTP\nalgorithms is not guaranteed when the objective function is ill-conditioned,\nwhich may be incurred by the highly coherent sensing matrix. In this paper, the\nband maximum selecting (BMS) hard thresholding technique is proposed to modify\nthe GraSP and GraHTP algorithms, namely the BMSGraSP and BMSGraHTP algorithms,\nrespectively. The BMSGraSP and BMSGraHTP algorithms pursue the gradient of the\nobjective function based on the band maximum criterion instead of the naive\nhard thresholding. In addition, a fast Fourier transform-based (FFT-based) fast\nimplementation is developed to reduce the complexity. The BMSGraSP and\nBMSGraHTP algorithms are shown to be both accurate and efficient, whose\nperformance is verified through extensive simulations.",

    "abstract": "In many practical scenarios, a flying insect must search for the source of an\nemitted cue which is advected by the atmospheric wind. On the macroscopic\nscales of interest, turbulence tends to mix the cue into patches of relatively\nhigh concentration over a background of very low concentration, so that the\ninsect will only detect the cue intermittently and cannot rely on chemotactic\nstrategies which simply climb the concentration gradient. In this work, we cast\nthis search problem in the language of a partially observable Markov decision\nprocess (POMDP) and use the Perseus algorithm to compute strategies that are\nnear-optimal with respect to the arrival time. We test the computed strategies\non a large two-dimensional grid, present the resulting trajectories and arrival\ntime statistics, and compare these to the corresponding results for several\nheuristic strategies, including (space-aware) infotaxis, Thompson sampling, and\nQMDP. We find that the near-optimal policy found by our implementation of\nPerseus outperforms all heuristics we test by several measures. We use the\nnear-optimal policy to study how the search difficulty depends on the starting\nlocation. We discuss additionally the choice of initial belief and the\nrobustness of the policies to changes in the environment. Finally, we present a\ndetailed and pedagogical discussion about the implementation of the Perseus\nalgorithm, including the benefits -- and pitfalls -- of employing a reward\nshaping function.",

In this work, we introduce a\ngeneralization of this theory which applies to any ground-truth graph and\nspecifies qualitatively how disentangled the learned representation is expected\nto be, via a new equivalence relation over models we call consistency. This\nequivalence captures which factors are expected to remain entangled and which\nare not based on the specific form of the ground-truth graph. We call this\nweaker form of identifiability partial disentanglement. The graphical criterion\nthat allows complete disentanglement, proposed in an earlier work, can be\nderived as a special case of our theory.

    "abstract": "Over the last few years, research in automatic sleep scoring has mainly\nfocused on developing increasingly complex deep learning architectures.\nHowever, recently these approaches achieved only marginal improvements, often\nat the expense of requiring more data and more expensive training procedures.\nDespite all these efforts and their satisfactory performance, automatic sleep\nstaging solutions are not widely adopted in a clinical context yet. We argue\nthat most deep learning solutions for sleep scoring are limited in their\nreal-world applicability as they are hard to train, deploy, and reproduce.\nMoreover, these solutions lack interpretability and transparency, which are\noften key to increase adoption rates. In this work, we revisit the problem of\nsleep stage classification using classical machine learning. Results show that\nstate-of-the-art performance can be achieved with a conventional machine\nlearning pipeline consisting of preprocessing, feature extraction, and a simple\nmachine learning model. In particular, we analyze the performance of a linear\nmodel and a non-linear (gradient boosting) model. Our approach surpasses\nstate-of-the-art (that uses the same data) on two public datasets: Sleep-EDF\nSC-20 (MF1 0.810) and Sleep-EDF ST (MF1 0.795), while achieving competitive\nresults on Sleep-EDF SC-78 (MF1 0.775) and MASS SS3 (MF1 0.817). We show that,\nfor the sleep stage scoring task, the expressiveness of an engineered feature\nvector is on par with the internally learned representations of deep learning\nmodels. This observation opens the door to clinical adoption, as a\nrepresentative feature vector allows to leverage both the interpretability and\nsuccessful track record of traditional machine learning models.",

Finite-section approximations of the lifted\nsystem has been widely used to study dynamical and control properties of the\noriginal nonlinear system. In this context, some of the outstanding problems\nare to determine under what conditions, as the finite-section order (i.e.,\ntruncation length) increases, the trajectory of the resulting approximate\nlinear system from the finite-section scheme converges to that of the original\nnonlinear system and whether the time interval over which the convergence\nhappens can be quantified explicitly. In this paper, we provide explicit error\nbounds for the finite-section approximation and prove that the convergence is\nindeed exponential with respect to the finite-section order. For a class of\nnonlinear systems, it is shown that one can achieve exponential convergence\nover the entire time horizon up to infinity.

Lung cancer generally first appears as lesions developing within the\nbronchial epithelium of the airway walls. Bronchoscopy is the procedure of\nchoice for effective noninvasive bronchial lesion detection. In particular,\nautofluorescence bronchoscopy (AFB) discriminates the autofluorescence\nproperties of normal and diseased tissue, whereby lesions appear reddish brown\nin AFB video frames, while normal tissue appears green. Because recent studies\nshow AFB's ability for high lesion sensitivity, it has become a potentially\npivotal method during the standard bronchoscopic airway exam for early-stage\nlung cancer detection. Unfortunately, manual inspection of AFB video is\nextremely tedious and error-prone, while limited effort has been expended\ntoward potentially more robust automatic AFB lesion detection and segmentation.\nWe propose a real-time deep learning architecture ESFPNet for robust detection\nand segmentation of bronchial lesions from an AFB video stream.

The main challenge in\nportfolio construction with illiquid asset classes is that we do not have\ndirect control over our positions, as we do in liquid asset classes. Instead we\ncan only make commitments; the position builds up over time as capital calls\ncome in, and reduces over time as distributions occur, neither of which the\ninvestor has direct control over. The effect on positions of our commitments is\nsubject to a delay, typically of a few years, and is also unknown or\nstochastic. A further challenge is the requirement that we can meet the capital\ncalls, with very high probability, with our liquid assets.\nWe formulate the illiquid dynamics as a random linear system, and propose a\nconvex optimization based model predictive control (MPC) policy for allocating\nliquid assets and making new illiquid commitments in each period. Despite the\nchallenges of time delay and uncertainty, we show that this policy attains\nperformance surprisingly close to a fictional setting where we pretend the\nilliquid asset classes are completely liquid, and we can arbitrarily and\nimmediately adjust our positions.

Skilled players can be\ndistinguished from the others based on their gaming behaviour. Differences\nappear from the very first moves of the game, with experts tending to\nspecialize and repeat the same openings while beginners explore and diversify\nmore. However, experts experience a broader response repertoire, and display a\ndeeper understanding of different variations within the same line. Over time,\nthe opening diversity of a player tends to decrease, hinting at the development\nof individual playing styles. Nevertheless, we find that players are often not\nable to recognize their most successful openings. Overall, our work contributes\nto quantifying human performance in competitive settings, providing a first\nlarge-scale quantitative analysis of individual careers in chess, helping\nunveil the determinants separating elite from beginner performance.",

    "abstract": "We present an approach to reduce the performance disparity between geographic\nregions without degrading performance on the overall user population for ASR. A\npopular approach is to fine-tune the model with data from regions where the ASR\nmodel has a higher word error rate (WER). However, when the ASR model is\nadapted to get better performance on these high-WER regions, its parameters\nwander from the previous optimal values, which can lead to worse performance in\nother regions. In our proposed method, we utilize the elastic weight\nconsolidation (EWC) regularization loss to identify directions in parameters\nspace along which the ASR weights can vary to improve for high-error regions,\nwhile still maintaining performance on the speaker population overall. Our\nresults demonstrate that EWC can reduce the word error rate (WER) in the region\nwith highest WER by 3.2% relative while reducing the overall WER by 1.3%\nrelative. We also evaluate the role of language and acoustic models in ASR\nfairness and propose a clustering algorithm to identify WER disparities based\non geographic region.",

    "abstract": "It is feasible to recognize the presence and seriousness of eye disease by\ninvestigating the progressions in retinal biological structure. Fundus\nexamination is a diagnostic procedure to examine the biological structure and\nanomaly of the eye. Ophthalmic diseases like glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy,\nand cataract are the main reason for visual impairment around the world. Ocular\nDisease Intelligent Recognition (ODIR-5K) is a benchmark structured fundus\nimage dataset utilized by researchers for multi-label multi-disease\nclassification of fundus images. This work presents a discriminative kernel\nconvolution network (DKCNet), which explores discriminative region-wise\nfeatures without adding extra computational cost. DKCNet is composed of an\nattention block followed by a squeeze and excitation (SE) block. The attention\nblock takes features from the backbone network and generates discriminative\nfeature attention maps. The SE block takes the discriminative feature maps and\nimproves channel interdependencies. Better performance of DKCNet is observed\nwith InceptionResnet backbone network for multi-label classification of ODIR-5K\nfundus images with 96.08 AUC, 94.28 F1-score and 0.81 kappa score. The proposed\nmethod splits the common target label for an eye pair based on the diagnostic\nkeyword. Based on these labels oversampling and undersampling is done to\nresolve class imbalance. To check the biasness of proposed model towards\ntraining data, the model trained on ODIR dataset is tested on three publicly\navailable benchmark datasets.

    "abstract": "Video frame interpolation (VFI) serves as a useful tool for many video\nprocessing applications. Recently, it has also been applied in the video\ncompression domain for enhancing both conventional video codecs and\nlearning-based compression architectures. While there has been an increased\nfocus on the development of enhanced frame interpolation algorithms in recent\nyears, the perceptual quality assessment of interpolated content remains an\nopen field of research. In this paper, we present a bespoke full reference\nvideo quality metric for VFI, FloLPIPS, that builds on the popular perceptual\nimage quality metric, LPIPS, which captures the perceptual degradation in\nextracted image feature space. In order to enhance the performance of LPIPS for\nevaluating interpolated content, we re-designed its spatial feature aggregation\nstep by using the temporal distortion (through comparing optical flows) to\nweight the feature difference maps. Evaluated on the BVI-VFI database, which\ncontains 180 test sequences with various frame interpolation artefacts,\nFloLPIPS shows superior correlation performance (with statistical significance)\nwith subjective ground truth over 12 popular quality assessors. To facilitate\nfurther research in VFI quality assessment, our code is publicly available at\nhttps://danielism97.github.io/FloLPIPS.",

    "abstract": "Recently, speech enhancement technologies that are based on deep learning\nhave received considerable research attention. If the spatial information in\nmicrophone signals is exploited, microphone arrays can be advantageous under\nsome adverse acoustic conditions compared with single-microphone systems.\nHowever, multichannel speech enhancement is often performed in the short-time\nFourier transform (STFT) domain, which renders the enhancement approach\ncomputationally expensive. To remedy this problem, we propose a novel\nequivalent rectangular bandwidth (ERB)-scaled spatial coherence feature that is\ndependent on the target speaker activity between two ERB bands. Experiments\nconducted using a four-microphone array in a reverberant environment, which\ninvolved speech interference, demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed system.\nThis study also demonstrated that a network that was trained with the\nERB-scaled spatial feature was robust against variations in the geometry and\nnumber of the microphones in the array.",

    "abstract": "Combinatorial optimization problems can be solved by heuristic algorithms\nsuch as simulated annealing (SA) which aims to find the global minima solution\nwithin a large search space through thermal fluctuations. The algorithm\ngenerates new solutions through Markov-chain Monte Carlo techniques. The latter\ncan result in severe limitations, such as slow convergence and a tendency to\nstay within the same local search space at small temperatures. To overcome\nthese shortcomings, we use the variational classical annealing (VCA) framework\nthat combines autoregressive recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with traditional\nannealing to sample solutions independent of each other. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate the potential of using VCA as an approach to solving real-world\noptimization problems. We explore VCA's performance in comparison with SA at\nsolving three popular optimization problems: the maximum cut problem (Max-Cut),\nthe nurse scheduling problem (NSP), and the traveling salesman problem (TSP).\nFor all three problems, we find that VCA outperforms SA on average in the\nasymptotic limit. Interestingly, we reach large system sizes up to $256$ cities\nfor the TSP. We conclude that in the best-case scenario, VCA can serve as a\ngreat alternative when SA fails to find the optimal solution.",

A pervasive approach for\nsynthesizing target images involves one-shot mapping through generative\nadversarial networks (GAN).

Here,\nwe propose a novel method based on adversarial diffusion modeling, SynDiff, for\nimproved reliability in medical image synthesis. To capture a direct correlate\nof the image distribution, SynDiff leverages a conditional diffusion process to\nprogressively map noise and source images onto the target image. For fast and\naccurate image sampling during inference, large diffusion steps are coupled\nwith adversarial projections in the reverse diffusion direction. To enable\ntraining on unpaired datasets, a cycle-consistent architecture is devised with\ntwo coupled diffusion processes to synthesize the target given source and the\nsource given target. Extensive assessments are reported on the utility of\nSynDiff against competing GAN and diffusion models in multi-contrast MRI and\nMRI-CT translation. Our demonstrations indicate that SynDiff offers superior\nperformance against competing baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively.",

    "abstract": "Over the years, population-level tobacco control policies have considerably\nreduced smoking prevalence worldwide. However, the rate of decline of smoking\nprevalence is slowing down. Therefore, there is a need for models that capture\nthe full complexity of the smoking epidemic. These models can then be used as\ntest-beds to develop new policies to limit the spread of smoking. Current\nmodels of smoking dynamics mainly use ordinary differential equation (ODE)\nmodels, where studying the effect of an individual's contact network is\nchallenging. They also do not consider all the interactions between individuals\nthat can lead to changes in smoking behaviour, implying that they do not\nconsider valuable information on the spread of smoking behaviour.\nIn this context, we develop an agent-based model (ABM), calibrate and then\nvalidate it on historical trends observed in the US and UK. Our ABM considers\nspontaneous terms, interactions between agents, and the agent's contact\nnetwork. To explore the effect of the underlying network on smoking dynamics,\nwe test the ABM on six different networks, both synthetic and real-world. In\naddition, we also compare the ABM with an ODE model. Our results suggest that\nthe dynamics from the ODE model are similar to the ABM only when the network\nstructure is fully connected (FC). The FC network performs poorly in\nreplicating the empirical trends in the data, while the real-world network best\nreplicates it amongst the six networks. Further, when information on the\nreal-world network is unavailable, our ABM on Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi\nbenchmark networks (or networks with a similar average degree as the real-world\nnetwork) can be used to model smoking behaviour. These results suggest that\nnetworks are essential for modelling smoking behaviour and that our ABM can be\nused to develop network-based intervention strategies and policies for tobacco\ncontrol.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we present formulations for regularized Kullback-Leibler and\nR\\'enyi divergences via the Alpha Log-Determinant (Log-Det) divergences between\npositive Hilbert-Schmidt operators on Hilbert spaces in two different settings,\nnamely (i) covariance operators and Gaussian measures defined on reproducing\nkernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS); and (ii) Gaussian processes with squared\nintegrable sample paths. For characteristic kernels, the first setting leads to\ndivergences between arbitrary Borel probability measures on a complete,\nseparable metric space. We show that the Alpha Log-Det divergences are\ncontinuous in the Hilbert-Schmidt norm, which enables us to apply laws of large\nnumbers for Hilbert space-valued random variables. As a consequence of this, we\nshow that, in both settings, the infinite-dimensional divergences can be\nconsistently and efficiently estimated from their finite-dimensional versions,\nusing finite-dimensional Gram matrices/Gaussian measures and finite sample\ndata, with {\\it dimension-independent} sample complexities in all cases. RKHS\nmethodology plays a central role in the theoretical analysis in both settings.\nThe mathematical formulation is illustrated by numerical experiments.",

    "title": "Multi-head Cascaded Swin Transformers with Attention to k-space Sampling  Pattern for Accelerated MRI Reconstruction",
    "abstract": "Global correlations are widely seen in human anatomical structures due to\nsimilarity across tissues and bones. These correlations are reflected in\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans as a result of close-range proton\ndensity and T1/T2 parameter. Furthermore, to achieve accelerated MRI, k-space\ndata are undersampled which causes global aliasing artifacts. Convolutional\nneural network (CNN) models are widely utilized for accelerated MRI\nreconstruction, but those models are limited in capturing global correlations\ndue to the intrinsic locality of the convolution operation. The\nself-attention-based transformer models are capable of capturing global\ncorrelations among image features, however, the current contributions of\ntransformer models for MRI reconstruction are minute. The existing\ncontributions mostly provide CNN-transformer hybrid solutions and rarely\nleverage the physics of MRI. In this paper, we propose a physics-based\nstand-alone (convolution free) transformer model titled, the Multi-head\nCascaded Swin Transformers (McSTRA) for accelerated MRI reconstruction. McSTRA\ncombines several interconnected MRI physics-related concepts with the\ntransformer networks: it exploits global MR features via the shifted window\nself-attention mechanism; it extracts MR features belonging to different\nspectral components separately using a multi-head setup; it iterates between\nintermediate de-aliasing and k-space correction via a cascaded network with\ndata consistency in k-space and intermediate loss computations; furthermore, we\npropose a novel positional embedding generation mechanism to guide\nself-attention utilizing the point spread function corresponding to the\nundersampling mask. Our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MRI\nreconstruction methods both visually and quantitatively while depicting\nimproved resolution and removal of aliasing artifacts.",

    "abstract": "Introduction Automated segmentation of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs)\nis an essential step in neuroimaging analysis of Magnetic Resonance Imaging\n(MRI). Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR-weighted) is an MRI contrast\nthat is particularly useful to visualize and quantify WMHs, a hallmark of\ncerebral small vessel disease and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Clinical MRI\nprotocols migrate to a three-dimensional (3D) FLAIR-weighted acquisition to\nenable high spatial resolution in all three voxel dimensions. The current study\ndetails the deployment of deep learning tools to enable automated WMH\nsegmentation and characterization from 3D FLAIR-weighted images acquired as\npart of a national AD imaging initiative.\nMaterials and methods Among 642 participants (283 male, mean age: (65.18 +/-\n9.33) years) from the DDI study, two in-house networks were trained and\nvalidated across five national collection sites. Three models were tested on a\nheld-out subset of the internal data from the 642 participants and an external\ndataset with 29 cases from an international collaborator. These test sets were\nevaluated independently. Five established WMH performance metrics were used for\ncomparison against ground truth human-in-the-loop segmentation.\nResults Of the three networks tested, the 3D nnU-Net had the best performance\nwith an average dice similarity coefficient score of 0.78 +/- 0.10, performing\nbetter than both the in-house developed 2.5D model and the SOTA Deep Bayesian\nnetwork.\nConclusion With the increasing use of 3D FLAIR-weighted images in MRI\nprotocols, our results suggest that WMH segmentation models can be trained on\n3D data and yield WMH segmentation performance that is comparable to or better\nthan state-of-the-art without the need for including T1-weighted image series.",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel deep neural network (DNN) architecture for compressing an\nimage when a correlated image is available as side information only at the\ndecoder side, a special case of the well-known and heavily studied distributed\nsource coding (DSC) problem. In particular, we consider a pair of stereo\nimages, which have overlapping fields of view, captured by a synchronized and\ncalibrated pair of cameras; and therefore, are highly correlated. We assume\nthat one image of the pair is to be compressed and transmitted, while the other\nimage is available only at the decoder. In the proposed architecture, the\nencoder maps the input image to a latent space using a DNN, quantizes the\nlatent representation, and compresses it losslessly using entropy coding. The\nproposed decoder extracts useful information common between the images solely\nfrom the available side information, as well as a latent representation of the\nside information. Then, the latent representations of the two images, one\nreceived from the encoder, the other extracted locally, along with the locally\ngenerated common information, are fed to the respective decoders of the two\nimages. We employ a cross-attention module (CAM) to align the feature maps\nobtained in the intermediate layers of the respective decoders of the two\nimages, thus allowing better utilization of the side information. We train and\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on various realistic\nsetups, such as KITTI and Cityscape datasets of stereo image pairs. Our results\nshow that the proposed architecture is capable of exploiting the decoder-only\nside information in a more efficient manner as it outperforms previous works.\nWe also show that the proposed method is able to provide significant gains even\nin the case of uncalibrated and unsynchronized camera array use cases.",

In this paper, we provide an experimental study on ridge regression,\nto compare the pGMM kernel regression with the ordinary ridge linear regression\nas well as the RBF kernel ridge regression. Perhaps surprisingly, even without\na tuning parameter (i.e., $p=1$ for the power parameter of the pGMM kernel),\nthe pGMM kernel already performs well. Furthermore, by tuning the parameter\n$p$, this (deceptively simple) pGMM kernel even performs quite comparably to\nboosted trees.\nBoosting and boosted trees are very popular in machine learning practice. For\nregression tasks, typically, practitioners use $L_2$ boost, i.e., for\nminimizing the $L_2$ loss. Sometimes for the purpose of robustness, the $L_1$\nboost might be a choice. In this study, we implement $L_p$ boost for $p\\geq 1$\nand include it in the package of ``Fast ABC-Boost''. Perhaps also surprisingly,\nthe best performance (in terms of $L_2$ regression loss) is often attained at\n$p>2$, in some cases at $p\\gg 2$.

Therefore, $G$-dual\nteleparallel pairs provide a generalization of the notion of Statistical\nManifolds usually employed in Information Geometry, and we present explicit\nexamples of $G$-dual teleparallel pairs arising both in the context of both\nClassical and Quantum Information Geometry.",

    "title": "Development of Massively Parallel Near Peak Performance Solvers for  Three-Dimensional Geodynamic Modelling",
    "abstract": "We address in this thesis the current need to design new parallel algorithms\nand tools that ease the development of geodynamic modelling applications that\nare suited for today's and tomorrow's hardware. We present (1) the MATLAB HPC\ncompiler HPC.m, which greatly simplifies the building of parallel high\nperformance applications and (2) parallel algorithms for the 3D simulation of\nstrongly nonlinear processes as mechanical and reactive porosity waves. To\nsimulate mechanical porosity waves we employ a massively parallel algorithm\nthat permits to resolve the deformation of fluid-filled viscoelastic porous\nmedia in 3D. The utilized mathematical model is based on Biot's poroelastic\ntheory, extended to account for viscous deformation and plastic yielding. The\nmodelling results exhibit the impact of decompaction weakening on the formation\nof three-dimensional solitary-wave-like moving porosity channels. To simulate\nreactive porosity waves we use a solver for 3D deformation of fluid-filled\nreactive viscous porous media. The Damk\\\"ohler number (Da) of the simulations\nis varied in order to estimate the respective roles of viscous deformation (low\nDa) and reaction (high Da) on wave propagation. 3D waves are found to propagate\nindependently of their source at constant speed by going through each other for\nall the investigated Da. Soliton-like wave propagation as a result of\nmetamorphic reaction provides an efficient mechanism for fluid flow in the\nEarth's crust. We illustrate the great performance and versatility of HPC.m by\ndeploying it to generate solvers for a variety of physics across multiple Earth\nScience disciplines. All solvers run close to hardware's peak performance and\nwere shown to scale linearly on a institute cluster with 80 GPUs. Moreover, our\nnonlinear poroviscoelastic two-phase flow solver scales close to ideally on Piz\nDaint's 5000 GPUs at the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre.",

    "title": "Integrated Sensing and Communications with Joint Beam Squint and Beam  Split for Massive MIMO",
    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) has attracted tremendous\nattention for the future 6G wireless communication systems. To improve the\ntransmission rates and sensing accuracy, massive multi-input multi-output\n(MIMO) technique is leveraged with large transmission bandwidth. However, the\ngrowing size of transmission bandwidth and antenna array results in the beam\nsquint effect, which hampers sensing and communications. Moreover, the time\noverhead of the traditional sensing algorithm is prohibitive for practical\nsystems. In this paper, instead of alleviating the wideband beam squint effect,\nwe take advantage of joint beam squint and beam split effect and propose a\nnovel user directions sensing method integrated with massive MIMO orthogonal\nfrequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Specifically, with the beam\nsquint effect, the BS utilizes the true-time-delay (TTD) lines to make the\nbeams of different OFDM subcarriers steer towards different directions\nsimultaneously. The users feedback the subcarrier frequency with the maximum\narray gain to the BS. Then, the BS calculates the direction based on the\nfeedback subcarrier frequency. Futhermore, the beam split effect introduced by\nenlarging the inter-antenna spacing is exploited to expand the sensing range.\nThe proposed sensing method operates over frequency-domain, and the intended\nsensing range is covered by all the subcarriers simultaneously, which reduces\nthe time overhead significantly. Simulation results have demonstrated the\neffectiveness as well as the superior performance of the proposed ISAC scheme.",

    "title": "Package for Fast ABC-Boost",
    "abstract": "This report presents the open-source package which implements the series of\nour boosting works in the past years. In particular, the package includes\nmainly three lines of techniques, among which the following two are already the\nstandard implementations in popular boosted tree platforms:\n(i) The histogram-based (feature-binning) approach makes the tree\nimplementation convenient and efficient. In Li et al (2007), a simple\nfixed-length adaptive binning algorithm was developed. In this report, we\ndemonstrate that such a simple algorithm is still surprisingly effective\ncompared to more sophisticated variants in popular tree platforms.\n(ii) The explicit gain formula in Li (20010) for tree splitting based on\nsecond-order derivatives of the loss function typically improves, often\nconsiderably, over the first-order methods. Although the gain formula in Li\n(2010) was derived for logistic regression loss, it is a generic formula for\nloss functions with second-derivatives. For example, the open-source package\nalso includes $L_p$ regression for $p\\geq 1$.\nThe main contribution of this package is the ABC-Boost (adaptive base class\nboosting) for multi-class classification. The initial work in Li (2008) derived\na new set of derivatives of the classical multi-class logistic regression by\nspecifying a \"base class\". The accuracy can be substantially improved if the\nbase class is chosen properly. The major technical challenge is to design a\nsearch strategy to select the base class. The prior published works implemented\nan exhaustive search procedure to find the base class which is computationally\ntoo expensive. Recently, a new report (Li and Zhao, 20022) presents a unified\nframework of \"Fast ABC-Boost\" which allows users to efficiently choose the\nproper search space for the base class.\nThe package provides interfaces for linux, windows, mac, matlab, R, python.",

In particular, we\nobtain universal continuity bound for the von Neumann entropy under energy-type\nconstraint which in the case of one-mode quantum oscillator is close to the\nspecialized optimal continuity bound presented recently by Becker, Datta and\nJabbour.\nIt is essential that the proposed method applied to nonnegative functions\ngives one-side continuity bounds for quasi-classical states with rank/energy\nconstraint imposed only on one state.",

    "title": "Quantum tomography using state-preparation unitaries",
    "abstract": "We describe algorithms to obtain an approximate classical description of a\n$d$-dimensional quantum state when given access to a unitary (and its inverse)\nthat prepares it. For pure states we characterize the query complexity for\n$\\ell_q$-norm error up to logarithmic factors. As a special case, we show that\nit takes $\\widetilde{\\Theta}(d/\\varepsilon)$ applications of the unitaries to\nobtain an $\\varepsilon$-$\\ell_2$-approximation of the state. For mixed states\nwe consider a similar model, where the unitary prepares a purification of the\nstate. In this model we give an efficient algorithm for obtaining Schatten\n$q$-norm estimates of a rank-$r$ mixed state, giving query upper bounds that\nare close to optimal. In particular, we show that a trace-norm ($q=1$) estimate\ncan be obtained with $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(dr/\\varepsilon)$ queries. This\nimproves (assuming our stronger input model) the $\\varepsilon$-dependence over\nthe algorithm of Haah et al.\\ (2017) that uses a joint measurement on\n$\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(dr/\\varepsilon^2)$ copies of the state. To our\nknowledge, the most sample-efficient results for pure-state tomography come\nfrom setting the rank to $1$ in generic mixed-state tomography algorithms,\nwhich can be computationally demanding. We describe sample-optimal algorithms\nfor pure states that are easy and fast to implement. Along the way we show that\nan $\\ell_\\infty$-norm estimate of a normalized vector induces a (slightly\nworse) $\\ell_q$-norm estimate for that vector, without losing a\ndimension-dependent factor in the precision. We also develop an unbiased and\nsymmetric version of phase estimation, where the probability distribution of\nthe estimate is centered around the true value. Finally, we give an efficient\nmethod for estimating multiple expectation values, improving over the recent\nresult by Huggins et al.\\ (2021) when the measurement operators do not fully\noverlap.",
