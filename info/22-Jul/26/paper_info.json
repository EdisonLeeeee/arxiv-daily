    "title": "Rich Feature Distillation with Feature Affinity Module for Efficient  Image Dehazing",
    "abstract": "Single-image haze removal is a long-standing hurdle for computer vision\napplications. Several works have been focused on transferring advances from\nimage classification, detection, and segmentation to the niche of image\ndehazing, primarily focusing on contrastive learning and knowledge\ndistillation. However, these approaches prove computationally expensive,\nraising concern regarding their applicability to on-the-edge use-cases. This\nwork introduces a simple, lightweight, and efficient framework for single-image\nhaze removal, exploiting rich \"dark-knowledge\" information from a lightweight\npre-trained super-resolution model via the notion of heterogeneous knowledge\ndistillation. We designed a feature affinity module to maximize the flow of\nrich feature semantics from the super-resolution teacher to the student\ndehazing network. In order to evaluate the efficacy of our proposed framework,\nits performance as a plug-and-play setup to a baseline model is examined. Our\nexperiments are carried out on the RESIDE-Standard dataset to demonstrate the\nrobustness of our framework to the synthetic and real-world domains. The\nextensive qualitative and quantitative results provided establish the\neffectiveness of the framework, achieving gains of upto 15\\% (PSNR) while\nreducing the model size by $\\sim$20 times.",

    "abstract": "Estimating treatment effects, especially individualized treatment effects\n(ITE), using observational data is challenging due to the complex situations of\nconfounding bias. Existing approaches for estimating treatment effects from\nlongitudinal observational data are usually built upon a strong assumption of\n\"unconfoundedness\", which is hard to fulfill in real-world practice. In this\npaper, we propose the Variational Temporal Deconfounder (VTD), an approach that\nleverages deep variational embeddings in the longitudinal setting using proxies\n(i.e., surrogate variables that serve for unobservable variables).\nSpecifically, VTD leverages observed proxies to learn a hidden embedding that\nreflects the true hidden confounders in the observational data. As such, our\nVTD method does not rely on the \"unconfoundedness\" assumption. We test our VTD\nmethod on both synthetic and real-world clinical data, and the results show\nthat our approach is effective when hidden confounding is the leading bias\ncompared to other existing models.",

    "title": "Learning Relaxation for Multigrid",
    "abstract": "During the last decade, Neural Networks (NNs) have proved to be extremely\neffective tools in many fields of engineering, including autonomous vehicles,\nmedical diagnosis and search engines, and even in art creation. Indeed, NNs\noften decisively outperform traditional algorithms. One area that is only\nrecently attracting significant interest is using NNs for designing numerical\nsolvers, particularly for discretized partial differential equations. Several\nrecent papers have considered employing NNs for developing multigrid methods,\nwhich are a leading computational tool for solving discretized partial\ndifferential equations and other sparse-matrix problems. We extend these new\nideas, focusing on so-called relaxation operators (also called smoothers),\nwhich are an important component of the multigrid algorithm that has not yet\nreceived much attention in this context. We explore an approach for using NNs\nto learn relaxation parameters for an ensemble of diffusion operators with\nrandom coefficients, for Jacobi type smoothers and for 4Color GaussSeidel\nsmoothers. The latter yield exceptionally efficient and easy to parallelize\nSuccessive Over Relaxation (SOR) smoothers. Moreover, this work demonstrates\nthat learning relaxation parameters on relatively small grids using a two-grid\nmethod and Gelfand's formula as a loss function can be implemented easily.\nThese methods efficiently produce nearly-optimal parameters, thereby\nsignificantly improving the convergence rate of multigrid algorithms on large\ngrids.",

    "abstract": "Continuous monitoring of trained ML models to determine when their\npredictions should and should not be trusted is essential for their safe\ndeployment. Such a framework ought to be high-performing, explainable, post-hoc\nand actionable. We propose TRUST-LAPSE, a \"mistrust\" scoring framework for\ncontinuous model monitoring. We assess the trustworthiness of each input\nsample's model prediction using a sequence of latent-space embeddings.\nSpecifically, (a) our latent-space mistrust score estimates mistrust using\ndistance metrics (Mahalanobis distance) and similarity metrics (cosine\nsimilarity) in the latent-space and (b) our sequential mistrust score\ndetermines deviations in correlations over the sequence of past input\nrepresentations in a non-parametric, sliding-window based algorithm for\nactionable continuous monitoring. We evaluate TRUST-LAPSE via two downstream\ntasks: (1) distributionally shifted input detection and (2) data drift\ndetection, across diverse domains -- audio & vision using public datasets and\nfurther benchmark our approach on challenging, real-world electroencephalograms\n(EEG) datasets for seizure detection. Our latent-space mistrust scores achieve\nstate-of-the-art results with AUROCs of 84.1 (vision), 73.9 (audio), 77.1\n(clinical EEGs), outperforming baselines by over 10 points. We expose critical\nfailures in popular baselines that remain insensitive to input semantic\ncontent, rendering them unfit for real-world model monitoring. We show that our\nsequential mistrust scores achieve high drift detection rates: over 90% of the\nstreams show < 20% error for all domains. Through extensive qualitative and\nquantitative evaluations, we show that our mistrust scores are more robust and\nprovide explainability for easy adoption into practice.",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown superiority in many prediction tasks\nover graphs due to their impressive capability of capturing nonlinear relations\nin graph-structured data. However, for node classification tasks, often, only\nmarginal improvement of GNNs over their linear counterparts has been observed.\nPrevious works provide very few understandings of this phenomenon. In this\nwork, we resort to Bayesian learning to deeply investigate the functions of\nnon-linearity in GNNs for node classification tasks. Given a graph generated\nfrom the statistical model CSBM, we observe that the max-a-posterior estimation\nof a node label given its own and neighbors' attributes consists of two types\nof non-linearity, a possibly non-linear transformation of node attributes and a\nReLU-activated feature aggregation from neighbors. The latter surprisingly\nmatches the type of non-linearity used in many GNN models. By further imposing\nGaussian assumption on node attributes, we prove that the superiority of those\nReLU activations is only significant when the node attributes are far more\ninformative than the graph structure, which nicely matches many previous\nempirical observations. A similar argument can be achieved when there is a\ndistribution shift of node attributes between the training and testing\ndatasets.

Recent advances in GPUs and distributed\ncomputing open a path to reduce the computational cost for GCNN training\neffectively.

We perform parallel training\non two open-source large-scale graph datasets to build a GCNN predictor for an\nimportant quantum property known as the HOMO-LUMO gap.

    "abstract": "Multi-person 3D pose estimation is a challenging task because of occlusion\nand depth ambiguity, especially in the cases of crowd scenes. To solve these\nproblems, most existing methods explore modeling body context cues by enhancing\nfeature representation with graph neural networks or adding structural\nconstraints. However, these methods are not robust for their single-root\nformulation that decoding 3D poses from a root node with a pre-defined graph.\nIn this paper, we propose GR-M3D, which models the \\textbf{M}ulti-person\n\\textbf{3D} pose estimation with dynamic \\textbf{G}raph \\textbf{R}easoning. The\ndecoding graph in GR-M3D is predicted instead of pre-defined. In particular, It\nfirstly generates several data maps and enhances them with a scale and depth\naware refinement module (SDAR). Then multiple root keypoints and dense decoding\npaths for each person are estimated from these data maps. Based on them,\ndynamic decoding graphs are built by assigning path weights to the decoding\npaths, while the path weights are inferred from those enhanced data maps. And\nthis process is named dynamic graph reasoning (DGR). Finally, the 3D poses are\ndecoded according to dynamic decoding graphs for each detected person. GR-M3D\ncan adjust the structure of the decoding graph implicitly by adopting soft path\nweights according to input data, which makes the decoding graphs be adaptive to\ndifferent input persons to the best extent and more capable of handling\nocclusion and depth ambiguity than previous methods. We empirically show that\nthe proposed bottom-up approach even outperforms top-down methods and achieves\nstate-of-the-art results on three 3D pose datasets.",

Three\nprominent heatmap methods are studied: Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP),\nIntegrated Gradients (IG), and Guided Grad-CAM (GGC). Contrary to prior studies\nwhere the quality of heatmaps was visually or qualitatively assessed, we\nobtained precise quantitative measures by computing overlap with a ground-truth\nmap from a large meta-analysis that combined 77 voxel-based morphometry (VBM)\nstudies independently from ADNI.

    "abstract": "While rich, open-domain textual data are generally available and may include\ninteresting phenomena (humor, sarcasm, empathy, etc.) most are designed for\nlanguage processing tasks, and are usually in a non-conversational format. In\nthis work, we take a step towards automatically generating conversational data\nusing Generative Conversational Networks, aiming to benefit from the breadth of\navailable language and knowledge data, and train open domain social\nconversational agents. We evaluate our approach on conversations with and\nwithout knowledge on the Topical Chat dataset using automatic metrics and human\nevaluators. Our results show that for conversations without knowledge\ngrounding, GCN can generalize from the seed data, producing novel conversations\nthat are less relevant but more engaging and for knowledge-grounded\nconversations, it can produce more knowledge-focused, fluent, and engaging\nconversations. Specifically, we show that for open-domain conversations with\n10\\% of seed data, our approach performs close to the baseline that uses 100%\nof the data, while for knowledge-grounded conversations, it achieves the same\nusing only 1% of the data, on human ratings of engagingness, fluency, and\nrelevance.",

We present an\napproach that links egocentric video and camera pose over time by learning\nrepresentations that are predictive of the camera-wearer's (potentially unseen)\nlocal surroundings to facilitate human-centric environment understanding.

    "abstract": "In the past decade, deep learning-based networks have achieved unprecedented\nsuccess in numerous tasks, including image classification. Despite this\nremarkable achievement, recent studies have demonstrated that such networks are\neasily fooled by small malicious perturbations, also known as adversarial\nexamples. This security weakness led to extensive research aimed at obtaining\nrobust models. Beyond the clear robustness benefits of such models, it was also\nobserved that their gradients with respect to the input align with human\nperception. Several works have identified Perceptually Aligned Gradients (PAG)\nas a byproduct of robust training, but none have considered it as a standalone\nphenomenon nor studied its own implications. In this work, we focus on this\ntrait and test whether Perceptually Aligned Gradients imply Robustness. To this\nend, we develop a novel objective to directly promote PAG in training\nclassifiers and examine whether models with such gradients are more robust to\nadversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and STL validate that\nsuch models have improved robust performance, exposing the surprising\nbidirectional connection between PAG and robustness.",

It is no longer far-fetched to envision a\nfuture where autonomous systems will be driving entire business decisions and,\nmore broadly, supporting large-scale decision-making infrastructure to solve\nsociety's most challenging problems. Issues of unfairness and discrimination\nare pervasive when decisions are being made by humans, and remain (or are\npotentially amplified) when decisions are made using machines with little\ntransparency, accountability, and fairness. In this paper, we introduce a\nframework for \\textit{causal fairness analysis} with the intent of filling in\nthis gap, i.e., understanding, modeling, and possibly solving issues of\nfairness in decision-making settings. The main insight of our approach will be\nto link the quantification of the disparities present on the observed data with\nthe underlying, and often unobserved, collection of causal mechanisms that\ngenerate the disparity in the first place, challenge we call the Fundamental\nProblem of Causal Fairness Analysis (FPCFA). In order to solve the FPCFA, we\nstudy the problem of decomposing variations and empirical measures of fairness\nthat attribute such variations to structural mechanisms and different units of\nthe population. Our effort culminates in the Fairness Map, which is the first\nsystematic attempt to organize and explain the relationship between different\ncriteria found in the literature. Finally, we study which causal assumptions\nare minimally needed for performing causal fairness analysis and propose a\nFairness Cookbook, which allows data scientists to assess the existence of\ndisparate impact and disparate treatment.",

In this paper, we propose a robust Orientation and Context\nEntangled Network (denoted as OCE-Net), which has the capability of extracting\ncomplex orientation and context information of the blood vessels. To achieve\ncomplex orientation aware, a Dynamic Complex Orientation Aware Convolution\n(DCOA Conv) is proposed to extract complex vessels with multiple orientations\nfor improving the vessel continuity.

    "abstract": "Visual Entailment with natural language explanations aims to infer the\nrelationship between a text-image pair and generate a sentence to explain the\ndecision-making process. Previous methods rely mainly on a pre-trained\nvision-language model to perform the relation inference and a language model to\ngenerate the corresponding explanation. However, the pre-trained\nvision-language models mainly build token-level alignment between text and\nimage yet ignore the high-level semantic alignment between the phrases (chunks)\nand visual contents, which is critical for vision-language reasoning. Moreover,\nthe explanation generator based only on the encoded joint representation does\nnot explicitly consider the critical decision-making points of relation\ninference. Thus the generated explanations are less faithful to visual-language\nreasoning. To mitigate these problems, we propose a unified Chunk-aware\nAlignment and Lexical Constraint based method, dubbed as CALeC. It contains a\nChunk-aware Semantic Interactor (arr. CSI), a relation inferrer, and a Lexical\nConstraint-aware Generator (arr. LeCG). Specifically, CSI exploits the sentence\nstructure inherent in language and various image regions to build chunk-aware\nsemantic alignment. Relation inferrer uses an attention-based reasoning network\nto incorporate the token-level and chunk-level vision-language representations.\nLeCG utilizes lexical constraints to expressly incorporate the words or chunks\nfocused by the relation inferrer into explanation generation, improving the\nfaithfulness and informativeness of the explanations.

    "abstract": "Traditional multi-view photometric stereo (MVPS) methods are often composed\nof multiple disjoint stages, resulting in noticeable accumulated errors. In\nthis paper, we present a neural inverse rendering method for MVPS based on\nimplicit representation. Given multi-view images of a non-Lambertian object\nilluminated by multiple unknown directional lights, our method jointly\nestimates the geometry, materials, and lights. Our method first employs\nmulti-light images to estimate per-view surface normal maps, which are used to\nregularize the normals derived from the neural radiance field. It then jointly\noptimizes the surface normals, spatially-varying BRDFs, and lights based on a\nshadow-aware differentiable rendering layer. After optimization, the\nreconstructed object can be used for novel-view rendering, relighting, and\nmaterial editing. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate\nthat our method achieves far more accurate shape reconstruction than existing\nMVPS and neural rendering methods.

    "abstract": "Entity alignment is a basic and vital technique in knowledge graph (KG)\nintegration. Over the years, research on entity alignment has resided on the\nassumption that KGs are static, which neglects the nature of growth of\nreal-world KGs. As KGs grow, previous alignment results face the need to be\nrevisited while new entity alignment waits to be discovered. In this paper, we\npropose and dive into a realistic yet unexplored setting, referred to as\ncontinual entity alignment. To avoid retraining an entire model on the whole\nKGs whenever new entities and triples come, we present a continual alignment\nmethod for this task. It reconstructs an entity's representation based on\nentity adjacency, enabling it to generate embeddings for new entities quickly\nand inductively using their existing neighbors. It selects and replays partial\npre-aligned entity pairs to train only parts of KGs while extracting\ntrustworthy alignment for knowledge augmentation. As growing KGs inevitably\ncontain non-matchable entities, different from previous works, the proposed\nmethod employs bidirectional nearest neighbor matching to find new entity\nalignment and update old alignment. Furthermore, we also construct new datasets\nby simulating the growth of multilingual DBpedia.

Specifically, to\nhandle various types of spatio-temporal conditional biases, our framework first\nconstructs a support set and a group of query sets from the training data,\nwhere the data distribution of each query set is different from that of the\nsupport set w.r.t. a type of conditional bias. Then, by performing a novel meta\ntraining and testing process to optimize the model to obtain good testing\nperformance on these query sets after training on the support set, our\nframework can effectively guide the model to learn to well generalize against\nbiases. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed\nframework.",

    "abstract": "Capturing the global topology of an image is essential for proposing an\naccurate segmentation of its domain. However, most of existing segmentation\nmethods do not preserve the initial topology of the given input, which is\ndetrimental for numerous downstream object-based tasks. This is all the more\ntrue for deep learning models which most work at local scales. In this paper,\nwe propose a new topology-preserving deep image segmentation method which\nrelies on a new leakage loss: the Pathloss. Our method is an extension of the\nBALoss [1], in which we want to improve the leakage detection for better\nrecovering the closeness property of the image segmentation. This loss allows\nus to correctly localize and fix the critical points (a leakage in the\nboundaries) that could occur in the predictions, and is based on a\nshortest-path search algorithm. This way, loss minimization enforces\nconnectivity only where it is necessary and finally provides a good\nlocalization of the boundaries of the objects in the image. Moreover, according\nto our research, our Pathloss learns to preserve stronger elongated structure\ncompared to methods without using topology-preserving loss. Training with our\ntopological loss function, our method outperforms state-of-the-art\ntopology-aware methods on two representative datasets of different natures:\nElectron Microscopy and Historical Map.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) supports distributed training of a global machine\nlearning model across multiple clients with the help from a central server. The\nlocal dataset held by each client is never exchanged in FL, so the local\ndataset privacy is protected. Although FL is increasingly popular, data\nheterogeneity across different clients leads to the client model drift issue\nand results in model performance degradation and poor model fairness. To\naddress the issue, we design Federated learning with global-local Knowledge\nFusion (FedKF) scheme in this paper. The key idea in FedKF is to let the server\nreturn the global knowledge to be fused with the local knowledge in each\ntraining round so that the local model can be regularized towards the global\noptima. Thus, the client model drift issue can be mitigated. In FedKF, we first\npropose the active-inactive model aggregation technique that supports a precise\nglobal knowledge representation. Then, we propose a data-free knowledge\ndistillation (KD) approach to facilitate the KD from the global model to the\nlocal model while the local model can still learn the local knowledge (embedded\nin the local dataset) simultaneously, thereby realizing the global-local\nknowledge fusion process. The theoretical analysis and intensive experiments\ndemonstrate that FedKF achieves high model performance, high fairness, and\nprivacy-preserving simultaneously.

Besides\nenhancing such aspects of place and mobility via spatio-temporal, we also\ninclude human aspects of these representations via considerations of the\nsociological notions of mobility via the mobilities paradigm that can\nsystematically introduce representation of both platial information along with\nmobilities associated with 'moving places.'

As\nillustrative cases for further study using platial mobility as a framework, we\nexplore its benefits and methodological aspects toward developing better\nunderstanding for disaster management, disaster risk reduction and pandemics.\nWe then discuss some of the illustrative use cases to clarify the concept of\nplatial mobility and its application prospects in the areas of disaster\nmanagement, disaster risk reduction and pandemics.

    "abstract": "Recently, most handwritten mathematical expression recognition (HMER) methods\nadopt the encoder-decoder networks, which directly predict the markup sequences\nfrom formula images with the attention mechanism. However, such methods may\nfail to accurately read formulas with complicated structure or generate long\nmarkup sequences, as the attention results are often inaccurate due to the\nlarge variance of writing styles or spatial layouts. To alleviate this problem,\nwe propose an unconventional network for HMER named Counting-Aware Network\n(CAN), which jointly optimizes two tasks: HMER and symbol counting.\nSpecifically, we design a weakly-supervised counting module that can predict\nthe number of each symbol class without the symbol-level position annotations,\nand then plug it into a typical attention-based encoder-decoder model for HMER.\nExperiments on the benchmark datasets for HMER validate that both joint\noptimization and counting results are beneficial for correcting the prediction\nerrors of encoder-decoder models, and CAN consistently outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods.

Social bots\nare assumed to be automated social media accounts operated by malicious actors\nwith the goal of manipulating public opinion. They are credited with the\nability to produce content autonomously and to interact with human users.\nSocial bot activity has been reported in many different political contexts,\nincluding the U.S. presidential elections, discussions about migration, climate\nchange, and COVID-19. However, the relevant publications either use crude and\nquestionable heuristics to discriminate between supposed social bots and humans\nor -- in the vast majority of the cases -- fully rely on the output of\nautomatic bot detection tools, most commonly Botometer. In this paper, we point\nout a fundamental theoretical flaw in the widely-used study design for\nestimating the prevalence of social bots. Furthermore, we empirically\ninvestigate the validity of peer-reviewed Botometer-based studies by closely\nand systematically inspecting hundreds of accounts that had been counted as\nsocial bots. We were unable to find a single social bot. Instead, we found\nmostly accounts undoubtedly operated by human users, the vast majority of them\nusing Twitter in an inconspicuous and unremarkable fashion without the\nslightest traces of automation.

    "abstract": "The pilot contamination in cell-free massive multiple-input-multiple-output\n(CF-mMIMO) must be addressed for accommodating a large number of users. We have\ninvestigated a decontamination method called subspace projection (SP). The SP\nseparates interference from co-pilot users by using the orthogonality of\nsubspaces of each users' principal components. The SP based decontamination has\na potential to further improve spectral efficiency (SE), which is limited by a\nnon-overloaded pilot assignment (PA) rule where each radio unit (RU) does not\nassign the same pilot to different users. Motivated by this limitation, this\npaper introduces semi-overloaded and overloaded PA methods adjusted for the\ndecontamination in order to improve the sum SE of CF systems. Numerical\nsimulations show that the overloaded and semi-overloaded PA give higher SE than\nthat of non-overloaded PA at a high user density scenario.",

Labels define object classes in\nthe image, as well as their locations, shape, and possibly other information\nsuch as pose. The labeling process has proven extremely time consuming, even\nwith the presence of manpower. We introduce a novel labeling tool for 2D images\nas well as 3D triangular meshes: 3D Labeling Tool (3DLT). This is a standalone,\nfeature-heavy and cross-platform software that does not require installation\nand can run on Windows, macOS and Linux-based distributions. Instead of\nlabeling the same object on every image separately like current tools, we use\ndepth information to reconstruct a triangular mesh from said images and label\nthe object only once on the aforementioned mesh. We use registration to\nsimplify 3D labeling, outlier detection to improve 2D bounding box calculation\nand surface reconstruction to expand labeling possibility to large point\nclouds. Our tool is tested against state of the art methods and it greatly\nsurpasses them in terms of speed while preserving accuracy and ease of use.",

With an\nincrease in available modalities, automatic understanding of emotions is being\nperformed more accurately. The success in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER),\nprimarily relies on the supervised learning paradigm. However, data annotation\nis expensive, time-consuming, and as emotion expression and perception depends\non several factors (e.g., age, gender, culture) obtaining labels with a high\nreliability is hard. Motivated by these, we focus on unsupervised feature\nlearning for MER. We consider discrete emotions, and as modalities text, audio\nand vision are used. Our method, as being based on contrastive loss between\npairwise modalities, is the first attempt in MER literature. Our end-to-end\nfeature learning approach has several differences (and advantages) compared to\nexisting MER methods: i) it is unsupervised, so the learning is lack of data\nlabelling cost; ii) it does not require data spatial augmentation, modality\nalignment, large number of batch size or epochs; iii) it applies data fusion\nonly at inference; and iv) it does not require backbones pre-trained on emotion\nrecognition task.

    "abstract": "Camera-captured document images usually suffer from perspective and geometric\ndeformations. It is of great value to rectify them when considering poor visual\naesthetics and the deteriorated performance of OCR systems. Recent\nlearning-based methods intensively focus on the accurately cropped document\nimage. However, this might not be sufficient for overcoming practical\nchallenges, including document images either with large marginal regions or\nwithout margins. Due to this impracticality, users struggle to crop documents\nprecisely when they encounter large marginal regions. Simultaneously, dewarping\nimages without margins is still an insurmountable problem. To the best of our\nknowledge, there is still no complete and effective pipeline for rectifying\ndocument images in the wild. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach\ncalled Marior (Margin Removal and \\Iterative Content Rectification). Marior\nfollows a progressive strategy to iteratively improve the dewarping quality and\nreadability in a coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, we divide the pipeline\ninto two modules: margin removal module (MRM) and iterative content\nrectification module (ICRM). First, we predict the segmentation mask of the\ninput image to remove the margin, thereby obtaining a preliminary result. Then\nwe refine the image further by producing dense displacement flows to achieve\ncontent-aware rectification. We determine the number of refinement iterations\nadaptively. Experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our\nmethod on public benchmarks. The resources are available at\nhttps://github.com/ZZZHANG-jx/Marior for further comparison.",

Although existing online KD methods achieve desirable performance, they\noften focus on class probabilities as the core knowledge type, ignoring the\nvaluable feature representational information. We present a Mutual Contrastive\nLearning (MCL) framework for online KD. The core idea of MCL is to perform\nmutual interaction and transfer of contrastive distributions among a cohort of\nnetworks in an online manner. Our MCL can aggregate cross-network embedding\ninformation and maximize the lower bound to the mutual information between two\nnetworks. This enables each network to learn extra contrastive knowledge from\nothers, leading to better feature representations, thus improving the\nperformance of visual recognition tasks. Beyond the final layer, we extend MCL\nto several intermediate layers assisted by auxiliary feature refinement\nmodules. This further enhances the ability of representation learning for\nonline KD. Experiments on image classification and transfer learning to visual\nrecognition tasks show that MCL can lead to consistent performance gains\nagainst state-of-the-art online KD approaches. The superiority demonstrates\nthat MCL can guide the network to generate better feature representations. Our\ncode is publicly available at https://github.com/winycg/MCL.",

    "title": "Bandwidth-Hard Functions from Random Permutations",
    "abstract": "ASIC hash engines are specifically optimized for parallel computations of\ncryptographic hashes and thus a natural environment for mounting brute-force\nattacks on hash functions. Two fundamental advantages of ASICs over general\npurpose computers are the area advantage and the energy efficiency. The\nmemory-hard functions approach the problem by reducing the area advantage of\nASICs compared to general-purpose computers. Traditionally, memory-hard\nfunctions have been analyzed in the (parallel) random oracle model. However, as\nthe memory-hard security game is multi-stage, indifferentiability does not\napply and instantiating the random oracle becomes a non-trivial problem. Chen\nand Tessaro (CRYPTO 2019) considered this issue and showed how random oracles\nshould be instantiated in the context of memory-hard functions. The\nBandwidth-Hard functions, introduced by Ren and Devadas (TCC 2017), aim to\nprovide ASIC resistance by reducing the energy advantage of ASICs. In\nparticular, bandwidth-hard functions provide ASIC resistance by guaranteeing\nhigh run time energy cost if the available cache is not large enough.\nPreviously, bandwidth-hard functions have been analyzed in the parallel random\noracle model. In this work, we show how those random oracles can be\ninstantiated using random permutations in the context of bandwidth-hard\nfunctions. Our results are generic and valid for any hard-to-pebble graphs.",

    "abstract": "Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines have been an important\ntopic in public discourse. The discussions around vaccines are polarized as\nsome see them as an important measure to end the pandemic, and others are\nhesitant or find them harmful. This study investigates posts related to\nCOVID-19 vaccines on Twitter and focuses on those which have a negative stance\ntoward vaccines. A dataset of 16,713,238 English tweets related to COVID-19\nvaccines was collected covering the period from March 1, 2020, to July 31,\n2021. We used the Scikit-learn Python library to apply a support vector machine\n(SVM) classifier to identify the tweets with a negative stance toward the\nCOVID-19 vaccines. A total of 5,163 tweets were used to train the classifier,\nout of which a subset of 2,484 tweets were manually annotated by us and made\npublicly available. We used the BERTtopic model to extract and investigate the\ntopics discussed within the negative tweets and how they changed over time. We\nshow that the negativity with respect to COVID-19 vaccines has decreased over\ntime along with the vaccine roll-outs. We identify 37 topics of discussion and\npresent their respective importance over time. We show that popular topics\nconsist of conspiratorial discussions such as 5G towers and microchips, but\nalso contain legitimate concerns around vaccination safety and side effects as\nwell as concerns about policies. Our study shows that even unpopular opinions\nor conspiracy theories can become widespread when paired with a widely popular\ndiscussion topic such as COVID-19 vaccines. Understanding the concerns and the\ndiscussed topics and how they change over time is essential for policymakers\nand public health authorities to provide better and in-time information and\npolicies, to facilitate vaccination of the population in future similar crises.",

Our simulation results indicate that the proposed puncturing scheme\nachieves a stable shaping gain across the signal-to-noise ratio of at least 0.6\ndB compared with the uniform case under the same throughput, while the gain of\nsequential puncturing drops rapidly with retransmissions. Moreover, in each\ntransmission, the proposed scheme is able to reduce the distribution distortion\nthat achieves over 1.2 dB gain at a block error rate (BLER) of ${10^{-3}}$. In\ncontrast, for sequential puncturing, the distribution is severely distorted and\nthe BLER performance is even worse than that of the uniform case in\nretransmissions.",

However, the issues\nof massiveness, heterogeneity, and semantic redundancy have become the biggest\nchallenges in event-based security analysis. Unfortunately, there is no\ncomprehensive tool to collect and analyze its kernel logs for the widely used\nOS Windows. This paper proposes a kernel-based event log collector named\nKellect, a multi-thread tool built on ETW(events tracing for Windwos). Kellect\ncan provide very compressed but most valuable kernel event data for\ngeneral-purpose analysis on software anomaly detection. Experimental results in\nreal-world show that Kellect can collect kernel event logs generated from\nFileIO, Process, Thread, Images, Register, and Network, with efficient and\nlossless. The total performance is three times higher than that of existing\ntools. The CPU cost stays only at around 1%, while the memory consumption is\nless than 50MB. As an important application case, the data collected by Kellect\nis proved to be utilized to build proper model to detect APT after transformed\ninto provenance graphs with complete semantics. At last, a large experiments\nfor the full techniques from ATT&CK are conducted, and the full relevant log\ndataset is collected using Kellect.

The Dice\nscores and area under the curve (AUC) for differentiating normal, PD, and\nP-plus cases were calculated. The segmentation times of V-Net and UNETR for the\nsix brain structures per patient were 3.48 +- 0.17 and 48.14 +- 0.97 s,\nrespectively, being at least 300 times faster than FS (15,735 +- 1.07 s).

For classification of\nnormal vs. P-plus and PD vs. multiple systemic atrophy (cerebellar type), the\nDL models and FS showed AUCs above 0.8.

In this work, orthogonal arrays are\nused, similar to the Taguchi method, to efficiently span the joint space with\nthe minimal number of training images. This ``optimally'' generated database is\nused to train the custom ANN and its degree of accuracy is on average equal to\ntwice the smallest joint displacement step used for database generation.

    "abstract": "In the last years, there has been significant progress in the field of 3D\nlearning on classification, detection and segmentation problems. The vast\nmajority of the existing studies focus on canonical closed-set conditions,\nneglecting the intrinsic open nature of the real-world. This limits the\nabilities of autonomous systems involved in safety-critical applications that\nrequire managing novel and unknown signals. In this context exploiting 3D data\ncan be a valuable asset since it conveys rich information about the geometry of\nsensed objects and scenes. This paper provides the first broad study on Open\nSet 3D learning. We introduce a novel testbed with settings of increasing\ndifficulty in terms of category semantic shift and cover both in-domain\n(synthetic-to-synthetic) and cross-domain (synthetic-to-real) scenarios.\nMoreover, we investigate the related out-of-distribution and Open Set 2D\nliterature to understand if and how their most recent approaches are effective\non 3D data. Our extensive benchmark positions several algorithms in the same\ncoherent picture, revealing their strengths and limitations. The results of our\nanalysis may serve as a reliable foothold for future tailored Open Set 3D\nmodels.",

    "abstract": "Multi-view Spectral Clustering (MvSC) attracts increasing attention due to\ndiverse data sources. However, most existing works are prohibited in\nout-of-sample predictions and overlook model interpretability and exploration\nof clustering results. In this paper, a new method for MvSC is proposed via a\nshared latent space from the Restricted Kernel Machine framework. Through the\nlens of conjugate feature duality, we cast the weighted kernel principal\ncomponent analysis problem for MvSC and develop a modified weighted conjugate\nfeature duality to formulate dual variables. In our method, the dual variables,\nplaying the role of hidden features, are shared by all views to construct a\ncommon latent space, coupling the views by learning projections from\nview-specific spaces. Such single latent space promotes well-separated clusters\nand provides straightforward data exploration, facilitating visualization and\ninterpretation. Our method requires only a single eigendecomposition, whose\ndimension is independent of the number of views. To boost higher-order\ncorrelations, tensor-based modelling is introduced without increasing\ncomputational complexity. Our method can be flexibly applied with out-of-sample\nextensions, enabling greatly improved efficiency for large-scale data with\nfixed-size kernel schemes. Numerical experiments verify that our method is\neffective regarding accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability, showing a sharp\neigenvalue decay and distinct latent variable distributions.",

Although many\nclassification models have been proposed based on statistical learning methods\nshowing good results, reasoning behind the classification performances may not\nbe enough. In the self-supervised learning studies, it has been highlighted\nthat a quality of representation (embedding) space matters and directly affects\na downstream task performance. In this study, a quality of the representation\nspace is analyzed visually and analytically in terms of linear separability for\ndifferent classes on a real and fake news dataset. To further add\ninterpretability to a classification model, a modification of Class Activation\nMapping (CAM) is proposed. The modified CAM provides a CAM score for each word\ntoken, where the CAM score on a word token denotes a level of focus on that\nword token to make the prediction.

In this paper, we evaluate how ML bias\nmanifests in robots that physically and autonomously act within the world. We\naudit one of several recently published CLIP-powered robotic manipulation\nmethods, presenting it with objects that have pictures of human faces on the\nsurface which vary across race and gender, alongside task descriptions that\ncontain terms associated with common stereotypes. Our experiments definitively\nshow robots acting out toxic stereotypes with respect to gender, race, and\nscientifically-discredited physiognomy, at scale. Furthermore, the audited\nmethods are less likely to recognize Women and People of Color. Our\ninterdisciplinary sociotechnical analysis synthesizes across fields and\napplications such as Science Technology and Society (STS), Critical Studies,\nHistory, Safety, Robotics, and AI. We find that robots powered by large\ndatasets and Dissolution Models (sometimes called \"foundation models\", e.g.\nCLIP) that contain humans risk physically amplifying malignant stereotypes in\ngeneral; and that merely correcting disparities will be insufficient for the\ncomplexity and scale of the problem. Instead, we recommend that robot learning\nmethods that physically manifest stereotypes or other harmful outcomes be\npaused, reworked, or even wound down when appropriate, until outcomes can be\nproven safe, effective, and just.

To simulate\nadversarial workloads, we carry out a data poisoning attack on linear\nregression models that manipulates the cumulative distribution function (CDF)\non which the learned index model is trained. The attack deteriorates the fit of\nthe underlying ML model by injecting a set of poisoning keys into the training\ndataset, which leads to an increase in the prediction error of the model and\nthus deteriorates the overall performance of the learned index structure. We\nassess the performance of various regression methods and the learned index\nimplementations ALEX and PGM-Index. We show that learned index structures can\nsuffer from a significant performance deterioration of up to 20% when evaluated\non poisoned vs. non-poisoned datasets.",

Most often, a model trained for one market or security cannot be\ndirectly applied to another market or security due to differences inherent in\nthe market conditions. In addition, as the market evolves through time, it is\nnecessary to update the existing models or train new ones when new data is made\navailable. This scenario, which is inherent in most financial forecasting\napplications, naturally raises the following research question: How to\nefficiently adapt a pre-trained model to a new set of data while retaining\nperformance on the old data, especially when the old data is not accessible? In\nthis paper, we propose a method to efficiently retain the knowledge available\nin a neural network pre-trained on a set of securities and adapt it to achieve\nhigh performance in new ones. In our method, the prior knowledge encoded in a\npre-trained neural network is maintained by keeping existing connections fixed,\nand this knowledge is adjusted for the new securities by a set of augmented\nconnections, which are optimized using the new data. The auxiliary connections\nare constrained to be of low rank.

    "abstract": "We first extend the construction of generalized barycentric coordinates (GBC)\nbased on the vertices on the boundary of a polygon $\\Omega$ to a new kind of\nGBCs based on vertices inside the $\\Omega$ of interest. For clarity, the\nstandard GBCs are called boundary GBCs while the new GBCs are called interior\nGBCs. Then we present an analysis on these two kinds of harmonic GBCs to show\nthat each GBC function whose value is $1$ at a vertex (boundary or interior\nvertex of $\\Omega$) decays to zero away from its supporting vertex\nexponentially fast except for a trivial example. Based on the exponential decay\nproperty, we explain how to approximate the harmonic GBC functions locally.\nThat is, due to the locality of these two kinds of GBCs, one can approximate\neach of\nthese GBC functions by its local versions which is supported over a\nsub-domain of $\\Omega$. The local version of these GBC function will help\nreduce the computational time for shape deformation in graphical design. Next,\nwith these two kinds of GBC functions at hand, we can use them to approximate\nthe solution of the Dirichlet problem of the Poisson equation. This may provide\na more efficient way to solve the Poisson equation by using a computer which\nhas graphical processing unit(GPU) with thousands or more processes than the\nstandard methods using a computer with one or few CPU kernels.",

    "abstract": "We present a non-asymptotic lower bound on the eigenspectrum of the design\nmatrix generated by any linear bandit algorithm with sub-linear regret when the\naction set has well-behaved curvature. Specifically, we show that the minimum\neigenvalue of the expected design matrix grows as $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$ whenever\nthe expected cumulative regret of the algorithm is $O(\\sqrt{n})$, where $n$ is\nthe learning horizon, and the action-space has a constant Hessian around the\noptimal arm. This shows that such action-spaces force a polynomial lower bound\nrather than a logarithmic lower bound, as shown by \\cite{lattimore2017end}, in\ndiscrete (i.e., well-separated) action spaces. Furthermore, while the previous\nresult is shown to hold only in the asymptotic regime (as $n \\to \\infty$), our\nresult for these ``locally rich\" action spaces is any-time. Additionally, under\na mild technical assumption, we obtain a similar lower bound on the minimum\neigen value holding with high probability.\nWe apply our result to two practical scenarios -- \\emph{model selection} and\n\\emph{clustering} in linear bandits. For model selection, we show that an\nepoch-based linear bandit algorithm adapts to the true model complexity at a\nrate exponential in the number of epochs, by virtue of our novel spectral\nbound. For clustering, we consider a multi agent framework where we show, by\nleveraging the spectral result, that no forced exploration is necessary -- the\nagents can run a linear bandit algorithm and estimate their underlying\nparameters at once, and hence incur a low regret.",

    "abstract": "Recall that most of the current image style transfer methods require the user\nto give an image of a particular style and then extract that styling feature\nand texture to generate the style of an image, but there are still some\nproblems: the user may not have a reference style image, or it may be difficult\nto summarise the desired style in mind with just one image. The recently\nproposed CLIPstyler has solved this problem, which is able to perform style\ntransfer based only on the provided description of the style image. Although\nCLIPstyler can achieve good performance when landscapes or portraits appear\nalone, it can blur the people and lose the original semantics when people and\nlandscapes coexist. Based on these issues, we demonstrate a novel framework\nthat uses a pre-trained CLIP text-image embedding model and guides image style\ntransfer through an FCN semantic segmentation network. Specifically, we solve\nthe portrait over-styling problem for both selfies and real-world landscape\nwith human subjects photos, enhance the contrast between the effect of style\ntransfer in portrait and landscape, and make the degree of image style transfer\nin different semantic parts fully controllable. Our Generative Artisan resolve\nthe failure case of CLIPstyler and yield both qualitative and quantitative\nmethods to prove ours have much better results than CLIPstyler in both selfies\nand real-world landscape with human subjects photos.

The thematic analysis resulted in five main challenges: becoming a\nprofessional TA, student focused challenges, assessment, defining and using\nbest practice, and threats to best practice. In addition, these challenges were\nall identified within the essays from all three institutions, indicating that\nthe identified challenges are not particularly context-dependent.

Adjusting courses on embedded systems and\nmicro-controllers was extra challenging since interaction with real hardware is\ntheir integral part. We start by comparing our experience with four basic\nalternatives of teaching embedded systems: 1) interacting with hardware at\nschool, 2) having remote access to hardware, 3) lending hardware to students\nfor at-home work and 4) virtualizing hardware. Afterward, we evaluate in detail\nour experience of the fast transition from traditional, offline at-school\nhardware programming course to using remote access to real hardware present in\nthe lab. The somewhat unusual remote hardware access approach turned out to be\na fully viable alternative for teaching embedded systems, enabling a relatively\nlow-effort transition. Our setup is based on existing solutions and stable open\ntechnologies without the need for custom-developed applications that require\nhigh maintenance. We evaluate the experience of both the students and teachers\nand condense takeaways for future courses. The specific environment setup is\navailable online as an inspiration for others.",

Due to their high dynamic range, pixel\nbandwidth, temporal resolution, low power consumption, and computational\nsimplicity, they are beneficial for vision-based projects in challenging\nlighting conditions and they can detect fast movements with their microsecond\nresponse time. The first generation of ECs are monochrome, but color data is\nvery useful and sometimes essential for certain vision-based applications. The\nlatest technology enables manufacturers to build color ECs, trading off the\nsize of the sensor and substantially reducing the resolution compared to\nmonochrome models, despite having the same bandwidth. In addition, ECs only\ndetect changes in light and do not show static or slowly moving objects. We\nintroduce a method to detect full RGB events using a monochrome EC aided by a\nstructured light projector. The projector emits rapidly changing RGB patterns\nof light beams on the scene, the reflection of which is captured by the EC. We\ncombine the benefits of ECs and projection-based techniques and allow depth and\ncolor detection of static or moving objects with a commercial TI LightCrafter\n4500 projector and a monocular monochrome EC, paving the way for frameless\nRGB-D sensing applications.",

This paper examines the effect of\ntemporal bias, defined as the difference between users' check-in hours, leisure\nvs.~work hours, on the consumer-side fairness of context-aware recommendation\nalgorithms. We believe that eliminating this type of temporal (and\ngeographical) bias might contribute to a drop in traffic-related air pollution,\nnoting that rush-hour traffic may be more congested. To surface effective POI\nrecommendations, we evaluated the sensitivity of state-of-the-art context-aware\nmodels to the temporal bias contained in users' check-in activities on two POI\ndatasets, namely Gowalla and Yelp. The findings show that the examined\ncontext-aware recommendation models prefer one group of users over another\nbased on the time of check-in and that this preference persists even when users\nhave the same amount of interactions.",

Little is known about perceptions of flawed\ncertificates by IT professionals, even though their decisions impact high\nnumbers of end users. Moreover, it is unclear how much the content of error\nmessages and documentation influences these perceptions. To shed light on these\nissues, we observed 75 attendees of an industrial IT conference investigating\ndifferent certificate validation errors. We also analyzed the influence of\nreworded error messages and redesigned documentation. We find that people\nworking in IT have very nuanced opinions, with trust decisions being far from\nbinary. The self-signed and the name-constrained certificates seem to be\nover-trusted (the latter also being poorly understood).

    "abstract": "Payment channel networks (PCNs) enhance the scalability of blockchains by\nallowing parties to conduct transactions off-chain, i.e, without broadcasting\nevery transaction to all blockchain participants. To conduct transactions, a\nsender and a receiver can either establish a direct payment channel with a\nfunding blockchain transaction or leverage existing channels in a multi-hop\npayment. The security of PCNs usually relies on the synchrony of the underlying\nblockchain, i.e., evidence of misbehavior needs to be published on the\nblockchain within a time limit. Alternative payment channel proposals that do\nnot require blockchain synchrony rely on quorum certificates and use a\ncommittee to register the transactions of a channel. However, these proposals\ndo not support multi-hop payments, a limitation we aim to overcome. In this\npaper, we demonstrate that it is in fact impossible to design a multi-hop\npayment protocol with both network asynchrony and faulty channels, i.e.,\nchannels that may not correctly follow the protocol. We then detail two\ncommittee-based multi-hop payment protocols that respectively assume\nsynchronous communications and possibly faulty channels, or asynchronous\ncommunication and correct channels. The first protocol relies on possibly\nfaulty committees instead of the blockchain to resolve channel disputes, and\nenforces privacy properties within a synchronous network. The second one relies\non committees that contain at most f faulty members out of 3f+1 and\nsuccessively delegate to each other the role of eventually completing a\nmulti-hop payment.

While we have witnessed great progress in\nimage deblurring in recent years, most methods require significant\ncomputational power and have limitations in processing high-resolution photos\nwith severe local motions. To this end, we develop a novel face deblurring\nsystem based on the dual camera fusion technique for mobile phones.

While the main shot\nis low noise but blurry, the reference shot is sharp but noisy. We learn ML\nmodels to align and fuse these two shots and output a clear photo without\nmotion blur. Our algorithm runs efficiently on Google Pixel 6, which takes 463\nms overhead per shot. Our experiments demonstrate the advantage and robustness\nof our system against alternative single-image, multi-frame, face-specific, and\nvideo deblurring algorithms as well as commercial products.

    "abstract": "Falls, highly common in the constantly increasing global aging population,\ncan have a variety of negative effects on their health, well-being, and quality\nof life, including restricting their capabilities to conduct Activities of\nDaily Living (ADLs), which are crucial for one's sustenance. Timely assistance\nduring falls is highly necessary, which involves tracking the indoor location\nof the elderly during their diverse navigational patterns associated with ADLs\nto detect the precise location of a fall. With the decreasing caregiver\npopulation on a global scale, it is important that the future of intelligent\nliving environments can detect falls during ADLs while being able to track the\nindoor location of the elderly in the real world. To address these challenges,\nthis work proposes a cost-effective and simplistic design paradigm for an\nAmbient Assisted Living system that can capture multimodal components of user\nbehaviors during ADLs that are necessary for performing fall detection and\nindoor localization in a simultaneous manner in the real world. Proof of\nconcept results from real-world experiments are presented to uphold the\neffective working of the system. The findings from two comparison studies with\nprior works in this field are also presented to uphold the novelty of this\nwork. The first comparison study shows how the proposed system outperforms\nprior works in the areas of indoor localization and fall detection in terms of\nthe effectiveness of its software design and hardware design. The second\ncomparison study shows that the cost for the development of this system is the\nleast as compared to prior works in these fields, which involved real-world\ndevelopment of the underlining systems, thereby upholding its cost-effective\nnature.",

    "abstract": "Background: Code reviewing is an essential part of software development to\nensure software quality. However, the abundance of review tasks and the\nintensity of the workload for reviewers negatively impact the quality of the\nreviews. The short review text is often unactionable, which needs further\ninteraction between the reviewer and the developer. The problem becomes more\ncritical in dynamic teams and in the case of new team members who are less\nfamiliar with their reviewers and perspectives. Aims: We are proposing the\nExample Driven Review Explanation (EDRE) method to facilitate the code review\nprocess by adding additional explanations through examples. EDRE recommends\nsimilar code reviews as examples to further explain a review and help a\ndeveloper to understand the received reviews with less communication overhead.\nMethod: Through an empirical study in an industrial setting and by analyzing\n3,722 code reviews across three open-source projects, we compared five methods\nof data retrieval, text classification, and text recommendation. Results: EDRE\nusing TF-IDF word embedding along with an SVM classifier can provide practical\nexamples for each code review with 92% F-score and 90% Accuracy.

In addition, with massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)\nantenna arrays employed at BSs, the beamspace channel is sparse for each user,\nand thus there is no need to serve all the users in a cell by all the beams\ntherein jointly. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to develop a flexible\nclustered cell-free networking scheme that can decompose the whole network into\na number of weakly interfered small subnetworks operating independently and in\nparallel.

    "abstract": "Scene inference under low-light is a challenging problem due to severe noise\nin the captured images. One way to reduce noise is to use longer exposure\nduring the capture. However, in the presence of motion (scene or camera\nmotion), longer exposures lead to motion blur, resulting in loss of image\ninformation. This creates a trade-off between these two kinds of image\ndegradations: motion blur (due to long exposure) vs. noise (due to short\nexposure), also referred as a dual image corruption pair in this paper. With\nthe rise of cameras capable of capturing multiple exposures of the same scene\nsimultaneously, it is possible to overcome this trade-off. Our key observation\nis that although the amount and nature of degradation varies for these\ndifferent image captures, the semantic content remains the same across all\nimages. To this end, we propose a method to leverage these multi exposure\ncaptures for robust inference under low-light and motion. Our method builds on\na feature consistency loss to encourage similar results from these individual\ncaptures, and uses the ensemble of their final predictions for robust visual\nrecognition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on simulated\nimages as well as real captures with multiple exposures, and across the tasks\nof object detection and image classification.",

    "abstract": "Wildfires are a highly prevalent multi-causal environmental phenomenon. The\nimpact of this phenomenon includes human losses, environmental damage and high\neconomic costs. To mitigate these effects, several computer simulation systems\nhave been developed in order to predict fire behavior based on a set of input\nparameters, also called a scenario (wind speed and direction; temperature;\netc.). However, the results of a simulation usually have a high degree of error\ndue to the uncertainty in the values of some variables, because they are not\nknown, or because their measurement may be imprecise, erroneous, or impossible\nto perform in real time. Previous works have proposed the combination of\nmultiple results in order to reduce this uncertainty.

Although these methods have\nshown improvements in the quality of predictions, they have some limitations\nrelated to the algorithms used for the selection of scenarios. To overcome\nthese limitations, in this work we propose to apply the Novelty Search\nparadigm, which replaces the objective function by a measure of the novelty of\nthe solutions found, which allows the search to continuously generate solutions\nwith behaviors that differ from one another.

Inspired by the idea of\ninsurance, we innovatively propose a decentralized file storage protocol in\nblockchain, named as FileInsurer, to achieve both scalability and reliability.\nWhile ensuring scalability by distributed storage, FileInsurer guarantees\nreliability by enhancing robustness and fully compensating for the file loss.\nSpecifically, under mild conditions, we prove that no more than 0.1\\% value of\nall files should be compensated even if half of the storage collapses.\nTherefore, only a relatively small deposit needs to be pledged by storage\nproviders to cover the potential file loss. Because of lower burdens of\ndeposit, storage providers have more incentives to participate in the storage\nnetwork.

Recent progress in masked video modelling, i.e.,\nVideoMAE, has shown the ability of vanilla Vision Transformers (ViT) to\ncomplement spatio-temporal contexts given only limited visual contents.\nInspired by this, we propose propose Masked Action Recognition (MAR), which\nreduces the redundant computation by discarding a proportion of patches and\noperating only on a part of the videos. MAR contains the following two\nindispensable components: cell running masking and bridging classifier.\nSpecifically, to enable the ViT to perceive the details beyond the visible\npatches easily, cell running masking is presented to preserve the\nspatio-temporal correlations in videos, which ensures the patches at the same\nspatial location can be observed in turn for easy reconstructions.\nAdditionally, we notice that, although the partially observed features can\nreconstruct semantically explicit invisible patches, they fail to achieve\naccurate classification. To address this, a bridging classifier is proposed to\nbridge the semantic gap between the ViT encoded features for reconstruction and\nthe features specialized for classification. Our proposed MAR reduces the\ncomputational cost of ViT by 53% and extensive experiments show that MAR\nconsistently outperforms existing ViT models with a notable margin.

The system\nis shown to be stable for constant output voltage operation for the entire\npower range while unstable for the constant power load (CPL) operation for load\ndemands close to the system maximum power. It is also shown that the\ntransformer winding current are part of the zero dynamic states and was shown\nto be always stable regardless of the operating conditions of the system.",

Different scoring functions can lead to huge differences in link\nprediction performances on different knowledge graphs. In this report, we\ndescribe a weird scoring function found by random search on the open graph\nbenchmark (OGB). This scoring function, called AutoWeird, only uses tail entity\nand relation in a triplet to compute its plausibility score. Experimental\nresults show that AutoWeird achieves top-1 performance on ogbl-wikikg2 data\nset, but has much worse performance than other methods on ogbl-biokg data set.\nBy analyzing the tail entity distribution and evaluation protocol of these two\ndata sets, we attribute the unexpected success of AutoWeird on ogbl-wikikg2 to\ninappropriate evaluation and concentrated tail entity distribution. Such\nresults may motivate further research on how to accurately evaluate the\nperformance of different link prediction methods for knowledge graphs.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies a novel privacy-preserving anonymization problem for\npedestrian images, which preserves personal identity information (PII) for\nauthorized models and prevents PII from being recognized by third parties.\nConventional anonymization methods unavoidably cause semantic information loss,\nleading to limited data utility. Besides, existing learned anonymization\ntechniques, while retaining various identity-irrelevant utilities, will change\nthe pedestrian identity, and thus are unsuitable for training robust\nre-identification models. To explore the privacy-utility trade-off for\npedestrian images, we propose a joint learning reversible anonymization\nframework, which can reversibly generate full-body anonymous images with little\nperformance drop on person re-identification tasks. The core idea is that we\nadopt desensitized images generated by conventional methods as the initial\nprivacy-preserving supervision and jointly train an anonymization encoder with\na recovery decoder and an identity-invariant model. We further propose a\nprogressive training strategy to improve the performance, which iteratively\nupgrades the initial anonymization supervision. Experiments further demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our anonymized pedestrian images for privacy protection,\nwhich boosts the re-identification performance while preserving privacy.

    "abstract": "Pre-trained models have been shown effective in many code intelligence tasks.\nThese models are pre-trained on large-scale unlabeled corpus and then\nfine-tuned in downstream tasks. However, as the inputs to pre-training and\ndownstream tasks are in different forms, it is hard to fully explore the\nknowledge of pre-trained models. Besides, the performance of fine-tuning\nstrongly relies on the amount of downstream data, while in practice, the\nscenarios with scarce data are common. Recent studies in the natural language\nprocessing (NLP) field show that prompt tuning, a new paradigm for tuning,\nalleviates the above issues and achieves promising results in various NLP\ntasks. In prompt tuning, the prompts inserted during tuning provide\ntask-specific knowledge, which is especially beneficial for tasks with\nrelatively scarce data. In this paper, we empirically evaluate the usage and\neffect of prompt tuning in code intelligence tasks. We conduct prompt tuning on\npopular pre-trained models CodeBERT and CodeT5 and experiment with three code\nintelligence tasks including defect prediction, code summarization, and code\ntranslation. Our experimental results show that prompt tuning consistently\noutperforms fine-tuning in all three tasks. In addition, prompt tuning shows\ngreat potential in low-resource scenarios, e.g., improving the BLEU scores of\nfine-tuning by more than 26\\% on average for code summarization. Our results\nsuggest that instead of fine-tuning, we could adapt prompt tuning for code\nintelligence tasks to achieve better performance, especially when lacking\ntask-specific data.",

While the clinical decision support\nsystems (CDSS) can help medical personnel make better decisions, they may bring\nnegative results due to a lack of understanding of the elements that influence\nGP's adoption of CDSS. This paper focuses on discovering obstacles that may\ncontribute to the problems surrounding CDSS adoption. Thirty general\npractitioners were interviewed from different primary health centers in Saudi\nArabia in order to determine the challenges and obstacles in the sector. While\nthe outcome confirms that there are obstacles that affect the aspects, such as\ntime risk, quality of the system used, slow Internet speed, user interface,\nlack of training, high costs, patient satisfaction, multiple systems used,\ntechnical support, computer skills, lack of flexibility, system update,\nprofessional skills and knowledge, computer efficiency and quality and accuracy\nof data.",

    "abstract": "Due to its minimal energy requirement the PoS consensus protocol has become\nan attractive alternative to PoW in modern cryptocurrencies. In this protocol\nthe chance of being selected as a block proposer in each round is proportional\nto the current stake of any node. Thus, nodes with higher stakes will achieve\nmore block rewards, resulting in the so-called rich-getting-richer problem. In\nthis paper, we introduce a new block reward mechanism called the FRD (Fair\nReward Distribution) mechanism, in which for each block produced, in addition\nto a major reward given to the block proposer, a small reward is given to all\nother nodes. We prove that this reward mechanism makes the PoS protocol fairer\nin terms of concentration of wealth by developing on the Bagchi-Pal urn model.",

In this survey, we first\ngive a formal definition of the gradient-based bi-level optimization.

With a bi-level formulation, we then discuss four bi-level\noptimization solvers to update the outer variable including explicit gradient\nupdate, proxy update, implicit function update, and closed-form update.

They may face problems when dealing with\ndifferent perturbations on different semantic regions without available input\nmasks. To deal with the problem that one image has been pasted with several\nforegrounds coming from different images and needs to harmonize them towards\ndifferent domain directions without any mask as input, we propose a new\nsemantic-guided multi-mask image harmonization task. Different from the\nprevious single-mask image harmonization task, each inharmonious image is\nperturbed with different methods according to the semantic segmentation masks.\nTwo challenging benchmarks, HScene and HLIP, are constructed based on $150$ and\n$19$ semantic classes, respectively. Furthermore, previous baselines focus on\nregressing the exact value for each pixel of the harmonized images. The\ngenerated results are in the `black box' and cannot be edited. In this work, we\npropose a novel way to edit the inharmonious images by predicting a series of\noperator masks. The masks indicate the level and the position to apply a\ncertain image editing operation, which could be the brightness, the saturation,\nand the color in a specific dimension. The operator masks provide more\nflexibility for users to edit the image further. Extensive experiments verify\nthat the operator mask-based network can further improve those state-of-the-art\nmethods which directly regress RGB images when the perturbations are\nstructural. Experiments have been conducted on our constructed benchmarks to\nverify that our proposed operator mask-based framework can locate and modify\nthe inharmonious regions in more complex scenes.

To ensure safety, it is crucial to develop\nan adaptive decision making system that can handle the interaction with other\nvehicles. Manually designed model-based methods are reliable in common\nscenarios. But in uncertain environments, they are not reliable, so\nlearning-based methods are proposed, especially reinforcement learning (RL)\nmethods. However, current RL methods need retraining when the scenarios change.\nIn other words, current RL methods cannot reuse accumulated knowledge.

The proposed method combines the idea of motion primitives (MPs)\nwith hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL). It decomposes complex problems\ninto multiple basic subtasks to reduce the difficulty. The proposed method and\nother baseline methods are tested in a challenging intersection scenario based\non the CARLA simulator. The intersection scenario contains three different\nsubtasks that can reflect the complexity and uncertainty of real traffic flow.\nAfter offline learning and testing, the proposed method is proved to have the\nbest performance among all methods.",

    "abstract": "Videos obtained by rolling-shutter (RS) cameras result in spatially-distorted\nframes. These distortions become significant under fast camera/scene motions.\nUndoing effects of RS is sometimes addressed as a spatial problem, where\nobjects need to be rectified/displaced in order to generate their correct\nglobal shutter (GS) frame. However, the cause of the RS effect is inherently\ntemporal, not spatial. In this paper we propose a space-time solution to the RS\nproblem. We observe that despite the severe differences between their xy\nframes, a RS video and its corresponding GS video tend to share the exact same\nxt slices -- up to a known sub-frame temporal shift. Moreover, they share the\nsame distribution of small 2D xt-patches, despite the strong temporal aliasing\nwithin each video. This allows to constrain the GS output video using\nvideo-specific constraints imposed by the RS input video. Our algorithm is\ncomposed of 3 main components: (i) Dense temporal upsampling between\nconsecutive RS frames using an off-the-shelf method, (which was trained on\nregular video sequences), from which we extract GS \"proposals\". (ii) Learning\nto correctly merge an ensemble of such GS \"proposals\" using a dedicated\nMergeNet. (iii) A video-specific zero-shot optimization which imposes the\nsimilarity of xt-patches between the GS output video and the RS input video.\nOur method obtains state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets, both\nnumerically and visually, despite being trained on a small synthetic RS/GS\ndataset. Moreover, it generalizes well to new complex RS videos with motion\ntypes outside the distribution of the training set (e.g., complex non-rigid\nmotions) -- videos which competing methods trained on much more data cannot\nhandle well. We attribute these generalization capabilities to the combination\nof external and internal constraints.",

It has been shown to be NP-hard; so it must be solve by efficient\nheuristic algorithms such as the block improvement method (BIM). This paper\nfocuses on the maximization of bi-quadratic forms, which leads to a rank-one\napproximation problem that is equivalent to computing the M-spectral radius and\nits corresponding eigenvectors. Specifically, we provide a tight upper bound of\nthe M-spectral radius for nonnegative fourth-order partially symmetric (PS)\ntensors, which can be considered as an approximation of the M-spectral radius.\nFurthermore, we showed that the proposed upper bound can be obtained more\nefficiently, if the nonnegative fourth-order PS-tensors is a member of certain\nmonoid semigroups. Furthermore, as an extension of the proposed upper bound, we\nderive the exact solutions of the M-spectral radius and its corresponding\nM-eigenvectors for certain classes of fourth-order PS-tensors. Lastly, as an\napplication of the proposed bound, we obtain a practically testable sufficient\ncondition for nonsingular elasticity M-tensors with strong ellipticity\ncondition.\nWe conduct several numerical experiments to demonstrate the utility of the\nproposed results. The results show that: (a) our proposed method can attain a\ntight upper bound of the M-spectral radius with little computational burden,\nand (b) such tight and efficient upper bounds greatly enhance the convergence\nspeed of the BIM-algorithm, allowing it to be applicable for large-scale\nproblems in applications.",

    "title": "From Multi-label Learning to Cross-Domain Transfer: A Model-Agnostic  Approach",
    "abstract": "In multi-label learning, a particular case of multi-task learning where a\nsingle data point is associated with multiple target labels, it was widely\nassumed in the literature that, to obtain best accuracy, the dependence among\nthe labels should be explicitly modeled. This premise led to a proliferation of\nmethods offering techniques to learn and predict labels together, for example\nwhere the prediction for one label influences predictions for other labels.\nEven though it is now acknowledged that in many contexts a model of dependence\nis not required for optimal performance, such models continue to outperform\nindependent models in some of those very contexts, suggesting alternative\nexplanations for their performance beyond label dependence, which the\nliterature is only recently beginning to unravel. Leveraging and extending\nrecent discoveries, we turn the original premise of multi-label learning on its\nhead, and approach the problem of joint-modeling specifically under the absence\nof any measurable dependence among task labels; for example, when task labels\ncome from separate problem domains. We shift insights from this study towards\nbuilding an approach for transfer learning that challenges the long-held\nassumption that transferability of tasks comes from measurements of similarity\nbetween the source and target domains or models. This allows us to design and\ntest a method for transfer learning, which is model driven rather than purely\ndata driven, and furthermore it is black box and model-agnostic (any base model\nclass can be considered). We show that essentially we can create\ntask-dependence based on source-model capacity. The results we obtain have\nimportant implications and provide clear directions for future work, both in\nthe areas of multi-label and transfer learning.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new distributed consensus-based control method for\nvoltage and frequency control of fully inverter-based islanded microgrids\n(MGs). The proposed method includes the active power sharing in voltage control\nto improve the reactive power sharing accuracy and thus generalizes some\nexisting secondary frequency and voltage control methods. Firstly, frequency is\nregulated by distributed secondary frequency control. Secondly, voltage is\nregulated by distributed average voltage control and decentralized individual\nvoltage control. It offers a tunable trade-off between voltage regulation,\nactive, and reactive power sharing accuracy. Therefore, it avoids the abuse of\nsacrificing reactive power sharing accuracy for exact voltage regulation which\nis a common issue of existing methods. The proposed method is implemented in a\ndistributed way that does not require a prior knowledge of the MG network\nstructure and loads and hence can ensure scalability. Simulation results shows\nthat the proposed controller achieves different compromise between the above\nthree targets under different modes of operation.",

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a promising technique to enhance\nthe performance of physical-layer key generation (PKG) due to its ability to\nsmartly customize the radio environments. Existing RIS-assisted PKG methods are\nmainly based on the idealistic assumption of an independent and identically\ndistributed (i.i.d.) channel model at both the transmitter and the RIS.\nHowever, the i.i.d. model is inaccurate for a typical RIS in an isotropic\nscattering environment. Also, neglecting the existence of channel spatial\ncorrelation would degrade the PKG performance. In this paper, we establish a\ngeneral spatially correlated channel model in multi-antenna systems and propose\na new PKG framework based on the transmit and the reflective beamforming at the\nbase station (BS) and the RIS. Specifically, we derive a closed-form expression\nfor characterizing the key generation rate (KGR) and obtain a globally optimal\nsolution of the beamformers to maximize the KGR. Furthermore, we analyze the\nKGR performance difference between the one adopting the assumption of the\ni.i.d. model and that of the spatially correlated model. It is found that the\nbeamforming designed for the correlated model outperforms that for the i.i.d.\nmodel while the KGR gain increases with the channel correlation. Simulation\nresults show that compared to existing methods based on the i.i.d. fading\nmodel, our proposed method achieves about $5$ dB performance gain when the BS\nantenna correlation $\\rho$ is $0.3$ and the RIS element spacing is half of the\nwavelength.",

The 4G LTE air interface uses extra overhead to enable scheduled\naccess, which is not justified for small payload sizes. We employ a random\naccess communication model with retransmissions for multiple users with small\npayloads at the low spectral efficiency regime. The radio resources are split\nnon-orthogonally in the time and frequency dimensions. Retransmissions are\ncombined via Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) methods, namely Chase\nCombining and Incremental Redundancy with a finite buffer size constraint\n$C_{\\sf buf}$. We determine the best scaling for the spectral efficiency (SE)\nversus signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per bit and for the user density versus SNR\nper bit, for the sum-optimal regime and when the interference is treated as\nnoise, using a Shannon capacity approximation. Numerical results show that the\nscaling results are applicable over a range of $\\eta$, $T$, $C_{\\sf buf}$, $J$,\nat low received SNR values. The proposed analytical framework provides insights\nfor resource allocation in general random access systems and specific 5G use\ncases for massive URLLC uplink access.",

    "abstract": "Data drift is a thorny challenge when deploying person re-identification\n(ReID) models into real-world devices, where the data distribution is\nsignificantly different from that of the training environment and keeps\nchanging. To tackle this issue, we propose a federated spatial-temporal\nincremental learning approach, named FedSTIL, which leverages both lifelong\nlearning and federated learning to continuously optimize models deployed on\nmany distributed edge clients. Unlike previous efforts, FedSTIL aims to mine\nspatial-temporal correlations among the knowledge learnt from different edge\nclients. Specifically, the edge clients first periodically extract general\nrepresentations of drifted data to optimize their local models. Then, the\nlearnt knowledge from edge clients will be aggregated by centralized parameter\nserver, where the knowledge will be selectively and attentively distilled from\nspatial- and temporal-dimension with carefully designed mechanisms. Finally,\nthe distilled informative spatial-temporal knowledge will be sent back to\ncorrelated edge clients to further improve the recognition accuracy of each\nedge client with a lifelong learning method. Extensive experiments on a mixture\nof five real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms others by\nnearly 4% in Rank-1 accuracy, while reducing communication cost by 62%.

Its favorable performance and wise action decisions\nrely on an accurate estimation of action values. The overestimation problem is\na widely known issue of RL since its estimate of the maximum action value is\nlarger than the ground truth, which results in an unstable learning process and\nsuboptimal policy. This problem is detrimental to RL-based dialogue policy\nlearning. To mitigate this problem, this paper proposes a dynamic partial\naverage estimator (DPAV) of the ground truth maximum action value. DPAV\ncalculates the partial average between the predicted maximum action value and\nminimum action value, where the weights are dynamically adaptive and\nproblem-dependent. We incorporate DPAV into a deep Q-network as the dialogue\npolicy and show that our method can achieve better or comparable results\ncompared to top baselines on three dialogue datasets of different domains with\na lower computational load.

These mistakes, which can be both syntactic and\nsemantic, are hard for low-code users to identify and fix, even though they can\nbe resolved with just a few edits. We formalize the problem of producing such\nedits as the last-mile repair problem. To address this problem, we developed\nLaMirage, a LAst-MIle RepAir-engine GEnerator that combines symbolic and neural\ntechniques to perform last-mile repair in low-code formula languages. LaMirage\ntakes a grammar and a set of domain-specific constraints/rules, which jointly\napproximate the target language, and uses these to generate a repair engine\nthat can fix formulas in that language. To tackle the challenges of localizing\nthe errors and ranking the candidate repairs, LaMirage leverages neural\ntechniques, whereas it relies on symbolic methods to generate candidate\nrepairs. This combination allows LaMirage to find repairs that satisfy the\nprovided grammar and constraints, and then pick the most natural repair.

The\ndetection of a shift from the training distribution of individual datapoints\nhas gained attention. A number of techniques have been proposed for such\nout-of-distribution (OOD) detection. But in many applications, the inputs to a\nmachine learning model form a temporal sequence.

    "abstract": "Talking head synthesis is an emerging technology with wide applications in\nfilm dubbing, virtual avatars and online education. Recent NeRF-based methods\ngenerate more natural talking videos, as they better capture the 3D structural\ninformation of faces. However, a specific model needs to be trained for each\nidentity with a large dataset. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Facial\nRadiance Fields (DFRF) for few-shot talking head synthesis, which can rapidly\ngeneralize to an unseen identity with few training data. Different from the\nexisting NeRF-based methods which directly encode the 3D geometry and\nappearance of a specific person into the network, our DFRF conditions face\nradiance field on 2D appearance images to learn the face prior. Thus the facial\nradiance field can be flexibly adjusted to the new identity with few reference\nimages. Additionally, for better modeling of the facial deformations, we\npropose a differentiable face warping module conditioned on audio signals to\ndeform all reference images to the query space. Extensive experiments show that\nwith only tens of seconds of training clip available, our proposed DFRF can\nsynthesize natural and high-quality audio-driven talking head videos for novel\nidentities with only 40k iterations.

    "abstract": "A robot's ability to complete a task is heavily dependent on its physical\ndesign. However, identifying an optimal physical design and its corresponding\ncontrol policy is inherently challenging. The freedom to choose the number of\nlinks, their type, and how they are connected results in a combinatorial design\nspace, and the evaluation of any design in that space requires deriving its\noptimal controller. In this work, we present N-LIMB, an efficient approach to\noptimizing the design and control of a robot over large sets of morphologies.\nCentral to our framework is a universal, design-conditioned control policy\ncapable of controlling a diverse sets of designs. This policy greatly improves\nthe sample efficiency of our approach by allowing the transfer of experience\nacross designs and reducing the cost to evaluate new designs. We train this\npolicy to maximize expected return over a distribution of designs, which is\nsimultaneously updated towards higher performing designs under the universal\npolicy. In this way, our approach converges towards a design distribution\npeaked around high-performing designs and a controller that is effectively\nfine-tuned for those designs. We demonstrate the potential of our approach on a\nseries of locomotion tasks across varying terrains and show the discovery novel\nand high-performing design-control pairs.",

    "abstract": "Microservices Architecture (MSA) has become a de-facto standard for designing\ncloud-native enterprise applications due to its efficient infrastructure setup,\nservice availability, elastic scalability, dependability, and better security.\nExisting (monolithic) systems must be decomposed into microservices to harness\nthese characteristics. Since manual decomposition of large scale applications\ncan be laborious and error-prone, AI-based systems to detect decomposition\nstrategies are gaining popularity. However, the usefulness of these approaches\nis limited by the expressiveness of the program representation and their\ninability to model the application's dependency on critical external resources\nsuch as databases. Consequently, partitioning recommendations offered by\ncurrent tools result in architectures that result in (a) distributed monoliths,\nand/or (b) force the use of (often criticized) distributed transactions. This\nwork attempts to overcome these challenges by introducing CARGO({short for\n[C]ontext-sensitive l[A]bel p[R]opa[G]ati[O]n})-a novel un-/semi-supervised\npartition refinement technique that uses a context- and flow-sensitive system\ndependency graph of the monolithic application to refine and thereby enrich the\npartitioning quality of the current state-of-the-art algorithms. CARGO was used\nto augment four state-of-the-art microservice partitioning techniques that were\napplied on five Java EE applications (including one industrial scale\nproprietary project). Experiments demostrate that CARGO can improve the\npartition quality of all modern microservice partitioning techniques. Further,\nCARGO substantially reduces distributed transactions and a real-world\nperformance evaluation of a benchmark application (deployed under varying\nloads) shows that CARGO also lowers the overall the latency of the deployed\nmicroservice application by 11% and increases throughput by 120% on average.",

    "abstract": "Unbiased Learning to Rank~(ULTR) that learns to rank documents with biased\nuser feedback data is a well-known challenge in information retrieval. Existing\nmethods in unbiased learning to rank typically rely on click modeling or\ninverse propensity weighting~(IPW). Unfortunately, the search engines are faced\nwith severe long-tail query distribution, where neither click modeling nor IPW\ncan handle well. Click modeling suffers from data sparsity problem since the\nsame query-document pair appears limited times on tail queries; IPW suffers\nfrom high variance problem since it is highly sensitive to small propensity\nscore values. Therefore, a general debiasing framework that works well under\ntail queries is in desperate need. To address this problem, we propose a\nmodel-based unbiased learning-to-rank framework. Specifically, we develop a\ngeneral context-aware user simulator to generate pseudo clicks for unobserved\nranked lists to train rankers, which addresses the data sparsity problem. In\naddition, considering the discrepancy between pseudo clicks and actual clicks,\nwe take the observation of a ranked list as the treatment variable and further\nincorporate inverse propensity weighting with pseudo labels in a doubly robust\nway. The derived bias and variance indicate that the proposed model-based\nmethod is more robust than existing methods. Finally, extensive experiments on\nbenchmark datasets, including simulated datasets and real click logs,\ndemonstrate that the proposed model-based method consistently performs\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods in various scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Vertical federated learning is considered, where an active party, having\naccess to true class labels, wishes to build a classification model by\nutilizing more features from a passive party, which has no access to the\nlabels, to improve the model accuracy. In the prediction phase, with logistic\nregression as the classification model, several inference attack techniques are\nproposed that the adversary, i.e., the active party, can employ to reconstruct\nthe passive party's features, regarded as sensitive information. These attacks,\nwhich are mainly based on a classical notion of the center of a set, i.e., the\nChebyshev center, are shown to be superior to those proposed in the literature.\nMoreover, several theoretical performance guarantees are provided for the\naforementioned attacks. Subsequently, we consider the minimum amount of\ninformation that the adversary needs to fully reconstruct the passive party's\nfeatures. In particular, it is shown that when the passive party holds one\nfeature, and the adversary is only aware of the signs of the parameters\ninvolved, it can perfectly reconstruct that feature when the number of\npredictions is large enough. Next, as a defense mechanism, two\nprivacy-preserving schemes are proposed that worsen the adversary's\nreconstruction attacks, while preserving the full benefits that VFL brings to\nthe active party.

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection aims at identifying deviant samples from the normal data\ndistribution. Contrastive learning has provided a successful way to sample\nrepresentation that enables effective discrimination on anomalies. However,\nwhen contaminated with unlabeled abnormal samples in training set under\nsemi-supervised settings, current contrastive-based methods generally 1) ignore\nthe comprehensive relation between training data, leading to suboptimal\nperformance, and 2) require fine-tuning, resulting in low efficiency. To\naddress the above two issues, in this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical\nsemi-supervised contrastive learning (HSCL) framework, for\ncontamination-resistant anomaly detection. Specifically, HSCL hierarchically\nregulates three complementary relations: sample-to-sample, sample-to-prototype,\nand normal-to-abnormal relations, enlarging the discrimination between normal\nand abnormal samples with a comprehensive exploration of the contaminated data.\nBesides, HSCL is an end-to-end learning approach that can efficiently learn\ndiscriminative representations without fine-tuning. HSCL achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in multiple scenarios, such as one-class\nclassification and cross-dataset detection.

This enables us to preserve the style of local\ngeometric features, even if it drastically differs from the training data. Our\nfully automatic approach proceeds in two stages.

Along with the dataset, we have provided several\nbaseline models for emotion classification focusing on the state-of-the-art\ntransformer-based language models. Our best model achieves a macro-averaged F1\nscore of 75.39 percent across our test dataset. Moreover, we also conduct\ntransfer learning experiments to compare our proposed dataset's generalization\nagainst other Persian emotion datasets. Results of these experiments suggest\nthat our dataset has superior generalizability among the existing Persian\nemotion datasets. ArmanEmo is publicly available for non-commercial use at\nhttps://github.com/Arman-Rayan-Sharif/arman-text-emotion.",

It includes nearly 10,000 segmentations of 100 categories in over\n4,500 images that were taken by people with visual impairments. Compared to\nexisting few-shot object detection and instance segmentation datasets, our\ndataset is the first to locate holes in objects (e.g., found in 12.3\\% of our\nsegmentations), it shows objects that occupy a much larger range of sizes\nrelative to the images, and text is over five times more common in our objects\n(e.g., found in 22.4\\% of our segmentations). Analysis of three modern few-shot\nlocalization algorithms demonstrates that they generalize poorly to our new\ndataset. The algorithms commonly struggle to locate objects with holes, very\nsmall and very large objects, and objects lacking text.

Most of the graph machine learning models, such as Graph\nNeural Networks (GNNs), are trained over massive graph data.

Federated Graph Machine Learning (FGML) is a promising solution\nto tackle this challenge by training graph machine learning models in a\nfederated manner. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review of the\nliterature in FGML. Specifically, we first provide a new taxonomy to divide the\nexisting problems in FGML into two settings, namely, \\emph{FL with structured\ndata} and \\emph{structured FL}. Then, we review the mainstream techniques in\neach setting and elaborate on how they address the challenges under FGML.

Each RAN slice is constituted by various virtual network\nfunctions (VNFs) distributed geographically in numerous substrate nodes. A key\nchallenge in building a robust RAN slicing is, therefore, designing a RAN\nslicing (RS)-configuration scheme that can utilize information such as resource\navailability in substrate networks as well as the interdependent relationships\namong slices to map (embed) VNFs onto live substrate nodes. With such\nmotivation, we propose a machine-learning-powered RAN slicing scheme that aims\nto accommodate maximum numbers of slices (a set of connected Virtual Network\nFunctions - VNFs) within a given request set. More specifically, we present a\ndeep reinforcement scheme that is called Deep Allocation Agent (DAA). In short,\nDAA utilizes an empirically designed deep neural network that observes the\ncurrent states of the substrate network and the requested slices to schedule\nthe slices of which VNFs are then mapped to substrate nodes using an\noptimization algorithm. DAA is trained towards the goal of maximizing the\nnumber of accommodated slices in the given set by using an explicitly designed\nreward function.

For a wireless device to transmit successfully, it uses a\nbackoff protocol to ensure exclusive access to the channel. Modern radios,\nhowever, do not need exclusive access to the channel to communicate; in\nparticular, they have the ability to receive useful information even when more\nthan one device transmits at the same time. These capabilities have now been\nexploited for many years by systems that rely on interference cancellation,\nphysical layer network coding and analog network coding to improve efficiency.\nFor example, Zigzag decoding [56] demonstrated how a base station can decode\nmessages sent by multiple devices simultaneously.\nIn this paper, we address the following question: Can we design a backoff\nprotocol that is better than exponential backoff when exclusive channel access\nis not required. We define the Coded Radio Network Model, which generalizes\ntraditional radio network models (e.g., [30]). We then introduce the Decodable\nBackoff Algorithm, a randomized backoff protocol that achieves an optimal\nthroughput of $1-o(1)$.

We prove two new\nlower bounds in the area of additive spanners:\n1) We construct $n$-node graphs $G$ for which any spanner on $O(n)$ edges\nmust increase a pairwise distance by $+\\Omega(n^{1/7})$. This improves on a\nrecent lower bound of $+\\Omega(n^{1/10.5})$ by Lu, Wein, Vassilevska Williams,\nand Xu [SODA '22].\n2) A classic result by Coppersmith and Elkin [SODA '05] proves that for any\n$n$-node graph $G$ and set of $p = O(n^{1/2})$ demand pairs, one can exactly\npreserve all pairwise distances among demand pairs using a spanner on $O(n)$\nedges. They also provided a lower bound construction, establishing that that\nthis range $p = O(n^{1/2})$ cannot be improved. We strengthen this lower bound\nby proving that, for any constant $k$, this range of $p$ is still unimprovable\neven if the spanner is allowed $+k$ additive error among the demand pairs. This\nnegatively resolves an open question asked by Coppersmith and Elkin [SODA '05]\nand again by Cygan, Grandoni, and Kavitha [STACS '13] and Abboud and Bodwin\n[SODA '16].\nAt a technical level, our lower bounds are obtained by an improvement to the\nentire obstacle product framework used to compose ``inner'' and ``outer''\ngraphs into lower bound instances. In particular, we develop a new strategy for\nanalysis that allows certain non-layered graphs to be used in the product, and\nwe use this freedom to design better inner and outer graphs that lead to our\nnew lower bounds.",

The efficiency of\nthe $\\textit{FastSVD-ML-ROM}$ framework is demonstrated for a 2D linear\nconvection-diffusion equation, the problem of fluid around a cylinder, and the\n3D blood flow inside an arterial segment. The accuracy of the reconstructed\nresults demonstrates the robustness and assesses the efficiency of the proposed\napproach.",

These matrices occur as temporal\nparts of Galerkin finite element discretizations of parabolic or hyperbolic\nproblems when the modified Hilbert transformation is used for the variational\nsetting. This work provides the calculation of these matrices to machine\nprecision for arbitrary polynomial degrees and non-uniform meshes. The proposed\nquadrature schemes are based on weakly singular integral representations of the\nmodified Hilbert transformation. First, these weakly singular integral\nrepresentations of the modified Hilbert transformation are proven. Second,\nusing these integral representations, we derive quadrature schemes, which treat\nthe occurring singularities appropriately. Thus, exponential convergence with\nrespect to the number of quadrature nodes for the proposed quadrature schemes\nis achieved.

    "abstract": "Normalizing flow models have been used successfully for generative image\nsuper-resolution (SR) by approximating complex distribution of natural images\nto simple tractable distribution in latent space through Invertible Neural\nNetworks (INN). These models can generate multiple realistic SR images from one\nlow-resolution (LR) input using randomly sampled points in the latent space,\nsimulating the ill-posed nature of image upscaling where multiple\nhigh-resolution (HR) images correspond to the same LR. Lately, the invertible\nprocess in INN has also been used successfully by bidirectional image rescaling\nmodels like IRN and HCFlow for joint optimization of downscaling and inverse\nupscaling, resulting in significant improvements in upscaled image quality.\nWhile they are optimized for image downscaling too, the ill-posed nature of\nimage downscaling, where one HR image could be downsized to multiple LR images\ndepending on different interpolation kernels and resampling methods, is not\nconsidered. A new downscaling latent variable, in addition to the original one\nrepresenting uncertainties in image upscaling, is introduced to model\nvariations in the image downscaling process. This dual latent variable\nenhancement is applicable to different image rescaling models and it is shown\nin extensive experiments that it can improve image upscaling accuracy\nconsistently without sacrificing image quality in downscaled LR images. It is\nalso shown to be effective in enhancing other INN-based models for image\nrestoration applications like image hiding.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have recently pointed that existing Visual Question Answering\n(VQA) models heavily suffer from the language prior problem, which refers to\ncapturing superficial statistical correlations between the question type and\nthe answer whereas ignoring the image contents. Numerous efforts have been\ndedicated to strengthen the image dependency by creating the delicate models or\nintroducing the extra visual annotations. However, these methods cannot\nsufficiently explore how the visual cues explicitly affect the learned answer\nrepresentation, which is vital for language reliance alleviation. Moreover,\nthey generally emphasize the class-level discrimination of the learned answer\nrepresentation, which overlooks the more fine-grained instance-level patterns\nand demands further optimization. In this paper, we propose a novel\ncollaborative learning scheme from the viewpoint of visual perturbation\ncalibration, which can better investigate the fine-grained visual effects and\nmitigate the language prior problem by learning the instance-level\ncharacteristics. Specifically, we devise a visual controller to construct two\nsorts of curated images with different perturbation extents, based on which the\ncollaborative learning of intra-instance invariance and inter-instance\ndiscrimination is implemented by two well-designed discriminators. Besides, we\nimplement the information bottleneck modulator on latent space for further bias\nalleviation and representation calibration. We impose our visual\nperturbation-aware framework to three orthodox baselines and the experimental\nresults on two diagnostic VQA-CP benchmark datasets evidently demonstrate its\neffectiveness.

SQP uses frame-coupled, paced packet trains to\nsample the network bandwidth, and uses an adaptive one-way delay measurement to\nrecover from queuing, for low, bounded queuing delay. SQP rapidly adapts to\nchanges in the link bandwidth, ensuring high utilization and low frame delay,\nand also achieves competitive bandwidth shares when competing with\nqueue-building flows within an acceptable delay envelope. SQP has good fairness\nproperties, and works well on links with shallow buffers.\nIn real-world A/B testing of SQP against Copa in Google's AR streaming\nplatform, SQP achieves 27% and 15% more sessions with high bitrate and low\nframe delay for LTE and Wi-Fi, respectively. When competing with queue-building\ntraffic like Cubic and BBR, SQP achieves 2-3X higher bandwidth compared to\nGoogCC (WebRTC), Sprout, and PCC-Vivace, and comparable performance to Copa\n(with mode switching).",

To tackle these problems, we propose a\nTransformer for Panoramic Semantic Segmentation (Trans4PASS) architecture.\nFirst, to enhance distortion awareness, Trans4PASS, equipped with Deformable\nPatch Embedding (DPE) and Deformable MLP (DMLP) modules, is capable of handling\nobject deformations and image distortions whenever (before or after adaptation)\nand wherever (shallow or deep levels) by design.

Previous work has\ntreated contradiction detection in bot responses as a task similar to natural\nlanguage inference, e.g., detect the contradiction between a pair of bot\nutterances. However, utterances in conversations may contain co-references or\nellipsis, and using these utterances as is may not always be sufficient for\nidentifying contradictions.

We empirically demonstrate that this model can produce satisfactory\nrewrites to make bot utterances more complete.

    "abstract": "FHE offers protection to private data on third-party cloud servers by\nallowing computations on the data in encrypted form. However, to support\ngeneral-purpose encrypted computations, all existing FHE schemes require an\nexpensive operation known as bootstrapping. Unfortunately, the computation cost\nand the memory bandwidth required for bootstrapping add significant overhead to\nFHE-based computations, limiting the practical use of FHE. In this work, we\npropose FAB, an FPGA-based accelerator for bootstrappable FHE. Prior FPGA-based\nFHE accelerators have proposed hardware acceleration of basic FHE primitives\nfor impractical parameter sets without support for bootstrapping. FAB, for the\nfirst time ever, accelerates bootstrapping (along with basic FHE primitives) on\nan FPGA for a secure and practical parameter set. The key contribution of our\nwork is to architect a balanced FAB design, which is not memory bound. To this\nend, we leverage recent algorithms for bootstrapping while being cognizant of\nthe compute and memory constraints of our FPGA. We use a minimal number of\nfunctional units for computing, operate at a low frequency, leverage high data\nrates to and from main memory, utilize the limited on-chip memory effectively,\nand perform operation scheduling carefully. For bootstrapping a fully-packed\nciphertext, while operating at 300 MHz, FAB outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art CPU and GPU implementations by 213x and 1.5x respectively. Our\ntarget FHE application is training a logistic regression model over encrypted\ndata. For logistic regression model training scaled to 8 FPGAs on the cloud,\nFAB outperforms a CPU and GPU by 456x and 6.5x and provides competitive\nperformance when compared to the state-of-the-art ASIC design at a fraction of\nthe cost.",

Rather than a single label classification task, it is more rational\nto regard VEA as a Label Distribution Learning (LDL) problem by voting from\ndifferent individuals. Existing methods often predict visual emotion\ndistribution in a unified network, neglecting the inherent subjectivity in its\ncrowd voting process. In psychology, the \\textit{Object-Appraisal-Emotion}\nmodel has demonstrated that each individual's emotion is affected by his/her\nsubjective appraisal, which is further formed by the affective memory. Inspired\nby this, we propose a novel \\textit{Subjectivity Appraise-and-Match Network\n(SAMNet)} to investigate the subjectivity in visual emotion distribution. To\ndepict the diversity in crowd voting process, we first propose the\n\\textit{Subjectivity Appraising} with multiple branches, where each branch\nsimulates the emotion evocation process of a specific individual. Specifically,\nwe construct the affective memory with an attention-based mechanism to preserve\neach individual's unique emotional experience. A subjectivity loss is further\nproposed to guarantee the divergence between different individuals. Moreover,\nwe propose the \\textit{Subjectivity Matching} with a matching loss, aiming at\nassigning unordered emotion labels to ordered individual predictions in a\none-to-one correspondence with the Hungarian algorithm.

    "abstract": "In recent years, Cross-Modal Hashing (CMH) has aroused much attention due to\nits fast query speed and efficient storage. Previous literatures have achieved\npromising results for Cross-Modal Retrieval (CMR) by discovering discriminative\nhash codes and modality-specific hash functions. Nonetheless, most existing CMR\nworks are subjected to some restrictions: 1) It is assumed that data of\ndifferent modalities are fully paired, which is impractical in real\napplications due to sample missing and false data alignment, and 2) binary\nregression targets including the label matrix and binary codes are too rigid to\neffectively learn semantic-preserving hash codes and hash functions. To address\nthese problems, this paper proposes an Adaptive Marginalized Semantic Hashing\n(AMSH) method which not only enhances the discrimination of latent\nrepresentations and hash codes by adaptive margins, but also can be used for\nboth paired and unpaired CMR. As a two-step method, in the first step, AMSH\ngenerates semantic-aware modality-specific latent representations with\nadaptively marginalized labels, which enlarges the distances between different\nclasses, and exploits the labels to preserve the inter-modal and intra-modal\nsemantic similarities into latent representations and hash codes. In the second\nstep, adaptive margin matrices are embedded into the hash codes, and enlarge\nthe gaps between positive and negative bits, which improves the discrimination\nand robustness of hash functions. On this basis, AMSH generates\nsimilarity-preserving hash codes and robust hash functions without strict\none-to-one data correspondence requirement. Experiments are conducted on\nseveral benchmark datasets to demonstrate the superiority and flexibility of\nAMSH over some state-of-the-art CMR methods.",

Concretely, our HIRE framework initially performs\nfirst-order node-level knowledge distillation, which encodes the semantics of\nthe teacher HGNN with its prediction logits. Meanwhile, the second-order\nrelation-level knowledge distillation imitates the relational correlation\nbetween node embeddings of different types generated by the teacher HGNN.\nExtensive experiments on various popular HGNNs models and three real-world\nheterogeneous graphs demonstrate that our method obtains consistent and\nconsiderable performance enhancement, proving its effectiveness and\ngeneralization ability.",

    "abstract": "With the availability of commercial Light Field (LF) cameras, LF imaging has\nemerged as an up and coming technology in computational photography. However,\nthe spatial resolution is significantly constrained in commercial microlens\nbased LF cameras because of the inherent multiplexing of spatial and angular\ninformation. Therefore, it becomes the main bottleneck for other applications\nof light field cameras. This paper proposes an adaptation module in a\npretrained Single Image Super Resolution (SISR) network to leverage the\npowerful SISR model instead of using highly engineered light field imaging\ndomain specific Super Resolution models. The adaption module consists of a Sub\naperture Shift block and a fusion block. It is an adaptation in the SISR\nnetwork to further exploit the spatial and angular information in LF images to\nimprove the super resolution performance. Experimental validation shows that\nthe proposed method outperforms existing light field super resolution\nalgorithms. It also achieves PSNR gains of more than 1 dB across all the\ndatasets as compared to the same pretrained SISR models for scale factor 2, and\nPSNR gains 0.6 to 1 dB for scale factor 4.",

    "abstract": "Face clustering is a promising way to scale up face recognition systems using\nlarge-scale unlabeled face images. It remains challenging to identify small or\nsparse face image clusters that we call hard clusters, which is caused by the\nheterogeneity, \\ie, high variations in size and sparsity, of the clusters.\nConsequently, the conventional way of using a uniform threshold (to identify\nclusters) often leads to a terrible misclassification for the samples that\nshould belong to hard clusters. We tackle this problem by leveraging the\nneighborhood information of samples and inferring the cluster memberships (of\nsamples) in a probabilistic way. We introduce two novel modules,\nNeighborhood-Diffusion-based Density (NDDe) and Transition-Probability-based\nDistance (TPDi), based on which we can simply apply the standard Density Peak\nClustering algorithm with a uniform threshold. Our experiments on multiple\nbenchmarks show that each module contributes to the final performance of our\nmethod, and by incorporating them into other advanced face clustering methods,\nthese two modules can boost the performance of these methods to a new\nstate-of-the-art.

Two major challenges arises under this new setting:\none is how to simultaneously solve the domain misalignment issue for both\ndetection and Re-ID tasks, and the other is how to train the ReID subtask\nwithout reliable detection results on the target domain. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a strong baseline framework with two dedicated designs.\n1) We design a domain alignment module including image-level and task-sensitive\ninstance-level alignments, to minimize the domain discrepancy. 2) We take full\nadvantage of the unlabeled data with a dynamic clustering strategy, and employ\npseudo bounding boxes to support ReID and detection training on the target\ndomain. With the above designs, our framework achieves 34.7% in mAP and 80.6%\nin top-1 on PRW dataset, surpassing the direct transferring baseline by a large\nmargin.

Binary\ndata is ubiquitous in many fields, and representing data by binary matrices is\ncommon in medicine, natural language processing, bioinformatics, computer\ngraphics, among many others. Unfortunately, BMF is computationally hard and\nheuristic algorithms are used to compute Boolean factorizations. Very recently,\nthe theoretical breakthrough was obtained independently by two research groups.\nBan et al. (SODA 2019) and Fomin et al. (Trans.

However,\ndespite the theoretical importance, the high double-exponential dependence of\nthe running times from the rank makes these algorithms unimplementable in\npractice. The primary research question motivating our work is whether the\ntheoretical advances on BMF could lead to practical algorithms.\nThe main conceptional contribution of our work is the following. While EPTAS\nfor BMF is a purely theoretical advance, the general approach behind these\nalgorithms could serve as the basis in designing better heuristics.

Training GNN-based\nrecommender systems (GNNRecSys) on large graphs incurs a large memory\nfootprint, easily exceeding the DRAM capacity on a typical server. Existing\nsolutions resort to distributed subgraph training, which is inefficient due to\nthe high cost of dynamically constructing subgraphs and significant redundancy\nacross subgraphs.\nThe emerging Intel Optane persistent memory allows a single machine to have\nup to 6 TB of memory at an affordable cost, thus making single-machine\nGNNRecSys training feasible, which eliminates the inefficiencies in distributed\ntraining. One major concern of using Optane for GNNRecSys is Optane's\nrelatively low bandwidth compared with DRAMs. This limitation can be\nparticularly detrimental to achieving high performance for GNNRecSys workloads\nsince their dominant compute kernels are sparse and memory access intensive. To\nunderstand whether Optane is a good fit for GNNRecSys training, we perform an\nin-depth characterization of GNNRecSys workloads and a comprehensive\nbenchmarking study.

    "abstract": "In the field of 3D perception using 3D LiDAR sensors, ground segmentation is\nan essential task for various purposes, such as traversable area detection and\nobject recognition. Under these circumstances, several ground segmentation\nmethods have been proposed. However, some limitations are still encountered.\nFirst, some ground segmentation methods require fine-tuning of parameters\ndepending on the surroundings, which is excessively laborious and\ntime-consuming. Moreover, even if the parameters are well adjusted, a partial\nunder-segmentation problem can still emerge, which implies ground segmentation\nfailures in some regions. Finally, ground segmentation methods typically fail\nto estimate an appropriate ground plane when the ground is above another\nstructure, such as a retaining wall. To address these problems, we propose a\nrobust ground segmentation method called Patchwork++, an extension of\nPatchwork. Patchwork++ exploits adaptive ground likelihood estimation (A-GLE)\nto calculate appropriate parameters adaptively based on the previous ground\nsegmentation results. Moreover, temporal ground revert (TGR) alleviates a\npartial under-segmentation problem by using the temporary ground property.\nAlso, region-wise vertical plane fitting (R-VPF) is introduced to segment the\nground plane properly even if the ground is elevated with different layers.\nFinally, we present reflected noise removal (RNR) to eliminate virtual noise\npoints efficiently based on the 3D LiDAR reflection model.

On this basis, we\napply the fully connected time delayer phase shifter hybrid beamforming\narchitecture at the BS and deploy distributed RISs to cooperatively mitigate\nthe beam split effect. We aim to maximize the achievable sum rate by jointly\noptimizing the hybrid analog/digital beamforming, time delays at the BS and\nreflection coefficients at the RISs. To solve the formulated problem, we first\ndesign the analog beamforming and time delays based on different RISs physical\ndirections, and then it is transformed into an optimization problem by jointly\noptimizing the digital beamforming and reflection coefficients. Next, we\npropose an alternatively iterative optimization algorithm to deal with it.\nSpecifically, for given the reflection coefficients, we propose an iterative\nalgorithm based on the minimum mean square error technique to obtain the\ndigital beamforming.

    "abstract": "Individual abnormal behaviors vary depending on crowd sizes, contexts, and\nscenes. Challenges such as partial occlusions, blurring, large-number abnormal\nbehavior, and camera viewing occur in large-scale crowds when detecting,\ntracking, and recognizing individuals with abnormal behaviors. In this paper,\nour contribution is twofold. First, we introduce an annotated and labeled\nlarge-scale crowd abnormal behaviors Hajj dataset (HAJJv2). Second, we propose\ntwo methods of hybrid Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Random Forests\n(RFs) to detect and recognize Spatio-temporal abnormal behaviors in small and\nlarge-scales crowd videos. In small-scale crowd videos, a ResNet-50 pre-trained\nCNN model is fine-tuned to verify whether every frame is normal or abnormal in\nthe spatial domain. If anomalous behaviors are observed, a motion-based\nindividuals detection method based on the magnitudes and orientations of\nHorn-Schunck optical flow is used to locate and track individuals with abnormal\nbehaviors. A Kalman filter is employed in large-scale crowd videos to predict\nand track the detected individuals in the subsequent frames. Then, means,\nvariances, and standard deviations statistical features are computed and fed to\nthe RF to classify individuals with abnormal behaviors in the temporal domain.\nIn large-scale crowds, we fine-tune the ResNet-50 model using YOLOv2 object\ndetection technique to detect individuals with abnormal behaviors in the\nspatial domain.",

    "abstract": "Text detection and recognition are essential components of a modern OCR\nsystem. Most OCR approaches attempt to obtain accurate bounding boxes of text\nat the detection stage, which is used as the input of the text recognition\nstage. We observe that when using tight text bounding boxes as input, a text\nrecognizer frequently fails to achieve optimal performance due to the\ninconsistency between bounding boxes and deep representations of text\nrecognition. In this paper, we propose Box Adjuster, a reinforcement\nlearning-based method for adjusting the shape of each text bounding box to make\nit more compatible with text recognition models. Additionally, when dealing\nwith cross-domain problems such as synthetic-to-real, the proposed method\nsignificantly reduces mismatches in domain distribution between the source and\ntarget domains. Experiments demonstrate that the performance of end-to-end text\nrecognition systems can be improved when using the adjusted bounding boxes as\nthe ground truths for training. Specifically, on several benchmark datasets for\nscene text understanding, the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art text\nspotters by an average of 2.0% F-Score on end-to-end text recognition tasks and\n4.6% F-Score on domain adaptation tasks.",

Recently,\nRefSR has been attracting great attention as it provides an alternative way to\nsurpass single image SR. However, addressing the RefSR problem has two critical\nchallenges: (i) It is difficult to match the correspondence between LR and Ref\nimages when they are significantly different; (ii) How to transfer the relevant\ntexture from Ref images to compensate the details for LR images is very\nchallenging. To address these issues of RefSR, this paper proposes a deformable\nattention Transformer, namely DATSR, with multiple scales, each of which\nconsists of a texture feature encoder (TFE) module, a reference-based\ndeformable attention (RDA) module and a residual feature aggregation (RFA)\nmodule. Specifically, TFE first extracts image transformation (e.g.,\nbrightness) insensitive features for LR and Ref images, RDA then can exploit\nmultiple relevant textures to compensate more information for LR features, and\nRFA lastly aggregates LR features and relevant textures to get a more visually\npleasant result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DATSR achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets quantitatively and\nqualitatively.",

To address these, we\npresent a generic framework called GE-Grasp for robotic motion planning in\ndense clutter, where we leverage diverse action primitives for occluded object\nremoval and present the generator-evaluator architecture to avoid spatial\ncollisions. Therefore, our GE-Grasp is capable of grasping objects in dense\nclutter efficiently with promising success rates. Specifically, we define three\naction primitives: target-oriented grasping for target capturing, pushing, and\nnontarget-oriented grasping to reduce the crowdedness and occlusions. The\ngenerators effectively provide various action candidates referring to the\nspatial information. Meanwhile, the evaluators assess the selected action\nprimitive candidates, where the optimal action is implemented by the robot.\nExtensive experiments in simulated and real-world environments show that our\napproach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods of grasping in clutter with\nrespect to motion efficiency and success rates.

This paper introduces an\nimprovement to the SCL decoding for polar and pre-transformed polar codes that\nreduces the number of sorting operations without degrading the code's\nerror-correction performance. In an SCL decoding with an optimum metric\nfunction we show that, on average, the correct branch's bit-metric value must\nbe equal to the bit-channel capacity, and on the other hand, the average\nbit-metric value of a wrong branch can be at most zero. This implies that a\nwrong path's partial path metric value deviates from the bit-channel capacity's\npartial summation. For relatively reliable bit-channels, the bit metric for a\nwrong branch becomes very large negative number, which enables us to detect and\nprune such paths. We prove that, for a threshold lower than the bit-channel\ncutoff rate, the probability of pruning the correct path decreases\nexponentially by the given threshold. Based on these findings, we presented a\npruning technique, and the experimental results demonstrate a substantial\ndecrease in the amount of sorting procedures required for SCL decoding.

    "abstract": "Negative sequential pattern mining (SPM) is an important SPM research topic.\nUnlike positive SPM, negative SPM can discover events that should have occurred\nbut have not occurred, and it can be used for financial risk management and\nfraud detection. However, existing methods generally ignore the repetitions of\nthe pattern and do not consider gap constraints, which can lead to mining\nresults containing a large number of patterns that users are not interested in.\nTo solve this problem, this paper discovers frequent one-off negative\nsequential patterns (ONPs). This problem has the following two characteristics.\nFirst, the support is calculated under the one-off condition, which means that\nany character in the sequence can only be used once at most. Second, the gap\nconstraint can be given by the user. To efficiently mine patterns, this paper\nproposes the ONP-Miner algorithm, which employs depth-first and backtracking\nstrategies to calculate the support. Therefore, ONP-Miner can effectively avoid\ncreating redundant nodes and parent-child relationships. Moreover, to\neffectively reduce the number of candidate patterns, ONP-Miner uses pattern\njoin and pruning strategies to generate and further prune the candidate\npatterns, respectively. Experimental results show that ONP-Miner not only\nimproves the mining efficiency, but also has better mining performance than the\nstate-of-the-art algorithms. More importantly, ONP mining can find more\ninteresting patterns in traffic volume data to predict future traffic.",

Despite its simplicity, solving jigsaw puzzle has been demonstrated to be\nhelpful for diverse tasks using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), such as\nself-supervised feature representation learning, domain generalization, and\nfine-grained classification.\nIn this paper, we explore solving jigsaw puzzle as a self-supervised\nauxiliary loss in ViT for image classification, named Jigsaw-ViT.

It can be a promising\nalternative to classical image-domain methods and enjoys great advantages in\nmemory saving and computational efficiency. However, previous attempts on CL\nare not only limited to a fixed CS ratio, which lacks flexibility, but also\nlimited to MNIST/CIFAR-like datasets and do not scale to complex real-world\nhigh-resolution (HR) data or vision tasks. In this paper, a novel\ntransformer-based compressive learning framework on large-scale images with\narbitrary CS ratios, dubbed TransCL, is proposed. Specifically, TransCL first\nutilizes the strategy of learnable block-based compressed sensing and proposes\na flexible linear projection strategy to enable CL to be performed on\nlarge-scale images in an efficient block-by-block manner with arbitrary CS\nratios. Then, regarding CS measurements from all blocks as a sequence, a pure\ntransformer-based backbone is deployed to perform vision tasks with various\ntask-oriented heads. Our sufficient analysis presents that TransCL exhibits\nstrong resistance to interference and robust adaptability to arbitrary CS\nratios. Extensive experiments for complex HR data demonstrate that the proposed\nTransCL can achieve state-of-the-art performance in image classification and\nsemantic segmentation tasks. In particular, TransCL with a CS ratio of $10\\%$\ncan obtain almost the same performance as when operating directly on the\noriginal data and can still obtain satisfying performance even with an\nextremely low CS ratio of $1\\%$.

    "abstract": "This paper studies the optimal mechanisms for the vertically integrated\nutility to dispatch and incentivize the third-party demand response (DR)\nproviders in its territory. A framework is proposed, with three-layer coupled\nStackelberg and simultaneous games, to study the interactions and competitions\namong the profit-seeking process of the utility, the third-party DR providers,\nand the individual end users (EUs) in the DR programs. Two coupled\nsingle-leader-multiple-followers Stackelberg games with a three-layer structure\nare proposed to capture the interactions among the utility (modeled in the\nupper layer), the third-party DR providers (modeled in the middle layer), and\nthe EUs in each DR program (modeled in the lower layer). The competitions among\nthe EUs in each DR program is captured through a non-cooperative simultaneous\ngame. An inconvenience cost function is proposed to model the DR provision\nwillingness and capacity of different EUs. The Stackelberg game between the\nmiddle-layer DR provider and the lower-layer EUs is solved by converting the\noriginal bi-level programming to a singlelevel programming. This converted\nsingle-level programming is embedded in an iterative algorithm toward solving\nthe entire coupled games framework. Case studies are performed on IEEE 34-bus\nand IEEE 69-bus test systems to illustrate the application of the proposed\nframework.",

In recent years, this approach was successfully used for test\ncampaigns of deep learning frameworks.\nObjective: There is little knowledge on the application of differential\ntesting beyond deep learning. Within this article, we want to close this gap\nfor classification algorithms.\nMethod: We conduct a case study using Scikit-learn, Weka, Spark MLlib, and\nCaret in which we identify the potential of differential testing by considering\nwhich algorithms are available in multiple frameworks, the feasibility by\nidentifying pairs of algorithms that should exhibit the same behavior, and the\neffectiveness by executing tests for the identified pairs and analyzing the\ndeviations.\nResults: While we found a large potential for popular algorithms, the\nfeasibility seems limited because often it is not possible to determine\nconfigurations that are the same in other frameworks. The execution of the\nfeasible tests revealed that there is a large amount of deviations for the\nscores and classes. Only a lenient approach based on statistical significance\nof classes does not lead to a huge amount of test failures.\nConclusions: The potential of differential testing beyond deep learning seems\nlimited for research into the quality of machine learning libraries.\nPractitioners may still use the approach if they have deep knowledge about\nimplementations, especially if a coarse oracle that only considers significant\ndifferences of classes is sufficient.",

Though charging stations\ncan install battery energy storage to reduce their impacts on the grid, the\nconventional \"one charging station, one battery storage\" method may be\nuneconomical due to the high upfront cost of battery storage. Shared energy\nstorage can be a potential solution. However, effective management of charging\nstations with shared energy storage in a distribution network is challenging\ndue to the complex coupling, competing interests, and information asymmetry\nbetween different agents. To address the aforementioned challenges, this paper\nproposes a distributed coordination mechanism, with a prediction and a\ncorrection step, to guide the behaviors of different agents. In particular,\nthree groups of strategic agents are involved. Each charging station determines\nthe flexible EV charging plan inside it; each shared energy storage operator\ndecides on the amount of energy provided to its connected charging stations;\nand the distribution system operator monitors power flow in the network. We\ntheoretically prove that the proposed mechanism will converge to the centrally\noptimal solution. Numerical experiments and comprehensive performance\ncomparisons are conducted to validate the theoretical results and show the\nadvantages of the proposed mechanism.",

Finally, to explicitly learn the scale invariance of the scene\ndepth, we formulate a cross-scale depth consistency loss on depth predictions\nwith different scales.

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning has shown great promise in the field of graph\nrepresentation learning. By manually constructing positive/negative samples,\nmost graph contrastive learning methods rely on the vector inner product based\nsimilarity metric to distinguish the samples for graph representation. However,\nthe handcrafted sample construction (e.g., the perturbation on the nodes or\nedges of the graph) may not effectively capture the intrinsic local structures\nof the graph. Also, the vector inner product based similarity metric cannot\nfully exploit the local structures of the graph to characterize the graph\ndifference well. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel adaptive\nsubgraph generation based contrastive learning framework for efficient and\nrobust self-supervised graph representation learning, and the optimal transport\ndistance is utilized as the similarity metric between the subgraphs. It aims to\ngenerate contrastive samples by capturing the intrinsic structures of the graph\nand distinguish the samples based on the features and structures of subgraphs\nsimultaneously. Specifically, for each center node, by adaptively learning\nrelation weights to the nodes of the corresponding neighborhood, we first\ndevelop a network to generate the interpolated subgraph. We then construct the\npositive and negative pairs of subgraphs from the same and different nodes,\nrespectively.

    "abstract": "This paper presents an optimal motion planning framework to generate\nversatile energy-optimal quadrupedal jumping motions automatically (e.g.,\nflips, spin). The jumping motions via the centroidal dynamics are formulated as\na 12-dimensional black-box optimization problem subject to the robot\nkino-dynamic constraints. Gradient-based approaches offer great success in\naddressing trajectory optimization (TO), yet, prior knowledge (e.g., reference\nmotion, contact schedule) is required and results in sub-optimal solutions. The\nnew proposed framework first employed a heuristics-based optimization method to\navoid these problems. Moreover, a prioritization fitness function is created\nfor heuristics-based algorithms in robot ground reaction force (GRF) planning,\nenhancing convergence and searching performance considerably. Since\nheuristics-based algorithms often require significant time, motions are planned\noffline and stored as a pre-motion library. A selector is designed to\nautomatically choose motions with user-specified or perception information as\ninput. The proposed framework has been successfully validated only with a\nsimple continuously tracking PD controller in an open-source Mini-Cheetah by\nseveral challenging jumping motions, including jumping over a window-shaped\nobstacle with 30 cm height and left-flipping over a rectangle obstacle with 27\ncm height.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has achieved great success in the past few years. However, the\nperformance of deep learning is likely to impede in face of non-IID situations.\nDomain generalization (DG) enables a model to generalize to an unseen test\ndistribution, i.e., to learn domain-invariant representations. In this paper,\nwe argue that domain-invariant features should be originating from both\ninternal and mutual sides. Internal invariance means that the features can be\nlearned with a single domain and the features capture intrinsic semantics of\ndata, i.e., the property within a domain, which is agnostic to other domains.\nMutual invariance means that the features can be learned with multiple domains\n(cross-domain) and the features contain common information, i.e., the\ntransferable features w.r.t. other domains. We then propose DIFEX for\nDomain-Invariant Feature EXploration. DIFEX employs a knowledge distillation\nframework to capture the high-level Fourier phase as the internally-invariant\nfeatures and learn cross-domain correlation alignment as the mutually-invariant\nfeatures. We further design an exploration loss to increase the feature\ndiversity for better generalization.

    "abstract": "Sharing economy has become a socio-economic trend in transportation and\nhousing sectors. It develops business models leveraging underutilized\nresources. Like those sectors, power grid is also becoming smarter with many\nflexible resources, and researchers are investigating the impact of sharing\nresources here as well that can help to reduce cost and extract value. In this\nwork, we investigate sharing of energy storage devices among individual\nhouseholds in a cooperative fashion. Coalitional game theory is used to model\nthe scenario where utility company imposes time-of-use (ToU) price and net\nmetering billing mechanism. The resulting game has a non-empty core and we can\ndevelop a cost allocation mechanism in the core with easy to compute analytical\nformula. A mechanism for sharing the excess energy under the peer to peer\nnetwork (P2P) is also developed. Thus sharing electricity generated by storage\ndevices among consumers can be effective in this set-up. Our simulation results\nalso validate the theoretical claim.",

It is\nvital to ensure the safety of a quadrotor both in normal state and in abnormal\nstate if a controller tends to make the quadrotor unsafe. To this end, this\npaper proposes a non-cascaded Control Barrier Function (CBF) for a quadrotor\ncontrolled by either cascaded controllers or a non-cascaded controller.\nIncorporated with a Quadratic Programming (QP), the non-cascaded CBF can\nsimultaneously regulate the magnitude of the total thrust and the torque of the\nquadrotor determined a controller, so as to ensure the safety of the quadrotor\nboth in normal state and in abnormal state. The non-cascaded CBF establishes a\nnon-conservative forward invariant safe region, in which the controller of a\nquadrotor is fully or partially effective in the navigation or the pose control\nof the quadrotor.

    "abstract": "A wide range of price-based congestion management schemes were proposed in\nthe literature ranging from marginal cost road pricing to trip based multimodal\npricing. The underlying models were formulated under different theoretical\nassumptions and with varying, and sometimes conflicting objectives. This paper\npresents a unifying framework under which different approaches can be compared\nbased on their respective assumptions. The unifying modelling framework is\nreferred to as trip pricing model, which extends path-differentiated pricing to\nmultimodal paths, i.e., trips on whatever mode or combinations of modes, and\ngeneralizes road pricing schemes (which are shown to be a special case). By\nsetting both positive (tolls) and negative (incentives) prices, revenue-neutral\nschemes are also shown to be special cases, with no a-priori assumption on\nwhich paths/modes to toll/incentivize. For model comparison, the pricing design\nproblem is formulated in a multi-objective optimization framework, which\ncombines traffic efficiency, environmental sustainability, users' acceptance,\nsocial and spatial equity, as pricing objectives. The trip pricing scheme is\ncompared with traditional road pricing schemes, and with their revenue-neutral\nvariants. First-best and second-best pricing schemes, designed in single- and\nmulti-objective optimization frameworks, are compared on the Nguyen-Dupuis\nnetwork. Results suggest a vast potential for multi-objective trip congestion\npricing over single-objective road pricing. In addition, the application of\nboth positive and negative prices is shown to significantly increase the\nexpected acceptance of pricing schemes and to preserve efficiency and\nsustainability objectives. The results should promote the design of more\neffective pricing policies, i.e., set of pricing rules easier to communicate,\nbased on now available technologies of passengers' tracking and pricing.",

To this end, we pre-learn a feature space independently from the object\ndetection, and encode images using BoVW in this space. The obtained BoVW\nrepresentation for an image can be considered as distilled knowledge to guide\nthe learning of object detector: the extracted features by the object detector\nfor the same image are expected to derive the consistent BoVW representations\nwith the distilled knowledge.

    "abstract": "User interaction (UI) logs are high-resolution event logs that record\nlow-level activities performed by a user during the execution of a task in an\ninformation system. Each event in a UI log corresponds to a single interaction\nbetween the user and the interface, such as clicking a button or entering a\nstring into a text field. UI logs are used for purposes like task mining or\nrobotic process automation (RPA), but each study and tool relies on a different\nconceptualization and implementation of the elements and attributes that\nconstitute user interactions. This lack of standardization makes it difficult\nto integrate UI logs from different sources and to combine tools for UI data\ncollection with downstream analytics or automation solutions. To address this,\nwe propose a universally applicable reference data model for process-related UI\nlogs. Based on a review of scientific literature and industry solutions, this\nmodel includes the core attributes of UI logs, but remains flexible with regard\nto the scope, level of abstraction, and case notion. We provide an\nimplementation of the model as an extension to the XES interchange standard for\nevent logs and demonstrate its practical applicability in a real-life RPA\nscenario.",

    "abstract": "Continual learning is a learning paradigm that learns tasks sequentially with\nresources constraints, in which the key challenge is stability-plasticity\ndilemma, i.e., it is uneasy to simultaneously have the stability to prevent\ncatastrophic forgetting of old tasks and the plasticity to learn new tasks\nwell. In this paper, we propose a new continual learning approach, Advanced\nNull Space (AdNS), to balance the stability and plasticity without storing any\nold data of previous tasks. Specifically, to obtain better stability, AdNS\nmakes use of low-rank approximation to obtain a novel null space and projects\nthe gradient onto the null space to prevent the interference on the past tasks.\nTo control the generation of the null space, we introduce a non-uniform\nconstraint strength to further reduce forgetting. Furthermore, we present a\nsimple but effective method, intra-task distillation, to improve the\nperformance of the current task. Finally, we theoretically find that null space\nplays a key role in plasticity and stability, respectively. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed method can achieve better performance compared\nto state-of-the-art continual learning approaches.",

When operating within competitive, ever-changing\nenvironments, such systems must distribute their internal assets wisely so as\nto improve and adapt their ability to extract available resources.

In this paper, we expand on a\nplant-inspired asset-distribution model and introduce a more general\nmulti-scale model applicable across a wider range of natural and artificial\nsystem domains. We study the impact that the topology of the multi-scale\ncontrol process has upon the system's ability to self-adapt asset distribution\nwhen resource availability changes within the environment.

The fusion is commonly carried out in a\nmodel-based extended Kalman filter framework. One of the critical parameters of\nthe filter is the process noise covariance. It is responsible for the real-time\nsolution accuracy, as it considers both vehicle dynamics uncertainty and the\ninertial sensors quality. In most situations, the process noise is covariance\nassumed to be constant. Yet, due to vehicle dynamics and sensor measurement\nvariations throughout the trajectory, the process noise covariance is subject\nto change. To cope with such situations, several adaptive model-based Kalman\nfilters were suggested in the literature. In this paper, we propose a hybrid\nmodel and learning-based adaptive navigation filter. We rely on the model-based\nKalman filter and design a deep neural network model to tune the momentary\nsystem noise covariance matrix, based only on the inertial sensor readings.\nOnce the process noise covariance is learned, it is plugged into the\nwell-established, model-based Kalman filter. After deriving the proposed hybrid\nframework, field experiment results using a quadrotor are presented and a\ncomparison to model-based adaptive approaches is given.

Resource allocation is a prior solution to address\nvarious demanding situations like the under/overload handling, resource\nwastage, load balancing, Quality-of-Services (QoS) violations, VM migration and\nmany more.

A conceptual scheme for resource\nmanagement, grouping of current machine learning based resource allocation\nstrategies, and fundamental problems of ineffective distribution of physical\nresources are analyzed.

We apply the methods\nof entity linking, which links word strings to entities from a knowledge base,\nto extract main keywords in cloud computing from accumulated publications from\n2004 to 2021. Results suggest that in cloud computing research, Internet of\nthings has an accelerated technological and scientific growth compared to the\nother topics. Other critical research fields that support the evolution of\ncloud computing are mathematical optimization and virtual machine.

Moreover, this study shows that technological development of virtual\nmachines and computing device can be of critical importance to foster an\neconomic and technological change in many sectors.

Recently, some works have managed\nto select the accurate boxes generated from a well-trained WSOD network to\nsupervise a semi-supervised detection framework for better performance.\nHowever, these approaches simply divide the training set into labeled and\nunlabeled sets according to the image-level criteria, such that sufficient\nmislabeled or wrongly localized box predictions are chosen as pseudo\nground-truths, resulting in a sub-optimal solution of detection performance. To\novercome this issue, we propose a novel WSOD framework with a new paradigm that\nswitches from weak supervision to noisy supervision (W2N). Generally, with\ngiven pseudo ground-truths generated from the well-trained WSOD network, we\npropose a two-module iterative training algorithm to refine pseudo labels and\nsupervise better object detector progressively. In the localization adaptation\nmodule, we propose a regularization loss to reduce the proportion of\ndiscriminative parts in original pseudo ground-truths, obtaining better pseudo\nground-truths for further training. In the semi-supervised module, we propose a\ntwo tasks instance-level split method to select high-quality labels for\ntraining a semi-supervised detector. Experimental results on different\nbenchmarks verify the effectiveness of W2N, and our W2N outperforms all\nexisting pure WSOD methods and transfer learning methods.

The distillation\nprocess often happens at an external party side where we do not have access to\nmuch data, and the teacher does not disclose its parameters due to security and\nprivacy concerns.

We propose to narrow this gap by fine-tuning a\nbase pre-trained weakly-supervised detector with a few fully-annotated samples\nautomatically selected from the training set using ``box-in-box'' (BiB), a\nnovel active learning strategy designed specifically to address the\nwell-documented failure modes of weakly-supervised detectors.

BiB reaches 97%\nof the performance of fully-supervised Fast RCNN with only 10% of\nfully-annotated images on VOC07. On COCO, using on average 10 fully-annotated\nimages per class, or equivalently 1% of the training set, BiB also reduces the\nperformance gap (in AP) between the weakly-supervised detector and the\nfully-supervised Fast RCNN by over 70%, showing a good trade-off between\nperformance and data efficiency.

    "abstract": "Deep Learning approaches based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are\nextensively utilized and very successful in a wide range of application areas,\nincluding image classification and speech recognition. For the execution of\ntrained CNNs, i.e. model inference, we nowadays witness a shift from the Cloud\nto the Edge. Unfortunately, deploying and inferring large, compute and memory\nintensive CNNs on edge devices is challenging because these devices typically\nhave limited power budgets and compute/memory resources. One approach to\naddress this challenge is to leverage all available resources across multiple\nedge devices to deploy and execute a large CNN by properly partitioning the CNN\nand running each CNN partition on a separate edge device. Although such\ndistribution, deployment, and execution of large CNNs on multiple edge devices\nis a desirable and beneficial approach, there currently does not exist a design\nand programming framework that takes a trained CNN model, together with a CNN\npartitioning specification, and fully automates the CNN model splitting and\ndeployment on multiple edge devices to facilitate distributed CNN inference at\nthe Edge. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel framework, called\nAutoDiCE, for automated splitting of a CNN model into a set of sub-models and\nautomated code generation for distributed and collaborative execution of these\nsub-models on multiple, possibly heterogeneous, edge devices, while supporting\nthe exploitation of parallelism among and within the edge devices. Our\nexperimental results show that AutoDiCE can deliver distributed CNN inference\nwith reduced energy consumption and memory usage per edge device, and improved\noverall system throughput at the same time.",

Thus, conventional RSMA approaches usually fail to address the\nchallenges caused by computational demands at the transmitter, let alone the\ndynamic nature of the virtual reality streaming applications. To overcome the\naforementioned challenges, we first formulate the virtual reality streaming\nproblem assisted by RSMA as a joint communication and computation optimization\nproblem. A novel multicast approach is then proposed to cluster users into\ndifferent groups based on a Field-of-View metric and transmit multicast streams\nin a hierarchical manner. After that, we propose a deep reinforcement learning\napproach to obtain the solution for the optimization problem.

    "title": "Koopman Form of Nonlinear Systems with Inputs",
    "abstract": "The Koopman framework proposes a linear representation of finite dimensional\nnonlinear systems through a generally infinite dimensional globally linear\nrepresentation. Originally, the Koopman formalism has been described for\nautonomous systems and the extension for actuated continuous-time systems with\na linear input or a control affine form has only recently been addressed.\nHowever, such a derivation for discrete-time systems has not yet been\ndeveloped. Thus, a particular Koopman form is generally assumed, predominantly\na linear time invariant (LTI) model, as it facilitates the use of control\ntechniques such as linear quadratic regulation and model predictive control.\nHowever, we show that this assumption is insufficient to capture the dynamics\nof the underlying nonlinear system. In the present paper, we systematically\ninvestigate and analytically derive lifted forms under inputs for a general\nclass of nonlinear systems in both continuous and discrete time, using the\nfundamental theorem of calculus. We prove that the resulting lifted\nrepresentations give linear state-space Koopman models where the input matrix\nbecomes state (and input, for the discrete-time case)-dependent, hence it can\nbe seen as a specially structured linear parameter-varying (LPV) description of\nthe underlying system. We also provide error bounds on how much the parameter\nvariation contributes and how well the system behaviour can be approximated by\nan LTI Koopman representation. The introduced theoretical insight greatly helps\nfor performing proper model structure selection in system identification with\nKoopman models as well as making a proper choice for LTI or LPV techniques for\nthe control of nonlinear systems through the Koopman approach.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) transfers knowledge from a label-rich\nsource domain to a different but related fully-unlabeled target domain. To\naddress the problem of domain shift, more and more UDA methods adopt pseudo\nlabels of the target samples to improve the generalization ability on the\ntarget domain. However, inaccurate pseudo labels of the target samples may\nyield suboptimal performance with error accumulation during the optimization\nprocess. Moreover, once the pseudo labels are generated, how to remedy the\ngenerated pseudo labels is far from explored. In this paper, we propose a novel\napproach to improve the accuracy of the pseudo labels in the target domain. It\nfirst generates coarse pseudo labels by a conventional UDA method. Then, it\niteratively exploits the intra-class similarity of the target samples for\nimproving the generated coarse pseudo labels, and aligns the source and target\ndomains with the improved pseudo labels. The accuracy improvement of the pseudo\nlabels is made by first deleting dissimilar samples, and then using spanning\ntrees to eliminate the samples with the wrong pseudo labels in the intra-class\nsamples. We have applied the proposed approach to several conventional UDA\nmethods as an additional term. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed method can boost the accuracy of the pseudo labels and further lead to\nmore discriminative and domain invariant features than the conventional\nbaselines.",

    "abstract": "Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) achieves higher sample efficiency in\npractice than model-free RL by learning a dynamics model to generate samples\nfor policy learning. Previous works learn a \"global\" dynamics model to fit the\nstate-action visitation distribution for all historical policies. However, in\nthis paper, we find that learning a global dynamics model does not necessarily\nbenefit model prediction for the current policy since the policy in use is\nconstantly evolving. The evolving policy during training will cause\nstate-action visitation distribution shifts. We theoretically analyze how the\ndistribution of historical policies affects the model learning and model\nrollouts. We then propose a novel model-based RL method, named\n\\textit{Policy-adaptation Model-based Actor-Critic (PMAC)}, which learns a\npolicy-adapted dynamics model based on a policy-adaptation mechanism. This\nmechanism dynamically adjusts the historical policy mixture distribution to\nensure the learned model can continually adapt to the state-action visitation\ndistribution of the evolving policy. Experiments on a range of continuous\ncontrol environments in MuJoCo show that PMAC achieves state-of-the-art\nasymptotic performance and almost two times higher sample efficiency than prior\nmodel-based methods.",

Drowsy and distracted driving\nare the cause of 45% of all car crashes.

This work investigated the use\nof the vision transformer to outperform state-of-the-art accuracy from 3D-CNNs.\nTwo separate transformers were trained for drowsiness and distractedness. The\ndrowsy video transformer model was trained on the National Tsing-Hua University\nDrowsy Driving Dataset (NTHU-DDD) with a Video Swin Transformer model for 10\nepochs on two classes -- drowsy and non-drowsy simulated over 10.5 hours. The\ndistracted video transformer was trained on the Driver Monitoring Dataset (DMD)\nwith Video Swin Transformer for 50 epochs over 9 distraction-related classes.\nThe accuracy of the drowsiness model reached 44% and a high loss value on the\ntest set, indicating overfitting and poor model performance. Overfitting\nindicates limited training data and applied model architecture lacked\nquantifiable parameters to learn. The distracted model outperformed\nstate-of-the-art models on DMD reaching 97.5%, indicating that with sufficient\ndata and a strong architecture, transformers are suitable for unfit driving\ndetection.

DeepFakes\nand spoofing highlight the feebleness of the link between physical reality and\nits abstract representation, whether learned by a digital computer or a\nbiological agent. Starting from a widely applicable definition of abstract\nconcept, we show that standard feed-forward architectures cannot capture but\ntrivial concepts, regardless of the number of weights and the amount of\ntraining data, despite being extremely effective classifiers. On the other\nhand, architectures that incorporate recursion can represent a significantly\nlarger class of concepts, but may still be unable to learn them from a finite\ndataset. We qualitatively describe the class of concepts that can be\n\"understood\" by modern architectures trained with variants of stochastic\ngradient descent, using a (free energy) Lagrangian to measure information\ncomplexity. Even if a concept has been understood, however, a network has no\nmeans of communicating its understanding to an external agent, except through\ncontinuous interaction and validation. We then characterize physical objects as\nabstract concepts and use the previous analysis to show that physical objects\ncan be encoded by finite architectures. However, to understand physical\nconcepts, sensors must provide persistently exciting observations, for which\nthe ability to control the data acquisition process is essential (active\nperception). The importance of control depends on the modality, benefiting\nvisual more than acoustic or chemical perception.

We\nshow that for the short range potential of the nonlinear Schr{\\\"o}dinger\nequation, the integrating factor technique performs better than splitting\nalgorithms, while, for the long range potential of the Schr{\\\"o}dinger-Newton\nequation, it depends on the particular system considered.",

    "title": "COSIME: FeFET based Associative Memory for In-Memory Cosine Similarity  Search",
    "abstract": "In a number of machine learning models, an input query is searched across the\ntrained class vectors to find the closest feature class vector in cosine\nsimilarity metric. However, performing the cosine similarities between the\nvectors in Von-Neumann machines involves a large number of multiplications,\nEuclidean normalizations and division operations, thus incurring heavy hardware\nenergy and latency overheads. Moreover, due to the memory wall problem that\npresents in the conventional architecture, frequent cosine similarity-based\nsearches (CSSs) over the class vectors requires a lot of data movements,\nlimiting the throughput and efficiency of the system. To overcome the\naforementioned challenges, this paper introduces COSIME, an general in-memory\nassociative memory (AM) engine based on the ferroelectric FET (FeFET) device\nfor efficient CSS. By leveraging the one-transistor AND gate function of FeFET\ndevices, current-based translinear analog circuit and winner-take-all (WTA)\ncircuitry, COSIME can realize parallel in-memory CSS across all the entries in\na memory block, and output the closest word to the input query in cosine\nsimilarity metric. Evaluation results at the array level suggest that the\nproposed COSIME design achieves 333X and 90.5X latency and energy improvements,\nrespectively, and realizes better classification accuracy when compared with an\nAM design implementing approximated CSS. The proposed in-memory computing\nfabric is evaluated for an HDC problem, showcasing that COSIME can achieve on\naverage 47.1X and 98.5X speedup and energy efficiency improvements compared\nwith an GPU implementation.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning systems, especially the methods based on deep learning,\nenjoy great success in modern computer vision tasks under experimental\nsettings. Generally, these classic deep learning methods are built on the\n\\emph{i.i.d.} assumption, supposing the training and test data are drawn from a\nsimilar distribution independently and identically. However, the aforementioned\n\\emph{i.i.d.} assumption is in general unavailable in the real-world scenario,\nand as a result, leads to sharp performance decay of deep learning algorithms.\nBehind this, domain shift is one of the primary factors to be blamed. In order\nto tackle this problem, we propose using \\textbf{Po}tential \\textbf{E}nergy\n\\textbf{R}anking (PoER) to decouple the object feature and the domain feature\n(\\emph{i.e.,} appearance feature) in given images, promoting the learning of\nlabel-discriminative features while filtering out the irrelevant correlations\nbetween the objects and the background. PoER helps the neural networks to\ncapture label-related features which contain the domain information first in\nshallow layers and then distills the label-discriminative representations out\nprogressively, enforcing the neural networks to be aware of the characteristic\nof objects and background which is vital to the generation of domain-invariant\nfeatures. PoER reports superior performance on domain generalization\nbenchmarks, improving the average top-1 accuracy by at least 1.20\\% compared to\nthe existing methods. Moreover, we use PoER in the ECCV 2022 NICO\nChallenge\\footnote{https://nicochallenge.com}, achieving top place with only a\nvanilla ResNet-18.

    "abstract": "While much attention has been devoted to the causes of opinion change, little\nis known about its consequences. Our study sheds a light on the relationship\nbetween one user's opinion change episode and subsequent behavioral change on\nan online social media, Reddit. In particular, we look at r/ChangeMyView, an\nonline community dedicated to debating one's own opinions. Interestingly, this\nforum adopts a well-codified schema for explicitly self-reporting opinion\nchange. Starting from this ground truth, we analyze changes in future online\ninformation consumption behavior that arise after a self-reported opinion\nchange on sociopolitical topics; and in particular, operationalized in this\nwork as the participation to sociopolitical subreddits. Such participation\nprofile is important as it represents one's information diet, and is a reliable\nproxy for, e.g., political affiliation or health choices.\nWe find that people who report an opinion change are significantly more\nlikely to change their future participation in a specific subset of online\ncommunities. We characterize which communities are more likely to be abandoned\nafter opinion change, and find a significant association (r=0.46) between\npropaganda-like language used in a community and the increase in chances of\nleaving it. We find comparable results (r=0.39) for the opposite direction,\ni.e., joining a community. This finding suggests how propagandistic communities\nact as a first gateway to internalize a shift in one's sociopolitical opinion.\nFinally, we show that the textual content of the discussion associated with\nopinion change is indicative of which communities are going to be subject to a\nparticipation change. In fact, a predictive model based only on the opinion\nchange post is able to pinpoint these communities with an AP@5 of 0.20, similar\nto what can be reached by using all the past history of participation in\ncommunities.",

Unfortunately, the ability of these devices to sense and share\nvarious physical parameters, although play a key role in these smart systems\nbut also causes the threat of breach of the privacy of the users. Existing\nsolutions for privacy-preserving computation for decentralized systems either\nuse too complex cryptographic techniques or exploit an extremely high degree of\nmessage passing and hence, are not suitable for the resource-constrained IoT\ndevices that constitute a significant fraction of a smart system.

The design of the strategy is based on\ndecentralized and collaborative data obfuscation and does not exploit any\ndependency on any trusted third party. In addition, besides minimizing the\ncommunication requirements, we make appropriate use of the recent advances in\nSynchronous-Transmission (ST)-based protocols in our design to accomplish the\ngoal efficiently. Extensive evaluation based on comprehensive experiments in\nboth simulation platforms and publicly available WSN/IoT testbeds demonstrates\nthat our strategy works up to at least 51.7% faster and consumes 50.5% lesser\nenergy compared to the existing state-of-the-art strategies.",

    "title": "Calibrated One-class Classification for Unsupervised Time Series Anomaly  Detection",
    "abstract": "Unsupervised time series anomaly detection is instrumental in monitoring and\nalarming potential faults of target systems in various domains. Current\nstate-of-the-art time series anomaly detectors mainly focus on devising\nadvanced neural network structures and new reconstruction/prediction learning\nobjectives to learn data normality (normal patterns and behaviors) as\naccurately as possible. However, these one-class learning methods can be\ndeceived by unknown anomalies in the training data (i.e., anomaly\ncontamination). Further, their normality learning also lacks knowledge about\nthe anomalies of interest. Consequently, they often learn a biased, inaccurate\nnormality boundary. This paper proposes a novel one-class learning approach,\nnamed calibrated one-class classification, to tackle this problem. Our\none-class classifier is calibrated in two ways: (1) by adaptively penalizing\nuncertain predictions, which helps eliminate the impact of anomaly\ncontamination while accentuating the predictions that the one-class model is\nconfident in, and (2) by discriminating the normal samples from native anomaly\nexamples that are generated to simulate genuine time series abnormal behaviors\non the basis of original data. These two calibrations result in\ncontamination-tolerant, anomaly-informed one-class learning, yielding a\nsignificantly improved normality modeling. Extensive experiments on six\nreal-world datasets show that our model substantially outperforms twelve\nstate-of-the-art competitors and obtains 6% - 31% F1 score improvement.

We find that adversarial samples usually\nhave larger adversarial MI and smaller natural MI compared with those w.r.t.\nnatural samples. Motivated by this observation, we propose to enhance the\nadversarial robustness by maximizing the natural MI and minimizing the\nadversarial MI during the training process.

    "abstract": "Formal XAI (explainable AI) is a growing area that focuses on computing\nexplanations with mathematical guarantees for the decisions made by ML models.\nInside formal XAI, one of the most studied cases is that of explaining the\nchoices taken by decision trees, as they are traditionally deemed as one of the\nmost interpretable classes of models. Recent work has focused on studying the\ncomputation of \"sufficient reasons\", a kind of explanation in which given a\ndecision tree $T$ and an instance $x$, one explains the decision $T(x)$ by\nproviding a subset $y$ of the features of $x$ such that for any other instance\n$z$ compatible with $y$, it holds that $T(z) = T(x)$, intuitively meaning that\nthe features in $y$ are already enough to fully justify the classification of\n$x$ by $T$. It has been argued, however, that sufficient reasons constitute a\nrestrictive notion of explanation, and thus the community has started to study\ntheir probabilistic counterpart, in which one requires that the probability of\n$T(z) = T(x)$ must be at least some value $\\delta \\in (0, 1]$, where $z$ is a\nrandom instance that is compatible with $y$. Our paper settles the\ncomputational complexity of $\\delta$-sufficient-reasons over decision trees,\nshowing that both (1) finding $\\delta$-sufficient-reasons that are minimal in\nsize, and (2) finding $\\delta$-sufficient-reasons that are minimal\ninclusion-wise, do not admit polynomial-time algorithms (unless P=NP). This is\nin stark contrast with the deterministic case ($\\delta = 1$) where\ninclusion-wise minimal sufficient-reasons are easy to compute. By doing this,\nwe answer two open problems originally raised by Izza et al. On the positive\nside, we identify structural restrictions of decision trees that make the\nproblem tractable, and show how SAT solvers might be able to tackle these\nproblems in practical settings.",

It is nontrivial to solve the proposed model\nbecause the eigenvalues of normalized symmetric Laplacian are functions of the\ndecision variable. We provide a majorization-minimization algorithm with\nconvergence guarantee to solve the optimization problem of LaptSNE and show how\nto calculate the gradient analytically, which may be of broad interest when\nconsidering optimization with Laplacian-composited objective.

    "abstract": "Robots applied in therapeutic scenarios, for instance in the therapy of\nindividuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder, are sometimes used for imitation\nlearning activities in which a person needs to repeat motions by the robot. To\nsimplify the task of incorporating new types of motions that a robot can\nperform, it is desirable that the robot has the ability to learn motions by\nobserving demonstrations from a human, such as a therapist. In this paper, we\ninvestigate an approach for acquiring motions from skeleton observations of a\nhuman, which are collected by a robot-centric RGB-D camera. Given a sequence of\nobservations of various joints, the joint positions are mapped to match the\nconfiguration of a robot before being executed by a PID position controller. We\nevaluate the method, in particular the reproduction error, by performing a\nstudy with QTrobot in which the robot acquired different upper-body dance moves\nfrom multiple participants. The results indicate the method's overall\nfeasibility, but also indicate that the reproduction quality is affected by\nnoise in the skeleton observations.",

For\ninstance, Resistive Memory (ReRAM) based PIM architectures are widely known for\ntheir inherent dot-product computation capability. While the performance of\nsuch architecture is essential, reliability and accuracy are also important,\nespecially in mission-critical real-time systems. Unfortunately, the PIM\narchitectures have a fundamental limitation in guaranteeing error-free\noperation. As a result, current methods must pay high implementation costs or\nperformance penalties to achieve reliable execution in the PIM accelerator. In\nthis paper, we make a fundamental observation of this reliability limitation of\nReRAM based PIM architecture. Accordingly, we propose a novel solution--Falut\nTolerant PIM or FAT-PIM, that can improve reliability for such systems\nsignificantly at a low cost. Our evaluation shows that we can improve the error\ntolerance significantly with only 4.9% performance cost and 3.9% storage\noverhead.",

The IAC is a\ncompetition with full-scale autonomous race car that can drive up to 290\nkm/h(180mph). Due to its high-speed and heavy vibration of the race car,\nGPS/INS system is prone to be degraded. These degraded GPS measurements can\ncause a critical localization error leading to a serious crashing accidents. To\nthis end, we propose a robust navigation system to implement multi-sensor\nfusion Kalman filter. In this study, we present how to identify the degradation\nof measurement based on probabilistic approaches. Based on this approach, we\ncould compute optimal measurement values for Kalman filter correction step. At\nthe same time, we present the other resilient navigation system so that race\ncar can follow the race track in fatal localization failure situations. In\naddition, this paper also covers the optimal path planning algorithm for\nobstacle avoidance. To take account for original optimal racing line,\nobstacles, vehicle dynamics, we propose a road-graph-based path planning\nalgorithm to guarantee our race car drives in-bounded conditions. In the\nexperiments, we will evaluate our designed localization system can handle the\ndegraded data, and sometimes prevent serious crashing accidents while\nhigh-speed driving.

For semi-supervised\nlearning of latent state TOD models, variational learning is often used, but\nsuffers from the annoying high-variance of the gradients propagated through\ndiscrete latent variables and the drawback of indirectly optimizing the target\nlog-likelihood. Recently, an alternative algorithm, called joint stochastic\napproximation (JSA), has emerged for learning discrete latent variable models\nwith impressive performances. In this paper, we propose to apply JSA to\nsemi-supervised learning of the latent state TOD models, which is referred to\nas JSA-TOD. To our knowledge, JSA-TOD represents the first work in developing\nJSA based semi-supervised learning of discrete latent variable conditional\nmodels for such long sequential generation problems like in TOD systems.\nExtensive experiments show that JSA-TOD significantly outperforms its\nvariational learning counterpart.

Nonetheless, viewing deep\nlearning as a dynamical system allows the use of established theories to\ninvestigate the behaviour of deep neural networks. In order to study the\nstability of the training process, in this article, we formulate training of\ndeep neural networks as a hydrodynamics system, which has a multisymplectic\nstructure. For that, the deep neural network is modelled using a stochastic\ndifferential equation and, thereby, mean-field type control is used to train\nit. The necessary conditions for optimality of the mean--field type control\nreduce to a system of Euler-Poincare equations, which has the a similar\ngeometric structure to that of compressible fluids. The mean-field type control\nis solved numerically using a multisymplectic numerical scheme that takes\nadvantage of the underlying geometry. Moreover, the numerical scheme, yields an\napproximated solution which is also an exact solution of a hydrodynamics system\nwith a multisymplectic structure and it can be analysed using backward error\nanalysis. Further, nonlinear stability yields the condition for selecting the\nnumber of hidden layers and the number of nodes per layer, that makes the\ntraining stable while approximating the solution of a residual neural network\nwith a number of hidden layers approaching infinity.",

Solutions involving\ndepth cameras are limited in range and to indoor spaces, and dense\nreconstruction systems based on minimising the photometric error between frames\nare typically poorly constrained and suffer from scale ambiguity. To address\nthese issues, we propose a 3D reconstruction system that leverages the output\nof a convolutional neural network (CNN) to produce fully dense depth maps for\nkeyframes that include metric scale.\nOur system, DeepFusion, is capable of producing real-time dense\nreconstructions on a GPU. It fuses the output of a semi-dense multiview stereo\nalgorithm with the depth and gradient predictions of a CNN in a probabilistic\nfashion, using learned uncertainties produced by the network. While the network\nonly needs to be run once per keyframe, we are able to optimise for the depth\nmap with each new frame so as to constantly make use of new geometric\nconstraints. Based on its performance on synthetic and real-world datasets, we\ndemonstrate that DeepFusion is capable of performing at least as well as other\ncomparable systems.",

These algorithmic\nprobability predictions do not depend on a detailed knowledge of how output\npatterns were produced, or historical statistical data.

    "abstract": "A hallmark of human intelligence is the ability to construct self-contained\nchunks of knowledge and reuse them in novel combinations for solving different\nproblems. Learning such compositional structures has been a challenge for\nartificial systems, due to the underlying combinatorial search. To date,\nresearch into compositional learning has largely proceeded separately from work\non lifelong or continual learning. This dissertation integrated these two lines\nof work to present a general-purpose framework for lifelong learning of\nfunctionally compositional structures. The framework separates the learning\ninto two stages: learning how to combine existing components to assimilate a\nnovel problem, and learning how to adapt the existing components to accommodate\nthe new problem. This separation explicitly handles the trade-off between\nstability and flexibility. This dissertation instantiated the framework into\nvarious supervised and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Supervised\nlearning evaluations found that 1) compositional models improve lifelong\nlearning of diverse tasks, 2) the multi-stage process permits lifelong learning\nof compositional knowledge, and 3) the components learned by the framework\nrepresent self-contained and reusable functions. Similar RL evaluations\ndemonstrated that 1) algorithms under the framework accelerate the discovery of\nhigh-performing policies, and 2) these algorithms retain or improve performance\non previously learned tasks. The dissertation extended one lifelong\ncompositional RL algorithm to the nonstationary setting, where the task\ndistribution varies over time, and found that modularity permits individually\ntracking changes to different elements in the environment. The final\ncontribution of this dissertation was a new benchmark for compositional RL,\nwhich exposed that existing methods struggle to discover the compositional\nproperties of the environment.",

    "abstract": "We are interested in learning robust models from insufficient data, without\nthe need for any externally pre-trained checkpoints. First, compared to\nsufficient data, we show why insufficient data renders the model more easily\nbiased to the limited training environments that are usually different from\ntesting. For example, if all the training swan samples are \"white\", the model\nmay wrongly use the \"white\" environment to represent the intrinsic class swan.\nThen, we justify that equivariance inductive bias can retain the class feature\nwhile invariance inductive bias can remove the environmental feature, leaving\nthe class feature that generalizes to any environmental changes in testing. To\nimpose them on learning, for equivariance, we demonstrate that any\noff-the-shelf contrastive-based self-supervised feature learning method can be\ndeployed; for invariance, we propose a class-wise invariant risk minimization\n(IRM) that efficiently tackles the challenge of missing environmental\nannotation in conventional IRM. State-of-the-art experimental results on\nreal-world benchmarks (VIPriors, ImageNet100 and NICO) validate the great\npotential of equivariance and invariance in data-efficient learning.

    "title": "GraphCFC: A Directed Graph based Cross-modal Feature Complementation  Approach for Multimodal Conversational Emotion Recognition",
    "abstract": "Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) plays a significant part in\nHuman-Computer Interaction (HCI) systems since it can provide empathetic\nservices. Multimodal ERC can mitigate the drawbacks of uni-modal approaches.\nRecently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used in a variety of\nfields due to their superior performance in relation modeling. In multimodal\nERC, GNNs are capable of extracting both long-distance contextual information\nand inter-modal interactive information. Unfortunately, since existing methods\nsuch as MMGCN directly fuse multiple modalities, redundant information may be\ngenerated and heterogeneous information may be lost. In this work, we present a\ndirected Graph based Cross-modal Feature Complementation (GraphCFC) module that\ncan efficiently model contextual and interactive information. GraphCFC\nalleviates the problem of heterogeneity gap in multimodal fusion by utilizing\nmultiple subspace extractors and Pair-wise Cross-modal Complementary (PairCC)\nstrategy. We extract various types of edges from the constructed graph for\nencoding, thus enabling GNNs to extract crucial contextual and interactive\ninformation more accurately when performing message passing. Furthermore, we\ndesign a GNN structure called GAT-MLP, which can provide a new unified network\nframework for multimodal learning. The experimental results on two benchmark\ndatasets show that our GraphCFC outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA)\napproaches.",

    "abstract": "Transfer learning through the use of pre-trained models has become a growing\ntrend for the machine learning community. Consequently, numerous pre-trained\nmodels are released online to facilitate further research. However, it raises\nextensive concerns on whether these pre-trained models would leak\nprivacy-sensitive information of their training data. Thus, in this work, we\naim to answer the following questions: \"Can we effectively recover private\ninformation from these pre-trained models? What are the sufficient conditions\nto retrieve such sensitive information?\" We first explore different statistical\ninformation which can discriminate the private training distribution from other\ndistributions. Based on our observations, we propose a novel private data\nreconstruction framework, SecretGen, to effectively recover private\ninformation. Compared with previous methods which can recover private data with\nthe ground true prediction of the targeted recovery instance, SecretGen does\nnot require such prior knowledge, making it more practical. We conduct\nextensive experiments on different datasets under diverse scenarios to compare\nSecretGen with other baselines and provide a systematic benchmark to better\nunderstand the impact of different auxiliary information and optimization\noperations. We show that without prior knowledge about true class prediction,\nSecretGen is able to recover private data with similar performance compared\nwith the ones that leverage such prior knowledge. If the prior knowledge is\ngiven, SecretGen will significantly outperform baseline methods. We also\npropose several quantitative metrics to further quantify the privacy\nvulnerability of pre-trained models, which will help the model selection for\nprivacy-sensitive applications.

    "abstract": "Human-in-the-loop approaches are of great importance for robot applications.\nIn the presented study, we implemented a multimodal human-robot interaction\n(HRI) scenario, in which a simulated robot communicates with its human partner\nthrough speech and gestures. The robot announces its intention verbally and\nselects the appropriate action using pointing gestures. The human partner, in\nturn, evaluates whether the robot's verbal announcement (intention) matches the\naction (pointing gesture) chosen by the robot. For cases where the verbal\nannouncement of the robot does not match the corresponding action choice of the\nrobot, we expect error-related potentials (ErrPs) in the human\nelectroencephalogram (EEG). These intrinsic evaluations of robot actions by\nhumans, evident in the EEG, were recorded in real time, continuously segmented\nonline and classified asynchronously. For feature selection, we propose an\napproach that allows the combinations of forward and backward sliding windows\nto train a classifier. We achieved an average classification performance of 91%\nacross 9 subjects. As expected, we also observed a relatively high variability\nbetween the subjects. In the future, the proposed feature selection approach\nwill be extended to allow for customization of feature selection. To this end,\nthe best combinations of forward and backward sliding windows will be\nautomatically selected to account for inter-subject variability in\nclassification performance. In addition, we plan to use the intrinsic human\nerror evaluation evident in the error case by the ErrP in interactive\nreinforcement learning to improve multimodal human-robot interaction.",

This has led to a\nnationwide call for models to predict hospitalization and severe illness in\npatients with COVID-19 to inform distribution of limited healthcare resources.\nWe respond to one of these calls specific to the pediatric population. To\naddress this challenge, we study two prediction tasks for the pediatric\npopulation using electronic health records: 1) predicting which children are\nmore likely to be hospitalized, and 2) among hospitalized children, which\nindividuals are more likely to develop severe symptoms.\nWe respond to the national Pediatric COVID-19 data challenge with a novel\nmachine learning model, MedML.

In the agricultural sector,\none of the main needs is to know at all times the extent of land occupied or\nnot by crops in order to improve production and profitability. The traditional\nmethods of calculation demand the collection of data manually and in person in\nthe field, causing high labor costs, execution times, and inaccuracy in the\nresults. The present work proposes a new method based on Deep Learning\ntechniques complemented with conventional programming for the determination of\nthe area of populated and unpopulated crop areas. We have considered as a case\nstudy one of the most recognized companies in the planting and harvesting of\nsugar cane in Ecuador. The strategy combines a Generative Adversarial Neural\nNetwork (GAN) that is trained on a dataset of aerial photographs of natural and\nurban landscapes to improve image resolution; a Convolutional Neural Network\n(CNN) trained on a dataset of aerial photographs of sugar cane plots to\ndistinguish populated or unpopulated crop areas; and a standard image\nprocessing module for the calculation of areas in a percentage manner. The\nexperiments performed demonstrate a significant improvement in the quality of\nthe aerial photographs as well as a remarkable differentiation between\npopulated and unpopulated crop areas, consequently, a more accurate result of\ncultivated and uncultivated areas. The proposed method can be extended to the\ndetection of possible pests, areas of weed vegetation, dynamic crop\ndevelopment, and both qualitative and quantitative quality control.",

    "abstract": "We propose a stable, parallel approach to train Wasserstein Conditional\nGenerative Adversarial Neural Networks (W-CGANs) under the constraint of a\nfixed computational budget. Differently from previous distributed GANs training\ntechniques, our approach avoids inter-process communications, reduces the risk\nof mode collapse and enhances scalability by using multiple generators, each\none of them concurrently trained on a single data label. The use of the\nWasserstein metric also reduces the risk of cycling by stabilizing the training\nof each generator. We illustrate the approach on the CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and\nImageNet1k datasets, three standard benchmark image datasets, maintaining the\noriginal resolution of the images for each dataset. Performance is assessed in\nterms of scalability and final accuracy within a limited fixed computational\ntime and computational resources. To measure accuracy, we use the inception\nscore, the Frechet inception distance, and image quality. An improvement in\ninception score and Frechet inception distance is shown in comparison to\nprevious results obtained by performing the parallel approach on deep\nconvolutional conditional generative adversarial neural networks (DC-CGANs) as\nwell as an improvement of image quality of the new images created by the GANs\napproach. Weak scaling is attained on both datasets using up to 2,000 NVIDIA\nV100 GPUs on the OLCF supercomputer Summit.",

    "abstract": "Predictive coding (PC) is an influential theory in computational\nneuroscience, which argues that the cortex forms unsupervised world models by\nimplementing a hierarchical process of prediction error minimization. PC\nnetworks (PCNs) are trained in two phases. First, neural activities are updated\nto optimize the network's response to external stimuli. Second, synaptic\nweights are updated to consolidate this change in activity -- an algorithm\ncalled \\emph{prospective configuration}. While previous work has shown how in\nvarious limits, PCNs can be found to approximate backpropagation (BP), recent\nwork has demonstrated that PCNs operating in this standard regime, which does\nnot approximate BP, nevertheless obtain competitive training and generalization\nperformance to BP-trained networks while outperforming them on tasks such as\nonline, few-shot, and continual learning, where brains are known to excel.\nDespite this promising empirical performance, little is understood\ntheoretically about the properties and dynamics of PCNs in this regime. In this\npaper, we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the properties of\nPCNs trained with prospective configuration. We first derive analytical results\nconcerning the inference equilibrium for PCNs and a previously unknown close\nconnection relationship to target propagation (TP). Secondly, we provide a\ntheoretical analysis of learning in PCNs as a variant of generalized\nexpectation-maximization and use that to prove the convergence of PCNs to\ncritical points of the BP loss function, thus showing that deep PCNs can, in\ntheory, achieve the same generalization performance as BP, while maintaining\ntheir unique advantages.",

Given the wide adoption of AR face filters and\nthe importance of faces in our social structures and relations, there is\nincreased interest by the scientific community to analyze the impact of such\nfilters from a psychological, artistic and sociological perspective.

However, the\nearly-injected single-shot backdoor attack is ineffective because: (1) the\nmaximum backdoor effectiveness is not reached at injection because of the\ndilution effect from normal local updates; (2) the backdoor effect decreases\nquickly as the backdoor will be overwritten by the newcoming normal local\nupdates. In this paper, we strengthen the early-injected single-shot backdoor\nattack utilizing FL model information leakage. We show that the FL convergence\ncan be expedited if the client trains on a dataset that mimics the distribution\nand gradients of the whole population. Based on this observation, we proposed a\ntwo-phase backdoor attack, which includes a preliminary phase for the\nsubsequent backdoor attack. In the preliminary phase, the attacker-controlled\nclient first launches a whole population distribution inference attack and then\ntrains on a locally crafted dataset that is aligned with both the gradient and\ninferred distribution. Benefiting from the preliminary phase, the later\ninjected backdoor achieves better effectiveness as the backdoor effect will be\nless likely to be diluted by the normal model updates. Extensive experiments\nare conducted on MNIST dataset under various data heterogeneity settings to\nevaluate the effectiveness of the proposed backdoor attack. Results show that\nthe proposed backdoor outperforms existing backdoor attacks in both success\nrate and longevity, even when defense mechanisms are in place.",

MTD invalidates the\nattackers' knowledge required to mask their physical attack. Secondly,\nconvolution neural networks (CNNs) are applied to localize line outage position\nfrom the compromised measurements. Finally, model agnostic meta-learning (MAML)\nis used to accelerate the training speed of CNN following the topology\nreconfigurations (due to MTD) and reduce the data/retraining time requirements.\nSimulations are carried out using IEEE test systems.

In this paper, we follow a simpler approach by deriving the\naerodynamic forces using a relatively small number of states and presenting\nthem in a simple state-space form. The formulation utilizes Prandtl's lifting\nline theory and Wagner's function to determine the unsteady aerodynamic forces\nacting on the wing in a simulation, which then are compared to experimental\ndata of the bat-inspired robot called the Aerobat. The simulated trailing-edge\nvortex shedding can be evaluated from this model, which then can be analyzed\nfor a wake-based gait design approach to improve the aerodynamic performance of\nthe robot.",

Providing robots with tactile capabilities similar to humans\nis thus essential for applications involving human-to-robot or robot-to-robot\ninteractions, particularly in those situations where a robot is expected to\ngrasp and manipulate complex objects not previously encountered. A critical\naspect for successful object grasp and manipulation is the use of high-quality\nfingertips equipped with multiple high-performance sensors, distributed\nappropriately across a specific contact surface.\nIn this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the use of two different\ntypes of commercially available robotic fingertips (BioTac and WTS-FT), each of\nwhich is equipped with multiple sensors distributed across the fingertips'\ncontact surface. We further demonstrate that, due to the high performance of\nthe fingertips, a complex adaptive grasping algorithm is not required for\ngrasping of everyday objects. We conclude that a simple algorithm based on a\nproportional controller will suffice for many grasping applications, provided\nthe relevant fingertips exhibit high sensitivity. In a quantified assessment,\nwe also demonstrate that, due in part to the sensor distribution, the\nBioTac-based fingertip performs better than the WTS-FT device, in enabling\nlifting of loads up to 850g, and that the simple proportional controller can\nadapt the grasp even when the object is exposed to significant external\nvibrational challenges.",

To assess a PSG, the FDA assessor needs to take extensive\ntime and effort to manually retrieve supportive drug information of absorption,\ndistribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) from the reference listed drug\nlabeling. In this work, we leveraged the state-of-the-art pre-trained language\nmodels to automatically label the ADME paragraphs in the pharmacokinetics\nsection from the FDA-approved drug labeling to facilitate PSG assessment.

There is little to no progress on\nstudying the DG performance of vision transformers (ViTs), which are\nchallenging the supremacy of CNNs on standard benchmarks, often built on i.i.d\nassumption. This renders the real-world deployment of ViTs doubtful. In this\npaper, we attempt to explore ViTs towards addressing the DG problem. Similar to\nCNNs, ViTs also struggle in out-of-distribution scenarios and the main culprit\nis overfitting to source domains. Inspired by the modular architecture of ViTs,\nwe propose a simple DG approach for ViTs, coined as self-distillation for ViTs.\nIt reduces the overfitting to source domains by easing the learning of\ninput-output mapping problem through curating non-zero entropy supervisory\nsignals for intermediate transformer blocks. Further, it does not introduce any\nnew parameters and can be seamlessly plugged into the modular composition of\ndifferent ViTs. We empirically demonstrate notable performance gains with\ndifferent DG baselines and various ViT backbones in five challenging datasets.\nMoreover, we report favorable performance against recent state-of-the-art DG\nmethods.

Based on the simulation results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, our method\nachieves a 16x compression ratio with negligible accuracy drops compared with\nthe vanilla SL. Moreover, C3-SL significantly reduces 1152x memory and 2.25x\ncomputation overhead compared to the state-of-the-art dimension-wise\ncompression method.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: To substantially shorten the acquisition time required for\nquantitative 3D chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) and semisolid\nmagnetization transfer (MT) imaging and allow for rapid chemical exchange\nparameter map reconstruction. Methods: Three-dimensional CEST and MT magnetic\nresonance fingerprinting (MRF) datasets of L-arginine phantoms, whole-brains,\nand calf muscles from healthy volunteers, cancer patients, and cardiac patients\nwere acquired using 3T clinical scanners at 3 different sites, using 3\ndifferent scanner models and coils. A generative adversarial network supervised\nframework (GAN-CEST) was then designed and trained to learn the mapping from a\nreduced input data space to the quantitative exchange parameter space, while\npreserving perceptual and quantitative content. Results: The GAN-CEST 3D\nacquisition time was 42-52 seconds, 70% shorter than CEST-MRF. The quantitative\nreconstruction of the entire brain took 0.8 seconds. An excellent agreement was\nobserved between the ground truth and GAN-based L-arginine concentration and pH\nvalues (Pearson's r > 0.97, NRMSE < 1.5%). GAN-CEST images from a brain-tumor\nsubject yielded a semi-solid volume fraction and exchange rate NRMSE of\n3.8$\\pm$1.3% and 4.6$\\pm$1.3%, respectively, and SSIM of 96.3$\\pm$1.6% and\n95.0$\\pm$2.4%, respectively. The mapping of the calf-muscle exchange parameters\nin a cardiac patient, yielded NRMSE < 7% and SSIM > 94% for the semi-solid\nexchange parameters. In regions with large susceptibility artifacts, GAN-CEST\nhas demonstrated improved performance and reduced noise compared to MRF.\nConclusion: GAN-CEST can substantially reduce the acquisition time for\nquantitative semisolid MT/CEST mapping, while retaining performance even when\nfacing pathologies and scanner models that were not available during training.",

    "abstract": "Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRH1R) is a promising therapeutic\ntarget for the treatment of uterine diseases. To date, several GnRH1R\nantagonists are available in clinical investigation without satisfying multiple\nproperty constraints. To fill this gap, we aim to develop a deep learning-based\nframework to facilitate the effective and efficient discovery of a new orally\nactive small-molecule drug targeting GnRH1R with desirable properties. In the\npresent work, a ligand-and-structure combined model, namely LS-MolGen, was\nfirstly proposed for molecular generation by fully utilizing the information on\nthe known active compounds and the structure of the target protein, which was\ndemonstrated by its superior performance than ligand- or structure-based\nmethods separately. Then, a in silico screening including activity prediction,\nADMET evaluation, molecular docking and FEP calculation was conducted, where\n~30,000 generated novel molecules were narrowed down to 8 for experimental\nsynthesis and validation. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that three of\nthem exhibited potent inhibition activities (compound 5 IC50 = 0.856 nM,\ncompound 6 IC50 = 0.901 nM, compound 7 IC50 = 2.54 nM) against GnRH1R, and\ncompound 5 performed well in fundamental PK properties, such as half-life, oral\nbioavailability, and PPB, etc. We believed that the proposed\nligand-and-structure combined molecular generative model and the whole\ncomputer-aided workflow can potentially be extended to similar tasks for de\nnovo drug design or lead optimization.",

Nonetheless, many\ninvariants have been proposed in the literature to study multiparameter\npersistence modules, though each invariant will lose some amount of\ninformation. One such invariant is the generalized rank invariant. This\ninvariant is known to be complete on the class of interval decomposable\npersistence modules in general, under mild assumptions on the indexing poset\n$P$.\nThere is often a trade-off, where the stronger an invariant is, the more\nexpensive it is to compute in practice.

We can interpolate\nbetween these two to induce new invariants via restricting the domain of the\ngeneralized rank invariant, and this family exhibits the aforementioned\ntrade-off. This work studies the tension which exists between computational\nefficiency and retaining strength when restricting the domain of the\ngeneralized rank invariant.

    "abstract": "Bayesian inference for high-dimensional inverse problems is challenged by the\ncomputational costs of the forward operator and the selection of an appropriate\nprior distribution. Amortized variational inference addresses these challenges\nwhere a neural network is trained to approximate the posterior distribution\nover existing pairs of model and data. When fed previously unseen data and\nnormally distributed latent samples as input, the pretrained deep neural\nnetwork -- in our case a conditional normalizing flow -- provides posterior\nsamples with virtually no cost. However, the accuracy of this approach relies\non the availability of high-fidelity training data, which seldom exists in\ngeophysical inverse problems due to the heterogeneous structure of the Earth.\nIn addition, accurate amortized variational inference requires the observed\ndata to be drawn from the training data distribution. As such, we propose to\nincrease the resilience of amortized variational inference when faced with data\ndistribution shift via a physics-based correction to the conditional\nnormalizing flow latent distribution. To accomplish this, instead of a standard\nGaussian latent distribution, we parameterize the latent distribution by a\nGaussian distribution with an unknown mean and diagonal covariance. These\nunknown quantities are then estimated by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence between the corrected and true posterior distributions. While\ngeneric and applicable to other inverse problems, by means of a seismic imaging\nexample, we show that our correction step improves the robustness of amortized\nvariational inference with respect to changes in number of source experiments,\nnoise variance, and shifts in the prior distribution.

    "abstract": "The presence of high-density objects such as metal implants and dental\nfillings can introduce severely streak-like artifacts in computed tomography\n(CT) images, greatly limiting subsequent diagnosis. Although various deep\nneural networks-based methods have been proposed for metal artifact reduction\n(MAR), they usually suffer from poor performance due to limited exploitation of\nglobal context in the sinogram domain, secondary artifacts introduced in the\nimage domain, and the requirement of precise metal masks. To address these\nissues, this paper explores fast Fourier convolution for MAR in both sinogram\nand image domains, and proposes a Fourier dual-domain network for MAR, termed\nFD-MAR. Specifically, we first propose a Fourier sinogram restoration network,\nwhich can leverage sinogram-wide receptive context to fill in the\nmetal-corrupted region from uncorrupted region and, hence, is robust to the\nmetal trace. Second, we propose a Fourier refinement network in the image\ndomain, which can refine the reconstructed images in a local-to-global manner\nby exploring image-wide context information. As a result, the proposed FD-MAR\ncan explore the sinogram- and image-wide receptive fields for MAR. By\noptimizing FD-MAR with a composite loss function, extensive experimental\nresults demonstrate the superiority of the proposed FD-MAR over the\nstate-of-the-art MAR methods in terms of quantitative metrics and visual\ncomparison.

Unlike most\nexisting semi-supervised learning methods, adversarial training based methods\ndistinguish samples from different sources by learning the data distribution of\nthe segmentation map, leading the segmenter to generate more accurate\npredictions. We argue that the current performance restrictions for such\napproaches are the problems of feature extraction and learning preference. In\nthis paper, we propose a new semi-supervised adversarial method called Patch\nConfidence Adversarial Training (PCA) for medical image segmentation. Rather\nthan single scalar classification results or pixel-level confidence maps, our\nproposed discriminator creates patch confidence maps and classifies them at the\nscale of the patches. The prediction of unlabeled data learns the pixel\nstructure and context information in each patch to get enough gradient\nfeedback, which aids the discriminator in convergent to an optimal state and\nimproves semi-supervised segmentation performance. Furthermore, at the\ndiscriminator's input, we supplement semantic information constraints on\nimages, making it simpler for unlabeled data to fit the expected data\ndistribution. Extensive experiments on the Automated Cardiac Diagnosis\nChallenge (ACDC) 2017 dataset and the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) 2019\nchallenge dataset show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art\nsemi-supervised methods, which demonstrates its effectiveness for medical image\nsegmentation.",

    "abstract": "Distributed phased array (DPA) is made up of separate antenna nodes that\ncoordinate with each other to perform a coherent operation. Frequency and phase\nsynchronization is a major challenge in DPA for which a Kalman filtering based\ndecentralized frequency and phase consensus (KF-DFPC) algorithm was proposed in\nprior work. In the KF-DFPC algorithm, the nodes share their frequencies and\nphases with their neighbors to reach synchronization. One limitation of the\nDFPC-based algorithms is that, due to relying on the average consensus protocol\nwhich requires undirected networks, they do not converge for directed networks.\nSince directed networks can be more easily implemented in practice, we propose\nin this paper a push-sum based frequency and phase consensus\n($\\text{P}_\\text{s}$FPC) algorithm which converges for such networks. The\nresidual phase error of $\\text{P}_\\text{s}$FPC upon convergence is\ntheoretically derived in this work. Kalman filtering is also integrated with\n$\\text{P}_\\text{s}$FPC and the resulting KF-$\\text{P}_\\text{s}$FPC algorithm\nfurther reduces the residual phase error upon convergence.

In this paper, we propose a novel\nSparse-based domain Adaptation Super-Resolution network (SASR) for the\nreconstruction of realistic 6x6 mm2/low-resolution (LR) OCTA images to\nhigh-resolution (HR) representations. To be more specific, we first perform a\nsimple degradation of the 3x3 mm2/high-resolution (HR) image to obtain the\nsynthetic LR image. An efficient registration method is then employed to\nregister the synthetic LR with its corresponding 3x3 mm2 image region within\nthe 6x6 mm2 image to obtain the cropped realistic LR image. We then propose a\nmulti-level super-resolution model for the fully-supervised reconstruction of\nthe synthetic data, guiding the reconstruction of the realistic LR images\nthrough a generative-adversarial strategy that allows the synthetic and\nrealistic LR images to be unified in the feature domain. Finally, a novel\nsparse edge-aware loss is designed to dynamically optimize the vessel edge\nstructure.

    "abstract": "We propose a novel framework for target speech extraction based on semantic\ninformation, called ConceptBeam. Target speech extraction means extracting the\nspeech of a target speaker in a mixture. Typical approaches have been\nexploiting properties of audio signals, such as harmonic structure and\ndirection of arrival. In contrast, ConceptBeam tackles the problem with\nsemantic clues. Specifically, we extract the speech of speakers speaking about\na concept, i.e., a topic of interest, using a concept specifier such as an\nimage or speech. Solving this novel problem would open the door to innovative\napplications such as listening systems that focus on a particular topic\ndiscussed in a conversation. Unlike keywords, concepts are abstract notions,\nmaking it challenging to directly represent a target concept. In our scheme, a\nconcept is encoded as a semantic embedding by mapping the concept specifier to\na shared embedding space. This modality-independent space can be built by means\nof deep metric learning using paired data consisting of images and their spoken\ncaptions. We use it to bridge modality-dependent information, i.e., the speech\nsegments in the mixture, and the specified, modality-independent concept. As a\nproof of our scheme, we performed experiments using a set of images associated\nwith spoken captions. That is, we generated speech mixtures from these spoken\ncaptions and used the images or speech signals as the concept specifiers. We\nthen extracted the target speech using the acoustic characteristics of the\nidentified segments. We compare ConceptBeam with two methods: one based on\nkeywords obtained from recognition systems and another based on sound source\nseparation. We show that ConceptBeam clearly outperforms the baseline methods\nand effectively extracts speech based on the semantic representation.",

Epidemic spread is a nonlinear process,\noften modeled as the law of mass action, which is of a quadratic form; thus, on\na compact domain, its Lipschitz constant turns out to be local and relatively\nlarge, which renders the Lipschitz-based design criteria of existing observer\narchitectures infeasible. In this paper, a novel observer architecture is\nproposed for the state estimation of a class of nonlinear systems that\nencompasses the deterministic epidemic models. The proposed observer offers\nextra leverage to reduce the influence of nonlinearity in the estimation error\ndynamics, which is not possible in other Luenberger-like observers. Algebraic\nRiccati inequalities are derived as sufficient conditions for the asymptotic\nconvergence of the estimation error to zero under local Lipschitz and\ngeneralized Lipschitz assumptions. Equivalent linear matrix inequality\nformulations of the algebraic Riccati inequalities are also provided.

In particular, the Plug-and-Play (PnP) framework is a popular and\npowerful tool that can integrate an off-the-shelf deep denoiser for different\nimage restoration tasks with known observation models. However, obtaining the\nobservation model that exactly matches the actual one can be challenging in\npractice.

We\nargue that the robustness of the PnP framework is largely limited by using the\noff-the-shelf deep denoisers that are trained by deterministic optimization. To\nthis end, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based PnP\nframework, dubbed RePNP, by leveraging a light-weight DRL-based denoiser for\nrobust image restoration tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed RePNP is robust to the observation model used in the PnP scheme\ndeviating from the actual one.

Boolean networks have\nemerged as a successful class of models for capturing the behavior of GRNs.

In the literature, for simplicity, label uncertainty modeling is\ncommonly approached with a Gaussian assumption on the collected annotations.\nHowever, as the number of annotators is typically rather small due to resource\nconstraints, we argue that the Gaussian approach is a rather crude assumption.\nIn contrast, in this work we propose to model the label distribution using a\nStudent's t-distribution which allows us to account for the number of\nannotations available.

    "title": "Towards Fairness-Aware Multi-Objective Optimization",
    "abstract": "Recent years have seen the rapid development of fairness-aware machine\nlearning in mitigating unfairness or discrimination in decision-making in a\nwide range of applications. However, much less attention has been paid to the\nfairness-aware multi-objective optimization, which is indeed commonly seen in\nreal life, such as fair resource allocation problems and data driven\nmulti-objective optimization problems. This paper aims to illuminate and\nbroaden our understanding of multi-objective optimization from the perspective\nof fairness. To this end, we start with a discussion of user preferences in\nmulti-objective optimization and then explore its relationship to fairness in\nmachine learning and multi-objective optimization. Following the above\ndiscussions, representative cases of fairness-aware multiobjective optimization\nare presented, further elaborating the importance of fairness in traditional\nmulti-objective optimization, data-driven optimization and federated\noptimization. Finally, challenges and opportunities in fairness-aware\nmulti-objective optimization are addressed. We hope that this article makes a\nsmall step forward towards understanding fairness in the context of\noptimization and promote research interest in fairness-aware multi-objective\noptimization.",

    "abstract": "Gene set collections are a common ground to study the enrichment of genes for\nspecific phenotypic traits. Gene set enrichment analysis aims to identify genes\nthat are over-represented in gene sets collections and might be associated with\na specific phenotypic trait. However, as this involves a massive number of\nhypothesis testing, it is often questionable whether a pre-processing step to\nreduce gene sets collections' sizes is helpful. Moreover, the often highly\noverlapping gene sets and the consequent low interpretability of gene sets'\ncollections demand for a reduction of the included gene sets. Inspired by this\nbioinformatics context, we propose a method to rank sets within a family of\nsets based on the distribution of the singletons and their size. We obtain\nsets' importance scores by computing Shapley values without incurring into the\nusual exponential number of evaluations of the value function. Moreover, we\naddress the challenge of including a redundancy awareness in the rankings\nobtained where, in our case, sets are redundant if they show prominent\nintersections. We finally evaluate our approach for gene sets collections; the\nrankings obtained show low redundancy and high coverage of the genes. The\nunsupervised nature of the proposed ranking does not allow for an evident\nincrease in the number of significant gene sets for specific phenotypic traits\nwhen reducing the size of the collections. However, we believe that the\nrankings proposed are of use in bioinformatics to increase interpretability of\nthe gene sets collections and a step forward to include redundancy into Shapley\nvalues computations.",

Focusing on the Italian context, we examine almost\nall the online information produced in the 2016-2021 timeframe by both sources\nthat have a reputation for misinformation and those that do not. Although\nreliable sources can rely on larger newsrooms and cover more news than\nmisinformation ones, the transfer entropy analysis of the corresponding time\nseries reveals that the former have not always informationally dominated the\nlatter on the vaccine subject. Indeed, the pre-pandemic period sees\nmisinformation establish itself as leader of the process, even in causal terms,\nand gain dramatically more user engagement than news from reliable sources.\nDespite this information gap was filled during the Covid-19 outbreak, the\nnewfound leading role of reliable sources as drivers of the information\necosystem has only partially had a beneficial effect in reducing user\nengagement with misinformation on vaccines. Our results indeed show that,\nexcept for effectiveness of vaccination, reliable sources have never adequately\ncountered the anti-vax narrative, specially in the pre-pandemic period, thus\ncontributing to exacerbate science denial and belief in conspiracy theories. At\nthe same time, however, they confirm the efficacy of assiduously proposing a\nconvincing counter-narrative to misinformation spread. Indeed, effectiveness of\nvaccination turns out to be the least engaging topic discussed by\nmisinformation during the pandemic period, when compared to other polarising\narguments such as safety concerns, legal issues and vaccine business. By\nhighlighting the strengths and weaknesses of institutional and mainstream\ncommunication, our findings can be a valuable asset for improving and better\ntargeting campaigns against misinformation on vaccines.",

Starting with the data\npoints being represented by a Markov process using the diffusion map framework,\nthe method adaptively increase the orthogonality of the clusters by applying a\nfeedback mechanism inspired by the Gromov-Wasserstein distance. This mechanism\niteratively increases the spectral gap and refines the orthogonality of the\ndata to achieve a clustering with high specificity. By using the diffusion map\nframework and representing the relation between data points using transition\nprobabilities, the method is robust with respect to both the underlying\ndistance, noise in the data and random initialization. We prove that the method\nconverges globally to a unique fixpoint for certain parameter values. We also\npropose a related approach where the transition probabilities in the Markov\nprocess are required to be doubly stochastic, in which case the method\ngenerates a minimizer to a nonconvex optimization problem. We apply the method\non cryo-electron microscopy image data from biopharmaceutical manufacturing\nwhere we can confirm biologically relevant insights related to therapeutic\nefficacy.

However, in practice,\ntuning these algorithms is typically done using heuristics and trial-and-error\nrather than rigorous, generalizable theory. To address this gap between theory\nand practice, we novel insights into the effect of tuning parameters by\ncharacterizing the large-sample behavior of iterates of a very general class of\npreconditioned stochastic gradient algorithms with fixed step size. In the\noptimization setting, our results show that iterate averaging with a large\nfixed step size can result in statistically efficient approximation of the\n(local) M-estimator. In the sampling context, our results show that with\nappropriate choices of tuning parameters, the limiting stationary covariance\ncan match either the Bernstein--von Mises limit of the posterior, adjustments\nto the posterior for model misspecification, or the asymptotic distribution of\nthe MLE; and that with a naive tuning the limit corresponds to none of these.\nMoreover, we argue that an essentially independent sample from the stationary\ndistribution can be obtained after a fixed number of passes over the dataset.\nWe validate our asymptotic results in realistic finite-sample regimes via\nseveral experiments using simulated and real data.
