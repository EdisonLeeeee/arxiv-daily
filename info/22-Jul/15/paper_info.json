    "title": "Changepoint Detection for Real-Time Spectrum Sharing Radar",
    "abstract": "Radar must adapt to changing environments, and we propose changepoint\ndetection as a method to do so. In the world of increasingly congested radio\nfrequencies, radars must adapt to avoid interference. Many radar systems employ\nthe prediction action cycle to proactively determine transmission mode while\nspectrum sharing. This method constructs and implements a model of the\nenvironment to predict unused frequencies, and then transmits in this predicted\navailability. For these selection strategies, performance is directly reliant\non the quality of the underlying environmental models. In order to keep up with\na changing environment, these models can employ changepoint detection.\nChangepoint detection is the identification of sudden changes, or changepoints,\nin the distribution from which data is drawn. This information allows the\nmodels to discard \"garbage\" data from a previous distribution, which has no\nrelation to the current state of the environment. In this work, bayesian online\nchangepoint detection (BOCD) is applied to the sense and predict algorithm to\nincrease the accuracy of its models and improve its performance. In the context\nof spectrum sharing, these changepoints represent interferers leaving and\nentering the spectral environment. The addition of changepoint detection allows\nfor dynamic and robust spectrum sharing even as interference patterns change\ndramatically. BOCD is especially advantageous because it enables online\nchangepoint detection, allowing models to be updated continuously as data are\ncollected. This strategy can also be applied to many other predictive\nalgorithms that create models in a changing environment.",

However, research on other\ntransportation information systems has shown that informing only a subset of\ndrivers of road conditions may have a perverse effect of increasing congestion.\nIn the context of a simple (yet novel) model of V2V hazard information sharing,\nwe ask whether partial adoption of this technology can similarly lead to\nundesirable outcomes. In our model, drivers individually choose how recklessly\nto behave as a function of information received from other V2V-enabled cars,\nand the resulting aggregate behavior influences the likelihood of accidents\n(and thus the information propagated by the vehicular network). We fully\ncharacterize the game-theoretic equilibria of this model using our new\nequilibrium concept.

    "abstract": "Analog/mixed-signal circuit design is one of the most complex and\ntime-consuming stages in the whole chip design process. Due to various process,\nvoltage, and temperature (PVT) variations from chip manufacturing, analog\ncircuits inevitably suffer from performance degradation. Although there has\nbeen plenty of work on automating analog circuit design under the typical\ncondition, limited research has been done on exploring robust designs under\nreal and unpredictable silicon variations. Automatic analog design against\nvariations requires prohibitive computation and time costs. To address the\nchallenge, we present RobustAnalog, a robust circuit design framework that\ninvolves the variation information in the optimization process. Specifically,\ncircuit optimizations under different variations are considered as a set of\ntasks. Similarities among tasks are leveraged and competitions are alleviated\nto realize a sample-efficient multi-task training. Moreover, RobustAnalog\nprunes the task space according to the current performance in each iteration,\nleading to a further simulation cost reduction. In this way, RobustAnalog can\nrapidly produce a set of circuit parameters that satisfies diverse constraints\n(e.g. gain, bandwidth, noise...) across variations. We compare RobustAnalog\nwith Bayesian optimization, Evolutionary algorithm, and Deep Deterministic\nPolicy Gradient (DDPG) and demonstrate that RobustAnalog can significantly\nreduce required optimization time by 14-30 times.

EHR patient journey data consists of\npatient time-ordered clinical events/visits from patients. Most existing\nstudies focus on modeling long-term dependencies between visits, without\nexplicitly taking short-term correlations between consecutive visits into\naccount, where irregular time intervals, incorporated as auxiliary information,\nare fed into health prediction models to capture latent progressive patterns of\npatient journeys. We present a novel deep neural network with four modules to\ntake into account the contributions of various variables for health prediction:\ni) the Stacked Attention module strengthens the deep semantics in clinical\nevents within each patient journey and generates visit embeddings, ii) the\nShort-Term Temporal Attention module models short-term correlations between\nconsecutive visit embeddings while capturing the impact of time intervals\nwithin those visit embeddings, iii) the Long-Term Temporal Attention module\nmodels long-term dependencies between visit embeddings while capturing the\nimpact of time intervals within those visit embeddings, iv) and finally, the\nCoupled Attention module adaptively aggregates the outputs of Short-Term\nTemporal Attention and Long-Term Temporal Attention modules to make health\npredictions. Experimental results on MIMIC-III demonstrate superior predictive\naccuracy of our model compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, as well as\nthe interpretability and robustness of this approach.

Given the black box nature of artificial\nintelligence (AI) models, caution should be exercised in applying models to\nhealthcare as prediction tasks might be short-cut by differences in\ndemographics across disease and patient populations. Using large\nechocardiography datasets from two healthcare systems, we test whether it is\npossible to predict age, race, and sex from cardiac ultrasound images using\ndeep learning algorithms and assess the impact of varying confounding\nvariables. We trained video-based convolutional neural networks to predict age,\nsex, and race. We found that deep learning models were able to identify age and\nsex, while unable to reliably predict race. Without considering confounding\ndifferences between categories, the AI model predicted sex with an AUC of 0.85\n(95% CI 0.84 - 0.86), age with a mean absolute error of 9.12 years (95% CI 9.00\n- 9.25), and race with AUCs ranging from 0.63 - 0.71. When predicting race, we\nshow that tuning the proportion of a confounding variable (sex) in the training\ndata significantly impacts model AUC (ranging from 0.57 to 0.84), while in\ntraining a sex prediction model, tuning a confounder (race) did not\nsubstantially change AUC (0.81 - 0.83). This suggests a significant proportion\nof the model's performance on predicting race could come from confounding\nfeatures being detected by AI.

Shifts from training data distribution are a\nkey challenge for real-world KWS tasks: when a new model is deployed on device,\nthe gating of the accepted data undergoes a shift in distribution, making the\nproblem of timely updates via subsequent deployments hard. Despite the shift,\nwe assume that the marginal distributions on labels do not change. We utilize a\nmodified teacher/student training framework, where labeled training data is\naugmented with unlabeled data. Note that the teacher does not have access to\nthe new distribution as well. To train effectively with a mix of human and\nteacher labeled data, we develop a teacher labeling strategy based on\nconfidence heuristics to reduce entropy on the label distribution from the\nteacher model; the data is then sampled to match the marginal distribution on\nthe labels.

The model also represents contact interaction via\nunilateral constraints between the beam actuator and e.g. a rigid body during\nthe grasping process of a soft robot. Specifically for the DEA, a work\nconjugated electric displacement and strain-like electric variables are derived\nfor the Cosserat beam. With a mathematically concise and physically\nrepresentative formulation, a reduced free energy function is developed for the\nbeam-DEA. In the optimal control problem, an objective function is minimized\nwhile the dynamic balance equations for the multibody system have to be\nfulfilled together with the complementarity conditions for the contact and\nboundary conditions.

    "abstract": "Digital games are increasingly part of a cyberculture engendered by digital\nplatforms. With this in mind, we approach in this work some considerations\nabout World of Warcraft players as fans and content producers and the narrative\ndisputes that emerge about the game on fan work publishing platforms (Archive\nof Our Own and DeviantArt). We analyzed a vast set of fanfics and fanarts\ncollected on these platforms, showing a textuality that involves not only the\ndigital game, but a whole network of fan production that expands beyond the act\nof playing. Our observations show that, despite the popular perception that\nWorld of Warcraft fandom is mostly male and heteronormative, women and LGBTQI+\npeople are a large participatory audience and produce a lot of content,\nespecially in the fanfic universe. The works created are also quite marked by\nnarratives of dissident bodies and sexualities. However, despite the presence\nof these subjects and narratives in the fandom, this content is made invisible\nin DeviantArt, which privileges male artists and heteronormative fanarts of a\ncommercial nature.",

    "abstract": "Video game developers use game engines as a tool to manage complex aspects of\ngame development. While engines play a big role in the success of games, to the\nbest of our knowledge, they are often developed in isolation, in a\nclosed-source manner, without architectural discussions, comparison, and\ncollaboration among projects. In this work in progress, we compare the call\ngraphs of two open-source engines: Godot 3.4.4 and Urho3D 1.8. While static\nanalysis tools could provide us with a general picture without precise call\ngraph paths, the use of a profiler such as Callgrind allows us to also view the\ncall order and frequency. These graphs give us insight into the engines'\ndesigns. We showed that, by using Callgrind, we can obtain a high-level view of\nan engine's architecture, which can be used to understand it. In future work,\nwe intend to apply both dynamic and static analysis to other open-source\nengines to understand architectural patterns and their impact on aspects such\nas performance and maintenance.",

    "abstract": "Inverter-interfaced microgrids results in challenges when designing\nprotection systems. Traditional time-overcurrent, admittance, and differential\nprotection methods are unsuitable on account of lack of fault current,\nexcessively short lines, or a prohibitive number of protective devices needing\nto be installed. Current practice is to force all inverters to shut down during\nfault conditions, weakening resilience and reducing reliability. Dynamic state\nestimation (DSE), which has been explored for both line protection and load bus\nprotection before, is a potential solution to these challenges to create widely\nutilizable, highly reliable protection systems. However, it has only been\ntested for load protection with ideal voltage sources, which do not capture the\nshort-circuit behavior of inverter-interfaced generation, notably low fault\ncurrent and unbalanced output voltage. This paper aims to extend the\nstate-of-the-art on DSE load protection: the performance of DSE during\nshort-circuit conditions with a grid-forming inverter with current-limiting\nbehavior during fault conditions is investigated.",

    "abstract": "Performance of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications depends highly on the\nemployed scheduling approach. While centralized network schedulers offer high\nV2V communication reliability, their operation is conventionally restricted to\nareas with full cellular network coverage. In contrast, in\nout-of-cellular-coverage areas, comparatively inefficient distributed radio\nresource management is used. To exploit the benefits of the centralized\napproach for enhancing the reliability of V2V communications on roads lacking\ncellular coverage, we propose VRLS (Vehicular Reinforcement Learning\nScheduler), a centralized scheduler that proactively assigns resources for\nout-of-coverage V2V communications \\textit{before} vehicles leave the cellular\nnetwork coverage. By training in simulated vehicular environments, VRLS can\nlearn a scheduling policy that is robust and adaptable to environmental\nchanges, thus eliminating the need for targeted (re-)training in complex\nreal-life environments. We evaluate the performance of VRLS under varying\nmobility, network load, wireless channel, and resource configurations. VRLS\noutperforms the state-of-the-art distributed scheduling algorithm in zones\nwithout cellular network coverage by reducing the packet error rate by half in\nhighly loaded conditions and achieving near-maximum reliability in low-load\nscenarios.",

    "abstract": "Relying on the premise that the performance of a binary neural network can be\nlargely restored with eliminated quantization error between full-precision\nweight vectors and their corresponding binary vectors, existing works of\nnetwork binarization frequently adopt the idea of model robustness to reach the\naforementioned objective. However, robustness remains to be an ill-defined\nconcept without solid theoretical support. In this work, we introduce the\nLipschitz continuity, a well-defined functional property, as the rigorous\ncriteria to define the model robustness for BNN. We then propose to retain the\nLipschitz continuity as a regularization term to improve the model robustness.\nParticularly, while the popular Lipschitz-involved regularization methods often\ncollapse in BNN due to its extreme sparsity, we design the Retention Matrices\nto approximate spectral norms of the targeted weight matrices, which can be\ndeployed as the approximation for the Lipschitz constant of BNNs without the\nexact Lipschitz constant computation (NP-hard). Our experiments prove that our\nBNN-specific regularization method can effectively strengthen the robustness of\nBNN (testified on ImageNet-C), achieving state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR\nand ImageNet.",

    "abstract": "Continual learning requires incremental compatibility with a sequence of\ntasks. However, the design of model architecture remains an open question: In\ngeneral, learning all tasks with a shared set of parameters suffers from severe\ninterference between tasks; while learning each task with a dedicated parameter\nsubspace is limited by scalability. In this work, we theoretically analyze the\ngeneralization errors for learning plasticity and memory stability in continual\nlearning, which can be uniformly upper-bounded by (1) discrepancy between task\ndistributions, (2) flatness of loss landscape and (3) cover of parameter space.\nThen, inspired by the robust biological learning system that processes\nsequential experiences with multiple parallel compartments, we propose\nCooperation of Small Continual Learners (CoSCL) as a general strategy for\ncontinual learning. Specifically, we present an architecture with a fixed\nnumber of narrower sub-networks to learn all incremental tasks in parallel,\nwhich can naturally reduce the two errors through improving the three\ncomponents of the upper bound. To strengthen this advantage, we encourage to\ncooperate these sub-networks by penalizing the difference of predictions made\nby their feature representations. With a fixed parameter budget, CoSCL can\nimprove a variety of representative continual learning approaches by a large\nmargin (e.g., up to 10.64% on CIFAR-100-SC, 9.33% on CIFAR-100-RS, 11.45% on\nCUB-200-2011 and 6.72% on Tiny-ImageNet) and achieve the new state-of-the-art\nperformance.",

Prior work approaches this problem by learning disentangled\nrepresentations for each attribute that enables it to manipulate the encoded\nsource attributes to the target attributes.

Thus, the source attribute\ninformation can often be hidden in the disentangled features, leading to\nunwanted image editing effects. In this paper, we propose an Attribute\nInformation Removal and Reconstruction (AIRR) network that prevents such\ninformation hiding by learning how to remove the attribute information\nentirely, creating attribute excluded features, and then learns to directly\ninject the desired attributes in a reconstructed image. We evaluate our\napproach on four diverse datasets with a variety of attributes including\nDeepFashion Synthesis, DeepFashion Fine-grained Attribute, CelebA and\nCelebA-HQ, where our model improves attribute manipulation accuracy and top-k\nretrieval rate by 10% on average over prior work.

Such a\nchallenge is more outstanding in multi-agent tasks, as each step of operation\nis more costly requiring communications or shifting or resources. This work\naims to improve data efficiency of multi-agent control by model-based learning.\nWe consider networked systems where agents are cooperative and communicate only\nlocally with their neighbors, and propose the decentralized model-based policy\noptimization framework (DMPO). In our method, each agent learns a dynamic model\nto predict future states and broadcast their predictions by communication, and\nthen the policies are trained under the model rollouts. To alleviate the bias\nof model-generated data, we restrain the model usage for generating myopic\nrollouts, thus reducing the compounding error of model generation. To pertain\nthe independence of policy update, we introduce extended value function and\ntheoretically prove that the resulting policy gradient is a close approximation\nto true policy gradients. We evaluate our algorithm on several benchmarks for\nintelligent transportation systems, which are connected autonomous vehicle\ncontrol tasks (Flow and CACC) and adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC).\nEmpirically results show that our method achieves superior data efficiency and\nmatches the performance of model-free methods using true models.",

Certain interpolating methods, including neural networks, can\nfit noisy training data without catastrophically bad test performance, in\ndefiance of standard intuitions from statistical learning theory. Aiming to\nexplain this, a body of recent work has studied $\\textit{benign overfitting}$,\na phenomenon where some interpolating methods approach Bayes optimality, even\nin the presence of noise. In this work we argue that while benign overfitting\nhas been instructive and fruitful to study, many real interpolating methods\nlike neural networks $\\textit{do not fit benignly}$: modest noise in the\ntraining set causes nonzero (but non-infinite) excess risk at test time,\nimplying these models are neither benign nor catastrophic but rather fall in an\nintermediate regime. We call this intermediate regime $\\textit{tempered\noverfitting}$, and we initiate its systematic study. We first explore this\nphenomenon in the context of kernel (ridge) regression (KR) by obtaining\nconditions on the ridge parameter and kernel eigenspectrum under which KR\nexhibits each of the three behaviors. We find that kernels with powerlaw\nspectra, including Laplace kernels and ReLU neural tangent kernels, exhibit\ntempered overfitting. We then empirically study deep neural networks through\nthe lens of our taxonomy, and find that those trained to interpolation are\ntempered, while those stopped early are benign.

The ability to train policies in simulation enables safe exploration\nand large-scale data collection quickly at low cost. However, prior works in\nsim-to-real transfer of robotic policies typically do not involve any\nhuman-robot interaction because accurately simulating human behavior is an open\nproblem. In this work, our goal is to leverage the power of simulation to train\nrobotic policies that are proficient at interacting with humans upon\ndeployment. But there is a chicken and egg problem -- how do we gather examples\nof a human interacting with a physical robot so as to model human behavior in\nsimulation without already having a robot that is able to interact with a\nhuman? Our proposed method, Iterative-Sim-to-Real (i-S2R), attempts to address\nthis. i-S2R bootstraps from a simple model of human behavior and alternates\nbetween training in simulation and deploying in the real world. In each\niteration, both the human behavior model and the policy are refined. We\nevaluate our method on a real world robotic table tennis setting, where the\nobjective for the robot is to play cooperatively with a human player for as\nlong as possible.

Our core idea is to learn a global\nsegmentation mask of each action instance jointly at the full video length. The\nTAGS model differs significantly from the conventional proposal-based methods\nby focusing on global temporal representation learning to directly detect local\nstart and end points of action instances without proposals. Further, by\nmodeling TAD holistically rather than locally at the individual proposal level,\nTAGS needs a much simpler model architecture with lower computational cost.\nExtensive experiments show that despite its simpler design, TAGS outperforms\nexisting TAD methods, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on two\nbenchmarks.

    "title": "Attention: Not Just Another Dataset for Patch-Correctness Checking",
    "abstract": "Automated Program Repair (APR) techniques have drawn wide attention from both\nacademia and industry. Meanwhile, one main limitation with the current\nstate-of-the-art APR tools is that patches passing all the original tests are\nnot necessarily the correct ones wanted by developers, i.e., the plausible\npatch problem. To date,various Patch-Correctness Checking (PCC) techniques have\nbeen proposed to address this important issue. However, they are only evaluated\non very limited datasets as the APR tools used for generating such patches can\nonly explore a small subset of the search space of possible patches, posing\nserious threats to external validity to existing PCC studies. In this paper, we\nconstruct an extensive PCC dataset (the largest labeled PCC dataset to our\nknowledge) to revisit all state-of-the-art PCC techniques. More specifically,\nour PCC dataset includes 1,988 patches generated from the recent PraPR APR\ntool, which leverages highly-optimized bytecode-level patch executions and can\nexhaustively explore all possible plausible patches within its large predefined\nsearch space (including wellknown fixing patterns from various prior APR\ntools). Our extensive study of representative PCC techniques on the new dataset\nhas revealed various surprising findings, including: 1) the assumption made by\nexisting static PCC techniques that correct patches are more similar to buggy\ncode than incorrect plausible patches no longer holds, 2) state-of-the-art\nlearning-based techniques tend to suffer from the dataset overfitting problem,\nand 3) while dynamic techniques overall retain their effectiveness on our new\ndataset, their performance drops substantially on patches with more complicated\nchanges. Based on our findings, we also provide various guidelines/suggestions\nfor advancing PCC in the near future.",

    "abstract": "Automatic processing of language is becoming pervasive in our lives, often\ntaking central roles in our decision making, like choosing the wording for our\nmessages and mails, translating our readings, or even having full conversations\nwith us. Word embeddings are a key component of modern natural language\nprocessing systems. They provide a representation of words that has boosted the\nperformance of many applications, working as a semblance of meaning. Word\nembeddings seem to capture a semblance of the meaning of words from raw text,\nbut, at the same time, they also distill stereotypes and societal biases which\nare subsequently relayed to the final applications. Such biases can be\ndiscriminatory. It is very important to detect and mitigate those biases, to\nprevent discriminatory behaviors of automated processes, which can be much more\nharmful than in the case of humans because their of their scale. There are\ncurrently many tools and techniques to detect and mitigate biases in word\nembeddings, but they present many barriers for the engagement of people without\ntechnical skills. As it happens, most of the experts in bias, either social\nscientists or people with deep knowledge of the context where bias is harmful,\ndo not have such skills, and they cannot engage in the processes of bias\ndetection because of the technical barriers. We have studied the barriers in\nexisting tools and have explored their possibilities and limitations with\ndifferent kinds of users. With this exploration, we propose to develop a tool\nthat is specially aimed to lower the technical barriers and provide the\nexploration power to address the requirements of experts, scientists and people\nin general who are willing to audit these technologies.",

    "abstract": "Current object detectors typically have a feature pyramid (FP) module for\nmulti-level feature fusion (MFF) which aims to mitigate the gap between\nfeatures from different levels and form a comprehensive object representation\nto achieve better detection performance. However, they usually require heavy\ncross-level connections or iterative refinement to obtain better MFF result,\nmaking them complicated in structure and inefficient in computation. To address\nthese issues, we propose a novel and efficient context modeling mechanism that\ncan help existing FPs deliver better MFF results while reducing the\ncomputational costs effectively. In particular, we introduce a novel insight\nthat comprehensive contexts can be decomposed and condensed into two types of\nrepresentations for higher efficiency. The two representations include a\nlocally concentrated representation and a globally summarized representation,\nwhere the former focuses on extracting context cues from nearby areas while the\nlatter extracts key representations of the whole image scene as global context\ncues. By collecting the condensed contexts, we employ a Transformer decoder to\ninvestigate the relations between them and each local feature from the FP and\nthen refine the MFF results accordingly. As a result, we obtain a simple and\nlight-weight Transformer-based Context Condensation (TCC) module, which can\nboost various FPs and lower their computational costs simultaneously. Extensive\nexperimental results on the challenging MS COCO dataset show that TCC is\ncompatible to four representative FPs and consistently improves their detection\naccuracy by up to 7.8 % in terms of average precision and reduce their\ncomplexities by up to around 20% in terms of GFLOPs, helping them achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance more efficiently.

In this paper, we propose a new perspective that regards the SISR as a\nsemantic image detail enhancement problem to generate semantically reasonable\nHR image that are faithful to the ground truth. To enhance the semantic\naccuracy and the visual quality of the reconstructed image, we explore the\nmulti-modal fusion learning in SISR by proposing a Text-Guided Super-Resolution\n(TGSR) framework, which can effectively utilize the information from the text\nand image modalities.

    "abstract": "Complex networks are common in physics, biology, computer science, and social\nscience. Quantifying the relations between complex networks paves the way for\nunderstanding the latent information shared across networks. However,\nfundamental metrics of relations, such as information divergence, mutual\ninformation, Fisher information, and causality, are not well-defined between\ncomplex networks. As a compromise, commonly used strategies (e.g., network\nembedding, matching, and kernel approaches) measure network relations in\ndata-driven ways. These approaches are computation-oriented and inapplicable to\nanalytic derivations in mathematics and physics. To resolve these issues, we\npresent a theory to derive an optimal characterization of network topological\nproperties. Our theory shows that a complex network can be fully represented by\na Gaussian Markov random field defined by the discrete Schr\\\"{o}dinger\noperator, which simultaneously satisfies desired smoothness and maximum entropy\nproperties. Based on this characterization, we can analytically measure diverse\nrelations between networks in terms of topology properties. As illustrations,\nwe primarily show how to define encoding (e.g., information divergence and\nmutual information), decoding (e.g., Fisher information), and causality (e.g.,\ntransfer entropy and Granger causality) between complex networks. We validate\nour framework on representative complex networks (e.g., evolutionary random\nnetwork models, protein-protein interaction network, and chemical compound\nnetworks), and demonstrate that a series of science and engineering challenges\n(e.g., network evolution, clustering, and classification) can be tackled from a\nnew perspective.

    "abstract": "While the abuse of deepfake technology has caused serious concerns recently,\nhow to detect deepfake videos is still a challenge due to the high\nphoto-realistic synthesis of each frame. Existing image-level approaches often\nfocus on single frame and ignore the spatiotemporal cues hidden in deepfake\nvideos, resulting in poor generalization and robustness. The key of a\nvideo-level detector is to fully exploit the spatiotemporal inconsistency\ndistributed in local facial regions across different frames in deepfake videos.\nInspired by that, this paper proposes a simple yet effective patch-level\napproach to facilitate deepfake video detection via spatiotemporal dropout\ntransformer. The approach reorganizes each input video into bag of patches that\nis then fed into a vision transformer to achieve robust representation.\nSpecifically, a spatiotemporal dropout operation is proposed to fully explore\npatch-level spatiotemporal cues and serve as effective data augmentation to\nfurther enhance model's robustness and generalization ability. The operation is\nflexible and can be easily plugged into existing vision transformers.

However, the\ncapabilities of tinyML are restricted by strict power and compute constraints.\nThe majority of the contemporary research in tinyML focuses on model\ncompression techniques such as model pruning and quantization to fit ML models\non low-end devices. Nevertheless, the improvements in energy consumption and\ninference time obtained by existing techniques are limited because aggressive\ncompression quickly shrinks model capacity and accuracy. Another approach to\nimprove inference time and/or reduce power while preserving its model capacity\nis through early-exit networks. These networks place intermediate classifiers\nalong a baseline neural network that facilitate early exit from neural network\ncomputation if an intermediate classifier exhibits sufficient confidence in its\nprediction. Previous work on early-exit networks have focused on large\nnetworks, beyond what would typically be used for tinyML applications.

In addition, we develop a method to alleviate the effect of network\noverthinking at the final exit by leveraging the high-level representations\nlearned by the early-exit. We evaluate T-RECX on three CNNs from the MLPerf\ntiny benchmark suite for image classification, keyword spotting and visual wake\nword detection tasks.

    "abstract": "A covert attack method often used by APT organizations is the DNS tunnel,\nwhich is used to pass information by constructing C2 networks. And they often\nuse the method of frequently changing domain names and server IP addresses to\nevade monitoring, which makes it extremely difficult to detect them. However,\nthey carry DNS tunnel information traffic in normal DNS communication, which\ninevitably brings anomalies in some statistical characteristics of DNS traffic,\nso that it would provide security personnel with the opportunity to find them.\nBased on the above considerations, this paper studies the statistical discovery\nmethodology of typical DNS tunnel high-frequency query behavior. Firstly, we\nanalyze the distribution of the DNS domain name length and times and finds that\nthe DNS domain name length and times follow the normal distribution law.\nSecondly, based on this distribution law, we propose a method for detecting and\ndiscovering high-frequency DNS query behaviors of non-single domain names based\non the statistical rules of domain name length and frequency and we also give\nthree theorems as theoretical support. Thirdly, we design a sliding window\ndifference scheme based on the above method. Experimental results show that our\nmethod has a higher detection rate. At the same time, since our method does not\nneed to construct a data set, it has better practicability in detecting unknown\nDNS tunnels. This also shows that our detection method based on mathematical\nmodels can effectively avoid the dilemma for machine learning methods that must\nhave useful training data sets, and has strong practical significance.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based source dehazing methods trained on synthetic datasets\nhave achieved remarkable performance but suffer from dramatic performance\ndegradation on real hazy images due to domain shift. Although certain Domain\nAdaptation (DA) dehazing methods have been presented, they inevitably require\naccess to the source dataset to reduce the gap between the source synthetic and\ntarget real domains. To address these issues, we present a novel Source-Free\nUnsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA) image dehazing paradigm, in which only a\nwell-trained source model and an unlabeled target real hazy dataset are\navailable. Specifically, we devise the Domain Representation Normalization\n(DRN) module to make the representation of real hazy domain features match that\nof the synthetic domain to bridge the gaps. With our plug-and-play DRN module,\nunlabeled real hazy images can adapt existing well-trained source networks.\nBesides, the unsupervised losses are applied to guide the learning of the DRN\nmodule, which consists of frequency losses and physical prior losses. Frequency\nlosses provide structure and style constraints, while the prior loss explores\nthe inherent statistic property of haze-free images. Equipped with our DRN\nmodule and unsupervised loss, existing source dehazing models are able to\ndehaze unlabeled real hazy images. Extensive experiments on multiple baselines\ndemonstrate the validity and superiority of our method visually and\nquantitatively.",

Numerous approaches have been proposed to construct a\nrepresentation for the user in order to find similar items for retrieval tasks,\nand they have been proven effective in industrial recommendation systems as\nwell. Recently people have discovered the power of using multiple embeddings to\nrepresent a user, with the hope that each embedding represents the user's\ninterest in a certain topic. With multi-interest representation, it's important\nto model the user's preference over the different topics and how the preference\nchange with time.

Development of Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) solutions\nis therefore challenging, necessitating a diverse dataset to serve as a\ncollection of examples. However, a comprehensive dataset of Indian scenario is\nmissing, thereby, hampering the progress towards publicly available and\nreproducible ANPR solutions. Many countries have invested efforts to develop\ncomprehensive ANPR datasets like Chinese City Parking Dataset (CCPD) for China\nand Application-oriented License Plate (AOLP) dataset for US. In this work, we\nrelease an expanding dataset presently consisting of 1.5k images and a scalable\nand reproducible procedure of enhancing this dataset towards development of\nANPR solution for Indian conditions. We have leveraged this dataset to explore\nan End-to-End (E2E) ANPR architecture for Indian scenario which was originally\nproposed for Chinese Vehicle number-plate recognition based on the CCPD\ndataset. As we customized the architecture for our dataset, we came across\ninsights, which we have discussed in this paper. We report the hindrances in\ndirect reusability of the model provided by the authors of CCPD because of the\nextreme diversity in Indian number plates and differences in distribution with\nrespect to the CCPD dataset. An improvement of 42.86% was observed in LP\ndetection after aligning the characteristics of Indian dataset with Chinese\ndataset. In this work, we have also compared the performance of the E2E\nnumber-plate detection model with YOLOv5 model, pre-trained on COCO dataset and\nfine-tuned on Indian vehicle images.

    "abstract": "With video-level labels, weakly supervised temporal action localization\n(WTAL) applies a localization-by-classification paradigm to detect and classify\nthe action in untrimmed videos. Due to the characteristic of classification,\nclass-specific background snippets are inevitably mis-activated to improve the\ndiscriminability of the classifier in WTAL. To alleviate the disturbance of\nbackground, existing methods try to enlarge the discrepancy between action and\nbackground through modeling background snippets with pseudo-snippet-level\nannotations, which largely rely on artificial hypotheticals. Distinct from the\nprevious works, we present an adversarial learning strategy to break the\nlimitation of mining pseudo background snippets. Concretely, the background\nclassification loss forces the whole video to be regarded as the background by\na background gradient reinforcement strategy, confusing the recognition model.\nReversely, the foreground(action) loss guides the model to focus on action\nsnippets under such conditions. As a result, competition between the two\nclassification losses drives the model to boost its ability for action\nmodeling. Simultaneously, a novel temporal enhancement network is designed to\nfacilitate the model to construct temporal relation of affinity snippets based\non the proposed strategy, for further improving the performance of action\nlocalization.

    "abstract": "Traditional algorithms of point set registration minimizing point-to-plane\ndistances often achieve a better estimation of rigid transformation than those\nminimizing point-to-point distances. Nevertheless, recent deep-learning-based\nmethods minimize the point-to-point distances. In contrast to these methods,\nthis paper proposes the first deep-learning-based approach to point-to-plane\nregistration. A challenging part of this problem is that a typical solution for\npoint-to-plane registration requires an iterative process of accumulating small\ntransformations obtained by minimizing a linearized energy function. The\niteration significantly increases the size of the computation graph needed for\nbackpropagation and can slow down both forward and backward network\nevaluations. To solve this problem, we consider the estimated rigid\ntransformation as a function of input point clouds and derive its analytic\ngradients using the implicit function theorem. The analytic gradient that we\nintroduce is independent of how the error minimizing function (i.e., the rigid\ntransformation) is obtained, thus allowing us to calculate both the rigid\ntransformation and its gradient efficiently. We implement the proposed\npoint-to-plane registration module over several previous methods that minimize\npoint-to-point distances and demonstrate that the extensions outperform the\nbase methods even with point clouds with noise and low-quality point normals\nestimated with local point distributions.",

These HTs can\ncompromise the integrity, deteriorate the performance, deny the service, and\nalter the functionality of the design. While numerous HT detection methods have\nbeen proposed in the literature, the crucial task of HT localization is\noverlooked. Moreover, a few existing HT localization methods have several\nweaknesses: reliance on a golden reference, inability to generalize for all\ntypes of HT, lack of scalability, low localization resolution, and manual\nfeature engineering/property definition. To overcome their shortcomings, we\npropose a novel, golden reference-free HT localization method at the\npre-silicon stage by leveraging Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). In this\nwork, we convert the circuit design to its intrinsic data structure, graph and\nextract the node attributes. Afterward, the graph convolution performs\nautomatic feature extraction for nodes to classify the nodes as Trojan or\nbenign.

Recent research focuses on developing techniques to\nautomatically detect API misuses, but many suffer from a high false-positive\nrate. In this article, we improve on this situation by proposing ChaRLI (Change\nRuLe Inference), a technique for automatically inferring change rules from\ndevelopers' fixes of API misuses based on API Usage Graphs (AUGs). By\nsubsequently applying graph-distance algorithms, we use change rules to\ndiscriminate API misuses from correct usages. This allows developers to reuse\nothers' fixes of an API misuse at other code locations in the same or another\nproject. We evaluated the ability of change rules to detect API misuses based\non three datasets and found that the best mean relative precision (i.e., for\ntestable usages) ranges from 77.1 % to 96.1 % while the mean recall ranges from\n0.007 % to 17.7 % for individual change rules.

    "abstract": "Although more layers and more parameters generally improve the accuracy of\nthe models, such big models generally have high computational complexity and\nrequire big memory, which exceed the capacity of small devices for inference\nand incurs long training time. In addition, it is difficult to afford long\ntraining time and inference time of big models even in high performance\nservers, as well. As an efficient approach to compress a large deep model (a\nteacher model) to a compact model (a student model), knowledge distillation\nemerges as a promising approach to deal with the big models. Existing knowledge\ndistillation methods cannot exploit the elastic available computing resources\nand correspond to low efficiency. In this paper, we propose an Elastic Deep\nLearning framework for knowledge Distillation, i.e., EDL-Dist. The advantages\nof EDL-Dist are three-fold. First, the inference and the training process is\nseparated. Second, elastic available computing resources can be utilized to\nimprove the efficiency. Third, fault-tolerance of the training and inference\nprocesses is supported. We take extensive experimentation to show that the\nthroughput of EDL-Dist is up to 3.125 times faster than the baseline method\n(online knowledge distillation) while the accuracy is similar or higher.",

    "abstract": "End-to-end (E2E) models are becoming increasingly popular for spoken language\nunderstanding (SLU) systems and are beginning to achieve competitive\nperformance to pipeline-based approaches. However, recent work has shown that\nthese models struggle to generalize to new phrasings for the same intent\nindicating that models cannot understand the semantic content of the given\nutterance. In this work, we incorporated language models pre-trained on\nunlabeled text data inside E2E-SLU frameworks to build strong semantic\nrepresentations. Incorporating both semantic and acoustic information can\nincrease the inference time, leading to high latency when deployed for\napplications like voice assistants. We developed a 2-pass SLU system that makes\nlow latency prediction using acoustic information from the few seconds of the\naudio in the first pass and makes higher quality prediction in the second pass\nby combining semantic and acoustic representations. We take inspiration from\nprior work on 2-pass end-to-end speech recognition systems that attends on both\naudio and first-pass hypothesis using a deliberation network. The proposed\n2-pass SLU system outperforms the acoustic-based SLU model on the Fluent Speech\nCommands Challenge Set and SLURP dataset and reduces latency, thus improving\nuser experience.

    "abstract": "The cotton boll weevil, Anthonomus grandis Boheman is a serious pest to the\nU.S. cotton industry that has cost more than 16 billion USD in damages since it\nentered the United States from Mexico in the late 1800s. This pest has been\nnearly eradicated; however, southern part of Texas still faces this issue and\nis always prone to the pest reinfestation each year due to its sub-tropical\nclimate where cotton plants can grow year-round. Volunteer cotton (VC) plants\ngrowing in the fields of inter-seasonal crops, like corn, can serve as hosts to\nthese pests once they reach pin-head square stage (5-6 leaf stage) and\ntherefore need to be detected, located, and destroyed or sprayed . In this\npaper, we present a study to detect VC plants in a corn field using YOLOv3 on\nthree band aerial images collected by unmanned aircraft system (UAS). The\ntwo-fold objectives of this paper were : (i) to determine whether YOLOv3 can be\nused for VC detection in a corn field using RGB (red, green, and blue) aerial\nimages collected by UAS and (ii) to investigate the behavior of YOLOv3 on\nimages at three different scales (320 x 320, S1; 416 x 416, S2; and 512 x 512,\nS3 pixels) based on average precision (AP), mean average precision (mAP) and\nF1-score at 95% confidence level. No significant differences existed for mAP\namong the three scales, while a significant difference was found for AP between\nS1 and S3 (p = 0.04) and S2 and S3 (p = 0.02). A significant difference was\nalso found for F1-score between S2 and S3 (p = 0.02). The lack of significant\ndifferences of mAP at all the three scales indicated that the trained YOLOv3\nmodel can be used on a computer vision-based remotely piloted aerial\napplication system (RPAAS) for VC detection and spray application in near\nreal-time.",

Existing counterfactual explainable approaches face huge search\nspace and their explanations are either action-based (e.g., user click) or\naspect-based (i.e., item description). We believe item attribute-based\nexplanations are more intuitive and persuadable for users since they explain by\nfine-grained item demographic features (e.g., brand).

    "abstract": "Blockchains are maintained by a network of participants that run algorithms\ndesigned to maintain collectively a distributed machine tolerant to Byzantine\nattacks. From the point of view of users, blockchains provide the illusion of\ncentralized computers that perform trustable verifiable computations, where all\ncomputations are deterministic and the results cannot be manipulated or undone.\nSmart-contracts are written in a special-purpose programming language with\ndeterministic semantics. Each transaction begins with an invocation from an\nexternal user to a smart contract. Contracts have local storage and can call\nother contracts, and more importantly, they store, send and receive\ncryptocurrency. It is very important to guarantee that contracts are correct\nbefore deployment since their code cannot be modified afterward deployment.\nHowever, the resulting ecosystem makes it very difficult to reason about\nprogram correctness, since contracts can be executed by malicious users or\nmalicious contracts can be designed to exploit other contracts that call them.\nMany attacks and bugs are caused by unexpected interactions between multiple\ncontracts, the attacked contract and unknown code that performs the exploit.\nMoreover, there is a very aggressive competition between different blockchains\nto expand their user base. Ideas are implemented fast and blockchains compete\nto offer and adopt new features quickly. In this paper, we propose a formal\nextensible playground that allows reasoning about multi-contract interactions\nto ultimately prove properties before features are incorporated into the real\nblockchain.

The proposed model\ninvolves the implementation of the AD (Artificial Dust) by the intruder,\nfollowed by the execution of the HD (Half-Duplex) attack. The communication\nnetwork is based on the deployment of urban and rural scenarios with an unknown\nCSI (Channel State Information). Depending on the achieved path loss based on\nthe distance of the user from the BS, the user with the highest path loss is\nparticularized for the attack. The formulation of AD divulges the increased\nsusceptibilities of the secure network specifically for the selected legitimate\nuser. The parameter of visibility defines the amount of AD present in the\ncommunication channel. Based on the enumerated attenuation created by the\nartificial dust, the parameter of secrecy rate is evaluated with varying\ndistance of the user from the BS and the operating frequency. Furthermore, the\nproposed scheme of the HD attack is initiated by the intruder at the specified\nvalid user. The strategy of the attack focuses on the continuous monitor of the\nuplink and attempts the spoofing attack on the downlink wherein the allocation\nof the resources takes place. The efficacy of the proposed approach is\ncorroborated through the examination of simulation results.

    "abstract": "End-to-end text spotting has attached great attention recently due to its\nbenefits on global optimization and high maintainability for real applications.\nHowever, the input scale has always been a tough trade-off since recognizing a\nsmall text instance usually requires enlarging the whole image, which brings\nhigh computational costs. In this paper, to address this problem, we propose a\nnovel cost-efficient Dynamic Low-resolution Distillation (DLD) text spotting\nframework, which aims to infer images in different small but recognizable\nresolutions and achieve a better balance between accuracy and efficiency.\nConcretely, we adopt a resolution selector to dynamically decide the input\nresolutions for different images, which is constraint by both inference\naccuracy and computational cost. Another sequential knowledge distillation\nstrategy is conducted on the text recognition branch, making the low-res input\nobtains comparable performance to a high-res image. The proposed method can be\noptimized end-to-end and adopted in any current text spotting framework to\nimprove the practicability. Extensive experiments on several text spotting\nbenchmarks show that the proposed method vastly improves the usability of\nlow-res models.

    "abstract": "This paper presents the outcomes of a contest organized to evaluate methods\nfor the online recognition of heterogeneous gestures from sequences of 3D hand\nposes. The task is the detection of gestures belonging to a dictionary of 16\nclasses characterized by different pose and motion features. The dataset\nfeatures continuous sequences of hand tracking data where the gestures are\ninterleaved with non-significant motions. The data have been captured using the\nHololens 2 finger tracking system in a realistic use-case of mixed reality\ninteraction. The evaluation is based not only on the detection performances but\nalso on the latency and the false positives, making it possible to understand\nthe feasibility of practical interaction tools based on the algorithms\nproposed. The outcomes of the contest's evaluation demonstrate the necessity of\nfurther research to reduce recognition errors, while the computational cost of\nthe algorithms proposed is sufficiently low.",

    "abstract": "Constraint linear-time temporal logic (CLTL) is an extension of LTL that is\ninterpreted on sequences of valuations of variables over an infinite domain.\nThe atomic formulas are interpreted as constraints on the valuations. The\natomic formulas can constrain valuations over a range of positions along a\nsequence, with the range being bounded by a parameter depending on the formula.\nThe satisfiability and model checking problems for CLTL have been studied by\nDemri and D'Souza. We consider the realizability problem for CLTL. The set of\nvariables is partitioned into two parts, with each part controlled by a player.\nPlayers take turns to choose valuations for their variables, generating a\nsequence of valuations. The winning condition is specified by a CLTL formula --\nthe first player wins if the sequence of valuations satisfies the specified\nformula. We study the decidability of checking whether the first player has a\nwinning strategy in the realizability game for a given CLTL formula. We prove\nthat it is decidable in the case where the domain satisfies the completion\nproperty, a property introduced by Balbiani and Condotta in the context of\nsatisfiability. We prove that it is undecidable over $(\\mathbb{Z},<,=)$, the\ndomain of integers with order and equality. We prove that over\n$(\\mathbb{Z},<,=)$, it is decidable if the atomic constraints in the formula\ncan only constrain the current valuations of variables belonging to the second\nplayer, but there are no such restrictions for the variables belonging to the\nfirst player.

The importance of automatic detection\nof threatening and abusive language can not be overestimated. However, most of\nthe existing studies and state-of-the-art methods focus on English as the\ntarget language, with limited work on low- and medium-resource languages. In\nthis paper, we present two shared tasks of abusive and threatening language\ndetection for the Urdu language which has more than 170 million speakers\nworldwide. Both are posed as binary classification tasks where participating\nsystems are required to classify tweets in Urdu into two classes, namely: (i)\nAbusive and Non-Abusive for the first task, and (ii) Threatening and\nNon-Threatening for the second. We present two manually annotated datasets\ncontaining tweets labelled as (i) Abusive and Non-Abusive, and (ii) Threatening\nand Non-Threatening. The abusive dataset contains 2400 annotated tweets in the\ntrain part and 1100 annotated tweets in the test part. The threatening dataset\ncontains 6000 annotated tweets in the train part and 3950 annotated tweets in\nthe test part. We also provide logistic regression and BERT-based baseline\nclassifiers for both tasks. In this shared task, 21 teams from six countries\nregistered for participation (India, Pakistan, China, Malaysia, United Arab\nEmirates, and Taiwan), 10 teams submitted their runs for Subtask A, which is\nAbusive Language Detection and 9 teams submitted their runs for Subtask B,\nwhich is Threatening Language detection, and seven teams submitted their\ntechnical reports.

In this paper these ill-conditioning\nissues and subsequent instabilities affecting the application of the RBF-FD\nmethod in presence of Neumann BCs are analyzed both theoretically and\nnumerically. The theoretical motivations for the onset of such issues are\nderived by highlighting the dependence of the determinant of the local\ninterpolation matrix upon the boundary normals. Qualitative investigations are\nalso carried out numerically by studying a reference stencil and looking for\ncorrelations between its geometry and the properties of the associated\ninterpolation matrix.

In the context of\nbag of words visual SLAM, vector quantization (VQ) is considered as the most\ntime-consuming part of the SLAM procedure, which is usually performed in the\noffline phase of the SLAM algorithm using unsupervised algorithms such as\nKmeans++. We have addressed the loop closure detection part of the BoW-based\nSLAM methods in a self-supervised manner, by integrating an autoencoder for\ndoing vector quantization. This approach can increase the accuracy of\nlarge-scale SLAM, where plenty of unlabeled data is available. The main\nadvantage of using a self-supervised is that it can help reducing the amount of\nlabeling.

While verification is known to be\ncomputationally difficult theoretically, many techniques have been proposed for\nsolving it in practice.

Because for training purposes these functions\nneed to be differentiable, these translations are called differentiable logics\n(DL). This raises several research questions.

    "abstract": "Recently, automatically extracting information from visually rich documents\n(e.g., tickets and resumes) has become a hot and vital research topic due to\nits widespread commercial value. Most existing methods divide this task into\ntwo subparts: the text reading part for obtaining the plain text from the\noriginal document images and the information extraction part for extracting key\ncontents. These methods mainly focus on improving the second, while neglecting\nthat the two parts are highly correlated. This paper proposes a unified\nend-to-end information extraction framework from visually rich documents, where\ntext reading and information extraction can reinforce each other via a\nwell-designed multi-modal context block. Specifically, the text reading part\nprovides multi-modal features like visual, textual and layout features. The\nmulti-modal context block is developed to fuse the generated multi-modal\nfeatures and even the prior knowledge from the pre-trained language model for\nbetter semantic representation. The information extraction part is responsible\nfor generating key contents with the fused context features. The framework can\nbe trained in an end-to-end trainable manner, achieving global optimization.\nWhat is more, we define and group visually rich documents into four categories\nacross two dimensions, the layout and text type. For each document category, we\nprovide or recommend the corresponding benchmarks, experimental settings and\nstrong baselines for remedying the problem that this research area lacks the\nuniform evaluation standard.

In this paper, we propose an\nend-to-end trainable adaptively expandable network named E2-AEN, which\ndynamically generates lightweight structures for new tasks without any accuracy\ndrop in previous tasks. Specifically, the network contains a serial of powerful\nfeature adapters for augmenting the previously learned representations to new\ntasks, and avoiding task interference.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we put forward secure network function computation over a\ndirected acyclic network. In such a network, a sink node is required to compute\nwith zero error a target function of which the inputs are generated as source\nmessages at multiple source nodes, while a wiretapper, who can access any one\nbut not more than one wiretap set in a given collection of wiretap sets, is not\nallowed to obtain any information about a security function of the source\nmessages. The secure computing capacity for the above model is defined as the\nmaximum average number of times that the target function can be securely\ncomputed with zero error at the sink node with the given collection of wiretap\nsets and security function for one use of the network. The characterization of\nthis capacity is in general overwhelmingly difficult. In the current paper, we\nconsider securely computing linear functions with a wiretapper who can\neavesdrop any subset of edges up to a certain size r, referred to as the\nsecurity level, with the security function being the identity function. We\nfirst prove an upper bound on the secure computing capacity, which is\napplicable to arbitrary network topologies and arbitrary security levels. When\nthe security level r is equal to 0, our upper bound reduces to the computing\ncapacity without security consideration. We discover the surprising fact that\nfor some models, there is no penalty on the secure computing capacity compared\nwith the computing capacity without security consideration. We further obtain\nan equivalent expression of the upper bound by using a graph-theoretic\napproach, and accordingly we develop an efficient approach for computing this\nbound. Furthermore, we present a construction of linear function-computing\nsecure network codes and obtain a lower bound on the secure computing capacity.",

However, most existing methods cannot handle small objects or large\nmotion well, especially in high-resolution videos such as 4K videos. To\neliminate such limitations, we introduce a neighbor correspondence matching\n(NCM) algorithm for flow-based frame synthesis. Since the current frame is not\navailable in video frame synthesis, NCM is performed in a\ncurrent-frame-agnostic fashion to establish multi-scale correspondences in the\nspatial-temporal neighborhoods of each pixel. Based on the powerful motion\nrepresentation capability of NCM, we further propose to estimate intermediate\nflows for frame synthesis in a heterogeneous coarse-to-fine scheme.\nSpecifically, the coarse-scale module is designed to leverage neighbor\ncorrespondences to capture large motion, while the fine-scale module is more\ncomputationally efficient to speed up the estimation process. Both modules are\ntrained progressively to eliminate the resolution gap between training dataset\nand real-world videos. Experimental results show that NCM achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks.

The problem starts from formulating and non-dimensionalising a\nFluid-Solid Interaction (FSI) problem using Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE)\ntechnique at the pore level. The resultant ALE-FSI coupled systems of PDEs are\nexpanded and analysed using the asymptotic homogenisation technique which\nyields three partially novel systems of PDEs, one governing the\nmacroscopic/effective problem supplied by two microscale problems (fluid and\nsolid).

This is possible efficiently by training an Artificial Neural Network\n(ANN) as a surrogate for the Direct Numerical Solution (DNS) of the microscale\nsolid problem. The present methodology allows to solve finite strain\n(multiscale) porohyperelastic problems accurately using direct derivative of\nthe strain energy, for the first time.

    "abstract": "Microservice architecture is the common choice for cloud applications these\ndays since each individual microservice can be independently modified,\nreplaced, and scaled. However, the complexity of microservice applications\nrequires automated testing with a focus on the interactions between the\nservices. While this is achievable with end-to-end tests, they are error-prone,\nbrittle, expensive to write, time-consuming to run, and require the entire\napplication to be deployed. Integration tests are an alternative to end-to-end\ntests since they have a smaller test scope and require the deployment of a\nsignificantly fewer number of services. The de-facto standard for deploying\nmicroservice applications in the cloud is containers with Kubernetes being the\nmost widely used container orchestration platform. To support the integration\ntesting of microservices in Kubernetes, several tools such as Octopus, Istio,\nand Jenkins exist. However, each of these tools either lack crucial\nfunctionality or lead to a substantial increase in the complexity and growth of\nthe tool landscape when introduced into a project. To this end, we present\n\\emph{Bunk8s}, a tool for integration testing of microservice applications in\nKubernetes that overcomes the limitations of these existing tools.\n\\emph{Bunk8s} is independent of the test framework used for writing integration\ntests, independent of the used CI/CD infrastructure, and supports test result\npublishing.

    "abstract": "Most existing few-shot learning (FSL) methods require a large amount of\nlabeled data in meta-training, which is a major limit. To reduce the\nrequirement of labels, a semi-supervised meta-training setting has been\nproposed for FSL, which includes only a few labeled samples and numbers of\nunlabeled samples in base classes. However, existing methods under this setting\nrequire class-aware sample selection from the unlabeled set, which violates the\nassumption of unlabeled set. In this paper, we propose a practical\nsemi-supervised meta-training setting with truly unlabeled data. Under the new\nsetting, the performance of existing methods drops notably. To better utilize\nboth the labeled and truly unlabeled data, we propose a simple and effective\nmeta-training framework, called pseudo-labeling based on meta-learning (PLML).\nFirstly, we train a classifier via common semi-supervised learning (SSL) and\nuse it to obtain the pseudo-labels of unlabeled data. Then we build few-shot\ntasks from labeled and pseudo-labeled data and run meta-learning over the\nconstructed tasks to learn the FSL model. Surprisingly, through extensive\nexperiments across two FSL datasets, we find that this simple meta-training\nframework effectively prevents the performance degradation of FSL under limited\nlabeled data. Besides, benefiting from meta-training, the proposed method\nimproves the classifiers learned by two representative SSL algorithms as well.",

Therefore, an\nefficient and interpretable automatic PD diagnosis system is valuable for\nsupporting clinicians with more robust diagnostic decision-making. To this end,\nwe propose to classify Parkinson's tremor since it is one of the most\npredominant symptoms of PD with strong generalizability. Different from other\ncomputer-aided time and resource-consuming Parkinson's Tremor (PT)\nclassification systems that rely on wearable sensors, we propose SPAPNet, which\nonly requires consumer-grade non-intrusive video recording of camera-facing\nhuman movements as input to provide undiagnosed patients with low-cost PT\nclassification results as a PD warning sign.

    "abstract": "Many biological and medical tasks require the delineation of 3D curvilinear\nstructures such as blood vessels and neurites from image volumes. This is\ntypically done using neural networks trained by minimizing voxel-wise loss\nfunctions that do not capture the topological properties of these structures.\nAs a result, the connectivity of the recovered structures is often wrong, which\nlessens their usefulness. In this paper, we propose to improve the 3D\nconnectivity of our results by minimizing a sum of topology-aware losses on\ntheir 2D projections.

    "abstract": "Business analytics and machine learning have become essential success factors\nfor various industries - with the downside of cost-intensive gathering and\nlabeling of data. Few-shot learning addresses this challenge and reduces data\ngathering and labeling costs by learning novel classes with very few labeled\ndata. In this paper, we design a human-in-the-loop (HITL) system for few-shot\nlearning and analyze an extensive range of mechanisms that can be used to\nacquire human expert knowledge for instances that have an uncertain prediction\noutcome. We show that the acquisition of human expert knowledge significantly\naccelerates the few-shot model performance given a negligible labeling effort.\nWe validate our findings in various experiments on a benchmark dataset in\ncomputer vision and real-world datasets. We further demonstrate the\ncost-effectiveness of HITL systems for few-shot learning.

    "abstract": "Today, intelligent user interfaces on the web often come in form of\nrecommendation services tailoring content to individual users. Recommendation\nof web content such as news articles often requires a certain amount of\nexplicit ratings to allow for satisfactory results, i.e., the selection of\ncontent actually relevant for the user. Yet, the collection of such explicit\nratings is time-consuming and dependent on users' willingness to provide the\nrequired information on a regular basis. Thus, using implicit interest\nindicators can be a helpful complementation to relying on explicitly entered\ninformation only. Analysis of reading behavior on the web can be the basis for\nthe derivation of such implicit indicators. Previous work has already\nidentified several indicators and discussed how they can be used as a basis for\nuser models. However, most earlier work is either of conceptual nature and does\nnot involve studies to prove the suggested concepts or relies on meanwhile\npotentially outdated technology. All earlier discussions of the topic further\nhave in common that they do not yet consider mobile contexts. This paper builds\nupon earlier work, however providing a major update regarding technology and\nweb reading context, distinguishing between desktop and mobile settings. This\nupdate also allowed us to identify a set of new indicators that so far have not\nyet been discussed. This paper describes (i) our technical work, a framework\nfor analyzing user interactions with the browser relying on latest web\ntechnologies, (ii) the implicit interest indicators we either revisited or\nnewly identified, and (iii) the results of an online study on web reading\nbehavior as a basis for derivation of interest we conducted with 96\nparticipants.",

To address these two issues,\nwe have designed an instance-level human parsing network which is anchor-free\nand solvable on a pixel level. It consists of two simple sub-networks: an\nanchor-free detection head for bounding box predictions and an edge-guided\nparsing head for human segmentation. The anchor-free detector head inherits the\npixel-like merits and effectively avoids the sensitivity of hyper-parameters as\nproved in object detection applications. By introducing the part-aware boundary\nclue, the edge-guided parsing head is capable to distinguish adjacent human\nparts from among each other up to 58 parts in a single human instance, even\noverlapping instances. Meanwhile, a refinement head integrating box-level score\nand part-level parsing quality is exploited to improve the quality of the\nparsing results. Experiments on two multiple human parsing datasets (i.e., CIHP\nand LV-MHP-v2.0) and one video instance-level human parsing dataset (i.e., VIP)\nshow that our method achieves the best global-level and instance-level\nperformance over state-of-the-art one-stage top-down alternatives.",

Since the parameters of SSL\nmodels are generally so large that training and inference require a lot of\nmemory and computational cost, it is desirable to produce compact SSL models\nwithout a significant performance degradation by applying compression methods\nsuch as knowledge distillation (KD). Although the KD approach is able to shrink\nthe depth and/or width of SSL model structures, there has been little research\non how varying the depth and width impacts the internal representation of the\nsmall-footprint model. This paper provides an empirical study that addresses\nthe question. We investigate the performance on SUPERB while varying the\nstructure and KD methods so as to keep the number of parameters constant; this\nallows us to analyze the contribution of the representation introduced by\nvarying the model architecture. Experiments demonstrate that a certain depth is\nessential for solving content-oriented tasks (e.g. automatic speech\nrecognition) accurately, whereas a certain width is necessary for achieving\nhigh performance on several speaker-oriented tasks (e.g. speaker\nidentification). Based on these observations, we identify, for SUPERB, a more\ncompressed model with better performance than previous studies.",

While Bayesian deep learning techniques allow uncertainty estimation,\ntraining them with large-scale datasets is an expensive process that does not\nalways yield models competitive with non-Bayesian counterparts. Moreover, many\nof the high-performing deep learning models that are already trained and\ndeployed are non-Bayesian in nature and do not provide uncertainty estimates.\nTo address these issues, we propose BayesCap that learns a Bayesian identity\nmapping for the frozen model, allowing uncertainty estimation.

We experimentally demonstrate a 3-layer\nDNN with our architecture using a simple hardware setup assembled with\ncommercial components. Additionally, this is the first DNN hardware accelerator\nsuitable for analog inference of temporal waveforms like voice or radio\nsignals, achieving bandwidth-limited throughput and speed-of-light limited\nlatency. Our results demonstrate a highly scalable ONN with a straightforward\npath to surpassing the current computing bottleneck, in addition to enabling\nnew possibilities for high-performance analog deep learning of temporal\nwaveforms.",

    "abstract": "The manifold hypothesis (real world data concentrates near low-dimensional\nmanifolds) is suggested as the principle behind the effectiveness of machine\nlearning algorithms in very high dimensional problems that are common in\ndomains such as vision and speech. Multiple methods have been proposed to\nexplicitly incorporate the manifold hypothesis as a prior in modern Deep Neural\nNetworks (DNNs), with varying success. In this paper, we propose a new method,\nDistance Learner, to incorporate this prior for DNN-based classifiers. Distance\nLearner is trained to predict the distance of a point from the underlying\nmanifold of each class, rather than the class label. For classification,\nDistance Learner then chooses the class corresponding to the closest predicted\nclass manifold. Distance Learner can also identify points as being out of\ndistribution (belonging to neither class), if the distance to the closest\nmanifold is higher than a threshold. We evaluate our method on multiple\nsynthetic datasets and show that Distance Learner learns much more meaningful\nclassification boundaries compared to a standard classifier. We also evaluate\nour method on the task of adversarial robustness, and find that it not only\noutperforms standard classifier by a large margin, but also performs at par\nwith classifiers trained via state-of-the-art adversarial training.",

    "abstract": "Binary neural network (BNN) provides a promising solution to deploy\nparameter-intensive deep single image super-resolution (SISR) models onto real\ndevices with limited storage and computational resources. To achieve comparable\nperformance with the full-precision counterpart, most existing BNNs for SISR\nmainly focus on compensating the information loss incurred by binarizing\nweights and activations in the network through better approximations to the\nbinarized convolution. In this study, we revisit the difference between BNNs\nand their full-precision counterparts and argue that the key for good\ngeneralization performance of BNNs lies on preserving a complete full-precision\ninformation flow as well as an accurate gradient flow passing through each\nbinarized convolution layer. Inspired by this, we propose to introduce a\nfull-precision skip connection or its variant over each binarized convolution\nlayer across the entire network, which can increase the forward expressive\ncapability and the accuracy of back-propagated gradient, thus enhancing the\ngeneralization performance. More importantly, such a scheme is applicable to\nany existing BNN backbones for SISR without introducing any additional\ncomputation cost. To testify its efficacy, we evaluate it using four different\nbackbones for SISR on four benchmark datasets and report obviously superior\nperformance over existing BNNs and even some 4-bit competitors.",

Moreover, to\nenhance photo-realism when extrapolating tourist photographs, we propose a\nnovel realism augmentation process to complement appearance details, which\nautomatically propagates the texture details from a narrow captured photo to\nthe extrapolated neural rendered image.

This presents a challenge for\nlearning-based waveform selection approaches, since transmission policies which\nare effective in one scene may be highly suboptimal in another.

In this work, we develop an online meta-learning approach for\nwaveform-agile tracking. This approach uses information gained from previous\ntarget tracks to speed up and enhance learning in new tracking instances. This\nresults in sample-efficient learning across a class of finite state target\nchannels by exploiting inherent similarity across tracking scenes, attributed\nto common physical elements such as target type or clutter. We formulate the\nonline waveform selection problem in the framework of Bayesian learning, and\nprovide prior-dependent performance bounds for the meta-learning problem using\nPAC-Bayes theory.

The equation is usually approximated using a\nstochastic interacting $P$-particle system, a set of $P$ coupled\n$d$-dimensional stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Importance sampling\n(IS) is a common technique to reduce high relative variance of Monte Carlo\nestimators of rare event probabilities. In the SDE context, optimal measure\nchange is derived using stochastic optimal control theory to minimize estimator\nvariance, which when applied to stochastic particle systems yields a $P \\times\nd$-dimensional partial differential control equation, which is cumbersome to\nsolve.

Real-time denoising algorithms are typically adopted on the user\ndevice to remove the noise involved during the shooting and transmission of\nvideo streams.

Recent multi-output\ninference works propagate the bidirectional temporal feature with a parallel or\nrecurrent framework, which either suffers from performance drops on the\ntemporal edges of clips or can not achieve online inference. In this paper, we\npropose a Bidirectional Streaming Video Denoising (BSVD) framework, to achieve\nhigh-fidelity real-time denoising for streaming videos with both past and\nfuture temporal receptive fields. The bidirectional temporal fusion for online\ninference is considered not applicable in the MoViNet.

    "title": "Shared perception is different from individual perception: a new look on  context dependency",
    "abstract": "Human perception is based on unconscious inference, where sensory input\nintegrates with prior information. This phenomenon, known as context\ndependency, helps in facing the uncertainty of the external world with\npredictions built upon previous experience. On the other hand, human perceptual\nprocesses are inherently shaped by social interactions. However, how the\nmechanisms of context dependency are affected is to date unknown. If using\nprevious experience - priors - is beneficial in individual settings, it could\nrepresent a problem in social scenarios where other agents might not have the\nsame priors, causing a perceptual misalignment on the shared environment. The\npresent study addresses this question. We studied context dependency in an\ninteractive setting with a humanoid robot iCub that acted as a stimuli\ndemonstrator. Participants reproduced the lengths shown by the robot in two\nconditions: one with iCub behaving socially and another with iCub acting as a\nmechanical arm. The different behavior of the robot significantly affected the\nuse of prior in perception. Moreover, the social robot positively impacted\nperceptual performances by enhancing accuracy and reducing participants overall\nperceptual errors. Finally, the observed phenomenon has been modelled following\na Bayesian approach to deepen and explore a new concept of shared perception.",

    "abstract": "Demystifying the delay propagation mechanisms among multiple airports is\nfundamental to precise and interpretable delay prediction, which is crucial\nduring decision-making for all aviation industry stakeholders. The principal\nchallenge lies in effectively leveraging the spatiotemporal dependencies and\nexogenous factors related to the delay propagation. However, previous works\nonly consider limited spatiotemporal patterns with few factors. To promote more\ncomprehensive propagation modeling for delay prediction, we propose\nSpatioTemporal Propagation Network (STPN), a space-time separable graph\nconvolutional network, which is novel in spatiotemporal dependency capturing.\nFrom the aspect of spatial relation modeling, we propose a multi-graph\nconvolution model considering both geographic proximity and airline schedule.\nFrom the aspect of temporal dependency capturing, we propose a multi-head\nself-attentional mechanism that can be learned end-to-end and explicitly reason\nmultiple kinds of temporal dependency of delay time series. We show that the\njoint spatial and temporal learning models yield a sum of the Kronecker\nproduct, which factors the spatiotemporal dependence into the sum of several\nspatial and temporal adjacency matrices. By this means, STPN allows cross-talk\nof spatial and temporal factors for modeling delay propagation. Furthermore, a\nsqueeze and excitation module is added to each layer of STPN to boost\nmeaningful spatiotemporal features. To this end, we apply STPN to multi-step\nahead arrival and departure delay prediction in large-scale airport networks.\nTo validate the effectiveness of our model, we experiment with two real-world\ndelay datasets, including U.S and China flight delays; and we show that STPN\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "We present ObjectBox, a novel single-stage anchor-free and highly\ngeneralizable object detection approach. As opposed to both existing\nanchor-based and anchor-free detectors, which are more biased toward specific\nobject scales in their label assignments, we use only object center locations\nas positive samples and treat all objects equally in different feature levels\nregardless of the objects' sizes or shapes. Specifically, our label assignment\nstrategy considers the object center locations as shape- and size-agnostic\nanchors in an anchor-free fashion, and allows learning to occur at all scales\nfor every object. To support this, we define new regression targets as the\ndistances from two corners of the center cell location to the four sides of the\nbounding box. Moreover, to handle scale-variant objects, we propose a tailored\nIoU loss to deal with boxes with different sizes.

    "abstract": "The attitude stabilization of a micro-satellite employing a\nvariable-amplitude cold gas thruster which reflects as a time varying gain on\nthe control input is considered. Existing literature uses a persistence filter\nbased approach that typically leads to large control gains and torque inputs\nduring specific time intervals corresponding to the 'on' phase of the external\nactuation. This work aims at reducing the transient spikes placed upon the\ntorque commands by the judicious introduction of an additional time varying\nscaling signal as part of the control law. The time update mechanism for the\nnew scaling factor and overall closed-loop stability are established through a\nLyapunov-like analysis. Numerical simulations highlight the various features of\nthis new control algorithm for spacecraft attitude stabilization subject to\ntorque intermittence.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we mainly focus on the problem of how to learn additional\nfeature representations for few-shot image classification through pretext tasks\n(e.g., rotation or color permutation and so on). This additional knowledge\ngenerated by pretext tasks can further improve the performance of few-shot\nlearning (FSL) as it differs from human-annotated supervision (i.e., class\nlabels of FSL tasks). To solve this problem, we present a plug-in Hierarchical\nTree Structure-aware (HTS) method, which not only learns the relationship of\nFSL and pretext tasks, but more importantly, can adaptively select and\naggregate feature representations generated by pretext tasks to maximize the\nperformance of FSL tasks. A hierarchical tree constructing component and a\ngated selection aggregating component is introduced to construct the tree\nstructure and find richer transferable knowledge that can rapidly adapt to\nnovel classes with a few labeled images. Extensive experiments show that our\nHTS can significantly enhance multiple few-shot methods to achieve new\nstate-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets.

Tackling this bottleneck results in a trade-off between what can be\nrepresented in the embedding matrix and computational issues in the output\nlayer. This paper introduces PIXEL, the Pixel-based Encoder of Language, which\nsuffers from neither of these issues. PIXEL is a pretrained language model that\nrenders text as images, making it possible to transfer representations across\nlanguages based on orthographic similarity or the co-activation of pixels.\nPIXEL is trained to reconstruct the pixels of masked patches, instead of\npredicting a distribution over tokens. We pretrain the 86M parameter PIXEL\nmodel on the same English data as BERT and evaluate on syntactic and semantic\ntasks in typologically diverse languages, including various non-Latin scripts.\nWe find that PIXEL substantially outperforms BERT on syntactic and semantic\nprocessing tasks on scripts that are not found in the pretraining data, but\nPIXEL is slightly weaker than BERT when working with Latin scripts.\nFurthermore, we find that PIXEL is more robust to noisy text inputs than BERT,\nfurther confirming the benefits of modelling language with pixels.",

    "abstract": "Since the seminal PPAD-completeness result for computing a Nash equilibrium\neven in two-player games, an important line of research has focused on\nrelaxations achievable in polynomial time. In this paper, we consider the\nnotion of $\\varepsilon$-well-supported Nash equilibrium, where $\\varepsilon \\in\n[0,1]$ corresponds to the approximation guarantee. Put simply, in an\n$\\varepsilon$-well-supported equilibrium, every player chooses with positive\nprobability actions that are within $\\varepsilon$ of the maximum achievable\npayoff, against the other player's strategy. Ever since the initial\napproximation guarantee of 2/3 for well-supported equilibria, which was\nestablished more than a decade ago, the progress on this problem has been\nextremely slow and incremental. Notably, the small improvements to 0.6608, and\nfinally to 0.6528, were achieved by algorithms of growing complexity. Our main\nresult is a simple and intuitive algorithm, that improves the approximation\nguarantee to 1/2. Our algorithm is based on linear programming and in\nparticular on exploiting suitably defined zero-sum games that arise from the\npayoff matrices of the two players. As a byproduct, we show how to achieve the\nsame approximation guarantee in a query-efficient way.",

    "abstract": "Accurate three-dimensional perception is a fundamental task in several\ncomputer vision applications. Recently, commercial RGB-depth (RGB-D) cameras\nhave been widely adopted as single-view depth-sensing devices owing to their\nefficient depth-sensing abilities. However, the depth quality of most RGB-D\nsensors remains insufficient owing to the inherent noise from a single-view\nenvironment. Recently, several studies have focused on the single-view depth\nenhancement of RGB-D cameras. Recent research has proposed deep-learning-based\napproaches that typically train networks using high-quality supervised depth\ndatasets, which indicates that the quality of the ground-truth (GT) depth\ndataset is a top-most important factor for accurate system; however, such\nhigh-quality GT datasets are difficult to obtain. In this study, we developed a\nnovel method for high-quality GT depth generation based on an RGB-D stream\ndataset. First, we defined consecutive depth frames in a local spatial region\nas a local frame set. Then, the depth frames were aligned to a certain frame in\nthe local frame set using an unsupervised point cloud registration scheme. The\nregistration parameters were trained based on an overfit-training scheme, which\nwas primarily used to construct a single GT depth image for each frame set. The\nfinal GT depth dataset was constructed using several local frame sets, and each\nlocal frame set was trained independently. The primary advantage of this study\nis that a high-quality GT depth dataset can be constructed under various\nscanning environments using only the RGB-D stream dataset. Moreover, our\nproposed method can be used as a new benchmark GT dataset for accurate\nperformance evaluations. We evaluated our GT dataset on previously benchmarked\nGT depth datasets and demonstrated that our method is superior to\nstate-of-the-art depth enhancement frameworks.",

    "abstract": "Adjoint algorithmic differentiation by operator and function overloading is\nbased on the interpretation of directed acyclic graphs resulting from\nevaluations of numerical simulation programs. The size of the computer system\nmemory required to store the graph grows proportional to the number of\nfloating-point operations executed by the underlying program. It quickly\nexceeds the available memory resources. Naive adjoint algorithmic\ndifferentiation often becomes infeasible except for relatively simple numerical\nsimulations.\nAccess to the data associated with the graph can be classified as sequential\nand random. The latter refers to memory access patterns defined by the\nadjacency relationship between vertices within the graph. Sequentially accessed\ndata can be decomposed into blocks. The blocks can be streamed across the\nsystem memory hierarchy thus extending the amount of available memory, for\nexample, to hard discs. Asynchronous i/o can help to mitigate the increased\ncost due to accesses to slower memory. Much larger problem instances can thus\nbe solved without resorting to technically challenging user intervention such\nas checkpointing. Randomly accessed data should not have to be decomposed. Its\nblock-wise streaming is likely to yield a substantial overhead in computational\ncost due to data accesses across blocks. Consequently, the size of the randomly\naccessed memory required by an adjoint should be kept minimal in order to\neliminate the need for decomposition. We propose a combination of dedicated\nmemory for adjoint $L$-values with the exploitation of remainder bandwidth as a\npossible solution. Test results indicate significant savings in random access\nmemory size while preserving overall computational efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Accurate and efficient detection of ovarian cancer at early stages is\ncritical to ensure proper treatments for patients. Among the first-line\nmodalities investigated in studies of early diagnosis are features distilled\nfrom protein mass spectra. This method, however, considers only a specific\nsubset of spectral responses and ignores the interplay among protein expression\nlevels, which can also contain diagnostic information. We propose a new\nmodality that automatically searches protein mass spectra for discriminatory\nfeatures by considering the self-similar nature of the spectra. Self-similarity\nis assessed by taking a wavelet decomposition of protein mass spectra and\nestimating the rate of level-wise decay in the energies of the resulting\nwavelet coefficients. Level-wise energies are estimated in a robust manner\nusing distance variance, and rates are estimated locally via a rolling window\napproach. This results in a collection of rates that can be used to\ncharacterize the interplay among proteins, which can be indicative of cancer\npresence. Discriminatory descriptors are then selected from these evolutionary\nrates and used as classifying features. The proposed wavelet-based features are\nused in conjunction with features proposed in the existing literature for early\nstage diagnosis of ovarian cancer using two datasets published by the American\nNational Cancer Institute. Including the wavelet-based features from the new\nmodality results in improvements in diagnostic performance for early-stage\novarian cancer detection.

As a result, several a-posteriori explanation\nmethods have been proposed to highlight the features that influence a model's\nprediction. Notably, the Shapley value--a game theoretic quantity that\nsatisfies several desirable properties--has gained popularity in the machine\nlearning explainability literature. More traditionally, however, feature\nimportance in statistical learning has been formalized by conditional\nindependence, and a standard way to test for it is via Conditional\nRandomization Tests (CRTs). So far, these two perspectives on interpretability\nand feature importance have been considered distinct and separate. In this\nwork, we show that Shapley-based explanation methods and conditional\nindependence testing for feature importance are closely related. More\nprecisely, we prove that evaluating a Shapley coefficient amounts to performing\na specific set of conditional independence tests, as implemented by a procedure\nsimilar to the CRT but for a different null hypothesis. Furthermore, the\nobtained game-theoretic values upper bound the $p$-values of such tests. As a\nresult, we grant large Shapley coefficients with a precise statistical sense of\nimportance with controlled type I error.",

    "abstract": "The pretrain-then-finetune paradigm has been widely adopted in computer\nvision. But as the size of Vision Transformer (ViT) grows exponentially, the\nfull finetuning becomes prohibitive in view of the heavier storage overhead.\nMotivated by parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) on language\ntransformers, recent studies attempt to insert lightweight adaptation modules\n(e.g., adapter layers or prompt tokens) to pretrained ViT and only finetune\nthese modules while the pretrained weights are frozen. However, these modules\nwere originally proposed to finetune language models. Although ported well to\nViT, their design lacks prior knowledge for visual tasks. In this paper, we\npropose to construct Convolutional Bypasses (Convpass) in ViT as adaptation\nmodules, introducing only a small amount (less than 0.5% of model parameters)\nof trainable parameters to adapt the large ViT. Different from other PETL\nmethods, Convpass benefits from the hard-coded inductive bias of convolutional\nlayers and thus is more suitable for visual tasks, especially in the low-data\nregime. Experimental results on VTAB-1k benchmark and few-shot learning\ndatasets demonstrate that Convpass outperforms current language-oriented\nadaptation modules, demonstrating the necessity to tailor vision-oriented\nadaptation modules for vision models.",

However, there are many\nknown methodological pitfalls, including data leakage, in ML-based science. In\nthis paper, we systematically investigate reproducibility issues in ML-based\nscience. We show that data leakage is indeed a widespread problem and has led\nto severe reproducibility failures. Specifically, through a survey of\nliterature in research communities that adopted ML methods, we find 17 fields\nwhere errors have been found, collectively affecting 329 papers and in some\ncases leading to wildly overoptimistic conclusions. Based on our survey, we\npresent a fine-grained taxonomy of 8 types of leakage that range from textbook\nerrors to open research problems.\nWe argue for fundamental methodological changes to ML-based science so that\ncases of leakage can be caught before publication. To that end, we propose\nmodel info sheets for reporting scientific claims based on ML models that would\naddress all types of leakage identified in our survey. To investigate the\nimpact of reproducibility errors and the efficacy of model info sheets, we\nundertake a reproducibility study in a field where complex ML models are\nbelieved to vastly outperform older statistical models such as Logistic\nRegression (LR): civil war prediction. We find that all papers claiming the\nsuperior performance of complex ML models compared to LR models fail to\nreproduce due to data leakage, and complex ML models don't perform\nsubstantively better than decades-old LR models. While none of these errors\ncould have been caught by reading the papers, model info sheets would enable\nthe detection of leakage in each case.",

    "abstract": "The 6th generation of wireless communication (6G) is envisioned to give rise\nto various technologies for improving the end-to-end communication performance,\nwhere the communication is envisioned to utilize wireless signals in the\nmillimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies and above. Among others, these\ntechnologies comprise Intelligent Reflective Surfaces (IRSs) and Mobile Relays\n(MRs), whose envisaged roles include mitigating the negative effects of\nNon-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) connectivity, in particular at mmWave and higher\nfrequencies. The core idea behind these technologies is to use cooperative\nnetworking where the source sends a signal to a repeater, in this case the IRS\nor the MR, which is upon reception forwarded to the destination. When comparing\nthe two technologies, it is important to realize that the IRSs are primarily\nenvisioned to be static entities attached to various objects in the environment\nsuch as walls and furniture. In contrast, the MRs will feature a higher degree\nof freedom, as they will be able to position themselves seamlessly in the\nenvironment. Based on the above assumptions, we derive an approach for\ndetermining the optimal position of the IRS and MR in indoor environments,\ni.e., the one that maximizes the end-to-end link quality between the source and\nthe destination. We follow by capturing the communication quality indicators\nfor both IRS- and MR-supported NLoS avoidance in indoor mmWave communication in\na number of scenarios. Our results show that, from the end-to-end link quality\nperspective, the MRs generally outperform the IRSs, suggesting their\nutilization potential for throughput-optimized NLoS avoidance scenarios.",

Its main appeal is handling\nrecursive definitions that are not obviously well-founded: as long as the\ncorresponding domain is also defined recursively, and its recursion pattern\nlines up appropriately with the definition of the relations, the framework can\nguarantee their existence. Pitts' original development used the Knaster-Tarski\nfixed-point theorem as a key ingredient. In these notes, I show how his\nconstruction can be seen as an instance of other key fixed-point theorems: the\ninverse limit construction, the Banach fixed-point theorem and the Kleene\nfixed-point theorem. The connection underscores how Pitts' construction is\nintimately tied to the methods for constructing the base recursive domains\nthemselves, and also to techniques based on guarded recursion, or\nstep-indexing, that have become popular in the last two decades.",

    "abstract": "Existing temporal action detection (TAD) methods rely on a large number of\ntraining data with segment-level annotations. Collecting and annotating such a\ntraining set is thus highly expensive and unscalable. Semi-supervised TAD\n(SS-TAD) alleviates this problem by leveraging unlabeled videos freely\navailable at scale. However, SS-TAD is also a much more challenging problem\nthan supervised TAD, and consequently much under-studied. Prior SS-TAD methods\ndirectly combine an existing proposal-based TAD method and a SSL method. Due to\ntheir sequential localization (e.g, proposal generation) and classification\ndesign, they are prone to proposal error propagation. To overcome this\nlimitation, in this work we propose a novel Semi-supervised Temporal action\ndetection model based on PropOsal-free Temporal mask (SPOT) with a parallel\nlocalization (mask generation) and classification architecture. Such a novel\ndesign effectively eliminates the dependence between localization and\nclassification by cutting off the route for error propagation in-between. We\nfurther introduce an interaction mechanism between classification and\nlocalization for prediction refinement, and a new pretext task for\nself-supervised model pre-training. Extensive experiments on two standard\nbenchmarks show that our SPOT outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives, often\nby a large margin.

Generalization captures a model's ability to classify unseen\ndata while invariance measures consistency of model predictions on\ntransformations of the data. Existing research suggests a positive\nrelationship: a model generalizing well should be invariant to certain visual\nfactors. Building on this qualitative implication we make two contributions.\nFirst, we introduce effective invariance (EI), a simple and reasonable measure\nof model invariance which does not rely on image labels. Given predictions on a\ntest image and its transformed version, EI measures how well the predictions\nagree and with what level of confidence. Second, using invariance scores\ncomputed by EI, we perform large-scale quantitative correlation studies between\ngeneralization and invariance, focusing on rotation and grayscale\ntransformations. From a model-centric view, we observe generalization and\ninvariance of different models exhibit a strong linear relationship, on both\nin-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets. From a dataset-centric view,\nwe find a certain model's accuracy and invariance linearly correlated on\ndifferent test sets.

Egocentric\nscene understanding poses unprecedented challenges: (1) due to large head\nmovements, the images are taken from non-canonical viewpoints (i.e., tilted\nimages) where existing models of geometry prediction do not apply; (2) dynamic\nforeground objects including hands constitute a large proportion of visual\nscenes. These challenges limit the performance of the existing models learned\nfrom large indoor datasets, such as ScanNet and NYUv2, which comprise\npredominantly upright images of static scenes. We present a multimodal spatial\nrectifier that stabilizes the egocentric images to a set of reference\ndirections, which allows learning a coherent visual representation. Unlike\nunimodal spatial rectifier that often produces excessive perspective warp for\negocentric images, the multimodal spatial rectifier learns from multiple\ndirections that can minimize the impact of the perspective warp. To learn\nvisual representations of the dynamic foreground objects, we present a new\ndataset called EDINA (Egocentric Depth on everyday INdoor Activities) that\ncomprises more than 500K synchronized RGBD frames and gravity directions.\nEquipped with the multimodal spatial rectifier and the EDINA dataset, our\nproposed method on single-view depth and surface normal estimation\nsignificantly outperforms the baselines not only on our EDINA dataset, but also\non other popular egocentric datasets, such as First Person Hand Action (FPHA)\nand EPIC-KITCHENS.",

    "title": "An Asymmetric Contrastive Loss for Handling Imbalanced Datasets",
    "abstract": "Contrastive learning is a representation learning method performed by\ncontrasting a sample to other similar samples so that they are brought closely\ntogether, forming clusters in the feature space. The learning process is\ntypically conducted using a two-stage training architecture, and it utilizes\nthe contrastive loss (CL) for its feature learning. Contrastive learning has\nbeen shown to be quite successful in handling imbalanced datasets, in which\nsome classes are overrepresented while some others are underrepresented.\nHowever, previous studies have not specifically modified CL for imbalanced\ndatasets. In this work, we introduce an asymmetric version of CL, referred to\nas ACL, in order to directly address the problem of class imbalance. In\naddition, we propose the asymmetric focal contrastive loss (AFCL) as a further\ngeneralization of both ACL and focal contrastive loss (FCL). Results on the\nFMNIST and ISIC 2018 imbalanced datasets show that AFCL is capable of\noutperforming CL and FCL in terms of both weighted and unweighted\nclassification accuracies. In the appendix, we provide a full axiomatic\ntreatment on entropy, along with complete proofs.",

    "abstract": "Prompt tuning attempts to update few task-specific parameters in pre-trained\nmodels. It has achieved comparable performance to fine-tuning of the full\nparameter set on both language understanding and generation tasks. In this\nwork, we study the problem of prompt tuning for neural text retrievers. We\nintroduce parameter-efficient prompt tuning for text retrieval across\nin-domain, cross-domain, and cross-topic settings. Through an extensive\nanalysis, we show that the strategy can mitigate the two issues --\nparameter-inefficiency and weak generalizability -- faced by fine-tuning based\nretrieval methods. Notably, it can significantly improve the out-of-domain\nzero-shot generalization of the retrieval models. By updating only 0.1% of the\nmodel parameters, the prompt tuning strategy can help retrieval models achieve\nbetter generalization performance than traditional methods in which all\nparameters are updated. Finally, to facilitate research on retrievers'\ncross-topic generalizability, we curate and release an academic retrieval\ndataset with 18K query-results pairs in 87 topics, making it the largest\ntopic-specific one to date.",

    "title": "Inverse Resource Rational Based Stochastic Driver Behavior Model",
    "abstract": "Human drivers have limited and time-varying cognitive resources when making\ndecisions in real-world traffic scenarios, which often leads to unique and\nstochastic behaviors that can not be explained by perfect rationality\nassumption, a widely accepted premise in modeling driving behaviors that\npresume drivers rationally make decisions to maximize their own rewards under\nall circumstances. To explicitly address this disadvantage, this study presents\na novel driver behavior model that aims to capture the resource rationality and\nstochasticity of the human driver's behaviors in realistic longitudinal driving\nscenarios. The resource rationality principle can provide a theoretic framework\nto better understand the human cognition processes by modeling human's internal\ncognitive mechanisms as utility maximization subject to cognitive resource\nlimitations, which can be represented as finite and time-varying preview\nhorizons in the context of driving. An inverse resource rational-based\nstochastic inverse reinforcement learning approach (IRR-SIRL) is proposed to\nlearn a distribution of the planning horizon and cost function of the human\ndriver with a given series of human demonstrations. A nonlinear model\npredictive control (NMPC) with a time-varying horizon approach is used to\ngenerate driver-specific trajectories by using the learned distributions of the\nplanning horizon and the cost function of the driver. The simulation\nexperiments are carried out using human demonstrations gathered from the\ndriver-in-the-loop driving simulator. The results reveal that the proposed\ninverse resource rational-based stochastic driver model can address the\nresource rationality and stochasticity of human driving behaviors in a variety\nof realistic longitudinal driving scenarios.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a low-cost and highly accurate ECG-monitoring system\nintended for personalized early arrhythmia detection for wearable mobile\nsensors. Earlier supervised approaches for personalized ECG monitoring require\nboth abnormal and normal heartbeats for the training of the dedicated\nclassifier. However, in a real-world scenario where the personalized algorithm\nis embedded in a wearable device, such training data is not available for\nhealthy people with no cardiac disorder history. In this study, (i) we propose\na null space analysis on the healthy signal space obtained via sparse\ndictionary learning, and investigate how a simple null space projection or\nalternatively regularized least squares-based classification methods can reduce\nthe computational complexity, without sacrificing the detection accuracy, when\ncompared to sparse representation-based classification. (ii) Then we introduce\na sparse representation-based domain adaptation technique in order to project\nother existing users' abnormal and normal signals onto the new user's signal\nspace, enabling us to train the dedicated classifier without having any\nabnormal heartbeat of the new user. Therefore, zero-shot learning can be\nachieved without the need for synthetic abnormal heartbeat generation. An\nextensive set of experiments performed on the benchmark MIT-BIH ECG dataset\nshows that when this domain adaptation-based training data generator is used\nwith a simple 1-D CNN classifier, the method outperforms the prior work by a\nsignificant margin. (iii) Then, by combining (i) and (ii), we propose an\nensemble classifier that further improves the performance. This approach for\nzero-shot arrhythmia detection achieves an average accuracy level of 98.2% and\nan F1-Score of 92.8%. Finally, a personalized energy-efficient ECG monitoring\nscheme is proposed using the above-mentioned innovations.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, image-to-image translation methods, are the state of the art for\nthe enhancement of natural images. Even if they usually show high performance\nin terms of accuracy, they often suffer from several limitations such as the\ngeneration of artifacts and the scalability to high resolutions. Moreover,\ntheir main drawback is the completely black-box approach that does not allow to\nprovide the final user with any insight about the enhancement processes\napplied. In this paper we present a path planning algorithm which provides a\nstep-by-step explanation of the output produced by state of the art enhancement\nmethods, overcoming black-box limitation. This algorithm, called eXIE, uses a\nvariant of the A* algorithm to emulate the enhancement process of another\nmethod through the application of an equivalent sequence of enhancing\noperators. We applied eXIE to explain the output of several state-of-the-art\nmodels trained on the Five-K dataset, obtaining sequences of enhancing\noperators able to produce very similar results in terms of performance and\novercoming the huge limitation of poor interpretability of the best performing\nalgorithms.",

    "abstract": "We consider a fully-connected wireless gossip network which consists of a\nsource and $n$ receiver nodes. The source updates itself with a Poisson process\nand also sends updates to the nodes as Poisson arrivals. Upon receiving the\nupdates, the nodes update their knowledge about the source. The nodes gossip\nthe data among themselves in the form of Poisson arrivals to disperse their\nknowledge about the source. The total gossiping rate is bounded by a\nconstraint. The goal of the network is to be as timely as possible with the\nsource. In this work, we propose ASUMAN, a distributed opportunistic gossiping\nscheme, where after each time the source updates itself, each node waits for a\ntime proportional to its current age and broadcasts a signal to the other nodes\nof the network. This allows the nodes in the network which have higher age to\nremain silent and only the low-age nodes to gossip, thus utilizing a\nsignificant portion of the constrained total gossip rate. We calculate the\naverage age for a typical node in such a network with symmetric settings and\nshow that the theoretical upper bound on the age scales as $O(1)$. ASUMAN, with\nan average age of $O(1)$, offers significant gains compared to a system where\nthe nodes just gossip blindly with a fixed update rate in which case the age\nscales as $O(\\log n)$.",

    "abstract": "This work aims at advancing temporal action detection (TAD) using an\nencoder-decoder framework with action queries, similar to DETR, which has shown\ngreat success in object detection. However, the framework suffers from several\nproblems if directly applied to TAD: the insufficient exploration of\ninter-query relation in the decoder, the inadequate classification training due\nto a limited number of training samples, and the unreliable classification\nscores at inference. To this end, we first propose a relational attention\nmechanism in the decoder, which guides the attention among queries based on\ntheir relations. Moreover, we propose two losses to facilitate and stabilize\nthe training of action classification. Lastly, we propose to predict the\nlocalization quality of each action query at inference in order to distinguish\nhigh-quality queries. The proposed method, named ReAct, achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance on THUMOS14, with much lower computational costs\nthan previous methods.

In this\nwork, we propose a principled framework, Relighting4D, that enables\nfree-viewpoints relighting from only human videos under unknown illuminations.\nOur key insight is that the space-time varying geometry and reflectance of the\nhuman body can be decomposed as a set of neural fields of normal, occlusion,\ndiffuse, and specular maps. These neural fields are further integrated into\nreflectance-aware physically based rendering, where each vertex in the neural\nfield absorbs and reflects the light from the environment. The whole framework\ncan be learned from videos in a self-supervised manner, with physically\ninformed priors designed for regularization.

    "abstract": "Though impressive performance has been achieved in specific visual realms\n(e.g. faces, dogs, and places), an omni-vision representation generalizing to\nmany natural visual domains is highly desirable. But, existing benchmarks are\nbiased and inefficient to evaluate the omni-vision representation -- these\nbenchmarks either only include several specific realms, or cover most realms at\nthe expense of subsuming numerous datasets that have extensive realm\noverlapping. In this paper, we propose Omni-Realm Benchmark (OmniBenchmark). It\nincludes 21 realm-wise datasets with 7,372 concepts and 1,074,346 images.\nWithout semantic overlapping, these datasets cover most visual realms\ncomprehensively and meanwhile efficiently. In addition, we propose a new\nsupervised contrastive learning framework, namely Relational Contrastive\nlearning (ReCo), for a better omni-vision representation. Beyond pulling two\ninstances from the same concept closer -- the typical supervised contrastive\nlearning framework -- ReCo also pulls two instances from the same semantic\nrealm closer, encoding the semantic relation between concepts, and facilitating\nomni-vision representation learning. We benchmark ReCo and other advances in\nomni-vision representation studies that are different in architectures (from\nCNNs to transformers) and in learning paradigms (from supervised learning to\nself-supervised learning) on OmniBenchmark. We illustrate the superior of ReCo\nto other supervised contrastive learning methods and reveal multiple practical\nobservations to facilitate future research.",

Prior work on video object segmentation typically only uses one type of\nfeature memory. For videos longer than a minute, a single feature memory model\ntightly links memory consumption and accuracy. In contrast, following the\nAtkinson-Shiffrin model, we develop an architecture that incorporates multiple\nindependent yet deeply-connected feature memory stores: a rapidly updated\nsensory memory, a high-resolution working memory, and a compact thus sustained\nlong-term memory. Crucially, we develop a memory potentiation algorithm that\nroutinely consolidates actively used working memory elements into the long-term\nmemory, which avoids memory explosion and minimizes performance decay for\nlong-term prediction.

    "abstract": "We propose bootstrapped masked autoencoders (BootMAE), a new approach for\nvision BERT pretraining. BootMAE improves the original masked autoencoders\n(MAE) with two core designs: 1) momentum encoder that provides online feature\nas extra BERT prediction targets; 2) target-aware decoder that tries to reduce\nthe pressure on the encoder to memorize target-specific information in BERT\npretraining. The first design is motivated by the observation that using a\npretrained MAE to extract the features as the BERT prediction target for masked\ntokens can achieve better pretraining performance. Therefore, we add a momentum\nencoder in parallel with the original MAE encoder, which bootstraps the\npretraining performance by using its own representation as the BERT prediction\ntarget. In the second design, we introduce target-specific information (e.g.,\npixel values of unmasked patches) from the encoder directly to the decoder to\nreduce the pressure on the encoder of memorizing the target-specific\ninformation. Thus, the encoder focuses on semantic modeling, which is the goal\nof BERT pretraining, and does not need to waste its capacity in memorizing the\ninformation of unmasked tokens related to the prediction target. Through\nextensive experiments, our BootMAE achieves $84.2\\%$ Top-1 accuracy on\nImageNet-1K with ViT-B backbone, outperforming MAE by $+0.8\\%$ under the same\npre-training epochs. BootMAE also gets $+1.0$ mIoU improvements on semantic\nsegmentation on ADE20K and $+1.3$ box AP, $+1.4$ mask AP improvement on object\ndetection and segmentation on COCO dataset.

We accompany this dataset with an open-source Python\npackage to: rebuild or extend the WorldStrat dataset, train and infer baseline\nalgorithms, and learn with abundant tutorials, all compatible with the popular\nEO-learn toolbox. We hereby hope to foster broad-spectrum applications of ML to\nsatellite imagery, and possibly develop from free public low-resolution\nSentinel2 imagery the same power of analysis allowed by costly private\nhigh-resolution imagery. We illustrate this specific point by training and\nreleasing several highly compute-efficient baselines on the task of Multi-Frame\nSuper-Resolution. High-resolution Airbus imagery is CC BY-NC, while the labels\nand Sentinel2 imagery are CC BY, and the source code and pre-trained models\nunder BSD.

    "abstract": "Restoring images distorted by atmospheric turbulence is a long-standing\nproblem due to the spatially varying nature of the distortion, nonlinearity of\nthe image formation process, and scarcity of training and testing data.\nExisting methods often have strong statistical assumptions on the distortion\nmodel which in many cases will lead to a limited performance in real-world\nscenarios as they do not generalize. To overcome the challenge, this paper\npresents an end-to-end physics-driven approach that is efficient and can\ngeneralize to real-world turbulence. On the data synthesis front, we\nsignificantly increase the image resolution that can be handled by the SOTA\nturbulence simulator by approximating the random field via wide-sense\nstationarity. The new data synthesis process enables the generation of\nlarge-scale multi-level turbulence and ground truth pairs for training. On the\nnetwork design front, we propose the turbulence mitigation transformer (TMT), a\ntwo stage U-Net shaped multi-frame restoration network which has a noval\nefficient self-attention mechanism named temporal channel joint attention\n(TCJA). We also introduce a new training scheme that is enabled by the new\nsimulator, and we design new transformer units to reduce the memory\nconsumption.

    "abstract": "Learning-based MRI translation involves a synthesis model that maps a\nsource-contrast onto a target-contrast image. Multi-institutional\ncollaborations are key to training synthesis models across broad datasets, yet\ncentralized training involves privacy risks. Federated learning (FL) is a\ncollaboration framework that instead adopts decentralized training to avoid\nsharing imaging data and mitigate privacy concerns. However, FL-trained models\ncan be impaired by the inherent heterogeneity in the distribution of imaging\ndata. On the one hand, implicit shifts in image distribution are evident across\nsites, even for a common translation task with fixed source-target\nconfiguration. Conversely, explicit shifts arise within and across sites when\ndiverse translation tasks with varying source-target configurations are\nprescribed. To improve reliability against domain shifts, here we introduce the\nfirst personalized FL method for MRI Synthesis (pFLSynth). pFLSynth is based on\nan adversarial model equipped with a mapper that produces latents specific to\nindividual sites and source-target contrasts. It leverages novel\npersonalization blocks that adaptively tune the statistics and weighting of\nfeature maps across the generator based on these latents. To further promote\nsite-specificity, partial model aggregation is employed over downstream layers\nof the generator while upstream layers are retained locally. As such, pFLSynth\nenables training of a unified synthesis model that can reliably generalize\nacross multiple sites and translation tasks. Comprehensive experiments on\nmulti-site datasets clearly demonstrate the enhanced performance of pFLSynth\nagainst prior federated methods in multi-contrast MRI synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Quantum repeater chains can be used to distribute bipartite entanglement\namong two end nodes. We study the limits of entanglement distribution using a\nchain of quantum repeaters that have quantum memories. A maximum storage time,\nknown as cutoff, is enforced on these memories to ensure high-quality\nend-to-end entanglement. To generate end-to-end entanglement, the nodes can\nperform the following operations: wait, attempt the generation of an elementary\nentangled link with its neighbor(s), or perform an entanglement swapping\nmeasurement. Nodes follow a policy that determines what operation they must\nperform in each time step. Global-knowledge policies take into account all the\ninformation about the entanglement already produced. Here, we find\nglobal-knowledge policies that minimize the expected time to produce end-to-end\nentanglement. We model the evolution of this system as a Markov decision\nprocess, and find optimal policies using value and policy iteration. We compare\noptimal global-knowledge policies to a policy in which nodes only use local\ninformation. The advantage in expected delivery time provided by an optimal\nglobal-knowledge policy increases with increasing number of nodes and\ndecreasing probability of successful entanglement swap. The advantage displays\na non-trivial behavior with respect to the cutoff time and the probability of\nsuccessful entanglement generation at the elementary link level.

    "abstract": "Field-of-view (FOV) tissue truncation beyond the lungs is common in routine\nlung screening computed tomography (CT). This poses limitations for\nopportunistic CT- based body composition (BC) assessment as key anatomical\nstructures are missing. Traditionally, extending the FOV of CT is considered as\na CT reconstruction problem using limited data. However, this approach relies\non the projection domain data which might not be available in application. In\nthis work, we formulate the problem from the semantic image extension\nperspective which only requires image data as inputs. The proposed two-stage\nmethod identifies a new FOV border based on the estimated extent of the\ncomplete body and imputes missing tissues in the truncated region. The training\nsamples are simulated using CT slices with complete body in FOV, making the\nmodel development self-supervised. We evaluate the validity of the proposed\nmethod in automatic BC assessment using lung screening CT with limited FOV. The\nproposed method effectively restores the missing tissues and reduces BC\nassessment error introduced by FOV tissue truncation. In the BC assessment for\na large-scale lung screening CT dataset, this correction improves both the\nintra-subject consistency and the correlation with anthropometric\napproximations.

In this study, we propose a biophysical feature based machine\nlearning method for breast cancer detection to improve the performance beyond a\nbenchmark deep learning algorithm and to furthermore provide a color overlay\nvisual map of the probability of malignancy within a lesion. This overall\nframework is termed disease specific imaging. Previously, 150 breast lesions\nwere segmented and classified utilizing a modified fully convolutional network\nand a modified GoogLeNet, respectively. In this study multiparametric analysis\nwas performed within the contoured lesions. Features were extracted from\nultrasound radiofrequency, envelope, and log compressed data based on\nbiophysical and morphological models. The support vector machine with a\nGaussian kernel constructed a nonlinear hyperplane, and we calculated the\ndistance between the hyperplane and data point of each feature in\nmultiparametric space. The distance can quantitatively assess a lesion, and\nsuggest the probability of malignancy that is color coded and overlaid onto B\nmode images. Training and evaluation were performed on in vivo patient data.\nThe overall accuracy for the most common types and sizes of breast lesions in\nour study exceeded 98.0% for classification and 0.98 for an area under the\nreceiver operating characteristic curve, which is more precise than the\nperformance of radiologists and a deep learning system. Further, the\ncorrelation between the probability and BI RADS enables a quantitative\nguideline to predict breast cancer. Therefore, we anticipate that the proposed\nframework can help radiologists achieve more accurate and convenient breast\ncancer classification and detection.",

However,\nthe destructive histochemical staining procedures are usually irreversible,\nmaking it very difficult to obtain multiple stains on the same tissue section.\nHere, we demonstrate a virtual stain transfer framework via a cascaded deep\nneural network (C-DNN) to digitally transform hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)\nstained tissue images into other types of histological stains. Unlike a single\nneural network structure which only takes one stain type as input to digitally\noutput images of another stain type, C-DNN first uses virtual staining to\ntransform autofluorescence microscopy images into H&E and then performs stain\ntransfer from H&E to the domain of the other stain in a cascaded manner. This\ncascaded structure in the training phase allows the model to directly exploit\nhistochemically stained image data on both H&E and the target special stain of\ninterest. This advantage alleviates the challenge of paired data acquisition\nand improves the image quality and color accuracy of the virtual stain transfer\nfrom H&E to another stain. We validated the superior performance of this C-DNN\napproach using kidney needle core biopsy tissue sections and successfully\ntransferred the H&E-stained tissue images into virtual PAS (periodic\nacid-Schiff) stain.

    "abstract": "High-precision positioning accuracy is among the key features of the future\nfifth-generation (5G-advanced) cellular networks to enable a wide variety of\ncommercial, critical, and consumer use cases. 5G new radio (NR) systems have\nrelied on (1) cellular temporal/angular-based positioning methods to provide\nthe indoor environments with a moderate positioning accuracy that is well below\nthe positioning requirements of these future use cases and (2) highly precise\nsatellite carrier phase/code-based positioning methods for the outdoor\ndeployments that are limited by the availability of the satellite coverage.\nThis paper defines the relevant standard mechanisms and algorithms to use the\ncarrier phase cellular-based measurements as a potential solution to achieve a\nhigh-precision positioning estimation accuracy in 5G-advanced NR networks. The\npresented positioning technique is evaluated using high-fidelity system-level\nsimulations for indoor factory (InF) deployment scenarios. The numerical\nresults demonstrate that the presented technique can significantly improve the\npositioning accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art NR positioning methods.\nOur findings in this paper also show that the carrier phase method not only\nprovides an indoor complement to the outdoor satellite positioning but also\nprovides an outdoor alternative to the high-precision satellite methods.",

Existing works mainly focus on the implementation of autoencoder (AE)\nneural networks (NNs) for CSI compression, and consider straightforward\nquantization methods, e.g., uniform quantization, which are generally not\noptimal. With this strategy, it is hard to achieve a low reconstruction error,\nespecially, when the available number of bits reserved for the latent space\nquantization is small. To address this issue, we recommend two different\nmethods: one based on a post training quantization and the second one in which\nthe codebook is found during the training of the AE. Both strategies achieve\nbetter reconstruction accuracy compared to standard quantization techniques.",

    "abstract": "The ideal realization of quantum teleportation relies on having access to an\nideal maximally entangled state; however, in practice, such a state is\ntypically not available and one can instead only realize an approximate\nteleportation. With this in mind, we present a method to quantify the\nperformance of approximate teleportation when using an arbitrary resource\nstate. More specifically, after framing the task of approximate teleportation\nas an optimization of a simulation error over one-way local operations and\nclassical communication (LOCC) channels, we establish a semidefinite relaxation\nof this optimization task by instead optimizing over the larger set of\ntwo-PPT-extendible channels. The main analytical calculations in our paper\nconsist of exploiting the unitary covariance symmetry of the identity channel\nto establish a significant reduction of the computational cost of this latter\noptimization. Next, by exploiting known connections between approximate\nteleportation and quantum error correction, we also apply these concepts to\nestablish bounds on the performance of approximate quantum error correction\nover a given quantum channel. Finally, we evaluate our bounds for some resource\nstates and protocols that are relevant to experimental realizations.",

In this paper we explore the correspondence between generative\nmodels that exist at two distinct scales, using spin glass models as a sandbox\nsystem to investigate this question. We show that the collective dynamics of a\nspecific type of active inference agent is equivalent to sampling from the\nstationary distribution of a spin glass system. A collective of\nspecifically-designed active inference agents can thus be described as\nimplementing a form of sampling-based inference (namely, from a Boltzmann\nmachine) at the higher level. However, this equivalence is very fragile,\nbreaking upon simple modifications to the generative models of the individual\nagents or the nature of their interactions. We discuss the implications of this\ncorrespondence and its fragility for the study of multiscale systems composed\nof Bayesian agents.",

    "abstract": "We give a proof-theoretic as well as a semantic characterization of a logic\nin the signature with conjunction, disjunction, negation, and the universal and\nexistential quantifiers that we suggest has a certain fundamental status. We\npresent a Fitch-style natural deduction system for the logic that contains only\nthe introduction and elimination rules for the logical constants. From this\nstarting point, if one adds the rule that Fitch called Reiteration, one obtains\na proof system for intuitionistic logic in the given signature; if instead of\nadding Reiteration, one adds the rule of Reductio ad Absurdum, one obtains a\nproof system for orthologic; by adding both Reiteration and Reductio, one\nobtains a proof system for classical logic. Arguably neither Reiteration nor\nReductio is as intimately related to the meaning of the connectives as the\nintroduction and elimination rules are, so the base logic we identify serves as\na more fundamental starting point and common ground between proponents of\nintuitionistic logic, orthologic, and classical logic. The algebraic semantics\nfor the logic we motivate proof-theoretically is based on bounded lattices\nequipped with what has been called a weak pseudocomplementation. We show that\nsuch lattice expansions are representable using a set together with a reflexive\nbinary relation satisfying a simple first-order condition, which yields an\nelegant relational semantics for the logic. This builds on our previous study\nof representations of lattices with negations, which we extend and specialize\nfor several types of negation in addition to weak pseudocomplementation; in an\nappendix, we further extend this representation to lattices with implications.\nFinally, we discuss adding to our logic a conditional obeying only introduction\nand elimination rules, interpreted as a modality using a family of\naccessibility relations.",

In this paper, we propose MedFuse, a\nconceptually simple yet promising LSTM-based fusion module that can accommodate\nuni-modal as well as multi-modal input. We evaluate the fusion method and\nintroduce new benchmark results for in-hospital mortality prediction and\nphenotype classification, using clinical time-series data in the MIMIC-IV\ndataset and corresponding chest X-ray images in MIMIC-CXR. Compared to more\ncomplex multi-modal fusion strategies, MedFuse provides a performance\nimprovement by a large margin on the fully paired test set.

Using a binary output, metrics typically used\nin the literature were adapted to account for the fact that the entire tuna\naggregation under the dFAD was considered. The median time it took tuna to\ncolonize the dFADs for the first time varied between 25 and 43 days, depending\non the ocean, and the longest soak and colonization times were registered in\nthe Pacific Ocean. The tuna schools' Continuous Residence Times were generally\nshorter than Continuous Absence Times (median values between 5 and 7 days, and\n9 and 11 days, respectively), in line with the results found by previous\nstudies. Using a regression output, two novel metrics, namely aggregation time\nand disaggregation time, were estimated to obtain further insight into the\nsymmetry of the aggregation process. Across all oceans, the time it took for\nthe tuna aggregation to depart from the dFADs was not significantly longer than\nthe time it took for the aggregation to form. The value of these results in the\ncontext of the \"ecological trap\" hypothesis is discussed, and further analyses\nto enrich and make use of this data source are proposed.",

Currently, popular testing\nmethods such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can\nhave high false negative rates. Consequently, COVID-19 patients are not\naccurately identified nor treated quickly enough to prevent transmission of the\nvirus. However, the recent rise of medical CT data has presented promising\navenues, since CT manifestations contain key characteristics indicative of\nCOVID-19. This study aimed to take a novel approach in the machine\nlearning-based detection of COVID-19 from chest CT scans. First, the dataset\nutilized in this study was derived from three major sources, comprising a total\nof 17,698 chest CT slices across 923 patient cases. Image preprocessing\nalgorithms were then developed to reduce noise by excluding irrelevant\nfeatures. Transfer learning was also implemented with the EfficientNetB7\npre-trained model to provide a backbone architecture and save computational\nresources. Lastly, several explainability techniques were leveraged to\nqualitatively validate model performance by localizing infected regions and\nhighlighting fine-grained pixel details. The proposed model attained an overall\naccuracy of 0.927 and a sensitivity of 0.958. Explainability measures showed\nthat the model correctly distinguished between relevant, critical features\npertaining to COVID-19 chest CT images and normal controls. Deep learning\nframeworks provide efficient, human-interpretable COVID-19 diagnostics that\ncould complement radiologist decisions or serve as an alternative screening\ntool.
