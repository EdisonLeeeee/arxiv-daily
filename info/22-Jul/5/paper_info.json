    "abstract": "In the growing world of machine learning and data analytics, scholars are\nfinding new and innovative ways to solve real-world problems. One solution\ncomes by way of an intersection between healthcare, sports statistics, and data\nsciences. Within the realm of Major League Baseball (MLB), pitchers are\nregarded as the most important roster position. They often are among the\nhighest paid players and are crucial to a franchise's success, but they are\nmore at risk to suffer an injury that sidelines them for over a complete\nseason. The ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) is a small ligament in the elbow\nthat controls the strength and stability of a pitcher's throwing arm. Due to\nrepetitive strain, it is not uncommon for pitchers to tear it partially or\ncompletely during their careers. Repairing this injury requires UCL\nreconstruction surgery, as known informally as Tommy John surgery. In this\npodium abstract, we want to investigate whether we can use machine learning\ntechniques to predict UCL injury by analyzing online pitcher data.",

    "abstract": "Although deep neural networks have enjoyed remarkable success across a wide\nvariety of tasks, their ever-increasing size also imposes significant overhead\non deployment. To compress these models, knowledge distillation was proposed to\ntransfer knowledge from a cumbersome (teacher) network into a lightweight\n(student) network. However, guidance from a teacher does not always improve the\ngeneralization of students, especially when the size gap between student and\nteacher is large. Previous works argued that it was due to the high certainty\nof the teacher, resulting in harder labels that were difficult to fit. To\nsoften these labels, we present a pruning method termed Prediction Uncertainty\nEnlargement (PrUE) to simplify the teacher. Specifically, our method aims to\ndecrease the teacher's certainty about data, thereby generating soft\npredictions for students. We empirically investigate the effectiveness of the\nproposed method with experiments on CIFAR-10/100, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet.\nResults indicate that student networks trained with sparse teachers achieve\nbetter performance. Besides, our method allows researchers to distill knowledge\nfrom deeper networks to improve students further. Our code is made public at:\n\\url{https://github.com/wangshaopu/prue}.",

    "abstract": "Latent fingerprints are important for identifying criminal suspects. However,\nrecognizing a latent fingerprint in a collection of reference fingerprints\nremains a challenge. Most, if not all, of existing methods would extract\nrepresentation features of each fingerprint independently and then compare the\nsimilarity of these representation features for recognition in a different\nprocess. Without the supervision of similarity for the feature extraction\nprocess, the extracted representation features are hard to optimally reflect\nthe similarity of the two compared fingerprints which is the base for matching\ndecision making. In this paper, we propose a new scheme that can model the\npair-relationship of two fingerprints directly as the similarity feature for\nrecognition. The pair-relationship is modeled by a hybrid deep network which\ncan handle the difficulties of random sizes and corrupted areas of latent\nfingerprints.

    "abstract": "Modern retrospective analytics systems leverage cascade architecture to\nmitigate bottleneck for computing deep neural networks (DNNs). However, the\nexisting cascades suffer two limitations: (1) decoding bottleneck is either\nneglected or circumvented, paying significant compute and storage cost for\npre-processing; and (2) the systems are specialized for temporal queries and\nlack spatial query support. This paper presents CoVA, a novel cascade\narchitecture that splits the cascade computation between compressed domain and\npixel domain to address the decoding bottleneck, supporting both temporal and\nspatial queries. CoVA cascades analysis into three major stages where the first\ntwo stages are performed in compressed domain while the last one in pixel\ndomain. First, CoVA detects occurrences of moving objects (called blobs) over a\nset of compressed frames (called tracks). Then, using the track results, CoVA\nprudently selects a minimal set of frames to obtain the label information and\nonly decode them to compute the full DNNs, alleviating the decoding bottleneck.\nLastly, CoVA associates tracks with labels to produce the final analysis\nresults on which users can process both temporal and spatial queries. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that CoVA offers 4.8x throughput improvement over\nmodern cascade systems, while imposing modest accuracy loss.",

    "abstract": "Visual relations form the basis of understanding our compositional world, as\nrelationships between visual objects capture key information in a scene. It is\nthen advantageous to learn relations automatically from the data, as learning\nwith predefined labels cannot capture all possible relations. However, current\nrelation learning methods typically require supervision, and are not designed\nto generalize to scenes with more complicated relational structures than those\nseen during training. Here, we introduce ViRel, a method for unsupervised\ndiscovery and learning of Visual Relations with graph-level analogy. In a\nsetting where scenes within a task share the same underlying relational\nsubgraph structure, our learning method of contrasting isomorphic and\nnon-isomorphic graphs discovers the relations across tasks in an unsupervised\nmanner. Once the relations are learned, ViRel can then retrieve the shared\nrelational graph structure for each task by parsing the predicted relational\nstructure. Using a dataset based on grid-world and the Abstract Reasoning\nCorpus, we show that our method achieves above 95% accuracy in relation\nclassification, discovers the relation graph structure for most tasks, and\nfurther generalizes to unseen tasks with more complicated relational\nstructures.",

    "abstract": "Service meshes play a central role in the modern application ecosystem by\nproviding an easy and flexible way to connect different services that form a\ndistributed application. However, because of the way they interpose on\napplication traffic, they can substantially increase application latency and\nresource consumption. We develop a decompositional approach and a tool, called\nMeshInsight, to systematically characterize the overhead of service meshes and\nto help developers quantify overhead in deployment scenarios of interest. Using\nMeshInsight, we confirm that service meshes can have high overhead -- up to\n185% higher latency and up to 92% more virtual CPU cores for our benchmark\napplications -- but the severity is intimately tied to how they are configured\nand the application workload. The primary contributors to overhead vary based\non the configuration too. IPC (inter-process communication) and socket writes\ndominate when the service mesh operates as a TCP proxy, but protocol parsing\ndominates when it operates as an HTTP proxy. MeshInsight also enables us to\nstudy the end-to-end impact of optimizations to service meshes.

To maintain asynchronous\nstructural evolutions within the graph, we innovatively formulate dynamic\ngraphs as temporal edge sequences associated with joining time of vertices\n(ToV) and timespan of edges (ToE). Then, a time-aware Transformer is proposed\nto embed vertices' dynamic connections and ToEs into the learned vertex\nrepresentations. Meanwhile, we treat each edge sequence as a whole and embed\nits ToV of the first vertex to further encode the time-sensitive information.\nExtensive evaluations on several datasets show that our approach outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art in a wide range of graph mining tasks.

Due to the inherent characteristics of the ED;\nforecasting the number of patients using the services is particularly\nchallenging. And a mismatch between the affluence and the number of medical\nprofessionals can lead to a decrease in the quality of the services provided\nand create problems that have repercussions for the entire hospital, with the\nrequisition of health care workers from other departments and the postponement\nof surgeries.

In 2018, Jaeger and Schulte suggested projectivity of a\nfamily of distributions as a key property, ensuring that marginal inference is\nindependent of the domain size. However, Jaeger and Schulte assume that the\ndomain is characterised only by its size. This contribution extends the notion\nof projectivity from families of distributions indexed by domain size to\nfunctors taking extensional data from a database. This makes projectivity\navailable for the large range of applications taking structured input. We\ntransfer the known attractive properties of projective families of\ndistributions to the new setting. Furthermore, we prove a correspondence\nbetween projectivity and distributions on countably infinite domains, which we\nuse to unify and generalise earlier work on statistical relational\nrepresentations in infinite domains. Finally, we use the extended notion of\nprojectivity to define a further strengthening, which we call\n$\\sigma$-projectivity, and which allows the use of the same representation in\ndifferent modes while retaining projectivity.",

While natural language (NL) is ambiguous, real world tasks and their\nsafety requirements need to be communicated unambiguously. Signal Temporal\nLogic (STL) is a formal logic that can serve as a versatile, expressive, and\nunambiguous formal language to describe robotic tasks. On one hand, existing\nwork in using STL for the robotics domain typically requires end-users to\nexpress task specifications in STL, a challenge for non-expert users.\nOn the other, translating from NL to STL specifications is currently\nrestricted to specific fragments. In this work, we propose DIALOGUESTL, an\ninteractive approach for learning correct and concise STL formulas from (often)\nambiguous NL descriptions. We use a combination of semantic parsing,\npre-trained transformer-based language models, and user-in-the-loop\nclarifications aided by a small number of user demonstrations to predict the\nbest STL formula to encode NL task descriptions. An advantage of mapping NL to\nSTL is that there has been considerable recent work on the use of reinforcement\nlearning (RL) to identify control policies for robots. We show we can use Deep\nQ-Learning techniques to learn optimal policies from the learned STL\nspecifications. We demonstrate that DIALOGUESTL is efficient, scalable, and\nrobust, and has high accuracy in predicting the correct STL formula with a few\nnumber of demonstrations and a few interactions with an oracle user.",

In this paper, we\nidentify an important overfitting phenomenon in optimizing the importance\nweighted return, in which it may be possible for the learned policy to\nessentially avoid making aligned decisions for part of the initial state space.\nWe propose an algorithm to avoid this overfitting through a new\nper-state-neighborhood normalization constraint, and provide a theoretical\njustification of the proposed algorithm.

We test our algorithm in a\nhealthcare-inspired simulator, a logged dataset collected from real hospitals\nand continuous control tasks. These experiments show the proposed method yields\nless overfitting and better test performance compared to state-of-the-art batch\nreinforcement learning algorithms.",

    "abstract": "The advent of numerous indoor location-based services (LBSs) and the\nwidespread use of many types of mobile devices in indoor environments have\nresulted in generating a massive amount of people's location data. While\ngeo-spatial data contains sensitive information about personal activities,\ncollecting it in its raw form may lead to the leak of personal information\nrelating to the people, violating their privacy. This paper proposes a novel\nprivacy-aware framework for aggregating the indoor location data employing the\nLocal Differential Privacy (LDP) technique, in which the user location data is\nchanged locally in the user's device and is sent to the aggregator afterward.\nTherefore, the users' locations are kept hidden from a server or any attackers.\nThe practical feasibility of applying the proposed framework is verified by two\nreal-world datasets. The impact of dataset properties, the privacy mechanisms,\nand the privacy level on our framework are also investigated. The experimental\nresults indicate that the presented framework can protect the location\ninformation of users, and the accuracy of the population frequency of different\nzones in the indoor area is close to that of the original population frequency\nwith no knowledge about the location of people indoors.",

    "abstract": "The Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) protocol is\nincreasingly being adopted by the aviation industry as a method for aircraft to\nrelay their position to Air Traffic Control (ATC) monitoring systems. ADS-B\nprovides greater precision compared to traditional radar-based technologies,\nhowever, it was designed without any encryption or authentication mechanisms\nand has been shown to be susceptible to spoofing attacks. A capable attacker\ncan transmit falsified ADS-B messages with the intent of causing false\ninformation to be shown on ATC displays and threaten the safety of air traffic.\nUpdating the ADS-B protocol will be a lengthy process, therefore, there is a\nneed for systems to detect anomalous ADS-B communications. This paper presents\nATC-Sense, an ADS-B anomaly detection system based on ontologies. An ATC\nontology is used to model entities in a simulated controlled airspace and is\nused to detect falsified ADS-B messages by verifying that the entities conform\nto aviation constraints related to aircraft flight tracks, radar readings, and\nflight reports. We evaluate the computational performance of the proposed\nconstraints-based detection approach with several ADS-B attack scenarios in a\nsimulated ATC environment. We demonstrate how ontologies can be used for\nanomaly detection in a real-time environment and call for future work to\ninvestigate ways to improve the computational performance of such an approach.",

CoPT is more\ncomputationally efficient than semi-supervised training (SST), the standard\napproach of utilizing unlabeled data in ASR, since it omits the need for\npseudo-labeling of the unlabeled data.

    "abstract": "We present a multi-resolution approach for constructing model-based\nsimulations of hydraulic fracturing, wherein flow through porous media is\ncoupled with fluid-driven fracture. The approach consists of a hybrid scheme\nthat couples a discrete crack representation in a global domain to a\nphase-field representation in a local subdomain near the crack tip. The\nmulti-resolution approach addresses issues such as the computational expense of\naccurate hydraulic fracture simulations and the difficulties associated with\nreconstructing crack apertures from diffuse fracture representations. In the\nglobal domain, a coupled system of equations for displacements and pressures is\nconsidered. The crack geometry is assumed to be fixed and the displacement\nfield is enriched with discontinuous functions. Around the crack tips in the\nlocal subdomains, phase-field sub-problems are instantiated on the fly to\npropagate fractures in arbitrary, mesh independent directions. The governing\nequations and fields in the global and local domains are approximated using a\ncombination of finite-volume and finite element discretizations. The efficacy\nof the method is illustrated through various benchmark problems in hydraulic\nfracturing, as well as a new study of fluid-driven crack growth around a stiff\ninclusion.",

    "abstract": "Multi-fidelity modeling and learning are important in physical\nsimulation-related applications. It can leverage both low-fidelity and\nhigh-fidelity examples for training so as to reduce the cost of data generation\nwhile still achieving good performance. While existing approaches only model\nfinite, discrete fidelities, in practice, the fidelity choice is often\ncontinuous and infinite, which can correspond to a continuous mesh spacing or\nfinite element length. In this paper, we propose Infinite Fidelity\nCoregionalization (IFC). Given the data, our method can extract and exploit\nrich information within continuous, infinite fidelities to bolster the\nprediction accuracy. Our model can interpolate and/or extrapolate the\npredictions to novel fidelities, which can be even higher than the fidelities\nof training data. Specifically, we introduce a low-dimensional latent output as\na continuous function of the fidelity and input, and multiple it with a basis\nmatrix to predict high-dimensional solution outputs. We model the latent output\nas a neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) to capture the complex\nrelationships within and integrate information throughout the continuous\nfidelities. We then use Gaussian processes or another ODE to estimate the\nfidelity-varying bases. For efficient inference, we reorganize the bases as a\ntensor, and use a tensor-Gaussian variational posterior to develop a scalable\ninference algorithm for massive outputs.

    "abstract": "The high R/X ratio of typical distribution systems makes the system voltage\nvulnerable to the active power injection from distributed energy resources\n(DERs). Moreover, the intermittent and uncertain nature of the DER generation\nbrings new challenges to the voltage control. This paper proposes a two-stage\nstochastic optimization strategy to optimally place the PV smart inverters with\nVolt-VAr capability for distribution systems with high photovoltaic (PV)\npenetration to mitigate voltage violation issues. The proposed optimization\nstrategy enables a planningstage guide for upgrading the existing PV inverters\nto smart inverters with Volt-VAr capability while considering the\noperationstage characteristics of the Volt-VAr control. One advantage of this\nplanning strategy is that it utilizes the local control capability of the smart\ninverter that requires no communication, thus avoiding issues related to\ncommunication delays and failures. Another advantage is that the Volt-VAr\ncontrol characteristic is internally integrated into the optimization model as\na set of constraints, making placement decisions more accurate. The objective\nof the optimization is to minimize the upgrading cost and the number of the\nsmart inverters required while maintaining the voltage profile within the\nacceptable range. Case studies on an actual 12.47kV, 9km long Arizona utility\nfeeder have been conducted using OpenDSS to validate the effectiveness of the\nproposed placement strategy in both static and dynamic simulations.

    "title": "Human-Assisted Robotic Detection of Foreign Object Debris Inside  Confined Spaces of Marine Vessels Using Probabilistic Mapping",
    "abstract": "Many complex vehicular systems, such as large marine vessels, contain\nconfined spaces like water tanks, which are critical for the safe functioning\nof the vehicles. It is particularly hazardous for humans to inspect such spaces\ndue to limited accessibility, poor visibility, and unstructured configuration.\nWhile robots provide a viable alternative, they encounter the same set of\nchallenges in realizing robust autonomy. In this work, we specifically address\nthe problem of detecting foreign object debris (FODs) left inside the confined\nspaces using a visual mapping-based system that relies on Mahalanobis\ndistance-driven comparisons between the nominal and online maps for local\noutlier identification. Simulation trials show extremely high recall but low\nprecision for the outlier identification method. The assistance of remote\nhumans is, therefore, taken to deal with the precision problem by going over\nthe close-up robot camera images of the outlier regions. An online survey is\nconducted to show the usefulness of this assistance process. Physical\nexperiments are also reported on a GPU-enabled mobile robot platform inside a\nscaled-down, prototype tank to demonstrate the feasibility of the FOD detection\nsystem.",

    "abstract": "Popular graph neural networks are shallow models, despite the success of very\ndeep architectures in other application domains of deep learning. This reduces\nthe modeling capacity and leaves models unable to capture long-range\nrelationships. The primary reason for the shallow design results from\nover-smoothing, which leads node states to become more similar with increased\ndepth. We build on the close connection between GNNs and PageRank, for which\npersonalized PageRank introduces the consideration of a personalization vector.\nAdopting this idea, we propose the Personalized PageRank Graph Neural Network\n(PPRGNN), which extends the graph convolutional network to an infinite-depth\nmodel that has a chance to reset the neighbor aggregation back to the initial\nstate in each iteration. We introduce a nicely interpretable tweak to the\nchance of resetting and prove the convergence of our approach to a unique\nsolution without placing any constraints, even when taking infinitely many\nneighbor aggregations. As in personalized PageRank, our result does not suffer\nfrom over-smoothing. While doing so, time complexity remains linear while we\nkeep memory complexity constant, independently of the depth of the network,\nmaking it scale well to large graphs. We empirically show the effectiveness of\nour approach for various node and graph classification tasks. PPRGNN\noutperforms comparable methods in almost all cases.",

    "abstract": "Three state-of-the-art language-and-image AI models, CLIP, SLIP, and BLIP,\nare evaluated for evidence of a bias previously observed in social and\nexperimental psychology: equating American identity with being White. Embedding\nassociation tests (EATs) using standardized images of self-identified Asian,\nBlack, Latina/o, and White individuals from the Chicago Face Database (CFD)\nreveal that White individuals are more associated with collective in-group\nwords than are Asian, Black, or Latina/o individuals. In assessments of three\ncore aspects of American identity reported by social psychologists,\nsingle-category EATs reveal that images of White individuals are more\nassociated with patriotism and with being born in America, but that, consistent\nwith prior findings in psychology, White individuals are associated with being\nless likely to treat people of all races and backgrounds equally. Three\ndownstream machine learning tasks demonstrate biases associating American with\nWhite. In a visual question answering task using BLIP, 97% of White individuals\nare identified as American, compared to only 3% of Asian individuals. When\nasked in what state the individual depicted lives in, the model responds China\n53% of the time for Asian individuals, but always with an American state for\nWhite individuals. In an image captioning task, BLIP remarks upon the race of\nAsian individuals as much as 36% of the time, but never remarks upon race for\nWhite individuals. Finally, provided with an initialization image from the CFD\nand the text \"an American person,\" a synthetic image generator (VQGAN) using\nthe text-based guidance of CLIP lightens the skin tone of individuals of all\nraces (by 35% for Black individuals, based on pixel brightness).

Existing\nreactive controllers for self-collision avoidance cannot guarantee\ncollision-free trajectories as they do not leverage the robot's full dynamics,\nthus compromising kinematic feasibility. In comparison, the proposed CBF-WBC\ncontroller can reason about the robot's underactuated dynamics in real-time to\nguarantee collision-free motions. The effectiveness of this approach is\nvalidated in simulation. First, a simple hand-reaching experiment shows that\nthe CBF-WBC enables the robot's hand to deviate from an infeasible reference\ntrajectory to avoid self-collisions. Second, the CBF-WBC is combined with a\nlinear model predictive controller (LMPC) designed for dynamic locomotion, and\nthe CBF-WBC is used to track the LMPC predictions. A centroidal angular\nmomentum task is also used to generate arm motions that assist humanoid\nlocomotion and disturbance recovery.

In this paper we\ndemonstrate data pruning-a method for increasing adversarial training\nefficiency through data sub-sampling.We empirically show that data pruning\nleads to improvements in convergence and reliability of adversarial training,\nalbeit with different levels of utility degradation. For example, we observe\nthat using random sub-sampling of CIFAR10 to drop 40% of data, we lose 8%\nadversarial accuracy against the strongest attackers, while by using only 20%\nof data we lose 14% adversarial accuracy and reduce runtime by a factor of 3.\nInterestingly, we discover that in some settings data pruning brings benefits\nfrom both worlds-it both improves adversarial accuracy and training time.",

    "abstract": "Terahertz (THz) communication is widely deemed the next frontier of wireless\nnetworks owing to the abundant spectrum resources in the THz band. Whilst THz\nsignals suffer from severe propagation losses, a massive antenna array can be\ndeployed at the base station (BS) to mitigate those losses through beamforming.\nNevertheless, a large number of antennas increases the hardware complexity and\ncircuit power consumption, and hence it can lead to poor energy efficiency\n(EE). To surmount this fundamental problem, we propose a novel array design\nbased on coupled antenna pairs. Specifically, we exploit the mutual coupling\nbetween closely spaced antennas to form superdirective pairs. A unique property\nof them is that all require the same excitation amplitude, and therefore can be\ndriven by a single radio frequency chain akin to conventional phased arrays.\nMoreover, they facilitate the implementation of multi-port impedance matching,\nwhich ensures maximum power transfer for any beamforming angle. After\naddressing the hardware-related problems of superdirectivity, we show that the\nnumber of BS antennas can be effectively reduced without sacrificing the\nachievable rate. Simulation results showcase that our design offers huge EE\ngains compared to uncoupled uniform linear arrays, and hence could be a radical\nsolution for future THz systems.",

    "abstract": "The knowledge graph (KG) stores a large amount of structural knowledge, while\nit is not easy for direct human understanding. Knowledge graph-to-text\n(KG-to-text) generation aims to generate easy-to-understand sentences from the\nKG, and at the same time, maintains semantic consistency between generated\nsentences and the KG. Existing KG-to-text generation methods phrase this task\nas a sequence-to-sequence generation task with linearized KG as input and\nconsider the consistency issue of the generated texts and KG through a simple\nselection between decoded sentence word and KG node word at each time step.\nHowever, the linearized KG order is commonly obtained through a heuristic\nsearch without data-driven optimization. In this paper, we optimize the\nknowledge description order prediction under the order supervision extracted\nfrom the caption and further enhance the consistency of the generated sentences\nand KG through syntactic and semantic regularization. We incorporate the\nPart-of-Speech (POS) syntactic tags to constrain the positions to copy words\nfrom the KG and employ a semantic context scoring function to evaluate the\nsemantic fitness for each word in its local context when decoding each word in\nthe generated sentence. Extensive experiments are conducted on two datasets,\nWebNLG and DART, and achieve state-of-the-art performances.",

    "abstract": "Unlike ordinary computer vision tasks that focus more on the semantic content\nof images, the image manipulation detection task pays more attention to the\nsubtle information of image manipulation. In this paper, the noise image\nextracted by the improved constrained convolution is used as the input of the\nmodel instead of the original image to obtain more subtle traces of\nmanipulation. Meanwhile, the dual-branch network, consisting of a\nhigh-resolution branch and a context branch, is used to capture the traces of\nartifacts as much as possible. In general, most manipulation leaves\nmanipulation artifacts on the manipulation edge. A specially designed\nmanipulation edge detection module is constructed based on the dual-branch\nnetwork to identify these artifacts better. The correlation between pixels in\nan image is closely related to their distance. The farther the two pixels are,\nthe weaker the correlation. We add a distance factor to the self-attention\nmodule to better describe the correlation between pixels. Experimental results\non four publicly available image manipulation datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our model.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a new Metacognitive Decision Making (MDM) framework\ninspired by human-like metacognitive principles. The MDM framework is\nincorporated in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) deployed for decentralized\nstochastic search without communication for detecting stationary targets\n(fixed/sudden pop-up) and dynamic targets. The UAVs are equipped with multiple\nsensors (varying sensing capability) and search for targets in a largely\nunknown area. The MDM framework consists of a metacognitive component and a\nself-cognitive component. The metacognitive component helps to self-regulate\nthe search with multiple sensors addressing the issues of\n\"which-sensor-to-use\", \"when-to-switch-sensor\", and \"how-to-search\". Each\nsensor possesses inverse characteristics for the sensing attributes like\nsensing range and accuracy. Based on the information gathered by multiple\nsensors carried by each UAV, the self-cognitive component regulates different\nlevels of stochastic search and switching levels for effective searching. The\nlower levels of search aim to localize the search space for the possible\npresence of a target (detection) with different sensors. The highest level of a\nsearch exploits the search space for target confirmation using the sensor with\nthe highest accuracy among all sensors. The performance of the MDM framework\nwith two sensors having low accuracy with wide range sensor for detection and\nincreased accuracy with low range sensor for confirmation is evaluated through\nMonte-Carlo simulations and compared with six multi-UAV stochastic search\nalgorithms (three self-cognitive searches and three self and social-cognitive\nbased search). The results indicate that the MDM framework is efficient in\ndetecting and confirming targets in an unknown environment.",

    "abstract": "Multi-scale architectures and attention modules have shown effectiveness in\nmany deep learning-based image de-raining methods. However, manually designing\nand integrating these two components into a neural network requires a bulk of\nlabor and extensive expertise. In this article, a high-performance multi-scale\nattentive neural architecture search (MANAS) framework is technically developed\nfor image deraining. The proposed method formulates a new multi-scale attention\nsearch space with multiple flexible modules that are favorite to the image\nde-raining task. Under the search space, multi-scale attentive cells are built,\nwhich are further used to construct a powerful image de-raining network. The\ninternal multiscale attentive architecture of the de-raining network is\nsearched automatically through a gradient-based search algorithm, which avoids\nthe daunting procedure of the manual design to some extent. Moreover, in order\nto obtain a robust image de-raining model, a practical and effective\nmulti-to-one training strategy is also presented to allow the de-raining\nnetwork to get sufficient background information from multiple rainy images\nwith the same background scene, and meanwhile, multiple loss functions\nincluding external loss, internal loss, architecture regularization loss, and\nmodel complexity loss are jointly optimized to achieve robust de-raining\nperformance and controllable model complexity.

    "abstract": "Search and retrieval remains a major research topic in several domains,\nincluding computer graphics, computer vision, engineering design, etc. A search\nengine requires primarily an input search query and a database of items to\nsearch from. In engineering, which is the primary context of this paper, the\ndatabase consists of 3D CAD models, such as washers, pistons, connecting rods,\netc. A query from a user is typically in the form of a sketch, which attempts\nto capture the details of a 3D model. However, sketches have certain typical\ndefects such as gaps, over-drawn portions (multi-strokes), etc. Since the\nretrieved results are only as good as the input query, sketches need\ncleaning-up and enhancement for better retrieval results.\nIn this paper, a deep learning approach is proposed to improve or clean the\nquery sketches. Initially, sketches from various categories are analysed in\norder to understand the many possible defects that may occur. A dataset of\ncleaned-up or enhanced query sketches is then created based on an understanding\nof these defects. Consequently, an end-to-end training of a deep neural network\nis carried out in order to provide a mapping between the defective and the\nclean sketches. This network takes the defective query sketch as the input and\ngenerates a clean or an enhanced query sketch. Qualitative and quantitative\ncomparisons of the proposed approach with other state-of-the-art techniques\nshow that the proposed approach is effective. The results of the search engine\nare reported using both the defective and enhanced query sketches, and it is\nshown that using the enhanced query sketches from the developed approach yields\nimproved search results.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the cross-modal pre-training task has been a hotspot because of its\nwide application in various down-streaming researches including retrieval,\ncaptioning, question answering and so on. However, exiting methods adopt a\none-stream pre-training model to explore the united vision-language\nrepresentation for conducting cross-modal retrieval, which easily suffer from\nthe calculation explosion. Moreover, although the conventional double-stream\nstructures are quite efficient, they still lack the vital cross-modal\ninteractions, resulting in low performances. Motivated by these challenges, we\nput forward a Contrastive Cross-Modal Knowledge Sharing Pre-training (COOKIE)\nto grasp the joint text-image representations. Structurally, COOKIE adopts the\ntraditional double-stream structure because of the acceptable time consumption.\nTo overcome the inherent defects of double-stream structure as mentioned above,\nwe elaborately design two effective modules. Concretely, the first module is a\nweight-sharing transformer that builds on the head of the visual and textual\nencoders, aiming to semantically align text and image. This design enables\nvisual and textual paths focus on the same semantics. The other one is three\nspecially designed contrastive learning, aiming to share knowledge between\ndifferent models. The shared cross-modal knowledge develops the study of\nunimodal representation greatly, promoting the single-modal retrieval tasks.\nExtensive experimental results on multi-modal matching researches that includes\ncross-modal retrieval, text matching, and image retrieval reveal the superiors\nin calculation efficiency and statistical indicators of our pre-training model.",

    "abstract": "Language is the principal tool for human communication, in which humor is one\nof the most attractive parts. Producing natural language like humans using\ncomputers, a.k.a, Natural Language Generation (NLG), has been widely used for\ndialogue systems, chatbots, machine translation, as well as computer-aid\ncreation e.g., idea generations, scriptwriting. However, the humor aspect of\nnatural language is relatively under-investigated, especially in the age of\npre-trained language models. In this work, we aim to preliminarily test whether\nNLG can generate humor as humans do. We build a new dataset consisting of\nnumerous digitized Chinese Comical Crosstalk scripts (called C$^3$ in short),\nwhich is for a popular Chinese performing art called `Xiangsheng' since 1800s.\n(For convenience for non-Chinese speakers, we called `crosstalk' for\n`Xiangsheng' in this paper.) We benchmark various generation approaches\nincluding training-from-scratch Seq2seq, fine-tuned middle-scale PLMs, and\nlarge-scale PLMs (with and without fine-tuning). Moreover, we also conduct a\nhuman assessment, showing that 1) large-scale pretraining largely improves\ncrosstalk generation quality; and 2) even the scripts generated from the best\nPLM is far from what we expect, with only 65% quality of human-created\ncrosstalk. We conclude, humor generation could be largely improved using\nlarge-scaled PLMs, but it is still in its infancy.\nThe data and benchmarking code is publicly available in\n\\url{https://github.com/anonNo2/crosstalk-generation}.",

    "abstract": "When performing resilience enhancement for distribution grids, suboptimal\nstrategies induced by misspecified contingency models may lead to unanticipated\nregrets in retrospective analyses. However, there are two obstacles for\nreliably modeling uncertain contingencies: 1) decision-dependent uncertainty\n(DDU) resulting from different line hardening decisions, and 2) distributional\nambiguity due to limited outage information under extreme weather events\n(EWEs). To address these two challenges, this paper constructs scenario-wise\ndecision-dependent ambiguity sets (SWDD-ASs), where the DDU and distributional\nambiguity inherent in EWE-induced contingencies are simultaneously captured\nunder each possible EWE scenario. Then, a two-stage trilevel decision-dependent\ndistributionally robust resilient enhancement (DD-DRRE) model is formulated,\nwhose outputs include the optimal line hardening, distributed generation (DG)\nallocation, and proactive network reconfiguration strategy under the worst-case\ndistributions in SWDD-ASs. Then, the DD-DRRE model are equivalently recast to a\nMILP-based master problem and multiple scenario-wise subproblems, facilitating\nthe utilization of a customized column-and-constraint generation (C&CG)\nalgorithm. Finally, numerical tests demonstrate a remarkable improvement in the\nout-of-sample performance of our model, compared to its prevailing stochastic\nand robust counterparts. Moreover, the potential values of incorporating the\nambiguity and distributional information are quantitatively estimated, which\ncan serve as a useful reference for planners with different budgets and\nrisk-aversion levels.",

In the 2021 Syngenta crop\nchallenge in analytics, Syngenta raised the problem to design an optimization\nmodel for the planting time scheduling in the 2020 year-round breeding process\nso that there is a consistent harvest quantity each week. They released a\ndataset that contained 2569 seed populations with their planting windows,\nrequired growing degree units for harvesting, and their harvest quantities at\ntwo sites. To address this challenge, we developed a new framework that\nconsists of a weather time series model and an optimization model to schedule\nthe planting time. A deep recurrent neural network was designed to predict the\nweather into the future, and a Gaussian process model on top of the time-series\nmodel was developed to model the uncertainty of forecasted weather. The\nproposed optimization models also scheduled the seed population's planting time\nat the fewest number of weeks with a more consistent weekly harvest quantity.\nUsing the proposed optimization models can decrease the required capacity by\n69% at site 0 and up to 51% at site 1 compared to the original planting time.",

    "abstract": "In an information-seeking conversation, a user converses with an agent to ask\na series of questions that can often be under- or over-specified. An ideal\nagent would first identify that they were in such a situation by searching\nthrough their underlying knowledge source and then appropriately interacting\nwith a user to resolve it. However, most existing studies either fail to or\nartificially incorporate such agent-side initiatives. In this work, we present\nINSCIT (pronounced Insight), a dataset for information-seeking conversations\nwith mixed-initiative interactions. It contains a total of 4.7K user-agent\nturns from 805 human-human conversations where the agent searches over\nWikipedia and either asks for clarification or provides relevant information to\naddress user queries. We define two subtasks, namely evidence passage\nidentification and response generation, as well as a new human evaluation\nprotocol to assess the model performance. We report results of two strong\nbaselines based on state-of-the-art models of conversational knowledge\nidentification and open-domain question answering. Both models significantly\nunderperform humans and fail to generate coherent and informative responses,\nsuggesting ample room for improvement in future studies.",

    "abstract": "Recent research has shown that rationales, or step-by-step chains of thought,\ncan be used to improve performance in multi-step reasoning tasks. We reconsider\nrationale-augmented prompting for few-shot in-context learning, where (input ->\noutput) prompts are expanded to (input, rationale -> output) prompts. For\nrationale-augmented prompting we demonstrate how existing approaches, which\nrely on manual prompt engineering, are subject to sub-optimal rationales that\nmay harm performance. To mitigate this brittleness, we propose a unified\nframework of rationale-augmented ensembles, where we identify rationale\nsampling in the output space as the key component to robustly improve\nperformance. This framework is general and can easily be extended to common\nnatural language processing tasks, even those that do not traditionally\nleverage intermediate steps, such as question answering, word sense\ndisambiguation, and sentiment analysis. We demonstrate that rationale-augmented\nensembles achieve more accurate and interpretable results than existing\nprompting approaches--including standard prompting without rationales and\nrationale-based chain-of-thought prompting--while simultaneously improving\ninterpretability of model predictions through the associated rationales.",

In this paper,\nwe explore multimodal classification of documents from Brazil's Supreme Court.\nWe train and evaluate our methods on a novel multimodal dataset of 6,510\nlawsuits (339,478 pages) with manual annotation assigning each page to one of\nsix classes. Each lawsuit is an ordered sequence of pages, which are stored\nboth as an image and as a corresponding text extracted through optical\ncharacter recognition. We first train two unimodal classifiers: a ResNet\npre-trained on ImageNet is fine-tuned on the images, and a convolutional\nnetwork with filters of multiple kernel sizes is trained from scratch on\ndocument texts. We use them as extractors of visual and textual features, which\nare then combined through our proposed Fusion Module.

Moreover, we experiment with bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory\n(biLSTM) networks and linear-chain conditional random fields to model the\nsequential nature of the pages.

The two\nmaterial derivatives in non-conservative and conservative forms are discretized\nbased on the ideas of the two-step backward difference formula of degree two\nalong the trajectory of the fluid particle. Numerical results by the scheme are\npresented. Firstly, the experimental order of convergence of the scheme is\nshown to see the second-order accuracy in time. Secondly, the effect of the\ntransmission boundary condition on a simple domain is discussed; the artificial\nreflections are kept from the Dirichlet boundaries and removed significantly\nfrom the transmission boundaries. Thirdly, the scheme is applied to a complex\npractical domain, i.e., the Bay of Bengal region, which is non-convex and\nincludes islands. The effect of the transmission boundary condition is\ndiscussed again for the complex domain; the artificial reflections are removed\nsignificantly from transmission boundaries, which are set on open sea\nboundaries.

In this paper, we leverage the advances of our recently\nproposed Glow-WaveGAN and propose a noise-independent speech representation\nlearning approach for high-quality voice conversion for noisy target speakers.\nSpecifically, we learn a latent feature space where we ensure that the target\ndistribution modeled by the conversion model is exactly from the modeled\ndistribution of the waveform generator.

Specifically, we introduce a\nnoise-controllable WaveGAN, which directly learns the noise-independent\nacoustic representation from waveform by the encoder and conducts noise control\nin the hidden space through a FiLM module in the decoder. As for the conversion\nmodel, importantly, we use a flow-based model to learn the distribution of\nnoise-independent but speaker-related latent features from phoneme\nposteriorgrams.

While there are techniques for\nverifying DNNs with formal guarantees, they are limited in scalability and\naccuracy. In this paper, we present a novel abstraction-refinement approach for\nscalable and exact DNN verification. Specifically, we propose a novel\nabstraction to break down the size of DNNs by over-approximation. The result of\nverifying the abstract DNN is always conclusive if no spurious counterexample\nis reported. To eliminate spurious counterexamples introduced by abstraction,\nwe propose a novel counterexample-guided refinement that refines the abstract\nDNN to exclude a given spurious counterexample while still over-approximating\nthe original one. Our approach is orthogonal to and can be integrated with many\nexisting verification techniques. For demonstration, we implement our approach\nusing two promising and exact tools Marabou and Planet as the underlying\nverification engines, and evaluate on widely-used benchmarks ACAS Xu, MNIST and\nCIFAR-10.

    "abstract": "The transport capacity of a communication network can be characterized by the\ntransition from a free-flow state to a congested state. Here, we propose a\ndynamic routing strategy in complex networks based on hierarchical bypass\nselections. The routing decisions are made by the reinforcement learning agents\nimplemented at selected nodes with high betweenness centrality. The learning\nprocesses of the agents are decoupled from each other due to the degeneracy of\ntheir bypasses. Through interactions mediated by the underlying traffic\ndynamics, the agents act cooperatively, and coherent actions arise\nspontaneously. With only a small number of agents, the transport capacities are\nsignificantly improved, including in real-world Internet networks at the router\nlevel and the autonomous system level. Our strategy is also resilient to link\nremovals.",

    "abstract": "Free-text rationales aim to explain neural language model (LM) behavior more\nflexibly and intuitively via natural language. To ensure rationale quality, it\nis important to have metrics for measuring rationales' faithfulness (reflects\nLM's actual behavior) and plausibility (convincing to humans). All existing\nfree-text rationale metrics are based on simulatability (association between\nrationale and LM's predicted label), but there is no protocol for assessing\nsuch metrics' reliability. To investigate this, we propose FRAME, a framework\nfor evaluating free-text rationale simulatability metrics. FRAME is based on\nthree axioms: (1) good metrics should yield highest scores for reference\nrationales, which maximize rationale-label association by construction; (2)\ngood metrics should be appropriately sensitive to semantic perturbation of\nrationales; and (3) good metrics should be robust to variation in the LM's task\nperformance. Across three text classification datasets, we show that existing\nsimulatability metrics cannot satisfy all three FRAME axioms, since they are\nimplemented via model pretraining which muddles the metric's signal. We\nintroduce a non-pretraining simulatability variant that improves performance on\n(1) and (3) by an average of 41.7% and 42.9%, respectively, while performing\ncompetitively on (2).",

With the\ngradually complex human-computer interaction requirements (e.g., multimodal\ninputs, time sensitivity), it is difficult for traditional text-based dialogue\nsystem to meet the demands for more vivid and convenient interaction.\nConsequently, Visual Context Augmented Dialogue System (VAD), which has the\npotential to communicate with humans by perceiving and understanding multimodal\ninformation (i.e., visual context in images or videos, textual dialogue\nhistory), has become a predominant research paradigm. Benefiting from the\nconsistency and complementarity between visual and textual context, VAD\npossesses the potential to generate engaging and context-aware responses. For\ndepicting the development of VAD, we first characterize the concepts and unique\nfeatures of VAD, and then present its generic system architecture to illustrate\nthe system workflow. Subsequently, several research challenges and\nrepresentative works are detailed investigated, followed by the summary of\nauthoritative benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Few-shot fine-grained learning aims to classify a query image into one of a\nset of support categories with fine-grained differences. Although learning\ndifferent objects' local differences via Deep Neural Networks has achieved\nsuccess, how to exploit the query-support cross-image object semantic relations\nin Transformer-based architecture remains under-explored in the few-shot\nfine-grained scenario. In this work, we propose a Transformer-based\ndouble-helix model, namely HelixFormer, to achieve the cross-image object\nsemantic relation mining in a bidirectional and symmetrical manner. The\nHelixFormer consists of two steps: 1) Relation Mining Process (RMP) across\ndifferent branches, and 2) Representation Enhancement Process (REP) within each\nindividual branch. By the designed RMP, each branch can extract fine-grained\nobject-level Cross-image Semantic Relation Maps (CSRMs) using information from\nthe other branch, ensuring better cross-image interaction in semantically\nrelated local object regions. Further, with the aid of CSRMs, the developed REP\ncan strengthen the extracted features for those discovered semantically-related\nlocal regions in each branch, boosting the model's ability to distinguish\nsubtle feature differences of fine-grained objects. Extensive experiments\nconducted on five public fine-grained benchmarks demonstrate that HelixFormer\ncan effectively enhance the cross-image object semantic relation matching for\nrecognizing fine-grained objects, achieving much better performance over most\nstate-of-the-art methods under 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios.

In recent years,\nprediction models based on deep learning have been widely used due to their\nimpressive performance. However, recent studies have shown that deep learning\nmodels trained on a dataset following a long-tailed driving scenario\ndistribution will suffer from large prediction errors in the \"tails,\" which\nmight lead to failures of the planner. To this end, this work defines a notion\nof prediction model uncertainty to quantify high errors due to sparse data.\nMoreover, this work proposes a trajectory planner to consider such prediction\nuncertainty for safer performance. Firstly, the prediction model's uncertainty\ndue to insufficient training data is estimated by an ensemble network\nstructure. Then a trajectory planner is designed to consider the worst-case\narising from prediction uncertainty. The results show that the proposed method\ncan improve the safety of trajectory planning under the prediction uncertainty\ncaused by insufficient data. At the same time, with sufficient data, the\nframework will not lead to overly conservative results.

The system mainly\nimplements two functions based on the activity inference of the sensor data,\nwhich are real time abnormal activity monitoring and trend prediction of\ndisease related activities. Specifically, CASAS dataset is employed to train a\nRandom Forest (RF) model for activity inference. Then, another RF model trained\nby the output data of activity inference is used for abnormal activity\nmonitoring. Particularly, RF is chosen for these tasks because of its balanced\ntrade offs between accuracy, time efficiency, flexibility, and\ninterpretability. Moreover, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) is utilised to\nforecast the disease related activity trend of a patient. Consequently, the\naccuracy of two RF classifiers designed for activity inference and abnormal\nactivity detection is greater than 99 percent and 94 percent, respectively.\nFurthermore, using the duration of sleep as an example, the LSTM model achieves\naccurate and evident future trends prediction.",

However, the label\nobtained by the cytological biopsy which is the golden standard in clinical\nmedicine is not always consistent with the ultrasound imaging TI-RADS criteria.\nThe information difference between the two causes the existing deep\nlearning-based classification methods to be indecisive. To solve the\nInconsistent Label problem, we propose an Adaptive Curriculum Learning (ACL)\nframework, which adaptively discovers and discards the samples with\ninconsistent labels.

Moreover, we contribute TNCD:\na Thyroid Nodule Classification Dataset to facilitate future related research\non the thyroid nodules. Extensive experimental results on TNCD based on three\ndifferent backbone networks not only demonstrate the superiority of our method\nbut also prove that the less-is-more principle which strategically discards the\nsamples with Inconsistent Label could yield performance gains.

Based on the observations, we propose a novel CRS model, coined\nCustomized Conversational Recommender System (CCRS), which customizes CRS model\nfor users from three perspectives.

    "abstract": "Nowadays, intelligent highway traffic network is playing an important role in\nmodern transportation infrastructures. A variable speed limit (VSL) system can\nbe facilitated in the highway traffic network to provide useful and dynamic\nspeed limit information for drivers to travel with enhanced safety. Such system\nis usually designed with a steady advisory speed in mind so that traffic can\nmove smoothly when drivers follow the speed, rather than speeding up whenever\nthere is a gap and slowing down at congestion. However, little attention has\nbeen given to the research of vehicles' behaviours when drivers left the road\nnetwork governed by a VSL system, which may largely involve unexpected\nacceleration, deceleration and frequent lane changes, resulting in chaos for\nthe subsequent highway road users. In this paper, we focus on the detection of\ntraffic flow anomaly due to drivers' lane change intention on the highway\ntraffic networks after a VSL system. More specifically, we apply graph\nmodelling on the traffic flow data generated by a popular mobility simulator,\nSUMO, at road segment levels. We then evaluate the performance of lane changing\ndetection using the proposed Lane-GNN scheme, an attention temporal graph\nconvolutional neural network, and compare its performance with a temporal\nconvolutional neural network (TCNN) as our baseline. Our experimental results\nshow that the proposed Lane-GNN can detect drivers' lane change intention\nwithin 90 seconds with an accuracy of 99.42% under certain assumptions.\nFinally, some interpretation methods are applied to the trained models with a\nview to further illustrate our findings.",

Beyond the traditional wisdom, we raise an intriguing\nquestion: Is it possible to exploit an intermediate yet misaligned image\nbetween two low-overlap point clouds to enhance the performance of cutting-edge\nregistration models? To answer it, we propose a misaligned image supported\nregistration network for low-overlap point cloud pairs, dubbed ImLoveNet.\nImLoveNet first learns triple deep features across different modalities and\nthen exports these features to a two-stage classifier, for progressively\nobtaining the high-confidence overlap region between the two point clouds.\nTherefore, soft correspondences are well established on the predicted overlap\nregion, resulting in accurate rigid transformations for registration. ImLoveNet\nis simple to implement yet effective, since 1) the misaligned image provides\nclearer overlap information for the two low-overlap point clouds to better\nlocate overlap parts; 2) it contains certain geometry knowledge to extract\nbetter deep features; and 3) it does not require the extrinsic parameters of\nthe imaging device with respect to the reference frame of the 3D point cloud.\nExtensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on different kinds of\nbenchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our ImLoveNet over\nstate-of-the-art approaches.",

The protection of society through manual labor is limited and\ninefficient. The unpredictable nature of the marine environment also makes\nmanual operations risky. The use of robots for underwater operations has become\na trend. However, the underwater image acquisition has defects such as weak\nlight, low resolution, and many interferences, while the existing target\ndetection algorithms are not effective. Based on this, we propose an underwater\ntarget detection algorithm based on Attention Improved YOLOv5, called\nUTD-Yolov5. It can quickly and efficiently detect COTS, which in turn provides\na prerequisite for complex underwater operations. We adjusted the original\nnetwork architecture of YOLOv5 in multiple stages, including: replacing the\noriginal Backbone with a two-stage cascaded CSP (CSP2); introducing the visual\nchannel attention mechanism module SE; designing random anchor box similarity\ncalculation method etc. These operations enable UTD-Yolov5 to detect more\nflexibly and capture features more accurately. In order to make the network\nmore efficient, we also propose optimization methods such as WBF and iterative\nrefinement mechanism.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms show amazing performance in recent\nyears, but placing RL in real-world applications such as self-driven vehicles\nmay suffer safety problems. A self-driven vehicle moving to a target position\nfollowing a learned policy may suffer a vehicle with unpredictable aggressive\nbehaviors or even being pursued by a vehicle following a Nash strategy. To\naddress the safety issue of the self-driven vehicle in this scenario, this\npaper conducts a preliminary study based on a system of robots. A safe RL\nframework with safety guarantees is developed for a robot being pursued but\nwith objectives covering more than capture-avoidance. Simulations and\nexperiments are conducted based on the system of robots to evaluate the\neffectiveness of the developed safe RL framework.",

    "title": "Sikkel: Multimode Simple Type Theory as an Agda Library",
    "abstract": "Many variants of type theory extend a basic theory with additional primitives\nor properties like univalence, guarded recursion or parametricity, to enable\nconstructions or proofs that would be harder or impossible to do in the\noriginal theory. However, implementing such extended type theories (either from\nscratch or by modifying an existing implementation) is a big hurdle for their\nwider adoption. In this paper we present Sikkel, a library in the dependently\ntyped programming language Agda that allows users to program in extended type\ntheories. It uses a deeply embedded language that can be easily extended with\nadditional type and term constructors, thus supporting a wide variety of type\ntheories. Moreover, Sikkel has a type checker that is sound by construction in\nthe sense that all well-typed programs are automatically translated to their\nsemantics in a shallow embedding based on presheaf models. Additionally, our\nmodel supports combining different base categories by using modalities to\ntransport definitions between them. This enables in particular a general\napproach for extracting definitions to the meta-level, so that we can use the\nextended type theories to define regular Agda functions and prove properties of\nthem. In this paper, we demonstrate Sikkel theories with guarded recursion and\nparametricity, but other extensions can be easily plugged in. For now, Sikkel\nsupports only simple type theories but its model already anticipates the future\naddition of dependent types and a universe.",

To facilitate the comparison of existing\nstrategies and provide a baseline for evaluating novel strategies, we evaluate\nthe performance of several well-known active learning strategies on three\ndatasets from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon.

We show that both symbolic and automatic differentiation can be\nperformed using a differential calculus for generating linear functions\nrepresenting Fr\\'echet derivatives based on rules for primitive, constant,\nlinear and bilinear functions as well as their sequential and parallel\ncomposition. Linear functions are represented in a combinatory domain-specific\nlanguage. Finally, we provide a calculus for symbolically computing the adjoint\nof a derivative without using matrices, which are too inefficient to use on\nhigh-dimensional spaces. The resulting symbolic representation of a derivative\nretains the data-parallel operations from the input program. The combination of\ncombinatory differentiation and computing formal adjoints turns out to be\nbehaviorally equivalent to reverse-mode automatic differentiation. In\nparticular, it provides opportunities for optimizations where matrices are too\ninefficient to represent linear functions.",

Strength is non-trivial: it can\nbe difficult to determine whether a monad has any strength at all, and monads\ncan be strong in multiple ways. We therefore review some of the most important\nknown facts about strength and prove some new ones. In particular, we present a\nnumber of equivalent characterizations of strong functor and strong monad, and\ngive some conditions that guarantee existence or uniqueness of strengths.

The main contribution of this work is to identify the information\nneeded (in particular, the past history of the output) to remove the hidden\nstate dependence in Koopman-type inverse operators for linear systems.\nAdditionally, it is shown that the time history of the output should be\naugmented with the instantaneous time derivatives of the output to achieve\nprecision of the inverse operator.

Results showed that TCPGen with GNN encodings achieved\nabout a further 15% relative WER reduction on the biasing words compared to the\noriginal TCPGen, with a negligible increase in the computation cost for\ndecoding.",

    "abstract": "In multi-view 3D object detection tasks, disparity supervision over\noverlapping image regions substantially improves the overall detection\nperformance. However, current multi-view 3D object detection methods often fail\nto detect objects in the overlap region properly, and the network's\nunderstanding of the scene is often limited to that of a monocular detection\nnetwork. To mitigate this issue, we advocate for applying the traditional\nstereo disparity estimation method to obtain reliable disparity information for\nthe overlap region. Given the disparity estimates as a supervision, we propose\nto regularize the network to fully utilize the geometric potential of binocular\nimages, and improve the overall detection accuracy. Moreover, we propose to use\nan adversarial overlap region discriminator, which is trained to minimize the\nrepresentational gap between non-overlap regions and overlapping regions where\nobjects are often largely occluded or suffer from deformation due to camera\ndistortion, causing a domain shift. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed method with the large-scale multi-view 3D object detection benchmark,\ncalled nuScenes.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enables learning a global machine learning model from\nlocal data distributed among a set of participating workers. This makes it\npossible i) to train more accurate models due to learning from rich joint\ntraining data, and ii) to improve privacy by not sharing the workers' local\nprivate data with others. However, the distributed nature of FL makes it\nvulnerable to targeted poisoning attacks that negatively impact the integrity\nof the learned model while, unfortunately, being difficult to detect. Existing\ndefenses against those attacks are limited by assumptions on the workers' data\ndistribution, may degrade the global model performance on the main task and/or\nare ill-suited to high-dimensional models. In this paper, we analyze targeted\nattacks against FL and find that the neurons in the last layer of a deep\nlearning (DL) model that are related to the attacks exhibit a different\nbehavior from the unrelated neurons, making the last-layer gradients valuable\nfeatures for attack detection. Accordingly, we propose \\textit{FL-Defender} as\na method to combat FL targeted attacks. It consists of i) engineering more\nrobust discriminative features by calculating the worker-wise angle similarity\nfor the workers' last-layer gradients, ii) compressing the resulting similarity\nvectors using PCA to reduce redundant information, and iii) re-weighting the\nworkers' updates based on their deviation from the centroid of the compressed\nsimilarity vectors. Experiments on three data sets with different DL model\nsizes and data distributions show the effectiveness of our method at defending\nagainst label-flipping and backdoor attacks.

We\npresent a new dataset that we prepare by curating the COVID-19 case reports.\nThe proposed approach outperforms the baseline methods on five benchmark\ndatasets with macro-and micro-average F1 scores around 90, as well as our\ndataset with a macro-and micro-average F1 score of 95.25 and 93.18\nrespectively.",

    "abstract": "Advances in science and engineering often reveal the limitations of classical\napproaches initially used to understand, predict, and control phenomena. With\nprogress, conceptual categories must often be re-evaluated to better track\nrecently discovered invariants across disciplines. It is essential to refine\nframeworks and resolve conflicting boundaries between disciplines such that\nthey better facilitate, not restrict, experimental approaches and capabilities.\nIn this essay, we discuss issues at the intersection of developmental biology,\ncomputer science, and robotics. In the context of biological robots, we explore\nchanges across concepts and previously distinct fields that are driven by\nrecent advances in materials, information, and life sciences. Herein, each\nauthor provides their own perspective on the subject, framed by their own\ndisciplinary training. We argue that as with computation, certain aspects of\ndevelopmental biology and robotics are not tied to specific materials; rather,\nthe consilience of these fields can help to shed light on issues of multi-scale\ncontrol, self-assembly, and relationships between form and function. We hope\nnew fields can emerge as boundaries arising from technological limitations are\novercome, furthering practical applications from regenerative medicine to\nuseful synthetic living machines.",

    "abstract": "Transformer-based models have demonstrated their effectiveness in automatic\nspeech recognition (ASR) tasks and even shown superior performance over the\nconventional hybrid framework. The main idea of Transformers is to capture the\nlong-range global context within an utterance by self-attention layers.\nHowever, for scenarios like conversational speech, such utterance-level\nmodeling will neglect contextual dependencies that span across utterances. In\nthis paper, we propose to explicitly model the inter-sentential information in\na Transformer based end-to-end architecture for conversational speech\nrecognition. Specifically, for the encoder network, we capture the contexts of\nprevious speech and incorporate such historic information into current input by\na context-aware residual attention mechanism. For the decoder, the prediction\nof current utterance is also conditioned on the historic linguistic information\nthrough a conditional decoder framework. We show the effectiveness of our\nproposed method on several open-source dialogue corpora and the proposed method\nconsistently improved the performance from the utterance-level\nTransformer-based ASR models.",

    "title": "Towards Robust Video Object Segmentation with Adaptive Object  Calibration",
    "abstract": "In the booming video era, video segmentation attracts increasing research\nattention in the multimedia community. Semi-supervised video object\nsegmentation (VOS) aims at segmenting objects in all target frames of a video,\ngiven annotated object masks of reference frames. Most existing methods build\npixel-wise reference-target correlations and then perform pixel-wise tracking\nto obtain target masks. Due to neglecting object-level cues, pixel-level\napproaches make the tracking vulnerable to perturbations, and even\nindiscriminate among similar objects. Towards robust VOS, the key insight is to\ncalibrate the representation and mask of each specific object to be expressive\nand discriminative. Accordingly, we propose a new deep network, which can\nadaptively construct object representations and calibrate object masks to\nachieve stronger robustness. First, we construct the object representations by\napplying an adaptive object proxy (AOP) aggregation method, where the proxies\nrepresent arbitrary-shaped segments at multi-levels for reference. Then,\nprototype masks are initially generated from the reference-target correlations\nbased on AOP. Afterwards, such proto-masks are further calibrated through\nnetwork modulation, conditioning on the object proxy representations. We\nconsolidate this conditional mask calibration process in a progressive manner,\nwhere the object representations and proto-masks evolve to be discriminative\niteratively. Extensive experiments are conducted on the standard VOS\nbenchmarks, YouTube-VOS-18/19 and DAVIS-17. Our model achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance among existing published works, and also exhibits\nsuperior robustness against perturbations.

By\nprogrammatically incorporating information on the evolving distribution of\nscientific expertise from research papers, our approach follows the\ndistribution of content in the literature while avoiding the scientific crowd\nand the hypotheses cognitively available to it. We use this approach to\ngenerate valuable predictions for what materials possess valuable\nenergy-related properties (e.g., thermoelectricity), and what compounds possess\nvaluable medical properties (e.g., asthma) that complement the human scientific\ncrowd. We demonstrate that our complementary predictions, if identified by\nhuman scientists and inventors at all, are only discovered years further into\nthe future. When we evaluate the promise of our predictions with\nfirst-principles equations, we demonstrate that increased complementarity of\nour predictions does not decrease and in some cases increases the probability\nthat the predictions possess the targeted properties.

In practical dynamic wireless environments, channel modeling is\nchallenging due to time-varying and multipath effects. In this paper, we\nformulate the beam alignment problem as a non-stationary online learning\nproblem with the objective to maximize the received signal strength under\ninterference constraint. In particular, we employ the non-stationary kernelized\nbandit to leverage the correlation among beams and model the complex\nbeamforming and multipath channel functions. Furthermore, to mitigate\ninterference to other user equipment, we leverage the primal-dual method to\ndesign a constrained UCB-type kernelized bandit algorithm. Our theoretical\nanalysis indicates that the proposed algorithm can adaptively adjust the beam\nin time-varying environments, such that both the cumulative regret of the\nreceived signal and constraint violations have sublinear bounds with respect to\ntime. This result is of independent interest for applications such as adaptive\npricing and news ranking. In addition, the algorithm assumes the channel is a\nblack-box function and does not require any prior knowledge for dynamic channel\nmodeling, and thus is applicable in a variety of scenarios. We further show\nthat if the information about the channel variation is known, the algorithm\nwill have better theoretical guarantees and performance.

On the other hand, excessive training\nin simulation can cause policies to overfit to the visual appearance and\ndynamics of the simulator. In this work, we study strategies to automatically\ndetermine when policies trained in simulation can be reliably transferred to a\nphysical robot. We specifically study these ideas in the context of robotic\nfabric manipulation, in which successful sim2real transfer is especially\nchallenging due to the difficulties of precisely modeling the dynamics and\nvisual appearance of fabric. Results in a fabric smoothing task suggest that\nour switching criteria correlate well with performance in real. In particular,\nour confidence-based switching criteria achieve average final fabric coverage\nof 87.2-93.7% within 55-60% of the total training budget.

Sky-image-based solar\nforecasting using deep learning has been recognized as a promising approach to\npredicting the short-term fluctuations. However, there are few publicly\navailable standardized benchmark datasets for image-based solar forecasting,\nwhich limits the comparison of different forecasting models and the exploration\nof forecasting methods. To fill these gaps, we introduce SKIPP'D -- a SKy\nImages and Photovoltaic Power Generation Dataset. The dataset contains three\nyears (2017-2019) of quality-controlled down-sampled sky images and PV power\ngeneration data that is ready-to-use for short-term solar forecasting using\ndeep learning. In addition, to support the flexibility in research, we provide\nthe high resolution, high frequency sky images and PV power generation data as\nwell as the concurrent sky video footage.

    "abstract": "Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is a widely used similarity measure for comparing\nstrings that encode time series data, with applications to areas including\nbioinformatics, signature verification, and speech recognition. The standard\ndynamic-programming algorithm for DTW takes $O(n^2)$ time, and there are\nconditional lower bounds showing that no algorithm can do substantially better.\nIn many applications, however, the strings $x$ and $y$ may contain long runs\nof repeated letters, meaning that they can be compressed using run-length\nencoding. A natural question is whether the DTW-distance between these\ncompressed strings can be computed efficiently in terms of the lengths $k$ and\n$\\ell$ of the compressed strings. Recent work has shown how to achieve\n$O(k\\ell^2 + \\ell k^2)$ time, leaving open the question of whether a\nnear-quadratic $\\tilde{O}(k\\ell)$-time algorithm might exist.\nWe show that, if a small approximation loss is permitted, then a\nnear-quadratic time algorithm is indeed possible: our algorithm computes a $(1\n+ \\epsilon)$-approximation for $DTW(x, y)$ in $\\tilde{O}(k\\ell / \\epsilon^3)$\ntime, where $k$ and $\\ell$ are the number of runs in $x$ and $y$. Our algorithm\nallows for $DTW$ to be computed over any metric space $(\\Sigma, \\delta)$ in\nwhich distances are $O(log(n))$-bit integers. Surprisingly, the algorithm also\nworks even if $\\delta$ does not induce a metric space on $\\Sigma$ (e.g.,\n$\\delta$ need not satisfy the triangle inequality).",

    "abstract": "Social games like the prisoner's dilemma are often used to develop models of\nthe role of emotion in social decision-making. Here we examine an understudied\naspect of emotion in such games: how an individual's feelings are shaped by\ntheir partner's expressions. Prior research has tended to focus on other\naspects of emotion. Research on felt-emotion has focused on how an individual's\nfeelings shape how they treat their partner, or whether these feelings are\nauthentically expressed. Research on expressed-emotion has focused on how an\nindividual's decisions are shaped by their partner's expressions, without\nregard for whether these expressions actually evoke feelings. Here, we use\ncomputer-generated characters to examine how an individual's moment-to-moment\nfeelings are shaped by (1) how they are treated by their partner and (2) what\ntheir partner expresses during this treatment. Surprisingly, we find that\npartner expressions are far more important than actions in determining\nself-reported feelings. In other words, our partner can behave in a selfish and\nexploitive way, but if they show a collaborative pattern of expressions, we\nwill feel greater pleasure collaborating with them. These results also\nemphasize the importance of context in determining how someone will feel in\nresponse to an expression (i.e., knowing a partner is happy is insufficient; we\nmust know what they are happy-at).

The goal is to maintain a $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximate maximum\nmatching for constant $\\epsilon>0$, while minimizing the update time. In the\nfully dynamic setting, where both edge insertion and deletions are allowed,\nGupta and Peng (see \\cite{GP13}) gave an algorithm for this problem with an\nupdate time of $O(\\sqrt{m}/\\epsilon^2)$.\nMotivated by the fact that the $O_{\\epsilon}(\\sqrt{m})$ barrier is hard to\novercome (see Henzinger, Krinninger, Nanongkai, and Saranurak [HKNS15]);\nKopelowitz, Pettie, and Porat [KPP16]), we study this problem in the\n\\emph{decremental} model, where the adversary is only allowed to delete edges.\nRecently, Bernstein, Probst-Gutenberg, and Saranurak (see [BPT20]) gave an\n$O_{\\epsilon}(1)$ update time decremental algorithm for this problem in\n\\emph{bipartite graphs}. However, beating $O(\\sqrt{m})$ update time remained an\nopen problem for \\emph{general graphs}.\nIn this paper, we bridge the gap between bipartite and general graphs, by\ngiving an $O_{\\epsilon}(1)$ update time algorithm that maintains a\n$(1+\\epsilon)$-approximate maximum integral matching under adversarial\ndeletions. Our algorithm is randomized, but works against an adaptive\nadversary. Together with the work of Grandoni, Leonardi, Sankowski,\nSchwiegelshohn, and Solomon [GLSSS19] who give an $O_{\\epsilon}(1)$ update time\nalgorithm for general graphs in the \\emph{incremental} (insertion-only) model,\nour result essentially completes the picture for partially dynamic matching.",

    "abstract": "Aiming at the problem that the spatial-temporal hierarchical continuous sign\nlanguage recognition model based on deep learning has a large amount of\ncomputation, which limits the real-time application of the model, this paper\nproposes a temporal super-resolution network(TSRNet). The data is reconstructed\ninto a dense feature sequence to reduce the overall model computation while\nkeeping the final recognition accuracy loss to a minimum. The continuous sign\nlanguage recognition model(CSLR) via TSRNet mainly consists of three parts:\nframe-level feature extraction, time series feature extraction and TSRNet,\nwhere TSRNet is located between frame-level feature extraction and time-series\nfeature extraction, which mainly includes two branches: detail descriptor and\nrough descriptor. The sparse frame-level features are fused through the\nfeatures obtained by the two designed branches as the reconstructed dense\nframe-level feature sequence, and the connectionist temporal\nclassification(CTC) loss is used for training and optimization after the\ntime-series feature extraction part. To better recover semantic-level\ninformation, the overall model is trained with the self-generating adversarial\ntraining method proposed in this paper to reduce the model error rate. The\ntraining method regards the TSRNet as the generator, and the frame-level\nprocessing part and the temporal processing part as the discriminator. In\naddition, in order to unify the evaluation criteria of model accuracy loss\nunder different benchmarks, this paper proposes word error rate\ndeviation(WERD), which takes the error rate between the estimated word error\nrate (WER) and the reference WER obtained by the reconstructed frame-level\nfeature sequence and the complete original frame-level feature sequence as the\nWERD. Experiments on two large-scale sign language datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed model.",

    "abstract": "There is a growing concern about typically opaque decision-making with\nhigh-performance machine learning algorithms. Providing an explanation of the\nreasoning process in domain-specific terms can be crucial for adoption in\nrisk-sensitive domains such as healthcare. We argue that machine learning\nalgorithms should be interpretable by design and that the language in which\nthese interpretations are expressed should be domain- and task-dependent.\nConsequently, we base our model's prediction on a family of user-defined and\ntask-specific binary functions of the data, each having a clear interpretation\nto the end-user. We then minimize the expected number of queries needed for\naccurate prediction on any given input. As the solution is generally\nintractable, following prior work, we choose the queries sequentially based on\ninformation gain. However, in contrast to previous work, we need not assume the\nqueries are conditionally independent. Instead, we leverage a stochastic\ngenerative model (VAE) and an MCMC algorithm (Unadjusted Langevin) to select\nthe most informative query about the input based on previous query-answers.\nThis enables the online determination of a query chain of whatever depth is\nrequired to resolve prediction ambiguities.

In this work, we introduce a novel parallel robot gripper\ndesign and a method for collecting spectral readings and visual images from\nwithin the gripper finger. We train a nonlinear Support Vector Machine (SVM)\nthat can classify the material of the object about to be grasped through\nrecursive estimation, with increasing confidence as the distance from the\nfinger tips to the object decreases. In order to validate the hardware design\nand classification method, we collect samples from 16 real and fake fruit\nvarieties (composed of polystyrene/plastic) resulting in a dataset containing\nspectral curves, scene images, and high-resolution texture images as the\nobjects are grasped, lifted, and released.

    "abstract": "Verifiable ledger databases protect data history against malicious tampering.\nExisting systems, such as blockchains and certificate transparency, are based\non transparency logs -- a simple abstraction allowing users to verify that a\nlog maintained by an untrusted server is append-only. They expose a simple\nkey-value interface. Building a practical database from transparency logs, on\nthe other hand, remains a challenge.\nIn this paper, we explore the design space of verifiable ledger databases\nalong three dimensions: abstraction, threat model, and performance. We survey\nexisting systems and identify their two limitations, namely, the lack of\ntransaction support and the inferior efficiency. We then present GlassDB, a\ndistributed database that addresses these limitations under a practical threat\nmodel. GlassDB inherits the verifiability of transparency logs, but supports\ntransactions and offers high performance. It extends a ledger-like key-value\nstore with a data structure for efficient proofs, and adds a concurrency\ncontrol mechanism for transactions. GlassDB batches independent operations from\nconcurrent transactions when updating the core data structures. In addition, we\ndesign a new benchmark for evaluating verifiable ledger databases, by extending\nYCSB and TPC-C benchmarks. Using this benchmark, we compare GlassDB against\nthree baselines: reimplemented versions of two verifiable databases, and a\nverifiable map backed by a transparency log. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat GlassDB is an efficient, transactional, and verifiable ledger database.",

    "abstract": "End-to-end speech-to-text translation models are often initialized with\npre-trained speech encoder and pre-trained text decoder. This leads to a\nsignificant training gap between pre-training and fine-tuning, largely due to\nthe modality differences between speech outputs from the encoder and text\ninputs to the decoder. In this work, we aim to bridge the modality gap between\nspeech and text to improve translation quality. We propose M-Adapter, a novel\nTransformer-based module, to adapt speech representations to text. While\nshrinking the speech sequence, M-Adapter produces features desired for\nspeech-to-text translation via modelling global and local dependencies of a\nspeech sequence. Our experimental results show that our model outperforms a\nstrong baseline by up to 1 BLEU score on the Must-C En$\\rightarrow$DE\ndataset.\\footnote{Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/mingzi151/w2v2-st.}",

    "abstract": "As the integration density and design intricacy of semiconductor wafers\nincrease, the magnitude and complexity of defects in them are also on the rise.\nSince the manual inspection of wafer defects is costly, an automated artificial\nintelligence (AI) based computer-vision approach is highly desired. The\nprevious works on defect analysis have several limitations, such as low\naccuracy and the need for separate models for classification and segmentation.\nFor analyzing mixed-type defects, some previous works require separately\ntraining one model for each defect type, which is non-scalable. In this paper,\nwe present WaferSegClassNet (WSCN), a novel network based on encoder-decoder\narchitecture. WSCN performs simultaneous classification and segmentation of\nboth single and mixed-type wafer defects. WSCN uses a \"shared encoder\" for\nclassification, and segmentation, which allows training WSCN end-to-end. We use\nN-pair contrastive loss to first pretrain the encoder and then use BCE-Dice\nloss for segmentation, and categorical cross-entropy loss for classification.\nUse of N-pair contrastive loss helps in better embedding representation in the\nlatent dimension of wafer maps. WSCN has a model size of only 0.51MB and\nperforms only 0.2M FLOPS. Thus, it is much lighter than other state-of-the-art\nmodels. Also, it requires only 150 epochs for convergence, compared to 4,000\nepochs needed by a previous work. We evaluate our model on the MixedWM38\ndataset, which has 38,015 images. WSCN achieves an average classification\naccuracy of 98.2% and a dice coefficient of 0.9999. We are the first to show\nsegmentation results on the MixedWM38 dataset.

The forming accuracy is seriously affected by the springback\nand other potential forming defects, of which the mechanism analysis is\ndifficult to deal with. At the same time, the existing methods are mainly\nconducted in offline space, ignoring the real-time information in the physical\nworld, which is unreliable and inefficient. To address this issue, a\ndigital-twin-enhanced (DT-enhanced) metal tube bending forming real-time\nprediction method based on multi-source-input multi-task learning (MTL) is\nproposed. The new method can achieve comprehensive MTBF real-time prediction.\nBy sharing the common feature of the multi-close domain and adopting group\nregularization strategy on feature sharing and accepting layers, the accuracy\nand efficiency of the multi-source-input MTL can be guaranteed. Enhanced by DT,\nthe physical real-time deformation data is aligned in the image dimension by an\nimproved Grammy Angle Field (GAF) conversion, realizing the reflection of the\nactual processing. Different from the traditional offline prediction methods,\nthe new method integrates the virtual and physical data to achieve a more\nefficient and accurate real-time prediction result. and the DT mapping\nconnection between virtual and physical systems can be achieved. To exclude the\neffects of equipment errors, the effectiveness of the proposed method is\nverified on the physical experiment-verified FE simulation scenarios.

However, for unsupervised low light\nenhancement, the remaining noise suppression issue due to the lacking of\nsupervision of detailed signal largely impedes the wide deployment of these\nmethods in real-world applications. Herein, we propose a novel\nCycle-Interactive Generative Adversarial Network (CIGAN) for unsupervised\nlow-light image enhancement, which is capable of not only better transferring\nillumination distributions between low/normal-light images but also\nmanipulating detailed signals between two domains, e.g.,\nsuppressing/synthesizing realistic noise in the cyclic enhancement/degradation\nprocess. In particular, the proposed low-light guided transformation\nfeed-forwards the features of low-light images from the generator of\nenhancement GAN (eGAN) into the generator of degradation GAN (dGAN). With the\nlearned information of real low-light images, dGAN can synthesize more\nrealistic diverse illumination and contrast in low-light images. Moreover, the\nfeature randomized perturbation module in dGAN learns to increase the feature\nrandomness to produce diverse feature distributions, persuading the synthesized\nlow-light images to contain realistic noise.

In this system, multiple ISAC devices perform radar sensing\nto obtain multi-view data, and then offload the quantized version of extracted\nfeatures to a centralized edge server, which conducts model inference based on\nthe cascaded feature vectors. Under this setup and by considering\nclassification tasks, we measure the inference accuracy by adopting an\napproximate but tractable metric, namely discriminant gain, which is defined as\nthe distance of two classes in the Euclidean feature space under normalized\ncovariance. To maximize the discriminant gain, we first quantify the influence\nof the sensing, computation, and communication processes on it with a derived\nclosed-form expression. Then, an end-to-end task-oriented resource management\napproach is developed by integrating the three processes into a joint design.\nThis integrated sensing, computation, and communication (ISCC) design approach,\nhowever, leads to a challenging non-convex optimization problem, due to the\ncomplicated form of discriminant gain and the device heterogeneity in terms of\nchannel gain, quantization level, and generated feature subsets. Remarkably,\nthe considered non-convex problem can be optimally solved based on the\nsum-of-ratios method. This gives the optimal ISCC scheme, that jointly\ndetermines the transmit power and time allocation at multiple devices for\nsensing and communication, as well as their quantization bits allocation for\ncomputation distortion control.

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose NARRATE, a novel pipeline that enables\nsimultaneously editing portrait lighting and perspective in a photorealistic\nmanner. As a hybrid neural-physical face model, NARRATE leverages complementary\nbenefits of geometry-aware generative approaches and normal-assisted physical\nface models. In a nutshell, NARRATE first inverts the input portrait to a\ncoarse geometry and employs neural rendering to generate images resembling the\ninput, as well as producing convincing pose changes. However, inversion step\nintroduces mismatch, bringing low-quality images with less facial details. As\nsuch, we further estimate portrait normal to enhance the coarse geometry,\ncreating a high-fidelity physical face model. In particular, we fuse the neural\nand physical renderings to compensate for the imperfect inversion, resulting in\nboth realistic and view-consistent novel perspective images. In relighting\nstage, previous works focus on single view portrait relighting but ignoring\nconsistency between different perspectives as well, leading unstable and\ninconsistent lighting effects for view changes. We extend Total Relighting to\nfix this problem by unifying its multi-view input normal maps with the physical\nface model. NARRATE conducts relighting with consistent normal maps, imposing\ncross-view constraints and exhibiting stable and coherent illumination effects.\nWe experimentally demonstrate that NARRATE achieves more photorealistic,\nreliable results over prior works. We further bridge NARRATE with animation and\nstyle transfer tools, supporting pose change, light change, facial animation,\nand style transfer, either separately or in combination, all at a photographic\nquality. We showcase vivid free-view facial animations as well as 3D-aware\nrelightable stylization, which help facilitate various AR/VR applications like\nvirtual cinematography, 3D video conferencing, and post-production.",

    "title": "Renaissance Robot: Optimal Transport Policy Fusion for Learning Diverse  Skills",
    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach to solving complex\nrobotics problems. However, the process of learning through trial-and-error\ninteractions is often highly time-consuming, despite recent advancements in RL\nalgorithms. Additionally, the success of RL is critically dependent on how well\nthe reward-shaping function suits the task, which is also time-consuming to\ndesign. As agents trained on a variety of robotics problems continue to\nproliferate, the ability to reuse their valuable learning for new domains\nbecomes increasingly significant. In this paper, we propose a post-hoc\ntechnique for policy fusion using Optimal Transport theory as a robust means of\nconsolidating the knowledge of multiple agents that have been trained on\ndistinct scenarios. We further demonstrate that this provides an improved\nweights initialisation of the neural network policy for learning new tasks,\nrequiring less time and computational resources than either retraining the\nparent policies or training a new policy from scratch. Ultimately, our results\non diverse agents commonly used in deep RL show that specialised knowledge can\nbe unified into a \"Renaissance agent\", allowing for quicker learning of new\nskills.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes methods of predicting dynamic time series (including\nnon-stationary ones) based on a linguistic approach, namely, the study of\noccurrences and repetition of so-called N-grams. This approach is used in\ncomputational linguistics to create statistical translators, detect plagiarism\nand duplicate documents. However, the scope of application can be extended\nbeyond linguistics by taking into account the correlations of sequences of\nstable word combinations, as well as trends. The proposed methods do not\nrequire a preliminary study and determination of the characteristics of time\nseries or complex tuning of the input parameters of the forecasting model. They\nallow, with a high level of automation, to carry out short-term and medium-term\nforecasts of time series, characterized by trends and cyclicality, in\nparticular, series of publication dynamics in content monitoring systems. Also,\nthe proposed methods can be used to predict the values of the parameters of a\nlarge complex system with the aim of monitoring its state, when the number of\nsuch parameters is significant, and therefore a high level of automation of the\nforecasting process is desirable. A significant advantage of the approach is\nthe absence of requirements for time series stationarity and a small number of\ntuning parameters. Further research may focus on the study of various criteria\nfor the similarity of time series fragments, the use of nonlinear similarity\ncriteria, the search for ways to automatically determine the rational step of\nquantization of the time series.",

    "abstract": "Neural Architecture Search (NAS) can automatically design architectures for\ndeep neural networks (DNNs) and has become one of the hottest research topics\nin the current machine learning community. However, NAS is often\ncomputationally expensive because a large number of DNNs require to be trained\nfor obtaining performance during the search process. Performance predictors can\ngreatly alleviate the prohibitive cost of NAS by directly predicting the\nperformance of DNNs. However, building satisfactory performance predictors\nhighly depends on enough trained DNN architectures, which are difficult to\nobtain in most scenarios. To solve this critical issue, we propose an effective\nDNN architecture augmentation method named GIAug in this paper. Specifically,\nwe first propose a mechanism based on graph isomorphism, which has the merit of\nefficiently generating a factorial of $\\boldsymbol n$ (i.e., $\\boldsymbol n!$)\ndiverse annotated architectures upon a single architecture having $\\boldsymbol\nn$ nodes. In addition, we also design a generic method to encode the\narchitectures into the form suitable to most prediction models. As a result,\nGIAug can be flexibly utilized by various existing performance predictors-based\nNAS algorithms. We perform extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet\nbenchmark datasets on small-, medium- and large-scale search space. The\nexperiments show that GIAug can significantly enhance the performance of most\nstate-of-the-art peer predictors.

Neural codecs trained considering only\nsource coding tend to be extremely sensitive to channel noises, especially in\nwireless channels with high error rate. In this paper, we investigate how to\nelevate the error resilience of neural audio codecs for packet losses that\noften occur during real-time communications. We propose a feature-domain packet\nloss concealment algorithm (FD-PLC) for real-time neural speech coding.\nSpecifically, we introduce a self-attention-based module on the received latent\nfeatures to recover lost frames in the feature domain before the decoder. A\nhybrid segment-level and frame-level frequency-domain discriminator is employed\nto guide the network to focus on both the generative quality of lost frames and\nthe continuity with neighbouring frames. Experimental results on several error\npatterns show that the proposed scheme can achieve better robustness compared\nwith the corresponding error-free and error-resilient baselines.

    "abstract": "The use of 3D cameras for gait analysis has been highly questioned due to the\nlow accuracy they have demonstrated in the past. The objective of the study\npresented in this paper is to improve the accuracy of the estimations made by\nrobot-mounted 3D cameras in human gait analysis by applying a supervised\nlearning stage. The 3D camera was mounted in a mobile robot to obtain a longer\nwalking distance. This study shows an improvement in detection of kinematic\ngait signals and gait descriptors by post-processing the raw estimations of the\ncamera using artificial neural networks trained with the data obtained from a\ncertified Vicon system. To achieve this, 37 healthy participants were recruited\nand data of 207 gait sequences were collected using an Orbbec Astra 3D camera.\nThere are two basic possible approaches for training: using kinematic gait\nsignals and using gait descriptors. The former seeks to improve the waveforms\nof kinematic gait signals by reducing the error and increasing the correlation\nwith respect to the Vicon system. The second is a more direct approach,\nfocusing on training the artificial neural networks using gait descriptors\ndirectly. The accuracy of the 3D camera was measured before and after training.\nIn both training approaches, an improvement was observed. Kinematic gait\nsignals showed lower errors and higher correlations with respect to the ground\ntruth. The accuracy of the system to detect gait descriptors also showed a\nsubstantial improvement, mostly for kinematic descriptors rather than\nspatio-temporal. When comparing both training approaches, it was not possible\nto define which was the absolute best. Therefore, we believe that the selection\nof the training approach will depend on the purpose of the study to be\nconducted. This study reveals the great potential of 3D cameras and encourages\nthe research community to continue exploring their use in gait analysis.",

    "abstract": "Background: Hackathons have become popular events for teams to collaborate on\nprojects and develop software prototypes. Most existing research focuses on\nactivities during an event with limited attention to the evolution of the\nhackathon code. Aim: We aim to understand the evolution of code used in and\ncreated during hackathon events, with a particular focus on the code blobs,\nspecifically, how frequently hackathon teams reuse pre-existing code, how much\nnew code they develop, if that code gets reused afterward, and what factors\naffect reuse. Method: We collected information about 22,183 hackathon projects\nfrom DevPost and obtained related code blobs, authors, project characteristics,\noriginal author, code creation time, language, and size information from World\nof Code. We tracked the reuse of code blobs by identifying all commits\ncontaining blobs created during hackathons and identifying all projects that\ncontain those commits. We also conducted a series of surveys in order to gain a\ndeeper understanding of hackathon code evolution that we sent out to hackathon\nparticipants whose code was reused, whose code was not reused, and developers\nwho reused some hackathon code. Result: 9.14% of the code blobs in hackathon\nrepositories and 8% of the lines of code (LOC) are created during hackathons\nand around a third of the hackathon code gets reused in other projects by both\nblob count and LOC. The number of associated technologies and the number of\nparticipants in hackathons increase the reuse probability. Conclusion: The\nresults of our study demonstrate hackathons are not always \"one-off\" events as\ncommon knowledge dictates and they can serve as a starting point for further\nstudies in this area.",

[IPEC 2014] presented an algorithmic\nmeta-theorem for reconfiguration problems that says if the feasibility can be\nexpressed in monadic second-order logic (MSO), then the problem is\nfixed-parameter tractable parameterized by $\\textrm{treewidth} + \\ell$, where\n$\\ell$ is the number of steps allowed to reach the target set. On the other\nhand, it is shown by Wrochna [J. Comput. Syst. Sci. 2018] that if $\\ell$ is not\npart of the parameter, then the problem is PSPACE-complete even on graphs of\nbounded bandwidth.\nIn this paper, we present the first algorithmic meta-theorems for the case\nwhere $\\ell$ is not part of the parameter, using some structural graph\nparameters incomparable with bandwidth. We show that if the feasibility is\ndefined in MSO, then the reconfiguration problem under the so-called token\njumping rule is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by neighborhood\ndiversity. We also show that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable\nparameterized by $\\textrm{treedepth} + k$, where $k$ is the size of sets being\ntransformed. We finally complement the positive result for treedepth by showing\nthat the problem is PSPACE-complete on forests of depth $3$.",

    "title": "Modeling and Control of Morphing Covers for the Adaptive Morphology of  Humanoid Robots",
    "abstract": "This article takes a step to provide humanoid robots with adaptive morphology\nabilities. We present a systematic approach for enabling robotic covers to\nmorph their shape, with an overall size fitting the anthropometric dimensions\nof a humanoid robot. More precisely, we present a cover concept consisting of\ntwo main components: a skeleton, which is a repetition of a basic element\ncalled node, and a soft membrane, which encloses the cover and deforms with its\nmotion. This article focuses on the cover skeleton and addresses the\nchallenging problems of node design, system modeling, motor positioning, and\ncontrol design of the morphing system. The cover modeling focuses on\nkinematics, and a systematic approach for defining the system kinematic\nconstraints is presented. Then, we apply genetic algorithms to find the motor\nlocations so that the morphing cover is fully actuated. Finally, we present\ncontrol algorithms that allow the cover to morph into a time-varying shape. The\nentire approach is validated by performing kinematic simulations with four\ndifferent covers of square dimensions and having 3x3, 4x8, 8x8, and 20x20\nnodes, respectively. For each cover, we apply the genetic algorithms to choose\nthe motor locations and perform simulations for tracking a desired shape. The\nsimulation results show that the presented approach ensures the covers to track\na desired shape with good tracking performances.",

    "abstract": "Community search is a problem that seeks cohesive and connected subgraphs in\na graph that satisfy certain topology constraints, e.g., degree constraints.\nThe majority of existing works focus exclusively on the topology and ignore the\nnodes' influence in the communities. To tackle this deficiency, influential\ncommunity search is further proposed to include the node's influence. Each node\nhas a weight, namely influence value, in the influential community search\nproblem to represent its network influence. The influence value of a community\nis produced by an aggregated function, e.g., max, min, avg, and sum, over the\ninfluence values of the nodes in the same community. The objective of the\ninfluential community search problem is to locate the top-r communities with\nthe highest influence values while satisfying the topology constraints.\nExisting studies on influential community search have several limitations: (i)\nthey focus exclusively on simple aggregation functions such as min, which may\nfall short of certain requirements in many real-world scenarios, and (ii) they\nimpose no limitation on the size of the community, whereas most real-world\nscenarios do. This motivates us to conduct a new study to fill this gap. We\nconsider the problem of identifying the top-r influential communities\nwith/without size constraints while using more complicated aggregation\nfunctions such as sum or avg. We give a theoretical analysis demonstrating the\nhardness of the problems and propose efficient and effective heuristic\nsolutions for our topr influential community search problems.

Furthermore, to optimize the memory prompt without\nundermining the stored knowledge, we propose a stimulation-based training\nstrategy.

    "abstract": "By holonomic guessing, we denote the process of finding a linear differential\nequation with polynomial coefficients satisfied by the generating function of a\nsequence, for which only a few first terms are known. Holonomic guessing has\nbeen used in computer algebra for over three decades to demonstrate the value\nof the guess-and-prove paradigm in intuition processes preceding proofs, as\npropagated in The Art of Solving (Polya, 1978). Among the prominent packages\nused to perform guessing, one can cite the Maple Gfun package of Salvy and\nZimmermann; the Mathematica GeneratingFunctions package of Mallinger; and the\nSage ore_algebra package of Kauers, Jaroschek, and Johansson.\nWe propose an approach that extends holonomic guessing by allowing the\ntargeted differential equations to be of degree at most two.

As a result, our software finds the correct\nrecurrence and differential equations for the generating functions of the\nup/down numbers (https://oeis.org/A000111), the evaluations of the zeta\nfunction at positive even integers, the Taylor coefficients of the Lambert W\nfunction, and many more.

Our approach allows the efficient\nsimulation of materials with complex underlying microstructures which reveal an\noverall anisotropic and nonlinear behavior on the macroscale. Thereby, we\nrestrict ourselves to finite strain hyperelasticity problems for now. By using\na set of problem specific invariants as the input of the ANN and the Helmholtz\nfree energy density as the output, several physical principles, e.g.,\nobjectivity, material symmetry, compatibility with the balance of angular\nmomentum and thermodynamic consistency are fulfilled a priori. The necessary\ndata for the training of the ANN-based surrogate model, i.e., macroscopic\ndeformations and corresponding stresses, are collected via computational\nhomogenization of representative volume elements (RVEs). Thereby, the core\nfeature of the approach is given by a completely autonomous mining of the\nrequired data set within an overall loop. In each iteration of the loop, new\ndata are generated by gathering the macroscopic deformation states from the\nmacroscopic finite element (FE) simulation and a subsequently sorting by using\nthe anisotropy class of the considered material. Finally, all unknown\ndeformations are prescribed in the RVE simulation to get the corresponding\nstresses and thus to extend the data set. The proposed framework consequently\nallows to reduce the number of time-consuming microscale simulations to a\nminimum.

Furthermore, we present two case-studies to\nhighlight the implicit assumptions underlying applied machine learning models\nthat tend to lead to errors when attempting to generalize beyond test benchmark\ndatasets.

In this work, we adjust neural processes (NPs) to the\nsemi-supervised image classification task, resulting in a new method named\nNP-Match. NP-Match is suited to this task for two reasons. Firstly, NP-Match\nimplicitly compares data points when making predictions, and as a result, the\nprediction of each unlabeled data point is affected by the labeled data points\nthat are similar to it, which improves the quality of pseudo-labels. Secondly,\nNP-Match is able to estimate uncertainty that can be used as a tool for\nselecting unlabeled samples with reliable pseudo-labels. Compared with\nuncertainty-based SSL methods implemented with Monte Carlo (MC) dropout,\nNP-Match estimates uncertainty with much less computational overhead, which can\nsave time at both the training and the testing phases. We conducted extensive\nexperiments on four public datasets, and NP-Match outperforms state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) results or achieves competitive results on them, which shows the\neffectiveness of NP-Match and its potential for SSL.",

Meanwhile, some recent\nworks discovered that an identical model for one modality can be used for\nanother modality with the help of cross modality transfer learning.

The unified model is\nuseful as we don't need to maintain separate models or weights for robotics,\nhence, it is more efficient. One application scenario of our unified system for\nrobotics can be: without any model architecture and model weights updating,\nrobotics can switch smoothly on using RGB camera or both RGB and Depth Sensor\nduring the day time and Depth sensor during the night time .\nExperiments on SUN RGB-D dataset show: Our unified model is not only\nefficient, but also has a similar or better performance in terms of mAP50 based\non SUNRGBD16 category: compare with the RGB only one, ours is slightly worse\n(52.3 $\\to$ 51.9). compare with the point cloud only one, we have similar\nperformance (52.7 $\\to$ 52.8); When using the novel inter modality mixing\nmethod proposed in this work, our model can achieve a significantly better\nperformance with 3.1 (52.7 $\\to$ 55.8) absolute improvement comparing with the\nprevious best result.

Based on\na crucial observation that skin disease images often exist multiple\nsub-clusters within a class (i.e., the appearances of images within one class\nof disease vary and form multiple distinct sub-groups), we design a novel\nSub-Cluster-Aware Network, namely SCAN, for rare skin disease diagnosis with\nenhanced accuracy. As the performance of few-shot learning highly depends on\nthe quality of the learned feature encoder, the main principle guiding the\ndesign of SCAN is the intrinsic sub-clustered representation learning for each\nclass so as to better describe feature distributions. Specifically, SCAN\nfollows a dual-branch framework, where the first branch is to learn class-wise\nfeatures to distinguish different skin diseases, and the second one aims to\nlearn features which can effectively partition each class into several groups\nso as to preserve the sub-clustered structure within each class. To achieve the\nobjective of the second branch, we present a cluster loss to learn image\nsimilarities via unsupervised clustering. To ensure that the samples in each\nsub-cluster are from the same class, we further design a purity loss to refine\nthe unsupervised clustering results. We evaluate the proposed approach on two\npublic datasets for few-shot skin disease classification.

However, the cost and effort of\nmanually creating a complete set of trace links across natural language\nartifacts such as requirements, design, and test-cases can be prohibitively\nexpensive. Researchers have therefore proposed automated link-generation\nsolutions primarily based on information-retrieval (IR) techniques; however,\nthese solutions have failed to deliver the accuracy needed for full adoption in\nindustrial projects. Improvements can be achieved using deep-learning\ntraceability models; however, their efficacy is impeded by the limited size and\navailability of project-level artifacts and links to serve as training data. In\nthis paper, we address this problem by proposing and evaluating several\ndeep-learning approaches for text-to-text traceability. Our method, named\nNLTrace, explores three transfer learning strategies that use datasets mined\nfrom open world platforms. Through pretraining Language Models (LMs) and\nleveraging adjacent tracing tasks, we demonstrate that NLTrace can\nsignificantly improve the performance of LM based trace models when training\nlinks are available. In such scenarios NLTrace outperforms the best performing\nclassical IR method with an 188% improvement in F2 score and 94.01% in Mean\nAverage Precision (MAP). It also outperforms the general LM based trace model\nby 7% and 23% for F2 and MAP respectively. In addition, NLTrace can adapt to\nlow-resource tracing scenarios where other LM models can not.

    "abstract": "FasterAI is a PyTorch-based library, aiming to facilitate the utilization of\ndeep neural networks compression techniques such as sparsification, pruning,\nknowledge distillation, or regularization. The library is built with the\npurpose of enabling quick implementation and experimentation. More\nparticularly, compression techniques are leveraging Callback systems of\nlibraries such as fastai and Pytorch Lightning to bring a user-friendly and\nhigh-level API. The main asset of FasterAI is its lightweight, yet powerful,\nsimplicity of use. Indeed, because it was developed in a very granular way,\nusers can create thousands of unique experiments by using different\ncombinations of parameters. In this paper, we focus on the sparsifying\ncapabilities of FasterAI, which represents the core of the library. Performing\nsparsification of a neural network in FasterAI only requires a single\nadditional line of code in the traditional training loop, yet allows to perform\nstate-of-the-art techniques such as Lottery Ticket Hypothesis experiments",

    "abstract": "While constructing polar codes for successive-cancellation decoding can be\nimplemented efficiently by sorting the bit-channels, finding optimal polar-code\nconstructions for the successive-cancellation list (SCL) decoding in an\nefficient and scalable manner still awaits investigation. This paper proposes a\ngraph neural network (GNN)-based reinforcement learning algorithm, named the\niterative message-passing (IMP) algorithm, to solve the polar-code construction\nproblem for SCL decoding. The algorithm operates only on the local structure of\nthe graph induced by polar-code's generator matrix. The size of the IMP model\nis independent of the blocklength and the code rate, making it scalable to\nconstruct polar codes with long blocklengths. Moreover, a single trained IMP\nmodel can be directly applied to a wide range of target blocklengths, code\nrates, and channel conditions, and corresponding polar codes can be generated\nwithout separate training. Numerical experiments show that the IMP algorithm\nfinds polar-code constructions that significantly outperform the classical\nconstructions under cyclic-redundancy-check-aided SCL (CA-SCL) decoding.\nCompared to other learning-based construction methods tailored to SCL/CA-SCL\ndecoding, the IMP algorithm constructs polar codes with comparable or lower\nframe error rates, while reducing the training complexity significantly by\neliminating the need of separate training at each target blocklength, code\nrate, and channel condition.",

Due to the unavailability of anomalous data,\ntraining a supervised deep neural network is a cumbersome task. As such,\nunsupervised methods are preferred as a common approach to solve this task.\nDeep autoencoders have been broadly adopted as a base of many unsupervised\nanomaly detection methods. However, a notable shortcoming of deep autoencoders\nis that they provide insufficient representations for anomaly detection by\ngeneralizing to reconstruct outliers. In this work, we have designed an\nadversarial framework consisting of two competing components, an Adversarial\nDistorter, and an Autoencoder. The Adversarial Distorter is a convolutional\nencoder that learns to produce effective perturbations and the autoencoder is a\ndeep convolutional neural network that aims to reconstruct the images from the\nperturbed latent feature space. The networks are trained with opposing goals in\nwhich the Adversarial Distorter produces perturbations that are applied to the\nencoder's latent feature space to maximize the reconstruction error and the\nautoencoder tries to neutralize the effect of these perturbations to minimize\nit. When applied to anomaly detection, the proposed method learns semantically\nricher representations due to applying perturbations to the feature space.

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection is to recognize samples that differ in some respect from\nthe training observations. These samples which do not conform to the\ndistribution of normal data are called outliers or anomalies. In real-world\nanomaly detection problems, the outliers are absent, not well defined, or have\na very limited number of instances. Recent state-of-the-art deep learning-based\nanomaly detection methods suffer from high computational cost, complexity,\nunstable training procedures, and non-trivial implementation, making them\ndifficult to deploy in real-world applications. To combat this problem, we\nleverage a simple learning procedure that trains a lightweight convolutional\nneural network, reaching state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection. In\nthis paper, we propose to solve anomaly detection as a supervised regression\nproblem. We label normal and anomalous data using two separable distributions\nof continuous values. To compensate for the unavailability of anomalous samples\nduring training time, we utilize straightforward image augmentation techniques\nto create a distinct set of samples as anomalies. The distribution of the\naugmented set is similar but slightly deviated from the normal data, whereas\nreal anomalies are expected to have an even further distribution. Therefore,\ntraining a regressor on these augmented samples will result in more separable\ndistributions of labels for normal and real anomalous data points. Anomaly\ndetection experiments on image and video datasets show the superiority of the\nproposed method over the state-of-the-art approaches.",

We\nidentified 553 papers relevant for our review retrieved from 5 different\ndatabases. The final sample of reviewed papers included 35 papers written\nbetween 2005 and 2021, which involved a total of 3902 participants. In this\narticle, we thoroughly summarize these papers by reporting information about\ntheir objectives and assumptions on gender (i.e., definitions and reasons to\nmanipulate gender), their manipulation of robot's \"gender\" (i.e., gender cues\nand manipulation checks), their experimental designs (e.g., demographics of\nparticipants, employed robots), and their results (i.e., main and interaction\neffects). The review reveals that robot's \"gender\" does not affect crucial\nconstructs for the HRI, such as likability and acceptance, but rather bears its\nstrongest effect on stereotyping.

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on perceiving and navigating 3D environments using echoes\nand RGB image. In particular, we perform depth estimation by fusing RGB image\nwith echoes, received from multiple orientations. Unlike previous works, we go\nbeyond the field of view of the RGB and estimate dense depth maps for\nsubstantially larger parts of the environment. We show that the echoes provide\nholistic and in-expensive information about the 3D structures complementing the\nRGB image. Moreover, we study how echoes and the wide field-of-view depth maps\ncan be utilised in robot navigation. We compare the proposed methods against\nrecent baselines using two sets of challenging realistic 3D environments:\nReplica and Matterport3D.

    "abstract": "Managing discount promotional events (\"markdown\") is a significant part of\nrunning an e-commerce business, and inefficiencies here can significantly\nhamper a retailer's profitability. Traditional approaches for tackling this\nproblem rely heavily on price elasticity modelling. However, the partial\ninformation nature of price elasticity modelling, together with the\nnon-negotiable responsibility for protecting profitability, mean that machine\nlearning practitioners must often go through great lengths to define strategies\nfor measuring offline model quality. In the face of this, many retailers fall\nback on rule-based methods, thus forgoing significant gains in profitability\nthat can be captured by machine learning. In this paper, we introduce two novel\nend-to-end markdown management systems for optimising markdown at different\nstages of a retailer's journey. The first system, \"Ithax\", enacts a rational\nsupply-side pricing strategy without demand estimation, and can be usefully\ndeployed as a \"cold start\" solution to collect markdown data while maintaining\nrevenue control. The second system, \"Promotheus\", presents a full framework for\nmarkdown optimization with price elasticity. We describe in detail the specific\nmodelling and validation procedures that, within our experience, have been\ncrucial to building a system that performs robustly in the real world. Both\nmarkdown systems achieve superior profitability compared to decisions made by\nour experienced operations teams in a controlled online test, with improvements\nof 86% (Promotheus) and 79% (Ithax) relative to manual strategies. These\nsystems have been deployed to manage markdown at ASOS.com, and both systems can\nbe fruitfully deployed for price optimization across a wide variety of retail\ne-commerce settings.",

In the previous runs\nof this Competition, the Challenges targeted Valence-Arousal Estimation,\nExpression Classification and Action Unit Detection. This year the Competition\nencompasses two different Challenges: i) a Multi-Task-Learning one in which the\ngoal is to learn at the same time (i.e., in a multi-task learning setting) all\nthe three above mentioned tasks; and ii) a Learning from Synthetic Data one in\nwhich the goal is to learn to recognise the basic expressions from artificially\ngenerated data and generalise to real data. The Aff-Wild2 database is a large\nscale in-the-wild database and the first one that contains annotations for\nvalence and arousal, expressions and action units. This database is the basis\nfor the above Challenges. In more detail: i) s-Aff-Wild2 -- a static version of\nAff-Wild2 database -- has been constructed and utilized for the purposes of the\nMulti-Task-Learning Challenge; and ii) some specific frames-images from the\nAff-Wild2 database have been used in an expression manipulation manner for\ncreating the synthetic dataset, which is the basis for the Learning from\nSynthetic Data Challenge. In this paper, at first we present the two\nChallenges, along with the utilized corpora, then we outline the evaluation\nmetrics and finally present the baseline systems per Challenge, as well as\ntheir derived results.

Yet, despite their popularity, little has been done to understand\nwhich elements to be included into the memory.

We\npropose a generalized spectral coarsening method that considers multiple\nLaplacian operators of possibly different dimensionalities in tandem.

It reveals the\nvulnerability of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as state-of-the-art\nbuilding block for face recognition models against adversarial examples, which\ncan cause certain consequences for secure systems. Gradient-based adversarial\nattacks are widely studied before and proved to be successful against face\nrecognition models.

Instead of a random face warping procedure, the warping\nfunctions are applied on specific detected regions of face like eyebrows, nose,\nlips, etc. We evaluate the robustness of proposed method in the decision-based\nblack-box attack setting, where the attackers have no access to the model\nparameters and gradients, but hard-label predictions and confidence scores are\nprovided by the target model.",

In this paper, we propose the first\ndata-driven computational model that addresses the search-termination problem\nand predicts the scanpath of search fixations made by people searching for\ntargets that do not appear in images. We model visual search as an imitation\nlearning problem and represent the internal knowledge that the viewer acquires\nthrough fixations using a novel state representation that we call Foveated\nFeature Maps (FFMs). FFMs integrate a simulated foveated retina into a\npretrained ConvNet that produces an in-network feature pyramid, all with\nminimal computational overhead. Our method integrates FFMs as the state\nrepresentation in inverse reinforcement learning.

    "abstract": "Vehicle platoon often face the problem of lack of scalability of maneuvers in\npractical applications. Once a new scenario is added, the original program may\nno longer be available. To deal with this problem, this paper introduces a\ntwo-dimensional maneuver management framework with a fault-tolerant mechanism\non the basis of the proposed hierarchical architecture for the platoon control\nsystem. Maneuvers and roles are two dimensions, based on which the management\nstrategies are decoupled. This makes each vehicle in the platoon has the\nability to execute management strategies of various maneuvers and the new\nmaneuver could be extended without revising the existing part. The\nfault-tolerant mechanism is designed as a maneuver triggered by hardware\nfailures to keep safe before taking over. Furthermore, three typical maneuvers\nare selected for case studies to illustrate how the management strategies in\nthis framework work. Finally, a comprehensive simulation scenario integrating\ndifferent maneuvers is designed and a real-world implementation using\nmicro-vehicles is conducted. Results show that the propose two-dimensional\nframework could effectively deal with various maneuvers and satisfy the\ncomputational real-time requirements",

Existing fairness-aware machine learning methods mainly focus on the\nfairness of in-distribution data. However, in real-world applications, it is\ncommon to have distribution shift between the training and test data. In this\npaper, we first show that the fairness achieved by existing methods can be\neasily broken by slight distribution shifts. To solve this problem, we propose\na novel fairness learning method termed CUrvature MAtching (CUMA), which can\nachieve robust fairness generalizable to unseen domains with unknown\ndistributional shifts. Specifically, CUMA enforces the model to have similar\ngeneralization ability on the majority and minority groups, by matching the\nloss curvature distributions of the two groups. We evaluate our method on three\npopular fairness datasets.

In\nthis paper, we propose a Transformer-based asymmetric network (TANet) to tackle\nthe issues mentioned above.

Both of them work well, while\nadversarial training shows its advantage by avoiding some limitations of\ncontrastive learning. Compared with previous research, our solution\ndemonstrates clear improvement on experimental metrics without additional\ncomplexity. Further analysis reveals the validity of the proposed architecture\nand its good potential for future extension.",

    "abstract": "Cross-speaker emotion transfer speech synthesis aims to synthesize emotional\nspeech for a target speaker by transferring the emotion from reference speech\nrecorded by another (source) speaker. In this task, extracting\nspeaker-independent emotion embedding from reference speech plays an important\nrole. However, the emotional information conveyed by such emotion embedding\ntends to be weakened in the process to squeeze out the source speaker's timbre\ninformation. In response to this problem, a prosody compensation module (PCM)\nis proposed in this paper to compensate for the emotional information loss.\nSpecifically, the PCM tries to obtain speaker-independent emotional information\nfrom the intermediate feature of a pre-trained ASR model. To this end, a\nprosody compensation encoder with global context (GC) blocks is introduced to\nobtain global emotional information from the ASR model's intermediate feature.\nExperiments demonstrate that the proposed PCM can effectively compensate the\nemotion embedding for the emotional information loss, and meanwhile maintain\nthe timbre of the target speaker. Comparisons with state-of-the-art models show\nthat our proposed method presents obvious superiority on the cross-speaker\nemotion transfer task.",

    "abstract": "With the emergence of GAN, face forgery technologies have been heavily\nabused. Achieving accurate face forgery detection is imminent. Inspired by\nremote photoplethysmography (rPPG) that PPG signal corresponds to the periodic\nchange of skin color caused by heartbeat in face videos, we observe that\ndespite the inevitable loss of PPG signal during the forgery process, there is\nstill a mixture of PPG signals in the forgery video with a unique rhythmic\npattern depending on its generation method. Motivated by this key observation,\nwe propose a framework for face forgery detection and categorization consisting\nof: 1) a Spatial-Temporal Filtering Network (STFNet) for PPG signals filtering,\nand 2) a Spatial-Temporal Interaction Network (STINet) for constraint and\ninteraction of PPG signals. Moreover, with insight into the generation of\nforgery methods, we further propose intra-source and inter-source blending to\nboost the performance of the framework.

    "abstract": "Deep learning has become a powerful tool for Mars exploration. Mars terrain\nsegmentation is an important Martian vision task, which is the base of rover\nautonomous planning and safe driving. However, existing deep-learning-based\nterrain segmentation methods face two problems: one is the lack of sufficient\ndetailed and high-confidence annotations, and the other is the over-reliance of\nmodels on annotated training data. In this paper, we address these two problems\nfrom the perspective of joint data and method design. We first present a new\nMars terrain segmentation dataset which contains 6K high-resolution images and\nis sparsely annotated based on confidence, ensuring the high quality of labels.\nThen to learn from this sparse data, we propose a representation-learning-based\nframework for Mars terrain segmentation, including a self-supervised learning\nstage (for pre-training) and a semi-supervised learning stage (for\nfine-tuning). Specifically, for self-supervised learning, we design a\nmulti-task mechanism based on the masked image modeling (MIM) concept to\nemphasize the texture information of images. For semi-supervised learning,\nsince our dataset is sparsely annotated, we encourage the model to excavate the\ninformation of unlabeled area in each image by generating and utilizing\npseudo-labels online. We name our dataset and method Self-Supervised and\nSemi-Supervised Segmentation for Mars (S$^{5}$Mars). Experimental results show\nthat our method can outperform state-of-the-art approaches and improve terrain\nsegmentation performance by a large margin.",

This paper formally explores\nthe effect of these ranking axioms on the numerical values of some IR\nevaluation metrics. It focuses on the set of ranked lists of documents with\nmultigrade relevance. The possible orderings in this set are derived from three\ncommonly accepted ranking axioms on retrieval metrics; then, they are\nclassified by their latticial properties. When relevant documents are\nprioritised, a subset of document rankings are identified: the join-irreducible\nelements, which have some resemblance to the concept of basis in vector space.\nIt is possible to compute the precision, recall, RBP or DCG values of any\nranking from their values in the join-irreducible elements.

    "abstract": "Referring video object segmentation (R-VOS) aims to segment the object masks\nin a video given a referring linguistic expression to the object. It is a\nrecently introduced task attracting growing research attention. However, all\nexisting works make a strong assumption: The object depicted by the expression\nmust exist in the video, namely, the expression and video must have an\nobject-level semantic consensus. This is often violated in real-world\napplications where an expression can be queried to false videos, and existing\nmethods always fail in such false queries due to abusing the assumption. In\nthis work, we emphasize that studying semantic consensus is necessary to\nimprove the robustness of R-VOS. Accordingly, we pose an extended task from\nR-VOS without the semantic consensus assumption, named Robust R-VOS\n($\\mathrm{R}^2$-VOS). The $\\mathrm{R}^2$-VOS task is essentially related to the\njoint modeling of the primary R-VOS task and its dual problem (text\nreconstruction). We embrace the observation that the embedding spaces have\nrelational consistency through the cycle of text-video-text transformation,\nwhich connects the primary and dual problems. We leverage the cycle consistency\nto discriminate the semantic consensus, thus advancing the primary task.\nParallel optimization of the primary and dual problems are enabled by\nintroducing an early grounding medium. A new evaluation dataset,\n$\\mathrm{R}^2$-Youtube-VOS, is collected to measure the robustness of R-VOS\nmodels against unpaired videos and expressions. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our method not only identifies negative pairs of unrelated\nexpressions and videos, but also improves the segmentation accuracy for\npositive pairs with a superior disambiguating ability. Our model achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance on Ref-DAVIS17, Ref-Youtube-VOS, and the novel\n$\\mathrm{R}^2$-Youtube-VOS dataset.",

    "abstract": "Existing benchmarks for grounding language in interactive environments either\nlack real-world linguistic elements, or prove difficult to scale up due to\nsubstantial human involvement in the collection of data or feedback signals. To\nbridge this gap, we develop WebShop -- a simulated e-commerce website\nenvironment with $1.18$ million real-world products and $12,087$ crowd-sourced\ntext instructions. Given a text instruction specifying a product requirement,\nan agent needs to navigate multiple types of webpages and issue diverse actions\nto find, customize, and purchase an item. WebShop provides several challenges\nfor language grounding including understanding compositional instructions,\nquery (re-)formulation, comprehending and acting on noisy text in webpages, and\nperforming strategic exploration. We collect over $1,600$ human demonstrations\nfor the task, and train and evaluate a diverse range of agents using\nreinforcement learning, imitation learning, and pre-trained image and language\nmodels. Our best model achieves a task success rate of $29\\%$, which\noutperforms rule-based heuristics ($9.6\\%$) but is far lower than human expert\nperformance ($59\\%$). We also analyze agent and human trajectories and ablate\nvarious model components to provide insights for developing future agents with\nstronger language understanding and decision making abilities.

In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel fined-grained knowledge graph structure called an attributed\nabnormality graph (ATAG). The ATAG consists of interconnected abnormality nodes\nand attribute nodes, allowing it to better capture the abnormality details. In\ncontrast to the existing methods where the abnormality graph was constructed\nmanually, we propose a methodology to automatically construct the fine-grained\ngraph structure based on annotations, medical reports in X-ray datasets, and\nthe RadLex radiology lexicon. We then learn the ATAG embedding using a deep\nmodel with an encoder-decoder architecture for the report generation. In\nparticular, graph attention networks are explored to encode the relationships\namong the abnormalities and their attributes. A gating mechanism is adopted and\nintegrated with various decoders for the generation.

Our motion segmentation\nguided HDR fusion approach offers significant advantages over existing HDR\ndeghosting methods.

The proposed method outperforms nine existing\nstate-of-the-art methods on two publicly available datasets and generates\nvisually pleasing ghost-free HDR results.

    "abstract": "Besides improving communication performance, intelligent reflecting surfaces\n(IRSs) are also promising enablers for achieving larger sensing coverage and\nenhanced sensing quality. Nevertheless, in the absence of a direct path between\nthe base station (BS) and the targets, multi-target sensing is generally very\ndifficult, since IRSs are incapable of proactively transmitting sensing beams\nor analyzing target information. Moreover, the echoes of different targets\nreflected via the IRS-established virtual links share the same directionality\nat the BS. In this paper, we study a wireless system comprising a multi-antenna\nBS and an IRS for multi-target sensing, where the beamforming vector and the\nIRS phase shifts are jointly optimized to improve the sensing performance. To\nmeet the different sensing requirements, such as a minimum received power and a\nminimum sensing frequency, we propose three novel IRS-assisted sensing schemes:\nTime division (TD) sensing, signature sequence (SS) sensing, and hybrid TD-SS\nsensing. First, for TD sensing, the sensing tasks are performed in sequence\nover time. Subsequently, a novel signature sequence (SS) sensing scheme is\nproposed to improve sensing efficiency by establishing a relationship between\ndirections and SSs. To strike a flexible balance between the beam pattern gain\nand sensing efficiency, we also propose a general hybrid TD-SS sensing scheme\nwith target grouping, where targets belonging to the same group are sensed\nsimultaneously via SS sensing, while the targets in different groups are\nassigned to orthogonal time slots. By controlling the number of groups, the\nhybrid TD-SS sensing scheme can provide a more flexible balance between beam\npattern gain and sensing frequency. Moreover, ...",

In\nthis paper, we focus on scaling up the Oracle Approximate Vanishing Ideal\nalgorithm (OAVI), one of the most powerful of these methods. We prove that the\ncomputational complexity of OAVI is not superlinear but linear in the number of\nsamples $m$ and polynomial in the number of features $n$, making OAVI an\nattractive preprocessing technique for large-scale machine learning. To further\naccelerate OAVI's training time, we propose two changes: First, as the name\nsuggests, OAVI makes repeated oracle calls to convex solvers throughout its\nexecution. By replacing the Pairwise Conditional Gradients algorithm, one of\nthe standard solvers used in OAVI, with the faster Blended Pairwise Conditional\nGradients algorithm, we illustrate how OAVI directly benefits from advancements\nin the study of convex solvers. Second, we propose Inverse Hessian Boosting\n(IHB): IHB exploits the fact that OAVI repeatedly solves quadratic convex\noptimization problems that differ only by very little and whose solutions can\nbe written in closed form using inverse Hessian information. By efficiently\nupdating the inverse of the Hessian matrix, the convex optimization problems\ncan be solved almost instantly, accelerating OAVI's training time by up to\nmultiple orders of magnitude.

In this paper, from an alternate perspective to overcome the above\nchallenges, we unite these two tasks into one task by a new form of predicting\nshots link: a link connects two adjacent shots, indicating that they belong to\nthe same scene or category. To the end, we propose a general One Stage\nMultimodal Sequential Link Framework (OS-MSL) to both distinguish and leverage\nthe two-fold semantics by reforming the two learning tasks into a unified one.\nFurthermore, we tailor a specific module called DiffCorrNet to explicitly\nextract the information of differences and correlations among shots.

In this work, we review\nthe existing definitions for uncertainty calibration of probabilistic\nregression tasks. We inspect the calibration properties of common detection\nnetworks and extend state-of-the-art recalibration methods. Our methods use a\nGaussian process (GP) recalibration scheme that yields parametric distributions\nas output (e.g. Gaussian or Cauchy). The usage of GP recalibration allows for a\nlocal (conditional) uncertainty calibration by capturing dependencies between\nneighboring samples. The use of parametric distributions such as as Gaussian\nallows for a simplified adaption of calibration in subsequent processes, e.g.,\nfor Kalman filtering in the scope of object tracking.\nIn addition, we use the GP recalibration scheme to perform covariance\nestimation which allows for post-hoc introduction of local correlations between\nthe output quantities, e.g., position, width, or height in object detection. To\nmeasure the joint calibration of multivariate and possibly correlated data, we\nintroduce the quantile calibration error which is based on the Mahalanobis\ndistance between the predicted distribution and the ground truth to determine\nwhether the ground truth is within a predicted quantile.\nOur experiments show that common detection models overestimate the spatial\nuncertainty in comparison to the observed error. We show that the simple\nIsotonic Regression recalibration method is sufficient to achieve a good\nuncertainty quantification in terms of calibrated quantiles. In contrast, if\nnormal distributions are required for subsequent processes, our GP-Normal\nrecalibration method yields the best results.

In contrast to the\nexisting works that considered active or passive IRS only, we propose in this\npaper a new hybrid active-passive IRS architecture that consists of both active\nand passive reflecting elements, thus achieving their combined advantages\nflexibly. Under a practical channel setup with Rician fading where only the\nstatistical channel state information (CSI) is available, we study the hybrid\nIRS design in a multi-user communication system. Specifically, we formulate an\noptimization problem to maximize the achievable ergodic capacity of the\nworst-case user by designing the hybrid IRS beamforming and active/passive\nelements allocation based on the statistical CSI, subject to various practical\nconstraints on the active-element amplification factor and amplification power\nconsumption, as well as the total active and passive elements deployment\nbudget. To solve this challenging problem, we first approximate the ergodic\ncapacity in a simpler form and then propose an efficient algorithm to solve the\nproblem optimally. Moreover, we show that for the special case with all\nchannels to be line-of-sight (LoS), only active elements need to be deployed\nwhen the total deployment budget is sufficiently small, while both active and\npassive elements should be deployed with a decreasing number ratio when the\nbudget increases and exceeds a certain threshold.

We propose to leverage the flexibility of neural networks\nto learn an approximate optimal transport map. More precisely, we present a new\nand original method to address the problem of transporting a finite set of\nsamples associated with a first underlying unknown distribution towards another\nfinite set of samples drawn from another unknown distribution. We show that a\nparticular instance of invertible neural networks, namely the normalizing\nflows, can be used to approximate the solution of this OT problem between a\npair of empirical distributions. To this aim, we propose to relax the Monge\nformulation of OT by replacing the equality constraint on the push-forward\nmeasure by the minimization of the corresponding Wasserstein distance. The\npush-forward operator to be retrieved is then restricted to be a normalizing\nflow which is trained by optimizing the resulting cost function. This approach\nallows the transport map to be discretized as a composition of functions. Each\nof these functions is associated to one sub-flow of the network, whose output\nprovides intermediate steps of the transport between the original and target\nmeasures. This discretization yields also a set of intermediate barycenters\nbetween the two measures of interest.

Due to the resource constraints of\nmobile devices, researchers have focused on either making a lightweight deep\nneural network (DNN) model using model pruning or generating an efficient code\nusing compiler optimization. Surprisingly, we found that the straightforward\nintegration between model compression and compiler auto-tuning often does not\nproduce the most efficient model for a target device.

    "abstract": "Speech command recognition (SCR) has been commonly used on resource\nconstrained devices to achieve hands-free user experience. However, in real\napplications, confusion among commands with similar pronunciations often\nhappens due to the limited capacity of small models deployed on edge devices,\nwhich drastically affects the user experience. In this paper, inspired by the\nadvances of discriminative training in speech recognition, we propose a novel\nminimize sequential confusion error (MSCE) training criterion particularly for\nSCR, aiming to alleviate the command confusion problem. Specifically, we aim to\nimprove the ability of discriminating the target command from other commands on\nthe basis of MCE discriminative criteria. We define the likelihood of different\ncommands through connectionist temporal classification (CTC). During training,\nwe propose several strategies to use prior knowledge creating a confusing\nsequence set for similar-sounding command instead of creating the whole\nnon-target command set, which can better save the training resources and\neffectively reduce command confusion errors. Specifically, we design and\ncompare three different strategies for confusing set construction. By using our\nproposed method, we can relatively reduce the False Reject Rate~(FRR) by 33.7%\nat 0.01 False Alarm Rate~(FAR) and confusion errors by 18.28% on our collected\nspeech command set.",

    "abstract": "Customized keyword spotting (KWS) has great potential to be deployed on edge\ndevices to achieve hands-free user experience. However, in real applications,\nfalse alarm (FA) would be a serious problem for spotting dozens or even\nhundreds of keywords, which drastically affects user experience. To solve this\nproblem, in this paper, we leverage the recent advances in transducer and\ntransformer based acoustic models and propose a new multi-stage customized KWS\nframework named Cascaded Transducer-Transformer KWS (CaTT-KWS), which includes\na transducer based keyword detector, a frame-level phone predictor based force\nalignment module and a transformer based decoder. Specifically, the streaming\ntransducer module is used to spot keyword candidates in audio stream. Then\nforce alignment is implemented using the phone posteriors predicted by the\nphone predictor to finish the first stage keyword verification and refine the\ntime boundaries of keyword. Finally, the transformer decoder further verifies\nthe triggered keyword. Our proposed CaTT-KWS framework reduces FA rate\neffectively without obviously hurting keyword recognition accuracy.\nSpecifically, we can get impressively 0.13 FA per hour on a challenging\ndataset, with over 90% relative reduction on FA comparing to the transducer\nbased detection model, while keyword recognition accuracy only drops less than\n2%.",

    "abstract": "Recently, deep learning methods have made great progress in traffic\nprediction, but their performance depends on a large amount of historical data.\nIn reality, we may face the data scarcity issue. In this case, deep learning\nmodels fail to obtain satisfactory performance. Transfer learning is a\npromising approach to solve the data scarcity issue. However, existing transfer\nlearning approaches in traffic prediction are mainly based on regular grid\ndata, which is not suitable for the inherent graph data in the traffic network.\nMoreover, existing graph-based models can only capture shared traffic patterns\nin the road network, and how to learn node-specific patterns is also a\nchallenge. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning approach to\nsolve the traffic prediction with few data, which can transfer the knowledge\nlearned from a data-rich source domain to a data-scarce target domain. First, a\nspatial-temporal graph neural network is proposed, which can capture the\nnode-specific spatial-temporal traffic patterns of different road networks.\nThen, to improve the robustness of transfer, we design a pattern-based transfer\nstrategy, where we leverage a clustering-based mechanism to distill common\nspatial-temporal patterns in the source domain, and use these knowledge to\nfurther improve the prediction performance of the target domain. Experiments on\nreal-world datasets verify the effectiveness of our approach.",

    "abstract": "Skew polynomials are a class of non-commutative polynomials that have several\napplications in computer science, coding theory and cryptography. In\nparticular, skew polynomials can be used to construct and decode evaluation\ncodes in several metrics, like e.g. the Hamming, rank, sum-rank and skew\nmetric.

    "abstract": "Recent works on image harmonization solve the problem as a pixel-wise image\ntranslation task via large autoencoders. They have unsatisfactory performances\nand slow inference speeds when dealing with high-resolution images. In this\nwork, we observe that adjusting the input arguments of basic image filters,\ne.g., brightness and contrast, is sufficient for humans to produce realistic\nimages from the composite ones. Hence, we frame image harmonization as an\nimage-level regression problem to learn the arguments of the filters that\nhumans use for the task. We present a Harmonizer framework for image\nharmonization. Unlike prior methods that are based on black-box autoencoders,\nHarmonizer contains a neural network for filter argument prediction and several\nwhite-box filters (based on the predicted arguments) for image harmonization.\nWe also introduce a cascade regressor and a dynamic loss strategy for\nHarmonizer to learn filter arguments more stably and precisely. Since our\nnetwork only outputs image-level arguments and the filters we used are\nefficient, Harmonizer is much lighter and faster than existing methods.\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate that Harmonizer surpasses existing\nmethods notably, especially with high-resolution inputs. Finally, we apply\nHarmonizer to video harmonization, which achieves consistent results across\nframes and 56 fps at 1080P resolution.

The creation\nof such treebanks is enormously labor-intensive and time-consuming. Especially\nwhen the size of treebanks is considered, tools that support the annotation\nprocess are essential. Various annotation tools have been proposed, however,\nthey are often not suitable for agglutinative languages such as Turkish.

The main objectives of the tool are to:\n(1) support creating valid and consistent annotations with increased speed, (2)\nsignificantly improve the user experience of the annotator, (3) support\ncollaboration among annotators, and (4) provide an open-source and easily\ndeployable web-based annotation tool with a flexible application programming\ninterface (API) to benefit the scientific community.

    "abstract": "Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to predict unseen classes whose samples have\nnever appeared during training, often utilizing additional semantic information\n(a.k.a. side information) to bridge the training (seen) classes and the unseen\nclasses. One of the most effective and widely used semantic information for\nzero-shot image classification are attributes which are annotations for\nclass-level visual characteristics. However, due to the shortage of\nfine-grained annotations, the attribute imbalance and co-occurrence, the\ncurrent methods often fail to discriminate those subtle visual distinctions\nbetween images, which limits their performances. In this paper, we present a\ntransformer-based end-to-end ZSL method named DUET, which integrates latent\nsemantic knowledge from the pretrained language models (PLMs) via a\nself-supervised multi-modal learning paradigm. Specifically, we (1) developed a\ncross-modal semantic grounding network to investigate the model's capability of\ndisentangling semantic attributes from the images, (2) applied an\nattribute-level contrastive learning strategy to further enhance the model's\ndiscrimination on fine-grained visual characteristics against the attribute\nco-occurrence and imbalance, and (3) proposed a multi-task learning policy for\nconsidering multi-model objectives.

To address these issues, we\npresent an add-on module called dual image-adaptive learnable filters\n(DIAL-Filters) to improve the semantic segmentation in nighttime driving\nconditions, aiming at exploiting the intrinsic features of driving-scene images\nunder different illuminations. DIAL-Filters consist of two parts, including an\nimage-adaptive processing module (IAPM) and a learnable guided filter (LGF).\nWith DIAL-Filters, we design both unsupervised and supervised frameworks for\nnighttime driving-scene segmentation, which can be trained in an end-to-end\nmanner. Specifically, the IAPM module consists of a small convolutional neural\nnetwork with a set of differentiable image filters, where each image can be\nadaptively enhanced for better segmentation with respect to the different\nilluminations. The LGF is employed to enhance the output of segmentation\nnetwork to get the final segmentation result. The DIAL-Filters are light-weight\nand efficient and they can be readily applied for both daytime and nighttime\nimages.

We show that there are quantitative\ndifferences between the coins (cryptocurrencies operating on their own\nindependent network) and tokens (which operate on top of a smart contract\nplatform). Presented results show that coins and tokens have different values\nof approximated Zipf coefficient and centralization levels. This work is\nrelevant for DLTs as it might be useful in modeling and improving the committee\nselection process, especially in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)\nand delegated proof of stake (DPoS) blockchains.",

In this\npaper, we present a new scene text detection network (called FANet) with a Fast\nconvergence speed and Accurate text localization. The proposed FANet is an\nend-to-end text detector based on transformer feature learning and normalized\nFourier descriptor modeling, where the Fourier Descriptor Proposal Network and\nIterative Text Decoding Network are designed to efficiently and accurately\nidentify text proposals. Additionally, a Dense Matching Strategy and a\nwell-designed loss function are also proposed for optimizing the network\nperformance. Extensive experiments are carried out to demonstrate that the\nproposed FANet can achieve the SOTA performance with fewer training epochs and\nno pre-training. When we introduce additional data for pre-training, the\nproposed FANet can achieve SOTA performance on MSRATD500, CTW1500 and\nTotalText.

The most\nefficient use ballot-level comparison, comparing the voting system's\ninterpretation of individual ballot cards sampled at random (cast-vote records,\nCVRs) from a trustworthy paper trail to a human interpretation of the same\ncards. Such comparisons require the voting system to create and export CVRs in\na way that can be linked to the individual ballots the CVRs purport to\nrepresent. Such links can be created by keeping the ballots in the order in\nwhich they are scanned or by printing a unique serial number on each ballot.\nBut for precinct-count systems (PCOS), these strategies may compromise vote\nanonymity: the order in which ballots are cast may identify the voters who cast\nthem. Printing a unique pseudo-random number (\"cryptographic nonce\") on each\nballot card after the voter last touches it could reduce such privacy risks.\nBut what if the system does not in fact print a unique number on each ballot or\ndoes not accurately report the numbers it printed? This paper gives two ways to\nconduct an RLA so that even if the system does not print a genuine nonce on\neach ballot or misreports the nonces it used, the audit's risk limit is not\ncompromised (however, the anonymity of votes might be compromised). One method\nallows untrusted technology to be used to imprint and to retrieve ballot cards.\nThe method is adaptive: if the technology behaves properly, this protection\ndoes not increase the audit workload.

In this regard, we introduce Task Discrepancy Maximization (TDM),\na simple module for fine-grained few-shot classification. Our objective is to\nlocalize the class-wise discriminative regions by highlighting channels\nencoding distinct information of the class. Specifically, TDM learns\ntask-specific channel weights based on two novel components: Support Attention\nModule (SAM) and Query Attention Module (QAM). SAM produces a support weight to\nrepresent channel-wise discriminative power for each class. Still, since the\nSAM is basically only based on the labeled support sets, it can be vulnerable\nto bias toward such support set. Therefore, we propose QAM which complements\nSAM by yielding a query weight that grants more weight to object-relevant\nchannels for a given query image. By combining these two weights, a class-wise\ntask-specific channel weight is defined. The weights are then applied to\nproduce task-adaptive feature maps more focusing on the discriminative details.\nOur experiments validate the effectiveness of TDM and its complementary\nbenefits with prior methods in fine-grained few-shot classification.",

Pruning for SNNs is highly important as they become\ndeployed on a resource-constraint mobile/edge device. The previous SNN pruning\nworks focus on shallow SNNs (2~6 layers), however, deeper SNNs (>16 layers) are\nproposed by state-of-the-art SNN works, which is difficult to be compatible\nwith the current pruning work. To scale up a pruning technique toward deep\nSNNs, we investigate Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) which states that dense\nnetworks contain smaller subnetworks (i.e., winning tickets) that achieve\ncomparable performance to the dense networks. Our studies on LTH reveal that\nthe winning tickets consistently exist in deep SNNs across various datasets and\narchitectures, providing up to 97% sparsity without huge performance\ndegradation. However, the iterative searching process of LTH brings a huge\ntraining computational cost when combined with the multiple timesteps of SNNs.\nTo alleviate such heavy searching cost, we propose Early-Time (ET) ticket where\nwe find the important weight connectivity from a smaller number of timesteps.\nThe proposed ET ticket can be seamlessly combined with common pruning\ntechniques for finding winning tickets, such as Iterative Magnitude Pruning\n(IMP) and Early-Bird (EB) tickets.

Specifically, we build three\nitem-based CL tasks as a set of plug-and-play auxiliary objectives to capture\nitem correlations in feature, semantic and session levels.

However, to achieve this, the\nstate-of-the-art methods require either subsequently learning mapping functions\nto seek similar motions or training the model repetitively to enable control\nover the desired portion of body. In this paper, we propose a novel framework\nto learn disentangled representations for controllable human motion prediction.\nOur network involves a conditional variational auto-encoder (CVAE) architecture\nto model full-body human motion, and an extra CVAE path to learn only the\ncorresponding partial-body (e.g., lower-body) motion. Specifically, the\ninductive bias imposed by the extra CVAE path encourages two latent variables\nin two paths to respectively govern separate representations for each\npartial-body motion. With a single training, our model is able to provide two\ntypes of controls for the generated human motions: (i) strictly controlling one\nportion of human body and (ii) adaptively controlling the other portion, by\nsampling from a pair of latent spaces. Additionally, we extend and adapt a\nsampling strategy to our trained model to diversify the controllable\npredictions. Our framework also potentially allows new forms of control by\nflexibly customizing the input for the extra CVAE path. Extensive experimental\nresults and ablation studies demonstrate that our approach is capable of\npredicting state-of-the-art controllable human motions both qualitatively and\nquantitatively.",

Then, we quantize the weights based on their importance to\nminimize the loss of the information from the original weights/activations. We\nfurther perform progressive layer-wise quantization from the bottom layer to\nthe top, so that quantization at each layer reflects the quantized\ndistributions of weights and activations at previous layers. We validate the\neffectiveness of our method on various benchmark datasets against strong neural\nquantization baselines, demonstrating that it alleviates the performance\ndegeneration on ImageNet and successfully preserves the full-precision model\nperformance on CIFAR-100 with compact backbone networks.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown remarkable progress in GANs based on implicit\nneural representation (INR) - an MLP that produces an RGB value given its (x,\ny) coordinate. They represent an image as a continuous version of the\nunderlying 2D signal instead of a 2D array of pixels, which opens new horizons\nfor GAN applications (e.g., zero-shot super-resolution, image outpainting).\nHowever, training existing approaches require a heavy computational cost\nproportional to the image resolution, since they compute an MLP operation for\nevery (x, y) coordinate. To alleviate this issue, we propose a multi-stage\npatch-based training, a novel and scalable approach that can train INR-based\nGANs with a flexible computational cost regardless of the image resolution.\nSpecifically, our method allows to generate and discriminate by patch to learn\nthe local details of the image and learn global structural information by a\nnovel reconstruction loss to enable efficient GAN training. We conduct\nexperiments on several benchmark datasets to demonstrate that our approach\nenhances baseline models in GPU memory while maintaining FIDs at a reasonable\nlevel.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies show deep neural networks (DNNs) are extremely vulnerable to\nthe elaborately designed adversarial examples. Adversarial learning with those\nadversarial examples has been proved as one of the most effective methods to\ndefend against such an attack. At present, most existing adversarial examples\ngeneration methods are based on first-order gradients, which can hardly further\nimprove models' robustness, especially when facing second-order adversarial\nattacks. Compared with first-order gradients, second-order gradients provide a\nmore accurate approximation of the loss landscape with respect to natural\nexamples. Inspired by this, our work crafts second-order adversarial examples\nand uses them to train DNNs. Nevertheless, second-order optimization involves\ntime-consuming calculation for Hessian-inverse. We propose an approximation\nmethod through transforming the problem into an optimization in the Krylov\nsubspace, which remarkably reduce the computational complexity to speed up the\ntraining procedure. Extensive experiments conducted on the MINIST and CIFAR-10\ndatasets show that our adversarial learning with second-order adversarial\nexamples outperforms other fisrt-order methods, which can improve the model\nrobustness against a wide range of attacks.",

    "abstract": "We have seen a great progress in video action recognition in recent years.\nThere are several models based on convolutional neural network (CNN) with some\nrecent transformer based approaches which provide state-of-the-art performance\non existing benchmark datasets. However, large-scale robustness has not been\nstudied for these models which is a critical aspect for real-world\napplications. In this work we perform a large-scale robustness analysis of\nthese existing models for video action recognition. We mainly focus on\nrobustness against distribution shifts due to real-world perturbations instead\nof adversarial perturbations. We propose four different benchmark datasets,\nHMDB-51P, UCF-101P, Kinetics-400P, and SSv2P and study the robustness of six\ndifferent state-of-the-art action recognition models against 90 different\nperturbations. The study reveals some interesting findings, 1) transformer\nbased models are consistently more robust against most of the perturbations\nwhen compared with CNN based models, 2) Pretraining helps Transformer based\nmodels to be more robust to different perturbations than CNN based models, and\n3) All of the studied models are robust to temporal perturbation on the\nKinetics dataset, but not on SSv2; this suggests temporal information is much\nmore important for action label prediction on SSv2 datasets than on the\nKinetics dataset. We hope that this study will serve as a benchmark for future\nresearch in robust video action recognition. More details about the project are\navailable at https://rose-ar.github.io/.",

    "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on\nvarious computer vision applications. These models, however, have considerable\nstorage and computational overheads, making their deployment and efficient\ninference on edge devices challenging. Quantization is a promising approach to\nreducing model complexity; unfortunately, existing efforts to quantize ViTs are\nsimulated quantization (aka fake quantization), which remains floating-point\narithmetic during inference and thus contributes little to model acceleration.\nIn this paper, we propose I-ViT, an integer-only quantization scheme for ViTs,\nto enable ViTs to perform the entire computational graph of inference with\ninteger operations and bit-shifting and no floating-point operations. In I-ViT,\nlinear operations (e.g., MatMul and Dense) follow the integer-only pipeline\nwith dyadic arithmetic, and non-linear operations (e.g., Softmax, GELU, and\nLayerNorm) are approximated by the proposed light-weight integer-only\narithmetic methods. In particular, I-ViT applies the proposed Shiftmax and\nShiftGELU, which are designed to use integer bit-shifting to approximate the\ncorresponding floating-point operations. We evaluate I-ViT on various benchmark\nmodels and the results show that integer-only INT8 quantization achieves\ncomparable (or even higher) accuracy to the full-precision (FP) baseline.\nFurthermore, we utilize TVM for practical hardware deployment on the GPU's\ninteger arithmetic units, achieving 3.72~4.11$\\times$ inference speedup\ncompared to the FP model.",

The proposed navigation architecture\nis based on Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC), and utilizes an on-board\n2D LiDAR to detect obstacles and translate online the key geometric information\nof the environment into parametric constraints for the NMPC that constrain the\navailable position-space for the UAV. This article focuses also on the\nreal-world implementation and experimental validation of the proposed reactive\nnavigation scheme, and it is applied in multiple challenging laboratory\nexperiments, where we also conduct comparisons with relevant methods of\nreactive obstacle avoidance. The solver utilized in the proposed approach is\nthe Optimization Engine (OpEn) and the Proximal Averaged Newton for Optimal\nControl (PANOC) algorithm, where a penalty method is applied to properly\nconsider obstacles and input constraints during the navigation task. The\nproposed novel scheme allows for fast solutions, while using limited on-board\ncomputational power, that is a required feature for the overall closed loop\nperformance of an UAV and is applied in multiple real-time scenarios. The\ncombination of built-in obstacle avoidance and real-time applicability makes\nthe proposed reactive constrained navigation scheme an elegant framework for\nUAVs that is able to perform fast nonlinear control, local path-planning and\nobstacle avoidance, all embedded in the control layer.",

Meetings as a facilitator for\ncoordination and communication are an established medium for information\nexchange. Analyses of meetings in software projects have shown that certain\ninteractions in these meetings, such as proactive statements followed by\nsupportive ones, influence the mood and motivation of a team, which in turn\naffects its productivity. So far, however, research has focused only on certain\ninteractions at a detailed level, requiring a complex and fine-grained analysis\nof a meeting itself.\nAim: In this paper, we investigate meetings from a more abstract perspective,\nfocusing on the polarity of the statements, i.e., whether they appear to be\npositive, negative, or neutral.\nMethod: We analyze the relationship between the polarity of statements in\nmeetings and different social aspects, including conflicts as well as the mood\nbefore and after a meeting.\nResults: Our results emerge from 21 student software project meetings and\nshow some interesting insights: (1) Positive mood before a meeting is both\nrelated to the amount of positive statements in the beginning, as well as\nthroughout the whole meeting, (2) negative mood before the meeting only\ninfluences the amount of negative statements in the first quarter of the\nmeeting, but not the whole meeting, and (3) the amount of positive and negative\nstatements during the meeting has no influence on the mood afterwards.\nConclusions: We conclude that the behaviour in meetings might rather\ninfluence short-term emotional states (feelings) than long-term emotional\nstates (mood), which are more important for the project.",

However, playing a long\ntime-lapse sequence back as a video often results in distracting flicker due to\nrandom effects, such as weather, as well as cyclic effects, such as the\nday-night cycle. We introduce the problem of disentangling time-lapse sequences\nin a way that allows separate, after-the-fact control of overall trends, cyclic\neffects, and random effects in the images, and describe a technique based on\ndata-driven generative models that achieves this goal. This enables us to\n\"re-render\" the sequences in ways that would not be possible with the input\nimages alone. For example, we can stabilize a long sequence to focus on plant\ngrowth over many months, under selectable, consistent weather.\nOur approach is based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) that are\nconditioned with the time coordinate of the time-lapse sequence. Our\narchitecture and training procedure are designed so that the networks learn to\nmodel random variations, such as weather, using the GAN's latent space, and to\ndisentangle overall trends and cyclic variations by feeding the conditioning\ntime label to the model using Fourier features with specific frequencies.\nWe show that our models are robust to defects in the training data, enabling\nus to amend some of the practical difficulties in capturing long time-lapse\nsequences, such as temporary occlusions, uneven frame spacing, and missing\nframes.",

These methods utilize\nfine-label to optimize the model but ignore that fine-trained features are also\nprecious training resources, which can introduce preferable distribution to\nhard pixels (i.e., misclassified pixels). Inspired by contrastive learning in\nunsupervised paradigm, we apply the contrastive loss in a supervised manner and\nre-design the loss function to cast off the stereotype of unsupervised learning\n(e.g., imbalance of positives and negatives, confusion of anchors computing).\nTo this end, we propose Positive-Negative Equal contrastive loss (PNE loss),\nwhich increases the latent impact of positive embedding on the anchor and\ntreats the positive as well as negative sample pairs equally. The PNE loss can\nbe directly plugged right into existing semantic segmentation frameworks and\nleads to excellent performance with neglectable extra computational costs. We\nutilize a number of classic segmentation methods (e.g., DeepLabV3, OCRNet,\nUperNet) and backbone (e.g., ResNet, HRNet, Swin Transformer) to conduct\ncomprehensive experiments and achieve state-of-the-art performance on two\nbenchmark datasets (e.g., Cityscapes and COCO-Stuff).

We present an efficient motion planning framework for\nsimultaneously solving locomotion (e.g., centroidal dynamics), grasping (e.g.,\npatch contact), and contact (e.g., gait) problems.

The resulting frameworks use\nMixed-Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) to solve contact and NonLinear\nProgramming (NLP) to solve nonlinear dynamics, which are more computationally\ntractable and less sensitive to parameters. Also, we explicitly enforce patch\ncontact constraints from limit surfaces with micro-spine grippers.

    "abstract": "Although the vision-and-language pretraining (VLP) equipped cross-modal\nimage-text retrieval (ITR) has achieved remarkable progress in the past two\nyears, it suffers from a major drawback: the ever-increasing size of VLP models\nrestricts its deployment to real-world search scenarios (where the high latency\nis unacceptable). To alleviate this problem, we present a novel plug-in dynamic\ncontrastive distillation (DCD) framework to compress the large VLP models for\nthe ITR task. Technically, we face the following two challenges: 1) the typical\nuni-modal metric learning approach is difficult to directly apply to the\ncross-modal tasks, due to the limited GPU memory to optimize too many negative\nsamples during handling cross-modal fusion features. 2) it is inefficient to\nstatic optimize the student network from different hard samples, which have\ndifferent effects on distillation learning and student network optimization. We\ntry to overcome these challenges from two points. First, to achieve multi-modal\ncontrastive learning, and balance the training costs and effects, we propose to\nuse a teacher network to estimate the difficult samples for students, making\nthe students absorb the powerful knowledge from pre-trained teachers, and\nmaster the knowledge from hard samples. Second, to dynamic learn from hard\nsample pairs, we propose dynamic distillation to dynamically learn samples of\ndifferent difficulties, from the perspective of better balancing the difficulty\nof knowledge and students' self-learning ability. We successfully apply our\nproposed DCD strategy to two state-of-the-art vision-language pretrained\nmodels, i.e. ViLT and METER. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO and Flickr30K\nbenchmarks show the effectiveness and efficiency of our DCD framework.\nEncouragingly, we can speed up the inference at least 129$\\times$ compared to\nthe existing ITR models.",

In contrast, when just a portion (around half) of vehicles\nfollow these suggestions, and some degree of randomness is added to the\nremaining vehicles' paths, we observe a reduction in the overall CO2 emissions\nover the road network. Our work is a first step towards designing\nnext-generation routing principles that may increase urban well-being while\nsatisfying individual needs.",

    "title": "Generalisable Methods for Early Prediction in Interactive Simulations  for Education",
    "abstract": "Interactive simulations allow students to discover the underlying principles\nof a scientific phenomenon through their own exploration. Unfortunately,\nstudents often struggle to learn effectively in these environments. Classifying\nstudents' interaction data in the simulations based on their expected\nperformance has the potential to enable adaptive guidance and consequently\nimprove students' learning. Previous research in this field has mainly focused\non a-posteriori analyses or investigations limited to one specific predictive\nmodel and simulation. In this paper, we investigate the quality and\ngeneralisability of models for an early prediction of conceptual understanding\nbased on clickstream data of students across interactive simulations. We first\nmeasure the students' conceptual understanding through their in-task\nperformance. Then, we suggest a novel type of features that, starting from\nclickstream data, encodes both the state of the simulation and the action\nperformed by the student. We finally propose to feed these features into\nGRU-based models, with and without attention, for prediction. Experiments on\ntwo different simulations and with two different populations show that our\nproposed models outperform shallow learning baselines and better generalise to\ndifferent learning environments and populations. The inclusion of attention\ninto the model increases interpretability in terms of effective inquiry. The\nsource code is available on Github\n(https://github.com/epfl-ml4ed/beerslaw-lab.git).",

In fact, this bound naturally extends to all\ngraphs with a small separator into bounded-size sets. Finally, we prove\ninformation-theoretically a nearly-matching lower bound, i.e., that\n$\\tilde{\\Omega}(k^2)$ edges are required to sparsify quasi-bipartite undirected\ngraphs.",

    "abstract": "Most of anomaly detection algorithms are mainly focused on modeling the\ndistribution of normal samples and treating anomalies as outliers. However, the\ndiscriminative performance of the model may be insufficient due to the lack of\nknowledge about anomalies. Thus, anomalies should be exploited as possible.\nHowever, utilizing a few known anomalies during training may cause another\nissue that model may be biased by those known anomalies and fail to generalize\nto unseen anomalies. In this paper, we aim to exploit a few existing anomalies\nwith a carefully designed explicit boundary guided semi-push-pull learning\nstrategy, which can enhance discriminability while mitigating bias problem\ncaused by insufficient known anomalies. Our model is based on two core designs:\nFirst, finding one explicit separating boundary as the guidance for further\ncontrastive learning. Specifically, we employ normalizing flow to learn normal\nfeature distribution, then find an explicit separating boundary close to the\ndistribution edge. The obtained explicit and compact separating boundary only\nrelies on the normal feature distribution, thus the bias problem caused by a\nfew known anomalies can be mitigated. Second, learning more discriminative\nfeatures under the guidance of the explicit separating boundary. A boundary\nguided semi-push-pull loss is developed to only pull the normal features\ntogether while pushing the abnormal features apart from the separating boundary\nbeyond a certain margin region. In this way, our model can form a more explicit\nand discriminative decision boundary to achieve better results for known and\nalso unseen anomalies, while also maintaining high training efficiency.\nExtensive experiments on the widely-used MVTecAD benchmark show that the\nproposed method achieves new state-of-the-art results, with the performance of\n98.8% image-level AUROC and 99.4% pixel-level AUROC.",

The method solves an inverse Navier-Stokes boundary value\nproblem, which permits us to jointly reconstruct and segment the velocity\nfield, and at the same time infer hidden quantities such as the hydrodynamic\npressure and the wall shear stress. Using a Bayesian framework, we regularize\nthe problem by introducing a priori information about the unknown parameters in\nthe form of Gaussian random fields.

We\ncreate an algorithm that solves this reconstruction problem, and test it for\nnoisy and sparse $k$-space signals of the flow through a converging nozzle. We\nfind that the method is capable of reconstructing and segmenting the velocity\nfields from sparsely-sampled (15% $k$-space coverage), low ($\\sim$$10$)\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) signals, and that the reconstructed velocity field\ncompares well with that derived from fully-sampled (100% $k$-space coverage)\nhigh ($>40$) SNR signals of the same flow.",

    "abstract": "The implementation of registers from (potentially) weaker registers is a\nclassical problem in the theory of distributed computing. Since Lamport's\npioneering work, this problem has been extensively studied in the context of\nasynchronous processes with crash failures. In this paper, we investigate this\nproblem in the context of Byzantine process failures, with and without process\nsignatures. In particular, we first show a strong impossibility result, namely,\nthat there is no wait-free linearizable implementation of a 1-writer n-reader\nregister from atomic 1-writer (n-1)-reader registers. In fact, this\nimpossibility result holds even if all the processes except the writer are\ngiven atomic 1-writer n-reader registers, and even if we assume that the writer\ncan only crash and at most one reader is subject to Byzantine failures. In\nlight of this impossibility result, we give two register implementations. The\nfirst one implements a 1-writer n-reader register from atomic 1-writer 1-reader\nregisters. This implementation is linearizable (under any combination of\nByzantine process failures), but it is wait-free only under the assumption that\nthe writer is correct or no reader is Byzantine -- thus matching the\nimpossibility result. The second implementation assumes process signatures; it\nis wait-free and linearizable under any number and combination of Byzantine\nprocess failures.",

Among them, contrastive\nlearning methods adopted for AD always choose negative pairs that are both\nnormal to push away, which is objecting to AD tasks' purpose. Existing\nmulti-assumption-based methods are usually two-staged, firstly applying a\npre-training process whose target may differ from AD, so the performance is\nlimited by the pre-trained representations. This paper proposes a deep\nContrastive One-Class Anomaly detection method of time series (COCA), which\ncombines the normality assumptions of contrastive learning and one-class\nclassification. The key idea is to treat the representation and reconstructed\nrepresentation as the positive pair of negative-samples-free contrastive\nlearning, and we name it sequence contrast. Then we apply a contrastive\none-class loss function composed of invariance and variance terms, the former\noptimizing loss of the two assumptions simultaneously, and the latter\npreventing hypersphere collapse.

With sensors for detecting the closeness of\nobjects around you and prompting you to take a proper action or pull the mask\nautomatically. Along with the automated mask we will incorporate a temperature\nsensor to check vitals of an individual at all times and give an alert to the\npeers around him. This will ensure social distancing and help in avoiding\nspread of the virus.",

    "abstract": "Despite their commonly accepted usefulness, AI technologies are concerned\nwith ethical unreliability. Various guidelines, principles, and regulatory\nframeworks are designed to ensure that AI technologies bring ethical\nwell-being. However, the implications of AI ethics principles and guidelines\nare still being debated. To further explore the significance of AI ethics\nprinciples and relevant challenges, we conducted an empirical survey of 99 AI\npractitioners and lawmakers from twenty countries across five continents. Study\nfindings confirm that transparency, accountability, and privacy are the most\ncritical AI ethics principles. On the other hand, lack of ethical knowledge, no\nlegal frameworks, and lacking monitoring bodies are found the most common AI\nethics challenges. The impact analysis of the challenges across AI ethics\nprinciples reveals that conflict in practice is a highly severe challenge. Our\nfindings stimulate further research, epically empowering existing capability\nmaturity models to support the quality assessment of ethics-aware AI systems.",

    "title": "Auxiliary Task Guided Interactive Attention Model for Question  Difficulty Prediction",
    "abstract": "Online learning platforms conduct exams to evaluate the learners in a\nmonotonous way, where the questions in the database may be classified into\nBloom's Taxonomy as varying levels in complexity from basic knowledge to\nadvanced evaluation. The questions asked in these exams to all learners are\nvery much static. It becomes important to ask new questions with different\ndifficulty levels to each learner to provide a personalized learning\nexperience. In this paper, we propose a multi-task method with an interactive\nattention mechanism, Qdiff, for jointly predicting Bloom's Taxonomy and\ndifficulty levels of academic questions. We model the interaction between the\npredicted bloom taxonomy representations and the input representations using an\nattention mechanism to aid in difficulty prediction. The proposed learning\nmethod would help learn representations that capture the relationship between\nBloom's taxonomy and difficulty labels. The proposed multi-task method learns a\ngood input representation by leveraging the relationship between the related\ntasks and can be used in similar settings where the tasks are related. The\nresults demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than training only\non difficulty prediction. However, Bloom's labels may not always be given for\nsome datasets. Hence we soft label another dataset with a model fine-tuned to\npredict Bloom's labels to demonstrate the applicability of our method to\ndatasets with only difficulty labels.",

    "title": "Aligning Artificial Intelligence with Humans through Public Policy",
    "abstract": "Given that Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly permeates our lives, it\nis critical that we systematically align AI objectives with the goals and\nvalues of humans. The human-AI alignment problem stems from the impracticality\nof explicitly specifying the rewards that AI models should receive for all the\nactions they could take in all relevant states of the world. One possible\nsolution, then, is to leverage the capabilities of AI models to learn those\nrewards implicitly from a rich source of data describing human values in a wide\nrange of contexts. The democratic policy-making process produces just such data\nby developing specific rules, flexible standards, interpretable guidelines, and\ngeneralizable precedents that synthesize citizens' preferences over potential\nactions taken in many states of the world. Therefore, computationally encoding\npublic policies to make them legible to AI systems should be an important part\nof a socio-technical approach to the broader human-AI alignment puzzle. This\nEssay outlines research on AI that learn structures in policy data that can be\nleveraged for downstream tasks. As a demonstration of the ability of AI to\ncomprehend policy, we provide a case study of an AI system that predicts the\nrelevance of proposed legislation to any given publicly traded company and its\nlikely effect on that company. We believe this represents the \"comprehension\"\nphase of AI and policy, but leveraging policy as a key source of human values\nto align AI requires \"understanding\" policy. Solving the alignment problem is\ncrucial to ensuring that AI is beneficial both individually (to the person or\ngroup deploying the AI) and socially. As AI systems are given increasing\nresponsibility in high-stakes contexts, integrating democratically-determined\npolicy into those systems could align their behavior with human goals in a way\nthat is responsive to a constantly evolving society.",

    "abstract": "Workplaces of the future require advanced competence profiles from employees,\nnot least due to new options for teleworking and new complex digital tools. The\nacquisition of advanced competence profiles is to be addressed by formal\neducation. For example, the method of Building Information Modeling (BIM) aims\nat digitizing the design, construction, and operation of structures and as such\nrequires advanced competence profiles. In this study, two educational scenarios\nbased on teleworking and complex digital tools are compared, each with one\ncohort and consisting of two learning activities. The first cohort initially\ncompletes as first learning activity a semester-long course that aims at BIM\ndomain competences. The semester-long course of the second cohort fosters meta\ncompetences, such as communication, collaboration, and digital literacy. At the\nend of the semester, both cohorts solve in a second learning activity a BIM\npractice task. Research questions are: (1) Do the two educational scenarios\npromote the competences to be addressed? And related: (2) What is the impact of\nthe initial course that fosters domain competences or meta competences?\nMethodologically, the learning outcomes are assessed by measuring the domain\ncompetences three times during the educational scenario using online tests in\nthe two cohorts (N=11). Further, students' perceptions are surveyed in parallel\nusing online questionnaires. In addition, semi-structured interviews are\nconducted at the end of the educational scenarios. The quantitative and\nqualitative results of the study designating the training of meta competencies\npartly as a substitute for imparting domain competences are presented. Further,\nthe influence of both educational scenarios on competence development for the\nworkplace of the future characterized by telework and digital tools is\ndiscussed.",

The medical\ntreatment care options offered by the medical system make it sophisticated.\nHowever, many American patients are not receiving health care on a regular\nbasis, and at the same time, they cannot afford it. Also, the current medical\nsystem has many flaws such as high medical treatment costs and lack of doctors\nto accommodate many patients. This paper presents the principles of medical\nartificial intelligence called the knowledge based system. Doctors can remotely\ncheck and monitor their patients health data, medical history, how and what\nmedical tests were done, and the lab results. The patients have access to\ndetailed health information online and do not need to make an appointment with\ndoctors to check their health on a daily basis. One doctor can check many\npatients simultaneously online (when medical centers are understaffed) and do\nnot need to spend a lot of time with patients. Thus, doctors save more money\nfor patients, because patients will no longer be transporting to medical\ncenters to receive routine health check-ups. Patients do not need to overpay\nfor their insurance because they will have access to the knowledge-based\nsystem, and the system will save the patients money to have their health\nchecked and reduce the number of unnecessary medical exams.

    "title": "Gender inequality and self-publication patterns among scientific editors",
    "abstract": "Academic publishing is the principal medium of documenting and disseminating\nscientific discoveries. At the heart of its daily operations are the editorial\nboards. Despite their activities and recruitment often being opaque to outside\nobservers, they play a crucial role in promoting fair evaluations and gender\nparity. Literature on gender inequality lacks the connection between women as\neditors and as research-active scientists, thereby missing the comparison\nbetween the gender balances in these two academic roles. Literature on\neditorial fairness similarly lacks longitudinal studies on the conflicts of\ninterest arising from editors being research active, which motivates them to\nexpedite the publication of their papers. We fill these gaps using a dataset of\n103,000 editors, 240 million authors, and 220 million publications spanning\nfive decades and 15 disciplines. This unique dataset allows us to compare the\nproportion of female editors to that of female scientists in any given year or\ndiscipline. Although women are already underrepresented in science (26%), they\nare even more so among editors (14%) and editors-in-chief (8%); the lack of\nwomen with long-enough publishing careers explains the gender gap among\neditors, but not editors-in-chief, suggesting that other factors may be at\nplay. Our dataset also allows us to study the self-publication patterns of\neditors, revealing that 8% of them double the rate at which they publish in\ntheir own journal soon after the editorship starts, and this behavior is\naccentuated in journals where the editors-in-chief self-publish excessively.\nFinally, men are more likely to engage in this behaviour than women.",

The transformer model has been applied to the field of\ncomputer vision (CV) after its success in natural language processing (NLP).\nRadiologists continue to face multiple challenges in today's rapidly evolving\nmedical field, such as increased workload and increased diagnostic demands.\nAlthough there are some conventional methods for lung cancer detection before,\ntheir accuracy still needs to be improved, especially in realistic diagnostic\nscenarios. This paper creatively proposes a segmentation method based on\nefficient transformer and applies it to medical image analysis. The algorithm\ncompletes the task of lung cancer classification and segmentation by analyzing\nlung cancer data, and aims to provide efficient technical support for medical\nstaff. In addition, we evaluated and compared the results in various aspects.\nFor the classification mission, the max accuracy of Swin-T by regular training\nand Swin-B in two resolutions by pre-training can be up to 82.3%. For the\nsegmentation mission, we use pre-training to help the model improve the\naccuracy of our experiments.

    "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Completion has been widely studied recently to complete\nmissing elements within triples via mainly modeling graph structural features,\nbut performs sensitive to the sparsity of graph structure. Relevant texts like\nentity names and descriptions, acting as another expression form for Knowledge\nGraphs (KGs), are expected to solve this challenge. Several methods have been\nproposed to utilize both structure and text messages with two encoders, but\nonly achieved limited improvements due to the failure to balance weights\nbetween them. And reserving both structural and textual encoders during\ninference also suffers from heavily overwhelmed parameters. Motivated by\nKnowledge Distillation, we view knowledge as mappings from input to output\nprobabilities and propose a plug-and-play framework VEM2L over sparse KGs to\nfuse knowledge extracted from text and structure messages into a unity.\nSpecifically, we partition knowledge acquired by models into two nonoverlapping\nparts: one part is relevant to the fitting capacity upon training triples,\nwhich could be fused by motivating two encoders to learn from each other on\ntraining sets; the other reflects the generalization ability upon unobserved\nqueries. And correspondingly, we propose a new fusion strategy proved by\nVariational EM algorithm to fuse the generalization ability of models, during\nwhich we also apply graph densification operations to further alleviate the\nsparse graph problem. By combining these two fusion methods, we propose VEM2L\nframework finally.

    "abstract": "Stack Overflow (SO) is a popular platform among developers seeking advice on\nvarious software-related topics, including privacy and security. As for many\nknowledge-sharing websites, the value of SO depends largely on users'\nengagement, namely their willingness to answer, comment or post technical\nquestions. Still, many of these questions (including cybersecurity-related\nones) remain unanswered, putting the site's relevance and reputation into\nquestion. Hence, it is important to understand users' participation in privacy\nand security discussions to promote engagement and foster the exchange of such\nexpertise. Objective: Based on prior findings on online social networks, this\nwork elaborates on the interplay between users' engagement and their privacy\npractices in SO. Particularly, it analyses developers' self-disclosure\nbehaviour regarding profile visibility and their involvement in discussions\nrelated to privacy and security. Method: We followed a mixed-methods approach\nby (i) analysing SO data from 1239 cybersecurity-tagged questions along with\n7048 user profiles, and (ii) conducting an anonymous online survey (N=64).\nResults: About 33% of the questions we retrieved had no answer, whereas more\nthan 50% had no accepted answer. We observed that \"proactive\" users tend to\ndisclose significantly less information in their profiles than \"reactive\" and\n\"unengaged\" ones. However, no correlations were found between these engagement\ncategories and privacy-related constructs such as Perceived Control or General\nPrivacy Concerns. Implications: These findings contribute to (i) a better\nunderstanding of developers' engagement towards privacy and security topics,\nand (ii) to shape strategies promoting the exchange of cybersecurity expertise\nin SO.",

Proactive assessment of such risks is\nalso challenging due to the lack of ML-powered 5G equipment available for\nadversarial ML research.\nTo tackle these problems, we propose a novel adversarial ML threat model that\nis particularly suited to 5G scenarios, and is agnostic to the precise function\nsolved by ML. In contrast to existing ML threat models, our attacks do not\nrequire any compromise of the target 5G system while still being viable due to\nthe QoS guarantees and the open nature of 5G networks. Furthermore, we propose\nan original framework for realistic ML security assessments based on public\ndata. We proactively evaluate our threat model on 6 applications of ML\nenvisioned in 5G.

Recently, self-supervised\nlearning based upon masking local surface patches for 3D point cloud data has\nbeen under-explored. In this paper, we propose masked Autoencoders in 3D point\ncloud representation learning (abbreviated as MAE3D), a novel autoencoding\nparadigm for self-supervised learning. We first split the input point cloud\ninto patches and mask a portion of them, then use our Patch Embedding Module to\nextract the features of unmasked patches. Secondly, we employ patch-wise MAE3D\nTransformers to learn both local features of point cloud patches and high-level\ncontextual relationships between patches and complete the latent\nrepresentations of masked patches. We use our Point Cloud Reconstruction Module\nwith multi-task loss to complete the incomplete point cloud as a result.

However,\nwe demonstrate that BN comes with a fundamental drawback: it incentivizes the\nmodel to rely on low-variance features that are highly specific to the training\n(in-domain) data, hurting generalization performance on out-of-domain examples.\nIn this work, we investigate this phenomenon by first showing that removing BN\nlayers across a wide range of architectures leads to lower out-of-domain and\ncorruption errors at the cost of higher in-domain errors. We then propose\nCounterbalancing Teacher (CT), a method which leverages a frozen copy of the\nsame model without BN as a teacher to enforce the student network's learning of\nrobust representations by substantially adapting its weights through a\nconsistency loss function. This regularization signal helps CT perform well in\nunforeseen data shifts, even without information from the target domain as in\nprior works.

    "abstract": "We propose a decomposition of constitutive relations into crack-driving and\npersistent portions, specifically designed for materials with\nanisotropic/orthotropic behavior in the phase field approach to fracture to\naccount for the tension-compression asymmetry. This decomposition follows a\nvariational framework, satisfying the orthogonality condition for anisotropic\nmaterials. This implies that the present model can be applied to arbitrary\nanisotropic elastic behavior in a three-dimensional setting. On this basis, we\ngeneralize two existing models for tension-compression asymmetry in isotropic\nmaterials, namely the volumetric-deviatoric model and the no-tension model,\ntowards materials with anisotropic nature. Two benchmark problems, single\nnotched tensile shear tests, are used to study the performance of the present\nmodel. The results can retain the anisotropic constitutive behavior and the\ntension-compression asymmetry in the crack response, and are qualitatively in\naccordance with the expected behavior for orthotropic materials. Furthermore,\nto study the direction of maximum energy dissipation, we modify the surface\nintegral based energy release computation, $G_\\theta$, to account only for the\ncrack-driving energy.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study differentially private empirical risk minimization\n(DP-ERM). It has been shown that the (worst-case) utility of DP-ERM reduces as\nthe dimension increases. This is a major obstacle to privately learning large\nmachine learning models. In high dimension, it is common for some model's\nparameters to carry more information than others. To exploit this, we propose a\ndifferentially private greedy coordinate descent (DP-GCD) algorithm. At each\niteration, DP-GCD privately performs a coordinate-wise gradient step along the\ngradients' (approximately) greatest entry. We show theoretically that DP-GCD\ncan improve utility by exploiting structural properties of the problem's\nsolution (such as sparsity or quasi-sparsity), with very fast progress in early\niterations. We then illustrate this numerically, both on synthetic and real\ndatasets. Finally, we describe promising directions for future work.",

Recent methods proposed to mitigate this limitation\nincrease the diversity of generated samples, yet they reduce the performance of\nthe models when similarity of samples is required. To address this shortcoming,\nwe propose a novel method to selectively increase the diversity of\nGAN-generated samples. By adding a simple, yet effective regularization to the\ntraining loss function we encourage the generator to discover new data modes\nfor inputs related to diverse outputs while generating consistent samples for\nthe remaining ones.

    "abstract": "Using search engines for web image retrieval is a tempting alternative to\nmanual curation when creating an image dataset, but their main drawback remains\nthe proportion of incorrect (noisy) samples retrieved. These noisy samples have\nbeen evidenced by previous works to be a mixture of in-distribution (ID)\nsamples, assigned to the incorrect category but presenting similar visual\nsemantics to other classes in the dataset, and out-of-distribution (OOD)\nimages, which share no semantic correlation with any category from the dataset.\nThe latter are, in practice, the dominant type of noisy images retrieved. To\ntackle this noise duality, we propose a two stage algorithm starting with a\ndetection step where we use unsupervised contrastive feature learning to\nrepresent images in a feature space. We find that the alignment and uniformity\nprinciples of contrastive learning allow OOD samples to be linearly separated\nfrom ID samples on the unit hypersphere. We then spectrally embed the\nunsupervised representations using a fixed neighborhood size and apply an\noutlier sensitive clustering at the class level to detect the clean and OOD\nclusters as well as ID noisy outliers.

However, few\nexisting generative models take causality into account. We propose a new\ndecoder based framework named the Causal Counterfactual Generative Model\n(CCGM), which includes a partially trainable causal layer in which a part of a\ncausal model can be learned without significantly impacting reconstruction\nfidelity. By learning the causal relationships between image semantic labels or\ntabular variables, we can analyze biases, intervene on the generative model,\nand simulate new scenarios. Furthermore, by modifying the causal structure, we\ncan generate samples outside the domain of the original training data and use\nsuch counterfactual models to de-bias datasets. Thus, datasets with known\nbiases can still be used to train the causal generative model and learn the\ncausal relationships, but we can produce de-biased datasets on the generative\nside. Our proposed method combines a causal latent space VAE model with\nspecific modification to emphasize causal fidelity, enabling finer control over\nthe causal layer and the ability to learn a robust intervention framework. We\nexplore how better disentanglement of causal learning and encoding/decoding\ngenerates higher causal intervention quality.

We observe that the final prediction in vision\nTransformers is only based on a subset of the most informative tokens, which is\nsufficient for accurate image recognition. Based on this observation, we\npropose a dynamic token sparsification framework to prune redundant tokens\nprogressively and dynamically based on the input to accelerate vision\nTransformers. Specifically, we devise a lightweight prediction module to\nestimate the importance score of each token given the current features. The\nmodule is added to different layers to prune redundant tokens hierarchically.\nWhile the framework is inspired by our observation of the sparse attention in\nvision Transformers, we find the idea of adaptive and asymmetric computation\ncan be a general solution for accelerating various architectures. We extend our\nmethod to hierarchical models including CNNs and hierarchical vision\nTransformers as well as more complex dense prediction tasks that require\nstructured feature maps by formulating a more generic dynamic spatial\nsparsification framework with progressive sparsification and asymmetric\ncomputation for different spatial locations. By applying lightweight fast paths\nto less informative features and using more expressive slow paths to more\nimportant locations, we can maintain the structure of feature maps while\nsignificantly reducing the overall computations. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on various modern architectures\nand different visual recognition tasks.

Recently, transformers have shown their strong\ncapability in various applications by capturing global pixel interactions and\nthis capability is highly desirable in shadow removal. However, applying\ntransformers to promote shadow removal is non-trivial for the following two\nreasons: 1) The patchify operation is not suitable for shadow removal due to\nirregular shadow shapes; 2) shadow removal only needs one-way interaction from\nthe non-shadow region to the shadow region instead of the common two-way\ninteractions among all pixels in the image. In this paper, we propose a novel\ncross-region transformer, namely CRFormer, for shadow removal which differs\nfrom existing transformers by only considering the pixel interactions from the\nnon-shadow region to the shadow region without splitting images into patches.\nThis is achieved by a carefully designed region-aware cross-attention operation\nthat can aggregate the recovered shadow region features conditioned on the\nnon-shadow region features. Extensive experiments on ISTD, AISTD, SRD, and\nVideo Shadow Removal datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method\ncompared to other state-of-the-art methods.",

Methods to handle such problems\nmust specify what structure is common between the domains and what varies. A\nnatural assumption is that causal (structural) relationships are invariant in\nall domains. Then, it is tempting to learn a predictor for label $Y$ that\ndepends only on its causal parents. However, many real-world problems are\n\"anti-causal\" in the sense that $Y$ is a cause of the covariates $X$ -- in this\ncase, $Y$ has no causal parents and the naive causal invariance is useless. In\nthis paper, we study representation learning under a particular notion of\ndomain shift that both respects causal invariance and that naturally handles\nthe \"anti-causal\" structure. We show how to leverage the shared causal\nstructure of the domains to learn a representation that both admits an\ninvariant predictor and that also allows fast adaptation in new domains. The\nkey is to translate causal assumptions into learning principles that\ndisentangle \"invariant\" and \"non-stable\" features.

    "abstract": "Applications of multilevel models usually result in binary classification\nwithin groups or hierarchies based on a set of input features. For transparent\nand ethical applications of such models, sound audit frameworks need to be\ndeveloped. In this paper, an audit framework for technical assessment of\nregression MLMs is proposed. The focus is on three aspects, model,\ndiscrimination, and transparency and explainability. These aspects are\nsubsequently divided into sub aspects. Contributors, such as inter MLM group\nfairness, feature contribution order, and aggregated feature contribution, are\nidentified for each of these sub aspects. To measure the performance of the\ncontributors, the framework proposes a shortlist of KPIs. A traffic light risk\nassessment method is furthermore coupled to these KPIs. For assessing\ntransparency and explainability, different explainability methods (SHAP and\nLIME) are used, which are compared with a model intrinsic method using\nquantitative methods and machine learning modelling. Using an open source\ndataset, a model is trained and tested and the KPIs are computed. It is\ndemonstrated that popular explainability methods, such as SHAP and LIME,\nunderperform in accuracy when interpreting these models. They fail to predict\nthe order of feature importance, the magnitudes, and occasionally even the\nnature of the feature contribution. For other contributors, such as group\nfairness and their associated KPIs, similar analysis and calculations have been\nperformed with the aim of adding profundity to the proposed audit framework.\nThe framework is expected to assist regulatory bodies in performing conformity\nassessments of AI systems using multilevel binomial classification models at\nbusinesses.

VI\nproceeds in batches, where the update to the value of each state must be\ncompleted before the next batch of updates can begin. Completing a single batch\nis prohibitively expensive if the state space is large, rendering VI\nimpractical for many applications. Asynchronous VI helps to address the large\nstate space problem by updating one state at a time, in-place and in an\narbitrary order. However, Asynchronous VI still requires a maximization over\nthe entire action space, making it impractical for domains with large action\nspace. To address this issue, we propose doubly-asynchronous value iteration\n(DAVI), a new algorithm that generalizes the idea of asynchrony from states to\nstates and actions. More concretely, DAVI maximizes over a sampled subset of\nactions that can be of any user-defined size. This simple approach of using\nsampling to reduce computation maintains similarly appealing theoretical\nproperties to VI without the need to wait for a full sweep through the entire\naction space in each update. In this paper, we show DAVI converges to the\noptimal value function with probability one, converges at a near-geometric rate\nwith probability 1-delta, and returns a near-optimal policy in computation time\nthat nearly matches a previously established bound for VI. We also empirically\ndemonstrate DAVI's effectiveness in several experiments.",

During this process the recommender system\ninfluences the user behavioral data that is subsequently used to update it,\nthus creating a feedback loop. Recent work has shown that feedback loops may\ncompromise recommendation quality and homogenize user behavior, raising ethical\nand performance concerns when deploying recommender systems. To address these\nissues, we propose the Causal Adjustment for Feedback Loops (CAFL), an\nalgorithm that provably breaks feedback loops using causal inference and can be\napplied to any recommendation algorithm that optimizes a training loss. Our\nmain observation is that a recommender system does not suffer from feedback\nloops if it reasons about causal quantities, namely the intervention\ndistributions of recommendations on user ratings. Moreover, we can calculate\nthis intervention distribution from observational data by adjusting for the\nrecommender system's predictions of user preferences.

    "abstract": "Animal behavior is driven by multiple brain regions working in parallel with\ndistinct control policies. We present a biologically plausible model of\noff-policy reinforcement learning in the basal ganglia, which enables learning\nin such an architecture. The model accounts for action-related modulation of\ndopamine activity that is not captured by previous models that implement\non-policy algorithms. In particular, the model predicts that dopamine activity\nsignals a combination of reward prediction error (as in classic models) and\n\"action surprise,\" a measure of how unexpected an action is relative to the\nbasal ganglia's current policy. In the presence of the action surprise term,\nthe model implements an approximate form of Q-learning. On benchmark navigation\nand reaching tasks, we show empirically that this model is capable of learning\nfrom data driven completely or in part by other policies (e.g. from other brain\nregions). By contrast, models without the action surprise term suffer in the\npresence of additional policies, and are incapable of learning at all from\nbehavior that is completely externally driven. The model provides a\ncomputational account for numerous experimental findings about dopamine\nactivity that cannot be explained by classic models of reinforcement learning\nin the basal ganglia. These include differing levels of action surprise signals\nin dorsal and ventral striatum, decreasing amounts movement-modulated dopamine\nactivity with practice, and representations of action initiation and kinematics\nin dopamine activity. It also provides further predictions that can be tested\nwith recordings of striatal dopamine activity.",

There is a\nneed to identify individual students talking in small groups from other\nstudents talking at the same time. To solve the problem, we assume the use of a\nsingle microphone per student group without any access to previous large\ndatasets for training.\nThis dissertation proposes a method of speaker identification using\ncross-correlation patterns associated to an array of virtual microphones,\ncentered around the physical microphone. The virtual microphones are simulated\nby using approximate speaker geometry observed from a video recording. The\npatterns are constructed based on estimates of the room impulse responses for\neach virtual microphone. The correlation patterns are then used to identify the\nspeakers.

Smooth pycnophylactic\ninterpolation aims to find a smooth, nonnegative function such that the area\nintegral over each enumeration unit is equal to the aggregated data.\nConventionally, smooth pycnophylactic interpolation is achieved by a cellular\nautomaton algorithm that converts a piecewise constant function into an\napproximately smooth function defined on a grid of coordinates on an equal-area\nmap. An alternative approach, proposed by Tobler in 1976, is to construct a\ndensity-equalising map projection in which areas of enumeration units are\nproportional to the aggregated data. A pycnophylactic interpolation can be\nobtained from the Jacobian of this projection. Here, we describe a software\nimplementation of this method.

Under this new framework, systemic risk\nmeasures can be interpreted as the minimal amount of cash that secures the\naggregated system by allocating capital to the single institutions before\naggregating the individual risks. This problem has no explicit solution except\nin very limited situations. Deep learning is increasingly receiving attention\nin financial modelings and risk management and we propose our deep learning\nbased algorithms to solve both the primal and dual problems of the risk\nmeasures, and thus to learn the fair risk allocations.

We close the paper with\nsubstantial numerical studies of the subject and provide interpretations of the\nrisk allocations associated to the systemic risk measures.

When\nthe proportion of each class in the test set differs from the training set, the\nperformance of classification nets usually degrades.

In this paper, we propose the first method to\ntackle label shift for medical image classification, which effectively adapt\nthe model learned from a single training label distribution to arbitrary\nunknown test label distribution. Our approach innovates distribution\ncalibration to learn multiple representative classifiers, which are capable of\nhandling different one-dominating-class distributions. When given a test image,\nthe diverse classifiers are dynamically aggregated via the consistency-driven\ntest-time adaptation, to deal with the unknown test label distribution. We\nvalidate our method on two important medical image classification tasks\nincluding liver fibrosis staging and COVID-19 severity prediction.

Researchers focused on studying\nvarious model architectures, such as Bayesian networks and deep learning\nmethods, as well as on the analysis of different representations of the speech\nsignal. Despite significant progress in recent years, existing CAPT methods are\nnot able to detect pronunciation errors with high accuracy (only 60\\% precision\nat 40\\%-80\\% recall). One of the key problems is the low availability of\nmispronounced speech that is needed for the reliable training of pronunciation\nerror detection models. If we had a generative model that could mimic\nnon-native speech and produce any amount of training data, then the task of\ndetecting pronunciation errors would be much easier. We present three\ninnovative techniques based on phoneme-to-phoneme (P2P), text-to-speech (T2S),\nand speech-to-speech (S2S) conversion to generate correctly pronounced and\nmispronounced synthetic speech. We show that these techniques not only improve\nthe accuracy of three machine learning models for detecting pronunciation\nerrors but also help establish a new state-of-the-art in the field. Earlier\nstudies have used simple speech generation techniques such as P2P conversion,\nbut only as an additional mechanism to improve the accuracy of pronunciation\nerror detection. We, on the other hand, consider speech generation to be the\nfirst-class method of detecting pronunciation errors. The effectiveness of\nthese techniques is assessed in the tasks of detecting pronunciation and\nlexical stress errors. Non-native English speech corpora of German, Italian,\nand Polish speakers are used in the evaluations. The best proposed S2S\ntechnique improves the accuracy of detecting pronunciation errors in AUC metric\nby 41\\% from 0.528 to 0.749 compared to the state-of-the-art approach.",

In this paper,\na generic near-field positioning model with different observation capabilities\nfor three electric fields (vector, scalar and overall scalar electric field) is\nproposed. For these three electric field types, the Cram\\'er-Rao bound (CRB) is\nadopted to evaluate the achievable estimation accuracy. The expressions of the\nCRBs using different electric field observations are derived by combining\nelectromagnetic theory with estimation theory. Closed-form expressions can be\nfurther obtained if the terminal is located on the central perpendicular line\n(CPL) of the receiving antenna surface. In addition, the above discussions are\nextended to the system with multiple distributed receiving antennas under the\nCPL assumption. The CRBs using various electric fields in this case are derived\nand the effect of different numbers of receiving antennas on estimation\naccuracy is investigated. Numerical results are provided to quantify the CRBs\nand validate the analytical results.

Increasingly, different DL approaches are being adopted to\ndownscale coarser precipitation data and generate more accurate and reliable\nestimates at local (~few km or even smaller) scales. Despite several studies\nadopting dynamical or statistical downscaling of precipitation, the accuracy is\nlimited by the availability of ground truth. A key challenge to gauge the\naccuracy of such methods is to compare the downscaled data to point-scale\nobservations which are often unavailable at such small scales. In this work, we\ncarry out the DL-based downscaling to estimate the local precipitation data\nfrom the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which was created by\napproximating the value from station location to a grid point. To test the\nefficacy of different DL approaches, we apply four different methods of\ndownscaling and evaluate their performance. The considered approaches are (i)\nDeep Statistical Downscaling (DeepSD), augmented Convolutional Long Short Term\nMemory (ConvLSTM), fully convolutional network (U-NET), and Super-Resolution\nGenerative Adversarial Network (SR-GAN). A custom VGG network, used in the\nSR-GAN, is developed in this work using precipitation data. The results\nindicate that SR-GAN is the best method for precipitation data downscaling.

    "abstract": "Medical image synthesis has attracted increasing attention because it could\ngenerate missing image data, improving diagnosis and benefits many downstream\ntasks. However, so far the developed synthesis model is not adaptive to unseen\ndata distribution that presents domain shift, limiting its applicability in\nclinical routine. This work focuses on exploring domain adaptation (DA) of 3D\nimage-to-image synthesis models. First, we highlight the technical difference\nin DA between classification, segmentation and synthesis models. Second, we\npresent a novel efficient adaptation approach based on 2D variational\nautoencoder which approximates 3D distributions. Third, we present empirical\nstudies on the effect of the amount of adaptation data and the key\nhyper-parameters. Our results show that the proposed approach can significantly\nimprove the synthesis accuracy on unseen domains in a 3D setting.

    "abstract": "Tree ensembles can be well-suited for black-box optimization tasks such as\nalgorithm tuning and neural architecture search, as they achieve good\npredictive performance with little to no manual tuning, naturally handle\ndiscrete feature spaces, and are relatively insensitive to outliers in the\ntraining data. Two well-known challenges in using tree ensembles for black-box\noptimization are (i) effectively quantifying model uncertainty for exploration\nand (ii) optimizing over the piece-wise constant acquisition function. To\naddress both points simultaneously, we propose using the kernel interpretation\nof tree ensembles as a Gaussian Process prior to obtain model variance\nestimates, and we develop a compatible optimization formulation for the\nacquisition function. The latter further allows us to seamlessly integrate\nknown constraints to improve sampling efficiency by considering\ndomain-knowledge in engineering settings and modeling search space symmetries,\ne.g., hierarchical relationships in neural architecture search. Our framework\nperforms as well as state-of-the-art methods for unconstrained black-box\noptimization over continuous/discrete features and outperforms competing\nmethods for problems combining mixed-variable feature spaces and known input\nconstraints.",

The presented technique operates by sampling the incoming signal as an\ninput, and produces the frequency and the power readings of the detected\ninterferer. The detection method relies on driving an open circuit stub, where\nthe voltage is proportional to the power of the interferer, and the standing\nwave pattern is an indicator of its frequency. This approach is feasible over\nmulti-octave bandwidth with a wide power dynamic range. The concept is analyzed\nfor design and optimization, and a prototype is built for a proof-of-concept.\nThe measured results demonstrate the ability to detect an interferer within the\n1--16 GHz frequency range, with a power dynamic range between -20 to 20 dBm.\nThe detection concept is also fitted with different types of tunable bandstop\nfilters (BSFs) for automatic detection and suppression of the interferer if its\npower exceeds a programmable threshold. With a measured response time of 500\nns, the presented method is a technology enabler for wideband receivers.",

Traditional approaches\nused in microscopic super-resolution imaging, such as the Double-Helix PSF\n(DHPSF), are ill-suited for scenes that are more complex than a sparse set of\npoint light sources. We show, using the Cram\\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB), that\nseparating the two lobes of the DHPSF and thereby capturing two separate images\nleads to a dramatic increase in depth accuracy. A unique property of the phase\nmask used for generating the DHPSF is that a separation of the phase mask into\ntwo halves leads to a spatial separation of the two lobes. We leverage this\nproperty to build a compact polarization-based optical setup, where we place\ntwo orthogonal linear polarizers on each half of the DHPSF phase mask and then\ncapture the resulting image with a polarization sensitive camera. Results from\nsimulations and a lab prototype demonstrate that our technique achieves up to\n$50\\%$ lower depth error compared to state-of-the-art designs including the\nDHPSF, and the Tetrapod PSF, with little to no loss in spatial resolution.",

Following the attributes identified from fMRI data using\nan attribute classifier, the direction in which to manipulate attributes is\ndecided and the attribute manipulator adjusts the latent code to improve the\nconsistency between the seen image and the reconstructed image.

Previous works usually adopt\nrecognized hypotheses of historical utterances as preceding context, which may\nbias the current recognized hypothesis due to the inevitable\nhistoricalrecognition errors. To avoid this problem, we propose an\naudio-textual cross-modal representation extractor to learn contextual\nrepresentations directly from preceding speech. Specifically, it consists of\ntwo modal-related encoders, extracting high-level latent features from speech\nand the corresponding text, and a cross-modal encoder, which aims to learn the\ncorrelation between speech and text. We randomly mask some input tokens and\ninput sequences of each modality. Then a token-missing or modal-missing\nprediction with a modal-level CTC loss on the cross-modal encoder is performed.\nThus, the model captures not only the bi-directional context dependencies in a\nspecific modality but also relationships between different modalities. Then,\nduring the training of the conversational ASR system, the extractor will be\nfrozen to extract the textual representation of preceding speech, while such\nrepresentation is used as context fed to the ASR decoder through attention\nmechanism. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated on several\nMandarin conversation corpora and the highest character error rate (CER)\nreduction up to 16% is achieved on the MagicData dataset.",

Many of the tools used for conflict-free colouring of geometric\nhypergraphs rely on hereditary properties of the underlying hypergraphs.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a new variational inference framework for image\nrestoration and a convolutional neural network (CNN) structure that can solve\nthe restoration problems described by the proposed framework. Earlier CNN-based\nimage restoration methods primarily focused on network architecture design or\ntraining strategy with non-blind scenarios where the degradation models are\nknown or assumed. For a step closer to real-world applications, CNNs are also\nblindly trained with the whole dataset, including diverse degradations.\nHowever, the conditional distribution of a high-quality image given a diversely\ndegraded one is too complicated to be learned by a single CNN. Therefore, there\nhave also been some methods that provide additional prior information to train\na CNN. Unlike previous approaches, we focus more on the objective of\nrestoration based on the Bayesian perspective and how to reformulate the\nobjective. Specifically, our method relaxes the original posterior inference\nproblem to better manageable sub-problems and thus behaves like a\ndivide-and-conquer scheme. As a result, the proposed framework boosts the\nperformance of several restoration problems compared to the previous ones.\nSpecifically, our method delivers state-of-the-art performance on Gaussian\ndenoising, real-world noise reduction, blind image super-resolution, and JPEG\ncompression artifacts reduction.",

In this paper, we present an\nempirical investigation that aims to shed light on this issue for time series.\nNamely, we examine the ability of two general-purpose time-series GANs, a\ndirect time-series model and an image-based model using a short-time Fourier\ntransform (STFT) representation, to learn a broad range of noise types commonly\nencountered in electronics and communication systems: band-limited thermal\nnoise, power law noise, shot noise, and impulsive noise.

And,\nits convergence process is deterministic.\nWe tested the model, named Gam-Chain, using recent Crypto, Nasdaq, and Forex\nrecords of varying resolutions. The results show that: 1) In the same case of\nusing MC, this model can achieve comparable state estimation results with the\nregular lognormal chain. 2) In the case of only using VI, this model can obtain\naccuracy that are slightly worse than MC, but still acceptable in practice; 3)\nOnly using VI, the running time of Gam-Chain, under the most conservative\nsettings, can be reduced to below 20% of that based on the lognormal chain via\nMC.",

Specifically, FFCNet is a novel complex\nnetwork that enables the combination of complex convolutional networks with\nfrequency learning to overcome the loss of phase information caused by real\nconvolution operations.

Moreover, the image patch scrambling module in FFCNet generates\nrandom local spectral blocks, empowering the network to learn long-range and\nlocal diseasespecific features and improving the discriminative ability of hard\nsamples. We evaluated the proposed FFCNet on an in-house dataset with 2568\ncolonoscopy images, showing our method achieves high performance outperforming\nprevious state-of-the art methods with an accuracy of 86:35% and an accuracy of\n4.46% higher than the backbone.

    "abstract": "Understanding the internal physiological changes accompanying the aging\nprocess is an important aspect of medical image interpretation, with the\nexpected changes acting as a baseline when reporting abnormal findings. Deep\nlearning has recently been demonstrated to allow the accurate estimation of\npatient age from chest X-rays, and shows potential as a health indicator and\nmortality predictor. In this paper we present a novel comparative study of the\nrelative performance of radiologists versus state-of-the-art deep learning\nmodels on two tasks: (a) patient age estimation from a single chest X-ray, and\n(b) ranking of two time-separated images of the same patient by age. We train\nour models with a heterogeneous database of 1.8M chest X-rays with ground truth\npatient ages and investigate the limitations on model accuracy imposed by\nlimited training data and image resolution, and demonstrate generalisation\nperformance on public data. To explore the large performance gap between the\nmodels and humans on these age-prediction tasks compared with other\nradiological reporting tasks seen in the literature, we incorporate our age\nprediction model into a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)\nallowing visualisation of the semantic features identified by the prediction\nmodel as significant to age prediction, comparing the identified features with\nthose relied on by clinicians.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread globally and become a health\ncrisis faced by humanity since first reported. Radiology imaging technologies\nsuch as computer tomography (CT) and chest X-ray imaging (CXR) are effective\ntools for diagnosing COVID-19. However, in CT and CXR images, the infected area\noccupies only a small part of the image. Some common deep learning methods that\nintegrate large-scale receptive fields may cause the loss of image detail,\nresulting in the omission of the region of interest (ROI) in COVID-19 images\nand are therefore not suitable for further processing. To this end, we propose\na deep spatial pyramid pooling (D-SPP) module to integrate contextual\ninformation over different resolutions, aiming to extract information under\ndifferent scales of COVID-19 images effectively. Besides, we propose a COVID-19\ninfection detection (CID) module to draw attention to the lesion area and\nremove interference from irrelevant information. Extensive experiments on four\nCT and CXR datasets have shown that our method produces higher accuracy of\ndetecting COVID-19 lesions in CT and CXR images. It can be used as a\ncomputer-aided diagnosis tool to help doctors effectively diagnose and screen\nfor COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative workflows utilizing real-time data to constrain ahead-of-bit\nuncertainty have the potential to improve geosteering significantly. Fast\nupdates based on real-time data are essential when drilling in complex\nreservoirs with high uncertainties in pre-drill models. However, practical\nassimilation of real-time data requires effective geological modeling and\nmathematically robust parameterization. We propose a generative adversarial\ndeep neural network (GAN), trained to reproduce geologically consistent 2D\nsections of fluvial successions. Offline training produces a fast GAN-based\napproximation of complex geology parameterized as a 60-dimensional model vector\nwith standard Gaussian distribution of each component. Probabilistic forecasts\nare generated using an ensemble of equiprobable model vector realizations. A\nforward-modeling sequence, including a GAN, converts the initial (prior)\nensemble of realizations into EM log predictions. An ensemble smoother\nminimizes statistical misfits between predictions and real-time data, yielding\nan update of model vectors and reduced uncertainty around the well. Updates can\nbe then translated to probabilistic predictions of facies and resistivities.\nThe present paper demonstrates a workflow for geosteering in an outcrop-based,\nsynthetic fluvial succession. In our example, the method reduces uncertainty\nand correctly predicts most major geological features up to 500 meters ahead of\ndrill-bit.",

One of the challenges in addressing this issue is the\nconsistent and equal provision of public services, including transport for\nresidents across the urban system. In this study, using a novel computational\nmethod combining geometrical analysis and information-theoretic measures, we\nanalyse the accessibility to public transport in terms of the spatial coverage\nof the transport nodes (stops) and the quality of service at these nodes across\ndifferent areas. Furthermore, using a network clustering procedure, we also\ncharacterise the land-use pattern of those areas and relate that to their\npublic transport accessibility. Using Singapore as a case study, we find that\nthe commercial areas in the CBD area expectedly have excellent accessibility\nand the residential areas also have good to very good accessibility. However,\nnot every residential area is equally accessible. While the spatial coverage of\nstops in these areas is very good, the quality of service indicates substantial\nvariation among different regions, with high contrast between the central and\neastern areas compared to the others in the west and north of the city-state.\nWe believe this kind of analysis could yield a good understanding of the\ncurrent level of public transport services across the urban system, and their\ndisparity will provide valuable and actionable insights into the future\ndevelopment plans.",

In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study comparing\nmultilingual NTTS systems models trained with both representations. Our results\nreveal that the unified approach consistently achieves better cross-lingual\nsynthesis with respect to both naturalness and accent. Separate representations\ntend to have an order of magnitude more tokens than unified ones, which may\naffect model capacity. For this reason, we carry out an ablation study to\nunderstand the interaction of the representation type with the size of the\ntoken embedding.

We then determine the probability\nof protein folding by computing the steady-state energy of the driven protein\nand then generalize our model to account for protein populations. Our numerical\nanalysis results indicate that a maximum selectivity score is attained when\nonly the targeted population experiences a folding behavior due to the\nimpinging THz signal. From the achieved selectivity values, we conclude that\nthe system response not only depends on the resonant frequency but also on the\nsystem controlling parameters namely, the nanoantenna force, the damping\nconstant, and the abundance of each protein population. The presented work\nsheds light on the potential associated with the electromagnetic-based control\nof protein networks, which could lead to a plethora of applications in the\nmedical field ranging from bio-sensing to targeted therapy.",

    "title": "Quantum Neural Network Compression",
    "abstract": "Model compression, such as pruning and quantization, has been widely applied\nto optimize neural networks on resource-limited classical devices. Recently,\nthere are growing interest in variational quantum circuits (VQC), that is, a\ntype of neural network on quantum computers (a.k.a., quantum neural networks).\nIt is well known that the near-term quantum devices have high noise and limited\nresources (i.e., quantum bits, qubits); yet, how to compress quantum neural\nnetworks has not been thoroughly studied. One might think it is straightforward\nto apply the classical compression techniques to quantum scenarios. However,\nthis paper reveals that there exist differences between the compression of\nquantum and classical neural networks. Based on our observations, we claim that\nthe compilation/traspilation has to be involved in the compression process. On\ntop of this, we propose the very first systematical framework, namely CompVQC,\nto compress quantum neural networks (QNNs).In CompVQC, the key component is a\nnovel compression algorithm, which is based on the alternating direction method\nof multipliers (ADMM) approach. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of the\nCompVQC, reducing the circuit depth (almost over 2.5 %) with a negligible\naccuracy drop (<1%), which outperforms other competitors. Another promising\ntruth is our CompVQC can indeed promote the robustness of the QNN on the\nnear-term noisy quantum devices.",

    "abstract": "Computed tomography (CT) imaging could be very practical for diagnosing\nvarious diseases. However, the nature of the CT images is even more diverse\nsince the resolution and number of the slices of a CT scan are determined by\nthe machine and its settings. Conventional deep learning models are hard to\ntickle such diverse data since the essential requirement of the deep neural\nnetwork is the consistent shape of the input data. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel, effective, two-step-wise approach to tickle this issue for COVID-19\nsymptom classification thoroughly. First, the semantic feature embedding of\neach slice for a CT scan is extracted by conventional backbone networks. Then,\nwe proposed a long short-term memory (LSTM) and Transformer-based sub-network\nto deal with temporal feature learning, leading to spatiotemporal feature\nrepresentation learning. In this fashion, the proposed two-step LSTM model\ncould prevent overfitting, as well as increase performance. Comprehensive\nexperiments reveal that the proposed two-step method not only shows excellent\nperformance but also could be compensated for each other. More specifically,\nthe two-step LSTM model has a lower false-negative rate, while the 2-step Swin\nmodel has a lower false-positive rate. In summary, it is suggested that the\nmodel ensemble could be adopted for more stable and promising performance in\nreal-world applications.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that\ngradually deprives the patient of cognitive function and can end in death. With\nthe advancement of technology today, it is possible to detect Alzheimer's\ndisease through Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. So that MRI is the\ntechnique most often used for the diagnosis and analysis of the progress of\nAlzheimer's disease. With this technology, image recognition in the early\ndiagnosis of Alzheimer's disease can be achieved automatically using machine\nlearning. Although machine learning has many advantages, currently the use of\ndeep learning is more widely applied because it has stronger learning\ncapabilities and is more suitable for solving image recognition problems.\nHowever, there are still several challenges that must be faced to implement\ndeep learning, such as the need for large datasets, requiring large computing\nresources, and requiring careful parameter setting to prevent overfitting or\nunderfitting. In responding to the challenge of classifying Alzheimer's disease\nusing deep learning, this study propose the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\nmethod with the Residual Network 18 Layer (ResNet-18) architecture. To overcome\nthe need for a large and balanced dataset, transfer learning from ImageNet is\nused and weighting the loss function values so that each class has the same\nweight. And also in this study conducted an experiment by changing the network\nactivation function to a mish activation function to increase accuracy. From\nthe results of the tests that have been carried out, the accuracy of the model\nis 88.3 % using transfer learning, weighted loss and the mish activation\nfunction. This accuracy value increases from the baseline model which only gets\nan accuracy of 69.1 %.",

    "abstract": "RNA structure determination and prediction can promote RNA-targeted drug\ndevelopment and engineerable synthetic elements design. But due to the\nintrinsic structural flexibility of RNAs, all the three mainstream structure\ndetermination methods (X-ray crystallography, NMR, and Cryo-EM) encounter\nchallenges when resolving the RNA structures, which leads to the scarcity of\nthe resolved RNA structures. Computational prediction approaches emerge as\ncomplementary to the experimental techniques. However, none of the \\textit{de\nnovo} approaches is based on deep learning since too few structures are\navailable. Instead, most of them apply the time-consuming sampling-based\nstrategies, and their performance seems to hit the plateau. In this work, we\ndevelop the first end-to-end deep learning approach, E2Efold-3D, to accurately\nperform the \\textit{de novo} RNA structure prediction. Several novel components\nare proposed to overcome the data scarcity, such as a fully-differentiable\nend-to-end pipeline, secondary structure-assisted self-distillation, and\nparameter-efficient backbone formulation. Such designs are validated on the\nindependent, non-overlapping RNA puzzle testing dataset and reach an average\nsub-4 \\AA{} root-mean-square deviation, demonstrating its superior performance\ncompared to state-of-the-art approaches. Interestingly, it also achieves\npromising results when predicting RNA complex structures, a feat that none of\nthe previous systems could accomplish. When E2Efold-3D is coupled with the\nexperimental techniques, the RNA structure prediction field can be greatly\nadvanced.",
