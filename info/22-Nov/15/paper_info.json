    "title": "Fast formation and assembly for spline-based 3D fictitious domain  methods",
    "abstract": "Standard finite element methods employ an element-wise assembly strategy. The\nelement's contribution to the system matrix is formed by a loop over quadrature\npoints. This concept is also used in fictitious domain methods, which perform\nsimulations on a simple tensor-product background mesh cut by a boundary\nrepresentation that defines the domain of interest.\nConsidering such $d$-dimensional background meshes based on splines of degree\n$p$ with maximal smoothness, $C^{p-1}$, the cost of setting up the system\nmatrix is $\\mathcal{O}\\left(p^{3d}\\right)$ per degree of freedom. Alternative\nassembly and formation techniques can significantly reduce this cost. In\nparticular, the combination of (1) sum factorization, (2) weighted quadrature,\nand (3) row-based assembly yields a cost of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(p^{d+1}\\right)$\nfor non-cut background meshes. However, applying this fast approach to cut\nbackground meshes is an open challenge since they do not have a tensor-product\nstructure.\nThis work presents techniques that allow the treatment of cut background\nmeshes and thus the application of fast formation and assembly to fictitious\ndomain methods. First, a discontinuous version of weighted quadrature is\npresented, which introduces a discontinuity into a cut test function's support.\nThe cut region can be treated separately from the non-cut counterpart; the\nlatter can be assembled by the fast concepts. A three-dimensional example\ninvestigates the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed concept and\ndemonstrates its speed-up compared to conventional formation and assembly.",

    "abstract": "In the field of computational science and engineering, workflows often entail\nthe application of various software, for instance, for simulation or pre- and\npostprocessing. Typically, these components have to be combined in arbitrarily\ncomplex workflows to address a specific research question. In order for peer\nresearchers to understand, reproduce and (re)use the findings of a scientific\npublication, several challenges have to be addressed. For instance, the\nemployed workflow has to be automated and information on all used software must\nbe available for a reproduction of the results. Moreover, the results must be\ntraceable and the workflow documented and readable to allow for external\nverification and greater trust. In this paper, existing workflow management\nsystems (WfMSs) are discussed regarding their suitability for describing,\nreproducing and reusing scientific workflows. To this end, a set of general\nrequirements for WfMSswere deduced from user stories that we deem relevant in\nthe domain of computational science and engineering. On the basis of an\nexemplary workflow implementation, publicly hosted at GitHub (https://\ngithub.com/BAMresearch/NFDI4IngScientificWorkflowRequirements), a selection of\ndifferent WfMSs is compared with respect to these requirements, to support\nfellow scientists in identifying the WfMSs that best suit their requirements.",

Training of the scene graphs is dominated by the majority\nrelationships of the majority pairs and, therefore, the object-conditional\ndistributions of relationship in the minority pairs are not preserved after the\ntraining is converged. Consequently, the biased model performs well on more\nfrequent relationships in the marginal distribution of relationships such as\n`on' and `wearing', and performs poorly on the less frequent relationships such\nas `eating' or `hanging from'. In this work, we propose virtual evidence\nincorporated within-triplet Bayesian Network (BN) to preserve the\nobject-conditional distribution of the relationship label and to eradicate the\nbias created by the marginal probability of the relationships. The insufficient\nnumber of relationships in the minority classes poses a significant problem in\nlearning the within-triplet Bayesian network. We address this insufficiency by\nembedding-based augmentation of triplets where we borrow samples of the\nminority triplet classes from its neighborhood triplets in the semantic space.\nWe perform experiments on two different datasets and achieve a significant\nimprovement in the mean recall of the relationships.

Numerous system security updates have been approved\nand installed in order to sort out security holes and bugs, and prevent attacks\nthat could expose personal or other valuable information.

    "abstract": "We study the classic problem of \\emph{fairly} dividing a heterogeneous and\ndivisible resource -- modeled as a line segment $[0,1]$ and typically called as\na \\emph{cake} -- among $n$ agents. This work considers an interesting variant\nof the problem where agents are embedded on a graph. The graphical constraint\nentails that each agent evaluates her allocated share only against her\nneighbors' share. Given a graph, the goal is to efficiently find a\n\\emph{locally envy-free} allocation where every agent values her share of the\ncake to be at least as much as that of any of her neighbors' share.\nThe most significant contribution of this work is a bounded protocol that\nfinds a locally envy-free allocation among $n$ agents on a tree graph using\n$n^{O(n)}$ queries under the standard Robertson-Webb (RW) query model. The\nquery complexity of our proposed protocol, though exponential, significantly\nimproves the currently best known hyper-exponential query complexity bound of\nAziz and Mackenzie [AM16] for complete graphs. In particular, we also show that\nif the underlying tree graph has a depth of at most two, one can find a locally\nenvy-free allocation with $O(n^4 \\log n)$ RW queries. This is the first and the\nonly known locally envy-free cake cutting protocol with polynomial query\ncomplexity for a non-trivial graph structure.\nInterestingly, our discrete protocols are simple and easy to understand, as\nopposed to highly involved protocol of [AM16]. This simplicity can be\nattributed to their recursive nature and the use of a single agent as a\ndesignated \\emph{cutter}. We believe that these results will help us improve\nour algorithmic understanding of the arguably challenging problem of envy-free\ncake-cutting by uncovering the bottlenecks in its query complexity and its\nrelation to the underlying graph structures.",

Contemporary neurocomputational approaches to imitation\nlearning achieve limited generalization at the cost of data-intensive training,\nand often produce opaque models that are difficult to understand and debug. In\nthis study, we explore the viability of developing purely-neural controllers\nfor social robots that learn to imitate by reasoning about the underlying\nintentions of demonstrated behaviors.

Our\nempirical results demonstrate that NeuroCERIL can learn various procedural\nskills in a simulated robotic imitation learning domain. We also show that its\ncausal reasoning procedure is computationally efficient, and that its memory\nuse is dominated by highly transient short-term memories, much like human\nworking memory.

To address the time series segmentation problem,\nthe study developed an Energy Maximization Algorithm (EMA) capable of\nextracting driving events of varying durations and frequencies from continuous\nsignal data. To reduce overfitting and false alarm rates, heuristic algorithms\nwere used to classify events with highly variable patterns such as stops and\nlane-keeping. To classify segmented driving events, four machine learning\nmodels were implemented, and their accuracy and transferability were assessed\nover multiple data sources. The duration of events extracted by EMA were\ncomparable to actual events, with accuracies ranging from 59.30% (left lane\nchange) to 85.60% (lane-keeping).

    "title": "High-Level Synthesis for Packet-Processing Pipelines",
    "abstract": "Compiling high-level programs to target high-speed packet-processing\npipelines is a challenging combinatorial optimization problem. The compiler\nmust configure the pipeline's resources to match the high-level semantics of\nthe program, while packing all of the program's computation into the pipeline's\nlimited resources. State of the art approaches tackle individual aspects of\nthis problem. Yet, they miss opportunities to efficiently produce globally\nhigh-quality outcomes. We argue that High-Level Synthesis (HLS), previously\napplied to ASIC/FPGA design, is the right framework to decompose the\ncompilation problem for pipelines into smaller pieces with modular solutions.\nWe design an HLS-based compiler that works in three phases. Transformation\nrewrites programs to use more abundant pipeline resources, avoiding scarce\nones. Synthesis breaks complex transactional code into configurations of\npipelined compute units. Allocation maps the program's compute and memory to\nthe hardware resources. We prototype these ideas in a compiler, CaT, which\ntargets the Tofino pipeline and a cycle-accurate simulator of a Verilog\nhardware model of an RMT pipeline. CaT can handle programs that existing\ncompilers cannot currently run on pipelines, generating code faster than\nexisting compilers, while using fewer pipeline resources.",

The future belongs to those who can best\ncollaborate with artificial cognitive entities achieving a high degree of\ncognitive augmenta-tion. However, we currently lack theoretically grounded\nfundamental metrics able to describe human or artificial cognition much less\naugmented and combined cognition. How do we measure thinking, cognition,\ninformation, and knowledge in an implementation-independent way? How can we\ntell how much thinking an artificial entity does and how much is done by a\nhuman? How can we measure the combined and possible even emergent effect of\nhumans working together with intelligent artificial entities? These are some of\nthe challenges for research-ers in this field. We first define a cognitive\nprocess as the transformation of data, information, knowledge, and wisdom. We\nthen review several existing and emerging information metrics based on entropy,\nprocessing effort, quantum physics, emergent capacity, and human concept\nlearning.

    "abstract": "Unpacking and comprehending how deep learning algorithms make decisions has\nbeen a persistent challenge for researchers and end-users. Explaining\ntime-series predictive models is useful for clinical applications with high\nstakes to understand the behavior of prediction models. However, existing\napproaches to explain such models are frequently unique to architectures and\ndata where the features do not have a time-varying component. In this paper, we\nintroduce WindowSHAP, a model-agnostic framework for explaining time-series\nclassifiers using Shapley values. We intend for WindowSHAP to mitigate the\ncomputational complexity of calculating Shapley values for long time-series\ndata as well as improve the quality of explanations. WindowSHAP is based on\npartitioning a sequence into time windows. Under this framework, we present\nthree distinct algorithms of Stationary, Sliding and Dynamic WindowSHAP, each\nevaluated against baseline approaches, KernelSHAP and TimeSHAP, using\nperturbation and sequence analyses metrics. We applied our framework to\nclinical time-series data from both a specialized clinical domain (Traumatic\nBrain Injury - TBI) as well as a broad clinical domain (critical care\nmedicine). The experimental results demonstrate that, based on the two\nquantitative metrics, our framework is superior at explaining clinical\ntime-series classifiers, while also reducing the complexity of computations. We\nshow that for time-series data with 120 time steps (hours), merging 10 adjacent\ntime points can reduce the CPU time of WindowSHAP by 80% compared to\nKernelSHAP. We also show that our Dynamic WindowSHAP algorithm focuses more on\nthe most important time steps and provides more understandable explanations. As\na result, WindowSHAP not only accelerates the calculation of Shapley values for\ntime-series data, but also delivers more understandable explanations with\nhigher quality.",

    "abstract": "A common challenge in regression is that for many problems, the degrees of\nfreedom required for a high-quality solution also allows for overfitting.\nRegularization is a class of strategies that seek to restrict the range of\npossible solutions so as to discourage overfitting while still enabling good\nsolutions, and different regularization strategies impose different types of\nrestrictions. In this paper, we present a multilevel regularization strategy\nthat constructs and trains a hierarchy of neural networks, each of which has\nlayers that are wider versions of the previous network's layers. We draw\nintuition and techniques from the field of Algebraic Multigrid (AMG),\ntraditionally used for solving linear and nonlinear systems of equations, and\nspecifically adapt the Full Approximation Scheme (FAS) for nonlinear systems of\nequations to the problem of deep learning. Training through V-cycles then\nencourage the neural networks to build a hierarchical understanding of the\nproblem. We refer to this approach as \\emph{multilevel-in-width} to distinguish\nfrom prior multilevel works which hierarchically alter the depth of neural\nnetworks. The resulting approach is a highly flexible framework that can be\napplied to a variety of layer types, which we demonstrate with both\nfully-connected and convolutional layers. We experimentally show with PDE\nregression problems that our multilevel training approach is an effective\nregularizer, improving the generalize performance of the neural networks\nstudied.",

    "abstract": "Preference-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms help avoid the\npitfalls of hand-crafted reward functions by distilling them from human\npreference feedback, but they remain impractical due to the burdensome number\nof labels required from the human, even for relatively simple tasks. In this\nwork, we demonstrate that encoding environment dynamics in the reward function\n(REED) dramatically reduces the number of preference labels required in\nstate-of-the-art preference-based RL frameworks. We hypothesize that REED-based\nmethods better partition the state-action space and facilitate generalization\nto state-action pairs not included in the preference dataset. REED iterates\nbetween encoding environment dynamics in a state-action representation via a\nself-supervised temporal consistency task, and bootstrapping the\npreference-based reward function from the state-action representation. Whereas\nprior approaches train only on the preference-labelled trajectory pairs, REED\nexposes the state-action representation to all transitions experienced during\npolicy training. We explore the benefits of REED within the PrefPPO [1] and\nPEBBLE [2] preference learning frameworks and demonstrate improvements across\nexperimental conditions to both the speed of policy learning and the final\npolicy performance. For example, on quadruped-walk and walker-walk with 50\npreference labels, REED-based reward functions recover 83% and 66% of ground\ntruth reward policy performance and without REED only 38\\% and 21\\% are\nrecovered.

    "abstract": "Learning causal structure is useful in many areas of artificial intelligence,\nincluding planning, robotics, and explanation. Constraint-based structure\nlearning algorithms such as PC use conditional independence (CI) tests to infer\ncausal structure. Traditionally, constraint-based algorithms perform CI tests\nwith a preference for smaller-sized conditioning sets, partially because the\nstatistical power of conventional CI tests declines rapidly as the size of the\nconditioning set increases. However, many modern conditional independence tests\nare model-based, and these tests use well-regularized models that maintain\nstatistical power even with very large conditioning sets. This suggests an\nintriguing new strategy for constraint-based algorithms which may result in a\nreduction of the total number of CI tests performed: Test variable pairs with\nlarge conditioning sets first, as a pre-processing step that finds some\nconditional independencies quickly, before moving on to the more conventional\nstrategy that favors small conditioning sets. We propose such a pre-processing\nstep for the PC algorithm which relies on performing CI tests on a few randomly\nselected large conditioning sets. We perform an empirical analysis on directed\nacyclic graphs (DAGs) that correspond to real-world systems and both empirical\nand theoretical analyses for Erd\\H{o}s-Renyi DAGs. Our results show that\nPre-Processing Plus PC (P3PC) performs far fewer CI tests than the original PC\nalgorithm, between 0.5% to 36%, and often less than 10%, of the CI tests that\nthe PC algorithm alone performs. The efficiency gains are particularly\nsignificant for the DAGs corresponding to real-world systems.",

Most existing GSL works apply a joint learning framework\nwhere the estimated adjacency matrix and GNN parameters are optimized for\ndownstream tasks. However, as GSL is essentially a link prediction task, whose\ngoal may largely differ from the goal of the downstream task. The inconsistency\nof these two goals limits the GSL methods to learn the potential optimal graph\nstructure. Moreover, the joint learning framework suffers from scalability\nissues in terms of time and space during the process of estimation and\noptimization of the adjacency matrix. To mitigate these issues, we propose a\ngraph structure refinement (GSR) framework with a pretrain-finetune pipeline.\nSpecifically, The pre-training phase aims to comprehensively estimate the\nunderlying graph structure by a multi-view contrastive learning framework with\nboth intra- and inter-view link prediction tasks. Then, the graph structure is\nrefined by adding and removing edges according to the edge probabilities\nestimated by the pre-trained model. Finally, the fine-tuning GNN is initialized\nby the pre-trained model and optimized toward downstream tasks. With the\nrefined graph structure remaining static in the fine-tuning space, GSR avoids\nestimating and optimizing graph structure in the fine-tuning phase which enjoys\ngreat scalability and efficiency.

We also introduce a general framework for reasoning about privacy\nthreats to synthetic data and showcase TAPAS on several examples.",

    "abstract": "Dialogue systems, commonly known as chatbots, have gained escalating\npopularity in recent times due to their wide-spread applications in carrying\nout chit-chat conversations with users and task-oriented dialogues to\naccomplish various user tasks. Existing chatbots are usually trained from\npre-collected and manually-labeled data and/or written with handcrafted rules.\nMany also use manually-compiled knowledge bases (KBs). Their ability to\nunderstand natural language is still limited, and they tend to produce many\nerrors resulting in poor user satisfaction. Typically, they need to be\nconstantly improved by engineers with more labeled data and more manually\ncompiled knowledge. This book introduces the new paradigm of lifelong learning\ndialogue systems to endow chatbots the ability to learn continually by\nthemselves through their own self-initiated interactions with their users and\nworking environments to improve themselves. As the systems chat more and more\nwith users or learn more and more from external sources, they become more and\nmore knowledgeable and better and better at conversing. The book presents the\nlatest developments and techniques for building such continual learning\ndialogue systems that continuously learn new language expressions and lexical\nand factual knowledge during conversation from users and off conversation from\nexternal sources, acquire new training examples during conversation, and learn\nconversational skills. Apart from these general topics, existing works on\ncontinual learning of some specific aspects of dialogue systems are also\nsurveyed. The book concludes with a discussion of open challenges for future\nresearch.",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised speech representation learning aims to extract meaningful\nfactors from the speech signal that can later be used across different\ndownstream tasks, such as speech and/or emotion recognition. Existing models,\nsuch as HuBERT, however, can be fairly large thus may not be suitable for edge\nspeech applications. Moreover, realistic applications typically involve speech\ncorrupted by noise and room reverberation, hence models need to provide\nrepresentations that are robust to such environmental factors. In this study,\nwe build on the so-called DistilHuBERT model, which distils HuBERT to a\nfraction of its original size, with three modifications, namely: (i) augment\nthe training data with noise and reverberation, while the student model needs\nto distill the clean representations from the teacher model; (ii) introduce a\ncurriculum learning approach where increasing levels of noise are introduced as\nthe model trains, thus helping with convergence and with the creation of more\nrobust representations; and (iii) introduce a multi-task learning approach\nwhere the model also reconstructs the clean waveform jointly with the\ndistillation task, thus also acting as an enhancement step to ensure additional\nenvironment robustness to the representation. Experiments on three SUPERB tasks\nshow the advantages of the proposed method not only relative to the original\nDistilHuBERT, but also to the original HuBERT, thus showing the advantages of\nthe proposed method for ``in the wild'' edge speech applications.",

For emergency collision avoidance, the controller should\nhave the ability to deal with complicated environments and take collision\nmitigation into consideration since the problem may have no feasible solution.\nWe propose a safety controller by using model predictive control and artificial\npotential function. A new artificial potential function inspired by line charge\nis proposed as the cost function for our model predictive controller. The new\nartificial potential function takes the shape of all objects into\nconsideration. In particular, the artificial potential function that we\nproposed has the flexibility to fit the shape of the road structures such as\nthe intersection, while the artificial potential function in most of the\nprevious work could only be used in a highway scenario. Moreover, we could\nrealize collision mitigation for a specific part of the vehicle by increasing\nthe quantity of the charge at the corresponding place. We have tested our\nmethods in 192 cases from 8 different scenarios in simulation.

A high pixel-wise accuracy, complete topology structure and\nrobustness to various contrast variations are three critical aspects of vessel\nsegmentation. However, most existing methods only focus on achieving part of\nthem via dedicated designs while few of them can concurrently achieve the three\ngoals. In this paper, we present a novel affinity feature strengthening network\n(AFN) which adopts a contrast-insensitive approach based on multiscale affinity\nto jointly model topology and refine pixel-wise segmentation features.\nSpecifically, for each pixel we derive a multiscale affinity field which\ncaptures the semantic relationships of the pixel with its neighbors on the\npredicted mask image. Such a multiscale affinity field can effectively\nrepresent the local topology of a vessel segment of different sizes. Meanwhile,\nit does not depend on image intensities and hence is robust to various\nillumination and contrast changes. We further learn spatial- and scale-aware\nadaptive weights for the corresponding affinity fields to strengthen vessel\nfeatures. We evaluate our AFN on four different types of vascular datasets:\nX-ray angiography coronary vessel dataset (XCAD), portal vein dataset (PV),\ndigital subtraction angiography cerebrovascular vessel dataset (DSA) and\nretinal vessel dataset (DRIVE). Extensive experimental results on the four\ndatasets demonstrate that our AFN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in\nterms of both higher accuracy and topological metrics, and meanwhile is more\nrobust to various contrast changes than existing methods.

Numerical examples validate the effectiveness\nof the proposed methods concerning physical and safety constraints.

    "abstract": "In applications involving sensitive data, such as finance and healthcare, the\nnecessity for preserving data privacy can be a significant barrier to machine\nlearning model development. Differential privacy (DP) has emerged as one\ncanonical standard for provable privacy. However, DP's strong theoretical\nguarantees often come at the cost of a large drop in its utility for machine\nlearning, and DP guarantees themselves can be difficult to interpret. In this\nwork, we propose a novel privacy notion, membership inference privacy (MIP), to\naddress these challenges. We give a precise characterization of the\nrelationship between MIP and DP, and show that MIP can be achieved using less\namount of randomness compared to the amount required for guaranteeing DP,\nleading to a smaller drop in utility. MIP guarantees are also easily\ninterpretable in terms of the success rate of membership inference attacks. Our\ntheoretical results also give rise to a simple algorithm for guaranteeing MIP\nwhich can be used as a wrapper around any algorithm with a continuous output,\nincluding parametric model training.",

    "abstract": "We tackle the task of NeRF inversion for style-based neural radiance fields,\n(e.g., StyleNeRF). In the task, we aim to learn an inversion function to\nproject an input image to the latent space of a NeRF generator and then\nsynthesize novel views of the original image based on the latent code. Compared\nwith GAN inversion for 2D generative models, NeRF inversion not only needs to\n1) preserve the identity of the input image, but also 2) ensure 3D consistency\nin generated novel views. This requires the latent code obtained from the\nsingle-view image to be invariant across multiple views. To address this new\nchallenge, we propose a two-stage encoder for style-based NeRF inversion. In\nthe first stage, we introduce a base encoder that converts the input image to a\nlatent code. To ensure the latent code is view-invariant and is able to\nsynthesize 3D consistent novel view images, we utilize identity contrastive\nlearning to train the base encoder. Second, to better preserve the identity of\nthe input image, we introduce a refining encoder to refine the latent code and\nadd finer details to the output image. Importantly note that the novelty of\nthis model lies in the design of its first-stage encoder which produces the\nclosest latent code lying on the latent manifold and thus the refinement in the\nsecond stage would be close to the NeRF manifold. Through extensive\nexperiments, we demonstrate that our proposed two-stage encoder qualitatively\nand quantitatively exhibits superiority over the existing encoders for\ninversion in both image reconstruction and novel-view rendering.",

    "abstract": "Object detection is an important topic in computer vision, with\npost-processing, an essential part of the typical object detection pipeline,\nposing a significant bottleneck affecting the performance of traditional object\ndetection models. The detection transformer (DETR), as the first end-to-end\ntarget detection model, discards the requirement of manual components like the\nanchor and non-maximum suppression (NMS), significantly simplifying the target\ndetection process. However, compared with most traditional object detection\nmodels, DETR converges very slowly, and a query's meaning is obscure. Thus,\ninspired by the Step-by-Step concept, this paper proposes a new two-stage\nobject detection model, named DETR with YOLO (DEYO), which relies on a\nprogressive inference to solve the above problems. DEYO is a two-stage\narchitecture comprising a classic target detection model and a DETR-like model\nas the first and second stages, respectively. Specifically, the first stage\nprovides high-quality query and anchor feeding into the second stage, improving\nthe performance and efficiency of the second stage compared to the original\nDETR model. Meanwhile, the second stage compensates for the performance\ndegradation caused by the first stage detector's limitations. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that DEYO attains 50.6 AP and 52.1 AP in 12 and 36\nepochs, respectively, while utilizing ResNet-50 as the backbone and multi-scale\nfeatures on the COCO dataset. Compared with DINO, an optimal DETR-like model,\nthe developed DEYO model affords a significant performance improvement of 1.6\nAP and 1.2 AP in two epoch settings.",

However, due to the time-varying topology,\ndynamic bandwidth and long propagation, for establishing deterministic\nservices, it is not only difficult in finding stable end-to-end (E2E) routing,\nbut also complex for joint routing and scheduling. Towards this, we propose an\noptimal solution based on temporal graphs to enhance resource utilization and\nservice capability of NTNs. First, an extended time-expanded graph (ETEG) with\nintroduced virtual nodes and edges is constructed to uniformly model both\nheterogeneous resources and traffic requirements. Then, we recast the\ndeterministic routing problem as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem,\nby linearizing the constraints containing variable-dependent summations,\nround-down operation and multiplication of nonlinear terms. With the solid\nupper bound by ILP-based scheduling, we further propose a low-complexity\nETEG-based shortest time-featured path algorithm to jointly use transmission\nand storage resources to support dynamic queuing and cross-cycle transmission\nof packets, thereby determining the best outgoing link and forwarding cycle\nhop-by-hop.

This function depends on a large number\nof parameters, also known as weights, that depends on the network architecture.\nIn general the goal of this optimization problem is to find the global minimum\nof the network function. In this paper it is discussed how due to how neural\nnetworks are designed, the neural network function present a very large\nsymmetry in the parameter space. This work shows how the neural network\nfunction has a number of equivalent minima, in other words minima that give the\nsame value for the loss function and the same exact output, that grows\nfactorially with the number of neurons in each layer for feed forward neural\nnetwork or with the number of filters in a convolutional neural networks. When\nthe number of neurons and layers is large, the number of equivalent minima\ngrows extremely fast.

The problem was first\ninvestigated by Wachter-Zeh and the result was amended by Hayashi and Yasunaga\nwhere a lower bound on the list-decodability for insdel codes was derived.\nThe main purpose of this paper is to move a step further towards solving the\nabove open problem. In this work, we provide a new lower bound for the\nlist-decodability of an insdel code. As a consequence, we show that unlike the\nJohnson bound for codes under other metrics that is tight, the bound on\nlist-decodability of insdel codes given by Hayashi and Yasunaga is not tight.\nOur main idea is to show that if an insdel code with a given Levenshtein\ndistance $d$ is not list-decodable with list size $L$, then the list decoding\nradius is lower bounded by a bound involving $L$ and $d$. In other words, if\nthe list decoding radius is less than this lower bound, the code must be\nlist-decodable with list size $L$.

For the FER bias\nissue, recent researches mainly focus on the cross-domain issue with advanced\ndomain adaption algorithms. This paper addresses another problem: how to boost\nFER performance by leveraging cross-domain datasets. Unlike the coarse and\nbiased expression label, the facial Action Unit (AU) is fine-grained and\nobjective suggested by psychological studies. Motivated by this, we resort to\nthe AU information of different FER datasets for performance boosting and make\ncontributions as follows. First, we experimentally show that the naive joint\ntraining of multiple FER datasets is harmful to the FER performance of\nindividual datasets. We further introduce expression-specific mean images and\nAU cosine distances to measure FER dataset bias. This novel measurement shows\nconsistent conclusions with experimental degradation of joint training. Second,\nwe propose a simple yet conceptually-new framework, AU-aware Vision Transformer\n(AU-ViT). It improves the performance of individual datasets by jointly\ntraining auxiliary datasets with AU or pseudo-AU labels. We also find that the\nAU-ViT is robust to real-world occlusions. Moreover, for the first time, we\nprove that a carefully-initialized ViT achieves comparable performance to\nadvanced deep convolutional networks.

While impressive progress has been made, both lines of\nmethods have their own drawbacks - the \"global\" approach is sensitive to noisy\nlabels while the \"local\" counterpart suffers from source bias. In this paper,\nwe present Divide and Contrast (DaC), a new paradigm for SFUDA that strives to\nconnect the good ends of both worlds while bypassing their limitations. Based\non the prediction confidence of the source model, DaC divides the target data\ninto source-like and target-specific samples, where either group of samples is\ntreated with tailored goals under an adaptive contrastive learning framework.\nSpecifically, the source-like samples are utilized for learning global class\nclustering thanks to their relatively clean labels.

However, the robustness of GNNs in the presence of\nlabel noise remains a largely under-explored problem. In this paper, we\nconsider an important yet challenging scenario where labels on nodes of graphs\nare not only noisy but also scarce. In this scenario, the performance of GNNs\nis prone to degrade due to label noise propagation and insufficient learning.\nTo address these issues, we propose a novel RTGNN (Robust Training of Graph\nNeural Networks via Noise Governance) framework that achieves better robustness\nby learning to explicitly govern label noise. More specifically, we introduce\nself-reinforcement and consistency regularization as supplemental supervision.\nThe self-reinforcement supervision is inspired by the memorization effects of\ndeep neural networks and aims to correct noisy labels. Further, the consistency\nregularization prevents GNNs from overfitting to noisy labels via mimicry loss\nin both the inter-view and intra-view perspectives. To leverage such\nsupervisions, we divide labels into clean and noisy types, rectify inaccurate\nlabels, and further generate pseudo-labels on unlabeled nodes. Supervision for\nnodes with different types of labels is then chosen adaptively. This enables\nsufficient learning from clean labels while limiting the impact of noisy ones.\nWe conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our RTGNN\nframework, and the results validate its consistent superior performance over\nstate-of-the-art methods with two types of label noises and various noise\nrates.",

Using the proposed scheme,\nwe rigorously show that the optimal convergence rate for the transmission\neigenvalues both on convex and nonconvex domains can be expected. Moreover, by\nthis scheme, we will obtain a sparse generalized eigenvalue problem whose size\nis so demanding even with a coarse mesh that its smallest few real eigenvalues\nfail to be solved by the shift and invert method. We partially overcome this\ncritical issue by deflating the almost all of the $\\infty$ eigenvalue of huge\nmultiplicity, resulting in a drastic reduction of the matrix size without\ndeteriorating the sparsity. Extensive numerical examples are reported to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel algorithm for the continuous control of dynamical\nsystems that combines Trajectory Optimization (TO) and Reinforcement Learning\n(RL) in a single framework. The motivations behind this algorithm are the two\nmain limitations of TO and RL when applied to continuous nonlinear systems to\nminimize a non-convex cost function. Specifically, TO can get stuck in poor\nlocal minima when the search is not initialized close to a ``good'' minimum. On\nthe other hand, when dealing with continuous state and control spaces, the RL\ntraining process may be excessively long and strongly dependent on the\nexploration strategy. Thus, our algorithm learns a ``good'' control policy via\nTO-guided RL policy search that, when used as initial guess provider for TO,\nmakes the trajectory optimization process less prone to converge to poor local\noptima. Our method is validated on several reaching problems featuring\nnon-convex obstacle avoidance with different dynamical systems, including a car\nmodel with 6d state, and a 3-joint planar manipulator. Our results show the\ngreat capabilities of CACTO in escaping local minima, while being more\ncomputationally efficient than the DDPG RL algorithm.",

Although recent studies successfully perform\ntable detection with enhanced results, they often experience performance\ndegradation when they are used for transferred domains whose table layout\nfeatures might differ from the source domain in which the underlying model has\nbeen trained. To overcome this problem, we present DATa, a novel Domain\nAdaptation-aided deep Table detection method that guarantees satisfactory\nperformance in a specific target domain where few trusted labels are available.\nTo this end, we newly design lexical features and an augmented model used for\nre-training. More specifically, after pre-training one of state-of-the-art\nvision-based models as our backbone network, we re-train our augmented model,\nconsisting of the vision-based model and the multilayer perceptron (MLP)\narchitecture. Using new confidence scores acquired based on the trained MLP\narchitecture as well as an initial prediction of bounding boxes and their\nconfidence scores, we calculate each confidence score more accurately. To\nvalidate the superiority of DATa, we perform experimental evaluations by\nadopting a real-world benchmark dataset in a source domain and another dataset\nin our target domain consisting of materials science articles. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that the proposed DATa method substantially outperforms\ncompeting methods that only utilize visual representations in the target\ndomain.

    "abstract": "Mural image inpainting refers to repairing the damage or missing areas in a\nmural image to restore the visual appearance. Most existing image-inpainting\nmethods tend to take a target image as the only input and directly repair the\ndamage to generate a visually plausible result. These methods obtain high\nperformance in restoration or completion of some specific objects, e.g., human\nface, fabric texture, and printed texts, etc., however, are not suitable for\nrepairing murals with varied subjects, especially for murals with large damaged\nareas. Moreover, due to the discrete colors in paints, mural inpainting may\nsuffer from apparent color bias as compared to natural image inpainting. To\nthis end, in this paper, we propose a line drawing guided progressive mural\ninpainting method. It divides the inpainting process into two steps: structure\nreconstruction and color correction, executed by a structure reconstruction\nnetwork (SRN) and a color correction network (CCN), respectively. In the\nstructure reconstruction, line drawings are used by SRN as a guarantee for\nlarge-scale content authenticity and structural stability. In the color\ncorrection, CCN operates a local color adjustment for missing pixels which\nreduces the negative effects of color bias and edge jumping. The proposed\napproach is evaluated against the current state-of-the-art image inpainting\nmethods. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the superiority of\nthe proposed method in mural image inpainting.

    "abstract": "We propose a post-processor, called NeighborTrack, that leverages neighbor\ninformation of the tracking target to validate and improve single-object\ntracking (SOT) results. It requires no additional data or retraining. Instead,\nit uses the confidence score predicted by the backbone SOT network to\nautomatically derive neighbor information and then uses this information to\nimprove the tracking results. When tracking an occluded target, its appearance\nfeatures are untrustworthy. However, a general siamese network often cannot\ntell whether the tracked object is occluded by reading the confidence score\nalone, because it could be misled by neighbors with high confidence scores. Our\nproposed NeighborTrack takes advantage of unoccluded neighbors' information to\nreconfirm the tracking target and reduces false tracking when the target is\noccluded. It not only reduces the impact caused by occlusion, but also fixes\ntracking problems caused by object appearance changes. NeighborTrack is\nagnostic to SOT networks and post-processing methods. For the VOT challenge\ndataset commonly used in short-term object tracking, we improve three famous\nSOT networks, Ocean, TransT, and OSTrack, by an average of ${1.92\\%}$ EAO and\n${2.11\\%}$ robustness. For the mid- and long-term tracking experiments based on\nOSTrack, we achieve state-of-the-art ${72.25\\%}$ AUC on LaSOT and ${75.7\\%}$ AO\non GOT-10K.",

The\nXGBoost model has better performance, with an encrypted inference as low as\n6ms, compared to 296ms for the neural network.

    "abstract": "Post-click conversion rate (CVR) prediction is an essential task for\ndiscovering user interests and increasing platform revenues in a range of\nindustrial applications. One of the most challenging problems of this task is\nthe existence of severe selection bias caused by the inherent self-selection\nbehavior of users and the item selection process of systems. Currently, doubly\nrobust (DR) learning approaches achieve the state-of-the-art performance for\ndebiasing CVR prediction. However, in this paper, by theoretically analyzing\nthe bias, variance and generalization bounds of DR methods, we find that\nexisting DR approaches may have poor generalization caused by inaccurate\nestimation of propensity scores and imputation errors, which often occur in\npractice. Motivated by such analysis, we propose a generalized learning\nframework that not only unifies existing DR methods, but also provides a\nvaluable opportunity to develop a series of new debiasing techniques to\naccommodate different application scenarios. Based on the framework, we propose\ntwo new DR methods, namely DR-BIAS and DR-MSE. DR-BIAS directly controls the\nbias of DR loss, while DR-MSE balances the bias and variance flexibly, which\nachieves better generalization performance. In addition, we propose a novel\ntri-level joint learning optimization method for DR-MSE in CVR prediction, and\nan efficient training algorithm correspondingly. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on both real-world and semi-synthetic datasets, which validate the\neffectiveness of our proposed methods.",

To\novercome these difficulties, we introduce a multistep feature aggregation\n(MSFA) framework for salient object detection, which is composed of three\nmodules, including the Diverse Reception (DR) module, multiscale interaction\n(MSI) module and Feature Enhancement (FE) module to accomplish better\nmulti-level feature fusion. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that MSFA achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

    "abstract": "3D Garment modeling is a critical and challenging topic in the area of\ncomputer vision and graphics, with increasing attention focused on garment\nrepresentation learning, garment reconstruction, and controllable garment\nmanipulation, whereas existing methods were constrained to model garments under\nspecific categories or with relatively simple topologies. In this paper, we\npropose a novel Neural Sewing Machine (NSM), a learning-based framework for\nstructure-preserving 3D garment modeling, which is capable of learning\nrepresentations for garments with diverse shapes and topologies and is\nsuccessfully applied to 3D garment reconstruction and controllable\nmanipulation. To model generic garments, we first obtain sewing pattern\nembedding via a unified sewing pattern encoding module, as the sewing pattern\ncan accurately describe the intrinsic structure and the topology of the 3D\ngarment. Then we use a 3D garment decoder to decode the sewing pattern\nembedding into a 3D garment using the UV-position maps with masks. To preserve\nthe intrinsic structure of the predicted 3D garment, we introduce an\ninner-panel structure-preserving loss, an inter-panel structure-preserving\nloss, and a surface-normal loss in the learning process of our framework. We\nevaluate NSM on the public 3D garment dataset with sewing patterns with diverse\ngarment shapes and categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the\nproposed NSM is capable of representing 3D garments under diverse garment\nshapes and topologies, realistically reconstructing 3D garments from 2D images\nwith the preserved structure, and accurately manipulating the 3D garment\ncategories, shapes, and topologies, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods\nby a clear margin.",

In\nDeepJSCC-AF, the relay simply amplifies and forwards its received signal. In\nDeepJSCC-DF, on the other hand, the relay first reconstructs the transmitted\nimage and then re-encodes it before forwarding. Considering the excessive\ncomputation overhead of DeepJSCC-DF for recovering the image at the relay, we\npropose an alternative scheme, called DeepJSCC-PF, in which the relay processes\nand forwards its received signal without necessarily recovering the image.\nSimulation results show that the proposed DeepJSCC-AF, DF, and PF schemes are\nsuperior to the digital baselines with BPG compression with polar codes and\nprovides a graceful performance degradation with deteriorating channel quality.\nFurther investigation shows that the PSNR gain of DeepJSCC-DF/PF over\nDeepJSCC-AF improves as the channel condition between the source and relay\nimproves.

    "abstract": "Purpose: An Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the simplest and fastest bio-medical\ntest that is used to detect any heart-related disease. ECG signals are\ngenerally stored in paper form, which makes it difficult to store and analyze\nthe data. While capturing ECG leads from paper ECG records, a lot of background\ninformation is also captured, which results in incorrect data interpretation.\nMethods: We propose a deep learning-based model for individually extracting\nall 12 leads from 12-lead ECG images captured using a camera. To simplify the\nanalysis of the ECG and the calculation of complex parameters, we also propose\na method to convert the paper ECG format into a storable digital format. The\nYou Only Look Once, Version 3 (YOLOv3) algorithm has been used to extract the\nleads present in the image. These leads are then passed on to another deep\nlearning model which separates the ECG signal and background from the\nsingle-lead image. After that, vertical scanning is performed on the ECG signal\nto convert it into a 1-Dimensional (1D) digital form. To perform the task of\ndigitalization, we used the pix-2-pix deep learning model and binarized the ECG\nsignals.\nResults: Our proposed method was able to achieve an accuracy of 97.4 %.\nConclusion: The information on the paper ECG fades away over time. Hence, the\ndigitized ECG signals make it possible to store the records and access them\nanytime. This proves highly beneficial for heart patients who require frequent\nECG reports. The stored data can also be useful for research purposes, as this\ndata can be used to develop computer algorithms that are capable of analyzing\nthe data.",

Our model composes neural\nnetworks for high and low-resolution feature extraction with a neural network\nfor behavior prediction, with all three networks trained simultaneously.

    "abstract": "Binarization has proven to be amongst the most effective ways of neural\nnetwork compression, reducing the FLOPs of the original model by a large\nextent. However, such levels of compression are often accompanied by a\nsignificant drop in the performance. There exist some approaches that reduce\nthis performance drop by facilitating partial binarization of the network,\nhowever, a systematic approach to mix binary and full-precision parameters in a\nsingle network is still missing. In this paper, we propose a paradigm to\nperform partial binarization of neural networks in a controlled sense, thereby\nconstructing budgeted binary neural network (B2NN). We present MixBin, an\niterative search-based strategy that constructs B2NN through optimized mixing\nof the binary and full-precision components. MixBin allows to explicitly choose\nthe approximate fraction of the network to be kept as binary, thereby\npresenting the flexibility to adapt the inference cost at a prescribed budget.\nWe demonstrate through experiments that B2NNs obtained from our MixBin strategy\nare significantly better than those obtained from random selection of the\nnetwork layers. To perform partial binarization in an effective manner, it is\nimportant that both the full-precision as well as the binary components of the\nB2NN are appropriately optimized. We also demonstrate that the choice of the\nactivation function can have a significant effect on this process, and to\ncircumvent this issue, we present BinReLU, that can be used as an effective\nactivation function for the full-precision as well as the binary components of\nany B2NN. Experimental investigations reveal that BinReLU outperforms the other\nactivation functions in all possible scenarios of B2NN: zero-, partial- as well\nas full binarization.

    "title": "Deep Unsupervised Key Frame Extraction for Efficient Video  Classification",
    "abstract": "Video processing and analysis have become an urgent task since a huge amount\nof videos (e.g., Youtube, Hulu) are uploaded online every day. The extraction\nof representative key frames from videos is very important in video processing\nand analysis since it greatly reduces computing resources and time. Although\ngreat progress has been made recently, large-scale video classification remains\nan open problem, as the existing methods have not well balanced the performance\nand efficiency simultaneously. To tackle this problem, this work presents an\nunsupervised method to retrieve the key frames, which combines Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN) and Temporal Segment Density Peaks Clustering (TSDPC). The\nproposed TSDPC is a generic and powerful framework and it has two advantages\ncompared with previous works, one is that it can calculate the number of key\nframes automatically. The other is that it can preserve the temporal\ninformation of the video. Thus it improves the efficiency of video\nclassification. Furthermore, a Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) is added\non the top of the CNN to further elevate the performance of classification.\nMoreover, a weight fusion strategy of different input networks is presented to\nboost the performance. By optimizing both video classification and key frame\nextraction simultaneously, we achieve better classification performance and\nhigher efficiency. We evaluate our method on two popular datasets (i.e., HMDB51\nand UCF101) and the experimental results consistently demonstrate that our\nstrategy achieves competitive performance and efficiency compared with the\nstate-of-the-art approaches.",

Consequently, one\noften faces the challenging task of predicting desirable properties from small\ndata sets or scarcely-labeled data sets. Although transfer learning can be\nadvantageous, it requires the existence of a related large data set. This work\nintroduces three graph-based models incorporating Merriman-Bence-Osher (MBO)\ntechniques to tackle this challenge. Specifically, graph-based modifications of\nthe MBO scheme is integrated with state-of-the-art techniques, including a\nhome-made transformer and an autoencoder, in order to deal with\nscarcely-labeled data sets. In addition, a consensus technique is detailed. The\nproposed models are validated using five benchmark data sets. We also provide a\nthorough comparison to other competing methods, such as support vector\nmachines, random forests, and gradient boosted decision trees, which are known\nfor their good performance on small data sets. The performances of various\nmethods are analyzed using residue-similarity (R-S) scores and R-S indices.\nExtensive computational experiments and theoretical analysis show that the new\nmodels perform very well even when as little as 1% of the data set is used as\nlabeled data.",

However, OMAVs often incorporate additional\nactuators and complex mechanical structures to achieve omnidirectionality.\nObtaining precise mathematical models is difficult, and the mismatch between\nthe model and the real physical system is not trivial.

    "abstract": "A successful machine learning (ML) algorithm often relies on a large amount\nof high-quality data to train well-performed models. Supervised learning\napproaches, such as deep learning techniques, generate high-quality ML\nfunctions for real-life applications, however with large costs and human\nefforts to label training data. Recent advancements in federated learning (FL)\nallow multiple data owners or organisations to collaboratively train a machine\nlearning model without sharing raw data. In this light, vertical FL allows\norganisations to build a global model when the participating organisations have\nvertically partitioned data. Further, in the vertical FL setting the\nparticipating organisation generally requires fewer resources compared to\nsharing data directly, enabling lightweight and scalable distributed training\nsolutions. However, privacy protection in vertical FL is challenging due to the\ncommunication of intermediate outputs and the gradients of model update. This\ninvites adversary entities to infer other organisations underlying data. Thus,\nin this paper, we aim to explore how to protect the privacy of individual\norganisation data in a differential privacy (DP) setting. We run experiments\nwith different real-world datasets and DP budgets. Our experimental results\nshow that a trade-off point needs to be found to achieve a balance between the\nvertical FL performance and privacy protection in terms of the amount of\nperturbation noise.",

Therefore, constructing efficient\nreduced order models (ROMs) that enable accurate but fast predictions, while\nretaining the dynamical characteristics of the physical phenomenon as\nparameters vary, is of paramount importance. In this work, a data-driven,\nnon-intrusive framework which combines ROM construction with reduced dynamics\nidentification, is presented. Starting from a limited amount of full order\nsolutions, the proposed approach leverages autoencoder neural networks with\nparametric sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) to construct a\nlow-dimensional dynamical model which can be queried to efficiently compute\nfull-time solutions at new parameter instances, as well as directly fed to\ncontinuation algorithms. These latter aim at tracking the evolution of periodic\nsteady-state responses as functions of system parameters, avoiding the\ncomputation of the transient phase, and allowing to detect instabilities and\nbifurcations. Featuring an explicit and parametrized modeling of the reduced\ndynamics, the proposed data-driven framework presents remarkable capabilities\nto generalize both with respect to time and parameters.

Like human vision system (HVS), machine vision system (MVS) is\nsensitive to image quality, as quality degradation leads to information loss\nand recognition failure. In recent years, MVS-targeted image processing,\nparticularly image and video compression, has emerged. However, existing\nmethods only target an individual machine rather than the general machine\ncommunity, thus cannot satisfy every type of machine. Moreover, the MVS\ncharacteristics are not well leveraged, which limits compression efficiency. In\nthis paper, we introduce a new concept, Satisfied Machine Ratio (SMR), to\naddress these issues. SMR statistically measures the image quality from the\nmachine's perspective by collecting and combining satisfaction scores from a\nlarge quantity and variety of machine subjects, where such scores are obtained\nwith MVS characteristics considered properly. We create the first large-scale\nSMR dataset that contains over 22 million annotated images for SMR studies.\nFurthermore, a deep learning-based model is proposed to predict the SMR for any\ngiven compressed image or video frame.

In particular, due to the desirable axiomatic\nproperties, several Shapley value approximation methods have been proposed. In\nthese methods, the value function is typically defined as the predictive\naccuracy over the entire development set. However, this limits the ability to\ndifferentiate between training instances that are helpful or harmful to their\nown classes. Intuitively, instances that harm their own classes may be noisy or\nmislabeled and should receive a lower valuation than helpful instances. In this\nwork, we propose CS-Shapley, a Shapley value with a new value function that\ndiscriminates between training instances' in-class and out-of-class\ncontributions. Our theoretical analysis shows the proposed value function is\n(essentially) the unique function that satisfies two desirable properties for\nevaluating data values in classification. Further, our experiments on two\nbenchmark evaluation tasks (data removal and noisy label detection) and four\nclassifiers demonstrate the effectiveness of CS-Shapley over existing methods.\nLastly, we evaluate the \"transferability\" of data values estimated from one\nclassifier to others, and our results suggest Shapley-based data valuation is\ntransferable for application across different models.",

Quantizing a model without access to the original data, zero-shot\nquantization can be accomplished by fitting the real data distribution by data\nsynthesis. However, zero-shot quantization achieves inferior performance\ncompared to the post-training quantization with real data. We find it is\nbecause: 1) a normal generator is hard to obtain high diversity of synthetic\ndata, since it lacks long-range information to allocate attention to global\nfeatures; 2) the synthetic images aim to simulate the statistics of real data,\nwhich leads to weak intra-class heterogeneity and limited feature richness. To\novercome these problems, we propose a novel deep network quantizer, dubbed\nLong-Range Zero-Shot Generative Deep Network Quantization (LRQ). Technically,\nwe propose a long-range generator to learn long-range information instead of\nsimple local features.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised point cloud completion aims to infer the whole geometry of a\npartial object observation without requiring partial-complete correspondence.\nDiffering from existing deterministic approaches, we advocate generative\nmodeling based unsupervised point cloud completion to explore the missing\ncorrespondence. Specifically, we propose a novel framework that performs\ncompletion by transforming a partial shape encoding into a complete one using a\nlatent transport module, and it is designed as a latent-space energy-based\nmodel (EBM) in an encoder-decoder architecture, aiming to learn a probability\ndistribution conditioned on the partial shape encoding. To train the latent\ncode transport module and the encoder-decoder network jointly, we introduce a\nresidual sampling strategy, where the residual captures the domain gap between\npartial and complete shape latent spaces. As a generative model-based\nframework, our method can produce uncertainty maps consistent with human\nperception, leading to explainable unsupervised point cloud completion. We\nexperimentally show that the proposed method produces high-fidelity completion\nresults, outperforming state-of-the-art models by a significant margin.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the few-shot image classification problem. One notable\nlimitation of few-shot learning is the variation in describing the same\ncategory, which might result in a significant difference between small labeled\nsupport and large unlabeled query sets. Our approach is to obtain a relation\nheatmap between the two sets in order to label the latter one in a transductive\nsetting manner. This can be solved by using cross-attention with the scaled\ndot-product mechanism. However, the magnitude differences between two separate\nsets of embedding vectors may cause a significant impact on the output\nattention map and affect model performance. We tackle this problem by improving\nthe attention mechanism with cosine similarity. Specifically, we develop FS-CT\n(Few-shot Cosine Transformer), a few-shot image classification method based on\nprototypical embedding and transformer-based framework. The proposed Cosine\nattention improves FS-CT performances significantly from nearly 5% to over 20%\nin accuracy compared to the baseline scaled dot-product attention in various\nscenarios on three few-shot datasets mini-ImageNet, CUB-200, and CIFAR-FS.\nAdditionally, we enhance the prototypical embedding for categorical\nrepresentation with learnable weights before feeding them to the attention\nmodule. Our proposed method FS-CT along with the Cosine attention is simple to\nimplement and can be applied for a wide range of applications.

Accessing the Metaverse via\nautonomous vehicles (AVs), drivers and passengers can immerse in and interact\nwith 3D virtual objects overlaying views of streets on head-up displays (HUD)\nvia augmented reality (AR).

In this paper, we study\nout-of-dynamics imitation learning (OOD-IL), which relaxes the assumption to\nthat the demonstrator and the imitator have the same state spaces but could\nhave different action spaces and dynamics. OOD-IL enables imitation learning to\nutilize demonstrations from a wide range of demonstrators but introduces a new\nchallenge: some demonstrations cannot be achieved by the imitator due to the\ndifferent dynamics. Prior works try to filter out such demonstrations by\nfeasibility measurements, but ignore the fact that the demonstrations exhibit a\nmultimodal distribution since the different demonstrators may take different\npolicies in different dynamics. We develop a better transferability measurement\nto tackle this newly-emerged challenge. We firstly design a novel\nsequence-based contrastive clustering algorithm to cluster demonstrations from\nthe same mode to avoid the mutual interference of demonstrations from different\nmodes, and then learn the transferability of each demonstration with an\nadversarial-learning based algorithm in each cluster. Experiment results on\nseveral MuJoCo environments, a driving environment, and a simulated robot\nenvironment show that the proposed transferability measurement more accurately\nfinds and down-weights non-transferable demonstrations and outperforms prior\nworks on the final imitation learning performance.

Despite\nextensively reducing the number of tunable parameters and achieving satisfying\nperformance, PT is training-inefficient due to its slow convergence. To improve\nPT's training efficiency, we first make some novel observations about the\nprompt transferability of \"partial PLMs\", which are defined by compressing a\nPLM in depth or width. We observe that the soft prompts learned by different\npartial PLMs of various sizes are similar in the parameter space, implying that\nthese soft prompts could potentially be transferred among partial PLMs.\nInspired by these observations, we propose Fast Prompt Tuning (FPT), which\nstarts by conducting PT using a small-scale partial PLM, and then progressively\nexpands its depth and width until the full-model size. After each expansion, we\nrecycle the previously learned soft prompts as initialization for the enlarged\npartial PLM and then proceed PT. We demonstrate the feasibility of FPT on 5\ntasks and show that FPT could save over 30% training computations while\nachieving comparable performance.",

Considering that masking is a kind of corruption, in this\nwork we explore a more general denoising autoencoder for point cloud learning\n(Point-DAE) by investigating more types of corruptions beyond masking.\nSpecifically, we degrade the point cloud with certain corruptions as input, and\nlearn an encoder-decoder model to reconstruct the original point cloud from its\ncorrupted version. Three corruption families (i.e., density/masking, noise, and\naffine transformation) and a total of fourteen corruption types are\ninvestigated. Interestingly, the affine transformation-based Point-DAE\ngenerally outperforms others (e.g., the popular masking corruptions),\nsuggesting a promising direction for self-supervised point cloud learning. More\nimportantly, we find a statistically significant linear relationship between\ntask relatedness and model performance on downstream tasks. This finding partly\ndemystifies the advantage of affine transformation-based Point-DAE, given that\nsuch Point-DAE variants are closely related to the downstream classification\ntask.

Specifically, by treating feature elements as neuron\nactivation states, we show that conventional alignment methods tend to\ndeteriorate the diversity of learned invariant features, as they\nindiscriminately minimize all neuron activation differences. This instead\nignores rich relations among neurons -- many of them often identify the same\nvisual concepts though they emerge differently.

    "abstract": "Keyphrase generation aims to automatically generate short phrases summarizing\nan input document. The recently emerged ONE2SET paradigm (Ye et al., 2021)\ngenerates keyphrases as a set and has achieved competitive performance.\nNevertheless, we observe serious calibration errors outputted by ONE2SET,\nespecially in the over-estimation of $\\varnothing$ token (means \"no\ncorresponding keyphrase\"). In this paper, we deeply analyze this limitation and\nidentify two main reasons behind: 1) the parallel generation has to introduce\nexcessive $\\varnothing$ as padding tokens into training instances; and 2) the\ntraining mechanism assigning target to each slot is unstable and further\naggravates the $\\varnothing$ token over-estimation. To make the model\nwell-calibrated, we propose WR-ONE2SET which extends ONE2SET with an adaptive\ninstance-level cost Weighting strategy and a target Re-assignment mechanism.\nThe former dynamically penalizes the over-estimated slots for different\ninstances thus smoothing the uneven training distribution. The latter refines\nthe original inappropriate assignment and reduces the supervisory signals of\nover-estimated slots. Experimental results on commonly-used datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our proposed paradigm.",

    "abstract": "Incremental or continual learning has been extensively studied for image\nclassification tasks to alleviate catastrophic forgetting, a phenomenon that\nearlier learned knowledge is forgotten when learning new concepts. For class\nincremental semantic segmentation, such a phenomenon often becomes much worse\ndue to the background shift, i.e., some concepts learned at previous stages are\nassigned to the background class at the current training stage, therefore,\nsignificantly reducing the performance of these old concepts. To address this\nissue, we propose a simple yet effective method in this paper, named Mining\nunseen Classes via Regional Objectness for Segmentation (MicroSeg). Our\nMicroSeg is based on the assumption that background regions with strong\nobjectness possibly belong to those concepts in the historical or future\nstages. Therefore, to avoid forgetting old knowledge at the current training\nstage, our MicroSeg first splits the given image into hundreds of segment\nproposals with a proposal generator. Those segment proposals with strong\nobjectness from the background are then clustered and assigned newly-defined\nlabels during the optimization. In this way, the distribution characterizes of\nold concepts in the feature space could be better perceived, relieving the\ncatastrophic forgetting caused by the background shift accordingly. Extensive\nexperiments on Pascal VOC and ADE20K datasets show competitive results with\nstate-of-the-art, well validating the effectiveness of the proposed MicroSeg.",

    "abstract": "Student engagement is an important factor in meeting the goals of virtual\nlearning programs. Automatic measurement of student engagement provides helpful\ninformation for instructors to meet learning program objectives and\nindividualize program delivery. Many existing approaches solve video-based\nengagement measurement using the traditional frameworks of binary\nclassification (classifying video snippets into engaged or disengaged classes),\nmulti-class classification (classifying video snippets into multiple classes\ncorresponding to different levels of engagement), or regression (estimating a\ncontinuous value corresponding to the level of engagement). However, we observe\nthat while the engagement behaviour is mostly well-defined (e.g., focused, not\ndistracted), disengagement can be expressed in various ways. In addition, in\nsome cases, the data for disengaged classes may not be sufficient to train\ngeneralizable binary or multi-class classifiers. To handle this situation, in\nthis paper, for the first time, we formulate detecting disengagement in virtual\nlearning as an anomaly detection problem. We design various autoencoders,\nincluding temporal convolutional network autoencoder, long-short-term memory\nautoencoder, and feedforward autoencoder using different behavioral and affect\nfeatures for video-based student disengagement detection. The result of our\nexperiments on two publicly available student engagement datasets, DAiSEE and\nEmotiW, shows the superiority of the proposed approach for disengagement\ndetection as an anomaly compared to binary classifiers for classifying videos\ninto engaged versus disengaged classes (with an average improvement of 9% on\nthe area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve and 22%\non the area under the curve of the precision-recall curve).",

    "abstract": "Medical image benchmarks for the segmentation of organs and tumors suffer\nfrom the partially labeling issue due to its intensive cost of labor and\nexpertise. Current mainstream approaches follow the practice of one network\nsolving one task. With this pipeline, not only the performance is limited by\nthe typically small dataset of a single task, but also the computation cost\nlinearly increases with the number of tasks. To address this, we propose a\nTransformer based dynamic on-demand network (TransDoDNet) that learns to\nsegment organs and tumors on multiple partially labeled datasets. Specifically,\nTransDoDNet has a hybrid backbone that is composed of the convolutional neural\nnetwork and Transformer. A dynamic head enables the network to accomplish\nmultiple segmentation tasks flexibly. Unlike existing approaches that fix\nkernels after training, the kernels in the dynamic head are generated\nadaptively by the Transformer, which employs the self-attention mechanism to\nmodel long-range organ-wise dependencies and decodes the organ embedding that\ncan represent each organ. We create a large-scale partially labeled Multi-Organ\nand Tumor Segmentation benchmark, termed MOTS, and demonstrate the superior\nperformance of our TransDoDNet over other competitors on seven organ and tumor\nsegmentation tasks. This study also provides a general 3D medical image\nsegmentation model, which has been pre-trained on the large-scale MOTS\nbenchmark and has demonstrated advanced performance over BYOL, the current\npredominant self-supervised learning method.

    "abstract": "Influenced by the advances in data and computing, the scientific practice\nincreasingly involves machine learning and artificial intelligence driven\nmethods which requires specialized capabilities at the system-, science- and\nservice-level in addition to the conventional large-capacity supercomputing\napproaches. The latest distributed architectures built around the composability\nof data-centric applications led to the emergence of a new ecosystem for\ncontainer coordination and integration. However, there is still a divide\nbetween the application development pipelines of existing supercomputing\nenvironments, and these new dynamic environments that disaggregate fluid\nresource pools through accessible, portable and re-programmable interfaces. New\napproaches for dynamic composability of heterogeneous systems are needed to\nfurther advance the data-driven scientific practice for the purpose of more\nefficient computing and usable tools for specific scientific domains. In this\npaper, we present a novel approach for using composable systems in the\nintersection between scientific computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and\nremote sensing domain. We describe the architecture of a first working example\nof a composable infrastructure that federates Expanse, an NSF-funded\nsupercomputer, with Nautilus, a Kubernetes-based GPU geo-distributed cluster.\nWe also summarize a case study in wildfire modeling, that demonstrates the\napplication of this new infrastructure in scientific workflows: a composed\nsystem that bridges the insights from edge sensing, AI and computing\ncapabilities with a physics-driven simulation.",

    "abstract": "Causal structure learning has been extensively studied and widely used in\nmachine learning and various applications. To achieve an ideal performance,\nexisting causal structure learning algorithms often need to centralize a large\namount of data from multiple data sources. However, in the privacy-preserving\nsetting, it is impossible to centralize data from all sources and put them\ntogether as a single dataset. To preserve data privacy, federated learning as a\nnew learning paradigm has attached much attention in machine learning in recent\nyears. In this paper, we study a privacy-aware causal structure learning\nproblem in the federated setting and propose a novel Federated PC (FedPC)\nalgorithm with two new strategies for preserving data privacy without\ncentralizing data. Specifically, we first propose a novel layer-wise\naggregation strategy for a seamless adaptation of the PC algorithm into the\nfederated learning paradigm for federated skeleton learning, then we design an\neffective strategy for learning consistent separation sets for federated edge\norientation. The extensive experiments validate that FedPC is effective for\ncausal structure learning in federated learning setting.",

Spanners and distance preservers, on the other hand, ask for\nremoving many edges from the graph while approximately preserving shortest path\ndistances.\nWe provide a general reduction scheme from graph hopsets to the known metric\ncompression schemes of spanners, emulators and distance preservers.\nConsequently, we get new and improved upper bound constructions for the latter,\nas well as, new lower bound results for hopsets.

    "abstract": "Multimodal recommender systems utilizing multimodal features (e.g. images and\ntextual descriptions) typically show better recommendation accuracy than\ngeneral recommendation models based solely on user-item interactions.\nGenerally, prior work fuses multimodal features into item ID embeddings to\nenrich item representations, thus failing to capture the latent semantic\nitem-item structures. In this context, LATTICE [1] proposes to learn the latent\nstructure between items explicitly and achieves state-of-the-art performance\nfor multimodal recommendations. However, we argue the latent graph structure\nlearning of LATTICE is both inefficient and unnecessary. Experimentally, we\ndemonstrate that freezing its item-item structure before training can also\nachieve competitive performance. Based on this finding, we propose a simple yet\neffective model, dubbed as FREEDOM, that FREEzes the item-item graph and\nDenOises the user-item interaction graph simultaneously for Multimodal\nrecommendation. In denoising the user-item interaction graph, we devise a\ndegree-sensitive edge pruning method, which rejects possibly noisy edges with a\nhigh probability when sampling the graph. We evaluate the proposed model on\nthree real-world datasets and show that FREEDOM can significantly outperform\nthe strongest baselines. Compared with LATTICE, FREEDOM achieves an average\nimprovement of 19.07\\% in recommendation accuracy while reducing its memory\ncost up to 6$\\times$ on large graphs.

    "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most common\nchronic illnesses in the world and the third leading cause of mortality\nworldwide. It is often underdiagnosed or not diagnosed until later in the\ndisease course. Spirometry tests are the gold standard for diagnosing COPD but\ncan be difficult to obtain, especially in resource-poor countries. Chest X-rays\n(CXRs), however, are readily available and may serve as a screening tool to\nidentify patients with COPD who should undergo further testing. Currently, no\nresearch applies deep learning (DL) algorithms that use large multi-site and\nmulti-modal data to detect COPD patients and evaluate fairness across\ndemographic groups. We use three CXR datasets in our study, CheXpert to\npre-train models, MIMIC-CXR to develop, and Emory-CXR to validate our models.\nThe CXRs from patients in the early stage of COPD and not on mechanical\nventilation are selected for model training and validation. We visualize the\nGrad-CAM heatmaps of the true positive cases on the base model for both\nMIMIC-CXR and Emory-CXR test datasets. We further propose two fusion schemes,\n(1) model-level fusion, including bagging and stacking methods using MIMIC-CXR,\nand (2) data-level fusion, including multi-site data using MIMIC-CXR and\nEmory-CXR, and multi-modal using MIMIC-CXRs and MIMIC-IV EHR, to improve the\noverall model performance. Fairness analysis is performed to evaluate if the\nfusion schemes have a discrepancy in the performance among different\ndemographic groups. The results demonstrate that DL models can detect COPD\nusing CXRs, which can facilitate early screening, especially in low-resource\nregions where CXRs are more accessible than spirometry. The multi-site data\nfusion scheme could improve the model generalizability on the Emory-CXR test\ndata. Further studies on using CXR or other modalities to predict COPD ought to\nbe in future work.",

However, physical environments are often\nimperfect and policies that perform well in simulation might not achieve the\nsame performance when applied elsewhere. A common approach to combat this is to\ntrain agents in the presence of an adversary. An adversary acts to destabilise\nthe agent, which learns a more robust policy and can better handle realistic\nconditions. Many real-world applications of reinforcement learning also make\nuse of goal-conditioning: this is particularly useful in the context of\nrobotics, as it allows the agent to act differently, depending on which goal is\nselected. Here, we focus on the problem of goal-conditioned learning in the\npresence of an adversary. We first present DigitFlip and CLEVR-Play, two novel\ngoal-conditioned environments that support acting against an adversary. Next,\nwe propose EHER and CHER -- two HER-based algorithms for goal-conditioned\nlearning -- and evaluate their performance. Finally, we unify the two threads\nand introduce IGOAL: a novel framework for goal-conditioned learning in the\npresence of an adversary. Experimental results show that combining IGOAL with\nEHER allows agents to significantly outperform existing approaches, when acting\nagainst both random and competent adversaries.",

The extended optimization leads to a significantly different solution\nfor the compression operation at the variable node. Simulation results for\nregular LDPC codes confirm that the check node aware design, especially for\nvery coarse quantization with 2- or 3-bit messages, achieves performance gains\nof up to 0.2 dB - without additional hardware costs. We also show that the\n2-bit message resolution enables a very efficient implementation of the check\nnode update, which requires only 2/9 of the 3-bit check node's transistor count\nand reduces the signal propagation delay by a factor of 4.",

    "title": "Ground Truth Inference for Weakly Supervised Entity Matching",
    "abstract": "Entity matching (EM) refers to the problem of identifying pairs of data\nrecords in one or more relational tables that refer to the same entity in the\nreal world. Supervised machine learning (ML) models currently achieve\nstate-of-the-art matching performance; however, they require many labeled\nexamples, which are often expensive or infeasible to obtain. This has inspired\nus to approach data labeling for EM using weak supervision. In particular, we\nuse the labeling function abstraction popularized by Snorkel, where each\nlabeling function (LF) is a user-provided program that can generate many noisy\nmatch/non-match labels quickly and cheaply. Given a set of user-written LFs,\nthe quality of data labeling depends on a labeling model to accurately infer\nthe ground-truth labels. In this work, we first propose a simple but powerful\nlabeling model for general weak supervision tasks. Then, we tailor the labeling\nmodel specifically to the task of entity matching by considering the\nEM-specific transitivity property.\nThe general form of our labeling model is simple while substantially\noutperforming the best existing method across ten general weak supervision\ndatasets. To tailor the labeling model for EM, we formulate an approach to\nensure that the final predictions of the labeling model satisfy the\ntransitivity property required in EM, utilizing an exact solution where\npossible and an ML-based approximation in remaining cases. On two single-table\nand nine two-table real-world EM datasets, we show that our labeling model\nresults in a 9% higher F1 score on average than the best existing method. We\nalso show that a deep learning EM end model (DeepMatcher) trained on labels\ngenerated from our weak supervision approach is comparable to an end model\ntrained using tens of thousands of ground-truth labels, demonstrating that our\napproach can significantly reduce the labeling efforts required in EM.",

    "abstract": "Real-time fraud detection is a challenge for most financial and electronic\ncommercial platforms. To identify fraudulent communities, Grab, one of the\nlargest technology companies in Southeast Asia, forms a graph from a set of\ntransactions and detects dense subgraphs arising from abnormally large numbers\nof connections among fraudsters. Existing dense subgraph detection approaches\nfocus on static graphs without considering the fact that transaction graphs are\nhighly dynamic. Moreover, detecting dense subgraphs from scratch with graph\nupdates is time consuming and cannot meet the real-time requirement in\nindustry. To address this problem, we introduce an incremental real-time fraud\ndetection framework called Spade. Spade can detect fraudulent communities in\nhundreds of microseconds on million-scale graphs by incrementally maintaining\ndense subgraphs. Furthermore, Spade supports batch updates and edge grouping to\nreduce response latency. Lastly, Spade provides simple but expressive APIs for\nthe design of evolving fraud detection semantics. Developers plug their\ncustomized suspiciousness functions into Spade which incrementalizes their\nsemantics without recasting their algorithms. Extensive experiments show that\nSpade detects fraudulent communities in real time on million-scale graphs.\nPeeling algorithms incrementalized by Spade are up to a million times faster\nthan the static version.",

    "abstract": "Although prior art has demonstrated negligible accuracy drop in sub-byte\nquantization -- where weights and/or activations are represented by less than 8\nbits -- popular SIMD instructions of CPUs do not natively support these\ndatatypes. While recent methods, such as ULPPACK, are already using sub-byte\nquantization on general-purpose CPUs with vector units, they leave out several\nempty bits between the sub-byte values in memory and in vector registers to\navoid overflow to the neighbours during the operations. This results in memory\nfootprint and bandwidth-usage inefficiencies and suboptimal performance. In\nthis paper, we present memory layouts for storing, and mechanisms for\nprocessing sub-byte (4-, 2-, or 1-bit) models that utilize all the bits in the\nmemory as well as in the vector registers for the actual data. We provide\ncompute kernels for the proposed layout for the GEMV (GEneral Matrix-Vector\nmultiplication) operations between weights and activations of different\ndatatypes (e.g., 8-bit activations and 4-bit weights). For evaluation, we\nextended the TFLite package and added our methods to it, then ran the models on\nthe cycle-accurate gem5 simulator to compare detailed memory and CPU cycles of\neach method. We compare against nine other methods that are actively used in\nproduction including GEMLOWP, Ruy, XNNPack, and ULPPACK. Furthermore, we\nexplore the effect of different input and output sizes of deep learning layers\non the performance of our proposed method. Experimental results show 0.96-2.1x\nspeedup for small sizes and 1.2-6.7x speedup for mid to large sizes. Applying\nour proposal to a real-world speech recognition model, Mozilla DeepSpeech, we\nproved that our method achieves 1.56-2.11x end-to-end speedup compared to the\nstate-of-the-art, depending on the bit-width employed.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks, such as the Deep-FSMN, have been widely studied for\nkeyword spotting (KWS) applications while suffering expensive computation and\nstorage. Therefore, network compression technologies like binarization are\nstudied to deploy KWS models on edge. In this paper, we present a strong yet\nefficient binary neural network for KWS, namely BiFSMNv2, pushing it to the\nreal-network accuracy performance. First, we present a Dual-scale Thinnable\n1-bit-Architecture to recover the representation capability of the binarized\ncomputation units by dual-scale activation binarization and liberate the\nspeedup potential from an overall architecture perspective. Second, we also\nconstruct a Frequency Independent Distillation scheme for KWS\nbinarization-aware training, which distills the high and low-frequency\ncomponents independently to mitigate the information mismatch between\nfull-precision and binarized representations. Moreover, we implement BiFSMNv2\non ARMv8 real-world hardware with a novel Fast Bitwise Computation Kernel,\nwhich is proposed to fully utilize registers and increase instruction\nthroughput. Comprehensive experiments show our BiFSMNv2 outperforms existing\nbinary networks for KWS by convincing margins across different datasets and\neven achieves comparable accuracy with the full-precision networks (e.g., only\n1.59% drop on Speech Commands V1-12). We highlight that benefiting from the\ncompact architecture and optimized hardware kernel, BiFSMNv2 can achieve an\nimpressive 25.1x speedup and 20.2x storage-saving on edge hardware.",

Gesture segmentation using pose estimations achieved comparable\nresults to physical sensors while being remote and markerless. Surgical skill\nproxies that rely on pose estimation proved they can be used to work towards\nautomated training feedback. We hope our findings encourage additional\ncollaboration on novel skill proxies to make surgical training more efficient.",

    "abstract": "Recently it has been shown that without any access to the contextual passage,\nmultiple choice reading comprehension (MCRC) systems are able to answer\nquestions significantly better than random on average. These systems use their\naccumulated \"world knowledge\" to directly answer questions, rather than using\ninformation from the passage. This paper examines the possibility of exploiting\nthis observation as a tool for test designers to ensure that the use of \"world\nknowledge\" is acceptable for a particular set of questions. We propose\ninformation-theory based metrics that enable the level of \"world knowledge\"\nexploited by systems to be assessed. Two metrics are described: the expected\nnumber of options, which measures whether a passage-free system can identify\nthe answer a question using world knowledge; and the contextual mutual\ninformation, which measures the importance of context for a given question. We\ndemonstrate that questions with low expected number of options, and hence\nanswerable by the shortcut system, are often similarly answerable by humans\nwithout context. This highlights that the general knowledge 'shortcuts' could\nbe equally used by exam candidates, and that our proposed metrics may be\nhelpful for future test designers to monitor the quality of questions.",

For undirected graphs, we prove\nthat the same theorem holds (up to a difference in the constant 3). For\ndirected graphs, we provide a counterexample to the theorem (for any constant),\nand prove a roundtrip analogue of the theorem which shows there exists a pair\n$(s,t)$ of nodes such that every node in $G$ is contained in the union of a\nshortest $st$-path and a shortest $ts$-path.\nThe original theorem for DAGs has an application to the $k$-Shortest Paths\nwith Congestion $c$ (($k,c$)-SPC) problem. In this problem, we are given a\nweighted graph $G$, together with $k$ node pairs $(s_1,t_1),\\dots,(s_k,t_k)$,\nand a positive integer $c\\leq k$. We are tasked with finding paths $P_1,\\dots,\nP_k$ such that each $P_i$ is a shortest path from $s_i$ to $t_i$, and every\nnode in the graph is on at most $c$ paths $P_i$, or reporting that no such\ncollection of paths exists.\nWhen $c=k$ the problem is easily solved by finding shortest paths for each\npair $(s_i,t_i)$ independently. When $c=1$, the $(k,c)$-SPC problem recovers\nthe $k$-Disjoint Shortest Paths ($k$-DSP) problem, where the collection of\nshortest paths must be node-disjoint. For fixed $k$, $k$-DSP can be solved in\npolynomial time on DAGs and undirected graphs. Previous work shows that the\nlocal-to-global theorem for DAGs implies that $(k,c)$-SPC on DAGs whenever\n$k-c$ is constant. In the same way, our work implies that $(k,c)$-SPC can be\nsolved in polynomial time on undirected graphs whenever $k-c$ is constant.",

For the same stretch, and assuming the query time is $n^{o(1)}$ Abboud et\nal. proved an $\\Omega(m^{1+\\frac{1}{12.7552 \\cdot k}})$ lower bound on the\npreprocessing time; we improve it to $\\Omega(m^{1+\\frac1{2k}})$ which is only a\nfactor 2 away from the upper bound. We also obtain tight bounds for stretch\n$2+o(1)$ and $3-\\epsilon$ and higher lower bounds for dynamic shortest paths.\n* Listing 4-cycles: Abboud et al. proved the first super-linear lower bound\nfor listing all 4-cycles in a graph, ruling out $(m^{1.1927}+t)^{1+o(1)}$ time\nalgorithms where $t$ is the number of 4-cycles. We settle the complexity of\nthis basic problem by showing that the $\\widetilde{O}(\\min(m^{4/3},n^2) +t)$\nupper bound is tight up to $n^{o(1)}$ factors.\nOur results exploit a rich tool set from additive combinatorics, most notably\nthe Balog-Szemer\\'edi-Gowers theorem and Rusza's covering lemma. A key\ningredient that may be of independent interest is a subquadratic algorithm for\n3-SUM if one of the sets has small doubling.",

Although deep neural networks\nhave the capability of learning powerful multi-level representations, they can\nnot explicitly model part-whole hierarchies, which limits their expressiveness\nand interpretability in processing 3D vision data such as point clouds. To this\nend, we propose an encoder-decoder style latent variable model that explicitly\nlearns the part-whole hierarchies for the multi-level point cloud segmentation.\nSpecifically, the encoder takes a point cloud as input and predicts the\nper-point latent subpart distribution at the middle level. The decoder takes\nthe latent variable and the feature from the encoder as an input and predicts\nthe per-point part distribution at the top level. During training, only\nannotated part labels at the top level are provided, thus making the whole\nframework weakly supervised. We explore two kinds of approximated inference\nalgorithms, i.e., most-probable-latent and Monte Carlo methods, and three\nstochastic gradient estimations for learning discrete latent variables, i.e.,\nstraight-through, REINFORCE, and pathwise estimators.

Semi-supervised learning can be used to alleviate this issue.\nPrevious semi-supervised 3D object detection methods directly follow the\npractice of fully-supervised methods to augment labeled and unlabeled data,\nwhich is sub-optimal. In this paper, we design a data augmentation method for\nsemi-supervised learning, which we call Semi-Sampling.

Our semi-sampling can be regarded as an extension of gt-sampling to\nsemi-supervised learning. Our method is simple but effective.

To solve this problem, we propose a web-based question answering\nsystem system with multimodal fusion of unstructured and structured\ninformation, to fill in missing information for knowledge bases.

The adaptive strategy is implemented by applying the limited\ninterpolation only in the parts of the computational domain where the solution\nis identified as ``rough'' with the help of a smoothness indicator.

We implement the proposed LSI using the pressure, which remains\nsmooth at contact discontinuities, while our goal is to detect other ``rough''\nareas and apply the limited interpolation mostly in the neighborhoods of the\nshock waves. We demonstrate that the new adaptive schemes are highly accurate,\nnon-oscillatory, and robust.

    "abstract": "Knowledge graph (KG) enhanced recommendation has demonstrated improved\nperformance in the recommendation system (RecSys) and attracted considerable\nresearch interest. Recently the literature has adopted neural graph networks\n(GNNs) on the collaborative knowledge graph and built an end-to-end KG-enhanced\nRecSys. However, the majority of these approaches have three limitations: (1)\ntreat the collaborative knowledge graph as a homogeneous graph and overlook the\nhighly heterogeneous relationships among items, (2) lack of design to\nexplicitly leverage the rich side information, and (3) overlook the rich\nknowledge in user preference. To fill this gap, in this paper, we explore the\nrich, heterogeneous relationship among items and propose a new KG-enhanced\nrecommendation model called Collaborative Meta-Knowledge Enhanced Recommender\nSystem (MetaKRec). In particular, we focus on modeling the rich, heterogeneous\nsemantic relationships among items and construct several collaborative Meta-KGs\nto explicitly depict the relatedness of the items under the guidance of\nmeta-knowledge. In addition to the knowledge obtained from KG, we leverage user\nknowledge that extracts from user preference to construct the Meta-KGs. The\nconstructed Meta-KGs can capture the knowledge from both the knowledge graph\nand user preference. Furthermore. we utilize a light convolution encoder to\nrecursively integrate the item relationship in each collaborative Meta-KGs.\nThis scheme allows us to explicitly gather the heterogeneous semantic\nrelationships among items and encode them into the representations of items. In\naddition, we propose channel attention to fuse the item and user\nrepresentations from different Meta-KGs. Extensive experiments are conducted on\nfour real-world benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant gains over the\nstate-of-the-art baselines on both regular and cold-start recommendation\nsettings.",

    "abstract": "Heavily relying on 3D annotations limits the real-world application of 3D\nobject detection. In this paper, we propose a method that does not demand any\n3D annotation, while being able to predict full-oriented 3D bounding boxes. Our\nmethod, called Recursive Cross-View (RCV), transforms 3D detection into several\n2D detection tasks, which only consume some 2D labels, based on the three-view\nprinciple. We propose a recursive paradigm, in which instance segmentation and\n3D bounding box generation by Cross-View are implemented recursively until\nconvergence. Specifically, a frustum is proposed via a 2D detector, followed by\nthe recursive paradigm that finally outputs a full-oriented 3D box, class, and\nscore. To justify that our method can be quickly used to new tasks in\nreal-world scenarios, we do three experiments, namely indoor 3D human\ndetection, full-oriented 3D hand detection, and real-time detection on a real\n3D sensor. RCV achieves decent performance in these experiments. Once trained,\nour method can be viewed as a 3D annotation tool. Consequently, we formulate\ntwo 3D labeled dataset, namely '3D_HUMAN' and 'D_HAND', based on RCV, which\ncould be used to pre-train other 3D detectors. Furthermore, estimated on the\nSUN RGB-D benchmark, our method achieves comparable performance with some full\n3D supervised learning methods. RCV is the first 3D detection method that does\nnot consume 3D labels and yields full-oriented 3D boxes on point clouds.",

Different from widely studied instance-level\ncontrastive learning, pixel-wise contrastive learning mainly helps with\npixel-wise tasks such as medical landmark detection. The counterpart to an\ninstance in instance-level CL is a pixel, along with its neighboring context,\nin pixel-wise CL. Aiming to build better feature representation, there is a\nvast literature about designing instance augmentation strategies for\ninstance-level CL; but there is little similar work on pixel augmentation for\npixel-wise CL with a pixel granularity. In this paper, we attempt to bridge\nthis gap. We first classify a pixel into three categories, namely low-,\nmedium-, and high-informative, based on the information quantity the pixel\ncontains. Inspired by the ``InfoMin\" principle, we then design separate\naugmentation strategies for each category in terms of augmentation intensity\nand sampling ratio. Extensive experiments validate that our information-guided\npixel augmentation strategy succeeds in encoding more discriminative\nrepresentations and surpassing other competitive approaches in unsupervised\nlocal feature matching. Furthermore, our pretrained model improves the\nperformance of both one-shot and fully supervised models.

The edge servers serve as\nthe cornerstone of such IoT-based systems, however, their resource limitations\nhamper the continuous execution of multiple (multi-tenant) DL applications. The\nchallenge is that, DL applications function based on bulky \"neural network (NN)\nmodels\" that cannot be simultaneously maintained in the limited memory space of\nthe edge. Accordingly, the main contribution of this research is to overcome\nthe memory contention challenge, thereby, meeting the latency constraints of\nthe DL applications without compromising their inference accuracy. We propose\nan efficient NN model management framework, called Edge-MultiAI, that ushers\nthe NN models of the DL applications into the edge memory such that the degree\nof multi-tenancy and the number of warm-starts are maximized. Edge-MultiAI\nleverages NN model compression techniques, such as model quantization, and\ndynamically loads NN models for DL applications to stimulate multi-tenancy on\nthe edge server. We also devise a model management heuristic for Edge-MultiAI,\ncalled iWS-BFE, that functions based on the Bayesian theory to predict the\ninference requests for multi-tenant applications, and uses it to choose the\nappropriate NN models for loading, hence, increasing the number of warm-start\ninferences. We evaluate the efficacy and robustness of Edge-MultiAI under\nvarious configurations.

It has been widely studied in machine\nlearning literature, and recent advancements in deep learning have revived\ninterest in this field. Contrastive clustering (CC) models are a staple of deep\nclustering in which positive and negative pairs of each data instance are\ngenerated through data augmentation.

    "abstract": "Video surveillance using drones is both convenient and efficient due to the\nease of deployment and unobstructed movement of drones in many scenarios. An\ninteresting application of drone-based video surveillance is to estimate crowd\ndensities (both pedestrians and vehicles) in public places. Deep learning using\nconvolution neural networks (CNNs) is employed for automatic crowd counting and\ndensity estimation using images and videos. However, the performance and\naccuracy of such models typically depend upon the model architecture i.e.,\ndeeper CNN models improve accuracy at the cost of increased inference time. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel crowd density estimation model for drones\n(DroneNet) using Self-organized Operational Neural Networks (Self-ONN).\nSelf-ONN provides efficient learning capabilities with lower computational\ncomplexity as compared to CNN-based models. We tested our algorithm on two\ndrone-view public datasets. Our evaluation shows that the proposed DroneNet\nshows superior performance on an equivalent CNN-based model.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) allows multiple participants to collaboratively build\ndeep learning (DL) models without directly sharing data. Consequently, the\nissue of copyright protection in FL becomes important since unreliable\nparticipants may gain access to the jointly trained model. Application of\nhomomorphic encryption (HE) in secure FL framework prevents the central server\nfrom accessing plaintext models. Thus, it is no longer feasible to embed the\nwatermark at the central server using existing watermarking schemes. In this\npaper, we propose a novel client-side FL watermarking scheme to tackle the\ncopyright protection issue in secure FL with HE. To our best knowledge, it is\nthe first scheme to embed the watermark to models under the Secure FL\nenvironment. We design a black-box watermarking scheme based on client-side\nbackdooring to embed a pre-designed trigger set into an FL model by a\ngradient-enhanced embedding method. Additionally, we propose a trigger set\nconstruction mechanism to ensure the watermark cannot be forged. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our proposed scheme delivers outstanding protection\nperformance and robustness against various watermark removal attacks and\nambiguity attack.",

    "abstract": "Human values such as honesty, social responsibility, fairness, privacy, and\nthe like are things considered important by individuals and society. Software\nsystems, including mobile software applications (apps), may ignore or violate\nsuch values, leading to negative effects in various ways for individuals and\nsociety. While some works have investigated different aspects of human values\nin software engineering, this mixed-methods study focuses on honesty as a\ncritical human value. In particular, we studied (i) how to detect honesty\nviolations in mobile apps, (ii) the types of honesty violations in mobile apps,\nand (iii) the perspectives of app developers on these detected honesty\nviolations. We first develop and evaluate 7 machine learning (ML) models to\nautomatically detect violations of the value of honesty in app reviews from an\nend user perspective. The most promising was a Deep Neural Network model with\nF1 score of 0.921. We then conducted a manual analysis of 401 reviews\ncontaining honesty violations and characterised honest violations in mobile\napps into 10 categories: unfair cancellation and refund policies; false\nadvertisements; delusive subscriptions; cheating systems; inaccurate\ninformation; unfair fees; no service; deletion of reviews; impersonation; and\nfraudulent looking apps. A developer survey and interview study with mobile\ndevelopers then identified 7 key causes behind honesty violations in mobile\napps and 8 strategies to avoid or fix such violations. The findings of our\ndeveloper study also articulate the negative consequences that honesty\nviolations might bring for businesses, developers, and users. Finally, the app\ndevelopers' feedback shows that our prototype ML-based models can have\npromising benefits in practice.",

    "abstract": "Dialogue summarization aims to condense the lengthy dialogue into a concise\nsummary, and has recently achieved significant progress. However, the result of\nexisting methods is still far from satisfactory. Previous works indicated that\nomission is a major factor in affecting the quality of summarization, but few\nof them have further explored the omission problem, such as how omission\naffects summarization results and how to detect omission, which is critical for\nreducing omission and improving summarization quality. Moreover, analyzing and\ndetecting omission relies on summarization datasets with omission labels (i.e.,\nwhich dialogue utterances are omitted in the summarization), which are not\navailable in the current literature. In this paper, we propose the OLDS\ndataset, which provides high-quality Omission Labels for Dialogue\nSummarization. By analyzing this dataset, we find that a large improvement in\nsummarization quality can be achieved by providing ground-truth omission labels\nfor the summarization model to recover omission information, which demonstrates\nthe importance of omission detection for omission mitigation in dialogue\nsummarization. Therefore, we formulate an omission detection task and\ndemonstrate our proposed dataset can support the training and evaluation of\nthis task well. We also call for research action on omission detection based on\nour proposed datasets. Our dataset and codes are publicly available.",

    "abstract": "The vision of pervasive machine learning (ML) services can be realized by\ntraining an ML model on time using real-time data collected by internet of\nthings (IoT) devices. To this end, IoT devices require offloading their data to\nan edge server in proximity. On the other hand, high dimensional data with a\nheavy volume causes a significant burden to an IoT device with a limited energy\nbudget. To cope with the limitation, we propose a novel offloading\narchitecture, called joint data deepening and prefetching (JD2P), which is\nfeature-by-feature offloading comprising two key techniques. The first one is\ndata deepening, where each data sample's features are sequentially offloaded in\nthe order of importance determined by the data embedding technique such as\nprinciple component analysis (PCA). No more features are offloaded when the\nfeatures offloaded so far are enough to classify the data, resulting in\nreducing the amount of offloaded data. The second one is data prefetching,\nwhere some features potentially required in the future are offloaded in\nadvance, thus achieving high efficiency via precise prediction and parameter\noptimization. To verify the effectiveness of JD2P, we conduct experiments using\nthe MNIST and fashion-MNIST dataset.

    "abstract": "Learning-based image dehazing methods are essential to assist autonomous\nsystems in enhancing reliability. Due to the domain gap between synthetic and\nreal domains, the internal information learned from synthesized images is\nusually sub-optimal in real domains, leading to severe performance drop of\ndehaizing models. Driven by the ability on exploring internal information from\na few unseen-domain samples, meta-learning is commonly adopted to address this\nissue via test-time training, which is hyperparameter-sensitive and\ntime-consuming. In contrast, we present a domain generalization framework based\non meta-learning to dig out representative and discriminative internal\nproperties of real hazy domains without test-time training. To obtain\nrepresentative domain-specific information, we attach two entities termed\nadaptation network and distance-aware aggregator to our dehazing network. The\nadaptation network assists in distilling domain-relevant information from a few\nhazy samples and caching it into a collection of features. The distance-aware\naggregator strives to summarize the generated features and filter out\nmisleading information for more representative internal properties. To enhance\nthe discrimination of distilled internal information, we present a novel loss\nfunction called domain-relevant contrastive regularization, which encourages\nthe internal features generated from the same domain more similar and that from\ndiverse domains more distinct. The generated representative and discriminative\nfeatures are regarded as some external variables of our dehazing network to\nregress a particular and powerful function for a given domain. The extensive\nexperiments on real hazy datasets, such as RTTS and URHI, validate that our\nproposed method has superior generalization ability than the state-of-the-art\ncompetitors.",

    "abstract": "Transformers have achieved tremendous success in various computer vision\ntasks. By borrowing design concepts from transformers, many studies\nrevolutionized CNNs and showed remarkable results. This paper falls in this\nline of studies. More specifically, we introduce a convolutional neural network\narchitecture named ParCNetV2, which extends position-aware circular convolution\n(ParCNet) with oversized convolutions and strengthens attention through\nbifurcate gate units. The oversized convolution utilizes a kernel with\n$2\\times$ the input size to model long-range dependencies through a global\nreceptive field. Simultaneously, it achieves implicit positional encoding by\nremoving the shift-invariant property from convolutional kernels, i.e., the\neffective kernels at different spatial locations are different when the kernel\nsize is twice as large as the input size. The bifurcate gate unit implements an\nattention mechanism similar to self-attention in transformers. It splits the\ninput into two branches, one serves as feature transformation while the other\nserves as attention weights. The attention is applied through element-wise\nmultiplication of the two branches. Besides, we introduce a unified\nlocal-global convolution block to unify the design of the early and late stage\nconvolutional blocks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method\noutperforms other pure convolutional neural networks as well as neural networks\nhybridizing CNNs and transformers.",

Specifically, an FL learning\nprocess can be fused with quantized Binomial mechanism-based updates\ncontributed by multiple users to reduce the communication overhead/cost as well\nas to protect the privacy of {participating} users. However, the optimization\nof wireless transmission and quantization parameters (e.g., transmit power,\nbandwidth, and quantization bits) as well as the added noise while guaranteeing\nthe privacy requirement and the performance of the learned FL model remains an\nopen and challenging problem. In this paper, we aim to jointly optimize the\nlevel of quantization, parameters of the Binomial mechanism, and devices'\ntransmit powers to minimize the training time under the constraints of the\nwireless networks. The resulting optimization turns out to be a Mixed Integer\nNon-linear Programming (MINLP) problem, which is known to be NP-hard. To tackle\nit, we transform this MINLP problem into a new problem whose solutions are\nproved to be the optimal solutions of the original one. We then propose an\napproximate algorithm that can solve the transformed problem with an arbitrary\nrelative error guarantee. Intensive simulations show that for the same wireless\nresources the proposed approach achieves the highest accuracy, close to that of\nthe standard FL with no quantization and no noise added.

Finally, numerical results show\nthat the proposed distributed methods greatly outperform conventional cell-free\nmassive MIMO precoding designs that rely solely on local CSI.",

    "abstract": "The SportsMOT competition aims to solve multiple object tracking of athletes\nin different sports scenes such as basketball or soccer. The competition is\nchallenging because of the unstable camera view, athletes' complex trajectory,\nand complicated background. Previous MOT methods can not match enough\nhigh-quality tracks of athletes. To pursue higher performance of MOT in sports\nscenes, we introduce an innovative tracker named SportsTrack, we utilize\ntracking by detection as our detection paradigm. Then we will introduce a\nthree-stage matching process to solve the motion blur and body overlapping in\nsports scenes. Meanwhile, we present another innovation point: one-to-many\ncorrespondence between detection bboxes and crowded tracks to handle the\noverlap of athletes' bodies during sports competitions. Compared to other\ntrackers such as BOT-SORT and ByteTrack, We carefully restored edge-lost tracks\nthat were ignored by other trackers. Finally, we reached the top 1 tracking\nscore (76.264 HOTA) in the ECCV 2022 DeepAction SportsMOT competition.",

    "abstract": "Applications running in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) commonly use\nuntrusted external services such as host File System. Adversaries may\nmaliciously alter the normal service behavior to trigger subtle application\nbugs that would have never occurred under correct service operation, causing\ndata leaks and integrity violations. Unfortunately, existing manual protections\nare incomplete and ad-hoc, whereas formally-verified ones require special\nexpertise.\nWe introduce GateKeeper, a framework to develop mitigations and vulnerability\ncheckers for such attacks by leveraging lightweight formal models of untrusted\nservices. With the attack seen as a violation of a services' functional\ncorrectness, GateKeeper takes a novel approach to develop a comprehensive model\nof a service without requiring formal methods expertise. We harness available\ntesting suites routinely used in service development to tighten the model to\nknown correct service implementation. GateKeeper uses the resulting model to\nautomatically generate (1) a correct-by-construction runtime service validator\nin C that is linked with a trusted application and guards each service\ninvocation to conform to the model; and (2) a targeted model-driven\nvulnerability checker for analyzing black-box applications.\nWe evaluate GateKeeper on Intel SGX enclaves. We develop comprehensive models\nof a POSIX file system and OS synchronization primitives while using thousands\nof existing test suites to tighten their models to the actual Linux\nimplementations. We generate the validator and integrate it with Graphene-SGX,\nand successfully protect unmodified Memcached and SQLite with negligible\noverheads.

The aforementioned limitations leave room for further performance\nimprovement. Against these issues, we propose a novel triple domain\nmodel-driven CTMAR network, termed as TriDoNet, whose network training exploits\ntriple domain knowledge, i.e., the knowledge of the sinogram, CT image, and\nmetal artifact domains. Specifically, to explore the non-local repetitive\nstreaking patterns of metal artifacts, we encode them as an explicit tight\nframe sparse representation model with adaptive thresholds. Furthermore, we\ndesign a contrastive regularization (CR) built upon contrastive learning to\nexploit clean CT images and metal-affected images as positive and negative\nsamples, respectively.

This\nformulation provides an implicit dense 3D reconstruction as it enables the\nimage synthesis of novel shapes from arbitrary view angles and non-rigid\nstructure. The method is built upon a sparse backbone, where a neural regressor\nis first trained to regress parameters describing the cameras and sparse\nnon-rigid structure directly from the latent codes. The latent trajectories\nassociated with changes in the camera and structure parameters are then\nidentified by estimating the local inverse of the regressor in the neighborhood\nof a given latent code.

A general research line\nis reducing computational cost of self attention modules by adopting sparse\nattention or using local attention windows. In contrast, we propose to design\nhigh performance transformer based architectures by densifying the attention\npattern. Specifically, we propose cross attention among blocks of ViT (CabViT),\nwhich uses tokens from previous blocks in the same stage as extra input to the\nmulti-head attention of transformers. The proposed CabViT enhances the\ninteractions of tokens across blocks with potentially different semantics, and\nencourages more information flows to the lower levels, which together improves\nmodel performance and model convergence with limited extra cost. Based on the\nproposed CabViT, we design a series of CabViT models which achieve the best\ntrade-off between model size, computational cost and accuracy. For instance\nwithout the need of knowledge distillation to strength the training, CabViT\nachieves 83.0% top-1 accuracy on Imagenet with only 16.3 million parameters and\nabout 3.9G FLOPs, saving almost half parameters and 13% computational cost\nwhile gaining 0.9% higher accuracy compared with ConvNext, use 52% of\nparameters but gaining 0.6% accuracy compared with distilled EfficientFormer",

Differentially private stochastic gradient\ndescent (DPSGD) is the most popular training method with differential privacy\nin image recognition.

We conduct a user study with\n2109 users in which we find that users depend on context clues -- such as\npresence of advertising and occurrence (and timing of payment) -- to determine\nthe extent to which a mobile app poses a privacy threat. We also quantify how\naccurately user assessments match published data collection practices, and we\nidentify a commonly-held misconception about how payments are processed. This\nwork provides new insight into how users assess the privacy threat posed by\nmobile apps and into social norms around data collection.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning refers to conducting training on multiple distributed\ndevices and collecting model weights from them to derive a shared\nmachine-learning model. This allows the model to get benefit from a rich source\nof data available from multiple sites. Also, since only model weights are\ncollected from distributed devices, the privacy of those data is protected. It\nis useful in a situation where collaborative training of machine learning\nmodels is necessary while training data are highly sensitive. This study aims\nat investigating the implementation of lightweight federated learning to be\ndeployed on a diverse range of distributed resources, including\nresource-constrained edge devices and resourceful cloud servers. As a resource\nmanagement framework, the FogBus2 framework, which is a containerized\ndistributed resource management framework, is selected as the base framework\nfor the implementation. This research provides an architecture and lightweight\nimplementation of federated learning in the FogBus2. Moreover, a worker\nselection technique is proposed and implemented. The worker selection algorithm\nselects an appropriate set of workers to participate in the training to achieve\nhigher training time efficiency. Besides, this research integrates synchronous\nand asynchronous models of federated learning alongside with heuristic-based\nworker selection algorithm. It is proven that asynchronous federated learning\nis more time efficient compared to synchronous federated learning or sequential\nmachine learning training. The performance evaluation shows the efficiency of\nthe federated learning mechanism implemented and integrated with the FogBus2\nframework. The worker selection strategy obtains 33.9% less time to reach 80%\naccuracy compared to sequential training, while asynchronous further improve\nsynchronous federated learning training time by 63.3%.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a new decentralized learning used for training\nmachine learning algorithms where a global model iteratively gathers the\nparameters of local models but does not access their local data. A key\nchallenge in FL is to handle the heterogeneity of local data distribution,\nresulting in a drifted global model, which is hard to converge. To cope with\nthis challenge, current methods adopt different strategies like knowledge\ndistillation, weighted model aggregation, and multi-task learning, as\nregulation. We refer to these approaches as asynchronous FL since they align\nuser models in either a local or post-hoc manner where model drift has already\nhappened or has been underestimated. In this paper, we propose an active and\nsynchronous correlation approach to solve the challenge of user heterogeneity\nin FL. Specifically, we aim to approximate FL as the standard deep learning by\nactively and synchronously scheduling user learning pace in each round with a\ndynamic multi-phase curriculum. A global curriculum ensembles all user\ncurriculum on its server by the auto-regressive auto-encoder. Then the global\ncurriculum is divided into multiple phases and broadcast to users to measure\nand align the domain-agnostic learning pace. Empirical studies demonstrate that\nour approach equips FL with state-of-the-art generalization performance over\nexisting asynchronous approaches, even facing severe user heterogeneity.",

Hence, there has been a growing\ninterest in considering the user's situation when recommending music to users.\nPrevious works have proposed user-aware autotaggers to infer situation-related\ntags from music content and user's global listening preferences. However, in a\npractical music retrieval system, the autotagger could be only used by assuming\nthat the context class is explicitly provided by the user. In this work, for\ndesigning a fully automatised music retrieval system, we propose to\ndisambiguate the user's listening information from their stream data. Namely,\nwe propose a system which can generate a situational playlist for a user at a\ncertain time 1) by leveraging user-aware music autotaggers, and 2) by\nautomatically inferring the user's situation from stream data (e.g. device,\nnetwork) and user's general profile information (e.g. age).

Delving into the\noptimization process of adversarial training, we find that robust connectivity\npatterns emerge in the early training phase (typically $0.15\\sim0.3$ epochs),\nfar before parameters converge. Inspired by this finding, we dig out robust\nearly-bird tickets (i.e., subnetworks) to develop an efficient adversarial\ntraining method: (1) searching for robust tickets with structured sparsity in\nthe early stage; (2) fine-tuning robust tickets in the remaining time. To\nextract the robust tickets as early as possible, we design a ticket convergence\nmetric to automatically terminate the searching process.

    "abstract": "Medical drug infusion problems pose a combination of challenges such as\nnonlinearities from physiological models, model uncertainty due to inter- and\nintra-patient variability, as well as strict safety specifications. With these\nchallenges in mind, we propose a novel real-time Nonlinear Model Predictive\nControl (NMPC) scheme based on projected gradient descent iterations. At each\niteration, a small number of steps along the gradient of the NMPC cost is\ntaken, generating a suboptimal input which asymptotically converges to the\noptimal input. We retrieve classical Lyapunov stability guarantees by\nperforming a sufficient number of gradient iterations until fulfilling a\nstopping criteria. Such a real-time control approach allows for higher sampling\nrates and faster feedback from the system which is advantageous for the class\nof highly variable and uncertain drug infusion problems. To demonstrate the\ncontroller's potential, we apply it to hypnosis control in anesthesia of two\ninteracting drugs. The controller successfully regulates hypnosis even under\ndisturbances and uncertainty and fulfils benchmark performance criteria.",

    "abstract": "When taking photos under an environment with insufficient light, the exposure\ntime and the sensor gain usually require to be carefully chosen to obtain\nimages with satisfying visual quality. For example, the images with high ISO\nusually have inescapable noise, while the long-exposure ones may be blurry due\nto camera shake or object motion. Existing solutions generally suggest to seek\na balance between noise and blur, and learn denoising or deblurring models\nunder either full- or self-supervision. However, the real-world training pairs\nare difficult to collect, and the self-supervised methods merely rely on blurry\nor noisy images are limited in performance. In this work, we tackle this\nproblem by jointly leveraging the short-exposure noisy image and the\nlong-exposure blurry image for better image restoration. Such setting is\npractically feasible due to that short-exposure and long-exposure images can be\neither acquired by two individual cameras or synthesized by a long burst of\nimages. Moreover, the short-exposure images are hardly blurry, and the\nlong-exposure ones have negligible noise. Their complementarity makes it\nfeasible to learn restoration model in a self-supervised manner. Specifically,\nthe noisy images can be used as the supervision information for deblurring,\nwhile the sharp areas in the blurry images can be utilized as the auxiliary\nsupervision information for self-supervised denoising. By learning in a\ncollaborative manner, the deblurring and denoising tasks in our method can\nbenefit each other.

We introduce a family of algorithms that under mild assumptions\nrecover the signal $X^*$ in all estimation problems for which there exists a\nsum-of-squares algorithm that succeeds in recovering the signal $X^*$ when the\nnoise $N$ is Gaussian. This essentially shows that it is enough to design a\nsum-of-squares algorithm for an estimation problem with Gaussian noise in order\nto get the algorithm that works with the symmetric noise model. Our framework\nextends far beyond previous results on symmetric noise models and is even\nrobust to adversarial perturbations.\nAs concrete examples, we investigate two problems for which no efficient\nalgorithms were known to work for heavy-tailed noise: tensor PCA and sparse\nPCA. For the former, our algorithm recovers the principal component in\npolynomial time when the signal-to-noise ratio is at least\n$\\tilde{O}(n^{p/4}/\\alpha)$, that matches (up to logarithmic factors) current\nbest known algorithmic guarantees for Gaussian noise. For the latter, our\nalgorithm runs in quasipolynomial time and matches the state-of-the-art\nguarantees for quasipolynomial time algorithms in the case of Gaussian noise.\nUsing a reduction from the planted clique problem, we provide evidence that the\nquasipolynomial time is likely to be necessary for sparse PCA with symmetric\nnoise.\nIn our proofs we use bounds on the covering numbers of sets of\npseudo-expectations, which we obtain by certifying in sum-of-squares upper\nbounds on the Gaussian complexities of sets of solutions.

    "title": "Floor Plan Exploration Framework Based on Similarity Distances",
    "abstract": "Computational methods to compute similarities between floor plans can help\narchitects explore floor plans in large datasets to avoid duplication of\ndesigns and to search for existing plans that satisfy their needs. Recently,\nLayoutGMN delivered state-of-the-art performance for computing similarity\nscores between floor plans. However, the high computational costs of LayoutGMN\nmake it unsuitable for the aforementioned applications. In this paper, we\nsignificantly reduced the times needed to query results computed by LayoutGMN\nby projecting the floor plans into a common low-dimensional (e.g., three) data\nspace. The projection is done by optimizing for coordinates of floor plans with\nEuclidean distances mimicking their similarity scores originally calculated by\nLayoutGMN. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that our results match\nthe distributions of the original LayoutGMN similarity scores. User study shows\nthat our similarity results largely match human expectations.",

This selective sequencing opens the door to important applications\nsuch as rapid and low-cost genetic tests. The latency in analyzing should be as\nlow as possible for selective sequencing to be effective so that unnecessary\nreads can be rejected as early as possible.

However, two drawbacks of existing datasets limit event\nrelation extraction (ERE) tasks: (1) Small scale. Due to the annotation\ncomplexity, the data scale of existing datasets is limited, which cannot well\ntrain and evaluate data-hungry models. (2) Absence of unified annotation.\nDifferent types of event relations naturally interact with each other, but\nexisting datasets only cover limited relation types at once, which prevents\nmodels from taking full advantage of relation interactions.

The introduction of IGA enables a unified simulation\nframework based on a single geometry representation for both design and\nanalysis. The coupling of reduced basis methods with IGA has been motivated in\nparticular by their combined capabilities for geometric design and solution of\nparameterized geometries. In most IGA applications, the geometry is modelled by\nmultiple patches with different physical or geometrical parameters. In\nparticular, we are interested in nonaffine problems characterized by a\nhigh-dimensional parameter space. We consider the Empirical Interpolation\nMethod (EIM) to recover an affine parametric dependence and combine domain\ndecomposition to reduce the dimensionality. We couple spline patches in a\nparameterized setting, where multiple evaluations are performed for a given set\nof geometrical parameters, and employ the Static Condensation Reduced Basis\nElement (SCRBE) method. At the common interface between adjacent patches a\nstatic condensation procedure is employed, whereas in the interior a reduced\nbasis approximation enables an efficient offline/online decomposition. The full\norder model over which we setup the RB formulation is based on NURBS\napproximation, whereas the reduced basis construction relies on techniques such\nas the Greedy algorithm or proper orthogonal decomposition (POD).

However, it remains\nunclear how the skills required to handle these tasks distribute among model\nparameters. In this paper, we find that after prompt tuning for specific tasks,\nthe activations of some neurons within pre-trained Transformers are highly\npredictive of the task labels. We dub these neurons skill neurons and confirm\nthey encode task-specific skills by finding that: (1) Skill neurons are crucial\nfor handling tasks. Performances of pre-trained Transformers on a task\nsignificantly drop when corresponding skill neurons are perturbed. (2) Skill\nneurons are task-specific. Similar tasks tend to have similar distributions of\nskill neurons. Furthermore, we demonstrate the skill neurons are most likely\ngenerated in pre-training rather than fine-tuning by showing that the skill\nneurons found with prompt tuning are also crucial for other fine-tuning methods\nfreezing neuron weights, such as the adapter-based tuning and BitFit. We also\nexplore the applications of skill neurons, including accelerating Transformers\nwith network pruning and building better transferability indicators.

    "abstract": "To eliminate the requirement of fully-labeled data for supervised model\ntraining in traditional Federated Learning (FL), extensive attention has been\npaid to the application of Self-supervised Learning (SSL) approaches on FL to\ntackle the label scarcity problem. Previous works on Federated SSL generally\nfall into two categories: parameter-based model aggregation (i.e., FedAvg,\napplicable to homogeneous cases) or data-based feature sharing (i.e., knowledge\ndistillation, applicable to heterogeneous cases) to achieve knowledge transfer\namong multiple unlabeled clients. Despite the progress, all of them inevitably\nrely on some assumptions, such as homogeneous models or the existence of an\nadditional public dataset, which hinder the universality of the training\nframeworks for more general scenarios. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a\nnovel and general method named Federated Self-supervised Learning with\nFeature-correlation based Aggregation (FedFoA) to tackle the above limitations\nin a communication-efficient and privacy-preserving manner. Our insight is to\nutilize feature correlation to align the feature mappings and calibrate the\nlocal model updates across clients during their local training process. More\nspecifically, we design a factorization-based method to extract the\ncross-feature relation matrix from the local representations. Then, the\nrelation matrix can be regarded as a carrier of semantic information to perform\nthe aggregation phase. We prove that FedFoA is a model-agnostic training\nframework and can be easily compatible with state-of-the-art unsupervised FL\nmethods. Extensive empirical experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach\noutperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.",

    "abstract": "Making line segment detectors more reliable under motion blurs is one of the\nmost important challenges for practical applications, such as visual SLAM and\n3D reconstruction. Existing line segment detection methods face severe\nperformance degradation for accurately detecting and locating line segments\nwhen motion blur occurs. While event data shows strong complementary\ncharacteristics to images for minimal blur and edge awareness at high-temporal\nresolution, potentially beneficial for reliable line segment recognition. To\nrobustly detect line segments over motion blurs, we propose to leverage the\ncomplementary information of images and events. To achieve this, we first\ndesign a general frame-event feature fusion network to extract and fuse the\ndetailed image textures and low-latency event edges, which consists of a\nchannel-attention-based shallow fusion module and a self-attention-based dual\nhourglass module. We then utilize two state-of-the-art wireframe parsing\nnetworks to detect line segments on the fused feature map. Besides, we\ncontribute a synthetic and a realistic dataset for line segment detection,\ni.e., FE-Wireframe and FE-Blurframe, with pairwise motion-blurred images and\nevents. Extensive experiments on both datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed method. When tested on the real dataset, our method achieves 63.3%\nmean structural average precision (msAP) with the model pre-trained on the\nFE-Wireframe and fine-tuned on the FE-Blurframe, improved by 32.6 and 11.3\npoints compared with models trained on synthetic only and real only,\nrespectively.

Our results reveal irregular patterns of PID understanding\nand certainty across all participants, though statistically significant\ndisciplinary and academic job role differences were observed in some instances.\nUncertainty and confusion were found to exist in relation to dominant schemes\nsuch as ORCID and DOIs, even when contextualized within real-world examples. We\nalso show researchers' perceptions of PIDs to be generally positive but that\ndisciplinary differences can be noted, as well as higher levels of aversion to\nPIDs in specific use cases and negative perceptions where PIDs are measured on\nan 'activity' semantic dimension. This work therefore contributes to our\nunderstanding of academics' 'PID literacy' and should inform those designing\nPID-centric scholarly infrastructures, that a significant need for training and\noutreach to active researchers remains necessary.",

    "abstract": "Over the past years, the main research innovations in face recognition\nfocused on training deep neural networks on large-scale identity-labeled\ndatasets using variations of multi-class classification losses. However, many\nof these datasets are retreated by their creators due to increased privacy and\nethical concerns. Very recently, privacy-friendly synthetic data has been\nproposed as an alternative to privacy-sensitive authentic data to comply with\nprivacy regulations and to ensure the continuity of face recognition research.\nIn this paper, we propose an unsupervised face recognition model based on\nunlabeled synthetic data (USynthFace). Our proposed USynthFace learns to\nmaximize the similarity between two augmented images of the same synthetic\ninstance. We enable this by a large set of geometric and color transformations\nin addition to GAN-based augmentation that contributes to the USynthFace model\ntraining. We also conduct numerous empirical studies on different components of\nour USynthFace. With the proposed set of augmentation operations, we proved the\neffectiveness of our USynthFace in achieving relatively high recognition\naccuracies using unlabeled synthetic data.",

Nonetheless, neural networks offer a strong foundation to\ndigest physical-driven or knowledge-based constraints during training.\nGenerally speaking, there are three distinct neural network frameworks to\nenforce underlying physics: (i) physics-guided neural networks (PgNN), (ii)\nphysics-informed neural networks (PiNN) and (iii) physics-encoded neural\nnetworks (PeNN). These approaches offer unique advantages to accelerate the\nmodeling of complex multiscale multi-physics phenomena.

This study\naims to present an in-depth review of the three neural network frameworks\n(i.e., PgNN, PiNN, and PeNN) used in scientific computing research. The\nstate-of-the-art architectures and their applications are reviewed; limitations\nare discussed; and future research opportunities in terms of improving\nalgorithms, considering causalities, expanding applications, and coupling\nscientific and deep learning solvers are presented.

The importance of this task motivated researchers to organize\nthe BraTS-Reg challenge, jointly with IEEE ISBI 2022 and MICCAI 2022\nconferences. The organizers introduced the task of aligning pre-operative to\nfollow-up magnetic resonance images of glioma. The main difficulties are\nconnected with the missing data leading to large, nonrigid, and noninvertible\ndeformations. In this work, we describe our contributions to both the editions\nof the BraTS-Reg challenge. The proposed method is based on combined deep\nlearning and instance optimization approaches. First, the instance optimization\nenriches the state-of-the-art LapIRN method to improve the generalizability and\nfine-details preservation. Second, an additional objective function weighting\nis introduced, based on the inverse consistency. The proposed method is fully\nunsupervised and exhibits high registration quality and robustness.

Users gradually\nlook for the target of interest by moving from coarse to fine-grained feedback.\nHowever, existing methods merely focus on the latter, i.e, fine-grained search,\nby harnessing positive and negative pairs during training. This pair-based\nparadigm only considers the one-to-one distance between a pair of specific\npoints, which is not aligned with the one-to-many coarse-grained retrieval\nprocess and compromises the recall rate. In an attempt to fill this gap, we\nintroduce a unified learning approach to simultaneously modeling the coarse-\nand fine-grained retrieval by considering the multi-grained uncertainty. The\nkey idea underpinning the proposed method is to integrate fine- and\ncoarse-grained retrieval as matching data points with small and large\nfluctuations, respectively. Specifically, our method contains two modules:\nuncertainty modeling and uncertainty regularization. (1) The uncertainty\nmodeling simulates the multi-grained queries by introducing identically\ndistributed fluctuations in the feature space. (2) Based on the uncertainty\nmodeling, we further introduce uncertainty regularization to adapt the matching\nobjective according to the fluctuation range. Compared with existing methods,\nthe proposed strategy explicitly prevents the model from pushing away potential\ncandidates in the early stage, and thus improves the recall rate.

We formalize this assumption as a ``ball structure'' action\nspace, and show that being able to freely explore the feature space allows for\nefficient RL. In particular, we propose a sample-efficient RL algorithm\n(BallRL) that learns an $\\epsilon$-optimal policy using only\n$\\tilde{O}\\left(\\frac{H^5d^3}{\\epsilon^3}\\right)$ number of trajectories.",

    "title": "Regression-based Monte Carlo Integration",
    "abstract": "Monte Carlo integration is typically interpreted as an estimator of the\nexpected value using stochastic samples. There exists an alternative\ninterpretation in calculus where Monte Carlo integration can be seen as\nestimating a \\emph{constant} function -- from the stochastic evaluations of the\nintegrand -- that integrates to the original integral. The integral mean value\ntheorem states that this \\emph{constant} function should be the mean (or\nexpectation) of the integrand. Since both interpretations result in the same\nestimator, little attention has been devoted to the calculus-oriented\ninterpretation. We show that the calculus-oriented interpretation actually\nimplies the possibility of using a more \\emph{complex} function than a\n\\emph{constant} one to construct a more efficient estimator for Monte Carlo\nintegration. We build a new estimator based on this interpretation and relate\nour estimator to control variates with least-squares regression on the\nstochastic samples of the integrand. Unlike prior work, our resulting estimator\nis \\emph{provably} better than or equal to the conventional Monte Carlo\nestimator. To demonstrate the strength of our approach, we introduce a\npractical estimator that can act as a simple drop-in replacement for\nconventional Monte Carlo integration. We experimentally validate our framework\non various light transport integrals. The code is available at\n\\url{https://github.com/iribis/regressionmc}.",

The\nAI4Food-NutritionDB opens the doors to new food computing approaches in terms\nof food intake frequency, quality, and categorisation.

    "abstract": "Video anomaly detection (VAD) has been intensively studied for years because\nof its potential applications in intelligent video systems. Existing\nunsupervised VAD methods tend to learn normality from training sets consisting\nof only normal videos and regard instances deviating from such normality as\nanomalies. However, they often consider only local or global normality. Some of\nthem focus on learning local spatiotemporal representations from consecutive\nframes in video clips to enhance the representation for normal events. But\npowerful representation allows these methods to represent some anomalies and\ncauses missed detections. In contrast, the other methods are devoted to\nmemorizing global prototypical patterns of whole training videos to weaken the\ngeneralization for anomalies, which also restricts them to represent diverse\nnormal patterns and causes false alarms. To this end, we propose a two-branch\nmodel, Local-Global Normality Network (LGN-Net), to learn local and global\nnormality simultaneously. Specifically, one branch learns the evolution\nregularities of appearance and motion from consecutive frames as local\nnormality utilizing a spatiotemporal prediction network, while the other branch\nmemorizes prototype features of the whole videos as global normality by a\nmemory module. LGN-Net achieves a balance of representing normal and abnormal\ninstances by fusing local and global normality. The fused normality enables our\nmodel more generalized to various scenes compared to exploiting single\nnormality. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance\nof our method.

    "abstract": "Network slicing envisions the 5th generation (5G) mobile network resource\nallocation to be based on different requirements for different services, such\nas Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC) and Enhanced Mobile\nBroadband (eMBB). Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN), proposes an open and\ndisaggregated concept of RAN by modulizing the functionalities into independent\ncomponents. Network slicing for O-RAN can significantly improve performance.\nTherefore, an advanced resource allocation solution for network slicing in\nO-RAN is proposed in this study by applying Reinforcement Learning (RL). This\nresearch demonstrates an RL compatible simplified edge network simulator with\nthree components, user equipment(UE), Edge O-Cloud, and Regional O-Cloud. This\nsimulator is later used to discover how to improve throughput for targeted\nnetwork slice(s) by dynamically allocating unused bandwidth from other slices.\nIncreasing the throughput for certain network slicing can also benefit the end\nusers with a higher average data rate, peak rate, or shorter transmission time.\nThe results show that the RL model can provide eMBB traffic with a high peak\nrate and shorter transmission time for URLLC compared to balanced and eMBB\nfocus baselines.",

    "abstract": "Double-blind peer review is considered a pillar of academic research because\nit is perceived to ensure a fair, unbiased, and fact-centered scientific\ndiscussion. Yet, experienced researchers can often correctly guess from which\nresearch group an anonymous submission originates, biasing the peer-review\nprocess. In this work, we present a transformer-based, neural-network\narchitecture that only uses the text content and the author names in the\nbibliography to atttribute an anonymous manuscript to an author. To train and\nevaluate our method, we created the largest authorship-identification dataset\nto date. It leverages all research papers publicly available on arXiv amounting\nto over 2 million manuscripts. In arXiv-subsets with up to 2,000 different\nauthors, our method achieves an unprecedented authorship attribution accuracy,\nwhere up to 95% of papers are attributed correctly. Thanks to our method, we\nare not only able to predict the author of an anonymous work but we also\nidentify weaknesses of the double-blind review process by finding the key\naspects that make a paper attributable. We believe that this work gives\nprecious insights into how a submission can remain anonymous in order to\nsupport an unbiased double-blind review process.",

    "abstract": "It's been controversial whether re-opening school will facilitate viral\nspread among household communities with mitigation strategies such as\nmask-wearing in place. In this work, we propose an epidemiological model that\nexplores the viral transmission over the multi-layer contact network composed\nof the school layer and community layer with population heterogeneity on\nmask-wearing behavior. We derive analytical expressions for three key\nepidemiological quantities: the probability of emergence, the epidemic\nthreshold, and the expected epidemic size. In particular, we show how the\naforementioned quantities depend on the structure of the multi-layer contact\nnetwork, viral transmission dynamics, and the distribution of the different\ntypes of masks within the population. Through extensive simulations, our\nanalytical results show near-perfect agreement with the simulation results with\na limited number of nodes. Utilizing the model, we study the impact of the\nopening/closure of the school layer on the viral transmission dynamics with\nvarious mask-wearing scenarios. Interestingly, we found that it's safe to open\nthe school layer with the proper proportion of good-quality masks in the\npopulation. Moreover, we validate the theory of the trade-off between\nsource-control and self-protection over a single layer by Tian et al on our\nmulti-layer setting. We conclude that even on a multi-layer network, it's of\ngreat significance to treat the spreading process as two distinct phases in\nmind when considering mitigation strategies. Besides, we would like to remark\nthat our model of spreading process over multi-layer networks with population\nheterogeneity can also be applied to various other domains, such as\nmisinformation control.",

    "title": "Electroadhesive Clutches for Programmable Shape Morphing of Soft  Actuators",
    "abstract": "Soft robotic actuators are safe and adaptable devices with inherent\ncompliance, which makes them attractive for manipulating delicate and complex\nobjects. Researchers have integrated stiff materials into soft actuators to\nincrease their force capacity and direct their deformation. However, these\nembedded materials have largely been pre-prescribed and static, which\nconstrains the actuators to a predetermined range of motion. In this work,\nelectroadhesive (EA) clutches integrated on a single-chamber soft pneumatic\nactuator (SPA) provide local programmable stiffness modulation to control the\nactuator deformation. We show that activating different clutch patterns\ninflates a silicone membrane into pyramidal, round, and plateau shapes.\nCurvatures from these shapes are combined during actuation to apply forces on\nboth a 3.7 g and 820 g object along five different degrees of freedom (DoF).\nThe actuator workspace is up to 12 mm for light objects. Clutch deactivation,\nwhich results in local elastomeric expansion, rapidly applies forces up to 3.2\nN to an object resting on the surface and launches a 3.7 g object in controlled\ndirections. The actuator also rotates a heavier, 820 g, object by 5 degrees and\nrapidly restores it to horizontal alignment after clutch deactivation. This\nactuator is fully powered by a 5 V battery, AA battery, DC-DC transformer, and\n4.5 V (63 g) DC air pump. These results demonstrate a first step towards\nrealizing a soft actuator with high DoF shape change that preserves the\ninherent benefits of pneumatic actuation while gaining the electrical\ncontrollability and strength of EA clutches. We envision such a system\nsupplying human contact forces in the form of a low-profile sit-to-stand\nassistance device, bed-ridden patient manipulator, or other ergonomic\nmechanism.\nThis technology was also demonstrated at ICRA 2022:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Y6-iHWNi6s",

    "abstract": "Many learning tasks in physics and chemistry involve global spatial\nsymmetries as well as permutational symmetry between particles. The standard\napproach to such problems is equivariant neural networks, which employ tensor\nproducts between various tensors that transform under the spatial group.\nHowever, as the number of different tensors and the complexity of relationships\nbetween them increases, the bookkeeping associated with ensuring parsimony as\nwell as equivariance quickly becomes nontrivial. In this paper, we propose to\nuse fusion diagrams, a technique widely used in simulating SU($2$)-symmetric\nquantum many-body problems, to design new equivariant components for use in\nequivariant neural networks. This yields a diagrammatic approach to\nconstructing new neural network architectures. We show that when applied to\nparticles in a given local neighborhood, the resulting components, which we\ncall fusion blocks, are universal approximators of any continuous equivariant\nfunction defined on the neighborhood. As a practical demonstration, we\nincorporate a fusion block into a pre-existing equivariant architecture\n(Cormorant) and show that it improves performance on benchmark molecular\nlearning tasks.",

Indeed, in Homotopy Type Theory, properties and structures\ncan be transported over type equivalences. However, we may wish to explain the\nequivalence principle without relying on the univalence axiom. For example, all\ntype formers preserve equivalences in most type theories; thus it should be\npossible to transport structures over type equivalences even in non-univalent\ntype theories.\nWe define external univalence, a property of type theories (and more general\nsecond-order generalized algebraic theories) that captures the preservation of\nequivalences (or other homotopy relations). This property is defined\nsyntactically, as the existence of identity types on the (syntactically\ndefined) coclassifying (Sigma,Pi_rep)-CwF (also called generic model or walking\nmodel) of the theory. Semantically, it corresponds to the existence of some\nleft semi-model structure on the category of models of the theory.

In this work, we first propose an\nend-to-end training framework for intermediate 2D keypoints extraction and\nfinal 3D shape and pose estimation. The proposed framework is then trained\nusing only the weak supervision of the intermediate 2D keypoints.

    "abstract": "Resolving ambiguities in questions is key to successfully answering them.\nFocusing on questions about images, we create a dataset of ambiguous examples;\nwe annotate these examples, grouping the answers by the underlying question\nthey address and rephrasing the question for each group to reduce ambiguity. An\nanalysis of our data reveals a linguistically-aligned ontology of reasons for\nambiguity in visual questions. We then develop an English question-generation\nmodel which we demonstrate via automatic and human evaluation produces less\nambiguous questions.

    "abstract": "Recent work on explainable NLP has shown that few-shot prompting can enable\nlarge pretrained language models (LLMs) to generate grammatical and factual\nnatural language explanations for data labels. In this work, we study the\nconnection between explainability and sample hardness by investigating the\nfollowing research question - \"Are LLMs and humans equally good at explaining\ndata labels for both easy and hard samples?\" We answer this question by first\ncollecting human-written explanations in the form of generalizable commonsense\nrules on the task of Winograd Schema Challenge (Winogrande dataset). We compare\nthese explanations with those generated by GPT-3 while varying the hardness of\nthe test samples as well as the in-context samples. We observe that (1) GPT-3\nexplanations are as grammatical as human explanations regardless of the\nhardness of the test samples, (2) for easy examples, GPT-3 generates highly\nsupportive explanations but human explanations are more generalizable, and (3)\nfor hard examples, human explanations are significantly better than GPT-3\nexplanations both in terms of label-supportiveness and generalizability\njudgements. We also find that hardness of the in-context examples impacts the\nquality of GPT-3 explanations. Finally, we show that the supportiveness and\ngeneralizability aspects of human explanations are also impacted by sample\nhardness, although by a much smaller margin than models.

It has emerged as one of the\nmost convenient and natural methods to interact with the web and is especially\ndesirable in voice-controlled environments. Despite being one of the oldest\nresearch areas, the current QA system faces the critical challenge of handling\nmultilingual queries. To build an Artificial Intelligent (AI) agent that can\nserve multilingual end users, a QA system is required to be language versatile\nand tailored to suit the multilingual environment. Recent advances in QA models\nhave enabled surpassing human performance primarily due to the availability of\na sizable amount of high-quality datasets. However, the majority of such\nannotated datasets are expensive to create and are only confined to the English\nlanguage, making it challenging to acknowledge progress in foreign languages.\nTherefore, to measure a similar improvement in the multilingual QA system, it\nis necessary to invest in high-quality multilingual evaluation benchmarks. In\nthis dissertation, we focus on advancing QA techniques for handling end-user\nqueries in multilingual environments. This dissertation consists of two parts.\nIn the first part, we explore multilingualism and a new dimension of\nmultilingualism referred to as code-mixing. Second, we propose a technique to\nsolve the task of multi-hop question generation by exploiting multiple\ndocuments. Experiments show our models achieve state-of-the-art performance on\nanswer extraction, ranking, and generation tasks on multiple domains of MQA,\nVQA, and language generation. The proposed techniques are generic and can be\nwidely used in various domains and languages to advance QA systems.",

It is a thriving activity today, however formalisation remains\ncumbersome. In this paper, we explore the abilities of a large language model\n(Codex) to help with formalisation in the Lean theorem prover. We find that\nwith careful input-dependent prompt selection and postprocessing, Codex is able\nto formalise short mathematical statements at undergrad level with nearly 75\\%\naccuracy for $120$ theorem statements. For proofs quantitative analysis is\ninfeasible and we undertake a detailed case study. We choose a diverse set of\n$13$ theorems at undergrad level with proofs that fit in two-three paragraphs.\nWe show that with a new prompting strategy Codex can formalise these proofs in\nnatural language with at least one out of twelve Codex completion being easy to\nrepair into a complete proof. This is surprising as essentially no aligned data\nexists for formalised mathematics, particularly for proofs. These results\nsuggest that large language models are a promising avenue towards fully or\npartially automating formalisation.",

The literature of algorithmic fairness has grown\nconsiderably over the last decade, where most of the approaches are evaluated\nunder the strong assumption that the train and test samples are independently\nand identically drawn from the same underlying distribution. However, in\npractice, dissimilarity between the training and deployment environments\nexists, which compromises the performance of the decision-making algorithm as\nwell as its fairness guarantees in the deployment data. There is an emergent\nresearch line that studies how to preserve fairness guarantees when the data\ngenerating processes differ between the source (train) and target (test)\ndomains, which is growing remarkably. With this survey, we aim to provide a\nwide and unifying overview on the topic.

This effectively makes PIM operations a new\nclass of memory operations, alongside standard memory operations\n(\\textit{e.g.}, load, store). For software correctness, it is crucial to have\nordering rules for a PIM operation with other PIM operations and other memory\noperations, \\textit{i.e.}, a consistency model that takes into account PIM\noperations is vital. To the best of our knowledge, little attention to PIM\noperation consistency has been given in existing works. In this paper, we focus\non a specific PIM approach, named bulk-bitwise PIM. In bulk-bitwise PIM, large\nbitwise operations are performed directly and stored in the memory array. We\nshow that previous solutions for the related topic of maintaining coherency of\nbulk-bitwise PIM have broken the host native consistency model and prevent any\nguaranteed correctness. As a solution, we propose and evaluate four consistency\nmodels for bulk-bitwise PIM, from strict to relaxed. Our designs also preserve\ncoherency between PIM and the host processor. Evaluating the proposed designs'\nperformance with a gem5 simulation, using the YCSB short-range scan benchmark\nand TPC-H queries, shows that the run time overhead of guarantying correctness\nis at most $6\\%$, and in many cases the run time is even improved.

This abstraction allows us\nto identify key structural properties, and corresponding parameters, that\ndetermine the smoothed running time of local search dynamics. We formalize this\nvia a black-box tool that provides concrete bounds on the expected maximum\nnumber of steps needed until local search reaches an exact local optimum. This\nbound is particularly strong, in the sense that it holds for any starting\nfeasible solution, any choice of pivoting rule, and does not rely on the choice\nof specific noise distributions that are applied on the input, but it is\nparameterized by just a global upper bound $\\phi$ on the probability density.\nWe then demonstrate the power of this tool, by instantiating it for various\nPLS-hard problems to derive efficient smoothed running times. This not only\nunifies, and greatly simplifies, prior existing positive results, but also\nallows us to extend or improve them. Notable problems on which we provide such\na contribution are Max-Cut, the Travelling Salesman problem, and Network\nCoordination Games. Additionally, in this paper we propose novel smoothed\nanalysis formulations, and prove polynomial smoothed running times, for\nimportant local optimization problems that have not been studied before from\nthis perspective.

    "abstract": "Many standard graph classes are known to be characterized by means of layouts\n(a permutation of its vertices) excluding some patterns. Important such graph\nclasses are among others: proper interval graphs, interval graphs, chordal\ngraphs, permutation graphs, (co-)comparability graphs. For example, a graph\n$G=(V,E)$ is a proper interval graph if and only if $G$ has a layout $L$ such\nthat for every triple of vertices such that $x\\prec_L y\\prec_L z$, if $xz\\in\nE$, then $xy\\in E$ and $yz\\in E$. Such a triple $x$, $y$, $z$ is called an\nindifference triple and layouts excluding indifference triples are known as\nindifference layouts.\nIn this paper, we investigate the concept of tree-layouts. A tree-layout\n$T_G=(T,r,\\rho_G)$ of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a tree $T$ rooted at some node $r$\nand equipped with a one-to-one mapping $\\rho_G$ between $V$ and the nodes of\n$T$ such that for every edge $xy\\in E$, either $x$ is an ancestor of $y$ or $y$\nis an ancestor of $x$. Clearly, layouts are tree-layouts.\nExcluding a pattern in a tree-layout is defined similarly as excluding a\npattern in a layout, but now using the ancestor relation. Unexplored graph\nclasses can be defined by means of tree-layouts excluding some patterns. As a\nproof of concept, we show that excluding non-indifference triples in\ntree-layouts yields a natural notion of proper chordal graphs. We characterize\nproper chordal graphs and position them in the hierarchy of known subclasses of\nchordal graphs. We also provide a canonical representation of proper chordal\ngraphs that encodes all the indifference tree-layouts rooted at some vertex.\nBased on this result, we first design a polynomial time recognition algorithm\nfor proper chordal graphs. We then show that the problem of testing isomorphism\nbetween two proper chordal graphs is in P, whereas this problem is known to be\nGI-complete on chordal graphs.",

    "title": "Self-distillation with Online Diffusion on Batch Manifolds Improves Deep  Metric Learning",
    "abstract": "Recent deep metric learning (DML) methods typically leverage solely class\nlabels to keep positive samples far away from negative ones. However, this type\nof method normally ignores the crucial knowledge hidden in the data (e.g.,\nintra-class information variation), which is harmful to the generalization of\nthe trained model. To alleviate this problem, in this paper we propose Online\nBatch Diffusion-based Self-Distillation (OBD-SD) for DML. Specifically, we\nfirst propose a simple but effective Progressive Self-Distillation (PSD), which\ndistills the knowledge progressively from the model itself during training. The\nsoft distance targets achieved by PSD can present richer relational information\namong samples, which is beneficial for the diversity of embedding\nrepresentations. Then, we extend PSD with an Online Batch Diffusion Process\n(OBDP), which is to capture the local geometric structure of manifolds in each\nbatch, so that it can reveal the intrinsic relationships among samples in the\nbatch and produce better soft distance targets. Note that our OBDP is able to\nrestore the insufficient manifold relationships obtained by the original PSD\nand achieve significant performance improvement. Our OBD-SD is a flexible\nframework that can be integrated into state-of-the-art (SOTA) DML methods.\nExtensive experiments on various benchmarks, namely CUB200, CARS196, and\nStanford Online Products, demonstrate that our OBD-SD consistently improves the\nperformance of the existing DML methods on multiple datasets with negligible\nadditional training time, achieving very competitive results.

    "title": "SlabLU: A Sparse Direct Solver for Elliptic PDEs on Rectangular Domains",
    "abstract": "The paper describes a sparse direct solver for the linear systems that arise\nfrom the discretization of an elliptic PDE on a rectangular domains. The scheme\ndecomposes the domain into thin subdomains, or ``slabs''. Within each slab, a\nlocal factorization is executed that exploits the geometry of the local domain.\nA global factorization is then obtained through the LU factorization of a\nblock-tridiagonal reduced system. The general two-level framework is easier to\nimplement and optimize for modern latency-bound architectures than traditional\nmulti-frontal schemes based on hierarchical nested dissection orderings. The\nsolver has complexity $O(N^{5/3})$ for the factorization step, and $O(N^{7/6})$\nfor each solve once the factorization is completed. The solver described is\ncompatible with a range of different local discretizations, and numerical\nexperiments demonstrate its high performance for standard finite difference\ndiscretizations on a regular grid. The technique becomes particularly efficient\nwhen combined with very high-order convergent multi-domain spectral collocation\nschemes. With this discretization, a Helmholtz problem on a domain of size\n$1000 \\lambda \\times 1000 \\lambda$ (for which $N$=100M) is solved in 15 minutes\nto 6 correct digits on a high-powered desktop.",

    "abstract": "The field of deep-learning-based ECG analysis has been largely dominated by\nconvolutional architectures. This work explores the prospects of applying the\nrecently introduced structured state space models (SSMs) as a particularly\npromising approach due to its ability to capture long-term dependencies in time\nseries. We demonstrate that this approach leads to significant improvements\nover the current state-of-the-art for ECG classification, which we trace back\nto individual pathologies. Furthermore, the model's ability to capture\nlong-term dependencies allows to shed light on long-standing questions in the\nliterature such as the optimal sampling rate or window size to train\nclassification models. Interestingly, we find no evidence for using data\nsampled at 500Hz as opposed to 100Hz and no advantages from extending the\nmodel's input size beyond 3s. Based on this very promising first assessment,\nSSMs could develop into a new modeling paradigm for ECG analysis.",

    "abstract": "The current approach to marking attendance in colleges is tedious and time\nconsuming. I propose AttenFace, a standalone system to analyze, track and grant\nattendance in real time using face recognition. Using snapshots of class from\nlive camera feed, the system identifies students and marks them as present in a\nclass based on their presence in multiple snapshots taken throughout the class\nduration. Face recognition for each class is performed independently and in\nparallel, ensuring that the system scales with number of concurrent classes.\nFurther, the separation of the face recognition server from the back-end server\nfor attendance calculation allows the face recognition module to be integrated\nwith existing attendance tracking software like Moodle. The face recognition\nalgorithm runs at 10 minute intervals on classroom snapshots, significantly\nreducing computation compared to direct processing of live camera feed. This\nmethod also provides students the flexibility to leave class for a short\nduration (such as for a phone call) without losing attendance for that class.\nAttendance is granted to a student if he remains in class for a number of\nsnapshots above a certain threshold. The system is fully automatic and requires\nno professor intervention or any form of manual attendance or even camera\nset-up, since the back-end directly interfaces with in-class cameras. AttenFace\nis a first-of-its-kind one-stop solution for face-recognition-enabled\nattendance in educational institutions that prevents proxy, handling all\naspects from students checking attendance to professors deciding their own\nattendance policy, to college administration enforcing default attendance\nrules.",

We conducted an empirical study, engaging participants with attack\nsimulation scenarios and analyse their actions, for investigating the security\nawareness of mHealth app users via action-based research. We simulated some\ncommon security attack scenarios in mHealth context and engaged a total of 105\napp users to monitor their actions and analyse their behavior. We analysed\nusers data with statistical analysis including reliability and correlations\ntests, descriptive analysis, and qualitative data analysis.

Users provide their consent,\ngranting permissions, without a careful review of privacy policies that leads\nto undesired or malicious access to health critical data.

The resulting bi-encoder models can guide transformers as a\nresponse ranking model towards a goal in a zero-shot fashion by projecting the\ngoal utterance and the corresponding reply candidates into a latent space. Here\nthe cosine similarity indicates the distance/reachability of a candidate\nutterance towards the corresponding goal which we define as curved space.\nFurthermore, we explore how these forward-entailing language representations\ncan be utilized for assessing the likelihood of sequences by the entailment\nstrength i.e. through the cosine similarity of its individual members (encoded\nseparately) as an emergent property in the curved space. This allows us to\nimagine the likelihood of future patterns in dialogues, specifically by\nordering/identifying future goal utterances that are multiple turns away, given\na dialogue context. As part of our analysis, we investigate characteristics\nthat make conversations (un)plannable and find strong evidence of planning\ncapability over multiple turns (in 61.56\\% over 3 turns) in conversations from\nthe DailyDialog dataset.

    "abstract": "Text-guided image generation has progressed rapidly in recent years,\ninspiring major breakthroughs in text-guided shape generation. Recently, it has\nbeen shown that using score distillation, one can successfully text-guide a\nNeRF model to generate a 3D object. We adapt the score distillation to the\npublicly available, and computationally efficient, Latent Diffusion Models,\nwhich apply the entire diffusion process in a compact latent space of a\npretrained autoencoder. As NeRFs operate in image space, a naive solution for\nguiding them with latent score distillation would require encoding to the\nlatent space at each guidance step. Instead, we propose to bring the NeRF to\nthe latent space, resulting in a Latent-NeRF. Analyzing our Latent-NeRF, we\nshow that while Text-to-3D models can generate impressive results, they are\ninherently unconstrained and may lack the ability to guide or enforce a\nspecific 3D structure. To assist and direct the 3D generation, we propose to\nguide our Latent-NeRF using a Sketch-Shape: an abstract geometry that defines\nthe coarse structure of the desired object. Then, we present means to integrate\nsuch a constraint directly into a Latent-NeRF. This unique combination of text\nand shape guidance allows for increased control over the generation process. We\nalso show that latent score distillation can be successfully applied directly\non 3D meshes. This allows for generating high-quality textures on a given\ngeometry.

Existing UDA methods for semantic segmentation usually focus on\nminimizing the inter-domain discrepancy of various levels, e.g., pixels,\nfeatures, and predictions, for extracting domain-invariant knowledge.

    "abstract": "We provide an overview of recent developments and future directions in the\nRowHammer vulnerability that plagues modern DRAM (Dynamic Random Memory Access)\nchips, which are used in almost all computing systems as main memory.\nRowHammer is the phenomenon in which repeatedly accessing a row in a real\nDRAM chip causes bitflips (i.e., data corruption) in physically nearby rows.\nThis phenomenon leads to a serious and widespread system security\nvulnerability, as many works since the original RowHammer paper in 2014 have\nshown. Recent analysis of the RowHammer phenomenon reveals that the problem is\ngetting much worse as DRAM technology scaling continues: newer DRAM chips are\nfundamentally more vulnerable to RowHammer at the device and circuit levels.\nDeeper analysis of RowHammer shows that there are many dimensions to the\nproblem as the vulnerability is sensitive to many variables, including\nenvironmental conditions (temperature \\& voltage), process variation, stored\ndata patterns, as well as memory access patterns and memory control policies.\nAs such, it has proven difficult to devise fully-secure and very efficient\n(i.e., low-overhead in performance, energy, area) protection mechanisms against\nRowHammer and attempts made by DRAM manufacturers have been shown to lack\nsecurity guarantees.\nAfter reviewing various recent developments in exploiting, understanding, and\nmitigating RowHammer, we discuss future directions that we believe are critical\nfor solving the RowHammer problem. We argue for two major directions to amplify\nresearch and development efforts in: 1) building a much deeper understanding of\nthe problem and its many dimensions, in both cutting-edge DRAM chips and\ncomputing systems deployed in the field, and 2) the design and development of\nextremely efficient and fully-secure solutions via system-memory cooperation.",

    "abstract": "Modern decision-making systems, from robots to web recommendation engines,\nare expected to adapt: to user preferences, changing circumstances or even new\ntasks. Yet, it is still uncommon to deploy a dynamically learning agent (rather\nthan a fixed policy) to a production system, as it's perceived as unsafe. Using\nhistorical data to reason about learning algorithms, similar to offline policy\nevaluation (OPE) applied to fixed policies, could help practitioners evaluate\nand ultimately deploy such adaptive agents to production. In this work, we\nformalize offline learner simulation (OLS) for reinforcement learning (RL) and\npropose a novel evaluation protocol that measures both fidelity and efficiency\nof the simulation. For environments with complex high-dimensional observations,\nwe propose a semi-parametric approach that leverages recent advances in latent\nstate discovery in order to achieve accurate and efficient offline simulations.\nIn preliminary experiments, we show the advantage of our approach compared to\nfully non-parametric baselines. The code to reproduce these experiments will be\nmade available at https://github.com/microsoft/rl-offline-simulation.",

    "abstract": "New smartphone users have difficulty engaging with it and often use only a\nlimited set of features like calling and messaging. These users are hesitant to\nexplore using the smartphone and rely on experienced users to teach them how to\nuse the phone. However, experienced users are not always around to guide them.\nTo help new users learn how to use the phone on their own, we propose a natural\nlanguage based instruction following agent that operates over the UI and shows\nthe user how to perform various tasks. Common how-to questions, such as \"How to\nblock calls from unknown numbers?\", are documented on support sites with a\nsequence of steps in natural language describing what the user should do. We\nparse these steps using Large Language Models (LLMs) and generate macros that\ncan be executed on-device when the user asks a query. To evaluate this agent,\nwe introduce UGIF-DataSet, a multi-lingual, multi-modal UI grounded dataset for\nstep-by-step task completion on the smartphone. It contains 523 natural\nlanguage instructions with paired sequences of multilingual UI screens and\nactions that show how to execute the task in eight languages. We compare the\nperformance of different large language models including PaLM, GPT3, etc. and\nfind that the end-to-end task completion success rate is 48% for English UI but\nthe performance drops to 32% for non-English languages.

    "abstract": "The digital information landscape has introduced a new dimension to\nunderstanding how we collectively react to new information and preserve it at\nthe societal level. This, together with the emergence of platforms such as\nWikipedia, has challenged traditional views on the relationship between current\nevents and historical accounts of events, with an ever-shrinking divide between\n\"news\" and \"history\". Wikipedia's place as the Internet's primary reference\nwork thus poses the question of how it represents both traditional\nencyclopaedic knowledge and evolving important news stories. In other words,\nhow is information on and attention towards current events integrated into the\nexisting topical structures of Wikipedia? To address this we develop a temporal\ncommunity detection approach towards topic detection that takes into account\nboth short term dynamics of attention as well as long term article network\nstructures. We apply this method to a dataset of one year of current events on\nWikipedia to identify clusters distinct from those that would be found solely\nfrom page view time series correlations or static network structure. We are\nable to resolve the topics that more strongly reflect unfolding current events\nvs more established knowledge by the relative importance of collective\nattention dynamics vs link structures. We also offer important developments by\nidentifying and describing the emergent topics on Wikipedia. This work provides\na means of distinguishing how these information and attention clusters are\nrelated to Wikipedia's twin faces of encyclopaedic knowledge and current events\n-- crucial to understanding the production and consumption of knowledge in the\ndigital age.",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms typically use random\nsampling (e.g., $\\epsilon$-greedy) for exploration, but this method fails in\nhard exploration tasks like Montezuma's Revenge. To address the challenge of\nexploration, prior works incentivize the agent to visit novel states using an\nexploration bonus (also called an intrinsic reward or curiosity). Such methods\ncan lead to excellent results on hard exploration tasks but can suffer from\nintrinsic reward bias and underperform when compared to an agent trained using\nonly task rewards. This performance decrease occurs when an agent seeks out\nintrinsic rewards and performs unnecessary exploration even when sufficient\ntask reward is available. This inconsistency in performance across tasks\nprevents the widespread use of intrinsic rewards with RL algorithms. We propose\na principled constrained policy optimization procedure that automatically tunes\nthe importance of the intrinsic reward: it suppresses the intrinsic reward when\nexploration is unnecessary and increases it when exploration is required. This\nresults in superior exploration that does not require manual tuning to balance\nthe intrinsic reward against the task reward.

The traditional\napproach has been to decompose this problem into elevation mapping and foothold\nplanning phases. The elevation mapping, however, is susceptible to failure and\nlarge noise artifacts, requires specialized hardware, and is biologically\nimplausible. In this paper, we present the first end-to-end locomotion system\ncapable of traversing stairs, curbs, stepping stones, and gaps. We show this\nresult on a medium-sized quadruped robot using a single front-facing depth\ncamera. The small size of the robot necessitates discovering specialized gait\npatterns not seen elsewhere. The egocentric camera requires the policy to\nremember past information to estimate the terrain under its hind feet. We train\nour policy in simulation. Training has two phases - first, we train a policy\nusing reinforcement learning with a cheap-to-compute variant of depth image and\nthen in phase 2 distill it into the final policy that uses depth using\nsupervised learning. The resulting policy transfers to the real world and is\nable to run in real-time on the limited compute of the robot.

A novel\nfeature of the proposed method is the use of divergence error to drive the\n$p$-adaptive method. The nature of divergence error is explored and that it is\na direct consequence of the act of discretization is established. Its relation\nwith relative truncation error is formed which enables the use of divergence\nerror as an inexpensive proxy to truncation error. Divergence error is used as\nan indicator to dynamically identify and assign spatial operators of varying\naccuracy to substantial regions in the computational domain.

When the\npredictive model is simple and its evaluation differentiable, this task is\nsolved by the delta method, where we propagate the asymptotically-normal\nuncertainty in the predictive model through the evaluation to compute standard\nerrors and Wald confidence intervals. However, this becomes difficult when the\nmodel and/or evaluation becomes more complex. Remedies include the bootstrap,\nbut it can be computationally infeasible when training the model even once is\ncostly. In this paper, we propose an alternative, the implicit delta method,\nwhich works by infinitesimally regularizing the training loss of the predictive\nmodel to automatically assess downstream uncertainty. We show that the change\nin the evaluation due to regularization is consistent for the asymptotic\nvariance of the evaluation estimator, even when the infinitesimal change is\napproximated by a finite difference. This provides both a reliable\nquantification of uncertainty in terms of standard errors as well as permits\nthe construction of calibrated confidence intervals.

A larger SS model generally achieves better output quality at an\nexpense of higher computation, meanwhile, a better SS model for overlapping\nspeech often produces distorted output for non-overlapping speech. This paper\naddresses these trade-offs with a sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts (MoE). The\nsparsely-gated MoE architecture allows the separation models to be enlarged\nwithout compromising the run-time efficiency, which also helps achieve a better\nseparation-distortion trade-off. To further reduce the speech distortion\nwithout compromising the SS capability, a multi-gate MoE framework is also\nexplored, where different gates handle non-overlapping and overlapping frames\ndifferently. ASR experiments are conducted by using a simulated dataset for\nmeasuring both the speech separation accuracy and the speech distortion. Two\nadvanced SS models, Conformer and WavLM-based models, are used as baselines.\nThe sparsely-gated MoE models show a superior SS capability with less speech\ndistortion, meanwhile marginally increasing the run-time computational cost.\nExperimental results using real conversation recordings are also presented,\nshowing MoE's effectiveness in an end-to-end evaluation setting.",

Radiogenomics is an\nemerging discipline that combines medical imaging and genomics features for\nmodeling patient outcomes non-invasively.

    "abstract": "In the field of medical image, deep convolutional neural networks(ConvNets)\nhave achieved great success in the classification, segmentation, and\nregistration tasks thanks to their unparalleled capacity to learn image\nfeatures. However, these tasks often require large amounts of manually\nannotated data and are labor-intensive. Therefore, it is of significant\nimportance for us to study unsupervised semantic feature learning tasks. In our\nwork, we propose to learn features in medical images by training ConvNets to\nrecognize the geometric transformation applied to images and present a simple\nself-supervised task that can easily predict the geometric transformation. We\nprecisely define a set of geometric transformations in mathematical terms and\ngeneralize this model to 3D, taking into account the distinction between\nspatial and time dimensions. We evaluated our self-supervised method on CMR\nimages of different modalities (bSSFP, T2, LGE) and achieved accuracies of\n96.4%, 97.5%, and 96.4%, respectively.

Deep learning\ntechniques created new opportunities to revolutionize staining methods by\ndigitally generating histological stains using trained neural networks,\nproviding rapid, cost-effective, and accurate alternatives to standard chemical\nstaining methods.

    "abstract": "In this article, a variation of the classical Markov-Dubins problem is\nconsidered, which deals with curvature-constrained least-cost paths in a plane\nwith prescribed initial and final configurations, different bounds for the\nsinistral and dextral curvatures, and penalties $\\mu_L$ and $\\mu_R$ for the\nsinistral and dextral turns, respectively. The addressed problem generalizes\nthe classical Markov-Dubins problem and the asymmetric sinistral/dextral\nMarkov-Dubins problem. The proposed formulation can be used to model an\nUnmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with a penalty associated with a turn due to a\nloss in altitude while turning or a UAV with different costs for the sinistral\nand dextral turns due to hardware failures or environmental conditions. Using\noptimal control theory, the main result of this paper shows that the optimal\npath belongs to a set of at most $21$ candidate paths, each comprising of at\nmost five segments. Unlike in the classical Markov-Dubins problem, the $CCC$\npath, which is a candidate path for the classical Markov-Dubins problem, is not\noptimal for the weighted Markov-Dubins problem. Moreover, the obtained list of\ncandidate paths for the weighted Markov-Dubins problem reduces to the standard\n$CSC$ and $CCC$ paths and the corresponding degenerate paths when $\\mu_L$ and\n$\\mu_R$ approach zero.",

Learning-based detection does not need to estimate channels, which\novercomes a key drawback in one-bit quantized systems. During training,\nlearning-based detection suffers at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) because\nobservations will be biased to +1 or -1 which leads to many zero-valued\nempirical likelihood functions. At low SNR, observations vary frequently in\nvalue but the high noise power makes capturing the effect of the channel\ndifficult. To address these drawbacks, we propose an adaptive\ndithering-and-learning method. During training, received values are mixed with\ndithering noise whose statistics are known to the base station, and the\ndithering noise power is updated for each antenna element depending on the\nobserved pattern of the output. We then use the refined probabilities in the\none-bit maximum likelihood detection rule.

Most previous works explore temporal redundancy by detecting\nand compressing a motion map to warp the reference frame towards the target\nframe. Yet, it failed to adequately take advantage of the historical priors in\nthe sequential reference frames. In this paper, we propose an Advanced Learned\nVideo Compression (ALVC) approach with the in-loop frame prediction module,\nwhich is able to effectively predict the target frame from the previously\ncompressed frames, \\textit{without consuming any bit-rate}. The predicted frame\ncan serve as a better reference than the previously compressed frame, and\ntherefore it benefits the compression performance. The proposed in-loop\nprediction module is a part of the end-to-end video compression and is jointly\noptimized in the whole framework. We propose the recurrent and the\nbi-directional in-loop prediction modules for compressing P-frames and\nB-frames, respectively. The experiments show the state-of-the-art performance\nof our ALVC approach in learned video compression.

Most transcript reconstruction\nmethods infer full-length transcripts from high-throughput sequencing data.\nHowever, this is a challenging task due to incomplete annotations and the\ndifferential expression of transcripts across cell-types, tissues, and\nexperimental conditions. Several recent methods circumvent these difficulties\nby considering local splicing events, but these methods lose transcript-level\nsplicing information and may conflate transcripts. We develop the first\nprobabilistic model that reconciles the transcript and local splicing\nperspectives. First, we formalize the sequence of mRNA excisions (SME)\nreconstruction problem, which aims to assemble variable-length sequences of\nmRNA excisions from RNA-sequencing data. We then present a novel hierarchical\nBayesian admixture model for the Reconstruction of Excised mRNA (BREM). BREM\ninterpolates between local splicing events and full-length transcripts and thus\nfocuses only on SMEs that have high posterior probability. We develop posterior\ninference algorithms based on Gibbs sampling and local search of independent\nsets and characterize differential SME usage using generalized linear models\nbased on converged BREM model parameters. We show that BREM achieves higher F1\nscore for reconstruction tasks and improved accuracy and sensitivity in\ndifferential splicing when compared with four state-of-the-art transcript and\nlocal splicing methods on simulated data.

The current use of Koopman operators mainly focuses on\nthe characterization of spectral properties of ergodic dynamical systems. In\nthis paper, we step forward from unforced dynamical systems to control systems\nand establish a systematic Koopman control framework. Specifically, we\nrigorously derive a differential equation system governing the dynamics of the\nKoopman operator associated with a control system, and show that the resulting\nsystem is a bilinear system evolving on an infinite-dimensional Lie group,\nwhich directly leads to a global bilinearization of control-affine systems.\nThen, by integrating techniques in geometric control theory with\ninfinite-dimensional differential geometry, this further offers a two-fold\nbenefit to controllability analysis: the characterization of controllability\nfor control-affine systems in terms of de Rham differential operators and the\nextension of the Lie algebra rank condition to infinite-dimensional systems. To\ndemonstrate the applicability, we further adopt the established framework to\ndevelop the Koopman feedback linearization technique, which, as one of the\nadvantages, waives the controllability requirement for the systems to be\nlinearized by using the classical feedback linearization technique. In\naddition, it is worth mentioning that a distinctive feature of this work is the\nmaximum utilization of the intrinsic algebraic and geometric properties of\nKoopman operators, instead of spectral methods and the ergodicity assumption of\nsystems, which further demonstrate a significant advantage of our work and a\nsubstantial difference between the presented and existing research into Koopman\noperators.",

    "abstract": "Cochlear implantation is currently the most effective treatment for patients\nwith severe deafness, but mastering cochlear implantation is extremely\nchallenging because the temporal bone has extremely complex and small\nthree-dimensional anatomical structures, and it is important to avoid damaging\nthe corresponding structures when performing surgery. The spatial location of\nthe relevant anatomical tissues within the target area needs to be determined\nusing CT prior to the procedure. Considering that the target structures are too\nsmall and complex, the time required for manual segmentation is too long, and\nit is extremely challenging to segment the temporal bone and its nearby\nanatomical structures quickly and accurately. To overcome this difficulty, we\npropose a deep learning-based algorithm, a 3D network model for automatic\nsegmentation of multi-structural targets in temporal bone CT that can\nautomatically segment the cochlea, facial nerve, auditory tubercle, vestibule\nand semicircular canal. The algorithm combines CNN and Transformer for feature\nextraction and takes advantage of spatial attention and channel attention\nmechanisms to further improve the segmentation effect, the experimental results\ncomparing with the results of various existing segmentation algorithms show\nthat the dice similarity scores, Jaccard coefficients of all targets anatomical\nstructures are significantly higher while HD95 and ASSD scores are lower,\neffectively proving that our method outperforms other advanced methods.",

The preference of a\ncountry to trade in US dollar or Chinese yuan is determined by two\nmultiplicative factors: the relative weight of trade volume exchanged by the\ncountry with its direct trade partners, and the relative weight of its trade\npartners in the global international trade. The performed analysis, based on\nIsing spin interactions on the world trade network, shows that, from 2010 to\npresent, a transition took place, and the majority of the world countries would\nhave now a preference to trade in Chinese yuan if one only consider the world\ntrade network structure.",

However, the main-stream\narchitecture for Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV) is convolutional Neural\nNetworks, and there is still much room for research on the Conformer based ASV.\nIn this paper, firstly, we modify the Conformer architecture from ASR to ASV\nwith very minor changes. Length-Scaled Attention (LSA) method and\nSharpness-Aware Minimizationis (SAM) are adopted to improve model\ngeneralization. Experiments conducted on VoxCeleb and CN-Celeb show that our\nConformer based ASV achieves competitive performance compared with the popular\nECAPA-TDNN. Secondly, inspired by the transfer learning strategy, ASV Conformer\nis natural to be initialized from the pretrained ASR model. Via parameter\ntransferring, self-attention mechanism could better focus on the relationship\nbetween sequence features, brings about 11% relative improvement in EER on test\nset of VoxCeleb and CN-Celeb, which reveals the potential of Conformer to unify\nASV and ASR task.

In practice, the number of\ntasks available for meta-learning is often small. Yet, most of the existing\napproaches rely on an abundance of meta-training tasks, making them prone to\noverfitting. How to regularize the meta-learner to ensure generalization to\nunseen tasks, is a central question in the literature. We provide a theoretical\nanalysis using the PAC-Bayesian framework and derive the first bound for\nmeta-learners with unbounded loss functions. Crucially, our bounds allow us to\nderive the PAC-optimal hyper-posterior (PACOH) - the closed-form-solution of\nthe PAC-Bayesian meta-learning problem, thereby avoiding the reliance on nested\noptimization, giving rise to an optimization problem amenable to standard\nvariational methods that scale well. Our experiments show that, when\ninstantiating the PACOH with Gaussian processes and Bayesian Neural Networks as\nbase learners, the resulting methods are more scalable, and yield\nstate-of-the-art performance, both in terms of predictive accuracy and the\nquality of uncertainty estimates.

The algorithm here proposed overcomes these drawbacks as\nit is an extension of Chow and Liu's algorithm. Once, the probabilistic\nstructure of a High Dimensional Graphical Model is determined via the said\nalgorithm, the best path-step, including variables with the most\nexplanatory/predictive power for a variable of interest, is determined via the\ncomputation of the entropy coefficient of determination. The latter, being\nbased on the notion of (symmetric) Kullback-Leibler divergence, turns out to be\nclosely connected to the mutual information of the involved variables.

Here, a surrogate (approximate) model of such an auditory nerve fiber\nmodel was developed using machine learning methods, to perform simulations more\nefficiently. Several machine learning models were compared, of which a\nConvolutional Neural Network showed the best performance. In fact, the\nConvolutional Neural Network was able to emulate the behavior of the auditory\nnerve fiber model with extremely high similarity ($R^2 > 0.99$), tested under a\nwide range of experimental conditions, whilst reducing the simulation time by\nfive orders of magnitude. In addition, we introduce a method for randomly\ngenerating charge-balanced waveforms using hyperplane projection. In the second\npart of this paper, the Convolutional Neural Network surrogate model was used\nby an Evolutionary Algorithm to optimize the shape of the stimulus waveform in\nterms energy efficiency. The resulting waveforms resemble a positive\nGaussian-like peak, preceded by an elongated negative phase. When comparing the\nenergy of the waveforms generated by the Evolutionary Algorithm with the\ncommonly used square wave, energy decreases of 8% - 45% were observed for\ndifferent pulse durations. These results were validated with the original\nauditory nerve fiber model, which demonstrates that our proposed surrogate\nmodel can be used as its accurate and efficient replacement.",

    "abstract": "The white-matter (micro-)structural architecture of the brain promotes\nsynchrony among neuronal populations, giving rise to richly patterned\nfunctional connections. A fundamental problem for systems neuroscience is\ndetermining the best way to relate structural and functional networks\nquantified by diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state functional MRI. As one\nof the state-of-the-art approaches for network analysis, graph convolutional\nnetworks (GCN) have been separately used to analyze functional and structural\nnetworks, but have not been applied to explore inter-network relationships. In\nthis work, we propose to couple the two networks of an individual by adding\ninter-network edges between corresponding brain regions, so that the joint\nstructure-function graph can be directly analyzed by a single GCN. The weights\nof inter-network edges are learnable, reflecting non-uniform structure-function\ncoupling strength across the brain. We apply our Joint-GCN to predict age and\nsex of 662 participants from the public dataset of the National Consortium on\nAlcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) based on their functional\nand micro-structural white-matter networks. Our results support that the\nproposed Joint-GCN outperforms existing multi-modal graph learning approaches\nfor analyzing structural and functional networks.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for text-independent speaker\nidentification system: Multi-Label Training (MLT). Instead of the commonly used\none-to-one correspondence between the speech and the speaker label, we divide\nall the speeches of each speaker into several subgroups, with each subgroup\nassigned a different set of labels. During the identification process, a\nspecific speaker is identified as long as the predicted label is the same as\none of his/her corresponding labels. We found that this method can force the\nmodel to distinguish the data more accurately, and somehow takes advantages of\nensemble learning, while avoiding the significant increase of computation and\nstorage burden. In the experiments, we found that not only in clean conditions,\nbut also in noisy conditions with speech enhancement, Multi-Label Training can\nstill achieve better identification performance than commom methods. It should\nbe noted that the proposed strategy can be easily applied to almost all current\ntext-independent speaker identification models to achieve further improvements.",

    "abstract": "Independent component analysis (ICA) of multi-subject functional magnetic\nresonance imaging (fMRI) data has proven useful in providing a fully\nmultivariate summary that can be used for multiple purposes. ICA can identify\npatterns that can discriminate between healthy controls (HC) and patients with\nvarious mental disorders such as schizophrenia (Sz). Temporal functional\nnetwork connectivity (tFNC) obtained from ICA can effectively explain the\ninteractions between brain networks. On the other hand, dictionary learning\n(DL) enables the discovery of hidden information in data using learnable basis\nsignals through the use of sparsity. In this paper, we present a new method\nthat leverages ICA and DL for the identification of directly interpretable\npatterns to discriminate between the HC and Sz groups. We use multi-subject\nresting-state fMRI data from $358$ subjects and form subject-specific tFNC\nfeature vectors from ICA results. Then, we learn sparse representations of the\ntFNCs and introduce a new set of sparse features as well as new interpretable\npatterns from the learned atoms. Our experimental results show that the new\nrepresentation not only leads to effective classification between HC and Sz\ngroups using sparse features, but can also identify new interpretable patterns\nfrom the learned atoms that can help understand the complexities of mental\ndiseases such as schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Advances in deep neural network (DNN) architectures have enabled new\nprediction techniques for stock market data. Unlike other multivariate\ntime-series data, stock markets show two unique characteristics: (i)\n\\emph{multi-order dynamics}, as stock prices are affected by strong\nnon-pairwise correlations (e.g., within the same industry); and (ii)\n\\emph{internal dynamics}, as each individual stock shows some particular\nbehaviour. Recent DNN-based methods capture multi-order dynamics using\nhypergraphs, but rely on the Fourier basis in the convolution, which is both\ninefficient and ineffective. In addition, they largely ignore internal dynamics\nby adopting the same model for each stock, which implies a severe information\nloss.\nIn this paper, we propose a framework for stock movement prediction to\novercome the above issues. Specifically, the framework includes temporal\ngenerative filters that implement a memory-based mechanism onto an LSTM network\nin an attempt to learn individual patterns per stock. Moreover, we employ\nhypergraph attentions to capture the non-pairwise correlations. Here, using the\nwavelet basis instead of the Fourier basis, enables us to simplify the message\npassing and focus on the localized convolution. Experiments with US market data\nover six years show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in\nterms of profit and stability.

It could be phrased in loose terms as \"If a person has\nthe ability to verify a proof and a disproof to a problem, does this person\nknow a solution to that problem?\". When talking about people, one can of course\nsee that the question can't be answered -- it depends on the knowledge the\nspecific person has on this problem. Our main goal will be to extend this\nobservation to formal models of set theory $ZF$: by adding \"knowledge\" to a\nmodel of a specific problem $L$ in $NP\\cap co-NP$, we can create a model of\n$ZF$ in which the problem $L$ is in $P$ in that model. In this paper, we'll\ndefine the exact terms and show:\n- a mechanism, that is similar -- but somewhat different -- to forcing, which\nadds a set to an existing $ZF$ model.\n- how to use this mechanism to add \"knowledge\" to a $ZF$ model.\n- how such a \"knowledge enriched\" model can solve a problem and make it\npolynomial time decidable.\nAs a result -- we show that under some mild consistency assumptions and one\nunnatural assumption, the statement that a given definable language in $NP\\cap\nco-NP$ is also in $P$, is consistent with $ZF$ axioms. This article won't solve\nthe $P$ vs $NP\\cap co-NP$ question, but its main result brings us one step\ncloser to deciding that question. Moreover, the main result will depend on an\n\"unnatural\" peculation assumption (given in the paper) which hopefully will be\nresolved in further works.",

    "abstract": "The development of data-driven heart sound classification models has been an\nactive area of research in recent years. To develop such data-driven models in\nthe first place, heart sound signals need to be captured using a signal\nacquisition device. However, it is almost impossible to capture noise-free\nheart sound signals due to the presence of internal and external noises in most\nsituations. Such noises and degradations in heart sound signals can potentially\nreduce the accuracy of data-driven classification models. Although different\ntechniques have been proposed in the literature to address the noise issue, how\nand to what extent different noise and degradations in heart sound signals\nimpact the accuracy of data-driven classification models remains unexplored. To\nanswer this question, we produced a synthetic heart sound dataset including\nnormal and abnormal heart sounds contaminated with a large variety of noise and\ndegradations. We used this dataset to investigate the impact of noise and\ndegradation in heart sound recordings on the performance of different\nclassification models. The results show different noises and degradations\naffect the performance of heart sound classification models to a different\nextent; some are more problematic for classification models, and others are\nless destructive. Comparing the findings of this study with the results of a\nsurvey we previously carried out with a group of clinicians shows noise and\ndegradations that are more detrimental to classification models are also more\ndisruptive to accurate auscultation. The findings of this study can be\nleveraged to develop targeted heart sound quality enhancement approaches -\nwhich adapt the type and aggressiveness of quality enhancement based on the\ncharacteristics of noise and degradation in heart sound signals.",

Adaptive algorithms utilize local\nindicators to dynamically identify regions and assign spatial operators of\nvarying accuracy in the computational domain. This work identifies requisite\nproperties of adaptivity drivers and develops two methods, a feature-based\nmethod guided by gradients of local field, and another utilizing the divergence\nerror often found in numerical solution to the time-domain Maxwell's equations.\nResults for canonical testcases of electromagnetic scattering are presented,\nhighlighting key characteristics of both methods, and their computational\nperformance.",

    "abstract": "With the advances in deep learning, speech enhancement systems benefited from\nlarge neural network architectures and achieved state-of-the-art quality.\nHowever, speaker-agnostic methods are not always desirable, both in terms of\nquality and their complexity, when they are to be used in a\nresource-constrained environment. One promising way is personalized speech\nenhancement (PSE), which is a smaller and easier speech enhancement problem for\nsmall models to solve, because it focuses on a particular test-time user. To\nachieve the personalization goal, while dealing with the typical lack of\npersonal data, we investigate the effect of data augmentation based on neural\nspeech synthesis (NSS). In the proposed method, we show that the quality of the\nNSS system's synthetic data matters, and if they are good enough the augmented\ndataset can be used to improve the PSE system that outperforms the\nspeaker-agnostic baseline. The proposed PSE systems show significant complexity\nreduction while preserving the enhancement quality.",

    "abstract": "The human brain is a complex network comprised of functionally and\nanatomically interconnected brain regions. A growing number of studies have\nsuggested that empirical estimates of brain networks may be useful for\ndiscovery of biomarkers of disease and cognitive state. A prerequisite for\nrealizing this aim, however, is that brain networks also serve as reliable\nmarkers of an individual. Here, using Human Connectome Project data, we build\nupon recent studies examining brain-based fingerprints of individual subjects\nand cognitive states based on cognitively-demanding tasks that assess, for\nexample, working memory, theory of mind, and motor function. Our approach\nachieves accuracy of up to 99\\% for both identification of the subject of an\nfMRI scan, and for classification of the cognitive state of a previously-unseen\nsubject in a scan. More broadly, we explore the accuracy and reliability of\nfive different machine learning techniques on subject fingerprinting and\ncognitive state decoding objectives, using functional connectivity data from\nfMRI scans of a high number of subjects (865) across a number of cognitive\nstates (8). These results represent an advance on existing techniques for\nfunctional connectivity-based brain fingerprinting and state decoding.\nAdditionally, 16 different pre-processing pipelines are compared in order to\ncharacterize the effects of different aspects of the production of functional\nconnectomes (FCs) on the accuracy of subject and task classification, and to\nidentify possible confounds.",

    "abstract": "The paper proposes a novel adaptive search space decomposition method and a\nnovel gradient-free optimization-based formulation for the pre- and\npost-buckling analyses of space truss structures. Space trusses are often\nemployed in structural engineering to build large steel constructions, such as\nbridges and domes, whose structural response is characterized by large\ndisplacements. Therefore, these structures are vulnerable to progressive\ncollapses due to local or global buckling effects, leading to sudden failures.\nThe method proposed in this paper allows the analysis of the load-equilibrium\npath of truss structures to permanent and variable loading, including stable\nand unstable equilibrium stages and explicitly considering geometric\nnonlinearities. The goal of this work is to determine these equilibrium stages\nvia optimization of the Lagrangian kinematic parameters of the system,\ndetermining the global equilibrium. However, this optimization problem is\nnon-trivial due to the undefined parameter domain and the sensitivity and\ninteraction among the Lagrangian parameters. Therefore, we propose formulating\nthis problem as a nonlinear, multimodal, unconstrained, continuous optimization\nproblem and develop a novel adaptive search space decomposition method, which\nprogressively and adaptively re-defines the search domain (hypersphere) to\nevaluate the equilibrium of the system using a gradient-free optimization\nalgorithm. We tackle three benchmark problems and evaluate a medium-sized test\nrepresenting a real structural problem in this paper. The results are compared\nto those available in the literature regarding displacement-load curves and\ndeformed configurations. The accuracy and robustness of the adopted methodology\nshow a high potential of gradient-free algorithms in analyzing space truss\nstructures.",

One of the main limitations of thermography is the\ninherent limit to the resolution of the internal structures of any specimen due\nto the diffusive nature of heat conduction. Overcoming this limit is the goal\nof thermographic super resolution methods. In this work, we present a method\nusing two-dimensional pixel pattern based active photothermal laser heating in\nconjunction with subsequent numerical reconstruction to achieve a\nhigh-resolution reconstruction of internal defect structures.
