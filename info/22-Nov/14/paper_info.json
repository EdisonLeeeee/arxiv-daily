    "title": "Optimizing the Age of Information in Mixed-Critical Wireless  Communication Networks",
    "abstract": "Beyond fifth generation wireless communication networks (B5G) are applied in\nmany use-cases, such as industrial control systems, smart public transport, and\npower grids. Those applications require innovative techniques for timely\ntransmission and increased wireless network capacities. Hence, this paper\nproposes optimizing the data freshness measured by the age of information (AoI)\nin dense internet of things (IoT) sensor-actuator networks. Given different\npriorities of data-streams, i.e., different sensitivities to outdated\ninformation, mixed-criticality is introduced by analyzing different functions\nof the age, i.e., we consider linear and exponential aging functions. An\nintricate non-convex optimization problem managing the physical transmission\ntime and packet outage probability is derived. Such problem is tackled using\nstochastic reformulations, successive convex approximations, and fractional\nprogramming, resulting in an efficient iterative algorithm for AoI\noptimization. Simulation results validate the proposed scheme's performance in\nterms of AoI, mixed-criticality, and scalability. The proposed non-orthogonal\ntransmission is shown to outperform an orthogonal access scheme in various\ndeployment cases. Results emphasize the potential gains for dense B5G empowered\nIoT networks in minimizing the AoI.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the relationship between H.264 video compression and the\nperformance of an object detection network (YOLOv5). We curated a set of 50\nsurveillance videos and annotated targets of interest (people, bikes, and\nvehicles). Videos were encoded at 5 quality levels using Constant Rate Factor\n(CRF) values in the set {22,32,37,42,47}. YOLOv5 was applied to compressed\nvideos and detection performance was analyzed at each CRF level. Test results\nindicate that the detection performance is generally robust to moderate levels\nof compression; using a CRF value of 37 instead of 22 leads to significantly\nreduced bitrates/file sizes without adversely affecting detection performance.\nHowever, detection performance degrades appreciably at higher compression\nlevels, especially in complex scenes with poor lighting and fast-moving\ntargets. Finally, retraining YOLOv5 on compressed imagery gives up to a 1%\nimprovement in F1 score when applied to highly compressed footage.",

    "abstract": "While many dashboards for visualizing COVID-19 data exist, most separate\ngeospatial and temporal data into discrete visualizations or tables. Further,\nthe common use of choropleth maps or space-filling map overlays supports only a\nsingle geospatial variable at once, making it difficult to compare the temporal\nand geospatial trends of multiple, potentially interacting variables, such as\nactive cases, deaths, and vaccinations. We present CoronaViz, a COVID-19\nvisualization system that conveys multilayer, spatiotemporal data in a single,\ninteractive display. CoronaViz encodes variables with concentric, hollow\ncircles, termed geocircles, allowing multiple variables via color encoding and\navoiding occlusion problems. The radii of geocircles relate to the values of\nthe variables they represent via the psychophysically determined Flannery\nformula. The time dimension of spatiotemporal variables is encoded with\nsequential rendering. Animation controls allow the user to seek through time\nmanually or to view the pandemic unfolding in accelerated time. An adjustable\ntime window allows aggregation at any granularity, from single days to\ncumulative values for the entire available range. In addition to describing the\nCoronaViz system, we report findings from a user study comparing CoronaViz with\nmulti-view dashboards from the New York Times and Johns Hopkins University.\nWhile participants preferred using the latter two dashboards to perform queries\nwith only a geospatial component or only a temporal component, participants\nuniformly preferred CoronaViz for queries with both spatial and temporal\ncomponents, highlighting the utility of a unified spatiotemporal encoding.\nCoronaViz is open-source and freely available at this http URL",

    "abstract": "Electronics repair and service providers offer a range of services to\ncomputing device owners across North America -- from software installation to\nhardware repair. Device owners obtain these services and leave their device\nalong with their access credentials at the mercy of technicians, which leads to\nprivacy concerns for owners' personal data. We conduct a comprehensive\nfour-part study to measure the state of privacy in the electronics repair\nindustry. First, through a field study with 18 service providers, we uncover\nthat most service providers do not have any privacy policy or controls to\nsafeguard device owners' personal data from snooping by technicians. Second, we\ndrop rigged devices for repair at 16 service providers and collect data on\nwidespread privacy violations by technicians, including snooping on personal\ndata, copying data off the device, and removing tracks of snooping activities.\nThird, we conduct an online survey (n=112) to collect data on customers'\nexperiences when getting devices repaired. Fourth, we invite a subset of survey\nrespondents (n=30) for semi-structured interviews to establish a deeper\nunderstanding of their experiences and identify potential solutions to curtail\nprivacy violations by technicians. We apply our findings to discuss possible\ncontrols and actions different stakeholders and regulatory agencies should take\nto improve the state of privacy in the repair industry.",

    "abstract": "To understand and improve DRAM performance, reliability, security and energy\nefficiency, prior works study characteristics of commodity DRAM chips.\nUnfortunately, state-of-the-art open source infrastructures capable of\nconducting such studies are obsolete, poorly supported, or difficult to use, or\ntheir inflexibility limit the types of studies they can conduct.\nWe propose DRAM Bender, a new FPGA-based infrastructure that enables\nexperimental studies on state-of-the-art DRAM chips. DRAM Bender offers three\nkey features at the same time. First, DRAM Bender enables directly interfacing\nwith a DRAM chip through its low-level interface. This allows users to issue\nDRAM commands in arbitrary order and with finer-grained time intervals compared\nto other open source infrastructures. Second, DRAM Bender exposes easy-to-use\nC++ and Python programming interfaces, allowing users to quickly and easily\ndevelop different types of DRAM experiments. Third, DRAM Bender is easily\nextensible. The modular design of DRAM Bender allows extending it to (i)\nsupport existing and emerging DRAM interfaces, and (ii) run on new commercial\nor custom FPGA boards with little effort.\nTo demonstrate that DRAM Bender is a versatile infrastructure, we conduct\nthree case studies, two of which lead to new observations about the DRAM\nRowHammer vulnerability. In particular, we show that data patterns supported by\nDRAM Bender uncovers a larger set of bit-flips on a victim row compared to the\ndata patterns commonly used by prior work. We demonstrate the extensibility of\nDRAM Bender by implementing it on five different FPGAs with DDR4 and DDR3\nsupport.

While some work has looked into how\nstate-of-the-art PLMs address this need, they have been limited to only\nevaluating lexical equality of single- or multi-word answers and do not address\nconsistency of generative text sequences. In order to understand consistency of\nPLMs under text generation settings, we develop a measure of semantic\nconsistency that allows the comparison of open-ended text outputs. We implement\nseveral versions of this consistency metric to evaluate the performance of a\nnumber of PLMs on paraphrased versions of questions in the TruthfulQA dataset,\nwe find that our proposed metrics are considerably more consistent than\ntraditional metrics embodying lexical consistency, and also correlate with\nhuman evaluation of output consistency to a higher degree.",

Layered\nstreaming architectures integrate pull-based read and push-based write RPC\nmechanisms implemented by stream ingestion/storage systems. In addition, stream\nprocessing engines expose source/sink interfaces, allowing them to decouple\nthese systems easily. However, open-source streaming engines leverage workflow\nsources implemented through a pull-based approach, continuously issuing read\nRPCs towards the stream ingestion/storage, effectively competing with write\nRPCs. This paper proposes a unified streaming architecture that leverages\npush-based and/or pull-based source implementations for integrating\ningestion/storage and processing engines that can reduce processing latency and\nincrease system read and write throughput while making room for higher\ningestion. We implement a novel push-based streaming source by replacing\ncontinuous pull-based RPCs with one single RPC and shared memory (storage and\nprocessing handle streaming data through pointers to shared objects).

As a geometric optimization problem of natural practical and\ntheoretical importance, the LMP generalizes and combines several notoriously\ndifficult problems, including minimum covering by disks, the Traveling Salesman\nProblem with neighborhoods (TSPN), and the Art Gallery Problem (AGP).\nIn this paper, we conduct the first study of the Lawn Mowing Problem with a\nfocus on practical computation of near-optimal solutions. We provide new\ntheoretical insights: Optimal solutions are polygonal paths with a bounded\nnumber of vertices, allowing a restriction to straight-line solutions; on the\nother hand, there can be relatively simple instances for which optimal\nsolutions require a large class of irrational coordinates. On the practical\nside, we present a primal-dual approach with provable convergence properties\nbased on solving a special case of the TSPN restricted to witness sets. In each\niteration, this establishes both a valid solution and a valid lower bound, and\nthereby a bound on the remaining optimality gap. As we demonstrate in an\nextensive computational study, this allows us to achieve provably optimal and\nnear-optimal solutions for a large spectrum of benchmark instances with up to\n2000 vertices.",

    "abstract": "Visual commonsense understanding requires Vision Language (VL) models to not\nonly understand image and text but also cross-reference in-between to fully\nintegrate and achieve comprehension of the visual scene described. Recently,\nvarious approaches have been developed and have achieved high performance on\nvisual commonsense benchmarks. However, it is unclear whether the models really\nunderstand the visual scene and underlying commonsense knowledge due to limited\nevaluation data resources. To provide an in-depth analysis, we present a\nMultimodal Evaluation (ME) pipeline to automatically generate question-answer\npairs to test models' understanding of the visual scene, text, and related\nknowledge. We then take a step further to show that training with the ME data\nboosts the model's performance in standard VCR evaluation. Lastly, our in-depth\nanalysis and comparison reveal interesting findings: (1) semantically low-level\ninformation can assist the learning of high-level information but not the\nopposite; (2) visual information is generally under utilization compared with\ntext.",

    "abstract": "Aggregation in relational databases is accomplished through hashing and\nsorting interval data, which is computationally expensive and scales poorly as\nthe data volumes grow.\nIn this paper, we show how quantitative interval and time-series data in\nrelational attributes can be represented using delta summary values rather than\nabsolute values. The need for sorting to determine the row corresponding to\nsome maximum timestamp is negated, reducing the time complexity from at least\nO(n log(n)) towards O(n) and improving query execution times. We illustrate\nthis new method in the relational algebra, present the implementation\nalgorithmically, and test an implementation in two leading RDBMS products\nagainst the use of normal equivalents.\nWe found this delta summation technique to be most effective for use cases\nwith additive, numerical data upon which it is necessary to frequently obtain\nthe latest values, and where the row cardinalities are in the order of 10^5.\nOur experiments found the proposed new delta summation technique could execute\nfaster than the equivalent standard selection method by up to 22.4%, reducing\nthe overall query cost in some circumstances by up to 24.0%, reducing I/O load\nby up to 60.6%, but with increased query costs for write operations, an\nincrease in CPU time and memory allocation, uncertain performance with very low\nor very high cardinalities and inconsistent results across different RDBMS\nplatforms.",

    "abstract": "In a space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN), managing resources for the\ngrowing number of highly-dynamic and heterogeneous radios is a challenging\ntask. Symbiotic communication (SC) is a novel paradigm, which leverages the\nanalogy of the natural ecosystem in biology to create a radio ecosystem in\nwireless networks that achieves cooperative service exchange and resource\nsharing, i.e., service/resource trading, among numerous radios. As a result,\nthe potential of symbiotic communication can be exploited to enhance resource\nmanagement in SAGIN. Despite the fact that different radio resource bottlenecks\ncan complement each other via symbiotic relationships, unreliable information\nsharing among heterogeneous radios and multi-dimensional resources managing\nunder diverse service requests impose critical challenges on trusted trading\nand intelligent decision-making. In this article, we propose a secure and smart\nsymbiotic SAGIN (S^4) framework by using blockchain for ensuring trusted\ntrading among heterogeneous radios and machine learning (ML) for guiding\ncomplex service/resource trading. A case study demonstrates that our proposed\nS^4 framework provides better service with rational resource management when\ncompared with existing schemes.

    "abstract": "Irregular applications comprise an increasingly important workload domain for\nmany fields, including bioinformatics, chemistry, physics, social sciences and\nmachine learning. Therefore, achieving high performance and energy efficiency\nin the execution of emerging irregular applications is of vital importance.\nThis dissertation studies the root causes of inefficiency of irregular\napplications in modern computing systems, and fundamentally addresses such\ninefficiencies, by proposing low-overhead synchronization techniques among\nparallel threads in cooperation with well-crafted data access policies.\nWe make four major contributions to accelerating irregular applications in\ndifferent contexts including CPU and Near-Data-Processing (NDP) (or\nProcessing-In-Memory (PIM)) systems. First, we design ColorTM, a novel parallel\ngraph coloring algorithm for CPU systems that trades off using synchronization\nwith lower data access costs. Second, we propose SmartPQ, an adaptive priority\nqueue that achieves high performance under all various contention scenarios in\nNon-Uniform Memory Access CPU systems. Third, we introduce SynCron, the first\npractical hardware synchronization mechanism tailored for NDP systems. Fourth,\nwe design SparseP, the first library for high-performance Sparse Matrix Vector\nMultiplication on real PIM systems.\nWe demonstrate that the execution of irregular applications in CPU and\nNDP/PIM architectures can be significantly accelerated by co-designing\nlightweight synchronization approaches along with well-crafted data access\npolicies. This dissertation bridges the gap between processor-centric CPU\nsystems and memory-centric PIM systems in the critically-important area of\nirregular applications.

    "abstract": "Labeling a module defective or non-defective is an expensive task. Hence,\nthere are often limits on how much-labeled data is available for training.\nSemi-supervised classifiers use far fewer labels for training models, but there\nare numerous semi-supervised methods, including self-labeling, co-training,\nmaximal-margin, and graph-based methods, to name a few. Only a handful of these\nmethods have been tested in SE for (e.g.) predicting defects and even that,\nthose tests have been on just a handful of projects. This paper takes a wide\nrange of 55 semi-supervised learners and applies these to over 714 projects. We\nfind that semi-supervised \"co-training methods\" work significantly better than\nother approaches. However, co-training needs to be used with caution since the\nspecific choice of co-training methods needs to be carefully selected based on\na user's specific goals. Also, we warn that a commonly-used co-training method\n(\"multi-view\"-- where different learners get different sets of columns) does\nnot improve predictions (while adding too much to the run time costs 11 hours\nvs. 1.8 hours). Those cautions stated, we find using these \"co-trainers,\" we\ncan label just 2.5% of data, then make predictions that are competitive to\nthose using 100% of the data. It is an open question worthy of future work to\ntest if these reductions can be seen in other areas of software analytics.\nAll the codes used and datasets analyzed during the current study are\navailable in the https://GitHub.com/Suvodeep90/Semi_Supervised_Methods.",

This paper presents algorithms to compute\nbounds on the SSV for the case of repeated complex full blocks. This specific\nclass of uncertainty is relevant for the input output analysis of many\nconvective systems, such as fluid flows. Specifically, we present a power\niteration to compute a lower bound on SSV for the case of repeated complex full\nblocks. This generalizes existing power iterations for repeated complex scalar\nand non-repeated complex full blocks. The upper bound can be formulated as a\nsemi-definite program (SDP), which we solve using a standard interior-point\nmethod to compute optimal scaling matrices associated with the repeated full\nblocks. Our implementation of the method only requires gradient information,\nwhich improves the computational efficiency of the method.

    "abstract": "Physically based rendering of complex scenes can be prohibitively costly with\na potentially unbounded and uneven distribution of complexity across the\nrendered image. The goal of an ideal level of detail (LoD) method is to make\nrendering costs independent of the 3D scene complexity, while preserving the\nappearance of the scene. However, current prefiltering LoD methods are limited\nin the appearances they can support due to their reliance of approximate models\nand other heuristics. We propose the first comprehensive multi-scale LoD\nframework for prefiltering 3D environments with complex geometry and materials\n(e.g., the Disney BRDF), while maintaining the appearance with respect to the\nray-traced reference. Using a multi-scale hierarchy of the scene, we perform a\ndata-driven prefiltering step to obtain an appearance phase function and\ndirectional coverage mask at each scale. At the heart of our approach is a\nnovel neural representation that encodes this information into a compact latent\nform that is easy to decode inside a physically based renderer. Once a scene is\nbaked out, our method requires no original geometry, materials, or textures at\nrender time. We demonstrate that our approach compares favorably to\nstate-of-the-art prefiltering methods and achieves considerable savings in\nmemory for complex scenes.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, there is a growing interest in the field of magnetic particle\nspectroscopy (MPS)-based bioassays. MPS monitors the dynamic magnetic response\nof surface-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) upon excitation by an\nalternating magnetic field (AMF) to detect various target analytes. This\ntechnology has flourished in the past decade due to its low cost, low\nbackground magnetic noise interference from biomatrix, and fast response time.\nA large number of MPS variants have been reported by different groups around\nthe world, with applications ranging from disease diagnosis to foodborne\npathogen detection, and virus detection. However, there is an urgent need for\nguidance on how to optimize the sensitivity of MPS detection by choosing\ndifferent types of MNPs, AMF modalities, and MPS assay strategies (i.e.,\nvolume- and surface-based assays). In this work, we systematically study the\neffect of AMF frequencies and amplitudes on the responses of single- and\nmulti-core MNPs under two extreme conditions, namely, the bound and unbound\nstates. Our results show that some modalities such as dual-frequency MPS\nutilizing multicore MNPs are more suitable for surface-based bioassay\napplications, whereas, single-frequency MPS systems using single- or multi-core\nMNPs are better suited for volumetric bioassay applications. Furthermore, the\nbioassay sensitivities for these modalities can be further improved by careful\nselection of AMF frequencies and amplitudes.",

Acoustic based gait detection is\na promising approach to collect gait data of older adults passively and\nnon-intrusively. However, there has been limited work in developing acoustic\nbased gait detectors that can operate in noisy polyphonic acoustic scenes of\nhomes and care homes. We attribute this to the lack of good quality gait\ndatasets from the real-world to train a gait detector on. In this paper, we put\nforward a novel machine learning based filter which can triage gait audio\nsamples suitable for training machine learning models for gait detection. The\nfilter achieves this by eliminating noisy samples at an f(1) score of 0.85 and\nprioritising gait samples with distinct spectral features and minimal noise. To\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the filter, we train and evaluate a deep\nlearning model on gait datasets collected from older adults with and without\napplying the filter. The model registers an increase of 25 points in its f(1)\nscore on unseen real-word gait data when trained with the filtered gait\nsamples.

    "abstract": "As an efficient way to integrate multiple distributed energy resources and\nthe user side, a microgrid is mainly faced with the problems of small-scale\nvolatility, uncertainty, intermittency and demand-side uncertainty of DERs. The\ntraditional microgrid has a single form and cannot meet the flexible energy\ndispatch between the complex demand side and the microgrid. In response to this\nproblem, the overall environment of wind power, thermostatically controlled\nloads, energy storage systems, price-responsive loads and the main grid is\nproposed. Secondly, the centralized control of the microgrid operation is\nconvenient for the control of the reactive power and voltage of the distributed\npower supply and the adjustment of the grid frequency. However, there is a\nproblem in that the flexible loads aggregate and generate peaks during the\nelectricity price valley. The existing research takes into account the power\nconstraints of the microgrid and fails to ensure a sufficient supply of\nelectric energy for a single flexible load. This paper considers the response\npriority of each unit component of TCLs and ESSs on the basis of the overall\nenvironment operation of the microgrid so as to ensure the power supply of the\nflexible load of the microgrid and save the power input cost to the greatest\nextent. Finally, the simulation optimization of the environment can be\nexpressed as a Markov decision process process. It combines two stages of\noffline and online operations in the training process. The addition of multiple\nthreads with the lack of historical data learning leads to low learning\nefficiency. The asynchronous advantage actor-critic with the experience replay\npool memory library is added to solve the data correlation and nonstatic\ndistribution problems during training.",

    "abstract": "In neural architecture search (NAS) methods based on latent space\noptimization (LSO), a deep generative model is trained to embed discrete neural\narchitectures into a continuous latent space. In this case, different\noptimization algorithms that operate in the continuous space can be implemented\nto search neural architectures. However, the optimization of latent variables\nis challenging for gradient-based LSO since the mapping from the latent space\nto the architecture performance is generally non-convex. To tackle this\nproblem, this paper develops a convexity regularized latent space optimization\n(CR-LSO) method, which aims to regularize the learning process of latent space\nin order to obtain a convex architecture performance mapping. Specifically,\nCR-LSO trains a graph variational autoencoder (G-VAE) to learn the continuous\nrepresentations of discrete architectures. Simultaneously, the learning process\nof latent space is regularized by the guaranteed convexity of input convex\nneural networks (ICNNs). In this way, the G-VAE is forced to learn a convex\nmapping from the architecture representation to the architecture performance.\nHereafter, the CR-LSO approximates the performance mapping using the ICNN and\nleverages the estimated gradient to optimize neural architecture\nrepresentations. Experimental results on three popular NAS benchmarks show that\nCR-LSO achieves competitive evaluation results in terms of both computational\ncomplexity and architecture performance.",

To solve this problem, we would like to simultaneously\ngenerate automatic speech recognition (ASR) and ST predictions such that each\nsource language word is explicitly mapped to a target language word. A major\nchallenge arises from the fact that translation is a non-monotonic sequence\ntransduction task due to word ordering differences between languages -- this\nclashes with the monotonic nature of ASR. Therefore, we propose to generate ST\ntokens out-of-order while remembering how to re-order them later. We achieve\nthis by predicting a sequence of tuples consisting of a source word, the\ncorresponding target words, and post-editing operations dictating the correct\ninsertion points for the target word. We examine two variants of such operation\nsequences which enable generation of monotonic transcriptions and non-monotonic\ntranslations from the same speech input simultaneously. We apply our approach\nto offline and real-time streaming models, demonstrating that we can provide\nexplainable translations without sacrificing quality or latency. In fact, the\ndelayed re-ordering ability of our approach improves performance during\nstreaming.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we conduct systematic measurement studies to show that the\nhigh memory bandwidth consumption of modern distributed applications can lead\nto a significant drop of network throughput and a large increase of tail\nlatency in high-speed RDMA networks.We identify its root cause as the high\ncontention of memory bandwidth between application processes and network\nprocesses. This contention leads to frequent packet drops at the NIC of\nreceiving hosts, which triggers the congestion control mechanism of the network\nand eventually results in network performance degradation.\nTo tackle this problem, we make a key observation that given the distributed\nstorage service, the vast majority of data it receives from the network will be\neventually written to high-speed storage media (e.g., SSD) by CPU. As such, we\npropose to bypass host memory when processing received data to completely\ncircumvent this performance bottleneck. In particular, we design Lamda, a novel\nreceiver cache processing system that consumes a small amount of CPU cache to\nprocess received data from the network at line rate. We implement a prototype\nof Lamda and evaluate its performance extensively in a Clos-based testbed.\nResults show that for distributed storage applications, Lamda improves network\nthroughput by 4.7% with zero memory bandwidth consumption on storage nodes, and\nimproves network throughput by up 17% and 45% for large block size and small\nsize under the memory bandwidth pressure, respectively. Lamda can also be\napplied to latency-sensitive HPC applications, which reduces their\ncommunication latency by 35.1%.",

We motivate the use of semi-supervised learning considering the\nfact that process quality variables are not collected at the same frequency as\nother process variables leading to many unlabelled records in operational\ndatasets. These unlabelled records are not possible to use for training quality\nvariable predictions based on supervised learning methods. Use of VAEs for\nunsupervised learning is well established and recently they were used for\nregression applications based on variational inference procedures. We extend\nthis approach of supervised VAEs for regression (SVAER) to make it learn from\nunlabelled data leading to semi-supervised VAEs for regression (SSVAER), then\nwe make further modifications to their architecture using additional\nregularization components to make SSVAER well suited for learning from both\nlabelled and unlabelled process data. The probabilistic regressor resulting\nfrom the variational approach makes it possible to estimate the variance of the\npredictions simultaneously, which provides an uncertainty quantification along\nwith the generated predictions. We provide an extensive comparative study of\nSSVAER with other publicly available semi-supervised and supervised learning\nmethods on two benchmark problems using fixed-size datasets, where we vary the\npercentage of labelled data available for training.

Existing prompt templates are\nmainly shared among all training samples with the information of task\ndescription. However, training samples are quite diverse.

Through the fusion of multiple decoding\nmethods, muti-camera targets are tracked in three dimensions: temporal logic,\nspatial logic, and feature matching. For the MOT17 dataset, this study's method\nsignificantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art method MiniTrackV2 [49]\nby 2.2% to 0.836 on Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy(MOTA) metric.\nFurthermore, this study proposes a retrospective mechanism for the first time,\nand adopts a reverse-order processing method to optimise the historical\nmislabeled targets for improving the Identification F1-score(IDF1). For the\nself-built dataset OVIT-MOT01, the IDF1 improves from 0.948 to 0.967, and the\nMulti-camera Tracking Accuracy(MCTA) improves from 0.878 to 0.909, which\nsignificantly improves the continuous tracking accuracy and scene adaptation.\nThis research method introduces a new attentional tracking paradigm which is\nable to achieve state-of-the-art performance on multi-target tracking (MOT17\nand OVIT-MOT01) tasks.",

    "abstract": "Continuous pseudo-labeling (PL) algorithms such as slimIPL have recently\nemerged as a powerful strategy for semi-supervised learning in speech\nrecognition. In contrast with earlier strategies that alternated between\ntraining a model and generating pseudo-labels (PLs) with it, here PLs are\ngenerated in end-to-end manner as training proceeds, improving training speed\nand the accuracy of the final model. PL shares a common theme with\nteacher-student models such as distillation in that a teacher model generates\ntargets that need to be mimicked by the student model being trained. However,\ninterestingly, PL strategies in general use hard-labels, whereas distillation\nuses the distribution over labels as the target to mimic. Inspired by\ndistillation we expect that specifying the whole distribution (aka soft-labels)\nover sequences as the target for unlabeled data, instead of a single best pass\npseudo-labeled transcript (hard-labels) should improve PL performance and\nconvergence. Surprisingly and unexpectedly, we find that soft-labels targets\ncan lead to training divergence, with the model collapsing to a degenerate\ntoken distribution per frame. We hypothesize that the reason this does not\nhappen with hard-labels is that training loss on hard-labels imposes\nsequence-level consistency that keeps the model from collapsing to the\ndegenerate solution. In this paper, we show several experiments that support\nthis hypothesis, and experiment with several regularization approaches that can\nameliorate the degenerate collapse when using soft-labels. These approaches can\nbring the accuracy of soft-labels closer to that of hard-labels, and while they\nare unable to outperform them yet, they serve as a useful framework for further\nimprovements.",

    "abstract": "Information Extraction (IE) aims to extract structured information from\nheterogeneous sources. IE from natural language texts include sub-tasks such as\nNamed Entity Recognition (NER), Relation Extraction (RE), and Event Extraction\n(EE). Most IE systems require comprehensive understandings of sentence\nstructure, implied semantics, and domain knowledge to perform well; thus, IE\ntasks always need adequate external resources and annotations. However, it\ntakes time and effort to obtain more human annotations. Low-Resource\nInformation Extraction (LRIE) strives to use unsupervised data, reducing the\nrequired resources and human annotation. In practice, existing systems either\nutilize self-training schemes to generate pseudo labels that will cause the\ngradual drift problem, or leverage consistency regularization methods which\ninevitably possess confirmation bias. To alleviate confirmation bias due to the\nlack of feedback loops in existing LRIE learning paradigms, we develop a\nGradient Imitation Reinforcement Learning (GIRL) method to encourage\npseudo-labeled data to imitate the gradient descent direction on labeled data,\nwhich can force pseudo-labeled data to achieve better optimization capabilities\nsimilar to labeled data. Based on how well the pseudo-labeled data imitates the\ninstructive gradient descent direction obtained from labeled data, we design a\nreward to quantify the imitation process and bootstrap the optimization\ncapability of pseudo-labeled data through trial and error. In addition to\nlearning paradigms, GIRL is not limited to specific sub-tasks, and we leverage\nGIRL to solve all IE sub-tasks (named entity recognition, relation extraction,\nand event extraction) in low-resource settings (semi-supervised IE and few-shot\nIE).",

    "abstract": "Predicting the health risks of patients using Electronic Health Records (EHR)\nhas attracted considerable attention in recent years, especially with the\ndevelopment of deep learning techniques. Health risk refers to the probability\nof the occurrence of a specific health outcome for a specific patient. The\npredicted risks can be used to support decision-making by healthcare\nprofessionals. EHRs are structured patient journey data. Each patient journey\ncontains a chronological set of clinical events, and within each clinical\nevent, there is a set of clinical/medical activities. Due to variations of\npatient conditions and treatment needs, EHR patient journey data has an\ninherently high degree of missingness that contains important information\naffecting relationships among variables, including time. Existing deep\nlearning-based models generate imputed values for missing values when learning\nthe relationships. However, imputed data in EHR patient journey data may\ndistort the clinical meaning of the original EHR patient journey data,\nresulting in classification bias. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end\napproach to modeling EHR patient journey data with Integrated Convolutional and\nRecurrent Neural Networks. Our model can capture both long- and short-term\ntemporal patterns within each patient journey and effectively handle the high\ndegree of missingness in EHR data without any imputation data generation.\nExtensive experimental results using the proposed model on two real-world\ndatasets demonstrate robust performance as well as superior prediction accuracy\ncompared to existing state-of-the-art imputation-based prediction methods.",

Our algorithm\nconsists of two phases: first construct a decision diagram $(V,E)$ that somehow\nrepresents a given $m \\times n$ constraint matrix, and then build an equivalent\nset of $|E|$ linear constraints over $n+|V|$ variables. That is, the size of\nthe resultant extended formulation depends not explicitly on the number $m$ of\nthe original constraints, but on its decision diagram representation.\nTherefore, we may significantly reduce the computation time for optimization\nproblems with integer constraint matrices by solving them under the extended\nformulations, especially when we obtain concise decision diagram\nrepresentations for the matrices. We can apply our method to $1$-norm\nregularized hard margin optimization over the binary instance space\n$\\{0,1\\}^n$, which can be formulated as a linear programming problem with $m$\nconstraints with $\\{-1,0,1\\}$-valued coefficients over $n$ variables, where $m$\nis the size of the given sample.

However, fake utterances are mostly generated by altering\ntimbre, prosody, linguistic content or channel noise of original audios. They\nignore a fake situation, in which the attacker manipulates an acoustic scene of\nthe original audio with another forgery one. It will pose a major threat to our\nsociety if some people misuse the manipulated audio with malicious purpose.\nTherefore, this motivates us to fill in the gap. This paper designs such a\ndataset for scene fake audio detection (SceneFake). A manipulated audio in the\nSceneFake dataset involves only tampering the acoustic scene of an utterance by\nusing speech enhancement technologies. We can not only detect fake utterances\non a seen test set but also evaluate the generalization of fake detection\nmodels to unseen manipulation attacks. Some benchmark results are described on\nthe SceneFake dataset. Besides, an analysis of fake attacks with different\nspeech enhancement technologies and signal-to-noise ratios are presented on the\ndataset. The results show that scene manipulated utterances can not be detected\nreliably by the existing baseline models of ASVspoof 2019.

In the single-agent\nparadigm, goal-conditioned policies have been combined with intrinsic\nmotivation mechanisms to endow agents with the ability to master a wide\ndiversity of autonomously discovered goals. Transferring this idea to\ncooperative multi-agent systems (MAS) entails a challenge: intrinsically\nmotivated agents that sample goals independently focus on a shared cooperative\ngoal with low probability, impairing their learning performance. In this work,\nwe propose a new learning paradigm for modeling such settings, the\nDecentralized Intrinsically Motivated Skill Acquisition Problem (Dec-IMSAP),\nand employ it to solve cooperative navigation tasks. Agents in a Dec-IMSAP are\ntrained in a fully decentralized way, which comes in contrast to previous\ncontributions in multi-goal MAS that consider a centralized goal-selection\nmechanism. Our empirical analysis indicates that a sufficient condition for\nefficiently learning a diversity of cooperative tasks is to ensure that a group\naligns its goals, i.e., the agents pursue the same cooperative goal and learn\nto coordinate their actions through specialization. We introduce the\nGoal-coordination game, a fully-decentralized emergent communication algorithm,\nwhere goal alignment emerges from the maximization of individual rewards in\nmulti-goal cooperative environments and show that it is able to reach equal\nperformance to a centralized training baseline that guarantees aligned goals.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first contribution addressing the problem of\nintrinsically motivated multi-agent goal exploration in a decentralized\ntraining paradigm.",

We compare the\nperformance of various generative models including variational autoencoder\n(VAE), conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), and generative adversarial\nnetwork (GAN). The numerical results show a good approximation of the traffic\narrival statistics depending on the production state. Among all generative\nmodels, CVAE provides in general the best performance in terms of the smallest\nKullback-Leibler divergence.",

    "abstract": "The integration of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations into 5G and\nBeyond is essential to achieve efficient global connectivity. As LEO satellites\nare a global infrastructure with predictable dynamics, a pre-planned fair and\nload-balanced allocation of the radio resources to provide efficient downlink\nconnectivity over large areas is an achievable goal. In this paper, we propose\na distributed and a global optimal algorithm for satellite-to-cell resource\nallocation with multiple beams. These algorithms aim to achieve a fair\nallocation of time-frequency resources and beams to the cells based on the\nnumber of users in connected mode (i.e., registered). Our analyses focus on\nevaluating the trade-offs between average per-user throughput, fairness, number\nof cell handovers, and computational complexity in a downlink scenario with\nfixed cells, where the number of users is extracted from a population map. Our\nresults show that both algorithms achieve a similar average per-user\nthroughput. However, the global optimal algorithm achieves a fairness index\nover 0.9 in all cases, which is more than twice that of the distributed\nalgorithm. Furthermore, by correctly setting the handover cost parameter, the\nnumber of handovers can be effectively reduced by more than 70% with respect to\nthe case where the handover cost is not considered.",

    "abstract": "Salient object detection (SOD) focuses on distinguishing the most conspicuous\nobjects in the scene. However, most related works are based on RGB images,\nwhich lose massive useful information. Accordingly, with the maturity of\nthermal technology, RGB-T (RGB-Thermal) multi-modality tasks attain more and\nmore attention. Thermal infrared images carry important information which can\nbe used to improve the accuracy of SOD prediction. To accomplish it, the\nmethods to integrate multi-modal information and suppress noises are critical.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel network called Interactive Context-Aware\nNetwork (ICANet). It contains three modules that can effectively perform the\ncross-modal and cross-scale fusions. We design a Hybrid Feature Fusion (HFF)\nmodule to integrate the features of two modalities, which utilizes two types of\nfeature extraction. The Multi-Scale Attention Reinforcement (MSAR) and Upper\nFusion (UF) blocks are responsible for the cross-scale fusion that converges\ndifferent levels of features and generate the prediction maps. We also raise a\nnovel Context-Aware Multi-Supervised Network (CAMSNet) to calculate the content\nloss between the prediction and the ground truth (GT).

In pathology, the digitization of\ndiagnostic tissue samples inevitably generates identifying data that can\nconsist of sensitive but also acquisition-related information stored in\nvendor-specific file formats. Distribution and off-clinical use of these Whole\nSlide Images (WSI) is usually done in these formats, as an industry-wide\nstandardization such as DICOM is yet only tentatively adopted and slide scanner\nvendors currently do not provide anonymization functionality.\nMethods: We developed a guideline for the proper handling of\nhistopathological image data particularly for research and education with\nregard to the GDPR. In this context, we evaluated existing anonymization\nmethods and examined proprietary format specifications to identify all\nsensitive information for the most common WSI formats. This work results in a\nsoftware library that enables GDPR-compliant anonymization of WSIs while\npreserving the native formats.\nResults: Based on the analysis of proprietary formats, all occurrences of\nsensitive information were identified for file formats frequently used in\nclinical routine, and finally, an open-source programming library with an\nexecutable CLI-tool and wrappers for different programming languages was\ndeveloped.\nConclusions: Our analysis showed that there is no straightforward software\nsolution to anonymize WSIs in a GDPR-compliant way while maintaining the data\nformat.

    "abstract": "In the past few years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has garnered attention\nfrom various industries including financial services (FS). AI has made a\npositive impact in financial services by enhancing productivity and improving\nrisk management. While AI can offer efficient solutions, it has the potential\nto bring unintended consequences. One such consequence is the pronounced effect\nof AI-related unfairness and attendant fairness-related harms. These\nfairness-related harms could involve differential treatment of individuals; for\nexample, unfairly denying a loan to certain individuals or groups of\nindividuals. In this paper, we focus on identifying and mitigating individual\nunfairness and leveraging some of the recently published techniques in this\ndomain, especially as applicable to the credit adjudication use case. We also\ninvestigate the extent to which techniques for achieving individual fairness\nare effective at achieving group fairness. Our main contribution in this work\nis functionalizing a two-step training process which involves learning a fair\nsimilarity metric from a group sense using a small portion of the raw data and\ntraining an individually \"fair\" classifier using the rest of the data where the\nsensitive features are excluded. The key characteristic of this two-step\ntechnique is related to its flexibility, i.e., the fair metric obtained in the\nfirst step can be used with any other individual fairness algorithms in the\nsecond step. Furthermore, we developed a second metric (distinct from the fair\nsimilarity metric) to determine how fairly a model is treating similar\nindividuals. We use this metric to compare a \"fair\" model against its baseline\nmodel in terms of their individual fairness value. Finally, some experimental\nresults corresponding to the individual unfairness mitigation techniques are\npresented.",

    "abstract": "Radar, the only sensor that could provide reliable perception capability in\nall weather conditions at an affordable cost, has been widely accepted as a key\nsupplement to camera and LiDAR in modern advanced driver assistance systems\n(ADAS) and autonomous driving systems. Recent state-of-the-art works reveal\nthat fusion of radar and LiDAR can lead to robust detection in adverse weather,\nsuch as fog. However, these methods still suffer from low accuracy of bounding\nbox estimations. This paper proposes a bird's-eye view (BEV) fusion learning\nfor an anchor box-free object detection system, which uses the feature derived\nfrom the radar range-azimuth heatmap and the LiDAR point cloud to estimate the\npossible objects. Different label assignment strategies have been designed to\nfacilitate the consistency between the classification of foreground or\nbackground anchor points and the corresponding bounding box regressions.\nFurthermore, the performance of the proposed object detector can be further\nenhanced by employing a novel interactive transformer module.

Since IPHS\nmodels are consistent with the first and second principles of thermodynamics by\ndesign, so are the proposed Physically Consistent NODEs (PC-NODEs).\nFurthermore, the NODE training procedure allows us to seamlessly incorporate\nprior knowledge of the system properties in the learned dynamics. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by learning the\nthermodynamics of a building from the real-world measurements and the dynamics\nof a simulated gas-piston system. Thanks to the modularity and flexibility of\nthe IPHS framework, PC-NODEs can be extended to learn physically consistent\nmodels of multi-physics distributed systems.",

    "abstract": "The performance of distributed and data-centric applications often critically\ndepends on the interconnecting network. Emerging reconfigurable datacenter\nnetworks (RDCNs) are a particularly innovative approach to improve datacenter\nthroughput. Relying on a dynamic optical topology which can be adjusted towards\nthe workload in a demand-aware manner, RDCNs allow to exploit temporal and\nspatial locality in the communication pattern, and to provide topological\nshortcuts for frequently communicating racks. The key challenge, however,\nconcerns how to realize demand-awareness in RDCNs in a scalable fashion.\nThis paper presents and evaluates Chopin, a hybrid scheduler for\nself-adjusting networks that provides demand-awareness at low overhead, by\ncombining centralized and distributed approaches. Chopin allocates optical\ncircuits to elephant flows, through its slower centralized scheduler, utilizing\nglobal information. Chopin's distributed scheduler is orders of magnitude\nfaster and can swiftly react to changes in the traffic and adjust the optical\ncircuits accordingly, by using only local information and running at each rack\nseparately.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Human-machine collaboration is a promising strategy to improve\nhazard inspection. However, research on the effective integration of opinions\nfrom humans with machines for optimal group decision making is lacking. Hence,\nconsidering the benefits of a brain-computer interface (BCI) to enable\nintuitive commutation, this study proposes a novel method to predict human\nhazard response choices and decision confidence from brain activities for a\nsuperior confidence-weighted voting strategy. Methodology: First, we developed\na Bayesian inference-based algorithm to ascertain the decision threshold above\nwhich a hazard is reported from human brain signals. This method was tested\nempirically with electroencephalogram (EEG) data collected in a laboratory\nsetting and cross-validated using behavioral indices of the signal detection\ntheory. Subsequently, based on numerical simulations, the decision criteria for\nlow-, medium-, and high-confidence level differentiations characterized by\nparietal alpha-band EEG power were determined. Findings : The investigated\nhazard recognition task was described as a process of probabilistic inference\ninvolving a decision uncertainty evaluation. The results demonstrated the\nfeasibility of EEG measurements in observing human internal representations of\nhazard discrimination. Moreover, the optimal criteria to differentiate between\nlow-, medium-, and high-confidence levels were obtained by benchmarking against\nan optimal Bayesian observer. Originality: This research demonstrates the\npotential of a BCI as an effective channel for telecommunication, laying the\nfoundation for the design of future hazard detection techniques in the\ncollaborative human-machine systems research field.",

    "abstract": "The electrification of shared mobility has become popular across the globe.\nMany cities have their new shared e-mobility systems deployed, with\ncontinuously expanding coverage from central areas to the city edges. A key\nchallenge in the operation of these systems is fleet rebalancing, i.e., how EVs\nshould be repositioned to better satisfy future demand. This is particularly\nchallenging in the context of expanding systems, because i) the range of the\nEVs is limited while charging time is typically long, which constrain the\nviable rebalancing operations; and ii) the EV stations in the system are\ndynamically changing, i.e., the legitimate targets for rebalancing operations\ncan vary over time. We tackle these challenges by first investigating rich sets\nof data collected from a real-world shared e-mobility system for one year,\nanalyzing the operation model, usage patterns and expansion dynamics of this\nnew mobility mode. With the learned knowledge we design a high-fidelity\nsimulator, which is able to abstract key operation details of EV sharing at\nfine granularity. Then we model the rebalancing task for shared e-mobility\nsystems under continuous expansion as a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning\n(MARL) problem, which directly takes the range and charging properties of the\nEVs into account. We further propose a novel policy optimization approach with\naction cascading, which is able to cope with the expansion dynamics and solve\nthe formulated MARL. We evaluate the proposed approach extensively, and\nexperimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art,\noffering significant performance gain in both satisfied demand and net revenue.",

Fair\nML has largely focused on the protection of single attributes in the simpler\nsetting where both attributes and target outcomes are binary. However, the\npractical application in many a real-world problem entails the simultaneous\nprotection of multiple sensitive attributes, which are often not simply binary,\nbut continuous or categorical. To address this more challenging task, we\nintroduce FairCOCCO, a fairness measure built on cross-covariance operators on\nreproducing kernel Hilbert Spaces. This leads to two practical tools: first,\nthe FairCOCCO Score, a normalised metric that can quantify fairness in settings\nwith single or multiple sensitive attributes of arbitrary type; and second, a\nsubsequent regularisation term that can be incorporated into arbitrary learning\nobjectives to obtain fair predictors.

    "title": "MaskedSpeech: Context-aware Speech Synthesis with Masking Strategy",
    "abstract": "Humans often speak in a continuous manner which leads to coherent and\nconsistent prosody properties across neighboring utterances. However, most\nstate-of-the-art speech synthesis systems only consider the information within\neach sentence and ignore the contextual semantic and acoustic features. This\nmakes it inadequate to generate high-quality paragraph-level speech which\nrequires high expressiveness and naturalness. To synthesize natural and\nexpressive speech for a paragraph, a context-aware speech synthesis system\nnamed MaskedSpeech is proposed in this paper, which considers both contextual\nsemantic and acoustic features. Inspired by the masking strategy in the speech\nediting research, the acoustic features of the current sentence are masked out\nand concatenated with those of contextual speech, and further used as\nadditional model input. The phoneme encoder takes the concatenated phoneme\nsequence from neighboring sentences as input and learns fine-grained semantic\ninformation from contextual text. Furthermore, cross-utterance coarse-grained\nsemantic features are employed to improve the prosody generation. The model is\ntrained to reconstruct the masked acoustic features with the augmentation of\nboth the contextual semantic and acoustic features. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed MaskedSpeech outperformed the baseline system\nsignificantly in terms of naturalness and expressiveness.",

    "abstract": "The dichotomy between the challenging nature of obtaining annotations for\nactivities, and the more straightforward nature of data collection from\nwearables, has resulted in significant interest in the development of\ntechniques that utilize large quantities of unlabeled data for learning\nrepresentations. Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) is one such method,\nlearning effective representations by leveraging properties of time-series data\nto setup a contrastive future timestep prediction task. In this work, we\npropose enhancements to CPC, by systematically investigating the encoder\narchitecture, the aggregator network, and the future timestep prediction,\nresulting in a fully convolutional architecture, thereby improving\nparallelizability. Across sensor positions and activities, our method shows\nsubstantial improvements on four of six target datasets, demonstrating its\nability to empower a wide range of application scenarios. Further, in the\npresence of very limited labeled data, our technique significantly outperforms\nboth supervised and self-supervised baselines, positively impacting situations\nwhere collecting only a few seconds of labeled data may be possible.

    "abstract": "The generation of Chinese fonts has a wide range of applications. The\ncurrently predominated methods are mainly based on deep generative models,\nespecially the generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, existing\nGAN-based models usually suffer from the well-known mode collapse problem. When\nmode collapse happens, the kind of GAN-based models will be failure to yield\nthe correct fonts. To address this issue, we introduce a one-bit stroke\nencoding and a few-shot semi-supervised scheme (i.e., using a few paired data\nas semi-supervised information) to explore the local and global structure\ninformation of Chinese characters respectively, motivated by the intuition that\nstrokes and characters directly embody certain local and global modes of\nChinese characters. Based on these ideas, this paper proposes an effective\nmodel called \\textit{StrokeGAN+}, which incorporates the stroke encoding and\nthe few-shot semi-supervised scheme into the CycleGAN model. The effectiveness\nof the proposed model is demonstrated by amounts of experiments. Experimental\nresults show that the mode collapse issue can be effectively alleviated by the\nintroduced one-bit stroke encoding and few-shot semi-supervised training\nscheme, and that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art models in\nfourteen font generation tasks in terms of four important evaluation metrics\nand the quality of generated characters. Besides CycleGAN, we also show that\nthe proposed idea can be adapted to other existing models to improve their\nperformance.

The most salient example is the Artificial\nIntelligence Act (AIA) proposed by the European Commission. The article\naddresses challenges for adequate risk regulation that arise primarily from the\nspecific type of risks involved, i.e. risks to the protection of fundamental\nrights and fundamental societal values. They result mainly from the normative\nambiguity of the fundamental rights and societal values in interpreting,\nspecifying or operationalising them for risk assessments. This is exemplified\nfor (1) human dignity, (2) informational self-determination, data protection\nand privacy, (3) justice and fairness, and (4) the common good. Normative\nambiguities require normative choices, which are distributed among different\nactors in the proposed AIA. Particularly critical normative choices are those\nof selecting normative conceptions for specifying risks, aggregating and\nquantifying risks including the use of metrics, balancing of value conflicts,\nsetting levels of acceptable risks, and standardisation.

The proposed method augments the system\ndynamics with an approximated internal linear model of the combined\ncontribution of known nonlinearities and unknown faults -- leading to an\napproximated linear model in the augmented state. We exploit the broad modeling\npower of ultra-local models to characterize this internal dynamics. We use a\nlinear filter to reconstruct the augmented state (simultaneously estimating the\nstate of the original system and the sum of nonlinearities and faults). Having\nthis combined estimate, we can simply subtract the analytic expression of\nnonlinearities from that of the corresponding estimate to reconstruct the fault\nvector. Because the nonlinearity does not play a role in the filter dynamics\n(it is only used as a static nonlinear output to estimate the fault), we can\navoid standard restrictive assumptions like globally (one-sided) Lipschitz\nnonlinearities and/or the need for Lipschitz constants to carry out the filter\ndesign.

    "abstract": "Universal Image Segmentation is not a new concept. Past attempts to unify\nimage segmentation in the last decades include scene parsing, panoptic\nsegmentation, and, more recently, new panoptic architectures. However, such\npanoptic architectures do not truly unify image segmentation because they need\nto be trained individually on the semantic, instance, or panoptic segmentation\nto achieve the best performance. Ideally, a truly universal framework should be\ntrained only once and achieve SOTA performance across all three image\nsegmentation tasks. To that end, we propose OneFormer, a universal image\nsegmentation framework that unifies segmentation with a multi-task train-once\ndesign. We first propose a task-conditioned joint training strategy that\nenables training on ground truths of each domain (semantic, instance, and\npanoptic segmentation) within a single multi-task training process. Secondly,\nwe introduce a task token to condition our model on the task at hand, making\nour model task-dynamic to support multi-task training and inference. Thirdly,\nwe propose using a query-text contrastive loss during training to establish\nbetter inter-task and inter-class distinctions. Notably, our single OneFormer\nmodel outperforms specialized Mask2Former models across all three segmentation\ntasks on ADE20k, CityScapes, and COCO, despite the latter being trained on each\nof the three tasks individually with three times the resources. With new\nConvNeXt and DiNAT backbones, we observe even more performance improvement. We\nbelieve OneFormer is a significant step towards making image segmentation more\nuniversal and accessible.

Here we describe\nthe simplest balance controller that leads to robust walking for a linear\ninverted pendulum (LIP) model. The main idea is to use a linear function of the\nbody velocity to determine the next foot placement, which we call linear foot\nplacement control (LFPC). By using the Poincar\\'e map, a balance criterion is\nderived, which shows that LFPC is stable when the velocity-feedback coefficient\nis located in a certain range. And that range is much bigger when stepping\nfaster, which indicates \"faster stepping, easier to balance\". We show that\nvarious gaits can be generated by adjusting the controller parameters in LFPC.\nParticularly, a dead-beat controller is discovered that can lead to\nsteady-state walking in just one step. The effectiveness of LFPC is verified\nthrough Matlab simulation as well as V-REP simulation for both 2D and 3D\nwalking. The main feature of LFPC is its simplicity and inherent robustness,\nwhich may help us understand the essence of how to maintain balance in dynamic\nwalking.",

    "abstract": "A distributed control of vehicle platooning is referred to as distributed\nconsensus (DC) since many autonomous vehicles (AVs) reach a consensus to move\nas one body with the same velocity and inter-distance. For DC control to be\nstable, other AVs' real-time position information should be inputted to each\nAV's controller via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. On the other hand,\ntoo many V2V links should be simultaneously established and frequently\nretrained, causing frequent packet loss and longer communication latency. We\npropose a novel DC algorithm called over-the-air consensus (AirCons), a joint\ncommunication-and-control design with two key features to overcome the above\nlimitations. First, exploiting a wireless signal's superposition and\nbroadcasting properties renders all AVs' signals to converge to a specific\nvalue proportional to participating AVs' average position without individual\nV2V channel information. Second, the estimated average position is used to\ncontrol each AV's dynamics instead of each AV's individual position. Through\nanalytic and numerical studies, the effectiveness of the proposed AirCons\ndesigned on the state-of-the-art New Radio architecture is verified by showing\na $14.22\\%$ control gain compared to the benchmark without the average\nposition.",

    "abstract": "Text-driven person image generation is an emerging and challenging task in\ncross-modality image generation. Controllable person image generation promotes\na wide range of applications such as digital human interaction and virtual\ntry-on. However, previous methods mostly employ single-modality information as\nthe prior condition (e.g. pose-guided person image generation), or utilize the\npreset words for text-driven human synthesis. Introducing a sentence composed\nof free words with an editable semantic pose map to describe person appearance\nis a more user-friendly way. In this paper, we propose HumanDiffusion, a\ncoarse-to-fine alignment diffusion framework, for text-driven person image\ngeneration. Specifically, two collaborative modules are proposed, the Stylized\nMemory Retrieval (SMR) module for fine-grained feature distillation in data\nprocessing and the Multi-scale Cross-modality Alignment (MCA) module for\ncoarse-to-fine feature alignment in diffusion. These two modules guarantee the\nalignment quality of the text and image, from image-level to feature-level,\nfrom low-resolution to high-resolution. As a result, HumanDiffusion realizes\nopen-vocabulary person image generation with desired semantic poses. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on DeepFashion demonstrate the superiority of our method\ncompared with previous approaches. Moreover, better results could be obtained\nfor complicated person images with various details and uncommon poses.",

In contrast, the human\nbrain is able to efficiently learn effective control strategies using limited\nresources. This raises the question whether insights from neuroscience can be\nused to improve current RL methods. Predictive processing is a popular\ntheoretical framework which maintains that the human brain is actively seeking\nto minimize surprise. We show that recurrent neural networks which predict\ntheir own sensory states can be leveraged to minimise surprise, yielding\nsubstantial gains in cumulative reward. Specifically, we present the Predictive\nProcessing Proximal Policy Optimization (P4O) agent; an actor-critic\nreinforcement learning agent that applies predictive processing to a recurrent\nvariant of the PPO algorithm by integrating a world model in its hidden state.\nP4O significantly outperforms a baseline recurrent variant of the PPO algorithm\non multiple Atari games using a single GPU. It also outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art agents given the same wall-clock time and exceeds human gamer\nperformance on multiple games including Seaquest, which is a particularly\nchallenging environment in the Atari domain.

    "title": "One-Time Model Adaptation to Heterogeneous Clients: An Intra-Client and  Inter-Image Attention Design",
    "abstract": "The mainstream workflow of image recognition applications is first training\none global model on the cloud for a wide range of classes and then serving\nnumerous clients, each with heterogeneous images from a small subset of classes\nto be recognized. From the cloud-client discrepancies on the range of image\nclasses, the recognition model is desired to have strong adaptiveness,\nintuitively by concentrating the focus on each individual client's local\ndynamic class subset, while incurring negligible overhead. In this work, we\npropose to plug a new intra-client and inter-image attention (ICIIA) module\ninto existing backbone recognition models, requiring only one-time cloud-based\ntraining to be client-adaptive. In particular, given a target image from a\ncertain client, ICIIA introduces multi-head self-attention to retrieve relevant\nimages from the client's historical unlabeled images, thereby calibrating the\nfocus and the recognition result. Further considering that ICIIA's overhead is\ndominated by linear projection, we propose partitioned linear projection with\nfeature shuffling for replacement and allow increasing the number of partitions\nto dramatically improve efficiency without scarifying too much accuracy. We\nfinally evaluate ICIIA using 3 different recognition tasks with 9 backbone\nmodels over 5 representative datasets. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of ICIIA. Specifically, for ImageNet-1K with\nthe backbone models of MobileNetV3-L and Swin-B, ICIIA can improve the testing\naccuracy to 83.37% (+8.11%) and 88.86% (+5.28%), while adding only 1.62% and\n0.02% of FLOPs, respectively.",

    "abstract": "HVDC is a critically important technology for the large-scale integration of\nrenewable resources such as offshore wind farms. Currently, only point-to-point\nand multi-terminal HVDC connections exist in real-life operation. However, with\nthe advancement of VSC-based converter technologies, future HVDC systems are\nforeseen to develop into meshed HVDC grids. Bipolar HVDC grids can be operated\nin an unbalanced way during single pole outages or in form of mixed monopolar\nand bipolar grids. However, currently, there are no (optimal) power flow tools\nto study the feasibility of such systems. Therefore, we develop an optimal\npower flow (OPF) model for hybrid AC-DC grids to capture the DC side unbalances\nand allowing to efficiently plan and operate such future grids. In this paper,\nwe present a multi-conductor OPF model with separate modeling of the positive\npole, negative pole, metallic return conductors, and ground return. The\ncapabilities of the model are demonstrated on a small test case, including\nmonopolar tapping over a bipolar DC link. It is demonstrated that the developed\nOPF model can capture the loop flows between the different poles in unbalanced\nconditions, as opposed to the existing single-wire representations in the\nliterature. Further, numerical results are presented for multiple test cases\nwith various system sizes, starting from an 11-bus system to a 3120-bus system\nto demonstrate the computational tractability of the chosen model formulation.",

    "abstract": "Practical operations of coordinated fleets of mobile robots in different\nenvironments reveal benefits of maintaining small distances between robots as\nthey move at higher speeds. This is counter-intuitive in that as speed\nincreases, increased distances would give robots a larger time to respond to\nsudden motion variations in surrounding robots. However, there is a desire to\nhave lower inter-robot distances in examples like autonomous trucks on highways\nto optimize energy by vehicle drafting or smaller robots in cluttered\nenvironments to maintain communication, etc. This work introduces a model based\ncontrol framework that directly takes non-linear system dynamics into account.\nEach robot is able to follow closer at high speeds because it makes predictions\non the state information from its adjacent robots and biases it's response by\nanticipating adjacent robots' motion. In contrast to existing controllers, our\nnon-linear model based predictive decentralized controller is able to achieve\nlower inter-robot distances at higher speeds.

The chapter\nbegins with an introduction to Mathieu's equation and its stability analysis\nusing the monodromy matrix; generalizations to systems with multiple degrees of\nfreedom are then pursued. The progressive character of the modulation leads to\na factorization of the monodromy matrix and provides a \"discrete change of\nvariables\" otherwise only available for continuous systems.

The current study\naims to solve the existing dilemma by examining COVID transmission inside a\nclassroom and providing long-term sustainable solutions. In this work, a\nstandard 5m x 3m x 5m classroom is considered where 24 students are seated,\naccompanied by a teacher. A computational fluid dynamics simulation based on\nOpenFOAM is performed using a Eulerian-Lagrangian framework. Based on the\nstochastic dose response framework, we have evaluated the infection risk in the\nclassroom for two distinct cases: (i) certain students are infected (ii) the\nteacher is infected. If the teacher is infected, the probability of infection\ncould reach 100% for certain students. When certain students are infected, the\nmaximum infection risk for a susceptible person reaches 30%. The commonly used\ncloth mask proves to be ineffective in providing protection against infection\ntransmission reducing the maximum infection probability by approximately 26%\nonly. Another commonly used solution in the form of shields installed on desks\nhave also failed to provide adequate protection against infection reducing the\ninfection risk only by 50%. Furthermore, the shields serves as a source of\nfomite mode of infection. Screens suspended from the ceiling, which entrap\ndroplets, have been proposed as a novel solution that reduces the infection\nrisk by 90% and 95% compared to the no screen scenario besides being completely\ndevoid of fomite infection mode. As a result of the screens, the class-time can\nbe extended by 55 minutes.",

Despite the potential of\nFWI for high resolution seismic imaging, this technique is a nonlinear\noptimization and may be trapped into local minima. Wavefield reconstruction\ninversion (WRI) relaxes the condition that the wave equation associated with a\ntrue physical source does need to be accurately satisfied during the iteration\nprocess. Alternatively, extended source waveform inversion (ESI) introduces a\nnon-physical source deployed into the whole computing domain for matching the\nobserved data by synthetic data. The iterative process will move this extended\nsource to the physical source. WRI and ESI are formulated within the same\nmathematical framework using Lagrangian-based adjoint-state method with a\nspecial focus on time-domain formulation using extended sources, while putting\nconnections between classical FWI, WRI and ESI: both WRI and ESI can be viewed\nas weighted versions of classic FWI. Due to symmetric positive definite\nHessian, the conjugate gradient is explored to efficiently solve the normal\nequation in a matrix free manner, while both time and frequency domain wave\nequation solvers are feasible. The most significant challenge comes from the\nhuge storage demand to store time-domain wavefields through iterations.

The idea is to adopt a hybrid global-IGA/local-FEM modeling,\nthereby benefiting from: (i) the superior geometric description and\nper-Degree-Of-Freedom accuracy of IGA for capturing global, regular responses,\nand (ii) the ability of FEM to compute local, strongly non-linear or even\nsingular behaviors. For the sake of minimizing the implementation effort, we\ndevelop a coupling scheme that is fully non-invasive in the sense that the\ninitial global spline model to be enriched is never modified and the\nconstruction of the coupling operators can be performed using conventional FE\npackages. The key ingredient is to express the FEM-to-IGA bridge, based on\nB{\\'e}zier extraction, to transform the initial global spline interface into a\nFE one on which the local FE mesh can be constructed. This allows to resort to\nclassic FE trace operators to implement the coupling.

    "title": "Reference Governor Design in the Presence of Uncertain Polynomial  Constraints",
    "abstract": "Reference governors are add-on schemes that are used to modify trajectories\nto prevent controlled dynamical systems from violating constraints and so are\nplaying an increasingly important role in aerospace, robotic, and other\nengineering applications. Here we present a novel reference governor design for\nsystems whose polynomial constraints depend on unknown bounded parameters. This\nis a significant departure from earlier treatments of reference governors,\nwhere the constraints were linear or known, because here we transfer the\nuncertainties into the constraints instead of having them in the closed loop\ndynamics, which greatly simplifies the task of determining future evolution of\nthe constraints. Unlike our earlier treatment of reference governors with\npolynomial constraints, which transformed the constraints into linear ones that\ndepend on an augmented state of the system, here we transform the constraints\ninto linear ones that depend on both the system's state and uncertain\nparameters. Convexity allows us to compute the maximal output admissible set\nfor an uncertain pre-stabilized linear system. We show that it is sufficient to\nonly consider the extreme values of the uncertain parameters when computing and\npropagating the polynomial constraints. We illustrate our method using an\nuncertain longitudinal dynamics for civilian aircraft, which is controlled\nusing a disturbance compensation method and needs to satisfy input and state\nconstraints, and where our reference governor method ensures that safety\nconstraints are always satisfied.",

    "abstract": "Microstructure evolution in additive manufacturing (AM) is a complex process\nand understanding the impact of AM process conditions on microstructure and the\nresulting mechanical properties of the printed part is an area of active\nresearch. In this context, high-fidelity numerical modeling of the AM process\nat various relevant length-scales has been finding favor. At the meltpool\nscale, the thermo-fluidic equations have been extensively modeled to understand\nthe meltpool conditions and thermal gradients. In many physical processes,\ndimensional analysis and identification of important dimensionless numbers can\nprovide significant insights into the process dynamics. In this context, we\npresent a novel strategy using dimensional analysis and the least-squares\nregression approach, in conjunction with physics-based insights, to investigate\nthe thermo-fluidic governing equations of the AM process. Through this\napproach, we identify important dimensionless quantities influencing meltpool\nmorphology. The governing equations are solved using the Finite Element Method,\nand the model predictions are validated by comparing them with experimental and\nnumerical results from the literature. We then present our dimensional analysis\nand define an important dimensionless quantity - interpreted as a measure of\nheat absorbed by the material and the meltpool. We then use this measure of\nheat absorbed, along with classical dimensionless quantities relevant to the\nthermo-fluidic governing equations, to investigate advective transport in the\nmeltpool for different metal alloys. This understanding helps us characterize\nthe meltpool aspect ratio and volume in terms of the Marangoni, and Stefan\nnumbers. Further, we study the variations of thermal gradients and the\nsolidification cooling rate using this framework and examine the effect of the\nPeclet number on the microstructure of the solidified meltpool region.",

A social network forms a graph structure\nwhilst Graph neural networks (GNN), a promising research domain in Deep\nLearning, can seamlessly process non-Euclidean graph data . In financial fraud\ndetection, the modus operandi of criminals can be identified by analyzing user\nprofile and their behaviors such as transaction, loaning etc. as well as their\nsocial connectivity. Currently, most GNNs are incapable of selecting important\nneighbors since the neighbors' edge attributes (i.e., behaviors) are ignored.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel behavior information aggregation network\n(BIAN) to combine the user behaviors with other user features. Different from\nits close \"relatives\" such as Graph Attention Networks (GAT) and Graph\nTransformer Networks (GTN), it aggregates neighbors based on neighboring edge\nattribute distribution, namely, user behaviors in financial social network.

    "abstract": "We examined a large population of Polish science, technology, engineering,\nmathematics and medicine (STEMM) scientists (N = 16,083) to study rank\nadvancement and productivity. We used two previously neglected time dimensions\n- promotion age and promotion speed - to construct individual biographical\nprofiles and publication profiles. We used a classificatory approach and the\nnew methodological approach of journal prestige-normalized productivity. All\nscientists were allocated to different productivity, promotion age, and\npromotion speed classes (top 20%, middle 60%, and bottom 20%). The patterns\nwere consistent across all disciplines: scientists in young promotion age\nclasses (and fast promotion speed classes) in the past were currently the most\nproductive. In contrast, scientists in old promotion age classes (and slow\npromotion speed classes) in the past were currently the least productive. In\nthe three largest disciplines, the young-old promotion age productivity\ndifferential for associate professors was 100-200% (150-200% for full\nprofessors); and the fast-slow promotion speed productivity differential for\nassociate professors was 80-150% (100-170% for full professors). Our results\nwere confirmed by a regression analysis in which we found odds ratio estimates\nof membership in top productivity classes.

    "abstract": "A Nation's responsibility is to predict in advance and protect human\nwellbeing in conflict including protection from moral injury and unjust\nattribution of responsibility for their actions. This position paper considers\nresponsibility for unlawful killings by human AI teams drawing on a metaphor\nfrom Neta Crawford's chapter, When Soldiers Snap: Bad Apples and Mad Apples, in\nAccountability for Killing: Moral responsibility for collateral damage in\nAmerica's post 911 wars. This paper contends that although militaries may have\nsome bad apples responsible for war crimes and some mad apples unable to be\nresponsible for their actions during a conflict, increasingly militaries may\ncook their good apples by putting them in untenable decision making\nenvironments with AI. A cooked apple may be pushed beyond reasonable limits\nleading to a loss of situational awareness, cognitive overload, loss of agency\nand autonomy leading to automation bias. In these cases, moral responsibility\nand perhaps even legal responsibility for unlawful deaths may be contested for\ncooked apples, risking operators becoming moral crumple zones and or suffering\nmoral injury from being part of larger human AI systems authorised by the\nstate. Nations are responsible for minimising risks to humans within reasonable\nbounds and compliance with legal obligations in human AI military teams, and\nthe military systems used to make or implement decisions. The paper suggests\nthat best practise WHS frameworks might be drawn on in development, acquisition\nand training ahead of deployment of systems in conflicts to predict and\nmitigate risks of human AI military teams.",

With recent advancements in deep learning,\nmethods utilizing graph representation learning and deep clustering have shown\ngreat results in community detection. However, these methods often rely on the\ntopology of networks (i) ignoring important features such as network\nheterogeneity, temporality, multimodality, and other possibly relevant\nfeatures. Besides, (ii) the number of communities is not known a priori and is\noften left to model selection. In addition, (iii) in multimodal networks all\nnodes are assumed to be symmetrical in their features; while true for\nhomogeneous networks, most of the real-world networks are heterogeneous where\nfeature availability often varies. In this paper, we propose a novel framework\n(named MGTCOM) that overcomes the above challenges (i)--(iii).

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the potential of reconfigurable intelligent surface\n(RIS) for passive information transfer in a RIS-aided multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO) system. We propose a novel technique named simultaneous\nactive and passive information transfer (SAPIT). In SAPIT, both the transmitter\n(Tx) and the RIS deliver information, where the RIS information is carried\nthrough the RIS phase shifts embedded in reflected signals. We introduce the\ncoded modulation technique at the RIS to avoid the burden of reflection pattern\ndesign in the existing approaches. The main challenge of the proposed\nSAPIT-MIMO transceiver is to simultaneously detect the Tx signals and the RIS\nphase coefficients at the receiver. To address this challenge, we introduce\nappropriate auxiliary variables to convert the original signal model into two\nlinear models with respect to the Tx signals and one entry-by-entry bilinear\nmodel with respect to the RIS phase coefficients. Based on this auxiliary\nsystem, we develop a low-complexity message-passing algorithm to solve the\ndetection problem. Furthermore, we analyze the fundamental performance limit of\nthe proposed SAPIT-MIMO transceiver. Notably, we establish the state evolution\nto characterize the receiver performance in a system of a large size. Based on\nthe SE, we further analyze the achievable sum rate of the Tx and the RIS. The\nrate analysis provides insights into the code design for sum-rate maximization.\nNumerical results are provided to validate our theoretical analysis and show\nthe superiority of the SAPIT-MIMO transceiver over the counterpart passive\nbeamforming scheme.",

In the past four years, a particularly\nimportant development in the digital advertising industry is the shift from\nsecond-price auctions to first-price auctions for online display ads. This\nshift immediately motivated the intellectually challenging question of how to\nbid in first-price auctions, because unlike in second-price auctions, bidding\none's private value truthfully is no longer optimal. Following a series of\nrecent works in this area, we consider a differentiated setup: we do not make\nany assumption about other bidders' maximum bid (i.e. it can be adversarial\nover time), and instead assume that we have access to a hint that serves as a\nprediction of other bidders' maximum bid, where the prediction is learned\nthrough some blackbox machine learning model. We consider two types of hints:\none where a single point-prediction is available, and the other where a hint\ninterval (representing a type of confidence region into which others' maximum\nbid falls) is available. We establish minimax optimal regret bounds for both\ncases and highlight the quantitatively different behavior between the two\nsettings. We also provide improved regret bounds when the others' maximum bid\nexhibits the further structure of sparsity. Finally, we complement the\ntheoretical results with demonstrations using real bidding data.",

    "abstract": "To offer accurate and diverse recommendation services, recent methods use\nauxiliary information to foster the learning process of user and item\nrepresentations. Many SOTA methods fuse different sources of information (user,\nitem, knowledge graph, tags, etc.) into a graph and use Graph Neural Networks\nto introduce the auxiliary information through the message passing paradigm. In\nthis work, we seek an alternative framework that is light and effective through\nself-supervised learning across different sources of information, particularly\nfor the commonly accessible item tag information. We use a self-supervision\nsignal to pair users with the auxiliary information associated with the items\nthey have interacted with before. To achieve the pairing, we create a proxy\ntraining task. For a given item, the model predicts the correct pairing between\nthe representations obtained from the users that have interacted with this item\nand the assigned tags. This design provides an efficient solution, using the\nauxiliary information directly to enhance the quality of user and item\nembeddings. User behavior in recommendation systems is driven by the complex\ninteractions of many factors behind the decision-making processes. To make the\npairing process more fine-grained and avoid embedding collapse, we propose an\nintent-aware self-supervised pairing process where we split the user embeddings\ninto multiple sub-embedding vectors. Each sub-embedding vector captures a\nspecific user intent via self-supervised alignment with a particular cluster of\ntags. We integrate our designed framework with various recommendation models,\ndemonstrating its flexibility and compatibility. Through comparison with\nnumerous SOTA methods on seven real-world datasets, we show that our method can\nachieve better performance while requiring less training time.

However, existing systems lack the\nnecessary mechanisms to provide humans with a holistic view of their\ncompetence, presenting an impediment to their adoption, particularly in\ncritical applications where the decisions an agent makes can have significant\nconsequences. Yet, existing RL-based systems are essentially competency-unaware\nin that they lack the necessary interpretation mechanisms to allow human\noperators to have an insightful, holistic view of their competency. In this\npaper, we extend a recently-proposed framework for explainable RL that is based\non analyses of \"interestingness.\" Our new framework provides various measures\nof RL agent competence stemming from interestingness analysis and is applicable\nto a wide range of RL algorithms. We also propose novel mechanisms for\nassessing RL agents' competencies that: 1) identify agent behavior patterns and\ncompetency-controlling conditions by clustering agent behavior traces solely\nusing interestingness data; and 2) identify the task elements mostly\nresponsible for an agent's behavior, as measured through interestingness, by\nperforming global and local analyses using SHAP values.

The proposed algorithm actively\nconsiders all changes in the environment and performs the replanning process\nonly on waypoints that are occupied by new obstacles. This helps to reduce the\ncomputation time and realize the proposed approach in real time. The\nfeasibility of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using the Intel Aero\nReady-to-Fly (RTF) quadcopter in simulation and in a real-world experiment.",

    "abstract": "There has been much recent work on multiwinner voting systems. However,\nsometimes a committee is highly structured, and if we want to vote for such a\ncommittee, our voting method should be more structured as well. We consider\ncommittees consisting of representatives for disjoint parts of a collective;\nfor instance, n departments of an organization might each have m possible\nrepresentatives to choose from. However, in our model the entire population\nstill gets to vote on the committee, and we need to respect that symmetry,\nwhich we do by building on earlier work of Barcelo et al. using representation\ntheory of wreath products. The main thrust of this paper is to advertise and\ncatalog the surprising variety of possible points-based (linear) voting methods\nin this framework. For instance, if a voter ranks all possible structured\ncommittees, it may be reasonable to use weights which depend on the relations\nbetween the ranked committees, and not just their order as in 'traditional'\nvoting frameworks!",

Classical learning theory implies sample complexity of $O(\\xi^{-1}\n\\log(1/\\beta))$ (for generalization error $\\xi$ with confidence $1-\\beta$).

Progress on\nquantifying this dependence, via lower and upper bounds, was made in a line of\nworks over the past decade. In this paper, we finally close the gap for\napproximate-DP and provide a nearly tight upper bound of $\\tilde{O}(\\log^*\n|X|)$, which matches a lower bound by Alon et al (that applies even with\nimproper learning) and improves over a prior upper bound of $\\tilde{O}((\\log^*\n|X|)^{1.5})$ by Kaplan et al.

In this paper, we seek to address the dual\nconcerns of emphasising high resource languages for emoji prediction and\nrisking the privacy of people's data. We introduce a new dataset of $118$k\ntweets (augmented from $25$k unique tweets) for emoji prediction in Hindi, and\npropose a modification to the federated learning algorithm, CausalFedGSD, which\naims to strike a balance between model performance and user privacy.

There is an abundance of explanation techniques in\nliterature to address this need. Recently, it has been shown that a user is\nlikely to have multiple explanation needs that should be addressed by a\nconstellation of explanation techniques which we refer to as an explanation\nstrategy. This paper focuses on how users interact with an XAI system to fulfil\nthese multiple explanation needs satisfied by an explanation strategy. For this\npurpose, the paper introduces the concept of an \"explanation experience\" - as\nepisodes of user interactions captured by the XAI system when explaining the\ndecisions made by its AI system. In this paper, we explore how to enable and\ncapture explanation experiences through conversational interactions. We model\nthe interactive explanation experience as a dialogue model. Specifically,\nBehaviour Trees (BT) are used to model conversational pathways and chatbot\nbehaviours. A BT dialogue model is easily personalised by dynamically extending\nor modifying it to attend to different user needs and explanation strategies.\nAn evaluation with a real-world use case shows that BTs have a number of\nproperties that lend naturally to modelling and capturing explanation\nexperiences; as compared to traditionally used state transition models.",

To overcome this problem, we propose a novel method for paired\nNIR-VIS facial image generation. Specifically, we reconstruct 3D face shape and\nreflectance from a large 2D facial dataset and introduce a novel method of\ntransforming the VIS reflectance to NIR reflectance. We then use a\nphysically-based renderer to generate a vast, high-resolution and\nphotorealistic dataset consisting of various poses and identities in the NIR\nand VIS spectra. Moreover, to facilitate the identity feature learning, we\npropose an IDentity-based Maximum Mean Discrepancy (ID-MMD) loss, which not\nonly reduces the modality gap between NIR and VIS images at the domain level\nbut encourages the network to focus on the identity features instead of facial\ndetails, such as poses and accessories. Extensive experiments conducted on four\nchallenging NIR-VIS face recognition benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod can achieve comparable performance with the state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nmethods without requiring any existing NIR-VIS face recognition datasets.

Despite\nthe potential, their developments have been hampered by the elevated cost of\noptimizations and difficulty in realizations. Here, we propose a quantum neural\nnetwork in the form of fermion models whose physical properties, such as the\nlocal density of states and conditional conductance, serve as outputs, and\nestablish an efficient optimization comparable to back-propagation. In addition\nto competitive accuracy on challenging classical machine-learning benchmarks,\nour fermion quantum neural network performs machine learning on quantum systems\nwith high precision and without preprocessing. The quantum nature also brings\nvarious other advantages, e.g., quantum correlations entitle networks with more\ngeneral and local connectivity facilitating numerical simulations and\nexperimental realizations, as well as novel perspectives to address the\nvanishing gradient problem long plaguing deep networks. We also demonstrate the\napplications of our quantum toolbox, such as quantum-entanglement analysis, for\ninterpretable machine learning, including training dynamics, decision logic\nflow, and criteria formulation.",

    "abstract": "Animals can move reliably in unpredictable environments. The study of\nsensorimotor control has assumed that sensory information from the environment\nleads to actions, which then act back on the environment, creating a single,\nunidirectional perception-action loop. This loop contains internal delays in\nsensory and motor pathways, which can lead to unstable control. We show here\nthat these delays can be compensated by internal feedback signals that flow\nbackwards, which are ubiquitous in neural sensorimotor systems. Recent advances\nin control theory show that internal feedback plays a key role in compensating\ninternal delays. Based on these theoretical advances, we use a basic,\nmathematically tractable control model to show that internal feedback has an\nindispensable role in state estimation, can explain localization of function --\nwhy different parts of cortex control different parts of the body -- and how\nattention can improve motor performance, all of which are crucial for effective\nsensorimotor control. Control theory can explain anatomical, physiological and\nbehavioral observations, including motor signals in visual cortex,\nheterogeneous kinetics of sensory receptors and the presence of giant Betz\ncells in motor cortex.",

Here, instead of altering the\ncommunication graph, we investigate two methods that use buffered states to\naccelerate reaching average consensus over a given graph. In the first method,\nwe study how convergence rate of the well-known first-order Laplacian average\nconsensus algorithm changes when agreement feedback is generated from buffered\nstates. For this study, we obtain a sufficient condition on the ranges of\nbuffered state that leads to faster convergence. In the second proposed method,\nwe show how the average consensus problem can be cast as a convex optimization\nproblem and solved by first-order accelerated optimization algorithms for\nstrongly-convex cost functions. We construct an accelerated average consensus\nalgorithm using the so-called Triple Momentum optimization algorithm.

The next-generation large scale sky imaging surveys are expected\nto discover thousands of cluster-scale strong lenses, which would lead to\nunprecedented opportunities for applying cluster-scale strong lenses to solve\nastrophysical and cosmological problems. However, the large dataset challenges\nastronomers to identify and extract strong lensing signals, particularly\nstrongly lensed arcs, because of their complexity and variety. Hence, we\npropose a framework to detect cluster-scale strongly lensed arcs, which\ncontains a transformer-based detection algorithm and an image simulation\nalgorithm. We embed prior information of strongly lensed arcs at cluster-scale\ninto the training data through simulation and then train the detection\nalgorithm with simulated images. We use the trained transformer to detect\nstrongly lensed arcs from simulated and real data. Results show that our\napproach could achieve 99.63 % accuracy rate, 90.32 % recall rate, 85.37 %\nprecision rate and 0.23 % false positive rate in detection of strongly lensed\narcs from simulated images and could detect almost all strongly lensed arcs in\nreal observation images. Besides, with an interpretation method, we have shown\nthat our method could identify important information embedded in simulated\ndata. Next step, to test the reliability and usability of our approach, we will\napply it to available observations (e.g., DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys) and\nsimulated data of upcoming large-scale sky surveys, such as the Euclid and the\nCSST.",

    "title": "Joint Spatio-Temporal Precoding for Practical Non-Stationary Wireless  Channels",
    "abstract": "The high mobility, density and multi-path evident in modern wireless systems\nmakes the channel highly non-stationary. This causes temporal variation in the\nchannel distribution that leads to the existence of time-varying joint\ninterference across multiple degrees of freedom (DoF, e.g., users, antennas,\nfrequency and symbols), which renders conventional precoding sub-optimal in\npractice. In this work, we derive a High-Order Generalization of Mercer's\nTheorem (HOGMT), which decomposes the multi-user non-stationary channel into\ntwo (dual) sets of jointly orthogonal subchannels (eigenfunctions), that result\nin the other set when one set is transmitted through the channel. This duality\nand joint orthogonality of eigenfuntions ensure transmission over independently\nflat-fading subchannels. Consequently, transmitting these eigenfunctions with\noptimally derived coefficients eventually mitigates any interference across its\ndegrees of freedoms and forms the foundation of the proposed joint\nspatio-temporal precoding. The transferred dual eigenfuntions and coefficients\ndirectly reconstruct the data symbols at the receiver upon demodulation,\nthereby significantly reducing its computational burden, by alleviating the\nneed for any complementary post-coding. Additionally, the eigenfunctions\ndecomposed from the time-frequency delay-Doppler channel kernel are paramount\nto extracting the second-order channel statistics, and therefore completely\ncharacterize the underlying channel. We evaluate this using a realistic\nnon-stationary channel framework built in Matlab and show that our precoding\nachieves ${\\geqslant}$4 orders of reduction in BER at SNR${\\geqslant}15$dB in\nOFDM systems for higher-order modulations and less complexity compared to the\nstate-of-the-art precoding.",

However, the motivations of Bayesian inference which\nclaim it to be the only 'rational' kind of reasoning do not apply in practice.\nThey create a binary split in which all approximate inference is equally\n'irrational'. Instead, we should ask ourselves how to define a spectrum of\nmore- and less-rational reasoning that explains why we might prefer one\nBayesian approximation to another. I explore approximate inference in Bayesian\nneural networks and consider the unintended interactions between the\nprobabilistic model, approximating distribution, optimization algorithm, and\ndataset. The complexity of these interactions highlights the difficulty of any\nstrategy for evaluating Bayesian approximations which focuses entirely on the\nmethod, outside the context of specific datasets and decision-problems. For\ngiven applications, the expected utility of the approximate posterior can\nmeasure inference quality. To assess a model's ability to incorporate different\nparts of the Bayesian framework we can identify desirable characteristic\nbehaviours of Bayesian reasoning and pick decision-problems that make heavy use\nof those behaviours. Here, we use continual learning (testing the ability to\nupdate sequentially) and active learning (testing the ability to represent\ncredence).

    "abstract": "Tumor segmentation in histopathology images is often complicated by its\ncomposition of different histological subtypes and class imbalance.\nOversampling subtypes with low prevalence features is not a satisfactory\nsolution since it eventually leads to overfitting. We propose to create\nsynthetic images with semantically-conditioned deep generative networks and to\ncombine subtype-balanced synthetic images with the original dataset to achieve\nbetter segmentation performance. We show the suitability of Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GANs) and especially diffusion models to create realistic\nimages based on subtype-conditioning for the use case of HER2-stained\nhistopathology. Additionally, we show the capability of diffusion models to\nconditionally inpaint HER2 tumor areas with modified subtypes. Combining the\noriginal dataset with the same amount of diffusion-generated images increased\nthe tumor Dice score from 0.833 to 0.854 and almost halved the variance between\nthe HER2 subtype recalls. These results create the basis for more reliable\nautomatic HER2 analysis with lower performance variance between individual HER2\nsubtypes.",

    "title": "Continuous Emotional Intensity Controllable Speech Synthesis using  Semi-supervised Learning",
    "abstract": "With the rapid development of the speech synthesis system, recent\ntext-to-speech models have reached the level of generating natural speech\nsimilar to what humans say. But there still have limitations in terms of\nexpressiveness. In particular, the existing emotional speech synthesis models\nhave shown controllability using interpolated features with scaling parameters\nin emotional latent space. However, the emotional latent space generated from\nthe existing models is difficult to control the continuous emotional intensity\nbecause of the entanglement of features like emotions, speakers, etc. In this\npaper, we propose a novel method to control the continuous intensity of\nemotions using semi-supervised learning. The model learns emotions of\nintermediate intensity using pseudo-labels generated from phoneme-level\nsequences of speech information. An embedding space built from the proposed\nmodel satisfies the uniform grid geometry with an emotional basis. In addition,\nto improve the naturalness of intermediate emotional speech, a discriminator is\napplied to the generation of low-level elements like duration, pitch and\nenergy. The experimental results showed that the proposed method was superior\nin controllability and naturalness. The synthesized speech samples are\navailable at https://tinyurl.com/34zaehh2",

    "abstract": "Chest X-ray (CXR) datasets hosted on Kaggle, though useful from a data\nscience competition standpoint, have limited utility in clinical use because of\ntheir narrow focus on diagnosing one specific disease. In real-world clinical\nuse, multiple diseases need to be considered since they can co-exist in the\nsame patient. In this work, we demonstrate how federated learning (FL) can be\nused to make these toy CXR datasets from Kaggle clinically useful.\nSpecifically, we train a single FL classification model (`global`) using two\nseparate CXR datasets -- one annotated for presence of pneumonia and the other\nfor presence of pneumothorax (two common and life-threatening conditions) --\ncapable of diagnosing both. We compare the performance of the global FL model\nwith models trained separately on both datasets (`baseline`) for two different\nmodel architectures. On a standard, naive 3-layer CNN architecture, the global\nFL model achieved AUROC of 0.84 and 0.81 for pneumonia and pneumothorax,\nrespectively, compared to 0.85 and 0.82, respectively, for both baseline models\n(p>0.05). Similarly, on a pretrained DenseNet121 architecture, the global FL\nmodel achieved AUROC of 0.88 and 0.91 for pneumonia and pneumothorax,\nrespectively, compared to 0.89 and 0.91, respectively, for both baseline models\n(p>0.05). Our results suggest that FL can be used to create global `meta`\nmodels to make toy datasets from Kaggle clinically useful, a step forward\ntowards bridging the gap from bench to bedside.",

    "abstract": "The selection of an optimal pacing site, which is ideally scar-free and late\nactivated, is critical to the response of cardiac resynchronization therapy\n(CRT). Despite the success of current approaches formulating the detection of\nsuch late mechanical activation (LMA) regions as a problem of activation time\nregression, their accuracy remains unsatisfactory, particularly in cases where\nmyocardial scar exists. To address this issue, this paper introduces a\nmulti-task deep learning framework that simultaneously estimates LMA amount and\nclassify the scar-free LMA regions based on cine displacement encoding with\nstimulated echoes (DENSE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). With a newly\nintroduced auxiliary LMA region classification sub-network, our proposed model\nshows more robustness to the complex pattern cause by myocardial scar,\nsignificantly eliminates their negative effects in LMA detection, and in turn\nimproves the performance of scar classification. To evaluate the effectiveness\nof our method, we tests our model on real cardiac MR images and compare the\npredicted LMA with the state-of-the-art approaches. It shows that our approach\nachieves substantially increased accuracy. In addition, we employ the\ngradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) to visualize the feature\nmaps learned by all methods. Experimental results suggest that our proposed\nmodel better recognizes the LMA region pattern.",
