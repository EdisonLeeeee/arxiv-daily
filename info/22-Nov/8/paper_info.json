    "abstract": "Online damage quantification suffers from insufficient labeled data. In this\ncontext, adopting the domain adaptation on historical labeled data from similar\nstructures/damages to assist the current diagnosis task would be beneficial.\nHowever, most domain adaptation methods are designed for classification and\ncannot efficiently address damage quantification, a regression problem with\ncontinuous real-valued labels. This study first proposes a novel domain\nadaptation method, the Online Fuzzy-set-based Joint Distribution Adaptation for\nRegression, to address this challenge. By converting the continuous real-valued\nlabels to fuzzy class labels via fuzzy sets, the conditional distribution\ndiscrepancy is measured, and domain adaptation can simultaneously consider the\nmarginal and conditional distribution for the regression task. Furthermore, a\nframework of online damage quantification integrated with the proposed domain\nadaptation method is presented. The method has been verified with an example of\na damaged helicopter panel, in which domain adaptations are conducted across\ndifferent damage locations and from simulation to experiment, proving the\naccuracy of damage quantification can be improved significantly even in a noisy\nenvironment. It is expected that the proposed approach to be applied to the\nfleet-level digital twin considering the individual differences.",

    "title": "Dealing with Drift of Adaptation Spaces in Learning-based Self-Adaptive  Systems using Lifelong Self-Adaptation",
    "abstract": "Recently, machine learning (ML) has become a popular approach to support\nself-adaptation. ML has been used to deal with several problems in\nself-adaptation, such as maintaining an up-to-date runtime model under\nuncertainty and scalable decision-making. Yet, exploiting ML comes with\ninherent challenges. In this paper, we focus on a particularly important\nchallenge for learning-based self-adaptive systems: drift in adaptation spaces.\nWith adaptation space we refer to the set of adaptation options a self-adaptive\nsystem can select from at a given time to adapt based on the estimated quality\nproperties of the adaptation options. Drift of adaptation spaces originates\nfrom uncertainties, affecting the quality properties of the adaptation options.\nSuch drift may imply that eventually no adaptation option can satisfy the\ninitial set of the adaptation goals, deteriorating the quality of the system,\nor adaptation options may emerge that allow enhancing the adaptation goals. In\nML, such shift corresponds to novel class appearance, a type of concept drift\nin target data that common ML techniques have problems dealing with. To tackle\nthis problem, we present a novel approach to self-adaptation that enhances\nlearning-based self-adaptive systems with a lifelong ML layer. We refer to this\napproach as lifelong self-adaptation. The lifelong ML layer tracks the system\nand its environment, associates this knowledge with the current tasks,\nidentifies new tasks based on differences, and updates the learning models of\nthe self-adaptive system accordingly. A human stakeholder may be involved to\nsupport the learning process and adjust the learning and goal models. We\npresent a reusable architecture for lifelong self-adaptation and apply it to\nthe case of drift of adaptation spaces that affects the decision-making in\nself-adaptation. We validate the approach for a series of scenarios using the\nDeltaIoT exemplar.",

    "abstract": "Standard imitation learning can fail when the expert demonstrators have\ndifferent sensory inputs than the imitating agent. This is because partial\nobservability gives rise to hidden confounders in the causal graph. We break\ndown the space of confounded imitation learning problems and identify three\nsettings with different data requirements in which the correct imitation policy\ncan be identified. We then introduce an algorithm for deconfounded imitation\nlearning, which trains an inference model jointly with a latent-conditional\npolicy. At test time, the agent alternates between updating its belief over the\nlatent and acting under the belief. We show in theory and practice that this\nalgorithm converges to the correct interventional policy, solves the\nconfounding issue, and can under certain assumptions achieve an asymptotically\noptimal imitation performance.",

    "abstract": "In a modern power system with an increasing proportion of renewable energy,\nwind power prediction is crucial to the arrangement of power grid dispatching\nplans due to the volatility of wind power. However, traditional centralized\nforecasting methods raise concerns regarding data privacy-preserving and data\nislands problem. To handle the data privacy and openness, we propose a\nforecasting scheme that combines federated learning and deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL) for ultra-short-term wind power forecasting, called federated\ndeep reinforcement learning (FedDRL). Firstly, this paper uses the deep\ndeterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm as the basic forecasting model\nto improve prediction accuracy. Secondly, we integrate the DDPG forecasting\nmodel into the framework of federated learning. The designed FedDRL can obtain\nan accurate prediction model in a decentralized way by sharing model parameters\ninstead of sharing private data which can avoid sensitive privacy issues. The\nsimulation results show that the proposed FedDRL outperforms the traditional\nprediction methods in terms of forecasting accuracy. More importantly, while\nensuring the forecasting performance, FedDRL can effectively protect the data\nprivacy and relieve the communication pressure compared with the traditional\ncentralized forecasting method. In addition, a simulation with different\nfederated learning parameters is conducted to confirm the robustness of the\nproposed scheme.",

While in its basic forms the problem has been studied\nextensively and efficient algorithms are known, it becomes significantly harder\nas soon as parts of the graph are susceptible to failure. Although one can\nrecompute a shortest replacement path after every outage, this is rather\ninefficient both in time and/or storage. One way to overcome this problem is to\nshift computational burden from the queries into a pre-processing step, where a\ndata structure is computed that allows for fast querying of replacement paths,\ntypically referred to as a Distance Sensitivity Oracle (DSO). While DSOs have\nbeen extensively studied in the theoretical computer science community, to the\nbest of our knowledge this is the first work to construct DSOs using deep\nlearning techniques. We show how to use deep learning to utilize a\ncombinatorial structure of replacement paths.

    "abstract": "When training early-stage deep neural networks (DNNs), generating\nintermediate features via convolution or linear layers occupied most of the\nexecution time. Accordingly, extensive research has been done to reduce the\ncomputational burden of the convolution or linear layers. In recent\nmobile-friendly DNNs, however, the relative number of operations involved in\nprocessing these layers has significantly reduced. As a result, the proportion\nof the execution time of other layers, such as batch normalization layers, has\nincreased. Thus, in this work, we conduct a detailed analysis of the batch\nnormalization layer to efficiently reduce the runtime overhead in the batch\nnormalization process. Backed up by the thorough analysis, we present an\nextremely efficient batch normalization, named LightNorm, and its associated\nhardware module. In more detail, we fuse three approximation techniques that\nare i) low bit-precision, ii) range batch normalization, and iii) block\nfloating point. All these approximate techniques are carefully utilized not\nonly to maintain the statistics of intermediate feature maps, but also to\nminimize the off-chip memory accesses. By using the proposed LightNorm\nhardware, we can achieve significant area and energy savings during the DNN\ntraining without hurting the training accuracy. This makes the proposed\nhardware a great candidate for the on-device training.",

    "abstract": "We consider the classic online learning and stochastic multi-armed bandit\n(MAB) problems, when at each step, the online policy can probe and find out\nwhich of a small number ($k$) of choices has better reward (or loss) before\nmaking its choice. In this model, we derive algorithms whose regret bounds have\nexponentially better dependence on the time horizon compared to the classic\nregret bounds. In particular, we show that probing with $k=2$ suffices to\nachieve time-independent regret bounds for online linear and convex\noptimization. The same number of probes improve the regret bound of stochastic\nMAB with independent arms from $O(\\sqrt{nT})$ to $O(n^2 \\log T)$, where $n$ is\nthe number of arms and $T$ is the horizon length. For stochastic MAB, we also\nconsider a stronger model where a probe reveals the reward values of the probed\narms, and show that in this case, $k=3$ probes suffice to achieve\nparameter-independent constant regret, $O(n^2)$. Such regret bounds cannot be\nachieved even with full feedback after the play, showcasing the power of\nlimited ``advice'' via probing before making the play. We also present\nextensions to the setting where the hints can be imperfect, and to the case of\nstochastic MAB where the rewards of the arms can be correlated.",

Existing image inpainting based foreground\ngeneration methods often struggle to generate diverse results and rarely allow\nusers to explicitly control specific factors of variation (e.g., varying the\nfacial identity or expression for face inpainting results). We leverage\ncontrastive learning with latent codes to generate diverse foreground results\nfor the same masked input. Specifically, we define two sets of latent codes,\nwhere one controls a pre-defined factor (``known''), and the other controls the\nremaining factors (``unknown'').

    "abstract": "A software requirement specification (SRS) document is an essential part of\nthe software development life cycle which outlines the requirements that a\nsoftware program in development must satisfy. This document is often specified\nby a diverse group of stakeholders and is subject to continual change, making\nthe process of maintaining the document and detecting conflicts between\nrequirements an essential task in software development. Notably, projects that\ndo not address conflicts in the SRS document early on face considerable\nproblems later in the development life cycle. These problems incur substantial\ncosts in terms of time and money, and these costs often become insurmountable\nbarriers that ultimately result in the termination of a software project\naltogether. As a result, early detection of SRS conflicts is critical to\nproject sustainability. The conflict detection task is approached in numerous\nways, many of which require a significant amount of manual intervention from\ndevelopers, or require access to a large amount of labeled, task-specific\ntraining data. In this work, we propose using a prompt-based learning approach\nto perform few-shot learning for conflict detection. We compare our results to\nsupervised learning approaches that use pretrained language models, such as\nBERT and its variants. Our results show that prompting with just 32 labeled\nexamples can achieve a similar level of performance in many key metrics to that\nof supervised learning on training sets that are magnitudes larger in size. In\ncontrast to many other conflict detection approaches, we make no assumptions\nabout the type of underlying requirements, allowing us to analyze pairings of\nboth functional and non-functional requirements.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised pre-training of a speech foundation model, followed by\nsupervised fine-tuning, has shown impressive quality improvements on automatic\nspeech recognition (ASR) tasks. Fine-tuning separate foundation models for many\ndownstream tasks are expensive since the foundation model is usually very big.\nParameter-efficient fine-tuning methods (e.g. adapter, sparse update methods)\noffer an alternative paradigm where a small set of parameters are updated to\nadapt the foundation model to new tasks. However, these methods still suffer\nfrom a high computational memory cost and slow training speed because they\nrequire backpropagation through the entire neural network at each step. In the\npaper, we analyze the performance of features at different layers of a\nfoundation model on the speech recognition task and propose a novel\nhierarchical feature fusion method for resource-efficient transfer learning\nfrom speech foundation models. Experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod can achieve better performance on speech recognition task than existing\nalgorithms with fewer number of trainable parameters, less computational memory\ncost and faster training speed.

    "abstract": "We initiate a systematic study of approximation schemes for fundamental\noptimization problems on disk graphs, a common generalization of both planar\ngraphs and unit-disk graphs. Our main contribution is a general framework for\ndesigning efficient polynomial-time approximation schemes (EPTASes) for\nvertex-deletion problems on disk graphs, which results in EPTASes for many\nproblems including Vertex Cover, Feedback Vertex Set, Small Cycle Hitting (in\nparticular, Triangle Hitting), $P_k$-Hitting for $k\\in\\{3,4,5\\}$, Path\nDeletion, Pathwidth $1$-Deletion, Component Order Connectivity, Bounded Degree\nDeletion, Pseudoforest Deletion, Finite-Type Component Deletion, etc. All\nEPTASes obtained using our framework are robust in the sense that they do not\nrequire a realization of the input graph. To the best of our knowledge, prior\nto this work, the only problems known to admit (E)PTASes on disk graphs are\nMaximum Clique, Independent Set, Dominating set, and Vertex Cover, among which\nthe existing PTAS [Erlebach et al., SICOMP'05] and EPTAS [Leeuwen, SWAT'06] for\nVertex Cover require a realization of the input disk graph (while ours does\nnot).\nThe core of our framework is a reduction for a broad class of (approximation)\nvertex-deletion problems from (general) disk graphs to disk graphs of bounded\nlocal radius, which is a new invariant of disk graphs introduced in this work.\nDisk graphs of bounded local radius can be viewed as a mild generalization of\nplanar graphs, which preserves certain nice properties of planar graphs.\nSpecifically, we prove that disk graphs of bounded local radius admit the\nExcluded Grid Minor property and have locally bounded treewidth. This allows\nexisting techniques for designing approximation schemes on planar graphs (e.g.,\nbidimensionality and Baker's technique) to be directly applied to disk graphs\nof bounded local radius.",

    "abstract": "Many empirical studies suggest that samples of continuous-time signals taken\nat locations randomly deviated from an equispaced grid (i.e., off-the-grid) can\nbenefit signal acquisition, e.g., undersampling and anti-aliasing. However,\nexplicit statements of such advantages and their respective conditions are\nscarce in the literature. This paper provides some insight on this topic when\nthe sampling positions are known, with grid deviations generated i.i.d. from a\nvariety of distributions. By solving the basis pursuit problem with an\ninterpolation kernel we demonstrate the capabilities of nonuniform samples for\ncompressive sampling, an effective paradigm for undersampling and\nanti-aliasing. For functions in the Wiener algebra that admit a discrete\n$s$-sparse representation in some transform domain, we show that\n$\\mathcal{O}(s\\log N)$ random off-the-grid samples are sufficient to recover an\naccurate $\\frac{N}{2}$-bandlimited approximation of the signal. For sparse\nsignals (i.e., $s \\ll N$), this sampling complexity is a great reduction in\ncomparison to equispaced sampling where $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ measurements are\nneeded for the same quality of reconstruction (Nyquist-Shannon sampling\ntheorem). We further consider noise attenuation via oversampling (relative to a\ndesired bandwidth), a standard technique with limited theoretical understanding\nwhen the sampling positions are non-equispaced. By solving a least squares\nproblem, we show that $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$ i.i.d. randomly deviated samples\nprovide an accurate $\\frac{N}{2}$-bandlimited approximation of the signal with\nsuppression of the noise energy by a factor $\\sim\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\log N}}$.",

    "abstract": "The process of screening molecules for desirable properties is a key step in\nseveral applications, ranging from drug discovery to material design. During\nthe process of drug discovery specifically, protein-ligand docking, or chemical\ndocking, is a standard in-silico scoring technique that estimates the binding\naffinity of molecules with a specific protein target. Recently, however, as the\nnumber of virtual molecules available to test has rapidly grown, these\nclassical docking algorithms have created a significant computational\nbottleneck. We address this problem by introducing Deep Surrogate Docking\n(DSD), a framework that applies deep learning-based surrogate modeling to\naccelerate the docking process substantially. DSD can be interpreted as a\nformalism of several earlier surrogate prefiltering techniques, adding novel\nmetrics and practical training practices. Specifically, we show that graph\nneural networks (GNNs) can serve as fast and accurate estimators of classical\ndocking algorithms. Additionally, we introduce FiLMv2, a novel GNN architecture\nwhich we show outperforms existing state-of-the-art GNN architectures,\nattaining more accurate and stable performance by allowing the model to filter\nout irrelevant information from data more efficiently. Through extensive\nexperimentation and analysis, we show that the DSD workflow combined with the\nFiLMv2 architecture provides a 9.496x speedup in molecule screening with a <3%\nrecall error rate on an example docking task.

The benefits and drawbacks of lower layer mobility procedure are\nanalyzed and compared against higher layer handover mechanisms using the\nrelevant mobility key performance indicators. It has been shown that lower\nlayer mobility procedure outperforms the existing handover mechanisms with\nrespect to radio communication reliability at the expense of higher number of\nhandovers and ping-pongs. To tackle these drawbacks, additional filtering for\nthe L1 measurements used in handover decision is introduced to reduce the\nfluctuations caused by fast fading and measurement errors.

Existing methods leverage\nsimulation-based testing (or falsification) to find the failures of\nvision-based controllers, i.e., the visual inputs that lead to closed-loop\nsafety violations. However, these techniques do not scale well to the scenarios\ninvolving high-dimensional and complex visual inputs, such as RGB images. In\nthis work, we cast the problem of finding closed-loop vision failures as a\nHamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability problem. Our approach blends simulation-based\nanalysis with HJ reachability methods to compute an approximation of the\nbackward reachable tube (BRT) of the system, i.e., the set of unsafe states for\nthe system under vision-based controllers. Utilizing the BRT, we can tractably\nand systematically find the system states and corresponding visual inputs that\nlead to closed-loop failures. These visual inputs can be subsequently analyzed\nto find the input characteristics that might have caused the failure. Besides\nits scalability to high-dimensional visual inputs, an explicit computation of\nBRT allows the proposed approach to capture non-trivial system failures that\nare difficult to expose via random simulations.

Julia\nleverages a unified and coordinated single-language and ecosystem paradigm and\nhas a proven track record of achieving high performance without sacrificing\nuser productivity. These aspects make Julia a viable alternative to\nhigh-performance computing's (HPC's) existing and increasingly costly many-body\nworkflow composition strategy in which traditional HPC languages (e.g.,\nFortran, C, C++) are used for simulations, and higher-level languages (e.g.,\nPython, R, MATLAB) are used for data analysis and interactive computing.\nJulia's rapid growth in language capabilities, package ecosystem, and community\nmake it a promising universal language for HPC. This paper presents the views\nof a multidisciplinary group of researchers from academia, government, and\nindustry that advocate for an HPC software development paradigm that emphasizes\ndeveloper productivity, workflow portability, and low barriers for entry. We\nbelieve that the Julia programming language, its ecosystem, and its community\nprovide modern and powerful capabilities that enable this group's objectives.\nCrucially, we believe that Julia can provide a feasible and less costly\napproach to programming scientific applications and workflows that target HPC\nfacilities. In this work, we examine the current practice and role of Julia as\na common, end-to-end programming model to address major challenges in\nscientific reproducibility, data-driven AI/machine learning, co-design and\nworkflows, scalability and performance portability in heterogeneous computing,\nnetwork communication, data management, and community education. As a result,\nthe diversification of current investments to fulfill the needs of the upcoming\ndecade is crucial as more supercomputing centers prepare for the exascale era.",

    "abstract": "The ability of knowledge graphs to represent complex relationships at scale\nhas led to their adoption for various needs including knowledge representation,\nquestion-answering, fraud detection, and recommendation systems. Knowledge\ngraphs are often incomplete in the information they represent, necessitating\nthe need for knowledge graph completion tasks, such as link and relation\nprediction. Pre-trained and fine-tuned language models have shown promise in\nthese tasks although these models ignore the intrinsic information encoded in\nthe knowledge graph, namely the entity and relation types. In this work, we\npropose the Knowledge Graph Language Model (KGLM) architecture, where we\nintroduce a new entity/relation embedding layer that learns to differentiate\ndistinctive entity and relation types, therefore allowing the model to learn\nthe structure of the knowledge graph. In this work, we show that further\npre-training the language models with this additional embedding layer using the\ntriples extracted from the knowledge graph, followed by the standard\nfine-tuning phase sets a new state-of-the-art performance for the link\nprediction task on the benchmark datasets.",

In this paper, we make the case that it is time to do\nthe same for AI -- but with a twist!

This allows us\nto: (1) support multi-modal data processing such as images, videos, audio, text\nas well as relational; (2) leverage the wellspring of innovation in HW and\nruntimes for tensor computation; and (3) exploit automatic differentiation to\nenable a novel class of \"trainable\" queries that can learn to perform a task.\nTo support the above scenarios, we introduce TDP: a system that builds upon\nour prior work mapping relational queries to tensors. Thanks to a tighter\nintegration with the tensor runtime, TDP is able to provide a broader coverage\nof new emerging scenarios requiring access to multi-modal data and automatic\ndifferentiation.",

Building a generic representation that can be used\nacross different environments and tasks is not easy, as the relevant objects\nvary depending on the environment and the task. Furthermore, another challenge\narises in agro-food environments due to their complexity, and high levels of\nclutter and occlusions. In this paper, we present a method to build generic\nrepresentations in highly occluded agro-food environments using multi-view\nperception and 3D multi-object tracking. Our representation is built upon a\ndetection algorithm that generates a partial point cloud for each detected\nobject.

We evaluated the accuracy of the\nrepresentation on a real-world agro-food environment, where it was able to\nsuccessfully represent and locate tomatoes in tomato plants despite a high\nlevel of occlusion. We were able to estimate the total count of tomatoes with a\nmaximum error of 5.08% and to track tomatoes with a tracking accuracy up to\n71.47%.

    "abstract": "Multiserver-job systems, where jobs require concurrent service at many\nservers, occur widely in practice. Essentially all of the theoretical work on\nmultiserver-job systems focuses on maximizing utilization, with almost nothing\nknown about mean response time. In simpler settings, such as various known-size\nsingle-server-job settings, minimizing mean response time is merely a matter of\nprioritizing small jobs. However, for the multiserver-job system, prioritizing\nsmall jobs is not enough, because we must also ensure servers are not\nunnecessarily left idle. Thus, minimizing mean response time requires\nprioritizing small jobs while simultaneously maximizing throughput. Our\nquestion is how to achieve these joint objectives.\nWe devise the ServerFilling-SRPT scheduling policy, which is the first policy\nto minimize mean response time in the multiserver-job model in the heavy\ntraffic limit. In addition to proving this heavy-traffic result, we present\nempirical evidence that ServerFilling-SRPT outperforms all existing scheduling\npolicies for all loads, with improvements by orders of magnitude at higher\nloads.\nBecause ServerFilling-SRPT requires knowing job sizes, we also define the\nServerFilling-Gittins policy, which is optimal when sizes are unknown or\npartially known.",

By taking a Bayesian approach,\nit is possible to reason about the uncertainty of the causal model.

In this paper, we introduce a novel method\nto jointly learn the structure and mechanisms of the causal model using\nVariational Bayes, which we call Variational Bayes-DAG-GFlowNet (VBG).

    "abstract": "Recently, Neural architecture search has achieved great success on\nclassification tasks for mobile devices. The backbone network for object\ndetection is usually obtained on the image classification task. However, the\narchitecture which is searched through the classification task is sub-optimal\nbecause of the gap between the task of image and object detection. As while\nwork focuses on backbone network architecture search for mobile device object\ndetection is limited, mainly because the backbone always requires expensive\nImageNet pre-training. Accordingly, it is necessary to study the approach of\nnetwork architecture search for mobile device object detection without\nexpensive pre-training. In this work, we propose a mobile object detection\nbackbone network architecture search algorithm which is a kind of evolutionary\noptimized method based on non-dominated sorting for NAS scenarios. It can\nquickly search to obtain the backbone network architecture within certain\nconstraints. It better solves the problem of suboptimal linear combination\naccuracy and computational cost. The proposed approach can search the backbone\nnetworks with different depths, widths, or expansion sizes via a technique of\nweight mapping, making it possible to use NAS for mobile devices detection\ntasks a lot more efficiently. In our experiments, we verify the effectiveness\nof the proposed approach on YoloX-Lite, a lightweight version of the target\ndetection framework. Under similar computational complexity, the accuracy of\nthe backbone network architecture we search for is 2.0% mAP higher than\nMobileDet. Our improved backbone network can reduce the computational effort\nwhile improving the accuracy of the object detection network.

    "abstract": "We present ResilienC, a framework for resilient control of Cyber-Physical\nSystems subject to STL-based requirements. ResilienC utilizes a recently\ndeveloped formalism for specifying CPS resiliency in terms of sets of\n$(\\mathit{rec},\\mathit{dur})$ real-valued pairs, where $\\mathit{rec}$\nrepresents the system's capability to rapidly recover from a property violation\n(recoverability), and $\\mathit{dur}$ is reflective of its ability to avoid\nviolations post-recovery (durability). We define the resilient STL control\nproblem as one of multi-objective optimization, where the recoverability and\ndurability of the desired STL specification are maximized. When neither\nobjective is prioritized over the other, the solution to the problem is a set\nof Pareto-optimal system trajectories. We present a precise solution method to\nthe resilient STL control problem using a mixed-integer linear programming\nencoding and an a posteriori $\\epsilon$-constraint approach for efficiently\nretrieving the complete set of optimally resilient solutions. In ResilienC, at\neach time-step, the optimal control action selected from the set of\nPareto-optimal solutions by a Decision Maker strategy realizes a form of Model\nPredictive Control. We demonstrate the practical utility of the ResilienC\nframework on two significant case studies: autonomous vehicle lane keeping and\ndeadline-driven, multi-region package delivery.",

    "abstract": "Multiview self-supervised representation learning roots in exploring semantic\nconsistency across data of complex intra-class variation. Such variation is not\ndirectly accessible and therefore simulated by data augmentations. However,\ncommonly adopted augmentations are handcrafted and limited to simple\ngeometrical and color changes, which are unable to cover the abundant\nintra-class variation. In this paper, we propose to extract the underlying data\nvariation from datasets and construct a novel augmentation operator, named\nlocal manifold augmentation (LMA). LMA is achieved by training an\ninstance-conditioned generator to fit the distribution on the local manifold of\ndata and sampling multiview data using it. LMA shows the ability to create an\ninfinite number of data views, preserve semantics, and simulate complicated\nvariations in object pose, viewpoint, lighting condition, background etc.\nExperiments show that with LMA integrated, self-supervised learning methods\nsuch as MoCov2 and SimSiam gain consistent improvement on prevalent benchmarks\nincluding CIFAR10, CIFAR100, STL10, ImageNet100, and ImageNet. Furthermore, LMA\nleads to representations that obtain more significant invariance to the\nviewpoint, object pose, and illumination changes and stronger robustness to\nvarious real distribution shifts reflected by ImageNet-V2, ImageNet-R, ImageNet\nSketch etc.",

In this paper, we propose a new\nregistration method, KSS-ICP, to address the rigid registration task in Kendall\nshape space (KSS) with Iterative Closest Point (ICP). The KSS is a quotient\nspace that removes influences of translations, scales, and rotations for shape\nfeature-based analysis. Such influences can be concluded as the similarity\ntransformations that do not change the shape feature. The point cloud\nrepresentation in KSS is invariant to similarity transformations. We utilize\nsuch property to design the KSS-ICP for point cloud registration. To tackle the\ndifficulty to achieve the KSS representation in general, the proposed KSS-ICP\nformulates a practical solution that does not require complex feature analysis,\ndata training, and optimization. With a simple implementation, KSS-ICP achieves\nmore accurate registration from point clouds. It is robust to similarity\ntransformation, non-uniform density, noise, and defective parts.

    "abstract": "Fact verification has attracted a lot of research attention recently, e.g.,\nin journalism, marketing, and policymaking, as misinformation and\ndisinformation online can sway one's opinion and affect one's actions. While\nfact-checking is a hard task in general, in many cases, false statements can be\neasily debunked based on analytics over tables with reliable information.\nHence, table-based fact verification has recently emerged as an important and\ngrowing research area. Yet, progress has been limited due to the lack of\ndatasets that can be used to pre-train language models (LMs) to be aware of\ncommon table operations, such as aggregating a column or comparing tuples. To\nbridge this gap, in this paper we introduce PASTA, a novel state-of-the-art\nframework for table-based fact verification via pre-training with synthesized\nsentence-table cloze questions. In particular, we design six types of common\nsentence-table cloze tasks, including Filter, Aggregation, Superlative,\nComparative, Ordinal, and Unique, based on which we synthesize a large corpus\nconsisting of 1.2 million sentence-table pairs from WikiTables. PASTA uses a\nrecent pre-trained LM, DeBERTaV3, and further pretrains it on our corpus. Our\nexperimental results show that PASTA achieves new state-of-the-art performance\non two table-based fact verification benchmarks: TabFact and SEM-TAB-FACTS. In\nparticular, on the complex set of TabFact, which contains multiple operations,\nPASTA largely outperforms the previous state of the art by 4.7 points (85.6%\nvs. 80.9%), and the gap between PASTA and human performance on the small\nTabFact test set is narrowed to just 1.5 points (90.6% vs. 92.1%).",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has brought significant breakthroughs in sequential\nrecommendation (SR) for capturing dynamic user interests. A series of recent\nresearch revealed that models with more parameters usually achieve optimal\nperformance for SR tasks, inevitably resulting in great challenges for\ndeploying them in real systems. Following the simple assumption that light\nnetworks might already suffice for certain users, in this work, we propose\nCANet, a conceptually simple yet very scalable framework for assigning adaptive\nnetwork architecture in an input-dependent manner to reduce unnecessary\ncomputation. The core idea of CANet is to route the input user behaviors with a\nlight-weighted router module. Specifically, we first construct the routing\nspace with various submodels parameterized in terms of multiple model\ndimensions such as the number of layers, hidden size and embedding size. To\navoid extra storage overhead of the routing space, we employ a weight-slicing\nschema to maintain all the submodels in exactly one network. Furthermore, we\nleverage several solutions to solve the discrete optimization issues caused by\nthe router module. Thanks to them, CANet could adaptively adjust its network\narchitecture for each input in an end-to-end manner, in which the user\npreference can be effectively captured. To evaluate our work, we conduct\nextensive experiments on benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that\nCANet reduces computation by 55 ~ 65% while preserving the accuracy of the\noriginal model. Our codes are available at\nhttps://github.com/icantnamemyself/CANet.",

Learning approaches stand out as\npromising for this domain as they allow us to learn behaviours directly from\ndata. Most prior methods however rely heavily on simulation, which is still\nlimited by the large sim-to-real gap of deformable objects or rely on large\ndatasets. A promising alternative is to learn fabric manipulation directly from\nwatching humans perform the task. In this work, we explore how demonstrations\nfor fabric manipulation tasks can be collected directly by human hands,\nproviding an extremely natural and fast data collection pipeline. Then, using\nonly a handful of such demonstrations, we show how a sample-efficient\npick-and-place policy can be learned and deployed on a real robot, without any\nrobot data collection at all. We demonstrate our approach on a fabric folding\ntask, showing that our policy can reliably reach folded states from crumpled\ninitial configurations.",

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with on-board cameras are widely used for\nremote surveillance and video capturing applications. In remote virtual reality\n(VR) applications, multiple UAVs can be used to capture different partially\noverlapping angles of the ground target, which can be stitched together to\nprovide 360{\\deg} views. This requires coordinated formation of UAVs that is\nadaptive to movements of the ground target. In this paper, we propose a joint\nUAV formation and tracking framework to capture 360{\\deg} angles of the target.\nThe proposed framework uses a zero touch approach for automated and adaptive\nreconfiguration of multiple UAVs in a coordinated manner without the need for\nhuman intervention. This is suited to both military and civilian applications.\nSimulation results demonstrate the convergence and configuration of the UAVs\nwith arbitrary initial locations and orientations. The performance has been\ntested for various number of UAVs and different mobility patterns of the ground\ntarget.",

    "abstract": "Semiconductor lasers, one of the key components for optical communication\nsystems, have been rapidly evolving to meet the requirements of next generation\noptical networks with respect to high speed, low power consumption, small form\nfactor etc. However, these demands have brought severe challenges to the\nsemiconductor laser reliability. Therefore, a great deal of attention has been\ndevoted to improving it and thereby ensuring reliable transmission. In this\npaper, a predictive maintenance framework using machine learning techniques is\nproposed for real-time heath monitoring and prognosis of semiconductor laser\nand thus enhancing its reliability. The proposed approach is composed of three\nstages: i) real-time performance degradation prediction, ii) degradation\ndetection, and iii) remaining useful life (RUL) prediction. First of all, an\nattention based gated recurrent unit (GRU) model is adopted for real-time\nprediction of performance degradation. Then, a convolutional autoencoder is\nused to detect the degradation or abnormal behavior of a laser, given the\npredicted degradation performance values. Once an abnormal state is detected, a\nRUL prediction model based on attention-based deep learning is utilized.\nAfterwards, the estimated RUL is input for decision making and maintenance\nplanning. The proposed framework is validated using experimental data derived\nfrom accelerated aging tests conducted for semiconductor tunable lasers. The\nproposed approach achieves a very good degradation performance prediction\ncapability with a small root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.01, a good anomaly\ndetection accuracy of 94.24% and a better RUL estimation capability compared to\nthe existing ML-based laser RUL prediction models.",

    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization on graphs is drawing widespread\nattention. However, existing efforts mainly focus on the OOD issue of\ncorrelation shift. While another type, covariate shift, remains largely\nunexplored but is the focus of this work. From a data generation view, causal\nfeatures are stable substructures in data, which play key roles in OOD\ngeneralization. While their complementary parts, environments, are unstable\nfeatures that often lead to various distribution shifts. Correlation shift\nestablishes spurious statistical correlations between environments and labels.\nIn contrast, covariate shift means that there exist unseen environmental\nfeatures in test data. Existing strategies of graph invariant learning and data\naugmentation suffer from limited environments or unstable causal features,\nwhich greatly limits their generalization ability on covariate shift. In view\nof that, we propose a novel graph augmentation strategy: Adversarial Causal\nAugmentation (AdvCA), to alleviate the covariate shift. Specifically, it\nadversarially augments the data to explore diverse distributions of the\nenvironments. Meanwhile, it keeps the causal features invariant across diverse\nenvironments. It maintains the environmental diversity while ensuring the\ninvariance of the causal features, thereby effectively alleviating the\ncovariate shift. Extensive experimental results with in-depth analyses\ndemonstrate that AdvCA can outperform 14 baselines on synthetic and real-world\ndatasets with various covariate shifts.",

    "abstract": "Semiconductor lasers have been rapidly evolving to meet the demands of\nnext-generation optical networks. This imposes much more stringent requirements\non the laser reliability, which are dominated by degradation mechanisms (e.g.,\nsudden degradation) limiting the semiconductor laser lifetime. Physics-based\napproaches are often used to characterize the degradation behavior\nanalytically, yet explicit domain knowledge and accurate mathematical models\nare required. Building such models can be very challenging due to a lack of a\nfull understanding of the complex physical processes inducing the degradation\nunder various operating conditions. To overcome the aforementioned limitations,\nwe propose a new data-driven approach, extracting useful insights from the\noperational monitored data to predict the degradation trend without requiring\nany specific knowledge or using any physical model. The proposed approach is\nbased on an unsupervised technique, a conditional variational autoencoder, and\nvalidated using vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) and tunable edge\nemitting laser reliability data. The experimental results confirm that our\nmodel (i) achieves a good degradation prediction and generalization performance\nby yielding an F1 score of 95.3%, (ii) outperforms several baseline ML based\nanomaly detection techniques, and (iii) helps to shorten the aging tests by\nearly predicting the failed devices before the end of the test and thereby\nsaving costs",

Near-optimal solutions can be solved with\nhigh computational efficiency by the proposed quasi-OPF. Unlike conventional\nOPF utilizing mathematical optimization algorithms, the proposed quasi-OPF\nadopts analytical mapping from load information to near-optimal solutions,\nhence considerably accelerating the computation. First, we study the mechanism\nand physical meaning interpretation of conventional OPF based on a new modeling\nmethod and successfully interpret the mechanism of conventional OPF in flexible\nDC TPSs. Then, the analytical mapping from load information to near-optimal\nsolutions is obtained inspired by the mechanism of conventional OPF, and the\nquasi-OPF algorithm is designed based on the mapping. Since the mapping is\nbased on simple arithmetic, the quasi-OPF algorithm can solve OPF with much\nless execution time, achieving subsecond level calculation and a speed-up of 57\ntimes compared to conventional OPF. The effectiveness is verified by\nmathematical proofs and a case study with Beijing Metro Line 13.

Our study's contribution is a\nmethodology for tackling missing data problems using a combination of synthetic\ndataset generation, missing data imputation and deep learning methods to\nresolve missing data challenges. Specifically, we conducted a series of\nexperiments with these objectives; $a)$ generating a realistic synthetic\ndataset, $b)$ simulating data missingness, $c)$ recovering the missing data,\nand $d)$ analyzing imputation performance. Our methodology used a gaussian\nmixture model whose parameters were learned from a cleaned subset of a real\ndemographic and health dataset to generate the synthetic data. We simulated\nvarious missingness degrees ranging from $10 \\%$, $20 \\%$, $30 \\%$, and $40\\%$\nunder the missing completely at random scheme MCAR. We used an integrated\nperformance analysis framework involving clustering, classification and direct\nimputation analysis. Our results show that models trained on synthetic and\nimputed datasets could make predictions with an accuracy of $83 \\%$ and $80 \\%$\non $a) $ an unseen real dataset and $b)$ an unseen reserved synthetic test\ndataset, respectively. Moreover, the models that used the DAE method for\nimputed yielded the lowest log loss an indication of good performance, even\nthough the accuracy measures were slightly lower.

    "abstract": "Feature selection is of great importance in Machine Learning, where it can be\nused to reduce the dimensionality of classification, ranking and prediction\nproblems. The removal of redundant and noisy features can improve both the\naccuracy and scalability of the trained models. However, feature selection is a\ncomputationally expensive task with a solution space that grows\ncombinatorically. In this work, we consider in particular a quadratic feature\nselection problem that can be tackled with the Quantum Approximate Optimization\nAlgorithm (QAOA), already employed in combinatorial optimization. First we\nrepresent the feature selection problem with the QUBO formulation, which is\nthen mapped to an Ising spin Hamiltonian. Then we apply QAOA with the goal of\nfinding the ground state of this Hamiltonian, which corresponds to the optimal\nselection of features. In our experiments, we consider seven different\nreal-world datasets with dimensionality up to 21 and run QAOA on both a quantum\nsimulator and, for small datasets, the 7-qubit IBM (ibm-perth) quantum\ncomputer. We use the set of selected features to train a classification model\nand evaluate its accuracy. Our analysis shows that it is possible to tackle the\nfeature selection problem with QAOA and that currently available quantum\ndevices can be used effectively.

    "abstract": "Providing accurate estimated time of package delivery on users' purchasing\npages for e-commerce platforms is of great importance to their purchasing\ndecisions and post-purchase experiences. Although this problem shares some\ncommon issues with the conventional estimated time of arrival (ETA), it is more\nchallenging with the following aspects: 1) Inductive inference. Models are\nrequired to predict ETA for orders with unseen retailers and addresses; 2)\nHigh-order interaction of order semantic information. Apart from the\nspatio-temporal features, the estimated time also varies greatly with other\nfactors, such as the packaging efficiency of retailers, as well as the\nhigh-order interaction of these factors. In this paper, we propose an inductive\ngraph transformer (IGT) that leverages raw feature information and structural\ngraph data to estimate package delivery time. Different from previous graph\ntransformer architectures, IGT adopts a decoupled pipeline and trains\ntransformer as a regression function that can capture the multiplex information\nfrom both raw feature and dense embeddings encoded by a graph neural network\n(GNN). In addition, we further simplify the GNN structure by removing its\nnon-linear activation and the learnable linear transformation matrix. The\nreduced parameter search space and linear information propagation in the\nsimplified GNN enable the IGT to be applied in large-scale industrial\nscenarios. Experiments on real-world logistics datasets show that our proposed\nmodel can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods on estimation\nof delivery time.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a distributed coverage control strategy for quadcopters\nequipped with downward-facing cameras that prevents the appearance of\nunmonitored areas in between the quadcopters' fields of view (FOVs). We derive\na necessary and sufficient condition for eliminating any unsurveilled area that\nmay arise in between the FOVs among a trio of quadcopters by utilizing a power\ndiagram, i.e. a weighted Voronoi diagram defined by radii of FOVs. Because this\ncondition can be described as logically combined constraints, we leverage\nnonsmooth control barrier functions (NCBFs) to prevent the appearance of\nunmonitored areas among a team's FOV. We then investigate the symmetric\nproperties of the proposed NCBFs to develop a distributed algorithm. The\nproposed algorithm can support the switching of the NCBFs caused by changes of\nthe quadcopters composing trios. The existence of the control input satisfying\nNCBF conditions is analyzed by employing the characteristics of the power\ndiagram. The proposed framework is synthesized with a coverage control law that\nmaximizes the monitoring quality while reducing overlaps of FOVs. The proposed\nmethod is demonstrated in simulation and experiment.",

    "abstract": "Data augmentation is a valuable tool for the design of deep learning systems\nto overcome data limitations and stabilize the training process. Especially in\nthe medical domain, where the collection of large-scale data sets is\nchallenging and expensive due to limited access to patient data, relevant\nenvironments, as well as strict regulations, community-curated large-scale\npublic datasets, pretrained models, and advanced data augmentation methods are\nthe main factors for developing reliable systems to improve patient care.\nHowever, for the development of medical acoustic sensing systems, an emerging\nfield of research, the community lacks large-scale publicly available data sets\nand pretrained models. To address the problem of limited data, we propose a\nconditional generative adversarial neural network-based augmentation method\nwhich is able to synthesize mel spectrograms from a learned data distribution\nof a source data set. In contrast to previously proposed fully convolutional\nmodels, the proposed model implements residual Squeeze and Excitation modules\nin the generator architecture. We show that our method outperforms all\nclassical audio augmentation techniques and previously published generative\nmethods in terms of generated sample quality and a performance improvement of\n2.84% of Macro F1-Score for a classifier trained on the augmented data set, an\nenhancement of $1.14\\%$ in relation to previous work. By analyzing the\ncorrelation of intermediate feature spaces, we show that the residual Squeeze\nand Excitation modules help the model to reduce redundancy in the latent\nfeatures. Therefore, the proposed model advances the state-of-the-art in the\naugmentation of clinical audio data and improves the data bottleneck for the\ndesign of clinical acoustic sensing systems.",

This so-called\noff-manifold conjecture has inspired a novel line of defenses against\nadversarial attacks on images. In this study, we find a similar phenomenon\noccurs in the contextualized embedding space induced by pretrained language\nmodels, in which adversarial texts tend to have their embeddings diverge from\nthe manifold of natural ones. Based on this finding, we propose Textual\nManifold-based Defense (TMD), a defense mechanism that projects text embeddings\nonto an approximated embedding manifold before classification. It reduces the\ncomplexity of potential adversarial examples, which ultimately enhances the\nrobustness of the protected model. Through extensive experiments, our method\nconsistently and significantly outperforms previous defenses under various\nattack settings without trading off clean accuracy.

This attack can be perpetrated even if the\ntarget model is a black box, supposed that the machine-learning model is\nprovided as a service and the attacker can query the model and collect its\noutputs. So far, no defense has been demonstrated effective in this scenario.\nWe show for the first time that this attack is detectable using stateful\ndefenses, which store the queries made to the classifier and detect the\nabnormal cases in which they are similar.

Many important decidability results about\nVAS were obtained by considering geometric properties of their reachability\nsets, i.e. the set of configurations reachable from some initial configuration\n$c_0$. For example, in 2012 Jerome Leroux proved that if a configuration $c_t$\nis not reachable, then there exists a semilinear inductive invariant separating\nthe reachability set from $c_t$. This gave an alternative proof of decidability\nof the reachability problem. The paper introduced the class of petri-sets,\nproved that reachability sets are petri-sets, and that petri-sets have this\nproperty. In a follow-up paper in 2013, Jerome Leroux again used the class of\npetri-sets to prove that if a reachability set is semilinear, then a\nrepresentation of it can be computed. In this paper, we utilize the class of\npetri-sets to answer the opposite type of question: Even if the reachability\nset is non-semilinear, what form can it have? We give another proof that\nsemilinearity of the reachability set is decidable, which was first shown by\nHauschildt in 1990.

However, in Open-World CZSL (OW-CZSL), their performance\ntends to degrade significantly due to the large cardinality of possible\ncompositions. Some recent works separately predict simple primitives (i.e.,\nstates and objects) to reduce cardinality. However, they consider simple\nprimitives as independent probability distributions, ignoring the heavy\ndependence between states, objects, and compositions. In this paper, we model\nthe dependence of compositions via feasibility and contextuality.\nFeasibility-dependence refers to the unequal feasibility relations between\nsimple primitives, e.g., \\textit{hairy} is more feasible with \\textit{cat} than\nwith \\textit{building} in the real world. Contextuality-dependence represents\nthe contextual variance in images, e.g., \\textit{cat} shows diverse appearances\nunder the state of \\textit{dry} and \\textit{wet}. We design Semantic Attention\n(SA) and generative Knowledge Disentanglement (KD) to learn the dependence of\nfeasibility and contextuality, respectively. SA captures semantics in\ncompositions to alleviate impossible predictions, driven by the visual\nsimilarity between simple primitives.

    "abstract": "End-to-end singing voice synthesis (SVS) model VISinger can achieve better\nperformance than the typical two-stage model with fewer parameters. However,\nVISinger has several problems: text-to-phase problem, the end-to-end model\nlearns the meaningless mapping of text-to-phase; glitches problem, the harmonic\ncomponents corresponding to the periodic signal of the voiced segment occurs a\nsudden change with audible artefacts; low sampling rate, the sampling rate of\n24KHz does not meet the application needs of high-fidelity generation with the\nfull-band rate (44.1KHz or higher). In this paper, we propose VISinger 2 to\naddress these issues by integrating the digital signal processing (DSP) methods\nwith VISinger. Specifically, inspired by recent advances in differentiable\ndigital signal processing (DDSP), we incorporate a DSP synthesizer into the\ndecoder to solve the above issues. The DSP synthesizer consists of a harmonic\nsynthesizer and a noise synthesizer to generate periodic and aperiodic signals,\nrespectively, from the latent representation z in VISinger. It supervises the\nposterior encoder to extract the latent representation without phase\ninformation and avoid the prior encoder modelling text-to-phase mapping. To\navoid glitch artefacts, the HiFi-GAN is modified to accept the waveforms\ngenerated by the DSP synthesizer as a condition to produce the singing voice.\nMoreover, with the improved waveform decoder, VISinger 2 manages to generate\n44.1kHz singing audio with richer expression and better quality.

Different from most existing classical graph kernels, the proposed\nHAQJSK kernels can incorporate hierarchical aligned structure information\nbetween graphs and transform graphs of random sizes into fixed-sized aligned\ngraph structures, i.e., the Hierarchical Transitive Aligned Adjacency Matrix of\nvertices and the Hierarchical Transitive Aligned Density Matrix of the\nContinuous-Time Quantum Walk (CTQW). For a pair of graphs to hand, the\nresulting HAQJSK kernels are defined by measuring the Quantum Jensen-Shannon\nDivergence (QJSD) between their transitive aligned graph structures. We show\nthat the proposed HAQJSK kernels not only reflect richer intrinsic global graph\ncharacteristics in terms of the CTQW, but also address the drawback of\nneglecting structural correspondence information arising in most existing\nR-convolution kernels. Furthermore, unlike the previous Quantum Jensen-Shannon\nKernels associated with the QJSD and the CTQW, the proposed HAQJSK kernels can\nsimultaneously guarantee the properties of permutation invariant and positive\ndefiniteness, explaining the theoretical advantages of the HAQJSK kernels.\nExperiments indicate the effectiveness of the proposed kernels.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we increase the availability and integration of devices in the\nlearning process to enhance the convergence of federated learning (FL) models.\nTo address the issue of having all the data in one location, federated\nlearning, which maintains the ability to learn over decentralized data sets,\ncombines privacy and technology. Until the model converges, the server combines\nthe updated weights obtained from each dataset over a number of rounds. The\nmajority of the literature suggested client selection techniques to accelerate\nconvergence and boost accuracy. However, none of the existing proposals have\nfocused on the flexibility to deploy and select clients as needed, wherever and\nwhenever that may be. Due to the extremely dynamic surroundings, some devices\nare actually not available to serve as clients in FL, which affects the\navailability of data for learning and the applicability of the existing\nsolution for client selection. In this paper, we address the aforementioned\nlimitations by introducing an On-Demand-FL, a client deployment approach for\nFL, offering more volume and heterogeneity of data in the learning process. We\nmake use of the containerization technology such as Docker to build efficient\nenvironments using IoT and mobile devices serving as volunteers. Furthermore,\nKubernetes is used for orchestration. The Genetic algorithm (GA) is used to\nsolve the multi-objective optimization problem due to its evolutionary\nstrategy. The performed experiments using the Mobile Data Challenge (MDC)\ndataset and the Localfed framework illustrate the relevance of the proposed\napproach and the efficiency of the on-the-fly deployment of clients whenever\nand wherever needed with less discarded rounds and more available data.",

    "abstract": "We propose a simple yet effective reflection-free cue for robust reflection\nremoval from a pair of flash and ambient (no-flash) images. The reflection-free\ncue exploits a flash-only image obtained by subtracting the ambient image from\nthe corresponding flash image in raw data space. The flash-only image is\nequivalent to an image taken in a dark environment with only a flash on. This\nflash-only image is visually reflection-free and thus can provide robust cues\nto infer the reflection in the ambient image. Since the flash-only image\nusually has artifacts, we further propose a dedicated model that not only\nutilizes the reflection-free cue but also avoids introducing artifacts, which\nhelps accurately estimate reflection and transmission. Our experiments on\nreal-world images with various types of reflection demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our model with reflection-free flash-only cues: our model\noutperforms state-of-the-art reflection removal approaches by more than 5.23dB\nin PSNR. We extend our approach to handheld photography to address the\nmisalignment between the flash and no-flash pair. With misaligned training data\nand the alignment module, our aligned model outperforms our previous version by\nmore than 3.19dB in PSNR on a misaligned dataset.

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is one of the common cancers that endanger the health of women\nglobally. Accurate target lesion segmentation is essential for early clinical\nintervention and postoperative follow-up. Recently, many convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) have been proposed to segment breast tumors from ultrasound\nimages. However, the complex ultrasound pattern and the variable tumor shape\nand size bring challenges to the accurate segmentation of the breast lesion.\nMotivated by the selective kernel convolution, we introduce an enhanced\nselective kernel convolution for breast tumor segmentation, which integrates\nmultiple feature map region representations and adaptively recalibrates the\nweights of these feature map regions from the channel and spatial dimensions.\nThis region recalibration strategy enables the network to focus more on\nhigh-contributing region features and mitigate the perturbation of less useful\nregions. Finally, the enhanced selective kernel convolution is integrated into\nU-net with deep supervision constraints to adaptively capture the robust\nrepresentation of breast tumors. Extensive experiments with twelve\nstate-of-the-art deep learning segmentation methods on three public breast\nultrasound datasets demonstrate that our method has a more competitive\nsegmentation performance in breast ultrasound images.",

    "abstract": "Epistemic graphs generalize the epistemic approach to probabilistic\nargumentation and tackle the uncertainties in and between arguments. A\nframework was proposed to generate epistemic constraints from data using a\ntwo-way generalization method in the perspective of only considering the\nbeliefs of participants without considering the nature of relations represented\nin an epistemic graph. The deficiency of original framework is that it is\nunable to learn rules using tighter constraints, and the learnt rules might be\ncounterintuitive. Meanwhile, when dealing with more restricted values, the\nfiltering computational complexity will increase sharply, and the time\nperformance would become unreasonable. This paper introduces a filtering-based\napproach using a multiple-way generalization step to generate a set of rational\nrules based on both the beliefs of each agent on different arguments and the\nepistemic graph corresponding to the epistemic constraints. This approach is\nable to generated rational rules with multiple restricted values in higher\nefficiency. Meanwhile, we have proposed a standard to analyze the rationality\nof a dataset based on the postulates of deciding rational rules. We evaluate\nthe filtering-based approach on two suitable data bases. The empirical results\nshow that the filtering-based approach performs well with a better efficiency\ncomparing to the original framework, and rules generated from the improved\napproach are ensured to be rational.",

In this paper, we\nattempted to address two major challenges. First, in order to deal with the\nsparsely-labeled physiological data, we first decomposed the raw physiological\ndata using signal spectrum analysis, based on which we extracted both\ncomplexity and energy features. Such a procedure helped reduce noise and\nimprove feature extraction effectiveness. Second, in order to improve the\nexplainability of the machine learning models in emotion recognition with\nphysiological data, we proposed Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) and\nSHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for emotion prediction and model\nexplanation, respectively. The LightGBM model outperformed the eXtreme Gradient\nBoosting (XGBoost) model on the public Database for Emotion Analysis using\nPhysiological signals (DEAP) with f1-scores of 0.814, 0.823, and 0.860 for\nbinary classification of valence, arousal, and liking, respectively, with\ncross-subject validation using eight peripheral physiological signals.\nFurthermore, the SHAP model was able to identify the most important features in\nemotion recognition, and revealed the relationships between the predictor\nvariables and the response variables in terms of their main effects and\ninteraction effects.

Two methods use a well-known Machine Learning (ML) algorithm as\na complement, and the other three use only confidence values that the DNN\nestimates. We compare seven different metrics, such as the Expected Calibration\nError (ECE), Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), Mean Confidence (MC), Mean\nAccuracy (MA), Normalized Negative Log Likelihood (NLL), Brier Score Loss\n(BSL), and Reliability Score (RS) and the tradeoffs between them to evaluate\nthe proposed hybrid algorithms.

But the large scale of antennas in massive\nMIMO systems causes huge feedback overhead. Deep learning (DL) based methods\ncan compress the CSI at the UE and recover it at the BS, which reduces the\nfeedback cost significantly. But the compressed CSI must be quantized into bit\nstreams for transmission. In this paper, we propose an adaptor-assisted\nquantization strategy for bit-level DL-based CSI feedback. First, we design a\nnetwork-aided adaptor and an advanced training scheme to adaptively improve the\nquantization and reconstruction accuracy.

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB), an infectious bacterial disease, is a significant cause of\ndeath, especially in low-income countries, with an estimated ten million new\ncases reported globally in $2020$. While TB is treatable, non-adherence to the\nmedication regimen is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Thus,\nproactively identifying patients at risk of dropping off their medication\nregimen enables corrective measures to mitigate adverse outcomes. Using a proxy\nmeasure of extreme non-adherence and a dataset of nearly $700,000$ patients\nfrom four states in India, we formulate and solve the machine learning (ML)\nproblem of early prediction of non-adherence based on a custom rank-based\nmetric. We train ML models and evaluate against baselines, achieving a $\\sim\n100\\%$ lift over rule-based baselines and $\\sim 214\\%$ over a random\nclassifier, taking into account country-wide large-scale future deployment. We\ndeal with various issues in the process, including data quality,\nhigh-cardinality categorical data, low target prevalence, distribution shift,\nvariation across cohorts, algorithmic fairness, and the need for robustness and\nexplainability. Our findings indicate that risk stratification of non-adherent\npatients is a viable, deployable-at-scale ML solution.",

    "abstract": "We present the design, development, and evaluation of HREyes: biomimetic\ncommunication devices which use light to communicate information and, for the\nfirst time, gaze direction from AUVs to humans. First, we introduce two types\nof information displays using the HREye devices: active lucemes and ocular\nlucemes. Active lucemes communicate information explicitly through animations,\nwhile ocular lucemes communicate gaze direction implicitly by mimicking human\neyes. We present a human study in which our system is compared to the use of an\nembedded digital display that explicitly communicates information to a diver by\ndisplaying text. Our results demonstrate accurate recognition of active lucemes\nfor trained interactants, limited intuitive understanding of these lucemes for\nuntrained interactants, and relatively accurate perception of gaze direction\nfor all interactants. The results on active luceme recognition demonstrate more\naccurate recognition than previous light-based communication systems for AUVs\n(albeit with different phrase sets). Additionally, the ocular lucemes we\nintroduce in this work represent the first method for communicating gaze\ndirection from an AUV, a critical aspect of nonverbal communication used in\ncollaborative work. With readily available hardware as well as open-source and\neasily re-configurable programming, HREyes can be easily integrated into any\nAUV with the physical space for the devices and used to communicate effectively\nwith divers in any underwater environment with appropriate visibility.",

While training the model\nwith new batches of data the model looses it's ability to classify the previous\ndata judiciously which is termed as catastrophic forgetting. Conventional\nmethods have tried to mitigate catastrophic forgetting of the previously\nlearned data while the training at the current session has been compromised.\nThe state-of-the-art generative replay based approaches use complicated\nstructures such as generative adversarial network (GAN) to deal with\ncatastrophic forgetting. Additionally, training a GAN with few samples may lead\nto instability. In this work, we present a novel method to deal with these two\nmajor hurdles.

Moreover, our approach is\nable to retain previously acquired knowledge in the embedding space even when\ntrained with new classes. We update previous session class prototypes while\ntraining in such a way that it is able to represent the true class mean. This\nis of prime importance as our classification rule is based on the nearest class\nmean classification strategy.

In the theory community, the most popular approach for map\nmatching is to compute a path on the road network that is the most spatially\nsimilar to the trajectory, where spatial similarity is measured using the\nFr\\'echet distance. A shortcoming of existing map matching algorithms under the\nFr\\'echet distance is that every time a trajectory is matched, the entire road\nnetwork needs to be reprocessed from scratch. An open problem is whether one\ncan preprocess the road network into a data structure, so that map matching\nqueries can be answered in sublinear time.\nIn this paper, we investigate map matching queries under the Fr\\'echet\ndistance. We provide a negative result for geometric planar graphs. We show\nthat, unless SETH fails, there is no data structure that can be constructed in\npolynomial time that answers map matching queries in $O((pq)^{1-\\delta})$ query\ntime for any $\\delta > 0$, where $p$ and $q$ are the complexities of the\ngeometric planar graph and the query trajectory, respectively.

    "abstract": "Time Series Forecasting has been an active area of research due to its many\napplications ranging from network usage prediction, resource allocation,\nanomaly detection, and predictive maintenance. Numerous publications published\nin the last five years have proposed diverse sets of objective loss functions\nto address cases such as biased data, long-term forecasting, multicollinear\nfeatures, etc. In this paper, we have summarized 14 well-known regression loss\nfunctions commonly used for time series forecasting and listed out the\ncircumstances where their application can aid in faster and better model\nconvergence. We have also demonstrated how certain categories of loss functions\nperform well across all data sets and can be considered as a baseline objective\nfunction in circumstances where the distribution of the data is unknown.

The controllable synthesis ability of GAN generators\nsuggests that they maintain informative, disentangled, and explainable image\nrepresentations, but leveraging and transferring their representations to\ndownstream tasks is largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose to distill\nknowledge from GAN generators by squeezing and spanning their representations.\nWe squeeze the generator features into representations that are invariant to\nsemantic-preserving transformations through a network before they are distilled\ninto the student network. We span the distilled representation of the synthetic\ndomain to the real domain by also using real training data to remedy the mode\ncollapse of GANs and boost the student network performance in a real domain.\nExperiments justify the efficacy of our method and reveal its great\nsignificance in self-supervised representation learning.

    "abstract": "The success of state-of-the-art deep neural networks heavily relies on the\npresence of large-scale labelled datasets, which are extremely expensive and\ntime-consuming to annotate. This paper focuses on tackling semi-supervised part\nsegmentation tasks by generating high-quality images with a pre-trained GAN and\nlabelling the generated images with an automatic annotator. In particular, we\nformulate the annotator learning as a learning-to-learn problem. Given a\npre-trained GAN, the annotator learns to label object parts in a set of\nrandomly generated images such that a part segmentation model trained on these\nsynthetic images with their predicted labels obtains low segmentation error on\na small validation set of manually labelled images. We further reduce this\nnested-loop optimization problem to a simple gradient matching problem and\nefficiently solve it with an iterative algorithm. We show that our method can\nlearn annotators from a broad range of labelled images including real images,\ngenerated images, and even analytically rendered images.

Egocentric vision\nseems to be a viable solution to solve this problem, and therefore many works\nprovide deep learning solutions to infer human actions from first person\nvideos. However, although very promising, most of these do not consider the\nmajor challenges that comes with a realistic deployment, such as the\nportability of the model, the need for real-time inference, and the robustness\nwith respect to the novel domains (i.e., new spaces, users, tasks). With this\npaper, we set the boundaries that egocentric vision models should consider for\nrealistic applications, defining a novel setting of egocentric action\nrecognition in the wild, which encourages researchers to develop novel,\napplications-aware solutions. We also present a new model-agnostic technique\nthat enables the rapid repurposing of existing architectures in this new\ncontext, demonstrating the feasibility to deploy a model on a tiny device\n(Jetson Nano) and to perform the task directly on the edge with very low energy\nconsumption (2.4W on average at 50 fps).",

    "abstract": "Proper functioning of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) is crucial for\nthe safety and efficiency of future intelligent transport systems. Meanwhile,\ntransitioning to fully autonomous driving requires a long period of mixed\nautonomy traffic, including both CAVs and human-driven vehicles. Thus,\ncollaboration decision-making for CAVs is essential to generate appropriate\ndriving behaviors to enhance the safety and efficiency of mixed autonomy\ntraffic. In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been widely\nused in solving decision-making problems. However, the existing DRL-based\nmethods have been mainly focused on solving the decision-making of a single\nCAV. Using the existing DRL-based methods in mixed autonomy traffic cannot\naccurately represent the mutual effects of vehicles and model dynamic traffic\nenvironments. To address these shortcomings, this article proposes a graph\nreinforcement learning (GRL) approach for multi-agent decision-making of CAVs\nin mixed autonomy traffic. First, a generic and modular GRL framework is\ndesigned. Then, a systematic review of DRL and GRL methods is presented,\nfocusing on the problems addressed in recent research. Moreover, a comparative\nstudy on different GRL methods is further proposed based on the designed\nframework to verify the effectiveness of GRL methods. Results show that the GRL\nmethods can well optimize the performance of multi-agent decision-making for\nCAVs in mixed autonomy traffic compared to the DRL methods. Finally, challenges\nand future research directions are summarized. This study can provide a\nvaluable research reference for solving the multi-agent decision-making\nproblems of CAVs in mixed autonomy traffic and can promote the implementation\nof GRL-based methods into intelligent transportation systems.

However, incorrect matches may still exist, while careful\nexamination of such problems is often skipped. Accordingly, a geometrically\nconstrained algorithm is proposed in this work to verify the correctness of\ninitially matched SIFT keypoints based on view-invariant cross-ratios (CRs). By\nrandomly forming pentagons from these keypoints and matching their shape and\nlocation among images with CRs, robust planar region estimation can be achieved\nefficiently for the above verification, while correct and incorrect matches of\nkeypoints can be examined easily with respect to those shape and location\nmatched pentagons.

This inference enables context-aware and\npersonalized user experiences in general mobile apps and valuable feedback and\ninterventions in mobile health apps. However, even though model generalization\nissues have been highlighted in many studies, the focus has always been on\nimproving the accuracies of models using different sensing modalities and\nmachine learning techniques, with datasets collected in homogeneous\npopulations. In contrast, less attention has been given to studying the\nperformance of mood inference models to assess whether models generalize to new\ncountries. In this study, we collected a mobile sensing dataset with 329K\nself-reports from 678 participants in eight countries (China, Denmark, India,\nItaly, Mexico, Mongolia, Paraguay, UK) to assess the effect of geographical\ndiversity on mood inference models. We define and evaluate country-specific\n(trained and tested within a country), continent-specific (trained and tested\nwithin a continent), country-agnostic (tested on a country not seen on training\ndata), and multi-country (trained and tested with multiple countries)\napproaches trained on sensor data for two mood inference tasks with\npopulation-level (non-personalized) and hybrid (partially personalized) models.\nWe show that partially personalized country-specific models perform the best\nyielding area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) scores\nof the range 0.78-0.98 for two-class (negative vs. positive valence) and\n0.76-0.94 for three-class (negative vs. neutral vs. positive valence)\ninference.

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have received great attention due to their\nsuccess in various graph-related learning tasks. Several GNN frameworks have\nthen been developed for fast and easy implementation of GNN models. Despite\ntheir popularity, they are not well documented, and their implementations and\nsystem performance have not been well understood. In particular, unlike the\ntraditional GNNs that are trained based on the entire graph in a full-batch\nmanner, recent GNNs have been developed with different graph sampling\ntechniques for mini-batch training of GNNs on large graphs. While they improve\nthe scalability, their training times still depend on the implementations in\nthe frameworks as sampling and its associated operations can introduce\nnon-negligible overhead and computational cost. In addition, it is unknown how\nmuch the frameworks are 'eco-friendly' from a green computing perspective. In\nthis paper, we provide an in-depth study of two mainstream GNN frameworks along\nwith three state-of-the-art GNNs to analyze their performance in terms of\nruntime and power/energy consumption. We conduct extensive benchmark\nexperiments at several different levels and present detailed analysis results\nand observations, which could be helpful for further improvement and\noptimization.",

    "abstract": "Modeling of turbulent combustion system requires modeling the underlying\nchemistry and the turbulent flow. Solving both systems simultaneously is\ncomputationally prohibitive. Instead, given the difference in scales at which\nthe two sub-systems evolve, the two sub-systems are typically (re)solved\nseparately. Popular approaches such as the Flamelet Generated Manifolds (FGM)\nuse a two-step strategy where the governing reaction kinetics are pre-computed\nand mapped to a low-dimensional manifold, characterized by a few reaction\nprogress variables (model reduction) and the manifold is then ``looked-up''\nduring the runtime to estimate the high-dimensional system state by the flow\nsystem. While existing works have focused on these two steps independently, in\nthis work we show that joint learning of the progress variables and the\nlook--up model, can yield more accurate results. We build on the base\nformulation and implementation ChemTab to include the dynamically generated\nThemochemical State Variables (Lower Dimensional Dynamic Source Terms).

Maintenance methods include corrective\nmaintenance and imperfect maintenance. Imperfect maintenance reduces the\ndegradation degree of the system according to a random proportion.

The impulse optimal control theory of PDMP is used to\ndetermine the optimal maintenance strategy. A numerical study dealing with\ncomponent coating maintenance problem is presented.

To further tackle the dramatic computation and\nmemory cost caused by the giant model size (i.e., number of weights) caused by\nmultiple cascaded layers, we propose sparse training to mitigate the training\ncost, while preserving the prediction accuracy.

The first fusion module focuses on extracting the shared\ninformation between modalities based on cross-modal attention. The second aims\nat integrating the RGB-specific and depth-specific information to enhance the\nfused features. By fusing both the modality-shared and modality-specific\ninformation in a modality-aware scheme, our DMTracker can learn discriminative\nrepresentations in complex tracking scenes. Experiments show that our proposed\ntracker achieves very promising results on challenging RGBD benchmarks. Code is\navailable at \\url{https://github.com/ShangGaoG/DMTracker}.",

However, the enabling technologies of the Metaverse, i.e.,\ndigital twin, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and extended reality, are\nknown to be energy-hungry, therefore raising concerns about the sustainability\nof its large-scale deployment and development. This article proposes Green\nMetaverse Networking for the first time to optimize energy efficiencies of all\nnetwork components for Metaverse sustainable development.

Next, focusing on computation and networking, we\npresent major advancements related to energy efficiency and their integration\ninto the Metaverse. A case study of energy conservation by incorporating\nsemantic communication and stochastic resource allocation in the Metaverse is\npresented.

    "abstract": "Existing deep learning based HDRTV reconstruction methods assume one kind of\ntone mapping operators (TMOs) as the degradation procedure to synthesize\nSDRTV-HDRTV pairs for supervised training. In this paper, we argue that,\nalthough traditional TMOs exploit efficient dynamic range compression priors,\nthey have several drawbacks on modeling the realistic degradation: information\nover-preservation, color bias and possible artifacts, making the trained\nreconstruction networks hard to generalize well to real-world cases. To solve\nthis problem, we propose a learning-based data synthesis approach to learn the\nproperties of real-world SDRTVs by integrating several tone mapping priors into\nboth network structures and loss functions. In specific, we design a\nconditioned two-stream network with prior tone mapping results as a guidance to\nsynthesize SDRTVs by both global and local transformations. To train the data\nsynthesis network, we form a novel self-supervised content loss to constraint\ndifferent aspects of the synthesized SDRTVs at regions with different\nbrightness distributions and an adversarial loss to emphasize the details to be\nmore realistic. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we synthesize\nSDRTV-HDRTV pairs with our method and use them to train several HDRTV\nreconstruction networks. Then we collect two inference datasets containing both\nlabeled and unlabeled real-world SDRTVs, respectively. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that, the networks trained with our synthesized data generalize\nsignificantly better to these two real-world datasets than existing solutions.",

    "abstract": "Target-specific stance detection on social media, which aims at classifying a\ntextual data instance such as a post or a comment into a stance class of a\ntarget issue, has become an emerging opinion mining paradigm of importance. An\nexample application would be to overcome vaccine hesitancy in combating the\ncoronavirus pandemic. However, existing stance detection strategies rely merely\non the individual instances which cannot always capture the expressed stance of\na given target. In response, we address a new task called conversational stance\ndetection which is to infer the stance towards a given target (e.g., COVID-19\nvaccination) when given a data instance and its corresponding conversation\nthread. To tackle the task, we first propose a benchmarking conversational\nstance detection (CSD) dataset with annotations of stances and the structures\nof conversation threads among the instances based on six major social media\nplatforms in Hong Kong. To infer the desired stances from both data instances\nand conversation threads, we propose a model called Branch-BERT that\nincorporates contextual information in conversation threads. Extensive\nexperiments on our CSD dataset show that our proposed model outperforms all the\nbaseline models that do not make use of contextual information. Specifically,\nit improves the F1 score by 10.3% compared with the state-of-the-art method in\nthe SemEval-2016 Task 6 competition. This shows the potential of incorporating\nrich contextual information on detecting target-specific stances on social\nmedia platforms and implies a more practical way to construct future stance\ndetection tasks.",

It aims at selecting a small number of users such that\nmaximizing the influence spread across the online social network. Because of\nits potential commercial and academic value, there are a lot of researchers\nfocusing on studying the IM problem from different perspectives. The main\nchallenge comes from the NP-hardness of the IM problem and \\#P-hardness of\nestimating the influence spread, thus traditional algorithms for overcoming\nthem can be categorized into two classes: heuristic algorithms and\napproximation algorithms. However, there is no theoretical guarantee for\nheuristic algorithms, and the theoretical design is close to the limit.\nTherefore, it is almost impossible to further optimize and improve their\nperformance.

    "abstract": "Positioning with one inertial measurement unit and one ranging sensor is\ncommonly thought to be feasible only when trajectories are in certain patterns\nensuring observability. For this reason, to pursue observable patterns, it is\nrequired either exciting the trajectory or searching key nodes in a long\ninterval, which is commonly highly nonlinear and may also lack resilience.\nTherefore, such a positioning approach is still not widely accepted in\nreal-world applications. To address this issue, this work first investigates\nthe dissipative nature of flying robots considering aerial drag effects and\nre-formulates the corresponding positioning problem, which guarantees\nobservability almost surely. On this basis, a dimension-reduced wriggling\nestimator is proposed accordingly. This estimator slides the estimation horizon\nin a stepping manner, and output matrices can be approximately evaluated based\non the historical estimation sequence. The computational complexity is then\nfurther reduced via a dimension-reduction approach using polynomial fittings.\nIn this way, the states of robots can be estimated via linear programming in a\nsufficiently long interval, and the degree of observability is thereby further\nenhanced because an adequate redundancy of measurements is available for each\nestimation. Subsequently, the estimator's convergence and numerical stability\nare proven theoretically. Finally, both indoor and outdoor experiments verify\nthat the proposed estimator can achieve decimeter-level precision at hundreds\nof hertz per second, and it is resilient to sensors' failures. Hopefully, this\nstudy can provide a new practical approach for self-localization as well as\nrelative positioning of cooperative agents with low-cost and lightweight\nsensors.",

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Network (DNN) based video analytics empowers many computer\nvision-based applications to achieve high recognition accuracy. To reduce\ninference delay and bandwidth cost for video analytics, the DNN models can be\ndeployed on the edge nodes, which are proximal to end users. However, the\nprocessing capacity of an edge node is limited, potentially incurring\nsubstantial delay if the inference requests on an edge node is overloaded.\nWhile efforts have been made to enhance video analytics by optimizing the\nconfigurations on a single edge node, we observe that multiple edge nodes can\nwork collaboratively by utilizing the idle resources on each other to improve\nthe overall processing capacity and resource utilization. To this end, we\npropose a Multiagent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) based approach, named as\nEdgeVision, for collaborative video analytics on distributed edges. The edge\nnodes can jointly learn the optimal policies for video preprocessing, model\nselection, and request dispatching by collaborating with each other to minimize\nthe overall cost. We design an actor-critic-based MARL algorithm with an\nattention mechanism to learn the optimal policies. We build a multi-edge-node\ntestbed and conduct experiments with real-world datasets to evaluate the\nperformance of our method. The experimental results show our method can improve\nthe overall rewards by 33.6%-86.4% compared with the most competitive baseline\nmethods.",

    "abstract": "With the continuous development of large-scale complex hybrid AC-DC grids,\nthe fast adjustability of HVDC systems is required by the grid to provide\nfrequency regulation services. This paper develops a fully data-driven linear\nquadratic regulator (LQR) for the HVDC to provide temporal frequency support.\nThe main technical challenge is the complexity and the nonlinearity of\nmulti-infeed hybrid AC-DC (MIDC) systems dynamics that make the LQR\nintractable. Based on Koopman operator (KO) theory, a Koopman eigenpairs\nconstruction method is developed to fit a global linear dynamic model of MIDC\nsystems. Once globally linear representation of uncontrolled system dynamics is\nobtained offline, the control term is constituted by the gradient of the\nidentified eigenfunctions and the control matrix $\\mathbf{B}$. In case that\n$\\mathbf{B}$ is unknown, we propose a method to identify it based on the\nverified Koopman eigenfunctions. The active power reference is optimized online\nfor LCC-HVDC in a moving horizon fashion to provide frequency support, with\nonly local frequency and transmission power measurements. The robustness of the\nproposed control method against approximation errors of the linear\nrepresentation in eigenfunction coordinates is analyzed.

Such feedback loops have found their way to a variety of practical\napplications; typical examples are an elastic cloud to adapt computing\nresources and automated server management to respond quickly to business needs.\nTo gain insight into the motivations for applying self-adaptation in practice,\nthe problems solved using self-adaptation and how these problems are solved,\nand the difficulties and risks that industry faces in adopting self-adaptation,\nwe performed a large-scale survey. We received 184 valid responses from\npractitioners spread over 21 countries. Based on the analysis of the survey\ndata, we provide an empirically grounded overview of state-of-the-practice in\nthe application of self-adaptation. From that, we derive insights for\nresearchers to check their current research with industrial needs, and for\npractitioners to compare their current practice in applying self-adaptation.\nThese insights also provide opportunities for the application of\nself-adaptation in practice and pave the way for future industry-research\ncollaborations.",

As populations in these areas are already high and increasing, this is\nlikely to worsen in the coming years. Comparing the results with complaints,\nsurprisingly the rankings of footpaths in constituencies were contrary to the\nnumber of complaints in these constituencies, with high ranking constituencies\nreceiving the highest number of complaints, which would require further\nanalysis.

Existing RIS-assisted PKG\nmethods are mainly based on the idealistic assumption of an independent and\nidentically distributed (i.i.d.) channel model at both the base station (BS)\nand the RIS. However, the i.i.d. model is inaccurate for a typical RIS in an\nisotropic scattering environment and neglecting the existence of channel\nspatial correlation would possibly degrade the PKG performance. In this paper,\nwe establish a general spatially correlated channel model and propose a new\nchannel probing framework based on the transmit and the reflective beamforming.\nWe derive a closed-form key generation rate (KGR) expression and formulate an\noptimization problem, which is solved by using the low-complexity Block\nSuccessive Upper-bound Minimization (BSUM) with Mirror-Prox method.

    "abstract": "Data-driven identification of differential equations is an interesting but\nchallenging problem, especially when the given data are corrupted by noise.\nWhen the governing differential equation is a linear combination of various\ndifferential terms, the identification problem can be formulated as solving a\nlinear system, with the feature matrix consisting of linear and nonlinear terms\nmultiplied by a coefficient vector. This product is equal to the time\nderivative term, and thus generates dynamical behaviors. The goal is to\nidentify the correct terms that form the equation to capture the dynamics of\nthe given data. We propose a general and robust framework to recover\ndifferential equations using a weak formulation, for both ordinary and partial\ndifferential equations (ODEs and PDEs). The weak formulation facilitates an\nefficient and robust way to handle noise. For a robust recovery against noise\nand the choice of hyper-parameters, we introduce two new mechanisms, narrow-fit\nand trimming, for the coefficient support and value recovery, respectively. For\neach sparsity level, Subspace Pursuit is utilized to find an initial set of\nsupport from the large dictionary. Then, we focus on highly dynamic regions\n(rows of the feature matrix), and error normalize the feature matrix in the\nnarrow-fit step. The support is further updated via trimming of the terms that\ncontribute the least. Finally, the support set of features with the smallest\nCross-Validation error is chosen as the result. A comprehensive set of\nnumerical experiments are presented for both systems of ODEs and PDEs with\nvarious noise levels. The proposed method gives a robust recovery of the\ncoefficients, and a significant denoising effect which can handle up to $100\\%$\nnoise-to-signal ratio for some equations.

However, machine learning algorithms do not\nnecessarily perform well on a new domain with a different distribution than its\ntraining set. Domain Adaptation (DA) is used to mitigate this problem. One\napproach of existing DA algorithms is to find domain invariant features whose\ndistributions in the source domain are the same as their distribution in the\ntarget domain. In this paper, we propose to let the classifier that performs\nthe final classification task on the target domain learn implicitly the\ninvariant features to perform classification. It is achieved via feeding the\nclassifier during training generated fake samples that are similar to samples\nfrom both the source and target domains. We call these generated samples\ndomain-agnostic samples. To accomplish this we propose a novel variation of\ngenerative adversarial networks (GAN), called the MiddleGAN, that generates\nfake samples that are similar to samples from both the source and target\ndomains, using two discriminators and one generator. We extend the theory of\nGAN to show that there exist optimal solutions for the parameters of the two\ndiscriminators and one generator in MiddleGAN, and empirically show that the\nsamples generated by the MiddleGAN are similar to both samples from the source\ndomain and samples from the target domain.

We study the problem of adding one more vertex $v$ at the end of\n$S$ in order to minimize the load. This problem occurs in the context of\noptimally locating a new service facility ({\\it e.g.}, a school or a hospital)\nwhile taking into account already existing facilities, and with the goal of\nminimizing the maximum congestion at a site. There is a brute-force algorithm\nfor solving this problem in ${\\cal O}(nm)$ time on $n$-vertex $m$-edge graphs.\nWe prove a matching time lower bound for the special case where $m=n^{1+o(1)}$\nand $p=1$, assuming the so called Hitting Set Conjecture of Abboud et al. On\nthe positive side, we present simple linear-time algorithms for this problem on\ncliques, paths and cycles, and almost linear-time algorithms for trees, proper\ninterval graphs and (assuming $p$ to be a constant) bounded-treewidth graphs.",

Therefore, it is practically important\nto find an appropriate method to effectively adapt PLMs to a target domain of\ninterest.

We propose a prototype-based post-hoc policy explainer, ProtoX, that\nexplains a blackbox agent by prototyping the agent's behaviors into scenarios,\neach represented by a prototypical state. When learning prototypes, ProtoX\nconsiders both visual similarity and scenario similarity. The latter is unique\nto the reinforcement learning context, since it explains why the same action is\ntaken in visually different states. To teach ProtoX about visual similarity, we\npre-train an encoder using contrastive learning via self-supervised learning to\nrecognize states as similar if they occur close together in time and receive\nthe same action from the black-box agent. We then add an isometry layer to\nallow ProtoX to adapt scenario similarity to the downstream task. ProtoX is\ntrained via imitation learning using behavior cloning, and thus requires no\naccess to the environment or agent. In addition to explanation fidelity, we\ndesign different prototype shaping terms in the objective function to encourage\nbetter interpretability. We conduct various experiments to test ProtoX.

    "abstract": "A reliable pose estimator robust to environmental disturbances is desirable\nfor mobile robots. To this end, inertial measurement units (IMUs) play an\nimportant role because they can perceive the full motion state of the vehicle\nindependently. However, it suffers from accumulative error due to inherent\nnoise and bias instability, especially for low-cost sensors. In our previous\nstudies on Wheel-INS \\cite{niu2021, wu2021}, we proposed to limit the error\ndrift of the pure inertial navigation system (INS) by mounting an IMU to the\nwheel of the robot to take advantage of rotation modulation. However, it still\ndrifted over a long period of time due to the lack of external correction\nsignals. In this letter, we propose to exploit the environmental perception\nability of Wheel-INS to achieve simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)\nwith only one IMU. To be specific, we use the road bank angles (mirrored by the\nrobot roll angles estimated by Wheel-INS) as terrain features to enable the\nloop closure with a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter. The road bank angle is\nsampled and stored according to the robot position in the grid maps maintained\nby the particles. The weights of the particles are updated according to the\ndifference between the currently estimated roll sequence and the terrain map.\nField experiments suggest the feasibility of the idea to perform SLAM in\nWheel-INS using the robot roll angle estimates. In addition, the positioning\naccuracy is improved significantly (more than 30\\%) over Wheel-INS.

There\nare two main variants of contrastive learning, namely instance and class\ndiscrimination, targeting features that can discriminate between different\ninstances for the former, and different classes for the latter.\nIn this paper, we aim to understand the effectiveness and limitation of\nexisting contrastive learning methods for OOD detection. We approach this in 3\nways. First, we systematically study the performance difference between the\ninstance discrimination and supervised contrastive learning variants in\ndifferent OOD detection settings. Second, we study which in-distribution (ID)\nclasses OOD data tend to be classified into. Finally, we study the spectral\ndecay property of the different contrastive learning approaches and examine how\nit correlates with OOD detection performance. In scenarios where the ID and OOD\ndatasets are sufficiently different from one another, we see that instance\ndiscrimination, in the absence of fine-tuning, is competitive with supervised\napproaches in OOD detection. We see that OOD samples tend to be classified into\nclasses that have a distribution similar to the distribution of the entire\ndataset. Furthermore, we show that contrastive learning learns a feature space\nthat contains singular vectors containing several directions with a high\nvariance which can be detrimental or beneficial to OOD detection depending on\nthe inference approach used.",

    "abstract": "Large pre-trained, zero-shot capable models have shown considerable success\nboth for standard transfer and adaptation tasks, with particular robustness\ntowards distribution shifts. In addition, subsequent fine-tuning can\nconsiderably improve performance on a selected downstream task. However,\nthrough naive fine-tuning, these zero-shot models lose their generalizability\nand robustness towards distribution shifts. This is a particular problem for\ntasks such as Continual Learning (CL), where continuous adaptation has to be\nperformed as new task distributions are introduced sequentially. In this work,\nwe showcase that where fine-tuning falls short to adapt such zero-shot capable\nmodels, simple momentum-based weight interpolation can provide consistent\nimprovements for CL tasks in both memory-free and memory-based settings. In\nparticular, we find improvements of over $+4\\%$ on standard CL benchmarks,\nwhile reducing the error to the upper limit of jointly training on all tasks at\nonce in parts by more than half, allowing the continual learner to inch closer\nto the joint training limits.",

    "title": "Integration-free Learning of Flow Maps",
    "abstract": "We present a method for learning neural representations of flow maps from\ntime-varying vector field data. The flow map is pervasive within the area of\nflow visualization, as it is foundational to numerous visualization techniques,\ne.g. integral curve computation for pathlines or streaklines, as well as\ncomputing separation/attraction structures within the flow field. Yet\nbottlenecks in flow map computation, namely the numerical integration of vector\nfields, can easily inhibit their use within interactive visualization settings.\nIn response, in our work we seek neural representations of flow maps that are\nefficient to evaluate, while remaining scalable to optimize, both in\ncomputation cost and data requirements. A key aspect of our approach is that we\ncan frame the process of representation learning not in optimizing for samples\nof the flow map, but rather, a self-consistency criterion on flow map\nderivatives that eliminates the need for flow map samples, and thus numerical\nintegration, altogether. Central to realizing this is a novel neural network\ndesign for flow maps, coupled with an optimization scheme, wherein our\nrepresentation only requires the time-varying vector field for learning,\nencoded as instantaneous velocity. We show the benefits of our method over\nprior works in terms of accuracy and efficiency across a range of 2D and 3D\ntime-varying vector fields, while showing how our neural representation of flow\nmaps can benefit unsteady flow visualization techniques such as streaklines,\nand the finite-time Lyapunov exponent.",

Even though AI-driven\ndigital agriculture can offer high-performing predictive functionalities, it\nlacks tangible quantitative evidence on its benefits to the farmers. Field\nexperiments can derive such evidence, but are often costly and time consuming.\nTo this end, we propose an observational causal inference framework for the\nempirical evaluation of the impact of digital tools on target farm performance\nindicators. This way, we can increase farmers' trust by enhancing the\ntransparency of the digital agriculture market, and in turn accelerate the\nadoption of technologies that aim to increase productivity and secure a\nsustainable and resilient agriculture against a changing climate. As a case\nstudy, we perform an empirical evaluation of a recommendation system for\noptimal cotton sowing, which was used by a farmers' cooperative during the\ngrowing season of 2021. We leverage agricultural knowledge to develop a causal\ngraph of the farm system, we use the back-door criterion to identify the impact\nof recommendations on the yield and subsequently estimate it using several\nmethods on observational data. The results show that a field sown according to\nour recommendations enjoyed a significant increase in yield (12% to 17%).",

Recent RGB-based methods opt to solve pose estimation problems using\nsmall datasets, making them more attractive for the X-ray domain where medical\ndata is scarcely available. We refine an existing RGB-based model\n(SingleShotPose) to estimate the 6D pose of a marked cube from grayscale X-ray\nimages by creating a generic solution trained on only real X-ray data and\nadjusted for X-ray acquisition geometry. The model regresses 2D control points\nand calculates the pose through 2D/3D correspondences using\nPerspective-n-Point(PnP), allowing a single trained model to be used across all\nsupporting cone-beam-based X-ray geometries. Since modern X-ray systems\ncontinuously adjust acquisition parameters during a procedure, it is essential\nfor such a pose estimation network to consider these parameters in order to be\ndeployed successfully and find a real use case. With a 5-cm/5-degree accuracy\nof 93% and an average 3D rotation error of 2.2 degrees, the results of the\nproposed approach are comparable with state-of-the-art alternatives, while\nrequiring significantly less real training examples and being applicable in\nreal-time applications.",

Nevertheless, at this point it is still largely unknown how to perform\nefficient machine unlearning of graph neural networks (GNNs); this is\nespecially the case when the number of training samples is small, in which case\nunlearning can seriously compromise the performance of the model. To address\nthis issue, we initiate the study of unlearning the Graph Scattering Transform\n(GST), a mathematical framework that is efficient, provably stable under\nfeature or graph topology perturbations, and offers graph classification\nperformance comparable to that of GNNs. Our main contribution is the first\nknown nonlinear approximate graph unlearning method based on GSTs.

Our third contribution are extensive simulation results which show\nthat, compared to complete retraining of GNNs after each removal request, the\nnew GST-based approach offers, on average, a $10.38$x speed-up and leads to a\n$2.6$% increase in test accuracy during unlearning of $90$ out of $100$\ntraining graphs from the IMDB dataset ($10$% training ratio).",

    "abstract": "Attention-based autoregressive models have achieved state-of-the-art\nperformance in various sequence-to-sequence tasks, including Text-To-Speech\n(TTS) and Neural Machine Translation (NMT), but can be difficult to train. The\nstandard training approach, teacher forcing, guides a model with the reference\nback-history. During inference, the generated back-history must be used. This\nmismatch limits the evaluation performance. Attention forcing has been\nintroduced to address the mismatch, guiding the model with the generated\nback-history and reference attention. While successful in tasks with continuous\noutputs like TTS, attention forcing faces additional challenges in tasks with\ndiscrete outputs like NMT. This paper introduces the two extensions of\nattention forcing to tackle these challenges. (1) Scheduled attention forcing\nautomatically turns attention forcing on and off, which is essential for tasks\nwith discrete outputs. (2) Parallel attention forcing makes training parallel,\nand is applicable to Transformer-based models. The experiments show that the\nproposed approaches improve the performance of models based on RNNs and\nTransformers.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental question in any peer-to-peer ride-sharing system is how to,\nboth effectively and efficiently, meet the request of passengers to balance the\nsupply and demand in real time. On the passenger side, traditional approaches\nfocus on pricing strategies by increasing the probability of users' call to\nadjust the distribution of demand. However, previous methods do not take into\naccount the impact of changes in strategy on future supply and demand changes,\nwhich means drivers are repositioned to different destinations due to\npassengers' calls, which will affect the driver's income for a period of time\nin the future. Motivated by this observation, we make an attempt to optimize\nthe distribution of demand to handle this problem by learning the long-term\nspatio-temporal values as a guideline for pricing strategy. In this study, we\npropose an offline deep reinforcement learning based method focusing on the\ndemand side to improve the utilization of transportation resources and customer\nsatisfaction. We adopt a spatio-temporal learning method to learn the value of\ndifferent time and location, then incentivize the ride requests of passengers\nto adjust the distribution of demand to balance the supply and demand in the\nsystem. In particular, we model the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).",

    "abstract": "This paper offers a new authentication algorithm based on image matching of\nnano-resolution visual identifiers with tree-shaped patterns. The algorithm\nincludes image-to-tree conversion by greedy extraction of the fractal pattern\nskeleton along with a custom-built graph matching algorithm that is robust\nagainst imaging artifacts such as scaling, rotation, scratch, and illumination\nchange. The proposed algorithm is applicable to a variety of tree-structured\nimage matching, but our focus is on dendrites, recently-developed visual\nidentifiers. Dendrites are entropy rich and unclonable with existing 2D and 3D\nprinters due to their natural randomness, nano-resolution granularity, and 3D\nfacets, making them an appropriate choice for security applications such as\nsupply chain trace and tracking. The proposed algorithm improves upon graph\nmatching with standard image descriptors. For instance, image inconsistency due\nto the camera sensor noise may cause unexpected feature extraction leading to\ninaccurate tree conversion and authentication failure. Also, previous tree\nextraction algorithms are prohibitively slow hindering their scalability to\nlarge systems. In this paper, we fix the current issues of [1] and accelerate\nthe key points extraction up to 10-times faster by implementing a new skeleton\nextraction method, a new key points searching algorithm, as well as an\noptimized key point matching algorithm. Using minimum enclosing circle and\ncenter points, make the algorithm robust to the choice of pattern shape. In\ncontrast to [1] our algorithm handles general graphs with loop connections,\ntherefore is applicable to a wider range of applications such as transportation\nmap analysis, fingerprints, and retina vessel imaging.",

This ability is owing to the compositional nature of language: we\ncan combine previously seen concepts to describe the new category. For example,\nwe might describe mavens as \"a kind of large birds with black feathers\", so\nthat others can use their knowledge of concepts \"large birds\" and \"black\nfeathers\" to recognize a maven. Inspired by this observation, in this work we\ntackle zero-shot classification task by logically parsing and reasoning on\nnatural language explanations. To this end, we propose the framework CLORE\n(Classification by LOgical Reasoning on Explanations). While previous methods\nusually regard textual information as implicit features, CLORE parses the\nexplanations into logical structure the and then reasons along this structure\non the input to produce a classification score. Experimental results on\nexplanation-based zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate that CLORE is\nsuperior to baselines, mainly because it performs better on tasks requiring\nmore logical reasoning.

To this end, the robots could be both physically soft with\nmultimodal sensing/perception, so that the robots could have better awareness\nof the surrounding environment, as well as to respond properly to humans'\naction/intention. This paper introduces a novel soft robotic link, named\nProTac, that possesses multiple sensing modes: tactile and proximity sensing,\nbased on computer vision and a functional material. These modalities come from\na layered structure of a soft transparent silicon skin, a polymer dispersed\nliquid crystal (PDLC) film, and reflective markers. Here, the PDLC film can\nswitch actively between the opaque and the transparent state, from which the\ntactile sensing and proximity sensing can be obtained by using cameras solely\nbuilt inside the ProTac link. In this paper, inference algorithms for tactile\nproximity perception are introduced. Evaluation results of two sensing\nmodalities demonstrated that, with a simple activation strategy, ProTac link\ncould effectively perceive useful information from both approaching and\nin-contact obstacles. The proposed sensing device is expected to bring in\nultimate solutions for design of robots with softness, whole-body and\nmultimodal sensing, and safety control strategies.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, multilingual pre-trained language models have gained\nprominence due to their remarkable performance on numerous downstream Natural\nLanguage Processing tasks (NLP). However, pre-training these large multilingual\nlanguage models requires a lot of training data, which is not available for\nAfrican Languages. Active learning is a semi-supervised learning algorithm, in\nwhich a model consistently and dynamically learns to identify the most\nbeneficial samples to train itself on, in order to achieve better optimization\nand performance on downstream tasks. Furthermore, active learning effectively\nand practically addresses real-world data scarcity. Despite all its benefits,\nactive learning, in the context of NLP and especially multilingual language\nmodels pretraining, has received little consideration. In this paper, we\npresent AfroLM, a multilingual language model pretrained from scratch on 23\nAfrican languages (the largest effort to date) using our novel self-active\nlearning framework. Pretrained on a dataset significantly (14x) smaller than\nexisting baselines, AfroLM outperforms many multilingual pretrained language\nmodels (AfriBERTa, XLMR-base, mBERT) on various NLP downstream tasks (NER, text\nclassification, and sentiment analysis). Additional out-of-domain sentiment\nanalysis experiments show that \\textbf{AfroLM} is able to generalize well\nacross various domains.

Modern approaches are\nmainly built on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and adapt models\npre-trained on large source domains to target domains using a few available\nsamples. In this paper, we make the first attempt to study when do DDPMs\noverfit and suffer severe diversity degradation as training data become scarce.\nThen we propose to adapt DDPMs pre-trained on large source domains to target\ndomains using limited data.

As a proof of concept, we implemented\nSLOPT-AFL++ by integrating SLOPT into AFL++ and showed that the\nprogram-agnostic optimization delivered by SLOPT enabled SLOPT-AFL++ to achieve\nhigher code coverage than AFL++ in all of ten real-world FuzzBench programs.\nMoreover, we ran SLOPT-AFL++ against several real-world programs from OSS-Fuzz\nand successfully identified three previously unknown vulnerabilities, even\nthough these programs have been fuzzed by AFL++ for a considerable number of\nCPU days on OSS-Fuzz.",

    "title": "Approximate Trace Reconstruction from a Single Trace",
    "abstract": "The well-known trace reconstruction problem is the problem of inferring an\nunknown source string $x \\in \\{0,1\\}^n$ from independent \"traces\", i.e. copies\nof $x$ that have been corrupted by a $\\delta$-deletion channel which\nindependently deletes each bit of $x$ with probability $\\delta$ and\nconcatenates the surviving bits. The current paper considers the extreme\ndata-limited regime in which only a single trace is provided to the\nreconstruction algorithm. In this setting exact reconstruction is of course\nimpossible, and the question is to what accuracy the source string $x$ can be\napproximately reconstructed.\nWe give a detailed study of this question, providing algorithms and lower\nbounds for the high, intermediate, and low deletion rate regimes in both the\nworst-case ($x$ is arbitrary) and average-case ($x$ is drawn uniformly from\n$\\{0,1\\}^n$) models. In several cases the lower bounds we establish are matched\nby computationally efficient algorithms that we provide.\nWe highlight our results for the high deletion rate regime: roughly speaking,\nthey show that\n- Having access to a single trace is already quite useful for worst-case\ntrace reconstruction: an efficient algorithm can perform much more accurate\nreconstruction, given one trace that is even only a few bits long, than it\ncould given no traces at all. But in contrast,\n- in the average-case setting, having access to a single trace is provably\nnot very useful: no algorithm, computationally efficient or otherwise, can\nachieve significantly higher accuracy given one trace that is $o(n)$ bits long\nthan it could with no traces.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale multiphysics simulations are computationally challenging due to\nthe coupling of multiple processes with widely disparate time scales. The\nadvent of exascale computing systems exacerbates these challenges, since these\nenable ever increasing size and complexity. Recently, there has been renewed\ninterest in developing multirate methods as a means to handle the large range\nof time scales, as these methods may afford greater accuracy and efficiency\nthan more traditional approaches of using IMEX and low-order operator splitting\nschemes. However, there have been few performance studies that compare\ndifferent classes of multirate integrators on complex application problems. We\nstudy the performance of several newly developed multirate infinitesimal (MRI)\nmethods, implemented in the SUNDIALS solver package, on two reacting flow model\nproblems built on structured mesh frameworks. The first model revisits the work\nof Emmet et al. (2014) on a compressible reacting flow problem with complex\nchemistry that is implemented using BoxLib but where we now include comparisons\nbetween a new explicit MRI scheme with the multirate spectral deferred\ncorrection (SDC) methods in the original paper. The second problem uses the\nsame complex chemistry as the first problem, combined with a simplified flow\nmodel, but run at a large spatial scale where explicit methods become\ninfeasible due to stability constraints. Two recently developed\nimplicit-explicit MRI multirate methods are tested. These methods rely on\nadvanced features of the AMReX framework on which the model is built, such as\nmultilevel grids and multilevel preconditioners. The results from these two\nproblems show that MRI multirate methods can offer significant performance\nbenefits on complex multiphysics application problems and that these methods\nmay be combined with advanced spatial discretization to compound the advantages\nof both.",

    "abstract": "As data visualizations have been increasingly applied in mass communication,\ndesigners often seek to grasp viewers immediately and motivate them to read\nmore. Such goals, as suggested by previous research, are closely associated\nwith the activation of emotion, namely affective arousal. Given this\nmotivation, this work takes initial steps toward understanding the\narousal-related factors in data visualization design. We collected a corpus of\n265 data visualizations and conducted a crowdsourcing study with 184\nparticipants during which the participants were asked to rate the affective\narousal elicited by data visualization design (all texts were blurred to\nexclude the influence of semantics) and provide their reasons. Based on the\ncollected data, first, we identified a set of arousal-related design features\nby analyzing user comments qualitatively. Then, we mapped these features to\ncomputable variables and constructed regression models to infer which features\nare significant contributors to affective arousal quantitatively. Through this\nexploratory study, we finally identified four design features (e.g.,\ncolorfulness, the number of different visual channels) cross-validated as\nimportant features correlated with affective arousal.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL), as a rapidly evolving privacy-preserving\ncollaborative machine learning paradigm, is a promising approach to enable edge\nintelligence in the emerging Industrial Metaverse. Even though many successful\nuse cases have proved the feasibility of FL in theory, in the industrial\npractice of Metaverse, the problems of non-independent and identically\ndistributed (non-i.i.d.) data, learning forgetting caused by streaming\nindustrial data, and scarce communication bandwidth remain key barriers to\nrealize practical FL. Facing the above three challenges simultaneously, this\npaper presents a high-performance and efficient system named HFEDMS for\nincorporating practical FL into Industrial Metaverse. HFEDMS reduces data\nheterogeneity through dynamic grouping and training mode conversion (Dynamic\nSequential-to-Parallel Training, STP). Then, it compensates for the forgotten\nknowledge by fusing compressed historical data semantics and calibrates\nclassifier parameters (Semantic Compression and Compensation, SCC). Finally,\nthe network parameters of the feature extractor and classifier are synchronized\nin different frequencies (Layer-wiseAlternative Synchronization Protocol, LASP)\nto reduce communication costs. These techniques make FL more adaptable to the\nheterogeneous streaming data continuously generated by industrial equipment,\nand are also more efficient in communication than traditional methods (e.g.,\nFederated Averaging). Extensive experiments have been conducted on the streamed\nnon-i.i.d. FEMNIST dataset using 368 simulated devices. Numerical results show\nthat HFEDMS improves the classification accuracy by at least 6.4% compared with\n8 benchmarks and saves both the overall runtime and transfer bytes by up to\n98%, proving its superiority in precision and efficiency.",

    "abstract": "This paper develops a framework for the design of scoring rules to optimally\nincentivize an agent to exert a multi-dimensional effort. This framework is a\ngeneralization to strategic agents of the classical knapsack problem (cf.\nBriest, Krysta, and V\\\"ocking, 2005, Singer, 2010) and it is foundational to\napplying algorithmic mechanism design to the classroom. The paper identifies\ntwo simple families of scoring rules that guarantee constant approximations to\nthe optimal scoring rule. The truncated separate scoring rule is the sum of\nsingle dimensional scoring rules that is truncated to the bounded range of\nfeasible scores. The threshold scoring rule gives the maximum score if reports\nexceed a threshold and zero otherwise. Approximate optimality of one or the\nother of these rules is similar to the bundling or selling separately result of\nBabaioff, Immorlica, Lucier, and Weinberg (2014). Finally, we show that the\napproximate optimality of the best of those two simple scoring rules is robust\nwhen the agent's choice of effort is made sequentially.",

    "abstract": "Traffic safety is important in reducing death and building a harmonious\nsociety. In addition to studies of accident incidences, the perception of\ndriving risk is significant in guiding the implementation of appropriate\ndriving countermeasures. Risk assessment can be conducted in real-time for\ntraffic safety due to the rapid development of communication technology and\ncomputing capabilities. This paper aims at the problems of difficult\ncalibration and inconsistent thresholds in the existing risk assessment\nmethods. It proposes a risk assessment model based on the potential field to\nquantify the driving risk of vehicles. Firstly, virtual energy is proposed as\nan attribute considering vehicle sizes and velocity. Secondly, the driving risk\nsurrogate(DRS) is proposed based on potential field theory to describe the risk\ndegree of vehicles. Risk factors are quantified by establishing submodels,\nincluding an interactive vehicle risk surrogate, a restrictions risk surrogate,\nand a speed risk surrogate. To unify the risk threshold, acceleration for\nimplementation guidance is derived from the risk field strength. Finally, a\nnaturalistic driving dataset in Nanjing, China, is selected, and 3063 pairs of\nfollowing naturalistic trajectories are screened out. Based on that, the\nproposed model and other models use for comparisons are calibrated through the\nimproved particle optimization algorithm. Simulations prove that the proposed\nmodel performs better than other algorithms in risk perception and response,\ncar-following trajectory, and velocity estimation. In addition, the proposed\nmodel exhibits better car-following ability than existing car-following models.",

    "title": "Fixing Model Bugs with Natural Language Patches",
    "abstract": "Current approaches for fixing systematic problems in NLP models (e.g. regex\npatches, finetuning on more data) are either brittle, or labor-intensive and\nliable to shortcuts. In contrast, humans often provide corrections to each\nother through natural language. Taking inspiration from this, we explore\nnatural language patches -- declarative statements that allow developers to\nprovide corrective feedback at the right level of abstraction, either\noverriding the model (``if a review gives 2 stars, the sentiment is negative'')\nor providing additional information the model may lack (``if something is\ndescribed as the bomb, then it is good''). We model the task of determining if\na patch applies separately from the task of integrating patch information, and\nshow that with a small amount of synthetic data, we can teach models to\neffectively use real patches on real data -- 1 to 7 patches improve accuracy by\n~1-4 accuracy points on different slices of a sentiment analysis dataset, and\nF1 by 7 points on a relation extraction dataset. Finally, we show that\nfinetuning on as many as 100 labeled examples may be needed to match the\nperformance of a small set of language patches.",

Our IGNR has\nthe benefit that it can represent graphons up to arbitrary resolutions, and\nenables natural and efficient generation of arbitrary sized graphs with desired\nstructure once the model is learned. Furthermore, we allow the input graph data\nto be unaligned and have different sizes by leveraging the Gromov-Wasserstein\ndistance. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of our model by showing its\nsuperior performance on a graphon learning task. We then propose an extension\nof IGNR that can be incorporated into an auto-encoder framework, and\ndemonstrate its good performance under a more general setting of graphon\nlearning.

To this end, we\npropose a novel pipeline, Cross-Domain Local Forensics (XDLF), for more general\ndeepfake video detection.

Moreover, the framework leverages four high-level forgery-sensitive\nlocal regions of a human face to guide the model to enhance subtle artifacts\nand localize potential anomalies. Extensive experiments on several benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate the impressive performance of our method, and we achieve\nsuperiority over several state-of-the-art methods on cross-dataset\ngeneralization.

To leverage the multi-sourced prior knowledge\nflexibly and to reduce negative transfer in AMTL, we customize a composite loss\nwith multiple differentiable ranking functions and optimize the loss through\nalternating optimization and the Frank-Wolfe algorithm. The uncertainty-based\nautomatic adjustment of hyper-parameters is also applied to eliminate the need\nof laborious hyper-parameter analysis during optimization.

However, delineating vectorized\nand regular building contours like a human does remains very challenging, due\nto the difficulty of the methodology, the diversity of building structures, and\nthe imperfect imaging conditions. In this paper, we propose the first\nend-to-end learnable building contour extraction framework, named BuildMapper,\nwhich can directly and efficiently delineate building polygons just as a human\ndoes. BuildMapper consists of two main components: 1) a contour initialization\nmodule that generates initial building contours; and 2) a contour evolution\nmodule that performs both contour vertex deformation and reduction, which\nremoves the need for complex empirical post-processing used in existing\nmethods. In both components, we provide new ideas, including a learnable\ncontour initialization method to replace the empirical methods, dynamic\npredicted and ground truth vertex pairing for the static vertex correspondence\nproblem, and a lightweight encoder for vertex information extraction and\naggregation, which benefit a general contour-based method; and a well-designed\nvertex classification head for building corner vertices detection, which casts\nlight on direct structured building contour extraction. We also built a\nsuitable large-scale building dataset, the WHU-Mix (vector) building dataset,\nto benefit the study of contour-based building extraction methods. The\nextensive experiments conducted on the WHU-Mix (vector) dataset, the WHU\ndataset, and the CrowdAI dataset verified that BuildMapper can achieve a\nstate-of-the-art performance, with a higher mask average precision (AP) and\nboundary AP than both segmentation-based and contour-based methods.",

Our method is able to\nlocalize whole-body keypoints accurately and tracks humans simultaneously given\ninaccurate bounding boxes and redundant detections. We show a significant\nimprovement over current state-of-the-art methods in both speed and accuracy on\nCOCO-wholebody, COCO, PoseTrack, and our proposed Halpe-FullBody pose\nestimation dataset.

    "abstract": "The ultimate goal of continuous sign language recognition(CSLR) is to\nfacilitate the communication between special people and normal people, which\nrequires a certain degree of real-time and deploy-ability of the model.\nHowever, in the previous research on CSLR, little attention has been paid to\nthe real-time and deploy-ability. In order to improve the real-time and\ndeploy-ability of the model, this paper proposes a zero parameter, zero\ncomputation temporal superposition crossover module(TSCM), and combines it with\n2D convolution to form a \"TSCM+2D convolution\" hybrid convolution, which\nenables 2D convolution to have strong spatial-temporal modelling capability\nwith zero parameter increase and lower deployment cost compared with other\nspatial-temporal convolutions. The overall CSLR model based on TSCM is built on\nthe improved ResBlockT network in this paper. The hybrid convolution of\n\"TSCM+2D convolution\" is applied to the ResBlock of the ResNet network to form\nthe new ResBlockT, and random gradient stop and multi-level CTC loss are\nintroduced to train the model, which reduces the final recognition WER while\nreducing the training memory usage, and extends the ResNet network from image\nclassification task to video recognition task. In addition, this study is the\nfirst in CSLR to use only 2D convolution extraction of sign language video\ntemporal-spatial features for end-to-end learning for recognition. Experiments\non two large-scale continuous sign language datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method and achieve highly competitive results.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based recommender systems may lead to over-fitting when lacking\ntraining interaction data. This over-fitting significantly degrades\nrecommendation performances. To address this data sparsity problem,\ncross-domain recommender systems (CDRSs) exploit the data from an auxiliary\nsource domain to facilitate the recommendation on the sparse target domain.\nMost existing CDRSs rely on overlapping users or items to connect domains and\ntransfer knowledge. However, matching users is an arduous task and may involve\nprivacy issues when data comes from different companies, resulting in a limited\napplication for the above CDRSs. Some studies develop CDRSs that require no\noverlapping users and items by transferring learned user interaction patterns.\nHowever, they ignore the bias in user interaction patterns between domains and\nhence suffer from an inferior performance compared with single-domain\nrecommender systems. In this paper, based on the above findings, we propose a\nnovel CDRS, namely semantic clustering enhanced debiasing graph neural\nrecommender system (SCDGN), that requires no overlapping users and items and\ncan handle the domain bias. More precisely, SCDGN semantically clusters items\nfrom both domains and constructs a cross-domain bipartite graph generated from\nitem clusters and users. Then, the knowledge is transferred via this\ncross-domain user-cluster graph from the source to the target. Furthermore, we\ndesign a debiasing graph convolutional layer for SCDGN to extract unbiased\nstructural knowledge from the cross-domain user-cluster graph. Our Experimental\nresults on three public datasets and a pair of proprietary datasets verify the\neffectiveness of SCDGN over state-of-the-art models in terms of cross-domain\nrecommendations.",

    "abstract": "Humans demonstrate a variety of interesting behavioral characteristics when\nperforming tasks, such as selecting between seemingly equivalent optimal\nactions, performing recovery actions when deviating from the optimal\ntrajectory, or moderating actions in response to sensed risks. However,\nimitation learning, which attempts to teach robots to perform these same tasks\nfrom observations of human demonstrations, often fails to capture such\nbehavior. Specifically, commonly used learning algorithms embody inherent\ncontradictions between the learning assumptions (e.g., single optimal action)\nand actual human behavior (e.g., multiple optimal actions), thereby limiting\nrobot generalizability, applicability, and demonstration feasibility. To\naddress this, this paper proposes designing imitation learning algorithms with\na focus on utilizing human behavioral characteristics, thereby embodying\nprinciples for capturing and exploiting actual demonstrator behavioral\ncharacteristics. This paper presents the first imitation learning framework,\nBayesian Disturbance Injection (BDI), that typifies human behavioral\ncharacteristics by incorporating model flexibility, robustification, and risk\nsensitivity. Bayesian inference is used to learn flexible non-parametric\nmulti-action policies, while simultaneously robustifying policies by injecting\nrisk-sensitive disturbances to induce human recovery action and ensuring\ndemonstration feasibility. Our method is evaluated through risk-sensitive\nsimulations and real-robot experiments (e.g., table-sweep task, shaft-reach\ntask and shaft-insertion task) using the UR5e 6-DOF robotic arm, to demonstrate\nthe improved characterisation of behavior. Results show significant improvement\nin task performance, through improved flexibility, robustness as well as\ndemonstration feasibility.",

We show\nthat complexity in the public coin model is upper bounded by Randomized query\nand Certificate complexity. On the other hand, it is lower bounded by\nfractional and randomized certificate complexity, making it a good candidate to\nprove strong lower bounds on randomized query complexity. Complexity in the\nprivate coin model is bounded from below by zero-error randomized query\ncomplexity.\nThe quantum measure highlights an interesting and surprising difference\nbetween classical and quantum query models. Whereas the public coin certificate\ngame complexity is bounded from above by randomized query complexity, the\nquantum certificate game complexity can be quadratically larger than quantum\nquery complexity. We use non-signaling, a notion from quantum information, to\ngive a lower bound of $n$ on the quantum certificate game complexity of the\n$OR$ function, whose quantum query complexity is $\\Theta(\\sqrt{n})$, then go on\nto show that this ``non-signaling bottleneck'' applies to all functions with\nhigh sensitivity, block sensitivity or fractional block sensitivity.\nWe consider the single-bit version of certificate games (inputs of the two\nplayers have Hamming distance $1$).

However, such scenarios\nare not systematically included in current open-source datasets, and this paper\nfills the gap accordingly. Based on the analysis and enumeration of trigger\nconditions, a high-quality diverse dataset is released, including various\nlong-tail traffic scenarios collected from multiple resources. Considering the\ndevelopment of probabilistic object detection (POD), this dataset marks trigger\nsources that may cause perception SOTIF problems in the scenarios as key\nobjects. In addition, an evaluation protocol is suggested to verify the\neffectiveness of POD algorithms in identifying the key objects via uncertainty.\nThe dataset never stops expanding, and the first batch of open-source data\nincludes 1126 frames with an average of 2.27 key objects and 2.47 normal\nobjects in each frame. To demonstrate how to use this dataset for SOTIF\nresearch, this paper further quantifies the perception SOTIF entropy to confirm\nwhether a scenario is unknown and unsafe for a perception system.

    "abstract": "Edge computing-based 3D perception has received attention in intelligent\ntransportation systems (ITS) because real-time monitoring of traffic candidates\npotentially strengthens Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) orchestration. Thanks to\nthe capability of precisely measuring the depth information on surroundings\nfrom LiDAR, the increasing studies focus on lidar-based 3D detection, which\nsignificantly promotes the development of 3D perception. Few methods met the\nreal-time requirement of edge deployment because of high computation-intensive\noperations.

Therefore, we proposed a 3D\nharmonic loss function to relieve the pointcloud based inconsistent\npredictions. Moreover, the feasibility of 3D harmonic loss is demonstrated from\na mathematical optimization perspective.

However, the majority of available\nsimulators are incapable of replicating traffic patterns that accurately\nreflect the various features of real-world data while also simulating\nhuman-like reactive responses to the tested autopilot driving strategies.\nTaking one step forward to addressing such a problem, we propose Realistic\nInteractive TrAffic flow (RITA) as an integrated component of existing driving\nsimulators to provide high-quality traffic flow for the evaluation and\noptimization of the tested driving strategies. RITA is developed with fidelity,\ndiversity, and controllability in consideration, and consists of two core\nmodules called RITABackend and RITAKit. RITABackend is built to support\nvehicle-wise control and provide traffic generation models from real-world\ndatasets, while RITAKit is developed with easy-to-use interfaces for\ncontrollable traffic generation via RITABackend. We demonstrate RITA's capacity\nto create diversified and high-fidelity traffic simulations in several highly\ninteractive highway scenarios.

To bridge the gap between\naudiovisual modalities, we learn a common subspace for them by utilizing the\nintrinsic correlation in the natural synchronization of audio-visual data with\nthe aid of annotated labels. TNN-CCCA is the best audio-visual cross-modal\nretrieval (AV-CMR) model so far, but the model training is sensitive to hard\nnegative samples when learning common subspace by applying triplet loss to\npredict the relative distance between inputs. In this paper, to reduce the\ninterference of hard negative samples in representation learning, we propose a\nnew AV-CMR model to optimize semantic features by directly predicting labels\nand then measuring the intrinsic correlation between audio-visual data using\ncomplete cross-triple loss. In particular, our model projects audio-visual\nfeatures into label space by minimizing the distance between predicted label\nfeatures after feature projection and ground label representations. Moreover,\nwe adopt complete cross-triplet loss to optimize the predicted label features\nby leveraging the relationship between all possible similarity and\ndissimilarity semantic information across modalities. The extensive\nexperimental results on two audio-visual double-checked datasets have shown an\nimprovement of approximately 2.1% in terms of average MAP over the current\nstate-of-the-art method TNN-CCCA for the AV-CMR task, which indicates the\neffectiveness of our proposed model.",

    "abstract": "Within an operational framework, covers used by a steganographer are likely\nto come from different sensors and different processing pipelines than the ones\nused by researchers for training their steganalysis models. Thus, a performance\ngap is unavoidable when it comes to out-of-distributions covers, an extremely\nfrequent scenario called Cover Source Mismatch (CSM). Here, we explore a grid\nof processing pipelines to study the origins of CSM, to better understand it,\nand to better tackle it. A set-covering greedy algorithm is used to select\nrepresentative pipelines minimizing the maximum regret between the\nrepresentative and the pipelines within the set. Our main contribution is a\nmethodology for generating relevant bases able to tackle operational CSM.\nExperimental validation highlights that, for a given number of training\nsamples, our set covering selection is a better strategy than selecting random\npipelines or using all the available pipelines. Our analysis also shows that\nparameters as denoising, sharpening, and downsampling are very important to\nfoster diversity. Finally, different benchmarks for classical and wild\ndatabases show the good generalization property of the extracted databases.\nAdditional resources are available at\ngithub.com/RonyAbecidan/HolisticSteganalysisWithSetCovering.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing demand for predictable and accountable Artificial\nIntelligence, the ability to explain or justify recommender systems results by\nspecifying how items are suggested, or why they are relevant, has become a\nprimary goal. However, current models do not explicitly represent the services\nand actors that the user might encounter during the overall interaction with an\nitem, from its selection to its usage. Thus, they cannot assess their impact on\nthe user's experience. To address this issue, we propose a novel justification\napproach that uses service models to (i) extract experience data from reviews\nconcerning all the stages of interaction with items, at different granularity\nlevels, and (ii) organize the justification of recommendations around those\nstages. In a user study, we compared our approach with baselines reflecting the\nstate of the art in the justification of recommender systems results. The\nparticipants evaluated the Perceived User Awareness Support provided by our\nservice-based justification models higher than the one offered by the\nbaselines. Moreover, our models received higher Interface Adequacy and\nSatisfaction evaluations by users having different levels of Curiosity or low\nNeed for Cognition (NfC). Differently, high NfC participants preferred a direct\ninspection of item reviews. These findings encourage the adoption of service\nmodels to justify recommender systems results but suggest the investigation of\npersonalization strategies to suit diverse interaction needs.",

We specifically\nconsider that both the transmitter and receiver are both equipped with an\nHMIMOS consisting of compact sub-wavelength TP patch antennas within the\nnear-field (NF) regime. To characterize TP MU-HMIMOS systems, a TP NF channel\nmodel is constructed using the dyadic Green's function, whose characteristics\nare leveraged to design two precoding schemes for mitigating the\ncross-polarization and inter-user interference contributions. Specifically, a\nuser-cluster-based precoding scheme assigns different users to one of three\npolarizations at the expense of the system's diversity, and a two-layer\nprecoding scheme removes interference using the Gaussian elimination method at\na high computational cost. The theoretical correlation analysis for HMIMOS in\nthe NF region is also investigated, revealing that both the spacing of transmit\npatch antennas and user distance impact transmit correlation factors. Our\nnumerical results show that the users far from transmitting HMIMOS experience\nhigher correlation than those closer within the NF regime, resulting in a lower\nchannel capacity. Meanwhile, in terms of channel capacity, TP HMIMOS can almost\nachieve 1.25 times gain compared with dual-polarized HMIMOS, and 3 times\ncompared with conventional HMIMOS. In addition, the proposed two-layer\nprecoding scheme combined with two-layer power allocation realizes a higher\nspectral efficiency than other schemes without sacrificing diversity.",

    "title": "Predictive Coding beyond Gaussian Distributions",
    "abstract": "A large amount of recent research has the far-reaching goal of finding\ntraining methods for deep neural networks that can serve as alternatives to\nbackpropagation (BP). A prominent example is predictive coding (PC), which is a\nneuroscience-inspired method that performs inference on hierarchical Gaussian\ngenerative models. These methods, however, fail to keep up with modern neural\nnetworks, as they are unable to replicate the dynamics of complex layers and\nactivation functions. In this work, we solve this problem by generalizing PC to\narbitrary probability distributions, enabling the training of architectures,\nsuch as transformers, that are hard to approximate with only Gaussian\nassumptions. We perform three experimental analyses. First, we study the gap\nbetween our method and the standard formulation of PC on multiple toy examples.\nSecond, we test the reconstruction quality on variational autoencoders, where\nour method reaches the same reconstruction quality as BP. Third, we show that\nour method allows us to train transformer networks and achieve a performance\ncomparable with BP on conditional language models. More broadly, this method\nallows neuroscience-inspired learning to be applied to multiple domains, since\nthe internal distributions can be flexibly adapted to the data, tasks, and\narchitectures used.",

Out of two and a half factors of our solution, the first factor\nstands for the private key, and the second and a half factor stands for\none-time passwords (OTPs) and their precursors, where OTPs are obtained from\nthe precursors (a.k.a., pre-images) by cryptographically secure hashing. We\ndescribe the protocol for bootstrapping our approach as well as the\nauthentication procedure. We make the security analysis of our solution, where\non top of the main attacker model that steals secrets from the client, we\nanalyze man-in-the-middle attacks and malware tampering with the client.

    "abstract": "The attention mechanism is considered the backbone of the widely-used\nTransformer architecture. It contextualizes the input by computing\ninput-specific attention matrices. We find that this mechanism, while powerful\nand elegant, is not as important as typically thought for pretrained language\nmodels. We introduce PAPA, a new probing method that replaces the\ninput-dependent attention matrices with constant ones -- the average attention\nweights over multiple inputs. We use PAPA to analyze several established\npretrained Transformers on six downstream tasks. We find that without any\ninput-dependent attention, all models achieve competitive performance -- an\naverage relative drop of only 8% from the probing baseline. Further, little or\nno performance drop is observed when replacing half of the input-dependent\nattention matrices with constant (input-independent) ones. Interestingly, we\nshow that better-performing models lose more from applying our method than\nweaker models, suggesting that the utilization of the input-dependent attention\nmechanism might be a factor in their success.

    "abstract": "To achieve high availability and low latency, distributed data stores often\ngeographically replicate data at multiple sites called replicas. However, this\nintroduces the data consistency problem. Due to the fundamental tradeoffs among\nconsistency, availability, and latency in the presence of network partition, no\na one-size-fits-all consistency model exists. To meet the needs of different\napplications, many popular data stores provide tunable consistency, allowing\nclients to specify the consistency level per individual operation. In this\npaper, we propose tunable causal consistency (TCC). It allows clients to choose\nthe desired session guarantee for each operation, from the well-known four\nsession guarantees, i.e., read your writes, monotonic reads, monotonic writes,\nand writes follow reads. Specifically, we first propose a formal specification\nof TCC in an extended (vis,ar) framework originally proposed by Burckhardt et\nal. Then we design a TCC protocol and develop a prototype distributed key-value\nstore called TCCSTORE. We evaluate TCCSTORE on Aliyun. The latency is less than\n38ms for all workloads and the throughput is up to about 2800 operations per\nsecond. We also show that TCC achieves better performance than causal\nconsistency and requires a negligible overhead when compared with eventual\nconsistency.",

    "abstract": "Numerous polluted groundwater sites across the globe require an active\nremediation strategy to restore natural environmental conditions and local\necosystem. The Engineered Nano-particles (ENPs) have emerged as an efficient\nreactive agent for the in-situ degradation of groundwater contaminants. While\nthe performance of these ENPs has been highly promising on the laboratory\nscale, their application in real field case conditions is still limited. The\ncomplex transport and retention mechanisms of ENPs hinder the development of an\nefficient remediation strategy. Therefore, a predictive tool for understanding\nthe transport and retention behavior of ENPs is highly required. The existing\ntools in the literature are dominated with numerical simulators, which have\nlimited flexibility and accuracy in the presence of sparse datasets. This work\nuses a dynamic, weight-enabled Physics-Informed Neural Network (dw-PINN)\nframework to model the nano-particle behavior within an aquifer. The result\nfrom the forward model demonstrates the effective capability of dw-PINN in\naccurately predicting the ENPs mobility. The model verification step shows that\nthe relative mean square error (MSE) of the predicted ENPs concentration using\ndw-PINN converges to a minimum value of $1.3{e^{-5}}$.

    "abstract": "With rapid advancements in electronic gadgets, the security and privacy\naspects of these devices are significant. For the design of secure systems,\nphysical unclonable function (PUF) and true random number generator (TRNG) are\ncritical hardware security primitives for security applications. This paper\nproposes novel implementations of PUF and TRNGs on the RRAM crossbar structure.\nFirstly, two techniques to implement the TRNG in the RRAM crossbar are\npresented based on write-back and 50% switching probability pulse. The\nrandomness of the proposed TRNGs is evaluated using the NIST test suite. Next,\nan architecture to implement the PUF in the RRAM crossbar is presented. The\ninitial entropy source for the PUF is used from TRNGs, and challenge-response\npairs (CRPs) are collected. The proposed PUF exploits the device variations and\nsneak-path current to produce unique CRPs. We demonstrate, through extensive\nexperiments, reliability of 100%, uniqueness of 47.78%, uniformity of 49.79%,\nand bit-aliasing of 48.57% without any post-processing techniques. Finally, the\ndesign is compared with the literature to evaluate its implementation\nefficiency, which is clearly found to be superior to the state-of-the-art.",

    "abstract": "While a vast number of location-based services appeared lately, indoor\npositioning solutions are developed to provide reliable position information in\nenvironments where traditionally used satellite-based positioning systems\ncannot provide access to accurate position estimates. Indoor positioning\nsystems can be based on many technologies; however, radio networks and more\nprecisely Wi-Fi networks seem to attract the attention of a majority of the\nresearch teams. The most widely used localization approach used in Wi-Fi-based\nsystems is based on fingerprinting framework. Fingerprinting algorithms,\nhowever, require a radio map for position estimation. This paper will describe\na solution for dynamic radio map creation, which is aimed to reduce the time\nrequired to build a radio map. The proposed solution is using measurements from\nIMUs (Inertial Measurement Units), which are processed with a particle filter\ndead reckoning algorithm. Reference points (RPs) generated by the implemented\ndead reckoning algorithm are then processed by the proposed reference point\nmerging algorithm, in order to optimize the radio map size and merge similar\nRPs. The proposed solution was tested in a real-world environment and evaluated\nby the implementation of deterministic fingerprinting positioning algorithms,\nand the achieved results were compared with results achieved with a static\nradio map. The achieved results presented in the paper show that positioning\nalgorithms achieved similar accuracy even with a dynamic map with a low density\nof reference points.",

    "abstract": "We show fast deterministic algorithms for fundamental problems on forests in\nthe challenging low-space regime of the well-known Massive Parallel Computation\n(MPC) model. A recent breakthrough result by Coy and Czumaj [STOC'22] shows\nthat, in this setting, it is possible to deterministically identify connected\ncomponents on graphs in $O(\\log D + \\log\\log n)$ rounds, where $D$ is the\ndiameter of the graph and $n$ the number of nodes. The authors left open a\nmajor question: is it possible to get rid of the additive $\\log\\log n$ factor\nand deterministically identify connected components in a runtime that is\ncompletely independent of $n$?\nWe answer the above question in the affirmative in the case of forests. We\ngive an algorithm that identifies connected components in $O(\\log D)$\ndeterministic rounds. The total memory required is $O(n+m)$ words, where $m$ is\nthe number of edges in the input graph, which is optimal as it is only enough\nto store the input graph. We complement our upper bound results by showing that\n$\\Omega(\\log D)$ time is necessary even for component-unstable algorithms,\nconditioned on the widely believed 1 vs. 2 cycles conjecture. Our techniques\nalso yield a deterministic forest-rooting algorithm with the same runtime and\nmemory bounds.\nFurthermore, we consider Locally Checkable Labeling problems (LCLs), whose\nsolution can be verified by checking the $O(1)$-radius neighborhood of each\nnode. We show that any LCL problem on forests can be solved in $O(\\log D)$\nrounds with a canonical deterministic algorithm, improving over the $O(\\log n)$\nruntime of Brandt, Latypov and Uitto [DISC'21]. We also show that there is no\nalgorithm that solves all LCL problems on trees asymptotically faster.",

    "abstract": "Climate change has become one of the biggest challenges of our time. Social\nmedia platforms such as Twitter play an important role in raising public\nawareness and spreading knowledge about the dangers of the current climate\ncrisis. With the increasing number of campaigns and communication about climate\nchange through social media, the information could create more awareness and\nreach the general public and policy makers. However, these Twitter\ncommunications lead to polarization of beliefs, opinion-dominated ideologies,\nand often a split into two communities of climate change deniers and believers.\nIn this paper, we propose a framework that helps identify denier statements on\nTwitter and thus classifies the stance of the tweet into one of the two\nattitudes towards climate change (denier/believer). The sentimental aspects of\nTwitter data on climate change are deeply rooted in general public attitudes\ntoward climate change. Therefore, our work focuses on learning two closely\nrelated tasks: Stance Detection and Sentiment Analysis of climate change\ntweets. We propose a multi-task framework that performs stance detection\n(primary task) and sentiment analysis (auxiliary task) simultaneously. The\nproposed model incorporates the feature-specific and shared-specific attention\nframeworks to fuse multiple features and learn the generalized features for\nboth tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed framework increases\nthe performance of the primary task, i.e., stance detection by benefiting from\nthe auxiliary task, i.e., sentiment analysis compared to its uni-modal and\nsingle-task variants.",

The bound depends on the distribution of the true error over the set of\nclassifier functions used for the given classification problem, and does not\nnecessarily depend on the size or complexity (e.g. the number of parameters) of\nthe classifier function set. This might explain the unexpectedly good\ngeneralization even of highly over-parameterized Neural Networks. We support\nour mathematical framework with experiments on a synthetic data set and a\nsubset of MNIST.",

    "abstract": "The adoption of wireless communications and, in particular, Wi-Fi, at the\nlowest level of the factory automation hierarchy has not increased as fast as\nexpected so far, mainly because of serious issues concerning determinism.\nActually, besides the random access scheme, disturbance and interference\nprevent reliable communication over the air and, as a matter of fact, make\nwireless networks unable to support distributed real-time control applications\nproperly. Several papers recently appeared in the literature suggest that\ndiversity could be leveraged to overcome this limitation effectively. In this\npaper a reference architecture is introduced, which describes how seamless\nlink-level redundancy can be applied to Wi-Fi. The framework is general enough\nto serve as a basis for future protocol enhancements, and also includes two\noptimizations aimed at improving the quality of wireless communication by\navoiding unnecessary replicated transmissions. Some relevant solutions have\nbeen analyzed by means of a thorough simulation campaign, in order to highlight\ntheir benefits when compared to conventional Wi-Fi. Results show that both\npacket losses and network latencies improve noticeably.",

    "abstract": "Tensor program tuning is a non-convex objective optimization problem, to\nwhich search-based approaches have proven to be effective. At the core of the\nsearch-based approaches lies the design of the cost model. Though deep\nlearning-based cost models perform significantly better than other methods,\nthey still fall short and suffer from the following problems. First, their\nfeature extraction heavily relies on expert-level domain knowledge in hardware\narchitectures. Even so, the extracted features are often unsatisfactory and\nrequire separate considerations for CPUs and GPUs. Second, a cost model trained\non one hardware platform usually performs poorly on another, a problem we call\ncross-hardware unavailability.\nIn order to address these problems, we propose TLP and MTLTLP. TLP is a deep\nlearning-based cost model that facilitates tensor program tuning. Instead of\nextracting features from the tensor program itself, TLP extracts features from\nthe schedule primitives. We treat schedule primitives as tensor languages. TLP\nis thus a Tensor Language Processing task. In this way, the task of predicting\nthe tensor program latency through the cost model is transformed into a natural\nlanguage processing (NLP) regression task. MTL-TLP combines Multi-Task Learning\nand TLP to cope with the cross-hardware unavailability problem.\nWe incorporate these techniques into the Ansor framework and conduct detailed\nexperiments. Results show that TLP can speed up the average search time by 9.1X\nand 3.0X on CPU and GPU workloads, respectively, compared to the\nstate-of-the-art implementation. MTL-TLP can achieve a speed-up of 4.7X and\n2.9X on CPU and GPU workloads, respectively, using only 7% of the target\nhardware data.",

As a\nbenefit of LDPC-based structure, information can be exchanged among clustered\nRF/antenna groups, which results in a low computational complexity order.\nAdvanced message passing (MP) capable of inferring and transferring data among\ndifferent paths is designed to support LDPC-based hybrid beamformer.

Owing\nto asynchronous information transfer of MARS-P, it reveals that higher power is\nrequired than that of MARS-S, which strikes a compelling balance between power\nconsumption, convergence, and computational complexity.

    "abstract": "The presence of bias in deep models leads to unfair outcomes for certain\ndemographic subgroups. Research in bias focuses primarily on facial recognition\nand attribute prediction with scarce emphasis on face detection. Existing\nstudies consider face detection as binary classification into 'face' and\n'non-face' classes. In this work, we investigate possible bias in the domain of\nface detection through facial region localization which is currently\nunexplored. Since facial region localization is an essential task for all face\nrecognition pipelines, it is imperative to analyze the presence of such bias in\npopular deep models. Most existing face detection datasets lack suitable\nannotation for such analysis. Therefore, we web-curate the Fair Face\nLocalization with Attributes (F2LA) dataset and manually annotate more than 10\nattributes per face, including facial localization information. Utilizing the\nextensive annotations from F2LA, an experimental setup is designed to study the\nperformance of four pre-trained face detectors. We observe (i) a high disparity\nin detection accuracies across gender and skin-tone, and (ii) interplay of\nconfounding factors beyond demography.

Furthermore,\nwe find that participants who trusted the AI less and engaged more with the\nlanguage and format of their prompts (e.g. re-phrasing, adjusting temperature)\nprovided code with fewer security vulnerabilities. Finally, in order to better\ninform the design of future AI-based Code assistants, we provide an in-depth\nanalysis of participants' language and interaction behavior, as well as release\nour user interface as an instrument to conduct similar studies in the future.",

    "abstract": "Systems for person re-identification (ReID) can achieve a high accuracy when\ntrained on large fully-labeled image datasets. However, the domain shift\ntypically associated with diverse operational capture conditions (e.g., camera\nviewpoints and lighting) may translate to a significant decline in performance.\nThis paper focuses on unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for video-based ReID\n- a relevant scenario that is less explored in the literature. In this\nscenario, the ReID model must adapt to a complex target domain defined by a\nnetwork of diverse video cameras based on tracklet information. State-of-art\nmethods cluster unlabeled target data, yet domain shifts across target cameras\n(sub-domains) can lead to poor initialization of clustering methods that\npropagates noise across epochs, thus preventing the ReID model to accurately\nassociate samples of same identity. In this paper, an UDA method is introduced\nfor video person ReID that leverages knowledge on video tracklets, and on the\ndistribution of frames captured over target cameras to improve the performance\nof CNN backbones trained using pseudo-labels. Our method relies on an\nadversarial approach, where a camera-discriminator network is introduced to\nextract discriminant camera-independent representations, facilitating the\nsubsequent clustering. In addition, a weighted contrastive loss is proposed to\nleverage the confidence of clusters, and mitigate the risk of incorrect\nidentity associations. Experimental results obtained on three challenging\nvideo-based person ReID datasets - PRID2011, iLIDS-VID, and MARS - indicate\nthat our proposed method can outperform related state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Residual minimization is a widely used technique for solving Partial\nDifferential Equations in variational form. It minimizes the dual norm of the\nresidual, which naturally yields a saddle-point (min-max) problem over the\nso-called trial and test spaces. Such min-max problem is highly non-linear, and\ntraditional methods often employ different mixed formulations to approximate\nit. Alternatively, it is possible to address the above saddle-point problem by\nemploying Adversarial Neural Networks: one network approximates the global\ntrial minimum, while another network seeks the test maximizer. However, this\napproach is numerically unstable due to a lack of continuity of the text\nmaximizers with respect to the trial functions as we approach the exact\nsolution. To overcome this, we reformulate the residual minimization as an\nequivalent minimization of a Ritz functional fed by optimal test functions\ncomputed from another Ritz functional minimization. The resulting Deep Double\nRitz Method combines two Neural Networks for approximating the trial and\noptimal test functions. Numerical results on several 1D diffusion and\nconvection problems support the robustness of our method up to the\napproximability and trainability capacity of the networks and the optimizer.",

However, several representation\nissues of embeddings can harm the measures' accuracy, including low-resource\nsettings and token frequency differences. In this work, we study what kind of\nembedding algorithm serves best to accurately measure types of social bias\nknown to exist in US online news articles. To cover the whole spectrum of\npolitical bias in the US, we collect 500k articles and review psychology\nliterature with respect to expected social bias. We then quantify social bias\nusing WEAT along with embedding algorithms that account for the aforementioned\nissues. We compare how models trained with the algorithms on news articles\nrepresent the expected social bias.

The hyperbolic\ngeometry has been shown to capture the hierarchical patterns due to its\ntree-like metrics, which addressed the limitations of the Euclidean embedding\nmodels. Recent explorations of the complex hyperbolic geometry further improved\nthe hyperbolic embeddings for capturing a variety of hierarchical structures.\nHowever, the performance of the hyperbolic KG embedding models for\nnon-transitive relations is still unpromising, while the complex hyperbolic\nembeddings do not deal with multi-relations. This paper aims to utilize the\nrepresentation capacity of the complex hyperbolic geometry in multi-relational\nKG embeddings.

    "abstract": "Commonly used AI networks are very self-confident in their predictions, even\nwhen the evidence for a certain decision is dubious. The investigation of a\ndeep learning model output is pivotal for understanding its decision processes\nand assessing its capabilities and limitations. By analyzing the distributions\nof raw network output vectors, it can be observed that each class has its own\ndecision boundary and, thus, the same raw output value has different support\nfor different classes. Inspired by this fact, we have developed a new method\nfor out-of-distribution detection. The method offers an explanatory step beyond\nsimple thresholding of the softmax output towards understanding and\ninterpretation of the model learning process and its output. Instead of\nassigning the class label of the highest logit to each new sample presented to\nthe network, it takes the distributions over all classes into consideration. A\nprobability score interpreter (PSI) is created based on the joint logit values\nin relation to their respective correct vs wrong class distributions. The PSI\nsuggests whether the sample is likely to belong to a specific class, whether\nthe network is unsure, or whether the sample is likely an outlier or unknown\ntype for the network. The simple PSI has the benefit of being applicable on\nalready trained networks. The distributions for correct vs wrong class for each\noutput node are established by simply running the training examples through the\ntrained network. We demonstrate our OOD detection method on a challenging\ntransmission electron microscopy virus image dataset.

In this paper, we\nfirst demonstrate that egocentric visual information is helpful for noise\nsuppression.

    "abstract": "End-to-end (E2E) task-oriented dialogue (ToD) systems are prone to fall into\nthe so-called 'likelihood trap', resulting in generated responses which are\ndull, repetitive, and often inconsistent with dialogue history. Comparing\nranked lists of multiple generated responses against the 'gold response' (from\ntraining data) reveals a wide diversity in response quality, with many good\nresponses placed lower in the ranked list. The main challenge, addressed in\nthis work, is then how to reach beyond greedily generated system responses,\nthat is, how to obtain and select such high-quality responses from the list of\novergenerated responses at inference without availability of the gold response.\nTo this end, we propose a simple yet effective reranking method which aims to\nselect high-quality items from the lists of responses initially overgenerated\nby the system. The idea is to use any sequence-level (similarity) scoring\nfunction to divide the semantic space of responses into high-scoring versus\nlow-scoring partitions. At training, the high-scoring partition comprises all\ngenerated responses whose similarity to the gold response is higher than the\nsimilarity of the greedy response to the gold response. At inference, the aim\nis to estimate the probability that each overgenerated response belongs to the\nhigh-scoring partition, given only previous dialogue history. We validate the\nrobustness and versatility of our proposed method on the standard MultiWOZ\ndataset: our methods improve a state-of-the-art E2E ToD system by 2.4 BLEU, 3.2\nROUGE, and 2.8 METEOR scores, achieving new peak results. Additional\nexperiments on the BiTOD dataset and human evaluation further ascertain the\ngeneralisability and effectiveness of the proposed framework.",

    "title": "A DNA Based Colour Image Encryption Scheme Using A Convolutional  Autoencoder",
    "abstract": "With the advancement in technology, digital images can easily be transmitted\nand stored over the Internet. Encryption is used to avoid illegal interception\nof digital images. Encrypting large-sized colour images in their original\ndimension generally results in low encryption/decryption speed along with\nexerting a burden on the limited bandwidth of the transmission channel. To\naddress the aforementioned issues, a new encryption scheme for colour images\nemploying convolutional autoencoder, DNA and chaos is presented in this paper.\nThe proposed scheme has two main modules, the dimensionality conversion module\nusing the proposed convolutional autoencoder, and the encryption/decryption\nmodule using DNA and chaos. The dimension of the input colour image is first\nreduced from N $\\times$ M $\\times$ 3 to P $\\times$ Q gray-scale image using the\nencoder. Encryption and decryption are then performed in the reduced dimension\nspace. The decrypted gray-scale image is upsampled to obtain the original\ncolour image having dimension N $\\times$ M $\\times$ 3. The training and\nvalidation accuracy of the proposed autoencoder is 97% and 95%, respectively.\nOnce the autoencoder is trained, it can be used to reduce and subsequently\nincrease the dimension of any arbitrary input colour image. The efficacy of the\ndesigned autoencoder has been demonstrated by the successful reconstruction of\nthe compressed image into the original colour image with negligible perceptual\ndistortion. The second major contribution presented in this paper is an image\nencryption scheme using DNA along with multiple chaotic sequences and\nsubstitution boxes. The security of the proposed image encryption algorithm has\nbeen gauged using several evaluation parameters, such as histogram of the\ncipher image, entropy, NPCR, UACI, key sensitivity, contrast, etc. encryption.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we are interested in learning a generalizable person\nre-identification (re-ID) representation from unlabeled videos. Compared with\n1) the popular unsupervised re-ID setting where the training and test sets are\ntypically under the same domain, and 2) the popular domain generalization (DG)\nre-ID setting where the training samples are labeled, our novel scenario\ncombines their key challenges: the training samples are unlabeled, and\ncollected form various domains which do no align with the test domain. In other\nwords, we aim to learn a representation in an unsupervised manner and directly\nuse the learned representation for re-ID in novel domains. To fulfill this\ngoal, we make two main contributions: First, we propose Cycle Association\n(CycAs), a scalable self-supervised learning method for re-ID with low training\ncomplexity; and second, we construct a large-scale unlabeled re-ID dataset\nnamed LMP-video, tailored for the proposed method. Specifically, CycAs learns\nre-ID features by enforcing cycle consistency of instance association between\ntemporally successive video frame pairs, and the training cost is merely linear\nto the data size, making large-scale training possible. On the other hand, the\nLMP-video dataset is extremely large, containing 50 million unlabeled person\nimages cropped from over 10K Youtube videos, therefore is sufficient to serve\nas fertile soil for self-supervised learning. Trained on LMP-video, we show\nthat CycAs learns good generalization towards novel domains. The achieved\nresults sometimes even outperform supervised domain generalizable models.\nRemarkably, CycAs achieves 82.2\\% Rank-1 on Market-1501 and 49.0\\% Rank-1 on\nMSMT17 with zero human annotation, surpassing state-of-the-art supervised DG\nre-ID methods. Moreover, we also demonstrate the superiority of CycAs under the\ncanonical unsupervised re-ID and the pretrain-and-finetune scenarios.",

For addressing\noccluded ReID, part-based methods have been shown beneficial as they offer\nfine-grained information and are well suited to represent partially visible\nhuman bodies. However, training a part-based model is a challenging task for\ntwo reasons. Firstly, individual body part appearance is not as discriminative\nas global appearance (two distinct IDs might have the same local appearance),\nthis means standard ReID training objectives using identity labels are not\nadapted to local feature learning. Secondly, ReID datasets are not provided\nwith human topographical annotations. In this work, we propose BPBreID, a body\npart-based ReID model for solving the above issues. We first design two modules\nfor predicting body part attention maps and producing body part-based features\nof the ReID target.

This question has been\ninvestigated thoroughly under the framework of differential privacy. However,\nmost of the literature has not focused on settings where the amount of data is\nso large that we are not able to compute the exact answer in the non-private\nsetting (such as in the streaming setting, sublinear-time setting, etc.). This\ncan often make the use of differential privacy unfeasible in practice. In this\npaper, we show a general approach for making Monte-Carlo randomized\napproximation algorithms differentially private. We only need to assume the\nerror $R$ of the approximation algorithm is sufficiently concentrated around\n$0$ (e.g.\\ $E[|R|]$ is bounded) and that the function being approximated has a\nsmall global sensitivity $\\Delta$.\nFirst, we show that if the error is subexponential, then the Laplace\nmechanism with error magnitude proportional to the sum of $\\Delta$ and the\n\\emph{subexponential diameter} of the error of the algorithm makes the\nalgorithm differentially private. This is true even if the worst-case global\nsensitivity of the algorithm is large or even infinite. We then introduce a new\nadditive noise mechanism, which we call the zero-symmetric Pareto mechanism. We\nshow that using this mechanism, we can make an algorithm differentially private\neven if we only assume a bound on the first absolute moment of the error\n$E[|R|]$.\nFinally, we use our results to give the first differentially private\nalgorithms for various problems.

    "abstract": "We present a framework for the design of distorting mechanisms that allow\nremotely operating anomaly detectors in a privacy-preserving fashion. We\nconsider the problem setting in which a remote station seeks to identify\nanomalies using system input-output signals transmitted over communication\nnetworks. However, in such a networked setting, it is not desired to disclose\ntrue data of the system operation as it can be used to infer private\ninformation -- modeled here as a system private output. To prevent accurate\nestimation of private outputs by adversaries, we pass original signals through\ndistorting (privacy-preserving) mechanisms and send the distorted data to the\nremote station (which inevitably leads to degraded monitoring performance). The\ndesign of these mechanisms is formulated as a privacy-utility (tradeoff)\nproblem where system utility is characterized by anomaly detection performance,\nand privacy is quantified using information-theoretic metrics (mutual\ninformation and differential entropy). We cast the synthesis of dependent\nGaussian mechanisms as the solution of a convex program (log-determinant cost\nwith linear matrix inequality constraints) where we seek to maximize privacy\nover a finite window of realizations while guaranteeing a bound on monitoring\nperformance degradation. We provide simulation results to illustrate the\nperformance of the developed tools.",

    "title": "Learning For Predictive Control: A Dual Gaussian Process Approach",
    "abstract": "An important issue in model-based control design is that an accurate dynamic\nmodel of the system is generally nonlinear, complex, and costly to obtain. This\nlimits achievable control performance in practice. Gaussian process (GP) based\nestimation of system models is an effective tool to learn unknown dynamics\ndirectly from input/output data. However, conventional GP-based control methods\noften ignore the computational cost associated with accumulating data during\nthe operation of the system and how to handle forgetting in continuous\nadaption. In this paper, we present a novel Dual Gaussian Process (DGP) based\nmodel predictive control (MPC) strategy that enables efficient use of online\nlearning based predictive control without the danger of catastrophic\nforgetting. The bio-inspired DGP structure is a combination of a long-term GP\nand a short-term GP, where the long-term GP is used to keep the learned\nknowledge in memory and the short-term GP is employed to rapidly compensate\nunknown dynamics during online operation. Furthermore, a novel recursive online\nupdate strategy for the short-term GP is proposed to successively improve the\nlearnt model during online operation. Effectiveness of the proposed strategy is\ndemonstrated via numerical simulations.",

Various prevention\nmeasures were introduced around the world to limit the transmission of the\ndisease, including face masks, mandates for social distancing and regular\ndisinfection in public spaces, and the use of screening applications. These\ndevelopments also triggered the need for novel and improved computer vision\ntechniques capable of (i) providing support to the prevention measures through\nan automated analysis of visual data, on the one hand, and (ii) facilitating\nnormal operation of existing vision-based services, such as biometric\nauthentication schemes, on the other.

Such computer vision based human analysis techniques\ninclude face and face-mask detection approaches, face recognition techniques,\ncrowd counting solutions, age and expression estimation procedures, models for\ndetecting face-hand interactions and many others, and have seen considerable\nattention over recent years. The goal of this survey is to provide an\nintroduction to the problems induced by COVID-19 into such research and to\npresent a comprehensive review of the work done in the computer vision based\nhuman analysis field.

This paper leverages\nan augmentation-speed tradeoff to significantly speed up consistent network\nupdates. We show that allowing for a small and short (hence practically\ntolerable, e.g., using buffering) oversubscription of links allows us to solve\nmany network update instances much faster, as well as to reduce computational\ncomplexities (i.e., the running times of the algorithms). We first explore this\ntradeoff formally, revealing the computational complexity of scheduling\nupdates. We then present and analyze algorithms that maintain logical and\nperformance properties during the update. Using an extensive simulation study,\nwe find that the tradeoff is even more favorable in practice than our\nanalytical bounds suggest. In particular, we find that by allowing just 10%\naugmentation, update times reduce by more than 32% on average, across a\nspectrum of real-world networks.",

We obtain tight bounds for this problem under almost all\nparameter regimes.

Our results demonstrate interesting phase\ntransitions for $m$ and the privacy parameter $\\varepsilon$ in the estimation\nrisk.

By transfer learning, high adaptivity to user difference and sensor\nvariation were achieved at an average accuracy up to 97%. We further\ndemonstrated RMG to monitor eye and leg muscles and achieved high accuracy for\neye movement and body postures tracking.

    "abstract": "The success of AlphaZero (AZ) has demonstrated that neural-network-based Go\nAIs can surpass human performance by a large margin. Given that the state space\nof Go is extremely large and a human player can play the game from any legal\nstate, we ask whether adversarial states exist for Go AIs that may lead them to\nplay surprisingly wrong actions. In this paper, we first extend the concept of\nadversarial examples to the game of Go: we generate perturbed states that are\n``semantically'' equivalent to the original state by adding meaningless moves\nto the game, and an adversarial state is a perturbed state leading to an\nundoubtedly inferior action that is obvious even for Go beginners. However,\nsearching the adversarial state is challenging due to the large, discrete, and\nnon-differentiable search space. To tackle this challenge, we develop the first\nadversarial attack on Go AIs that can efficiently search for adversarial states\nby strategically reducing the search space. This method can also be extended to\nother board games such as NoGo. Experimentally, we show that the actions taken\nby both Policy-Value neural network (PV-NN) and Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS)\ncan be misled by adding one or two meaningless stones; for example, on 58\\% of\nthe AlphaGo Zero self-play games, our method can make the widely used KataGo\nagent with 50 simulations of MCTS plays a losing action by adding two\nmeaningless stones. We additionally evaluated the adversarial examples found by\nour algorithm with amateur human Go players and 90\\% of examples indeed lead\nthe Go agent to play an obviously inferior action.

    "abstract": "Objective: Dyspnea is one of the most common symptoms for many pulmonary\ndiseases including COVID-19. Clinical assessment of dyspnea is mainly performed\nby subjective self-report, which has limited accuracy and is challenging for\ncontinuous monitoring. The objective of this research study is to determine if\ndyspnea progression in COVID patients can be assessed using a non-invasive\nwearable sensor and if the findings are comparable to a learning model of\nphysiologically induced dyspnea on healthy subjects. Methods: Non-invasive\nwearable respiratory sensors were employed to retrieve continuous respiratory\ncharacteristics with user comfort and convenience. Overnight (~16h) respiratory\nwaveforms were collected on 12 COVID-19 patients, and a benchmark on 13 healthy\nsubjects with exertion-induced dyspnea were also performed for blind\ncomparison. The learning model was built from the respiratory features with\nself report on 32 healthy subjects under exertion and airway blockage. Results:\nHigh similarity between dyspnea on COVID patients and physiologically induced\ndyspnea on healthy subjects was established. COVID patients have consistently\nhigh objective dyspnea scores in comparison with normal breathing of healthy\nsubjects. We also exhibited continuous dyspnea scoring capability for 12-16\nhours on patients. Conclusion: This paper validates the viability to use our\nobjective dyspnea scoring for clinical dyspnea assessment on COVID patients.\nSignificance: The proposed system can help the identification of dyspneic\nexacerbation in conditions such as COVID, leading to early intervention and\npossibly improving their outcome. This approach can be potentially applied to\nother pulmonary disorders such as asthma, emphysema, and pneumonia.",

    "abstract": "One of the challenges for climbing gyms is to find out popular routes for the\nclimbers to improve their services and optimally use their infrastructure. This\nproblem must be addressed preserving both the privacy and convenience of the\nclimbers and the costs of the gyms. To this aim, a hardware prototype is\ndeveloped to collect data using accelerometer sensors attached to a piece of\nclimbing equipment mounted on the wall, called quickdraw, that connects the\nclimbing rope to the bolt anchors. The corresponding sensors are configured to\nbe energy-efficient, hence becoming practical in terms of expenses and time\nconsumption for replacement when used in large quantities in a climbing gym.\nThis paper describes hardware specifications, studies data measured by the\nsensors in ultra-low power mode, detect patterns in data during climbing\ndifferent routes, and develops an unsupervised approach for route clustering.",

The ego-noise reference signals are captured with microphones located\nnear the UAV's propellers and used in the prior knowledge multichannel Wiener\nfilter (PK-MWF) to obtain the speech correlation matrix estimate. Speech\npresence probability (SPP) can be estimated for detecting speech activity from\nan external microphone near the speech source, providing a performance\nbenchmark, or from one of the embedded microphones, assuming a more realistic\nscenario. Experimental measurements are performed in a semi-anechoic chamber,\nwith a UAV mounted on a stand and a loudspeaker playing a speech signal, while\nsetting three distinct and fixed propeller rotation speeds, resulting in three\ndifferent signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The recordings obtained and made\navailable online are used to compare the proposed method to the use of the\nstandard multichannel Wiener filter (MWF) estimated with and without the\npropellers' microphones being used in its formulation.

    "abstract": "In high dimensional variable selection problems, statisticians often seek to\ndesign multiple testing procedures controlling the false discovery rate (FDR)\nand simultaneously discovering more relevant variables. Model-X methods, such\nas Knockoffs and conditional randomization tests, achieve the first goal of\nfinite-sample FDR control under the assumption of known covariates\ndistribution. However, it is not clear whether these methods can concurrently\nachieve the second goal of maximizing the number of discoveries. In fact,\ndesigning procedures to discover more relevant variables with finite-sample FDR\ncontrol is a largely open question, even in the arguably simplest linear\nmodels.\nIn this paper, we derive near-optimal testing procedures in high dimensional\nBayesian linear models with isotropic covariates. We propose a Model-X multiple\ntesting procedure, PoEdCe, which provably controls the frequentist FDR from\nfinite samples even under model misspecification, and conjecturally achieves\nnear-optimal power when the data follow the Bayesian linear model with a known\nprior. PoEdCe has three important ingredients: Posterior Expectation, distilled\nConditional randomization test (dCRT), and the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure\nwith e-values (eBH). The optimality conjecture of PoEdCe is based on a\nheuristic calculation of its asymptotic true positive proportion (TPP) and\nfalse discovery proportion (FDP), which is supported by methods from\nstatistical physics as well as extensive numerical simulations. Furthermore,\nwhen the prior is unknown, we show that an empirical Bayes variant of PoEdCe\nstill has finite-sample FDR control and achieves near-optimal power.",

    "abstract": "Obtaining accurate high-resolution representations of model outputs is\nessential to describe the system dynamics. In general, however, only spatially-\nand temporally-coarse observations of the system states are available. These\nobservations can also be corrupted by noise. Downscaling is a process/scheme in\nwhich one uses coarse scale observations to reconstruct the high-resolution\nsolution of the system states. Continuous Data Assimilation (CDA) is a recently\nintroduced downscaling algorithm that constructs an increasingly accurate\nrepresentation of the system states by continuously nudging the large scales\nusing the coarse observations. We introduce a Discrete Data Assimilation (DDA)\nalgorithm as a downscaling algorithm based on CDA with discrete-in-time\nnudging. We then investigate the performance of the CDA and DDA algorithms for\ndownscaling noisy observations of the Rayleigh-B\\'enard convection system in\nthe chaotic regime. In this computational study, a set of noisy observations\nwas generated by perturbing a reference solution with Gaussian noise before\ndownscaling them. The downscaled fields are then assessed using various error-\nand ensemble-based skill scores. The CDA solution was shown to converge towards\nthe reference solution faster than that of DDA but at the cost of a higher\nasymptotic error. The numerical results also suggest a quadratic relationship\nbetween the $\\ell_2$ error and the noise level for both CDA and DDA.

    "abstract": "Personalized speech enhancement (PSE) models achieve promising results\ncompared with unconditional speech enhancement models due to their ability to\nremove interfering speech in addition to background noise. Unlike unconditional\nspeech enhancement, causal PSE models may occasionally remove the target speech\nby mistake. The PSE models also tend to leak interfering speech when the target\nspeaker is silent for an extended period. We show that existing PSE methods\nsuffer from a trade-off between speech over-suppression and interference\nleakage by addressing one problem at the expense of the other. We propose a new\nPSE model training framework using cross-task knowledge distillation to\nmitigate this trade-off. Specifically, we utilize a personalized voice activity\ndetector (pVAD) during training to exclude the non-target speech frames that\nare wrongly identified as containing the target speaker with hard or soft\nclassification. This prevents the PSE model from being too aggressive while\nstill allowing the model to learn to suppress the input speech when it is\nlikely to be spoken by interfering speakers. Comprehensive evaluation results\nare presented, covering various PSE usage scenarios.",

Striking examples include pulse design\nfor exciting spin ensembles in quantum physics, neurostimulation for relieving\nneurological disorder symptoms, and path planning for steering robot swarms.\nHowever, the control targets in such applications are generally large-scale\ncomplex and severely underactuated ensemble systems, research into which\nstretches the capability of techniques in classical control and dynamical\nsystems theory to the very limit. This paper then devotes to advancing our\nknowledge about controllability of linear ensemble systems by integrating tools\nin modern algebra into the technique of separating points developed in our\nrecent work. In particular, we give an algebraic interpretation of the dynamics\nof linear systems in terms of actions of polynomials on vector spaces, and this\nleads to the development of the functional canonical form of matrix-valued\nfunctions, which can also be viewed as the generalization of the rational\ncanonical form of matrices in linear algebra. Then, leveraging the technique of\nseparating points, we achieve a necessary and sufficient characterization of\nuniform ensemble controllability for time-invariant linear ensemble systems as\nthe ensemble controllability canonical form, in which the system and control\nmatrices are in the functional canonical and block diagonal form, respectively.\nThis work successfully launches a new research scheme by adopting and tailoring\nfinite-dimensional methods to tackle control problems involving\ninfinite-dimensional ensemble systems, and lays a solid foundation for a more\ninclusive ensemble control theory targeting a much broader spectrum of control\nand learning problems in both scientific research and practice.",

A noticeable area of advancement is the computation of\nturbulent, two-phase flows resulting from wave breaking and other multiphase\nflow processes such as cavitation that can generate underwater sound and\nentrain bubbles in ship wakes, among other effects. Although advanced flow\nsolvers are sophisticated and are capable of simulating high Reynolds number\nflows on large numbers of grid points, challenges in data analysis remain.\nSpecifically, there is a critical need to transform highly resolved flow fields\ndescribed on fine grids at discrete time steps into physically resolved\nfeatures for which the flow dynamics can be understood and utilized in naval\napplications.

In previous\nworks, we developed a novel algorithm to track bubbles in breaking wave\nsimulations and to interpret their dynamical behavior over time (Gao et al.,\n2021a). We also discovered a new physical mechanism driving bubble production\nwithin breaking wave crests (Gao et al., 2021b) and developed a model to relate\nbubble behaviors to underwater sound generation (Gao et al., 2021c).

The critical problem for preserving\nbackground sound in VC is inevitable speech distortion by the neural separation\nmodel and the cascade mismatch between the source separation model and the VC\nmodel. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end framework via multi-task\nlearning which sequentially cascades a source separation (SS) module, a\nbottleneck feature extraction module and a VC module. Specifically, the source\nseparation task explicitly considers critical phase information and confines\nthe distortion caused by the imperfect separation process. The source\nseparation task, the typical VC task and the unified task shares a uniform\nreconstruction loss constrained by joint training to reduce the mismatch\nbetween the SS and VC modules.

One solution to mitigate these concerns involves\nconcealing speaker identities before sharing speech data, also referred to as\nspeaker anonymization. In our previous work, we have developed an automatic\nspeaker verification (ASV)-model-free anonymization framework to protect\nspeaker privacy while preserving speech intelligibility.

To address this issue, in this paper, we directly model the\nformant distribution and fundamental frequency (F0) to represent speaker\nidentity and anonymize the source speech by the uniformly scaling formant and\nF0. By directly scaling the formant and F0, the speaker distinguishability\ndegradation of the anonymized speech caused by the introduction of other\nspeakers is prevented. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed\nframework can improve the speaker distinguishability and significantly\noutperforms our previous framework in voice distinctiveness.

The reconstruction of any\ndataset by the autoencoder can be considered as a complex regression process.\nIn regression analysis, outliers can usually be divided into high leverage\npoints and influential points. Although the autoencoder has shown good results\nfor the identification of influential points, there are still some problems\nwhen detect high leverage points. Through theoretical derivation, we found that\nmost outliers are detected in the direction corresponding to the\nworst-recovered principal component, but in the direction of the well-recovered\nprincipal components, the anomalies are often ignored. We propose a new loss\nfunction which solve the above deficiencies in outlier detection. The core idea\nof our scheme is that in order to better detect high leverage points, we should\nsuppress the complete reconstruction of the dataset to convert high leverage\npoints into influential points, and it is also necessary to ensure that the\ndifferences between the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the original\ndataset and their corresponding reconstructed results in the direction of each\nprincipal component are equal.

Using Louisiana pedestrian fatal and injury crash data\n(2010-2019), this study applied Association Rules Mining (ARM) to identify the\nhidden pattern of crash risk factors according to three different lighting\nconditions (daylight, dark-with-streetlight, and dark-no-streetlight). Based on\nthe generated rules, the results show that daylight pedestrian crashes are\nassociated with children (less than 15 years), senior pedestrians (greater than\n64 years), older drivers (>64 years), and other driving behaviors such as\nfailure to yield, inattentive/distracted, illness/fatigue/asleep. Additionally,\nyoung drivers (15-24 years) are involved in severe pedestrian crashes in\ndaylight conditions. This study also found pedestrian alcohol/drug involvement\nas the most frequent item in the dark-with-streetlight condition. This crash\ntype is particularly associated with pedestrian action (crossing\nintersection/midblock), driver age (55-64 years), speed limit (30-35 mph), and\nspecific area type (business with mixed residential area). Fatal pedestrian\ncrashes are found to be associated with roadways with high-speed limits (>50\nmph) during the dark without streetlight condition. Some other risk factors\nlinked with high-speed limit related crashes are pedestrians walking\nwith/against the traffic, presence of pedestrian dark clothing, pedestrian\nalcohol/drug involvement. The research findings are expected to provide an\nimproved understanding of the underlying relationships between pedestrian crash\nrisk factors and specific lighting conditions.

The safety-critical nature of healthcare\nresults in a natural reticence to put these black-box deep learning models into\npractice. In this paper, we explore interpretable methods for a clinical\ndecision support system, sleep staging, based on physiological signals such as\nEEG, EOG, and EMG. A recent work has shown sleep staging using simple models\nand an exhaustive set of features can perform nearly as well as deep learning\napproaches but only for certain datasets. Moreover, the utility of these\nfeatures from a clinical standpoint is unclear. On the other hand, the proposed\nframework, NormIntSleep shows that by representing deep learning embeddings\nusing normalized features, great performance can be obtained across different\ndatasets. NormIntSleep performs 4.5% better than the exhaustive feature-based\napproach and 1.5% better than other representation learning approaches. An\nempirical comparison between the utility of the interpretations of these models\nhighlights the improved alignment with clinical expectations when performance\nis traded-off slightly.",

There\nare many peaks in the probability distribution predicted by the CTC models, and\neach peak represents a non-blank token.

Existing\nmethods to reduce latency require modifying the transition relationship between\ntokens in the forward-backward algorithm, and the gradient calculation. Some of\nthese methods even depend on the forced alignment results provided by other\npretrained models. The above methods are complex to implement. To reduce the\npeak latency, we propose a simple and novel method named peak-first\nregularization, which utilizes a frame-wise knowledge distillation function to\nforce the probability distribution of the CTC model to shift left along the\ntime axis instead of directly modifying the calculation process of CTC loss and\ngradients. All the experiments are conducted on a Chinese Mandarin dataset\nAISHELL-1.

    "abstract": "In this letter, we investigate error performance of rectangular pulse-shaped\northogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation with a practical receiver.\nSpecifically, we consider an essential bandpass filter at receiver RF\nfront-end, which has been ignored in existing works. We analyse the effect of\nrectangular pulses on practical OTFS receiver performance, and derive the exact\nforms of interference in delay-Doppler (DD) domain. We demonstrate that the\ntransmitted information symbols in certain regions of the DD domain are\nseverely contaminated. As a result, there is an error floor in the receiver\nerror performance, which needs to be addressed for such OTFS waveform in\npractical systems.",

    "abstract": "Cryo Focused Ion-Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (cryo FIB-SEM) enables\nthree-dimensional and nanoscale imaging of biological specimens via a slice and\nview mechanism. The FIB-SEM experiments are, however, limited by a slow\n(typically, several hours) acquisition process and the high electron doses\nimposed on the beam sensitive specimen can cause damage. In this work, we\npresent a compressive sensing variant of cryo FIB-SEM capable of reducing the\noperational electron dose and increasing speed. We propose two Targeted\nSampling (TS) strategies that leverage the reconstructed image of the previous\nsample layer as a prior for designing the next subsampling mask. Our image\nrecovery is based on a blind Bayesian dictionary learning approach, i.e., Beta\nProcess Factor Analysis (BPFA). This method is experimentally viable due to our\nultra-fast GPU-based implementation of BPFA. Simulations on artificial\ncompressive FIB-SEM measurements validate the success of proposed methods: the\noperational electron dose can be reduced by up to 20 times. These methods have\nlarge implications for the cryo FIB-SEM community, in which the imaging of beam\nsensitive biological materials without beam damage is crucial.",

While\nthis technology has the potential to scale, its success hinges on our ability\nto mitigate its risks. An important aspect of risk mitigation concerns\nassurances that the injected CO2 remains within the storage complex. Amongst\nthe different monitoring modalities, seismic imaging stands out with its\nability to attain high resolution and high fidelity images. However, these\nsuperior features come, unfortunately, at prohibitive costs and time-intensive\nefforts potentially rendering extensive seismic monitoring undesirable. To\novercome this shortcoming, we present a methodology where time-lapse images are\ncreated by inverting non-replicated time-lapse monitoring data jointly. By no\nlonger insisting on replication of the surveys to obtain high fidelity\ntime-lapse images and differences, extreme costs and time-consuming labor are\naverted. To demonstrate our approach, hundreds of noisy time-lapse seismic\ndatasets are simulated that contain imprints of regular CO2 plumes and\nirregular plumes that leak. These time-lapse datasets are subsequently inverted\nto produce time-lapse difference images used to train a deep neural classifier.\nThe testing results show that the classifier is capable of detecting CO2\nleakage automatically on unseen data and with a reasonable accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Latent variable models such as the Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) have become\na go-to tool for analyzing biological data, especially in the field of\nsingle-cell genomics. One remaining challenge is the interpretability of latent\nvariables as biological processes that define a cell's identity. Outside of\nbiological applications, this problem is commonly referred to as learning\ndisentangled representations. Although several disentanglement-promoting\nvariants of the VAE were introduced and applied to single-cell genomics data,\nthis task has been shown to be infeasible from independent and identically\ndistributed measurements, without additional structure. Instead, recent methods\npropose to leverage non-stationary data, as well as the sparse mechanism shift\nassumption in order to learn disentangled representations with a causal\nsemantic. Here, we extend the application of these methodological advances to\nthe analysis of single-cell genomics data with genetic or chemical\nperturbations. More precisely, we propose a deep generative model of\nsingle-cell gene expression data for which each perturbation is treated as a\nstochastic intervention targeting an unknown, but sparse, subset of latent\nvariables. We benchmark these methods on simulated single-cell data to evaluate\ntheir performance at latent units recovery, causal target identification and\nout-of-domain generalization. Finally, we apply those approaches to two\nreal-world large-scale gene perturbation data sets and find that models that\nexploit the sparse mechanism shift hypothesis surpass contemporary methods on a\ntransfer learning task.

The core\nidea of these models is to progressively transform the empirical data\ndistribution into a simple Gaussian distribution by adding noise using a\ndiffusion. We obtain new samples whose distribution is close to the data\ndistribution by simulating a \"denoising\" diffusion approximating the time\nreversal of this \"noising\" diffusion. This denoising diffusion relies on\napproximations of the logarithmic derivatives of the noised data densities,\nknown as scores, obtained using score matching. Such models can be easily\nextended to perform approximate posterior simulation in high-dimensional\nscenarios where one can only sample from the prior and simulate synthetic\nobservations from the likelihood. These methods have been primarily developed\nfor data on $\\mathbb{R}^d$ while extensions to more general spaces have been\ndeveloped on a case-by-case basis.

A general framework for integrated analysis\nof both Euclidean and non Euclidean data, composite AI, decision intelligence\nand edge AI provide powerful innovative ideas and strategies for fundamentally\nadvancing AI. We are expected to marry statistics with AI, develop a unified\ntheory of modern statistics and drive next generation of AI and data science.",

    "title": "Privacy Aware Experiments without Cookies",
    "abstract": "Consider two brands that want to jointly test alternate web experiences for\ntheir customers with an A/B test. Such collaborative tests are today enabled\nusing \\textit{third-party cookies}, where each brand has information on the\nidentity of visitors to another website. With the imminent elimination of\nthird-party cookies, such A/B tests will become untenable. We propose a\ntwo-stage experimental design, where the two brands only need to agree on\nhigh-level aggregate parameters of the experiment to test the alternate\nexperiences. Our design respects the privacy of customers. We propose an\nestimater of the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), show that it is unbiased and\ntheoretically compute its variance. Our demonstration describes how a marketer\nfor a brand can design such an experiment and analyze the results. On real and\nsimulated data, we show that the approach provides valid estimate of the ATE\nwith low variance and is robust to the proportion of visitors overlapping\nacross the brands.",

Working in both finite and\ninfinite horizons, we achieve strong convergence results by showing the\nboundedness of the pth moments of the adaptive EM solution. We also obtain the\norder of convergence infinite horizon. In addition, we show almost sure\nexponential stability of the adaptive approximate solution for both SDEs and\nSDDEs.",
