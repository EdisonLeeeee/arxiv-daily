FHE allows for the arbitrary depth\ncomputation of both addition and multiplication, and thus the application of\nabelian/polynomial equations, like those found in deep learning algorithms.\nThis project investigates, derives, and proves how FHE with deep learning can\nbe used at scale, with relatively low time complexity, the problems that such a\nsystem incurs, and mitigations/solutions for such problems. In addition, we\ndiscuss how this could have an impact on the future of data privacy and how it\ncan enable data sharing across various actors in the agri-food supply chain,\nhence allowing the development of machine learning-based systems. Finally, we\nfind that although FHE incurs a high spatial complexity cost, the time\ncomplexity is within expected reasonable bounds, while allowing for absolutely\nprivate predictions to be made, in our case for milk yield prediction.",

    "title": "A New Split for Evaluating True Zero-Shot Action Recognition",
    "abstract": "Zero-shot action recognition is the task of classifying action categories\nthat are not available in the training set. In this setting, the standard\nevaluation protocol is to use existing action recognition datasets (e.g.\nUCF101) and randomly split the classes into seen and unseen. However, most\nrecent work builds on representations pre-trained on the Kinetics dataset,\nwhere classes largely overlap with classes in the zero-shot evaluation\ndatasets. As a result, classes which are supposed to be unseen, are present\nduring supervised pre-training, invalidating the condition of the zero-shot\nsetting. A similar concern was previously noted several years ago for image\nbased zero-shot recognition, but has not been considered by the zero-shot\naction recognition community. In this paper, we propose a new split for true\nzero-shot action recognition with no overlap between unseen test classes and\ntraining or pre-training classes. We benchmark several recent approaches on the\nproposed True Zero-Shot (TruZe) Split for UCF101 and HMDB51, with zero-shot and\ngeneralized zero-shot evaluation. In our extensive analysis we find that our\nTruZe splits are significantly harder than comparable random splits as nothing\nis leaking from pre-training, i.e. unseen performance is consistently lower, up\nto 9.4% for zero-shot action recognition. In an additional evaluation we also\nfind that similar issues exist in the splits used in few-shot action\nrecognition, here we see differences of up to 14.1%. We publish our splits and\nhope that our benchmark analysis will change how the field is evaluating zero-\nand few-shot action recognition moving forward.",

    "abstract": "At the present time, sequential item recommendation models are compared by\ncalculating metrics on a small item subset (target set) to speed up\ncomputation. The target set contains the relevant item and a set of negative\nitems that are sampled from the full item set. Two well-known strategies to\nsample negative items are uniform random sampling and sampling by popularity to\nbetter approximate the item frequency distribution in the dataset. Most\nrecently published papers on sequential item recommendation rely on sampling by\npopularity to compare the evaluated models. However, recent work has already\nshown that an evaluation with uniform random sampling may not be consistent\nwith the full ranking, that is, the model ranking obtained by evaluating a\nmetric using the full item set as target set, which raises the question whether\nthe ranking obtained by sampling by popularity is equal to the full ranking. In\nthis work, we re-evaluate current state-of-the-art sequential recommender\nmodels from the point of view, whether these sampling strategies have an impact\non the final ranking of the models. We therefore train four recently proposed\nsequential recommendation models on five widely known datasets. For each\ndataset and model, we employ three evaluation strategies. First, we compute the\nfull model ranking. Then we evaluate all models on a target set sampled by the\ntwo different sampling strategies, uniform random sampling and sampling by\npopularity with the commonly used target set size of 100, compute the model\nranking for each strategy and compare them with each other. Additionally, we\nvary the size of the sampled target set. Overall, we find that both sampling\nstrategies can produce inconsistent rankings compared with the full ranking of\nthe models.

    "abstract": "The recent surge in federated data-management applications has brought forth\nconcerns about the security of underlying data and the consistency of replicas\nin the presence of malicious attacks. A prominent solution in this direction is\nto employ a permissioned blockchain framework that is modeled around\ntraditional Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols. Any federated\napplication expects its data to be globally scattered to achieve faster access.\nBut, prior works have shown that traditional BFT protocols are slow and this\nled to the rise of sharded-replicated blockchains. Existing BFT protocols for\nthese sharded blockchains are efficient if client transactions require access\nto a single-shard, but face performance degradation if there is a cross-shard\ntransaction that requires access to multiple shards. However, cross-shard\ntransactions are common, and to resolve this dilemma, we present RingBFT, a\nnovel meta-BFT protocol for sharded blockchains. RingBFT requires shards to\nadhere to the ring order, and follow the principle of process, forward, and\nre-transmit while ensuring the communication between shards is linear. Our\nevaluation of RingBFT against state-of-the-art sharding BFT protocols\nillustrates that RingBFT achieves up to 25x higher throughput, easily scales to\nnearly 500 globally distributed nodes, and achieves a peak throughput of 1.2\nmillion txns/s.",

During\nmanual harvesting of some fresh-market crops like strawberries and table\ngrapes, pickers spend significant amounts of time walking to carry full trays\nto a collection station at the edge of the field. A step toward increasing\nharvest automation for such crops is to deploy harvest-aid collaborative robots\n(co-bots) that transport the empty and full trays, thus increasing harvest\nefficiency by reducing pickers' non-productive walking times. This work\npresents the development of a co-robotic harvest-aid system and its evaluation\nduring commercial strawberry harvesting.

Our weights can be\ncustomized for different datasets and causal inference algorithms. We propose a\nnew theory for consistency of entropy balancing for continuous treatments.\nUsing synthetic and real-world data, we show that our proposed algorithm\noutperforms the entropy balancing in terms of causal inference accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Extensive research has documented the immediate impacts of the COVID-19\npandemic on scientists, yet it remains unclear if and how such impacts have\nshifted over time. Here we compare results from two surveys of principal\ninvestigators, conducted between April 2020 and January 2021, along with\nanalyses of large-scale publication data. We find that there has been a clear\nsign of recovery in some regards, as scientists' time spent on their work has\nalmost returned to pre-pandemic levels. However, the latest data also reveals a\nnew dimension in which the pandemic is affecting the scientific workforce: the\nrate of initiating new research projects. Except for the small fraction of\nscientists who directly engaged in COVID-related research, most scientists\nstarted significantly fewer new research projects in 2020. This decline is most\npronounced amongst the same demographic groups of scientists who reported the\nlargest initial disruptions: female scientists and those with young children.\nYet in sharp contrast to the earlier phase of the pandemic, when there were\nlarge disparities across scientific fields, this loss of new projects appears\nremarkably homogeneous across fields. Analyses of large-scale publication data\nreveal a global decline in the rate of new collaborations, especially in\nnon-COVID-related preprints, which is consistent with the reported decline in\nnew projects. Overall, these findings highlight that, while the end of the\npandemic may appear in sight in some countries, its large and unequal impact on\nthe scientific workforce may be enduring, which may have broad implications for\ninequality and the long-term vitality of science.",

In federated learning (FL), the global model payload that is\nmoved between the server and users depends on the number of items to recommend.\nThe model payload grows when there is an increasing number of items. This\nbecomes challenging for an FRS if it is running in production mode. To tackle\nthe payload challenge, we formulated a multi-arm bandit solution that selected\npart of the global model and transmitted it to all users. The selection process\nwas guided by a novel reward function suitable for FL systems. So far as we are\naware, this is the first optimization method that seeks to address item\ndependent payloads. The method was evaluated using three benchmark\nrecommendation datasets. The empirical validation confirmed that the proposed\nmethod outperforms the simpler methods that do not benefit from the bandits for\nthe purpose of item selection. In addition, we have demonstrated the usefulness\nof our proposed method by rigorously evaluating the effects of a payload\nreduction on the recommendation performance degradation.

In an attempt to expedite this process, an active area\nof research involves automating cell classification through use of deep\nlearning-based techniques. In practice, a large amount of data is required to\naccurately train these deep learning models. However, due to the sparse human\ncell datasets currently available, the performance of these models is typically\nlow. This study investigates the feasibility of using few-shot learning-based\ntechniques to mitigate the data requirements for accurate training. The study\nis comprised of three parts: First, current state-of-the-art few-shot learning\ntechniques are evaluated on human cell classification. The selected techniques\nare trained on a non-medical dataset and then tested on two out-of-domain,\nhuman cell datasets. The results indicate that, overall, the test accuracy of\nstate-of-the-art techniques decreased by at least 30% when transitioning from a\nnon-medical dataset to a medical dataset. Second, this study evaluates the\npotential benefits, if any, to varying the backbone architecture and training\nschemes in current state-of-the-art few-shot learning techniques when used in\nhuman cell classification. Even with these variations, the overall test\naccuracy decreased from 88.66% on non-medical datasets to 44.13% at best on the\nmedical datasets. Third, this study presents future directions for using\nfew-shot learning in human cell classification. In general, few-shot learning\nin its current state performs poorly on human cell classification. The study\nproves that attempts to modify existing network architectures are not effective\nand concludes that future research effort should be focused on improving\nrobustness towards out-of-domain testing using optimization-based or\nself-supervised few-shot learning techniques.",

We develop novel randomized techniques to\naccomplish the tensor compression, provide a detailed analysis of the\ncomputational costs, provide insight into the error of the resulting\napproximations, and discuss the benefits of the proposed approaches. We also\napply the tensor-based function approximation to develop low-rank matrix\napproximations to kernel matrices that describe pairwise interactions between\ntwo sets of points; the resulting low-rank approximations are efficient to\ncompute and store (the complexity is linear in the number of points). We have\ndetailed numerical experiments on example problems involving multivariate\nfunction approximation, low-rank matrix approximations of kernel matrices\ninvolving well-separated clusters of sources and target points, and a global\nlow-rank approximation of kernel matrices with an application to Gaussian\nprocesses.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a neural network built upon Transformers, namely PlaneTR,\nto simultaneously detect and reconstruct planes from a single image. Different\nfrom previous methods, PlaneTR jointly leverages the context information and\nthe geometric structures in a sequence-to-sequence way to holistically detect\nplane instances in one forward pass. Specifically, we represent the geometric\nstructures as line segments and conduct the network with three main components:\n(i) context and line segments encoders, (ii) a structure-guided plane decoder,\n(iii) a pixel-wise plane embedding decoder. Given an image and its detected\nline segments, PlaneTR generates the context and line segment sequences via two\nspecially designed encoders and then feeds them into a Transformers-based\ndecoder to directly predict a sequence of plane instances by simultaneously\nconsidering the context and global structure cues. Finally, the pixel-wise\nembeddings are computed to assign each pixel to one predicted plane instance\nwhich is nearest to it in embedding space. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate that PlaneTR achieves a state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet\nand NYUv2 datasets.",

    "abstract": "Image captioning is a task in the field of Artificial Intelligence that\nmerges between computer vision and natural language processing. It is\nresponsible for generating legends that describe images, and has various\napplications like descriptions used by assistive technology or indexing images\n(for search engines for instance). This makes it a crucial topic in AI that is\nundergoing a lot of research. This task however, like many others, is trained\non large images labeled via human annotation, which can be very cumbersome: it\nneeds manual effort, both financial and temporal costs, it is error-prone and\npotentially difficult to execute in some cases (e.g. medical images). To\nmitigate the need for labels, we attempt to use self-supervised learning, a\ntype of learning where models use the data contained within the images\nthemselves as labels. It is challenging to accomplish though, since the task is\ntwo-fold: the images and captions come from two different modalities and\nusually handled by different types of networks. It is thus not obvious what a\ncompletely self-supervised solution would look like. How it would achieve\ncaptioning in a comparable way to how self-supervision is applied today on\nimage recognition tasks is still an ongoing research topic. In this project, we\nare using an encoder-decoder architecture where the encoder is a convolutional\nneural network (CNN) trained on OpenImages dataset and learns image features in\na self-supervised fashion using the rotation pretext task. The decoder is a\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and it is trained, along within the image\ncaptioning model, on MS COCO dataset and is responsible of generating captions.\nOur GitHub repository can be found:\nhttps://github.com/elhagry1/SSL_ImageCaptioning_RotationPrediction",

The current research on the field is mostly focused on deep\nlearning-based methods, where attention mechanisms along with deep\nreinforcement and adversarial learning appear to be in the forefront of this\nresearch topic. In this paper, we review recent methodologies such as UpDown,\nOSCAR, VIVO, Meta Learning and a model that uses conditional generative\nadversarial nets.

    "abstract": "With the advent of off-the-shelf intelligent home products and broader\ninternet adoption, researchers increasingly explore smart computing\napplications that provide easier access to health and wellness resources.\nAI-based systems like chatbots have the potential to provide services that\ncould provide mental health support. However, existing therapy chatbots are\noften retrieval-based, requiring users to respond with a constrained set of\nanswers, which may not be appropriate given that such pre-determined inquiries\nmay not reflect each patient's unique circumstances. Generative-based\napproaches, such as the OpenAI GPT models, could allow for more dynamic\nconversations in therapy chatbot contexts than previous approaches. To\ninvestigate the generative-based model's potential in therapy chatbot contexts,\nwe built a chatbot using the GPT-2 model. We fine-tuned it with 306 therapy\nsession transcripts between family caregivers of individuals with dementia and\ntherapists conducting Problem Solving Therapy. We then evaluated the model's\npre-trained and the fine-tuned model in terms of basic qualities using three\nmeta-information measurements: the proportion of non-word outputs, the length\nof response, and sentiment components. Results showed that: (1) the fine-tuned\nmodel created more non-word outputs than the pre-trained model; (2) the\nfine-tuned model generated outputs whose length was more similar to that of the\ntherapists compared to the pre-trained model; (3) both the pre-trained model\nand fine-tuned model were likely to generate more negative and fewer positive\noutputs than the therapists. We discuss potential reasons for the problem, the\nimplications, and solutions for developing therapy chatbots and call for\ninvestigations of the AI-based system application.",

    "abstract": "This thesis presents methods and approaches to image color correction, color\nenhancement, and color editing. To begin, we study the color correction problem\nfrom the standpoint of the camera's image signal processor (ISP). A camera's\nISP is hardware that applies a series of in-camera image processing and color\nmanipulation steps, many of which are nonlinear in nature, to render the\ninitial sensor image to its final photo-finished representation saved in the\n8-bit standard RGB (sRGB) color space. As white balance (WB) is one of the\nmajor procedures applied by the ISP for color correction, this thesis presents\ntwo different methods for ISP white balancing. Afterward, we discuss another\nscenario of correcting and editing image colors, where we present a set of\nmethods to correct and edit WB settings for images that have been improperly\nwhite-balanced by the ISP. Then, we explore another factor that has a\nsignificant impact on the quality of camera-rendered colors, in which we\noutline two different methods to correct exposure errors in camera-rendered\nimages. Lastly, we discuss post-capture auto color editing and manipulation. In\nparticular, we propose auto image recoloring methods to generate different\nrealistic versions of the same camera-rendered image with new colors. Through\nextensive evaluations, we demonstrate that our methods provide superior\nsolutions compared to existing alternatives targeting color correction, color\nenhancement, and color editing.",

    "abstract": "Reconstruction-based methods play an important role in unsupervised anomaly\ndetection in images. Ideally, we expect a perfect reconstruction for normal\nsamples and poor reconstruction for abnormal samples. Since the\ngeneralizability of deep neural networks is difficult to control, existing\nmodels such as autoencoder do not work well. In this work, we interpret the\nreconstruction of an image as a divide-and-assemble procedure. Surprisingly, by\nvarying the granularity of division on feature maps, we are able to modulate\nthe reconstruction capability of the model for both normal and abnormal\nsamples. That is, finer granularity leads to better reconstruction, while\ncoarser granularity leads to poorer reconstruction. With proper granularity,\nthe gap between the reconstruction error of normal and abnormal samples can be\nmaximized. The divide-and-assemble framework is implemented by embedding a\nnovel multi-scale block-wise memory module into an autoencoder network.\nBesides, we introduce adversarial learning and explore the semantic latent\nrepresentation of the discriminator, which improves the detection of subtle\nanomaly. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the challenging MVTec AD\ndataset. Remarkably, we improve the vanilla autoencoder model by 10.1% in terms\nof the AUROC score.",

    "abstract": "Previous unsupervised monocular depth estimation methods mainly focus on the\nday-time scenario, and their frameworks are driven by warped photometric\nconsistency. While in some challenging environments, like night, rainy night or\nsnowy winter, the photometry of the same pixel on different frames is\ninconsistent because of the complex lighting and reflection, so that the\nday-time unsupervised frameworks cannot be directly applied to these complex\nscenarios. In this paper, we investigate the problem of unsupervised monocular\ndepth estimation in certain highly complex scenarios. We address this\nchallenging problem by using domain adaptation, and a unified image\ntransfer-based adaptation framework is proposed based on monocular videos in\nthis paper. The depth model trained on day-time scenarios is adapted to\ndifferent complex scenarios. Instead of adapting the whole depth network, we\njust consider the encoder network for lower computational complexity. The depth\nmodels adapted by the proposed framework to different scenarios share the same\ndecoder, which is practical. Constraints on both feature space and output space\npromote the framework to learn the key features for depth decoding, and the\nsmoothness loss is introduced into the adaptation framework for better depth\nestimation performance.

In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive\nattention-in-attention CycleGAN (AIA-CycleGAN) for non-parallel speech\nenhancement.

More\nspecifically, ATFA can capture the long-range temporal-spectral contextual\ninformation for more effective feature representations, while AHA can flexibly\naggregate different intermediate feature maps by weights depending on the\nglobal context. Numerous experimental results demonstrate that the proposed\napproach achieves consistently more superior performance over previous\nGAN-based and CycleGAN-based methods in non-parallel training.

    "abstract": "Neural Architecture Search (NAS) can automatically design well-performed\narchitectures of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for the tasks at hand. However,\none bottleneck of NAS is the prohibitively computational cost largely due to\nthe expensive performance evaluation. The neural predictors can directly\nestimate the performance without any training of the DNNs to be evaluated, thus\nhave drawn increasing attention from researchers. Despite their popularity,\nthey also suffer a severe limitation: the shortage of annotated DNN\narchitectures for effectively training the neural predictors. In this paper, we\nproposed Homogeneous Architecture Augmentation for Neural Predictor (HAAP) of\nDNN architectures to address the issue aforementioned. Specifically, a\nhomogeneous architecture augmentation algorithm is proposed in HAAP to generate\nsufficient training data taking the use of homogeneous representation.\nFurthermore, the one-hot encoding strategy is introduced into HAAP to make the\nrepresentation of DNN architectures more effective. The experiments have been\nconducted on both NAS-Benchmark-101 and NAS-Bench-201 dataset. The experimental\nresults demonstrate that the proposed HAAP algorithm outperforms the state of\nthe arts compared, yet with much less training data. In addition, the ablation\nstudies on both benchmark datasets have also shown the universality of the\nhomogeneous architecture augmentation.",

    "abstract": "Modelling long-range contextual relationships is critical for pixel-wise\nprediction tasks such as semantic segmentation. However, convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) are inherently limited to model such dependencies due to the\nnaive structure in its building modules (\\eg, local convolution kernel). While\nrecent global aggregation methods are beneficial for long-range structure\ninformation modelling, they would oversmooth and bring noise to the regions\ncontaining fine details (\\eg,~boundaries and small objects), which are very\nmuch cared for the semantic segmentation task. To alleviate this problem, we\npropose to explore the local context for making the aggregated long-range\nrelationship being distributed more accurately in local regions. In particular,\nwe design a novel local distribution module which models the affinity map\nbetween global and local relationship for each pixel adaptively. Integrating\nexisting global aggregation modules, we show that our approach can be\nmodularized as an end-to-end trainable block and easily plugged into existing\nsemantic segmentation networks, giving rise to the \\emph{GALD} networks.\nDespite its simplicity and versatility, our approach allows us to build new\nstate of the art on major semantic segmentation benchmarks including\nCityscapes, ADE20K, Pascal Context, Camvid and COCO-stuff.

    "abstract": "A common lens to theoretically study neural net architectures is to analyze\nthe functions they can approximate. However, the constructions from\napproximation theory often have unrealistic aspects, for example, reliance on\ninfinite precision to memorize target function values, which make these results\npotentially less meaningful. To address these issues, this work proposes a\nformal definition of statistically meaningful approximation which requires the\napproximating network to exhibit good statistical learnability. We present case\nstudies on statistically meaningful approximation for two classes of functions:\nboolean circuits and Turing machines. We show that overparameterized\nfeedforward neural nets can statistically meaningfully approximate boolean\ncircuits with sample complexity depending only polynomially on the circuit\nsize, not the size of the approximating network. In addition, we show that\ntransformers can statistically meaningfully approximate Turing machines with\ncomputation time bounded by $T$, requiring sample complexity polynomial in the\nalphabet size, state space size, and $\\log (T)$. Our analysis introduces new\ntools for generalization bounds that provide much tighter sample complexity\nguarantees than the typical VC-dimension or norm-based bounds, which may be of\nindependent interest.",

In particular, the behaviors of\nthe two THz hops are determined by three factors, which are the deterministic\npath loss, the fading effects, and pointing errors. Assuming that both THz\nlinks are subject to the $\\alpha$-$\\mu$ fading with pointing errors, we derive\nexact expressions for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and\nprobability density function (PDF) of the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR). Relying on the CDF and PDF, important performance metrics are evaluated,\nsuch as the outage probability, average bit error rate, and average channel\ncapacity. Moreover, the asymptotic analyses are presented to obtain more\ninsights. Results show that the dual-hop relaying scheme has better performance\nthan the single THz link. The system's diversity order is\n$\\min\\left\\{\\frac{\\phi_1}{2},\\frac{\\alpha_1\\mu_1}{2},\\phi_2,\\alpha_2\\mu_2\\right\\}$,\nwhere $\\alpha_i$ and $\\mu_i$ represent the fading parameters of the $i$-th THz\nlink for $i\\in(1,2)$, and $\\phi_i$ denotes the pointing error parameter.

We hope to segment\nthe 3D point cloud data of the terracotta warriors automatically and store the\nfragment data in the database to assist the archaeologists in matching the\nactual fragments with the ones in the database, which could result in higher\nrepairing efficiency of terracotta warriors. Moreover, the existing 3D neural\nnetwork research is mainly focusing on supervised classification, clustering,\nunsupervised representation, and reconstruction. There are few pieces of\nresearches concentrating on unsupervised point cloud part segmentation.

However, keypoint locations are often modeled only as\ncontinuous coordinates, so noise from semantically insignificant deviations in\nvideos easily disrupt learning stability, leading to inaccurate keypoint\nmodeling. In this paper, we design a new grid keypoint learning framework,\naiming at a robust and explainable intermediate keypoint representation for\nlong-term efficient video prediction. We have two major technical\ncontributions. First, we detect keypoints by jumping among candidate locations\nin our raised grid space and formulate a condensation loss to encourage\nmeaningful keypoints with strong representative capability. Second, we\nintroduce a 2D binary map to represent the detected grid keypoints and then\nsuggest propagating keypoint locations with stochasticity by selecting entries\nin the discrete grid space, thus preserving the spatial structure of keypoints\nin the longterm horizon for better future frame generation. Extensive\nexperiments verify that our method outperforms the state-ofthe-art stochastic\nvideo prediction methods while saves more than 98% of computing resources.

The vast majority\nof existing AUC-optimization-based machine learning methods only focus on\nbinary-class cases, while leaving the multiclass cases unconsidered. In this\npaper, we start an early trial to consider the problem of learning multiclass\nscoring functions via optimizing multiclass AUC metrics. Our foundation is\nbased on the M metric, which is a well-known multiclass extension of AUC. We\nfirst pay a revisit to this metric, showing that it could eliminate the\nimbalance issue from the minority class pairs. Motivated by this, we propose an\nempirical surrogate risk minimization framework to approximately optimize the M\nmetric. Theoretically, we show that: (i) optimizing most of the popular\ndifferentiable surrogate losses suffices to reach the Bayes optimal scoring\nfunction asymptotically; (ii) the training framework enjoys an imbalance-aware\ngeneralization error bound, which pays more attention to the bottleneck samples\nof minority classes compared with the traditional $O(\\sqrt{1/N})$ result.\nPractically, to deal with the low scalability of the computational operations,\nwe propose acceleration methods for three popular surrogate loss functions,\nincluding the exponential loss, squared loss, and hinge loss, to speed up loss\nand gradient evaluations.

In this context, multi-modal models\ncan help producing more accurate and robust predictions in machine learning\ntasks where audio-visual data is available. This paper presents a multi-modal\nmodel for automatic scene classification that exploits simultaneously auditory\nand visual information. The proposed approach makes use of two separate\nnetworks which are respectively trained in isolation on audio and visual data,\nso that each network specializes in a given modality. The visual subnetwork is\na pre-trained VGG16 model followed by a bidiretional recurrent layer, while the\nresidual audio subnetwork is based on stacked squeeze-excitation convolutional\nblocks trained from scratch. After training each subnetwork, the fusion of\ninformation from the audio and visual streams is performed at two different\nstages. The early fusion stage combines features resulting from the last\nconvolutional block of the respective subnetworks at different time steps to\nfeed a bidirectional recurrent structure. The late fusion stage combines the\noutput of the early fusion stage with the independent predictions provided by\nthe two subnetworks, resulting in the final prediction.

For baselines, we\nconsider both a generation-based approach using a language model and a\nretrieval-based approach by first retrieving the relevant steps from a large\ncandidate pool and then ordering them.

    "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)-synthesized table publishing lets\npeople privately learn insights without access to the private table. However,\nexisting studies on Membership Inference (MI) Attacks show promising results on\ndisclosing membership of training datasets of GAN-synthesized tables. Different\nfrom those works focusing on discovering membership of a given data point, in\nthis paper, we propose a novel Membership Collision Attack against GANs\n(TableGAN-MCA), which allows an adversary given only synthetic entries randomly\nsampled from a black-box generator to recover partial GAN training data.\nNamely, a GAN-synthesized table immune to state-of-the-art MI attacks is\nvulnerable to the TableGAN-MCA. The success of TableGAN-MCA is boosted by an\nobservation that GAN-synthesized tables potentially collide with the training\ndata of the generator.\nOur experimental evaluations on TableGAN-MCA have five main findings. First,\nTableGAN-MCA has a satisfying training data recovery rate on three commonly\nused real-world datasets against four generative models. Second, factors,\nincluding the size of GAN training data, GAN training epochs and the number of\nsynthetic samples available to the adversary, are positively correlated to the\nsuccess of TableGAN-MCA. Third, highly frequent data points have high risks of\nbeing recovered by TableGAN-MCA. Fourth, some unique data are exposed to\nunexpected high recovery risks in TableGAN-MCA, which may attribute to GAN's\ngeneralization. Fifth, as expected, differential privacy, without the\nconsideration of the correlations between features, does not show commendable\nmitigation effect against the TableGAN-MCA. Finally, we propose two mitigation\nmethods and show promising privacy and utility trade-offs when protecting\nagainst TableGAN-MCA.",

    "abstract": "In the desire to quantify the success of neural networks in deep learning and\nother applications, there is a great interest in understanding which functions\nare efficiently approximated by the outputs of neural networks. By now, there\nexists a variety of results which show that a wide range of functions can be\napproximated with sometimes surprising accuracy by these outputs. For example,\nit is known that the set of functions that can be approximated with exponential\naccuracy (in terms of the number of parameters used) includes, on one hand,\nvery smooth functions such as polynomials and analytic functions (see e.g.\n\\cite{E,S,Y}) and, on the other hand, very rough functions such as the\nWeierstrass function (see e.g. \\cite{EPGB,DDFHP}), which is nowhere\ndifferentiable. In this paper, we add to the latter class of rough functions by\nshowing that it also includes refinable functions. Namely, we show that\nrefinable functions are approximated by the outputs of deep ReLU networks with\na fixed width and increasing depth with accuracy exponential in terms of their\nnumber of parameters. Our results apply to functions used in the standard\nconstruction of wavelets as well as to functions constructed via subdivision\nalgorithms in Computer Aided Geometric Design.",

    "abstract": "Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) monitors heart rate without requiring\nphysical contact, which allows for a wide variety of applications. Deep\nlearning-based rPPG have demonstrated superior performance over the traditional\napproaches in controlled context. However, the lighting situation in indoor\nspace is typically complex, with uneven light distribution and frequent\nvariations in illumination. It lacks a fair comparison of different methods\nunder different illuminations using the same dataset. In this paper, we present\na public dataset, namely the BH-rPPG dataset, which contains data from twelve\nsubjects under three illuminations: low, medium, and high illumination. We also\nprovide the ground truth heart rate measured by an oximeter. We evaluate the\nperformance of three deep learning-based methods to that of four traditional\nmethods using two public datasets: the UBFC-rPPG dataset and the BH-rPPG\ndataset. The experimental results demonstrate that traditional methods are\ngenerally more resistant to fluctuating illuminations. We found that the\nrPPGNet achieves lowest MAE among deep learning-based method under medium\nillumination, whereas the CHROM achieves 1.5 beats per minute (BPM),\noutperforming the rPPGNet by 60%. These findings suggest that while developing\ndeep learning-based heart rate estimation algorithms, illumination variation\nshould be taken into account. This work serves as a benchmark for rPPG\nperformance evaluation and it opens a pathway for future investigation into\ndeep learning-based rPPG under illumination variations.",

A recent line of research has resulted in $\\tilde{O}(t)$-time algorithms,\nwhich are (near-)optimal under popular complexity-theoretic assumptions. On the\nother hand, the standard dynamic programming algorithm runs in time $O(n \\cdot\n|\\mathcal{S}(X,t)|)$, where $\\mathcal{S}(X,t)$ is the set of all subset sums of\n$X$ that are smaller than $t$. Furthermore, all known pseudopolynomial\nalgorithms actually solve a stronger task, since they actually compute the\nwhole set $\\mathcal{S}(X,t)$.\nAs the aforementioned two running times are incomparable, in this paper we\nask whether one can achieve the best of both worlds: running time\n$\\tilde{O}(|\\mathcal{S}(X,t)|)$. In particular, we ask whether\n$\\mathcal{S}(X,t)$ can be computed in near-linear time in the output-size.\nUsing a diverse toolkit containing techniques such as color coding, sparse\nrecovery, and sumset estimates, we make considerable progress towards this\nquestion and design an algorithm running in time\n$\\tilde{O}(|\\mathcal{S}(X,t)|^{4/3})$.\nCentral to our approach is the study of top-$k$-convolution, a natural\nproblem of independent interest: given sparse polynomials with non-negative\ncoefficients, compute the lowest $k$ non-zero monomials of their product.

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen a surge in research on deep interpretable neural\nnetworks with decision trees as one of the most commonly incorporated tools.\nThere are at least three advantages of using decision trees over logistic\nregression classification models: they are easy to interpret since they are\nbased on binary decisions, they can make decisions faster, and they provide a\nhierarchy of classes. However, one of the well-known drawbacks of decision\ntrees, as compared to decision graphs, is that decision trees cannot reuse the\ndecision nodes. Nevertheless, decision graphs were not commonly used in deep\nlearning due to the lack of efficient gradient-based training techniques. In\nthis paper, we fill this gap and provide a general paradigm based on Markov\nprocesses, which allows for efficient training of the special type of decision\ngraphs, which we call Self-Organizing Neural Graphs (SONG). We provide an\nextensive theoretical study of SONG, complemented by experiments conducted on\nLetter, Connect4, MNIST, CIFAR, and TinyImageNet datasets, showing that our\nmethod performs on par or better than existing decision models.",

Based\non above understandings, we first discuss several issues regarding current\nthird-order WENO-Z improvements (e.g. WENO-NP3, -F3, -NN3, -PZ3 and -P+3), i.e.\nthe numerical results with scale dependency, the validity of analysis assuming\ncritical points occurring on nodes, and the sensitivity regarding computational\ntime step and initial condition in order convergence studies. By analyses and\nnumerical validations, the defections of present improvements are demonstrated,\neither scale-dependency of results or failure to recover optimal order when\ncritical points occurring at half nodes, then a generic analysis is provided\nwhich considers the first-order critical point occurring within grid intervals.\nBased on achieved theoretical outcomes, two scale-independent, third-order\nWENO-Z schemes are proposed which could truly recover the optimal order at\ncritical points: the first one is acquired by limited expansion of grid\nstencil, deriving new global smoothness indicator and incorporating with the\nmapping function; the second one is achieved by further expanding grid stencil\nand employing a different global smoothness indicator. For validating, typical\n1-D scalar advection problems, 1-D and 2-D problems by Euler equations are\nchosen and tested.

Yet, to\ndate, no research has tested the validity of social media emotion macroscopes\nto track the temporal evolution of emotions at the level of a whole society.\nHere we present a pre-registered prediction study that shows how\ngender-rescaled time series of Twitter emotional expression at the national\nlevel substantially correlate with aggregates of self-reported emotions in a\nweekly representative survey in the United Kingdom. A follow-up exploratory\nanalysis shows a high prevalence of third-person references in\nemotionally-charged tweets, indicating that social media data provide a way of\nsocial sensing the emotions of others rather than just the emotional\nexperiences of users. These results show that, despite the issues that social\nmedia have in terms of representativeness and algorithmic confounding, the\ncombination of advanced text analysis methods with user demographic information\nin social media emotion macroscopes can provide measures that are informative\nof the general population beyond social media users.",

The study traces the growth of\npublications, prominent keywords, leading journals where the articles are\npublished and the institutional collaboration patterns of Indian university\npublications. The results show that there is a growth in scholarly publications\nfrom Indian universities in LIS. However, the numbers of publications are\nlimited to only a few universities and national institutes of importance. The\nmaximum LIS research outputs are published in Indian journals.

Accurate diagnosis of the disease at\nearly stage is critical for precision disease control and management.

Recent advances in\nimaging sensors (e.g. RGB, multiple spectral and hyperspectral cameras), remote\nsensing and machine learning offer the opportunity to address this challenge.\nParticularly, hyperspectral imagery (HSI) combining with machine learning/deep\nlearning approaches is preferable for accurately identifying specific plant\ndiseases because the HSI consists of a wide range of high-quality reflectance\ninformation beyond human vision, capable of capturing both spectral-spatial\ninformation.

To further optimize the network structure and improve\nthe efficiency of the network. we search for the network structure of the\nfeature fusion module using NAS techniques. Finally, be aware of that\ngenerating pseudo-LiDAR from RGB via depth estimation introduces extra\ncomputational costs and relies on depth estimation networks, we design a\nmodality distillation strategy and leverage it to further free our network from\nthese extra computational cost and dependencies during inference. The proposed\nmethod achieves state-of-the-art performance on two challenging benchmarks,\nKITTI and R2D.",

    "abstract": "We address brittle fracture in anisotropic materials featuring two-fold and\nfour-fold symmetric fracture toughness. For these two classes, we develop two\nvariational phase-field models based on the family of regularizations proposed\nby Focardi (Focardi, M. On the variational approximation of free-discontinuity\nproblems in the vectorial case. Math. Models Methods App. Sci., 11:663{684,\n2001), for which Gamma-convergence results hold. Since both models are of\nsecond order, as opposed to the previously available fourth-order models for\nfour-fold symmetric fracture toughness, they do not require basis functions of\nC1-continuity nor mixed variational principles for finite element\ndiscretization. For the four-fold symmetric formulation we show that the\nstandard quadratic degradation function is unsuitable and devise a procedure to\nderive a suitable one. The performance of the new models is assessed via\nseveral numerical examples that simulate anisotropic fracture under anti-plane\nshear loading. For both formulations at fixed displacements (i.e. within an\nalternate minimization procedure), we also provide some existence and\nuniqueness results for the phase-field solution.",

    "abstract": "Towards predicting patch correctness in APR, we propose a simple, but novel\nhypothesis on how the link between the patch behaviour and failing test\nspecifications can be drawn: similar failing test cases should require similar\npatches. We then propose BATS, an unsupervised learning-based system to predict\npatch correctness by checking patch Behaviour Against failing Test\nSpecification. BATS exploits deep representation learning models for code and\npatches: for a given failing test case, the yielded embedding is used to\ncompute similarity metrics in the search for historical similar test cases in\norder to identify the associated applied patches, which are then used as a\nproxy for assessing generated patch correctness. Experimentally, we first\nvalidate our hypothesis by assessing whether ground-truth developer patches\ncluster together in the same way that their associated failing test cases are\nclustered. Then, after collecting a large dataset of 1278 plausible patches\n(written by developers or generated by some 32 APR tools), we use BATS to\npredict correctness: BATS achieves an AUC between 0.557 to 0.718 and a recall\nbetween 0.562 and 0.854 in identifying correct patches. Compared against\nprevious work, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art\nperformance in patch correctness prediction, without the need for large labeled\npatch datasets in contrast with prior machine learning-based approaches. While\nBATS is constrained by the availability of similar test cases, we show that it\ncan still be complementary to existing approaches: used in conjunction with a\nrecent approach implementing supervised learning, BATS improves the overall\nrecall in detecting correct patches.

To any given instance $I$ of the GNEP, we derive a convexified\ninstance $I^\\text{conv}$ and show that every feasible strategy profile for $I$\nis an equilibrium if and only if it is an equilibrium for $I^\\text{conv}$ and\nthe convexified cost functions coincide with the initial ones.

The main idea is the reformulation of the 2-D problem\naccording to addition theorem for Hankel functions that appear in Green\nfunction of 2-D homogeneous media. In this regard, recursive formulas in\nspatial frequency domain are derived and the scattering field is rewritten into\ninward and outward components and, then, the primary 2-D problem can be solved\nusing 1D FFT in the stabilized biconjugate-gradient fast Fourier transform\nBCGS-FFT algorithm. Because the emerging method obtains 1D FFT over a circle,\nthere is no need to expand an object region by zero padding, whereas it is\nnecessary for conventional 2D FFT approach. Therefore, the method saves lots of\nmemory and time over the conventional approach. other interesting aspect of the\nproposed method is that the field on a circle outside a scattering object, can\nbe calculated efficiently using an analytical formula. This is, particularly,\nattractive in electromagnetic inverse scattering problems and microwave\nimaging. The numerical examples for 2-D TM problems demonstrate merits of\nproposed technique in terms of the accuracy and computational efficiency.",

(In\nfact, existing solutions also incur an extra factor of $1+\\epsilon$ in the\nstretch for weighted graphs, and an additional factor of $\\log^{O(1)}n$ in the\nspace.) The only existing solution of the second type uses $n^{1/2 -\nO(1/\\kappa)}$ passes over the stream (for space $O(n^{1+1/\\kappa})$), and\napplies only to unweighted graphs.\nIn this paper we show that $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximate single-source shortest\npaths can be computed in this setting with $\\tilde{O}(n^{1+1/\\kappa})$ space\nusing just \\emph{constantly} many passes in unweighted graphs, and\npolylogarithmically many passes in weighted graphs (assuming $\\epsilon$ and\n$\\kappa$ are constant).

However, directly using implicit\nfeedback can lead to learning wrong relevance models and is known as biased\nLTR. The mismatch between implicit feedback and true relevances is due to\nvarious nuisances, with position bias one of the most relevant. Position bias\nmodels consider that the lack of interaction with a presented item is not only\nattributed to the item being irrelevant but because the item was not examined.\nThis paper introduces a method for modeling the probability of an item being\nseen in different contexts, e.g., for different users, with a single estimator.\nOur suggested method, denoted as contextual (EM)-based regression, is\nranker-agnostic and able to correctly learn the latent examination\nprobabilities while only using implicit feedback. Our empirical results\nindicate that the method introduced in this paper outperforms other existing\nposition bias estimators in terms of relative error when the examination\nprobability varies across queries. Moreover, the estimated values provide a\nranking performance boost when used to debias the implicit ranking data even if\nthere is no context dependency on the examination probabilities.",

    "abstract": "Though widely used in image classification, convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) are prone to noise interruptions, i.e. the CNN output can be drastically\nchanged by small image noise. To improve the noise robustness, we try to\nintegrate CNNs with wavelet by replacing the common down-sampling (max-pooling,\nstrided-convolution, and average pooling) with discrete wavelet transform\n(DWT). We firstly propose general DWT and inverse DWT (IDWT) layers applicable\nto various orthogonal and biorthogonal discrete wavelets like Haar, Daubechies,\nand Cohen, etc., and then design wavelet integrated CNNs (WaveCNets) by\nintegrating DWT into the commonly used CNNs (VGG, ResNets, and DenseNet).\nDuring the down-sampling, WaveCNets apply DWT to decompose the feature maps\ninto the low-frequency and high-frequency components. Containing the main\ninformation including the basic object structures, the low-frequency component\nis transmitted into the following layers to generate robust high-level\nfeatures. The high-frequency components are dropped to remove most of the data\nnoises. The experimental results show that %wavelet accelerates the CNN\ntraining, and WaveCNets achieve higher accuracy on ImageNet than various\nvanilla CNNs. We have also tested the performance of WaveCNets on the noisy\nversion of ImageNet, ImageNet-C and six adversarial attacks, the results\nsuggest that the proposed DWT/IDWT layers could provide better noise-robustness\nand adversarial robustness. When applying WaveCNets as backbones, the\nperformance of object detectors (i.e., faster R-CNN and RetinaNet) on COCO\ndetection dataset are consistently improved. We believe that suppression of\naliasing effect, i.e. separation of low frequency and high frequency\ninformation, is the main advantages of our approach. The code of our DWT/IDWT\nlayer and different WaveCNets are available at\nhttps://github.com/CVI-SZU/WaveCNet.",

In the process, anomaly detection for wireless sensor data\nplays an important role. However, traditional anomaly detection algorithms\noriginally designed for anomaly detection in static data have not properly\nconsidered the inherent characteristics of data stream produced by wireless\nsensor such as infiniteness, correlations and concept drift, which may pose a\nconsiderable challenge on anomaly detection based on data stream, and lead to\nlow detection accuracy and efficiency. First, data stream usually generates\nquickly which means that it is infinite and enormous, so any traditional\noff-line anomaly detection algorithm that attempts to store the whole dataset\nor to scan the dataset multiple times for anomaly detection will run out of\nmemory space. Second, there exist correlations among different data streams,\nwhich traditional algorithms hardly consider. Third, the underlying data\ngeneration process or data distribution may change over time. Thus, traditional\nanomaly detection algorithms with no model update will lose their effects.\nConsidering these issues, a novel method (called DLSHiForest) on basis of\nLocality-Sensitive Hashing and time window technique in this paper is proposed\nto solve these problems while achieving accurate and efficient detection.\nComprehensive experiments are executed using real-world agricultural greenhouse\ndataset to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.

While\nmany deep reinforcement learning methods have aimed at improving sample\nefficiency through replay or improved exploration techniques, state of the art\nactor-critic and policy gradient methods still suffer from the hard exploration\nproblem in sparse reward settings. Motivated by recent successes of value-based\nmethods for approximating state-action values, like RBF-DQN, we explore the\npotential of value-based reinforcement learning for learning continuous robotic\nmanipulation tasks in multi-task sparse reward settings. On robotic\nmanipulation tasks, we empirically show RBF-DQN converges faster than current\nstate of the art algorithms such as TD3, SAC, and PPO. We also perform ablation\nstudies with RBF-DQN and have shown that some enhancement techniques for\nvanilla Deep Q learning such as Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) and\nPrioritized Experience Replay (PER) can also be applied to RBF-DQN.

    "abstract": "The main innovation of the Fifth Generation (5G) of mobile networks is the\nability to provide novel services with new and stricter requirements. One of\nthe technologies that enable the new 5G services is the Multi-access Edge\nComputing (MEC). MEC is a system composed of multiple devices with computing\nand storage capabilities that are deployed at the edge of the network, i.e.,\nclose to the end users. MEC reduces latency and enables contextual information\nand real-time awareness of the local environment. MEC also allows cloud\noffloading and the reduction of traffic congestion. Performance is not the only\nrequirement that the new 5G services have. New mission-critical applications\nalso require high security and dependability. These three aspects (security,\ndependability, and performance) are rarely addressed together. This survey\nfills this gap and presents 5G MEC by addressing all these three aspects.\nFirst, we overview the background knowledge on MEC by referring to the current\nstandardization efforts. Second, we individually present each aspect by\nintroducing the related taxonomy (important for the not expert on the aspect),\nthe state of the art, and the challenges on 5G MEC. Finally, we discuss the\nchallenges of jointly addressing the three aspects.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge built culturally across generations allows humans to learn far more\nthan an individual could glean from their own experience in a lifetime.\nCultural knowledge in turn rests on language: language is the richest record of\nwhat previous generations believed, valued, and practiced. The power and\nmechanisms of language as a means of cultural learning, however, are not well\nunderstood. We take a first step towards reverse-engineering cultural learning\nthrough language. We developed a suite of complex high-stakes tasks in the form\nof minimalist-style video games, which we deployed in an iterated learning\nparadigm. Game participants were limited to only two attempts (two lives) to\nbeat each game and were allowed to write a message to a future participant who\nread the message before playing. Knowledge accumulated gradually across\ngenerations, allowing later generations to advance further in the games and\nperform more efficient actions. Multigenerational learning followed a\nstrikingly similar trajectory to individuals learning alone with an unlimited\nnumber of lives. These results suggest that language provides a sufficient\nmedium to express and accumulate the knowledge people acquire in these diverse\ntasks: the dynamics of the environment, valuable goals, dangerous risks, and\nstrategies for success. The video game paradigm we pioneer here is thus a rich\ntest bed for theories of cultural transmission and learning from language.",

    "abstract": "The pixelwise reconstruction error of deep autoencoders is often utilized for\nimage novelty detection and localization under the assumption that pixels with\nhigh error indicate which parts of the input image are unfamiliar and therefore\nlikely to be novel. This assumed correlation between pixels with high\nreconstruction error and novel regions of input images has not been verified\nand may limit the accuracy of these methods. In this paper we utilize saliency\nmaps to evaluate whether this correlation exists. Saliency maps reveal directly\nhow much a change in each input pixel would affect reconstruction loss, while\neach pixel's reconstruction error may be attributed to many input pixels when\nlayers are fully connected. We compare saliency maps to reconstruction error\nmaps via qualitative visualizations as well as quantitative correspondence\nbetween the top K elements of the maps for both novel and normal images.

Further, our design\nimproves performance by effectively mapping the sparse data to the hardware\nunits by utilizing sparsity in both input feature maps and weights.

To capture the semantics of binary code, we introduce DEXTER,\na novel function embedding that combines static analysis-based features with\nlocal context from the call graph and global context from the entire binary. We\ndemonstrate that XFL outperforms state-of-the-art approaches to function\nlabeling on a dataset of over 10,000 binaries from the Debian project,\nachieving a precision of 82.5%.

Moreover, pathogens can also be transferred from one\nsurface to another by contaminated hands, which facilitates transmission by\nindirect contact. Consequently, hands hygiene is extremely important to prevent\nthe spread of the SARSCoV-2 virus.

    "abstract": "Prediction and control of rumor diffusion in social networks (SNs) are\nclosely tied to the underlying connectivity patterns. Contrary to most existing\nefforts that exclusively focus on positive social user interactions, the impact\nof contagion processes on the temporal evolution of signed SNs with distinctive\nfriendly (positive) and hostile (negative) relationships yet, remains largely\nunexplored. In this paper, we study the interplay between social link polarity\nand propagation of intentionally fabricated information coupled with user\nalertness. In particular, we propose a novel energy model built on Heider's\nbalance theory that relates the stochastic\nsusceptible-alert-infected-susceptible rumor epidemic model with the structural\nbalance of signed SNs to substantiate the trade-off between social tension and\nrumor spread. Moreover, the role of hostile social links in the formation of\ndisjoint friendly clusters of alerted and infected users is analyzed. Using\nthree real-world datasets, we further present a time-efficient algorithm to\nexpedite the energy computation in our Monte-Carlo simulation method and show\ncompelling insights on the effectiveness and rationality of user awareness and\ninitial network settings in reaching structurally balanced local and global\nnetwork energy states.",

Therefore, point cloud neural networks have become a popular\nresearch direction in recent years.

Moreover, we\npropose a quantitative validation method for explainability methods of point\nclouds which enhances the persuasive power of explainability by dropping the\nmost positive or negative contributing features and monitoring how the\nclassification scores of specific categories change. To enable an intuitive\nexplanation of misclassified instances, we display features with confounding\ncontributions.

    "abstract": "We present the Regensburg Breast Shape Model (RBSM) - a 3D statistical shape\nmodel of the female breast built from 110 breast scans, and the first ever\npublicly available. Together with the model, a fully automated, pairwise\nsurface registration pipeline used to establish correspondence among 3D breast\nscans is introduced. Our method is computationally efficient and requires only\nfour landmarks to guide the registration process. In order to weaken the strong\ncoupling between breast and thorax, we propose to minimize the variance outside\nthe breast region as much as possible. To achieve this goal, a novel concept\ncalled breast probability masks (BPMs) is introduced. A BPM assigns\nprobabilities to each point of a 3D breast scan, telling how likely it is that\na particular point belongs to the breast area. During registration, we use BPMs\nto align the template to the target as accurately as possible inside the breast\nregion and only roughly outside. This simple yet effective strategy\nsignificantly reduces the unwanted variance outside the breast region, leading\nto better statistical shape models in which breast shapes are quite well\ndecoupled from the thorax. The RBSM is thus able to produce a variety of\ndifferent breast shapes as independently as possible from the shape of the\nthorax. Our systematic experimental evaluation reveals a generalization ability\nof 0.17 mm and a specificity of 2.8 mm for the RBSM. Ultimately, our model is\nseen as a first step towards combining physically motivated deformable models\nof the breast and statistical approaches in order to enable more realistic\nsurgical outcome simulation.",

    "abstract": "Automatic segmentation of anatomical structures is critical for many medical\napplications. However, the results are not always clinically acceptable and\nrequire tedious manual revision. Here, we present a novel concept called\nartificial intelligence assisted contour revision (AIACR) and demonstrate its\nfeasibility. The proposed clinical workflow of AIACR is as follows given an\ninitial contour that requires a clinicians revision, the clinician indicates\nwhere a large revision is needed, and a trained deep learning (DL) model takes\nthis input to update the contour. This process repeats until a clinically\nacceptable contour is achieved. The DL model is designed to minimize the\nclinicians input at each iteration and to minimize the number of iterations\nneeded to reach acceptance. In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrated the\nconcept on 2D axial images of three head-and-neck cancer datasets, with the\nclinicians input at each iteration being one mouse click on the desired\nlocation of the contour segment. The performance of the model is quantified\nwith Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and 95th percentile of Hausdorff\nDistance (HD95). The average DSC/HD95 (mm) of the auto-generated initial\ncontours were 0.82/4.3, 0.73/5.6 and 0.67/11.4 for three datasets, which were\nimproved to 0.91/2.1, 0.86/2.4 and 0.86/4.7 with three mouse clicks,\nrespectively. Each DL-based contour update requires around 20 ms. We proposed a\nnovel AIACR concept that uses DL models to assist clinicians in revising\ncontours in an efficient and effective way, and we demonstrated its feasibility\nby using 2D axial CT images from three head-and-neck cancer datasets.",

However, in many tasks (e.g.,\nmedical diagnosis), the labels are discrete and successively distributed. The\nUDA for ordinal classification requires inducing non-trivial ordinal\ndistribution prior to the latent space. Target for this, the partially ordered\nset (poset) is defined for constraining the latent vector. Instead of the\ntypically i.i.d.

Furthermore, we are able to control the\ndensity of content vectors that violate the poset constraint by a simple\n\"three-sigma rule\". We explicitly disentangle the cross-domain images into a\nshared ordinal prior induced ordinal content space and two separate\nsource/target ordinal-unrelated spaces, and the self-training is worked on the\nshared space exclusively for ordinal-aware domain alignment.

This is, in part, because ANNs have demonstrated\ngood results in a wide variety of recommendation tasks. The introduction of\nANNs within the recommendation ecosystem has been recently questioned, raising\nseveral comparisons in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. One aspect most\nof these comparisons have in common is their focus on accuracy, neglecting\nother evaluation dimensions important for the recommendation, such as novelty,\ndiversity, or accounting for biases. We replicate experiments from three papers\nthat compare Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) and Matrix Factorization\n(MF), to extend the analysis to other evaluation dimensions. Our contribution\nshows that the experiments are entirely reproducible, and we extend the study\nincluding other accuracy metrics and two statistical hypothesis tests. We\ninvestigated the Diversity and Novelty of the recommendations, showing that MF\nprovides a better accuracy also on the long tail, although NCF provides a\nbetter item coverage and more diversified recommendations. We discuss the bias\neffect generated by the tested methods. They show a relatively small bias, but\nother recommendation baselines, with competitive accuracy performance,\nconsistently show to be less affected by this issue. This is the first work, to\nthe best of our knowledge, where several evaluation dimensions have been\nexplored for an array of SOTA algorithms covering recent adaptations of ANNs\nand MF.

    "abstract": "Quantization is a technique for reducing deep neural networks (DNNs) training\nand inference times, which is crucial for training in resource constrained\nenvironments or time critical inference applications. State-of-the-art (SOTA)\nquantization approaches focus on post-training quantization, i.e. quantization\nof pre-trained DNNs for speeding up inference. Very little work on quantized\ntraining exists, which neither al-lows dynamic intra-epoch precision switches\nnor em-ploys an information theory based switching heuristic. Usually, existing\napproaches require full precision refinement afterwards and enforce a global\nword length across the whole DNN. This leads to suboptimal quantization\nmappings and resource usage. Recognizing these limits, we introduce MARViN, a\nnew quantized training strategy using information theory-based intra-epoch\nprecision switching, which decides on a per-layer basis which precision should\nbe used in order to minimize quantization-induced information loss. Note that\nany quantization must leave enough precision such that future learning steps do\nnot suffer from vanishing gradients. We achieve an average speedup of 1.86\ncompared to a float32 basis while limiting mean accuracy degradation on\nAlexNet/ResNet to only -0.075%.",

    "abstract": "Neural network test cases are meant to exercise different reasoning paths in\nan architecture and used to validate the prediction outcomes. In this paper, we\nintroduce \"computational profiles\" as vectors of neuron activation levels. We\ninvestigate the distribution of computational profile likelihood of metamorphic\ntest cases with respect to the likelihood distributions of training, test and\nerror control cases. We estimate the non-parametric probability densities of\nneuron activation levels for each distinct output class. Probabilities are\ninferred using training cases only, without any additional knowledge about\nmetamorphic test cases. Experiments are performed by training a network on the\nMNIST Fashion library of images and comparing prediction likelihoods with those\nobtained from error control-data and from metamorphic test cases. Experimental\nresults show that the distributions of computational profile likelihood for\ntraining and test cases are somehow similar, while the distribution of the\nrandom-noise control-data is always remarkably lower than the observed one for\nthe training and testing sets. In contrast, metamorphic test cases show a\nprediction likelihood that lies in an extended range with respect to training,\ntests, and random noise. Moreover, the presented approach allows the\nindependent assessment of different training classes and experiments to show\nthat some of the classes are more sensitive to misclassifying metamorphic test\ncases than other classes. In conclusion, metamorphic test cases represent very\naggressive tests for neural network architectures. Furthermore, since\nmetamorphic test cases force a network to misclassify those inputs whose\nlikelihood is similar to that of training cases, they could also be considered\nas adversarial attacks that evade defenses based on computational profile\nlikelihood evaluation.",

We characterize the number of possible structures\nand obtain a universal upper bound on the structural entropy of $2n -\n\\frac{3}{2} \\log_2 n - \\frac{1}{2} \\log_2 \\pi$, which holds for any $n$, $r$\nand distribution of the node locations. For large $n$, we derive bounds on the\nstructural entropy normalized by $n$, for independent and uniformly distributed\nnode locations. When the connection range $r_n$ is $O(1/n)$, the obtained upper\nbound is given in terms of a function that increases with $n r_n$ and\nasymptotically attains $2$ bits per node. If the connection range is bounded\naway from zero and one, the upper bound decreases with $r$ as $2(1-r)$. When\n$r_n$ is vanishing but dominates $1/n$ (e.g., $r_n \\propto \\ln n / n$), the\nnormalized entropy is between $\\log_2 e \\approx 1.44$ and $2$ bits per node.

So far, many inference\nalgorithms have been proposed to classify the AS relationships, which mainly\nfocus on Peer-Peer (P2P) and Provider-Customer (P2C) binary classification and\nachieved excellent results. However, there are other types of AS relationships\nin actual scenarios, i.e., the businessbased sibling and structure-based\nexchange relationships, that were neglected in the previous research. These\nrelationships are usually difficult to be inferred by existing algorithms\nbecause there is no discrimination on the designed features compared to the P2P\nor P2C relationships.\nIn this paper, we focus on the multi-classification of AS relationships for\nthe first time. We first summarize the differences between AS relationships\nunder the structural and attribute features, and the reasons why multiple\nrelationships are difficult to be inferred. We then introduce new features and\npropose a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) framework, AS-GCN, to solve this\nmulti-classification problem under complex scene. The framework takes into\naccount the global network structure and local link features concurrently. The\nexperiments on real Internet topological data validate the effectiveness of our\nmethod, i.e., AS-GCN achieves comparable results on the easy binary\nclassification task, and outperforms a series of baselines on the more\ndifficult multi-classification task, with the overall accuracy above 95%.",

Quantifying uncertainty accompanied by point\nestimation is essential because it mitigates model unfairness and permits\npractitioners to develop trustworthy systems which abstain from suboptimal\ndecisions due to low confidence. Explicitly, assessing uncertainties associated\nwith DNNs predictions is critical in real-world card fraud detection settings\nfor characteristic reasons, including (a) fraudsters constantly change their\nstrategies, and accordingly, DNNs encounter observations that are not generated\nby the same process as the training distribution, (b) owing to the\ntime-consuming process, very few transactions are timely checked by\nprofessional experts to update DNNs.

    "abstract": "In this paper, a generalized macromodeling approach is presented to simulate\ncomplex electromagnetic (EM) surfaces consisting of unit cells with connected\nconductors. Macromodels of each unit cell are produced by applying the\nequivalence principle on fictitious surfaces encapsulating them. Unit cells\noften consist of multiple dielectric layers and conductor traces, featuring\nmultiscale structures. Challenges arise when a current-carrying conductor trace\ntraverses the fictitious surface. Hence, a new method based on half\nRao-Wilton-Glisson basis functions is proposed to accurately ensure the\ncontinuity of the surface currents and avoid singularities at the\nintersections. The accuracy of the proposed approach is validated by comparing\nthe results with commercial solvers for different EM surfaces.",

    "abstract": "Propagation characteristics of a wave are defined by the dispersion\nrelationship, from which the governing partial differential equation (PDE) can\nbe recovered. PDEs are commonly solved numerically using the finite-difference\n(FD) method, with stencils constructed from truncated Taylor series expansions\nwhich, whilst typically providing good approximation of the PDE in the\nspace-time domain, often differ considerably from the original partial\ndifferential in the wavenumber-frequency domain where the dispersion\nrelationship is defined. Consequentially, stable, high-order FD schemes may not\nnecessarily result in realistic wave behavior, commonly exhibiting numerical\ndispersion: lagging high-frequency components as a product of discretization. A\nmethod for optimizing FD stencil weightings via constrained minimization to\nbetter approximate the partial derivative in the wavenumber domain is proposed,\nallowing for accurate propagation with coarser grids than would be otherwise\npossible. This was applied to second derivatives on a standard grid and first\nderivatives on a staggered grid. To evaluate the efficacy of the method, a pair\nof numerical simulations were devised to compare spatially-optimized stencils\nwith conventional formulations of equivalent extent. A spatially-optimized\nformulation of the 1D acoustic wave equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions\nis presented, evaluating performance at a range of grid spacings, examining the\ninterval between the theoretical maximum grid spacings for the conventional and\noptimized schemes in finer detail. The optimized scheme was found to offer\nsuperior performance for undersampled wavefields and heavily oversampled\nwavefields.

    "abstract": "Robustness against word substitutions has a well-defined and widely\nacceptable form, i.e., using semantically similar words as substitutions, and\nthus it is considered as a fundamental stepping-stone towards broader\nrobustness in natural language processing. Previous defense methods capture\nword substitutions in vector space by using either $l_2$-ball or\nhyper-rectangle, which results in perturbation sets that are not inclusive\nenough or unnecessarily large, and thus impedes mimicry of worst cases for\nrobust training. In this paper, we introduce a novel \\textit{Adversarial Sparse\nConvex Combination} (ASCC) method. We model the word substitution attack space\nas a convex hull and leverages a regularization term to enforce perturbation\ntowards an actual substitution, thus aligning our modeling better with the\ndiscrete textual space. Based on the ASCC method, we further propose\nASCC-defense, which leverages ASCC to generate worst-case perturbations and\nincorporates adversarial training towards robustness. Experiments show that\nASCC-defense outperforms the current state-of-the-arts in terms of robustness\non two prevailing NLP tasks, \\emph{i.e.}, sentiment analysis and natural\nlanguage inference, concerning several attacks across multiple model\narchitectures. Besides, we also envision a new class of defense towards\nrobustness in NLP, where our robustly trained word vectors can be plugged into\na normally trained model and enforce its robustness without applying any other\ndefense techniques.",

    "abstract": "A non-centralized model predictive control (MPC) scheme for solving an\neconomic dispatch problem of electrical networks is proposed in this paper. The\nscheme consists of two parts. The first part is an event-triggered\nrepartitioning method that splits the network into a fixed number of\nnon-overlapping sub-systems {(microgrids)}. The objective of the repartitioning\nprocedure is to obtain self-sufficient microgrids, i.e., those that can meet\ntheir local loads using their own generation units. However, since the\nalgorithm does not guarantee that all the resulting microgrids are\nself-sufficient, the microgrids that are not self-sufficient must then form a\ncoalition with some of their neighboring microgrids. This process becomes the\nsecond part of the scheme. By performing the coalition formation, we can\ndecompose the economic dispatch problem of the network into coalition-based\nsub-problems such that each subproblem is feasible. Furthermore, we also show\nthat the solution obtained by solving the coalition-based sub-problems is a\nfeasible but sub-optimal solution to the centralized problem.

    "abstract": "On-demand delivery has become increasingly popular around the world.\nBrick-and-mortar grocery stores, restaurants, and pharmacies are providing fast\ndelivery services to satisfy the growing home delivery demand. Motivated by a\nlarge meal and grocery delivery company, we model and solve a multiperiod\ndriver dispatching and routing problem for last-mile delivery systems where\non-time performance is the main target. The operator of this system needs to\ndispatch a set of drivers and specify their delivery routes in a stochastic\nenvironment, in which random demand arrives over a fixed number of periods. The\nresulting dynamic program is challenging to solve due to the curse of\ndimensionality. We propose a novel approximation framework to approximate the\nvalue function via a simplified dispatching program. We then develop efficient\nexact algorithms for this problem based on Benders decomposition and column\ngeneration. We validate the superior performance of our framework and\nalgorithms via extensive numerical experiments. Tested on a real-world data\nset, we quantify the value of adaptive dispatching and routing in on-time\ndelivery and highlight the need of coordinating these two decisions in a\ndynamic setting.

    "abstract": "Piecewise Linear Interface Construction (PLIC) is frequently used to\ngeometrically reconstruct fluid interfaces in Computational Fluid Dynamics\n(CFD) modeling of two-phase flows. PLIC reconstructs interfaces from a scalar\nfield that represents the volume fraction of each phase in each computational\ncell. Given the volume fraction and interface normal, the location of a linear\ninterface is uniquely defined. For a cubic computational cell (3D), the\nposition of the planar interface is determined by intersecting the cube with a\nplane, such that the volume of the resulting truncated polyhedron cell is equal\nto the volume fraction. Yet it is geometrically complex to find the exact\nposition of the plane, and it involves calculations that can be a computational\nbottleneck of many CFD models. However, while the forward problem of 3D PLIC is\nchallenging, the inverse problem, of finding the volume of the truncated\npolyhedron cell given a defined plane, is simple. In this work, we propose a\ndeep learning model for the solution to the forward problem of PLIC by only\nmaking use of its inverse problem. The proposed model is up to several orders\nof magnitude faster than traditional schemes, which significantly reduces the\ncomputational bottleneck of PLIC in CFD simulations.",

The emerging\ncomputer-aided diagnostic methods that combine deep learning with structural\nmagnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) have achieved encouraging results, but some\nof them are limit of issues such as data leakage and unexplainable diagnosis.\nIn this research, we propose a novel end-to-end deep learning approach for\nautomated diagnosis of AD and localization of important brain regions related\nto the disease from sMRI data. This approach is based on a 2D single model\nstrategy and has the following differences from the current approaches: 1)\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) models of different structures and\ncapacities are evaluated systemically and the most suitable model is adopted\nfor AD diagnosis; 2) a data augmentation strategy named Two-stage Random\nRandAugment (TRRA) is proposed to alleviate the overfitting issue caused by\nlimited training data and to improve the classification performance in AD\ndiagnosis; 3) an explainable method of Grad-CAM++ is introduced to generate the\nvisually explainable heatmaps that localize and highlight the brain regions\nthat our model focuses on and to make our model more transparent.

    "title": "Synthesis of Output-Feedback Controllers for Mixed Traffic Systems in  Presence of Disturbances and Uncertainties",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we study mixed traffic systems that move along a single-lane\nring-road or open-road. The traffic flow forms a platoon, which includes a\nnumber of heterogeneous human-driven vehicles (HDVs) together with only one\nconnected and automated vehicle (CAV) that receives information from several\nneighbors. The dynamics of HDVs are assumed to follow the optimal velocity\nmodel (OVM), and the acceleration of the single CAV is directly controlled by a\ndynamical output-feedback controller. The ultimate goal of this work is to\npresent a robust control strategy that can smoothen the traffic flow in the\npresence of undesired disturbances (e.g. abrupt deceleration) and parametric\nuncertainties. A prerequisite for synthesizing a dynamical output controller is\nthe stabilizability and detectability of the underlying system. Accordingly, a\ntheoretical analysis is presented first to prove the stabilizability and\ndetectability of the mixed traffic flow system. Then, two H-infinity control\nstrategies, with and without considering uncertainties in the system dynamics,\nare designed. The efficiency of the two control methods is subsequently\nillustrated through numerical simulations, and various experimental results are\npresented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller to\nmitigate disturbance amplification and achieve platoon stability.",

Detecting the disease early\nincreases the chances of survival of the patient and there are several ways a\nsign of heart disease can be detected early. This research proposes to convert\ncleansed and normalized heart sound into visual mel scale spectrograms and then\nusing visual domain transfer learning approaches to automatically extract\nfeatures and categorize between heart sounds. Some of the previous studies\nfound that the spectrogram of various types of heart sounds is visually\ndistinguishable to human eyes, which motivated this study to experiment on\nvisual domain classification approaches for automated heart sound\nclassification. It will use convolution neural network-based architectures i.e.\nResNet, MobileNetV2, etc as the automated feature extractors from spectrograms.\nThese well-accepted models in the image domain showed to learn generalized\nfeature representations of cardiac sounds collected from different environments\nwith varying amplitude and noise levels. Model evaluation criteria used were\ncategorical accuracy, precision, recall, and AUROC as the chosen dataset is\nunbalanced. The proposed approach has been implemented on datasets A and B of\nthe PASCAL heart sound collection and resulted in ~ 90% categorical accuracy\nand AUROC of ~0.97 for both sets.",

To detect and localize coughing\nsounds remotely, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based deep learning model\nwas developed in this work and integrated with a sound camera for the\nvisualization of the cough sounds. The cough detection model is a binary\nclassifier of which the input is a two second acoustic feature and the output\nis one of two inferences (Cough or Others). Data augmentation was performed on\nthe collected audio files to alleviate class imbalance and reflect various\nbackground noises in practical environments. For effective featuring of the\ncough sound, conventional features such as spectrograms, mel-scaled\nspectrograms, and mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) were reinforced by\nutilizing their velocity (V) and acceleration (A) maps in this work. VGGNet,\nGoogLeNet, and ResNet were simplified to binary classifiers, and were named\nV-net, G-net, and R-net, respectively. To find the best combination of features\nand networks, training was performed for a total of 39 cases and the\nperformance was confirmed using the test F1 score. Finally, a test F1 score of\n91.9% (test accuracy of 97.2%) was achieved from G-net with the MFCC-V-A\nfeature (named Spectroflow), an acoustic feature effective for use in cough\ndetection. The trained cough detection model was integrated with a sound camera\n(i.e., one that visualizes sound sources using a beamforming microphone array).\nIn a pilot test, the cough detection camera detected coughing sounds with an F1\nscore of 90.0% (accuracy of 96.0%), and the cough location in the camera image\nwas tracked in real time.",

    "abstract": "The emergence and progression of multiple chronic conditions (MCC) over time\noften form a dynamic network that depends on patient's modifiable risk factors\nand their interaction with non-modifiable risk factors and existing conditions.\nContinuous time Bayesian networks (CTBNs) are effective methods for modeling\nthe complex network of MCC relationships over time. However, CTBNs are not able\nto effectively formulate the dynamic impact of patient's modifiable risk\nfactors on the emergence and progression of MCC. Considering a functional CTBN\n(FCTBN) to represent the underlying structure of the MCC relationships with\nrespect to individuals' risk factors and existing conditions, we propose a\nnonlinear state-space model based on Extended Kalman filter (EKF) to capture\nthe dynamics of the patients' modifiable risk factors and existing conditions\non the MCC evolution over time.

We\nvalidate the proposed approach based on a combination of simulation and real\ndata from a dataset of 385 patients from Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC)\nover multiple years. The dataset examines the emergence of 5 chronic conditions\n(Diabetes, Obesity, Cognitive Impairment, Hyperlipidemia, and Hypertension)\nbased on 4 modifiable risk factors representing lifestyle behaviors (Diet,\nExercise, Smoking Habit, and Drinking Habit) and 3 non-modifiable risk factors,\nincluding demographic information (Age, Gender, Education).

By developing SPADs in\narray format with integrated processing combined with pulsed, flood-type\nillumination, high-speed 3D capture is possible. However, array sizes tend to\nbe relatively small, limiting the lateral resolution of the resulting depth\nmaps, and, consequently, the information that can be extracted from the image\nfor applications such as object detection. In this paper, we demonstrate that\nthese limitations can be overcome through the use of convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) for high-performance object detection. We present outdoor\nresults from a portable SPAD camera system that outputs 16-bin photon timing\nhistograms with 64x32 spatial resolution. The results, obtained with exposure\ntimes down to 2 ms (equivalent to 500 FPS) and in signal-to-background (SBR)\nratios as low as 0.05, point to the advantages of providing the CNN with full\nhistogram data rather than point clouds alone. Alternatively, a combination of\npoint cloud and active intensity data may be used as input, for a similar level\nof performance. In either case, the GPU-accelerated processing time is less\nthan 1 ms per frame, leading to an overall latency (image acquisition plus\nprocessing) in the millisecond range, making the results relevant for\nsafety-critical computer vision applications which would benefit from faster\nthan human reaction times.",

    "title": "Queue-Channel Capacities with Generalized Amplitude Damping",
    "abstract": "The generalized amplitude damping channel (GADC) is considered an important\nmodel for quantum communications, especially over optical networks. We make two\nsalient contributions in this paper apropos of this channel. First, we consider\na symmetric GAD channel characterized by the parameter $n=1/2,$ and derive its\nexact classical capacity, by constructing a specific induced classical channel.\nWe show that the Holevo quantity for the GAD channel equals the Shannon\ncapacity of the induced binary symmetric channel, establishing at once the\ncapacity result and that the GAD channel capacity can be achieved without the\nuse of entanglement at the encoder or joint measurements at the decoder.\nSecond, motivated by the inevitable buffering of qubits in quantum networks, we\nconsider a generalized amplitude damping \\emph{queue-channel} -- that is, a\nsetting where qubits suffer a waiting time dependent GAD noise as they wait in\na buffer to be transmitted. This GAD queue channel is characterized by\nnon-i.i.d. noise due to correlated waiting times of consecutive qubits. We\nexploit a conditional independence property in conjunction with additivity of\nthe channel model, to obtain a capacity expression for the GAD queue channel in\nterms of the stationary waiting time in the queue. Our results provide useful\ninsights towards designing practical quantum communication networks, and\nhighlight the need to explicitly model the impact of buffering.",

    "title": "Supervised Learning and the Finite-Temperature String Method for  Computing Committor Functions and Reaction Rates",
    "abstract": "A central object in the computational studies of rare events is the committor\nfunction. Though costly to compute, the committor function encodes complete\nmechanistic information of the processes involving rare events, including\nreaction rates and transition-state ensembles. Under the framework of\ntransition path theory (TPT), recent work [1] proposes an algorithm where a\nfeedback loop couples a neural network that models the committor function with\nimportance sampling, mainly umbrella sampling, which collects data needed for\nadaptive training. In this work, we show additional modifications are needed to\nimprove the accuracy of the algorithm. The first modification adds elements of\nsupervised learning, which allows the neural network to improve its prediction\nby fitting to sample-mean estimates of committor values obtained from short\nmolecular dynamics trajectories. The second modification replaces the\ncommittor-based umbrella sampling with the finite-temperature string (FTS)\nmethod, which enables homogeneous sampling in regions where transition pathways\nare located. We test our modifications on low-dimensional systems with\nnon-convex potential energy where reference solutions can be found via\nanalytical or the finite element methods, and show how combining supervised\nlearning and the FTS method yields accurate computation of committor functions\nand reaction rates. We also provide an error analysis for algorithms that use\nthe FTS method, using which reaction rates can be accurately estimated during\ntraining with a small number of samples.",

    "abstract": "We present a method for continual learning of speech representations for\nmultiple languages using self-supervised learning (SSL) and applying these for\nautomatic speech recognition. There is an abundance of unannotated speech, so\ncreating self-supervised representations from raw audio and finetuning on a\nsmall annotated datasets is a promising direction to build speech recognition\nsystems. Wav2vec models perform SSL on raw audio in a pretraining phase and\nthen finetune on a small fraction of annotated data. SSL models have produced\nstate of the art results for ASR. However, these models are very expensive to\npretrain with self-supervision. We tackle the problem of learning new language\nrepresentations continually from audio without forgetting a previous language\nrepresentation. We use ideas from continual learning to transfer knowledge from\na previous task to speed up pretraining a new language task. Our\ncontinual-wav2vec2 model can decrease pretraining times by 32% when learning a\nnew language task, and learn this new audio-language representation without\nforgetting previous language representation.",

A Bayesian\ntechnique is used in the estimation process, to take into account the\nuncertainties and variabilities intrinsic to the measurement taken, which are\nmodeled as a noise of Gaussian nature. With this procedure it is expected to\ncheck the reliability of the nominal values of the physical parameters of the\ntest rig. An estimation process assuming that nine parameters of the\nexperimental apparatus are unknown is conducted, and the results show that for\nsome quantities the relative deviation with respect to the nominal values is\nvery high. This deviation evidentiates a strong deficiency in the mathematical\nmodel used to describe the dynamic behavior of the experimental apparatus.",

    "abstract": "Accurate topology is key when performing meaningful anatomical segmentations,\nhowever, it is often overlooked in traditional deep learning methods. In this\nwork we propose TEDS-Net: a novel segmentation method that guarantees accurate\ntopology. Our method is built upon a continuous diffeomorphic framework, which\nenforces topology preservation. However, in practice, diffeomorphic fields are\nrepresented using a finite number of parameters and sampled using methods such\nas linear interpolation, violating the theoretical guarantees. We therefore\nintroduce additional modifications to more strictly enforce it. Our network\nlearns how to warp a binary prior, with the desired topological\ncharacteristics, to complete the segmentation task. We tested our method on\nmyocardium segmentation from an open-source 2D heart dataset. TEDS-Net\npreserved topology in 100% of the cases, compared to 90% from the U-Net,\nwithout sacrificing on Hausdorff Distance or Dice performance.
