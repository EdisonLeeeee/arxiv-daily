    "abstract": "The Transformer model is widely used in natural language processing for\nsentence representation. However, the previous Transformer-based models focus\non function words that have limited meaning in most cases and could merely\nextract high-level semantic abstraction features. In this paper, two approaches\nare introduced to improve the performance of Transformers. We calculated the\nattention score by multiplying the part-of-speech weight vector with the\ncorrelation coefficient, which helps extract the words with more practical\nmeaning. The weight vector is obtained by the input text sequence based on the\nimportance of the part-of-speech. Furthermore, we fuse the features of each\nlayer to make the sentence representation results more comprehensive and\naccurate. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model\nTransformer-F on three standard text classification datasets. Experimental\nresults show that our proposed model significantly boosts the performance of\ntext classification as compared to the baseline model. Specifically, we obtain\na 5.28% relative improvement over the vanilla Transformer on the simple tasks.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain's immutability can resist unauthorized changes of ledgers, thus it\ncan be used as a trust enhancement mechanism to a shared system. Indeed,\nblockchain has been considered to solve the security and privacy issues of the\nInternet of Things (IoT). In this regard, most researches currently focus on\nthe realization of various access control models and architectures, and are\nworking towards making full use of the blockchain to secure IoT systems. It is\nworth noting that there has been an increasingly heavy pressure on the\nblockchain storage caused by dealing with massive IoT data and handling\nmalicious access behaviors in the system, and not many countermeasures have\nbeen seen to curb the increase. However, this problem has not been paid enough\nattention. In this paper, we implement an attribute-based access control scheme\nusing smart contracts in Quorum blockchain. It provides basic access control\nfunctions and conserves storage by reducing the number of smart contracts. In\naddition, a reputation-based technique is introduced to cope with malicious\nbehaviors. Certain illegal transactions can be blocked by the credit-assessment\nalgorithm, which deters possibly malicious nodes and gives more chance to\nwell-behaved nodes. The feasibility of our proposed scheme is demonstrated by\ndoing experiment on a testbed and conducting a case study. Finally, the system\nperformance is assessed based on experimental measurement.",

    "abstract": "Long horizon sequential manipulation tasks are effectively addressed\nhierarchically: at a high level of abstraction the planner searches over\nabstract action sequences, and when a plan is found, lower level motion plans\nare generated. Such a strategy hinges on the ability to reliably predict that a\nfeasible low level plan will be found which satisfies the abstract plan.\nHowever, computing Abstract Plan Feasibility (APF) is difficult because the\noutcome of a plan depends on real-world phenomena that are difficult to model,\nsuch as noise in estimation and execution. In this work, we present an active\nlearning approach to efficiently acquire an APF predictor through\ntask-independent, curious exploration on a robot. The robot identifies plans\nwhose outcomes would be informative about APF, executes those plans, and learns\nfrom their successes or failures. Critically, we leverage an infeasible\nsubsequence property to prune candidate plans in the active learning strategy,\nallowing our system to learn from less data. We evaluate our strategy in\nsimulation and on a real Franka Emika Panda robot with integrated perception,\nexperimentation, planning, and execution. In a stacking domain where objects\nhave non-uniform mass distributions, we show that our system permits real robot\nlearning of an APF model in four hundred self-supervised interactions, and that\nour learned model can be used effectively in multiple downstream tasks.",

Suppose we are given a sequence of $n$ points $(s_1,s_2,\\ldots,\ns_n)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, where point $s_i$ is presented in step~$i$ for\n$i=1,\\ldots, n$. The objective of an online algorithm is to maintain a\ngeometric $t$-spanner on $S_i=\\{s_1,\\ldots, s_i\\}$ for each step~$i$.\nFirst, we establish a lower bound of $\\Omega(\\varepsilon^{-1}\\log n / \\log\n\\varepsilon^{-1})$ for the competitive ratio of any online\n$(1+\\varepsilon)$-spanner algorithm, for a sequence of $n$ points in\n1-dimension. We show that this bound is tight, and there is an online algorithm\nthat can maintain a $(1+\\varepsilon)$-spanner with competitive ratio\n$O(\\varepsilon^{-1}\\log n / \\log \\varepsilon^{-1})$. Next, we design online\nalgorithms for sequences of points in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, for any constant $d\\ge\n2$, under the $L_2$ norm. We show that previously known incremental algorithms\nachieve a competitive ratio $O(\\varepsilon^{-(d+1)}\\log n)$.

The recent developments in supervised machine\nlearning and neural networks have enjoyed great success in enhancing the\nperformance of the state-of-the-art techniques for this task.

In this paper, we propose a novel fully unsupervised\nsemantic segmentation method, the so-called Information Maximization and\nAdversarial Regularization Segmentation (InMARS). Inspired by human perception\nwhich parses a scene into perceptual groups, rather than analyzing each pixel\nindividually, our proposed approach first partitions an input image into\nmeaningful regions (also known as superpixels). Next, it utilizes\nMutual-Information-Maximization followed by an adversarial training strategy to\ncluster these regions into semantically meaningful classes. To customize an\nadversarial training scheme for the problem, we incorporate adversarial pixel\nnoise along with spatial perturbations to impose photometrical and geometrical\ninvariance on the deep neural network.

The recent blind SR studies\naddress this issue via degradation estimation, but they do not generalize well\nto multi-source degradation and cannot handle spatially variant degradation. We\ndesign CRL-SR, a contrastive representation learning network that focuses on\nblind SR of images with multi-modal and spatially variant distributions. CRL-SR\naddresses the blind SR challenges from two perspectives. The first is\ncontrastive decoupling encoding which introduces contrastive learning to\nextract resolution-invariant embedding and discard resolution-variant embedding\nunder the guidance of a bidirectional contrastive loss. The second is\ncontrastive feature refinement which generates lost or corrupted high-frequency\ndetails under the guidance of a conditional contrastive loss.

    "title": "Formation of coalition structures as a non-cooperative game",
    "abstract": "We study coalition structure formation with intra and inter-coalition\nexternalities in the introduced family of nested non-cooperative simultaneous\nfinite games. A non-cooperative game embeds a coalition structure formation\nmechanism, and has two outcomes: an allocation of players over coalitions and a\npayoff for every player. Coalition structures of a game are described by Young\ndiagrams. They serve to enumerate coalition structures and allocations of\nplayers over them. For every coalition structure a player has a set of finite\nstrategies. A player chooses a coalition structure and a strategy.\nA (social) mechanism eliminates conflicts in individual choices and produces\nfinal coalition structures. Every final coalition structure is a\nnon-cooperative game. Mixed equilibrium always exists and consists of a mixed\nstrategy profile, payoffs and equilibrium coalition structures. We use a\nmaximum coalition size to parametrize the family of the games. The\nnon-cooperative game of Nash is a partial case of the model. The result is\ndifferent from the Shapley value, a strong Nash, coalition-proof equilibria,\ncore solutions, and other equilibrium concepts. We supply few non-cooperative\ncoalition structure stability criteria.",

    "abstract": "In real life, people communicate using both speech and non-verbal signals\nsuch as gestures, face expression or body pose. Non-verbal signals impact the\nmeaning of the spoken utterance in an abundance of ways. An absence of\nnon-verbal signals impoverishes the process of communication. Yet, when users\nare represented as avatars, it is difficult to translate non-verbal signals\nalong with the speech into the virtual world without specialized motion-capture\nhardware. In this paper, we propose a novel, data-driven technique for\ngenerating gestures directly from speech. Our approach is based on the\napplication of Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (GANs) to model the\ncorrelation rather than causation between speech and gestures. This approach\napproximates neuroscience findings on how non-verbal communication and speech\nare correlated. We create a large dataset which consists of speech and\ncorresponding gestures in a 3D human pose format from which our model learns\nthe speaker-specific correlation. We evaluate the proposed technique in a user\nstudy that is inspired by the Turing test. For the study, we animate the\ngenerated gestures on a virtual character. We find that users are not able to\ndistinguish between the generated and the recorded gestures. Moreover, users\nare able to identify our synthesized gestures as related or not related to a\ngiven utterance.",

    "abstract": "In pursuit of explainability, we develop generative models for sequential\ndata. The proposed models provide state-of-the-art classification results and\nrobust performance for speech phone classification. We combine modern neural\nnetworks (normalizing flows) and traditional generative models (hidden Markov\nmodels - HMMs). Normalizing flow-based mixture models (NMMs) are used to model\nthe conditional probability distribution given the hidden state in the HMMs.\nModel parameters are learned through judicious combinations of time-tested\nBayesian learning methods and contemporary neural network learning methods. We\nmainly combine expectation-maximization (EM) and mini-batch gradient descent.\nThe proposed generative models can compute likelihood of a data and hence\ndirectly suitable for maximum-likelihood (ML) classification approach. Due to\nstructural flexibility of HMMs, we can use different normalizing flow models.\nThis leads to different types of HMMs providing diversity in data modeling\ncapacity. The diversity provides an opportunity for easy decision fusion from\ndifferent models. For a standard speech phone classification setup involving 39\nphones (classes) and the TIMIT dataset, we show that the use of standard\nfeatures called mel-frequency-cepstral-coeffcients (MFCCs), the proposed\ngenerative models, and the decision fusion together can achieve $86.6\\%$\naccuracy by generative training only.

In order to provide a benchmark and to highlight the\nobtained results, the innovative teaching approaches were compared to\nconventional methods taught on the same senior course in a previous semester.\nBased on the feedback from teachers and students from previously conducted case\nstudy it was believed that the MPL approach would support the students.

An example of a\nconceptual model is a description developed using the Unified Modeling Language\n(UML). UML uses a model multiplicity formulation approach, wherein a number of\nmodels are used to represent alternative views. By contrast, a model\nsingularity approach uses only a single integrated model. Each of these styles\nof modeling has its strengths and weaknesses. This paper introduces a partial\nsolution to the issue of multiplicity vs. singularity in modeling by adopting\nUML use cases and class models into the conceptual thinging machine (TM) model.\nTo apply use cases, we adopt the observation that a use-case diagram is a\ndescription that shows the internal structure of the part of the system\nrepresented by the use case in addition to being useful to people outside of\nthe system. Additionally, the UML class diagram is recast in TM representation.\nAccordingly, we develop a TMUML model that embraces the TM specification of the\nUML class diagram and the internal structure extracted from the UML use case.\nTMUML modeling introduces some of the advantages that have made UML a popular\nmodeling language to TM modeling. At the same time, this approach supplies UML\nwith partial model singularity. The paper details experimentation with TMUML\nusing examples from the literature.

To improve the rental service, available bikes should be distributed over\nthe entire service area: a customer leaving from any position is then more\nlikely to find a near bike and then to use the service. Moreover, spreading\nbikes among the entire service area increases urban spatial equity since the\nbenefits of FFBSS are not a prerogative of just a few zones. For guaranteeing\nsuch distribution, the FFBSS operator can use vans to manually relocate bikes,\nbut it incurs high economic and environmental costs. We propose a novel\napproach that exploits the existing bike flows generated by customers to\ndistribute bikes. More specifically, by envisioning the problem as an Influence\nMaximization problem, we show that it is possible to position batches of bikes\non a small number of zones, and then the daily use of FFBSS will efficiently\nspread these bikes on a large area. We show that detecting these areas is\nNP-complete, but there exists a simple and efficient $1-1/e$ approximation\nalgorithm; our approach is then evaluated on a dataset of rides from the\nfree-floating bike-sharing system of the city of Padova.",

This setting presents several key challenges, including\nprocessing and exchanging unregistered robotic swarm imagery. To be successful,\nsolutions must effectively leverage multiple non-static and\nintermittently-overlapping RGB perspectives, while heeding bandwidth\nconstraints and overcoming unwanted foreground obstructions. As such, we\npropose an end-to-end learn-able Multi-Agent Spatial Handshaking network (MASH)\nto process, compress, and propagate visual information across a robotic swarm.\nOur distributed communication module operates directly (and exclusively) on raw\nimage data, without additional input requirements such as pose, depth, or\nwarping data. We demonstrate superior performance of our model compared against\nseveral baselines in a photo-realistic multi-robot AirSim environment,\nespecially in the presence of image occlusions. Our method achieves an absolute\n11% IoU improvement over strong baselines.",

    "abstract": "Quadrupeds are strong candidates for navigating challenging environments\nbecause of their agile and dynamic designs. This paper presents a methodology\nthat extends the range of exploration for quadrupedal robots by creating an\nend-to-end navigation framework that exploits walking and jumping modes. To\nobtain a dynamic jumping maneuver while avoiding obstacles,\ndynamically-feasible trajectories are optimized offline through\ncollocation-based optimization where safety constraints are imposed. Such\noptimization schematic allows the robot to jump through window-shaped obstacles\nby considering both obstacles in the air and on the ground. The resulted\njumping mode is utilized in an autonomous navigation pipeline that leverages a\nsearch-based global planner and a local planner to enable the robot to reach\nthe goal location by walking. A state machine together with a decision making\nstrategy allows the system to switch behaviors between walking around obstacles\nor jumping through them. The proposed framework is experimentally deployed and\nvalidated on a quadrupedal robot, a Mini Cheetah, to enable the robot to\nautonomously navigate through an environment while avoiding obstacles and\njumping over a maximum height of 13 cm to pass through a window-shaped opening\nin order to reach its goal.",

These regression problems are very challenging particularly because they\nrequire, at low computation overheads, modeling long-range dependencies on\nhigh-resolution inputs/outputs to estimate the highly nonlinear pixel-wise\nsemantics. While attention mechanisms in Deep Convolutional Neural\nNetworks(DCNNs) has become popular for boosting long-range dependencies,\nelement-specific attention, such as Nonlocal blocks, is highly complex and\nnoise-sensitive to learn, and most of simplified attention hybrids try to reach\nthe best compromise among multiple types of tasks. In this paper, we present\nthe Polarized Self-Attention(PSA) block that incorporates two critical designs\ntowards high-quality pixel-wise regression: (1) Polarized filtering: keeping\nhigh internal resolution in both channel and spatial attention computation\nwhile completely collapsing input tensors along their counterpart dimensions.\n(2) Enhancement: composing non-linearity that directly fits the output\ndistribution of typical fine-grained regression, such as the 2D Gaussian\ndistribution (keypoint heatmaps), or the 2D Binormial distribution (binary\nsegmentation masks). PSA appears to have exhausted the representation capacity\nwithin its channel-only and spatial-only branches, such that there is only\nmarginal metric differences between its sequential and parallel layouts.\nExperimental results show that PSA boosts standard baselines by $2-4$ points,\nand boosts state-of-the-arts by $1-2$ points on 2D pose estimation and semantic\nsegmentation benchmarks.",

As attackers become increasingly\nsophisticated and resourceful, mere reliance on traditional cyber protection,\nsuch as intrusion detection, firewalls, and encryption, is insufficient to\nsecure cyber systems. Cyber resilience provides a new security paradigm that\ncomplements inadequate protection with resilience mechanisms. A Cyber-Resilient\nMechanism (CRM) adapts to the known or zero-day threats and uncertainties in\nreal-time and strategically responds to them to maintain the critical functions\nof the cyber systems. Feedback architectures play a pivotal role in enabling\nthe online sensing, reasoning, and actuation of the CRM. Reinforcement Learning\n(RL) is an important class of algorithms that epitomize the feedback\narchitectures for cyber resiliency, allowing the CRM to provide dynamic and\nsequential responses to attacks with limited prior knowledge of the attacker.\nIn this work, we review the literature on RL for cyber resiliency and discuss\nthe cyber-resilient defenses against three major types of vulnerabilities,\ni.e., posture-related, information-related, and human-related vulnerabilities.\nWe introduce moving target defense, defensive cyber deception, and assistive\nhuman security technologies as three application domains of CRMs to elaborate\non their designs.

    "abstract": "One of the central elements of any causal inference is an object called\nstructural causal model (SCM), which represents a collection of mechanisms and\nexogenous sources of random variation of the system under investigation (Pearl,\n2000). An important property of many kinds of neural networks is universal\napproximability: the ability to approximate any function to arbitrary\nprecision. Given this property, one may be tempted to surmise that a collection\nof neural nets is capable of learning any SCM by training on data generated by\nthat SCM. In this paper, we show this is not the case by disentangling the\nnotions of expressivity and learnability. Specifically, we show that the causal\nhierarchy theorem (Thm. 1, Bareinboim et al., 2020), which describes the limits\nof what can be learned from data, still holds for neural models. For instance,\nan arbitrarily complex and expressive neural net is unable to predict the\neffects of interventions given observational data alone. Given this result, we\nintroduce a special type of SCM called a neural causal model (NCM), and\nformalize a new type of inductive bias to encode structural constraints\nnecessary for performing causal inferences. Building on this new class of\nmodels, we focus on solving two canonical tasks found in the literature known\nas causal identification and estimation. Leveraging the neural toolbox, we\ndevelop an algorithm that is both sufficient and necessary to determine whether\na causal effect can be learned from data (i.e., causal identifiability); it\nthen estimates the effect whenever identifiability holds (causal estimation).\nSimulations corroborate the proposed approach.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by finite volume scheme, a cell-average based neural network method\nis proposed. The method is based on the integral or weak formulation of partial\ndifferential equations. A simple feed forward network is forced to learn the\nsolution average evolution between two neighboring time steps. Offline\nsupervised training is carried out to obtain the optimal network parameter set,\nwhich uniquely identifies one finite volume like neural network method. Once\nwell trained, the network method is implemented as a finite volume scheme, thus\nis mesh dependent. Different to traditional numerical methods, our method can\nbe relieved from the explicit scheme CFL restriction and can adapt to any time\nstep size for solution evolution. For Heat equation, first order of convergence\nis observed and the errors are related to the spatial mesh size but are\nobserved independent of the mesh size in time. The cell-average based neural\nnetwork method can sharply evolve contact discontinuity with almost zero\nnumerical diffusion introduced. Shock and rarefaction waves are well captured\nfor nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws.",

The proposed method can\nselect a subset of relevant features in a target task given a few unlabeled\ntarget instances by training with unlabeled instances in multiple source tasks.\nOur model consists of a feature selector and decoder. The feature selector\noutputs a subset of relevant features taking a few unlabeled instances as input\nsuch that the decoder can reconstruct the original features of unseen instances\nfrom the selected ones. The feature selector uses the Concrete random variables\nto select features via gradient descent. To encode task-specific properties\nfrom a few unlabeled instances to the model, the Concrete random variables and\ndecoder are modeled using permutation-invariant neural networks that take a few\nunlabeled instances as input. Our model is trained by minimizing the expected\ntest reconstruction error given a few unlabeled instances that is calculated\nwith datasets in source tasks.

    "abstract": "In this work, we address the problem of cross-view geo-localization, which\nestimates the geospatial location of a street view image by matching it with a\ndatabase of geo-tagged aerial images. The cross-view matching task is extremely\nchallenging due to drastic appearance and geometry differences across views.\nUnlike existing methods that predominantly fall back on CNN, here we devise a\nnovel evolving geo-localization Transformer (EgoTR) that utilizes the\nproperties of self-attention in Transformer to model global dependencies, thus\nsignificantly decreasing visual ambiguities in cross-view geo-localization. We\nalso exploit the positional encoding of Transformer to help the EgoTR\nunderstand and correspond geometric configurations between ground and aerial\nimages. Compared to state-of-the-art methods that impose strong assumption on\ngeometry knowledge, the EgoTR flexibly learns the positional embeddings through\nthe training objective and hence becomes more practical in many real-world\nscenarios. Although Transformer is well suited to our task, its vanilla\nself-attention mechanism independently interacts within image patches in each\nlayer, which overlooks correlations between layers. Instead, this paper propose\na simple yet effective self-cross attention mechanism to improve the quality of\nlearned representations. The self-cross attention models global dependencies\nbetween adjacent layers, which relates between image patches while modeling how\nfeatures evolve in the previous layer. As a result, the proposed self-cross\nattention leads to more stable training, improves the generalization ability\nand encourages representations to keep evolving as the network goes deeper.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our EgoTR performs favorably against\nstate-of-the-art methods on standard, fine-grained and cross-dataset cross-view\ngeo-localization tasks.",

Although a\nsession can usually reflect a user's current preference, a local shift of the\nuser's intention within the session may still exist. Specifically, the\ninteractions that take place in the early positions within a session generally\nindicate the user's initial intention, while later interactions are more likely\nto represent the latest intention. Such positional information has been rarely\nconsidered in existing methods, which restricts their ability to capture the\nsignificance of interactions at different positions. To thoroughly exploit the\npositional information within a session, a theoretical framework is developed\nin this paper to provide an in-depth analysis of the positional information. We\nformally define the properties of forward-awareness and backward-awareness to\nevaluate the ability of positional encoding schemes in capturing the initial\nand the latest intention. According to our analysis, existing positional\nencoding schemes are generally forward-aware only, which can hardly represent\nthe dynamics of the intention in a session. To enhance the positional encoding\nscheme for the session-based recommendation, a dual positional encoding (DPE)\nis proposed to account for both forward-awareness and backward-awareness. Based\non DPE, we propose a novel Positional Recommender (PosRec) model with a\nwell-designed Position-aware Gated Graph Neural Network module to fully exploit\nthe positional information for session-based recommendation tasks. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted on two e-commerce benchmark datasets, Yoochoose and\nDiginetica and the experimental results show the superiority of the PosRec by\ncomparing it with the state-of-the-art session-based recommender models.",

In addition, it does not consider the cross-session\ninformation due to the anonymity of the session data, where the linkage between\ndifferent sessions is prevented. In this paper, we solve these problems with\nthe graph neural networks technique. First, each session is represented as a\ngraph rather than a linear sequence structure, based on which a novel Full\nGraph Neural Network (FGNN) is proposed to learn complicated item dependency.\nTo exploit and incorporate cross-session information in the individual\nsession's representation learning, we further construct a Broadly Connected\nSession (BCS) graph to link different sessions and a novel Mask-Readout\nfunction to improve session embedding based on the BCS graph.

    "abstract": "Modern wireless cellular networks use massive multiple-input multiple-output\n(MIMO) technology. This involves operations with an antenna array at a base\nstation that simultaneously serves multiple mobile devices that also use\nmultiple antennas on their side. For this, various Beamforming and Detection\ntechniques are used, allowing each user to receive the signal intended for him\nfrom the base station. There is an important class of linear Precoding called\nRegularized Zero-Forcing (RZF). In this work, we propose a special kind of\nregularization matrix with different regularizations for different UE (Adaptive\nRZF), using singular values of multi-antenna users. The proposed algorithm has\na simple analytical formula and is provided with theoretical study. We also\nshow the results in comparison with other linear Precoding algorithms on\nsimulations with the Quadriga channel model. The proposed approach leads to a\nsignificant increase in quality with the same computation time as in the\nbaseline methods.",

    "abstract": "The recent trend towards the high-speed transportation system has spurred the\ndevelopment of high-speed trains (HSTs). However, enabling HST users with\nseamless wireless connectivity using the roadside units (RSUs) is extremely\nchallenging, mostly due to the lack of line of sight link. To address this\nissue, we propose a novel framework that uses intelligent reflecting surfaces\n(IRS)-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to provide line of sight\ncommunication to HST users. First, we formulate the optimization problem where\nthe objective is to maximize the minimum achievable rate of HSTs by jointly\noptimizing the trajectory of UAV and the phase-shift of IRS. Due to the\nnon-convex nature of the formulated problem, it is decomposed into two\nsubproblems: IRS phase-shift problem and UAV trajectory optimization problem.\nNext, a Binary Integer Linear Programming (BILP) and a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)\nare constructed in order to solve our decomposed problems.

    "abstract": "Despite the success of recent Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods on\nvarious tasks which have shown to output networks that largely outperform\nhuman-designed networks, conventional NAS methods have mostly tackled the\noptimization of searching for the network architecture for a single task\n(dataset), which does not generalize well across multiple tasks (datasets).\nMoreover, since such task-specific methods search for a neural architecture\nfrom scratch for every given task, they incur a large computational cost, which\nis problematic when the time and monetary budget are limited. In this paper, we\npropose an efficient NAS framework that is trained once on a database\nconsisting of datasets and pretrained networks and can rapidly search for a\nneural architecture for a novel dataset. The proposed MetaD2A (Meta\nDataset-to-Architecture) model can stochastically generate graphs\n(architectures) from a given set (dataset) via a cross-modal latent space\nlearned with amortized meta-learning. Moreover, we also propose a\nmeta-performance predictor to estimate and select the best architecture without\ndirect training on target datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that\nour model meta-learned on subsets of ImageNet-1K and architectures from\nNAS-Bench 201 search space successfully generalizes to multiple unseen datasets\nincluding CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, with an average search time of 33 GPU\nseconds. Even under MobileNetV3 search space, MetaD2A is 5.5K times faster than\nNSGANetV2, a transferable NAS method, with comparable performance. We believe\nthat the MetaD2A proposes a new research direction for rapid NAS as well as\nways to utilize the knowledge from rich databases of datasets and architectures\naccumulated over the past years.

Learning and\ninference are realized locally on individual nodes; therefore, computation\nremains tractable even with a large number of variables. However, the\ndependency network's learned distribution is the stationary distribution of a\nMarkov chain called pseudo-Gibbs sampling and has no closed-form expressions.\nThis technical disadvantage has impeded the development of dependency networks.\nIn this paper, we consider a certain manifold for each node. Then, we can\ninterpret pseudo-Gibbs sampling as iterative m-projections onto these\nmanifolds. This interpretation provides a theoretical bound for the location\nwhere the stationary distribution of pseudo-Gibbs sampling exists in\ndistribution space. Furthermore, this interpretation involves structure and\nparameter learning algorithms as optimization problems. In addition, we compare\ndependency and Bayesian networks experimentally.

    "abstract": "Cyberattacks are a major issues and it causes organizations great financial,\nand reputation harm. However, due to various factors, the current network\nintrusion detection systems (NIDS) seem to be insufficent. Predominant NIDS\nidentifies Cyberattacks through a handcrafted dataset of rules. Although the\nrecent applications of machine learning and deep learning have alleviated the\nenormous effort in NIDS, the security of network data has always been a prime\nconcern. However, to encounter the security problem and enable sharing among\norganizations, Federated Learning (FL) scheme is employed. Although the current\nFL systems have been successful, a network's data distribution does not always\nfit into a single global model as in FL. Thus, in such cases, having a single\nglobal model in FL is no feasible. In this paper, we propose a\nSegmented-Federated Learning (Segmented-FL) learning scheme for a more\nefficient NIDS. The Segmented-FL approach employs periodic local model\nevaluation based on which the segmentation occurs. We aim to bring similar\nnetwork environments to the same group. Further, the Segmented-FL system is\ncoupled with a weighted aggregation of local model parameters based on the\nnumber of data samples a worker possesses to further augment the performance.\nThe improved performance by our system as compared to the FL and centralized\nsystems on standard dataset further validates our system and makes a strong\ncase for extending our technique across various tasks.

In contrast with existing works that explicitly\nmodel the behavior of human drivers and rely on their expected response to\ncreate opportunities for cooperation, our Sympathetic Cooperative Driving\n(SymCoDrive) paradigm trains altruistic agents that realize safe and smooth\ntraffic flow in competitive driving scenarios only from experiential learning\nand without any explicit coordination. We demonstrate a significant improvement\nin both safety and traffic-level metrics as a result of this altruistic\nbehavior and importantly conclude that the level of altruism in agents requires\nproper tuning as agents that are too altruistic also lead to sub-optimal\ntraffic flow.

    "abstract": "Congestion control is essential for the stability of the Internet and the\ncorresponding algorithms are commonly evaluated for interoperability based on\nflow-rate fairness. In contrast, video conferencing software such as Zoom uses\ncustom congestion control algorithms whose fairness behavior is mostly unknown.\nAggravatingly, video conferencing has recently seen a drastic increase in use -\npartly caused by the COVID-19 pandemic - and could hence negatively affect how\navailable Internet resources are shared. In this paper, we thus investigate the\nflow-rate fairness of video conferencing congestion control at the example of\nZoom and influences of deploying AQM. We find that Zoom is slow to react to\nbandwidth changes and uses two to three times the bandwidth of TCP in\nlow-bandwidth scenarios. Moreover, also when competing with delay aware\ncongestion control such as BBR, we see high queuing delays. AQM reduces these\nqueuing delays and can equalize the bandwidth use when used with flow-queuing.\nHowever, it then introduces high packet loss for Zoom, leaving the question how\ndelay and loss affect Zoom's QoE. We hence show a preliminary user study in the\nappendix which indicates that the QoE is at least not improved and should be\nstudied further.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning may enable the automated generation of test oracles. We have\ncharacterized emerging research in this area through a systematic literature\nreview examining oracle types, researcher goals, the ML techniques applied, how\nthe generation process was assessed, and the open research challenges in this\nemerging field.\nBased on a sample of 22 relevant studies, we observed that ML algorithms\ngenerated test verdict, metamorphic relation, and - most commonly - expected\noutput oracles. Almost all studies employ a supervised or semi-supervised\napproach, trained on labeled system executions or code metadata - including\nneural networks, support vector machines, adaptive boosting, and decision\ntrees. Oracles are evaluated using the mutation score, correct classifications,\naccuracy, and ROC. Work-to-date show great promise, but there are significant\nopen challenges regarding the requirements imposed on training data, the\ncomplexity of modeled functions, the ML algorithms employed - and how they are\napplied - the benchmarks used by researchers, and replicability of the studies.\nWe hope that our findings will serve as a roadmap and inspiration for\nresearchers in this field.",

    "title": "Learned Token Pruning for Transformers",
    "abstract": "A major challenge in deploying transformer models is their prohibitive\ninference cost, which quadratically scales with the input sequence length. This\nmakes it especially difficult to use transformers for processing long\nsequences. To address this, we present a novel Learned Token Pruning (LTP)\nmethod that reduces redundant tokens as the data passes through the different\nlayers of the transformer. In particular, LTP prunes tokens with an attention\nscore below a threshold value, which is learned during training. Importantly,\nour threshold based method avoids algorithmically expensive operations such as\ntop-k token selection which are used in prior token pruning methods, and also\nleads to structured pruning. We extensively test the performance of our\napproach on multiple GLUE tasks and show that our learned threshold based\nmethod consistently outperforms the prior state-of-the-art top-k token based\nmethod by up to ~2% higher accuracy with the same amount of FLOPs. Furthermore,\nour preliminary results show up to 1.4x and 1.9x throughput improvement on\nTesla T4 GPU and Intel Haswell CPU, respectively, with less than 1% of accuracy\ndrop (and up to 2.1x FLOPs reduction). Our code has been developed in PyTorch\nand has been open-sourced.",

    "abstract": "Privacy preservation in distributed computations is an important subject as\ndigitization and new technologies enable collection and storage of vast amounts\nof data, including private data belonging to individuals. To this end, there is\na need for a privacy preserving computation framework that minimises the leak\nof private information during computations while being efficient enough for\npractical usage. This paper presents a step towards such a framework with the\nproposal of a real number secret sharing scheme that works directly on real\nnumbers without the need for conversion to integers which is the case in\nrelated schemes. The scheme offers computations like addition, multiplication,\nand division to be performed directly on secret shared data (the cipher text\nversion of the data). Simulations show that the scheme is much more efficient\nin terms of accuracy than its counterpart version based on integers and finite\nfield arithmetic. The drawback with the proposed scheme is that it is not\nperfectly secure. However, we provide a privacy analysis of the scheme, where\nwe show that the leaked information can be upper bounded and asymptotically\ngoes to zero. To demonstrate the scheme, we use it to perform Kalman filtering\ndirectly on secret shared data.",

    "abstract": "Although safety stock optimisation has been studied for more than 60 years,\nmost companies still use simplistic means to calculate necessary safety stock\nlevels, partly due to the mismatch between existing analytical methods'\nemphases on deriving provably optimal solutions and companies' preferences to\nsacrifice optimal results in favour of more realistic problem settings. A newly\nemerging method from the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), namely\nReinforcement Learning (RL), offers promise in finding optimal solutions while\naccommodating more realistic problem features. Unlike analytical-based models,\nRL treats the problem as a black-box simulation environment mitigating against\nthe problem of oversimplifying reality. As such, assumptions on stock keeping\npolicy can be relaxed and a higher number of problem variables can be\naccommodated. While RL has been popular in other domains, its applications in\nsafety stock optimisation remain scarce. In this paper, we investigate three RL\nmethods, namely, Q-Learning, Temporal Difference Advantage Actor-Critic and\nMulti-agent Temporal Difference Advantage Actor-Critic for optimising safety\nstock in a linear chain of independent agents. We find that RL can\nsimultaneously optimise both safety stock level and order quantity parameters\nof an inventory policy, unlike classical safety stock optimisation models where\nonly safety stock level is optimised while order quantity is predetermined\nbased on simple rules. This allows RL to model more complex supply chain\nprocurement behaviour. However, RL takes longer time to arrive at solutions,\nnecessitating future research on identifying and improving trade-offs between\nthe use of AI and mathematical models are needed.",

    "abstract": "Weak supervision learning on classification labels has demonstrated high\nperformance in various tasks. When a few pixel-level fine annotations are also\naffordable, it is natural to leverage both of the pixel-level (e.g.,\nsegmentation) and image level (e.g., classification) annotation to further\nimprove the performance. In computational pathology, however, such weak or\nmixed supervision learning is still a challenging task, since the high\nresolution of whole slide images makes it unattainable to perform end-to-end\ntraining of classification models. An alternative approach is to analyze such\ndata by patch-base model training, i.e., using self-supervised learning to\ngenerate pixel-level pseudo labels for patches. However, such methods usually\nhave model drifting issues, i.e., hard to converge, because the noise\naccumulates during the self-training process. To handle those problems, we\npropose a mixed supervision learning framework for super high-resolution images\nto effectively utilize their various labels (e.g., sufficient image-level\ncoarse annotations and a few pixel-level fine labels). During the patch\ntraining stage, this framework can make use of coarse image-level labels to\nrefine self-supervised learning and generate high-quality pixel-level pseudo\nlabels. A comprehensive strategy is proposed to suppress pixel-level false\npositives and false negatives. Three real-world datasets with very large number\nof images (i.e., more than 10,000 whole slide images) and various types of\nlabels are used to evaluate the effectiveness of mixed supervision learning. We\nreduced the false positive rate by around one third compared to state of the\nart while retaining 100\\% sensitivity, in the task of image-level\nclassification.",

    "abstract": "Metro origin-destination prediction is a crucial yet challenging task for\nintelligent transportation management, which aims to accurately forecast two\nspecific types of cross-station ridership, i.e., Origin-Destination (OD) one\nand Destination-Origin (DO) one. However, complete OD matrices of previous time\nintervals can not be obtained immediately in online metro systems, and\nconventional methods only used limited information to forecast the future OD\nand DO ridership separately.In this work, we proposed a novel neural network\nmodule termed Heterogeneous Information Aggregation Machine (HIAM), which fully\nexploits heterogeneous information of historical data (e.g., incomplete OD\nmatrices, unfinished order vectors, and DO matrices) to jointly learn the\nevolutionary patterns of OD and DO ridership. Specifically, an OD modeling\nbranch estimates the potential destinations of unfinished orders explicitly to\ncomplement the information of incomplete OD matrices, while a DO modeling\nbranch takes DO matrices as input to capture the spatial-temporal distribution\nof DO ridership. Moreover, a Dual Information Transformer is introduced to\npropagate the mutual information among OD features and DO features for modeling\nthe OD-DO causality and correlation. Based on the proposed HIAM, we develop a\nunified Seq2Seq network to forecast the future OD and DO ridership\nsimultaneously. Extensive experiments conducted on two large-scale benchmarks\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method for online metro origin-destination\nprediction.",

As the objectives of mobile sensing could be either \\emph{(a)\npersonalized medicine for individuals} or \\emph{(b) public health for\npopulations}, in this work we review the design of these mobile sensing apps,\nand propose to categorize the design of these apps/systems in two paradigms --\n\\emph{(i) Personal Sensing} and \\emph{(ii) Crowd Sensing} paradigms. While both\nsensing paradigms might incorporate with common ubiquitous sensing\ntechnologies, such as wearable sensors, mobility monitoring, mobile data\noffloading, and/or cloud-based data analytics to collect and process sensing\ndata from individuals, we present a novel taxonomy system with two major\ncomponents that can specify and classify apps/systems from aspects of the\nlife-cycle of mHealth Sensing: \\emph{(1) Sensing Task Creation \\&\nParticipation}, \\emph{(2) Health Surveillance \\& Data Collection}, and\n\\emph{(3) Data Analysis \\& Knowledge Discovery}. With respect to different\ngoals of the two paradigms, this work systematically reviews this field, and\nsummarizes the design of typical apps/systems in the view of the configurations\nand interactions between these two components.

    "abstract": "Building embodied autonomous agents capable of participating in social\ninteractions with humans is one of the main challenges in AI. Within the Deep\nReinforcement Learning (DRL) field, this objective motivated multiple works on\nembodied language use. However, current approaches focus on language as a\ncommunication tool in very simplified and non-diverse social situations: the\n\"naturalness\" of language is reduced to the concept of high vocabulary size and\nvariability. In this paper, we argue that aiming towards human-level AI\nrequires a broader set of key social skills: 1) language use in complex and\nvariable social contexts; 2) beyond language, complex embodied communication in\nmultimodal settings within constantly evolving social worlds. We explain how\nconcepts from cognitive sciences could help AI to draw a roadmap towards\nhuman-like intelligence, with a focus on its social dimensions. As a first\nstep, we propose to expand current research to a broader set of core social\nskills. To do this, we present SocialAI, a benchmark to assess the acquisition\nof social skills of DRL agents using multiple grid-world environments featuring\nother (scripted) social agents. We then study the limits of a recent SOTA DRL\napproach when tested on SocialAI and discuss important next steps towards\nproficient social agents.

By leveraging the\nknowledge of the shape of the intruder's trajectory we are able to calculate\nthe interception point. Target tracking is based on image processing by a\nYOLOv3 Tiny convolutional neural network, combined with depth calculation using\na gimbal-mounted ZED Mini stereo camera. We use RGB and depth data from ZED\nMini to extract the 3D position of the target, for which we devise a\nhistogram-of-depth based processing to reduce noise. Obtained 3D measurements\nof target's position are used to calculate the position, the orientation and\nthe size of a figure-eight shaped trajectory, which we approximate using\nlemniscate of Bernoulli. Once the approximation is deemed sufficiently precise,\nmeasured by Hausdorff distance between measurements and the approximation, an\ninterception point is calculated to position the intercepting UAV right on the\npath of the target. The proposed method, which has been significantly improved\nbased on the experience gathered during the MBZIRC competition, has been\nvalidated in simulation and through field experiments. The results confirmed\nthat an efficient visual perception module which extracts information related\nto the motion of the target UAV as a basis for the interception, has been\ndeveloped. The system is able to track and intercept the target which is 30%\nfaster than the interceptor in majority of simulation experiments.

The traditional diagnosis usually\nrelies on manual analysis from microscopic images which is prone to human error\ndue to morphological similarity of different parasitic eggs and abundance of\nimpurities in a sample. Many studies have developed automatic systems for\nparasite egg detection to reduce human workload. However, they work with high\nquality microscopes, which unfortunately remain unaffordable in some rural\nareas. Our work thus exploits a benefit of a low-cost USB microscope. This\ninstrument however provides poor quality of images due to limitation of\nmagnification (10x), causing difficulty in parasite detection and species\nclassification. In this paper, we propose a CNN-based technique using transfer\nlearning strategy to enhance the efficiency of automatic parasite\nclassification in poor-quality microscopic images. The patch-based technique\nwith sliding window is employed to search for location of the eggs. Two\nnetworks, AlexNet and ResNet50, are examined with a trade-off between\narchitecture size and classification performance.

    "abstract": "While the researches on single image super-resolution (SISR), especially\nequipped with deep neural networks (DNNs), have achieved tremendous successes\nrecently, they still suffer from two major limitations. Firstly, the real image\ndegradation is usually unknown and highly variant from one to another, making\nit extremely hard to train a single model to handle the general SISR task.\nSecondly, most of current methods mainly focus on the downsampling process of\nthe degradation, but ignore or underestimate the inevitable noise\ncontamination. For example, the commonly-used independent and identically\ndistributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian noise distribution always largely deviates from\nthe real image noise (e.g., camera sensor noise), which limits their\nperformance in real scenarios. To address these issues, this paper proposes a\nmodel-based unsupervised SISR method to deal with the general SISR task with\nunknown degradations. Instead of the traditional i.i.d. Gaussian noise\nassumption, a novel patch-based non-i.i.d. noise modeling method is proposed to\nfit the complex real noise. Besides, a deep generator parameterized by a DNN is\nused to map the latent variable to the high-resolution image, and the\nconventional hyper-Laplacian prior is also elaborately embedded into such\ngenerator to further constrain the image gradients. Finally, a Monte Carlo EM\nalgorithm is designed to solve our model, which provides a general inference\nframework to update the image generator both w.r.t. the latent variable and the\nnetwork parameters. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod can evidently surpass the current state of the art (SotA) method (about\n1dB PSNR) not only with a slighter model (0.34M vs. 2.40M) but also faster\nspeed.",

    "title": "Optical Braille Recognition using Circular Hough Transform",
    "abstract": "Braille has empowered visually challenged community to read and write. But at\nthe same time, it has created a gap due to widespread inability of non-Braille\nusers to understand Braille scripts. This gap has fuelled researchers to\npropose Optical Braille Recognition techniques to convert Braille documents to\nnatural language. The main motivation of this work is to cement the\ncommunication gap at academic institutions by translating personal documents of\nblind students. This has been accomplished by proposing an economical and\neffective technique which digitizes Braille documents using a smartphone\ncamera. For any given Braille image, a dot detection mechanism based on Hough\ntransform is proposed which is invariant to skewness, noise and other\ndeterrents. The detected dots are then clustered into Braille cells using\ndistance-based clustering algorithm. In succession, the standard physical\nparameters of each Braille cells are estimated for feature extraction and\nclassification as natural language characters. The comprehensive evaluation of\nthis technique on the proposed dataset of 54 Braille scripts has yielded into\naccuracy of 98.71%.",

    "abstract": "This work focuses over the performability analysis of a multi-server retrial\nqueueing model with phase-type inter-retrial times in cellular networks. It is\nconsidered that the pattern of the new call arrival and handoff call arrival\nfollows Markovian arrival process (MAP). The service times of both types of\ncalls are phase-type (PH ) distributed with different service rates, and\ninter-failure & inter-repair times of channels are exponentially distributed.\nFor the prioritization of handoff calls, G channels are kept in reserve for\nhandoff calls. When all the available channels, say S, are busy at the arrival\nepoch of a handoff call, the handoff call will be dropped. Whereas a new call\nwill be blocked and will have an option to join the orbit of infinite capacity\nor leave the system without getting the connection, if at least S-G channels\nare busy. A new call in the orbit, termed as retrial call, retries to get the\nconnection after a random interval which follows PH distribution. This model is\nanalyzed as a level-dependent-quasi-birth-death (LDQBD) process by applying\nmatrix-analytic method (MAM). Further, the closed-form expressions for\nessential performance measures of the proposed model are derived. Through\nnumerical illustrations, the behaviour of performance measures depending on the\nvarious relevant intensities is discussed. An expected cost optimization\nproblem is formulated to determine the optimal value of service intensity and\nthe optimal value of repair intensity. The cost function analysis is executed\nby employing Simulated Annealing (SA) method.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the problem of providing ultra-reliable and\nenergy-efficient virtual reality (VR) experiences for wireless mobile users. To\nensure reliable ultra-high-definition (UHD) video frame delivery to mobile\nusers and enhance their immersive visual experiences, a coordinated multipoint\n(CoMP) transmission technique and millimeter wave (mmWave) communications are\nexploited. Owing to user movement and time-varying wireless channels, the\nwireless VR experience enhancement problem is formulated as a\nsequence-dependent and mixed-integer problem with a goal of maximizing users'\nfeeling of presence (FoP) in the virtual world, subject to power consumption\nconstraints on access points (APs) and users' head-mounted displays (HMDs). The\nproblem, however, is hard to be directly solved due to the lack of users'\naccurate tracking information and the sequence-dependent and mixed-integer\ncharacteristics. To overcome this challenge, we develop a parallel echo state\nnetwork (ESN) learning method to predict users' tracking information by\ntraining fresh and historical tracking samples separately collected by APs.\nWith the learnt results, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based\noptimization algorithm to solve the formulated problem. In this algorithm, we\nimplement deep neural networks (DNNs) as a scalable solution to produce integer\ndecision variables and solving a continuous power control problem to criticize\nthe integer decision variables. Finally, the performance of the proposed\nalgorithm is compared with various benchmark algorithms, and the impact of\ndifferent design parameters is also discussed. Simulation results demonstrate\nthat the proposed algorithm is more 4.14% energy-efficient than the benchmark\nalgorithms.",

    "abstract": "We introduce WiCluster, a new machine learning (ML) approach for passive\nindoor positioning using radio frequency (RF) channel state information (CSI).\nWiCluster can predict both a zone-level position and a precise 2D or 3D\nposition, without using any precise position labels during training. Prior\nCSI-based indoor positioning work has relied on non-parametric approaches using\ndigital signal-processing (DSP) and, more recently, parametric approaches\n(e.g., fully supervised ML methods). However these do not handle the complexity\nof real-world environments well and do not meet requirements for large-scale\ncommercial deployments: the accuracy of DSP-based method deteriorates\nsignificantly in non-line-of-sight conditions, while supervised ML methods need\nlarge amounts of hard-to-acquire centimeter accuracy position labels. In\ncontrast, WiCluster is both precise and requires weaker label-information that\ncan be easily collected. Our first contribution is a novel dimensionality\nreduction method for charting. It combines a triplet-loss with a multi-scale\nclustering-loss to map the high-dimensional CSI representation to a 2D/3D\nlatent space. Our second contribution is two weakly supervised losses that map\nthis latent space into a Cartesian map, resulting in meter-accuracy position\nresults. These losses only require simple to acquire priors: a sketch of the\nfloorplan, approximate location of access-point locations and a few CSI packets\nthat are labeled with the corresponding zone in the floorplan. Thirdly, we\nreport results and a robustness study for 2D positioning in a single-floor\noffice building and 3D positioning in a two-floor home to show the robustness\nof our method.",

Thanks to the high spectral efficiency and low latency,\nnon-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a potential access technique for\nfuture communication networks. In this paper, we propose to use the UAV as a\nmoving base station (BS) to serve multiple users using NOMA and jointly solve\nfor the 3D-UAV placement and resource allocation problem. Since the\ncorresponding optimization problem is non-convex, we rely on the recent\nadvances in artificial intelligence (AI) and propose AdaptSky, a deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL)-based framework, to efficiently solve it. To the\nbest of our knowledge, AdaptSky is the first framework that optimizes NOMA\npower allocation jointly with 3D-UAV placement using both sub-6GHz and\nmillimeter wave mmWave spectrum. Furthermore, for the first time in NOMA-UAV\nnetworks, AdaptSky integrates the dueling network (DN) architecture to the DRL\ntechnique to improve its learning capabilities.

    "abstract": "Regulatory radio spectrum management is evolving from traditional static\nfrequency allocation and assignment schemes towards dynamic spectrum management\nand access schemes. This evolution is necessitated by a number of factors\nincluding underutilization of licensed spectrum bands, changing market and\ntechnological developments and increased demand for spectrum for emerging\napplications in multimedia communications, internet-of-things and fifth\ngeneration (5G) wireless networks. In simple terms dynamic spectrum management\ninvolves allowing unlicensed users known as secondary users (SUs) to access the\nlicensed spectrum of a licensed user also known as primary user (PU). This is\nprimarily achieved using spectrum sharing schemes that leverage spectrum\ndatabase and cognitive radio techniques. However, the use of spectrum database\nand cognitive radio techniques faces reliability, security and privacy concerns\nfor spectrum sharing. There is also a need to support other requirements of\ndynamic spectrum management such as secondary spectrum trading market and\ndynamic spectrum access coordination. In this work, we review the use of\nblockchains for enabling spectrum sharing and other aspects of dynamic spectrum\nmanagement. The review covers the use of blockchain to record spectrum\nmanagement information such as spectrum sensing results and spectrum auction\ntransactions in a secure manner. The article also covers the use of smart\ncontracts to support complex service-levelagreements (SLAs) between network\noperators which is key to supporting a self-organized secondary spectrum\nsharing market and enforcement of regulatory policies.

    "abstract": "Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) refers to the concept of placing computational\ncapability and applications at the edge of the network, providing benefits such\nas reduced latency in handling client requests, reduced network congestion, and\nimproved performance of applications. The performance and reliability of MEC\nare degraded significantly when one or several edge servers in the cluster are\noverloaded. Especially when a server crashes due to the overload, it causes\nservice failures in MEC. In this work, an adaptive admission control policy to\nprevent edge node from getting overloaded is presented. This approach is based\non a recently-proposed low complexity RL (Reinforcement Learning) algorithm\ncalled SALMUT (Structure-Aware Learning for Multiple Thresholds), which\nexploits the structure of the optimal admission control policy in multi-class\nqueues for an average-cost setting. We extend the framework to work for node\noverload-protection problem in a discounted-cost setting. The proposed solution\nis validated using several scenarios mimicking real-world deployments in two\ndifferent settings - computer simulations and a docker testbed. Our empirical\nevaluations show that the total discounted cost incurred by SALMUT is similar\nto state-of-the-art deep RL algorithms such as PPO (Proximal Policy\nOptimization) and A2C (Advantage Actor Critic) but requires an order of\nmagnitude less time to train, outputs easily interpretable policy, and can be\ndeployed in an online manner.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Everything (IoE) is a recently introduced information and\ncommunication technology (ICT) framework promising for extending the human\nconnectivity to the entire universe, which itself can be regarded as a natural\nIoE, an interconnected network of everything we perceive. The countless number\nof opportunities that can be enabled by IoE through a blend of heterogeneous\nICT technologies across different scales and environments and a seamless\ninterface with the natural IoE impose several fundamental challenges, such as\ninteroperability, ubiquitous connectivity, energy efficiency, and\nminiaturization. The key to address these challenges is to advance our\ncommunication technology to match the multi-scale, multi-modal, and dynamic\nfeatures of the natural IoE. To this end, we introduce a new communication\ndevice concept, namely the universal IoE transceiver, that encompasses\ntransceiver architectures that are characterized by multi-modality in\ncommunication (with modalities such as molecular, RF/THz, optical and acoustic)\nand in energy harvesting (with modalities such as mechanical, solar,\nbiochemical), modularity, tunability, and scalability. Focusing on these\nfundamental traits, we provide an overview of the opportunities that can be\nopened up by micro/nanoscale universal transceiver architectures towards\nrealizing the IoE applications. We also discuss the most pressing challenges in\nimplementing such transceivers and briefly review the open research directions.\nOur discussion is particularly focused on the opportunities and challenges\npertaining to the IoE physical layer, which can enable the efficient and\neffective design of higher-level techniques. We believe that such universal\ntransceivers can pave the way for seamless connection and communication with\nthe universe at a deeper level and pioneer the construction of the forthcoming\nIoE landscape.",

    "abstract": "The energy demand is growing daily at an accelerated pace due to the\ninternationalization and development of civilization. Yet proper economic\nutilization of additional energy generated by the Islanded Hybrid Microgrid\nSystem (IHMS) that was not consumed by the load is a major global challenge. To\nresolve the above-stated summons, this research focuses on a multi-optimal\ncombination of IHMS for the Penang Hill Resort located on Penang Island,\nMalaysia, with effective use of redundant energy. To avail this excess energy\nefficiently, an electrical heater along with a storage tank has been designed\nconcerning diversion load having proper energy management. Furthermore, the\nsystem design has adopted the HOMER Pro software for profitable and practical\nanalysis. Alongside, MATLAB Simulink had stabilized the whole system by\nrepresenting the values of 2068 and 19,072 kW that have been determined as the\napproximated peak and average load per day for the resort. Moreover, the\noptimized IHMS is comprehended of Photovoltaic (PV) cells, Diesel Generator,\nWind Turbine, Battery, and Converter. Adjacent to this, the optimized system\nensued in having a Net Present Cost (NPC) of $21.66 million, Renewable Fraction\n(RF) of 27.8%, Cost of Energy (COE) of $0.165/kWh, CO2 of 1,735,836 kg/year,\nand excess energy of 517.29MWh per annum. Since the diesel generator lead\nsystem was included in the scheme, a COE of $0.217/kWh, CO2 of 5,124,879\nkg/year, and NPC of $23.25 million were attained. The amount of excess energy\nis effectively utilized with an electrical heater as a diversion load.",

    "abstract": "The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change proposes different mitigation\nstrategies to achieve the net emissions reductions that would be required to\nfollow a pathway that limits global warming to 1.5{\\deg}C with no or limited\novershoot. The transition towards a carbon-free society goes through an\ninevitable increase of the share of renewable generation in the energy mix and\na drastic decrease in terms of the total consumption of fossil fuels.\nTherefore, this thesis studies the integration of renewables in power systems\nby investigating forecasting and decision-making tools. Indeed, in contrast to\nconventional power plants, renewable energy is subject to uncertainty. Most of\nthe generation technologies based on renewable sources are non-dispatchable,\nand their production is stochastic and hard to predict in advance. A high share\nof renewables is a great challenge for power systems that have been designed\nand sized for dispatchable units. In this context, probabilistic forecasts,\nwhich aim at modeling the distribution of all possible future realizations,\nhave become an important tool to equip decision-makers, hopefully leading to\nbetter decisions in energy applications. This thesis focus on two main research\nquestions: (1) How to produce reliable probabilistic forecasts of renewable\ngeneration, consumption, and electricity prices? (2) How to make decisions with\nuncertainty using probabilistic forecasts? The thesis perimeter is the energy\nmanagement of \"small\" systems such as microgrids at a residential scale on a\nday-ahead basis. It is divided into two main parts to propose directions to\naddress both research questions (1) a forecasting part; (2) a planning and\ncontrol part.",

In this paper, we assay a complementary\nperspective originating from the increasing availability of pre-trained and\nregularly improving state-of-the-art models. While new improved models develop\nat a fast pace, downstream tasks vary more slowly or stay constant. Assume that\nwe have a large unlabelled data set for which we want to maintain accurate\npredictions. Whenever a new and presumably better ML models becomes available,\nwe encounter two problems: (i) given a limited budget, which data points should\nbe re-evaluated using the new model?; and (ii) if the new predictions differ\nfrom the current ones, should we update? Problem (i) is about compute cost,\nwhich matters for very large data sets and models. Problem (ii) is about\nmaintaining consistency of the predictions, which can be highly relevant for\ndownstream applications; our demand is to avoid negative flips, i.e., changing\ncorrect to incorrect predictions. In this paper, we formalize the Prediction\nUpdate Problem and present an efficient probabilistic approach as answer to the\nabove questions.

The physical model is based on two-phase Darcy\nflows coupling the mass conservation of the water component with the energy\nconservation and the liquid vapor thermodynamical equilibrium. The\ndiscretization exploits the flexibility of unstructured meshes to model complex\ngeology including conductive faults as well as complex wells. The polytopal and\nessentially nodal Vertex Approximate Gradient scheme is used for the\napproximation of the Darcy and Fourier fluxes combined with a Control Volume\napproach for the transport of mass and energy. Particular attention is paid to\nthe faults which are modelled as two-dimensional interfaces defined as\ncollection of faces of the mesh and to the flow inside deviated or multi-branch\nwells defined as collection of edges of the mesh with rooted tree data\nstructure. By using an explicit pressure drop calculation, the well model\nreduces to a single equation based on complementarity constraints with only one\nwell implicit unknown. The coupled systems are solved fully implicitely at each\ntime step using efficient nonlinear and linear solvers on parallel distributed\narchitectures. The convergence of the discrete model is investigated\nnumerically on a simple test case with a Cartesian geometry and a single\nvertical producer well. Then, the ability of our approach to deal efficiently\nwith realistic test cases is assessed on a high energy faulted geothermal\nreservoir operated using a doublet of two deviated wells.",

    "abstract": "The classification of histopathological images is of great value in both\ncancer diagnosis and pathological studies. However, multiple reasons, such as\nvariations caused by magnification factors and class imbalance, make it a\nchallenging task where conventional methods that learn from image-label\ndatasets perform unsatisfactorily in many cases. We observe that tumours of the\nsame class often share common morphological patterns. To exploit this fact, we\npropose an approach that learns similarity-based multi-scale embeddings (SMSE)\nfor magnification-independent histopathological image classification. In\nparticular, a pair loss and a triplet loss are leveraged to learn\nsimilarity-based embeddings from image pairs or image triplets. The learned\nembeddings provide accurate measurements of similarities between images, which\nare regarded as a more effective form of representation for histopathological\nmorphology than normal image features. Furthermore, in order to ensure the\ngenerated models are magnification-independent, images acquired at different\nmagnification factors are simultaneously fed to networks during training for\nlearning multi-scale embeddings. In addition to the SMSE, to eliminate the\nimpact of class imbalance, instead of using the hard sample mining strategy\nthat intuitively discards some easy samples, we introduce a new reinforced\nfocal loss to simultaneously punish hard misclassified samples while\nsuppressing easy well-classified samples. Experimental results show that the\nSMSE improves the performance for histopathological image classification tasks\nfor both breast and liver cancers by a large margin compared to previous\nmethods. In particular, the SMSE achieves the best performance on the BreakHis\nbenchmark with an improvement ranging from 5% to 18% compared to previous\nmethods using traditional features.",

Building a SUC system requires a\nlarge amount of supervised in-domain data that is not always available. In this\npaper, we introduce an unsupervised spoken utterance classification approach\n(USUC) that does not require any in-domain data except for the intent labels\nand a few para-phrases per intent. USUC is consisting of a KNN classifier (K=1)\nand a complex embedding model trained on a large amount of unsupervised\ncustomer service corpus. Among all embedding models, we demonstrate that Elmo\nworks best for USUC. However, an Elmo model is too slow to be used at run-time\nfor call routing. To resolve this issue, first, we compute the uni- and bi-gram\nembedding vectors offline and we build a lookup table of n-grams and their\ncorresponding embedding vector. Then we use this table to compute sentence\nembedding vectors at run-time, along with back-off techniques for unseen\nn-grams. Experiments show that USUC outperforms the traditional utterance\nclassification methods by reducing the classification error rate from 32.9% to\n27.0% without requiring supervised data.

To this end, we propose two metrics: the first one,\ncalled layer complexity, captures the architectural complexity of any network\nlayer; and, the second one, called layer intrinsic power, encodes how data is\ncompressed along the network. The metrics are based on the concept of layer\nalgebra, which is also introduced in this paper. This concept is based on the\nidea that the global properties depend on the network topology, and the leaf\nnodes of any neural network can be approximated using local transfer functions,\nthereby, allowing a simple computation of the global metrics. We also compare\nthe properties of the state-of-the art architectures using our metrics and use\nthe properties to analyze the classification accuracy on benchmark datasets.",

    "abstract": "Infant motility assessment using intelligent wearables is a promising new\napproach for assessment of infant neurophysiological development, and where\nefficient signal analysis plays a central role. This study investigates the use\nof different end-to-end neural network architectures for processing infant\nmotility data from wearable sensors. We focus on the performance and\ncomputational burden of alternative sensor encoder and time-series modelling\nmodules and their combinations. In addition, we explore the benefits of data\naugmentation methods in ideal and non-ideal recording conditions. The\nexperiments are conducted using a data-set of multi-sensor movement recordings\nfrom 7-month-old infants, as captured by a recently proposed smart jumpsuit for\ninfant motility assessment. Our results indicate that the choice of the encoder\nmodule has a major impact on classifier performance. For sensor encoders, the\nbest performance was obtained with parallel 2-dimensional convolutions for\nintra-sensor channel fusion with shared weights for all sensors. The results\nalso indicate that a relatively compact feature representation is obtainable\nfor within-sensor feature extraction without a drastic loss to classifier\nperformance. Comparison of time-series models revealed that feed-forward\ndilated convolutions with residual and skip connections outperformed all\nRNN-based models in performance, training time, and training stability. The\nexperiments also indicate that data augmentation improves model robustness in\nsimulated packet loss or sensor dropout scenarios. In particular, signal- and\nsensor-dropout-based augmentation strategies provided considerable boosts to\nperformance without negatively affecting the baseline performance. Overall the\nresults provide tangible suggestions on how to optimize end-to-end neural\nnetwork training for multi-channel movement sensor data.",

Crowdsourcing has become one of\nthe standard tools for cheap and time-efficient data collection for simple\nproblems such as image classification: thanks in large part to advances in\nresearch on aggregation methods. However, the applicability of crowdsourcing to\nmore complex tasks (e.g., speech recognition) remains limited due to the lack\nof principled aggregation methods for these modalities.

However, there exist only a few attempts with limited success\nto cope with the complexity of C++ program verification. Here we describe and\nevaluate a novel verification approach based on bounded model checking (BMC)\nand satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) to verify C++ programs formally. Our\nverification approach analyzes bounded C++ programs by encoding into SMT\nvarious sophisticated features that the C++ programming language offers, such\nas templates, inheritance, polymorphism, exception handling, and the Standard\nC++ Libraries. We formalize these features within our formal verification\nframework using a decidable fragment of first-order logic and then show how\nstate-of-the-art SMT solvers can efficiently handle that. We implemented our\nverification approach on top of ESBMC. We compare ESBMC to LLBMC and DIVINE,\nwhich are state-of-the-art verifiers to check C++ programs directly from the\nLLVM bitcode. Experimental results show that ESBMC can handle a wide range of\nC++ programs, presenting a higher number of correct verification results. At\nthe same time, it reduces the verification time if compared to LLBMC and DIVINE\ntools.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an operational measure of non-stochastic information\nleakage to formalize privacy against a brute-force guessing adversary. The\ninformation is measured by non-probabilistic uncertainty of uncertain\nvariables, the non-stochastic counterparts of random variables. For $X$ that is\nrelated to released data $Y$, the non-stochastic brute-force leakage is\nmeasured by the complexity of exhaustively checking all the possibilities of\nthe private attribute $U$ of $X$ by an adversary. The complexity refers to the\nnumber of trials to successfully guess $U$. Maximizing this leakage over all\npossible private attributes $U$ gives rise to the maximal (i.e., worst-case)\nnon-stochastic brute-force guessing leakage. This is proved to be fully\ndetermined by the minimal non-stochastic uncertainty of $X$ given $Y$, which\nalso determines the worst-case attribute $U$ indicating the highest privacy\nrisk if $Y$ is disclosed. The maximal non-stochastic brute-force guessing\nleakage is shown to be proportional to the non-stochastic identifiability of\n$X$ given $Y$ and upper bounds the existing maximin information. The latter\nquantifies the information leakage when an adversary must perfectly guess $U$\nin one-shot via $Y$. Experiments are used to demonstrate the tradeoff between\nthe maximal non-stochastic brute-force guessing leakage and the data utility\n(measured by the maximum quantization error) and to illustrate the relationship\nbetween maximin information and stochastic one-shot maximal leakage.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates requirements on a networked dynamic system (NDS) such\nthat its subsystem interactions can be solely determined from experiment data\nor reconstructed from its overall model. The NDS is constituted from several\nsubsystems whose dynamics are described through a descriptor form. Except\nregularity on each subsystem and the whole NDS, no other restrictions are put\non either subsystem dynamics or subsystem interactions. A matrix rank based\nnecessary and sufficient condition is derived for the global identifiability of\nsubsystem interactions, which leads to several conclusions about NDS structure\nidentifiability when there is some a priori information. This matrix also gives\nan explicit description for the set of subsystem interactions that can not be\ndistinguished from experiment data only. In addition, under a well-posedness\nassumption, a necessary and sufficient condition is obtained for the\nreconstructibility of subsystem interactions from an NDS descriptor form model.\nThis condition can be verified with each subsystem separately and is therefore\nattractive in the analysis and synthesis of a large-scale NDS. Simulation\nresults show that rather than increases monotonically with the distance of\nsubsystem interactions to the undifferentiable set, the magnitude of the\nexternal output differences between two NDSs with distinct subsystem\ninteractions increases much more rapidly when one of them is close to be\nunstable. In addition, directions of probing signals are also very important in\ndistinguishing external outputs of distinctive NDSs.These findings are expected\nto be helpful in identification experiment designs, etc.",

The main computational challenges for such problems include\ndiscontinuities of the solutions and the curse of dimensionality due to\nuncertainties. Deep learning techniques have been favored for high-dimensional\nproblems but face difficulties when the solution is not smooth, thus have so\nfar been mainly used for viscous hyperbolic system that admits only smooth\nsolutions. We alleviate this difficulty by setting up the loss function using\ndiscrete shock capturing schemes--the discontinous Galerkin method as an\nexample--since the solutions are smooth in the discrete space. The convergence\nof D2GM is established via the Lax equivalence theorem kind of argument. The\nhigh-dimensional random space is handled by the Monte-Carlo method. Such a\nsetup makes the D2GM approximate high-dimensional functions over the random\nspace with satisfactory accuracy at reasonable cost. The D2GM is found\nnumerically to be first-order and second-order accurate for (stochastic) linear\nconservation law with smooth solutions using piecewise constant and piecewise\nlinear basis functions, respectively.

To this end, many different methods are proposed in the last decade\nwith promising results in various applications. The success of a DML algorithm\ngreatly depends on its loss function. However, no loss function is perfect, and\nit deals only with some aspects of an optimal similarity embedding.

    "title": "Gradient-Leakage Resilient Federated Learning",
    "abstract": "Federated learning(FL) is an emerging distributed learning paradigm with\ndefault client privacy because clients can keep sensitive data on their devices\nand only share local training parameter updates with the federated server.\nHowever, recent studies reveal that gradient leakages in FL may compromise the\nprivacy of client training data. This paper presents a gradient leakage\nresilient approach to privacy-preserving federated learning with per training\nexample-based client differential privacy, coined as Fed-CDP. It makes three\noriginal contributions. First, we identify three types of client gradient\nleakage threats in federated learning even with encrypted client-server\ncommunications. We articulate when and why the conventional server coordinated\ndifferential privacy approach, coined as Fed-SDP, is insufficient to protect\nthe privacy of the training data. Second, we introduce Fed-CDP, the per\nexample-based client differential privacy algorithm, and provide a formal\nanalysis of Fed-CDP with the $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$ differential privacy\nguarantee, and a formal comparison between Fed-CDP and Fed-SDP in terms of\nprivacy accounting. Third, we formally analyze the privacy-utility trade-off\nfor providing differential privacy guarantee by Fed-CDP and present a dynamic\ndecay noise-injection policy to further improve the accuracy and resiliency of\nFed-CDP. We evaluate and compare Fed-CDP and Fed-CDP(decay) with Fed-SDP in\nterms of differential privacy guarantee and gradient leakage resilience over\nfive benchmark datasets. The results show that the Fed-CDP approach outperforms\nconventional Fed-SDP in terms of resilience to client gradient leakages while\noffering competitive accuracy performance in federated learning.",

    "abstract": "Adversarial computations are a widely studied class of computations where\nresource-bounded probabilistic adversaries have access to oracles, i.e.,\nprobabilistic procedures with private state. These computations arise routinely\nin several domains, including security, privacy and machine learning. In this\npaper, we develop program logics for reasoning about adversarial computations\nin a higher-order setting. Our logics are built on top of a simply typed\n$\\lambda$-calculus extended with a graded monad for probabilities and state.\nThe grading is used to model and restrict the memory footprint and the cost (in\nterms of oracle calls) of computations. Under this view, an adversary is a\nhigher-order expression that expects as arguments the code of its oracles. We\ndevelop unary program logics for reasoning about error probabilities and\nexpected values, and a relational logic for reasoning about coupling-based\nproperties. All logics feature rules for adversarial computations, and yield\nguarantees that are valid for all adversaries that satisfy a fixed resource\npolicy. We prove the soundness of the logics in the category of quasi-Borel\nspaces, using a general notion of graded predicate liftings, and we use logical\nrelations over graded predicate liftings to establish the soundness of proof\nrules for adversaries. We illustrate the working of our logics with simple but\nillustrative examples.",

    "abstract": "Today's ride-hailing systems experienced significant growth and ride-pooling\npromises to allow for efficient and sustainable on-demand transportation.\nHowever, efficient ride-pooling requires a large pool of participating\ncustomers. To increase the customers' willingness for participation, we study a\nnovel customer-centered pooling (CCP) mechanism, accounting for individual\ncustomers' pooling benefits. We study the benefit of this mechanism from a\ncustomer, fleet operator, and system perspective, and compare it to existing\nprovider-centered pooling (PCP) mechanisms. We prove that it is individually\nrational and weakly dominant for a customer to participate in CCP, but not for\nPCP. We substantiate this analysis with complementary numerical studies,\nimplementing a simulation environment based on real-world data that allows us\nto assess both mechanisms' benefit. To this end, we present results for both\npooling mechanisms and show that pooling can benefit all stakeholders in\non-demand transportation. Moreover, we analyze in which cases a CCP mechanism\nPareto dominates a PCP mechanism and show that a mobility service operator\nwould prefer CCP mechanisms over PCP mechanisms for all price segments.\nSimultaneously, CCP mechanisms reduce the overall distance driven in the system\nup to 32% compared to not pooling customers. Our results provide decision\nsupport for mobility service operators that want to implement and improve\npooling mechanisms as they allow us to analyze the impact of a CCP and a PCP\nmechanism from a holistic perspective. Among others, we show that CCP\nmechanisms can lead to a win-win situation for operators and customers while\nsimultaneously improving system performance and reducing emissions.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study stochastic optimization of areas under\nprecision-recall curves (AUPRC), which is widely used for combating imbalanced\nclassification tasks. Although a few methods have been proposed for maximizing\nAUPRC, stochastic optimization of AUPRC with convergence guarantee remains an\nundeveloped territory. A recent work [42] has proposed a promising approach\ntowards AUPRC based on maximizing a surrogate loss for the average precision,\nand proved an $O(1/\\epsilon^5)$ complexity for finding an $\\epsilon$-stationary\nsolution of the non-convex objective. In this paper, we further improve the\nstochastic optimization of AURPC by (i) developing novel stochastic momentum\nmethods with a better iteration complexity of $O(1/\\epsilon^4)$ for finding an\n$\\epsilon$-stationary solution; and (ii) designing a novel family of stochastic\nadaptive methods with the same iteration complexity of $O(1/\\epsilon^4)$, which\nenjoy faster convergence in practice. To this end, we propose two innovative\ntechniques that are critical for improving the convergence: (i) the biased\nestimators for tracking individual ranking scores are updated in a randomized\ncoordinate-wise manner; and (ii) a momentum update is used on top of the\nstochastic gradient estimator for tracking the gradient of the objective.\nExtensive experiments on various data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed algorithms. Of independent interest, the proposed stochastic momentum\nand adaptive algorithms are also applicable to a class of two-level stochastic\ndependent compositional optimization problems.",

Experiment results show that our method plays an\nessential role in balancing inter and intra variances and brings consistent\nperformance gains on multiple backbones and contrastive learning frameworks.\nIntegrated with SimCLR and pretrained on Kinetics-400, our method achieves\n$\\textbf{82.0\\%}$ and $\\textbf{51.2\\%}$ downstream classification accuracy on\nUCF101 and HMDB51 test sets respectively and $\\textbf{46.1\\%}$ video retrieval\naccuracy on UCF101, outperforming both pretext-task based and contrastive\nlearning based counterparts.",

    "abstract": "Existing frameworks for transfer learning are incomplete from a systems\ntheoretic perspective. They place emphasis on notions of domain and task, and\nneglect notions of structure and behavior. In doing so, they limit the extent\nto which formalism can be carried through into the elaboration of their\nframeworks. Herein, we use Mesarovician systems theory to define transfer\nlearning as a relation on sets and subsequently characterize the general nature\nof transfer learning as a mathematical construct. We interpret existing\nframeworks in terms of ours and go beyond existing frameworks to define notions\nof transferability, transfer roughness, and transfer distance. Importantly,\ndespite its formalism, our framework avoids the detailed mathematics of\nlearning theory or machine learning solution methods without excluding their\nconsideration. As such, we provide a formal, general systems framework for\nmodeling transfer learning that offers a rigorous foundation for system design\nand analysis.",

Snake robots are ideal for traversing through constrained\nenvironments such as pipes, cluttered and rough terrain, whereas bipedal robots\nare more suited for structured environments such as stairs. Finally, quadruped\nrobots are more stable than bipeds and can carry larger payloads than snakes\nand bipeds but struggle to navigate soft soil, sand, ice, and constrained\nenvironments. A reconfigurable robot can achieve the best of all worlds.\nUnfortunately, state-of-the-art reconfigurable robots rely on the rearrangement\nof modules through complicated mechanisms to dissemble and assemble at\ndifferent places, increasing the size, weight, and power (SWaP) requirements.\nWe propose Reconfigurable Quadrupedal-Bipedal Snake Robots (ReQuBiS), which can\ntransform between mobility modes without rearranging modules. Hence, requiring\njust a single modification mechanism. Furthermore, our design allows the robot\nto split into two agents to perform tasks in parallel for biped and snake\nmobility.

    "abstract": "3D hand shape and pose estimation from a single depth map is a new and\nchallenging computer vision problem with many applications. Existing methods\naddressing it directly regress hand meshes via 2D convolutional neural\nnetworks, which leads to artifacts due to perspective distortions in the\nimages. To address the limitations of the existing methods, we develop\nHandVoxNet++, i.e., a voxel-based deep network with 3D and graph convolutions\ntrained in a fully supervised manner. The input to our network is a 3D\nvoxelized-depth-map-based on the truncated signed distance function (TSDF).\nHandVoxNet++ relies on two hand shape representations. The first one is the 3D\nvoxelized grid of hand shape, which does not preserve the mesh topology and\nwhich is the most accurate representation. The second representation is the\nhand surface that preserves the mesh topology. We combine the advantages of\nboth representations by aligning the hand surface to the voxelized hand shape\neither with a new neural Graph-Convolutions-based Mesh Registration\n(GCN-MeshReg) or classical segment-wise Non-Rigid Gravitational Approach\n(NRGA++) which does not rely on training data. In extensive evaluations on\nthree public benchmarks, i.e., SynHand5M, depth-based HANDS19 challenge and\nHO-3D, the proposed HandVoxNet++ achieves the state-of-the-art performance. In\nthis journal extension of our previous approach presented at CVPR 2020, we gain\n41.09% and 13.7% higher shape alignment accuracy on SynHand5M and HANDS19\ndatasets, respectively.

However, extracting IBIs from noisy signals is\nchallenging since the morphology of the signal is distorted in the presence of\nthe noise. Electrocardiogram (ECG) of a person in heavy motion is highly\ncorrupted with noise, known as motion-artifact, and IBI extracted from it is\ninaccurate. As a part of remote health monitoring and wearable system\ndevelopment, denoising ECG signals and estimating IBIs correctly from them have\nbecome an emerging topic among signal-processing researchers. Apart from\nconventional methods, deep-learning techniques have been successfully used in\nsignal denoising recently, and diagnosis process has become easier, leading to\naccuracy levels that were previously unachievable. We propose a deep-learning\napproach leveraging tiramisu autoencoder model to suppress motion-artifact\nnoise and make the R-peaks of the ECG signal prominent even in the presence of\nhigh-intensity motion. After denoising, IBIs are estimated more accurately\nexpediting diagnosis tasks. Results illustrate that our method enables IBI\nestimation from noisy ECG signals with SNR up to -30dB with average root mean\nsquare error (RMSE) of 13 milliseconds for estimated IBIs.

Existing methods for (relative) density-ratio\nestimation (DRE) require many instances from both densities. However,\nsufficient instances are often unavailable in practice. In this paper, we\npropose a meta-learning method for relative DRE, which estimates the relative\ndensity-ratio from a few instances by using knowledge in related datasets.\nSpecifically, given two datasets that consist of a few instances, our model\nextracts the datasets' information by using neural networks and uses it to\nobtain instance embeddings appropriate for the relative DRE. We model the\nrelative density-ratio by a linear model on the embedded space, whose global\noptimum solution can be obtained as a closed-form solution. The closed-form\nsolution enables fast and effective adaptation to a few instances, and its\ndifferentiability enables us to train our model such that the expected test\nerror for relative DRE can be explicitly minimized after adapting to a few\ninstances.

However, we note\nthat existing environments for studying causal induction are poorly suited for\nthis objective because they have complicated task-specific causal graphs which\nare impossible to manipulate parametrically (e.g., number of nodes, sparsity,\ncausal chain length, etc.). In this work, our goal is to facilitate research in\nlearning representations of high-level variables as well as causal structures\namong them. In order to systematically probe the ability of methods to identify\nthese variables and structures, we design a suite of benchmarking RL\nenvironments. We evaluate various representation learning algorithms from the\nliterature and find that explicitly incorporating structure and modularity in\nmodels can help causal induction in model-based reinforcement learning.",

First, we prove that the popular sequential\nimportance sampling algorithm works in polynomial time for dense bipartite\ngraphs. More carefully, our algorithm gives a $(1-\\epsilon)$-approximation for\nthe number of perfect matchings of a $\\lambda$-dense bipartite graph, using\n$O(n^{\\frac{1-2\\lambda}{8\\lambda}+\\epsilon^{-2}})$ samples. With size $n$ on\neach side and for $\\frac{1}{2}>\\lambda>0$, a $\\lambda$-dense bipartite graph\nhas all degrees greater than $(\\lambda+\\frac{1}{2})n$.\nSecond, practical applications of the algorithm requires many calls to\nmatching algorithms. A novel preprocessing step is provided which makes\nsignificant improvements.\nThird, three applications are provided. The first is for counting Latin\nsquares, the second is a practical way of computing the greedy algorithm for a\ncard guessing game with feedback, and the third is for stochastic block models.\nIn all three examples, sequential importance sampling allows treating practical\nproblems of reasonably large sizes.",

    "abstract": "Meta learning approaches to few-shot classification are computationally\nefficient at test time requiring just a few optimization steps or single\nforward pass to learn a new task, but they remain highly memory-intensive to\ntrain. This limitation arises because a task's entire support set, which can\ncontain up to 1000 images, must be processed before an optimization step can be\ntaken. Harnessing the performance gains offered by large images thus requires\neither parallelizing the meta-learner across multiple GPUs, which may not be\navailable, or trade-offs between task and image size when memory constraints\napply. We improve on both options by proposing LITE, a general and memory\nefficient episodic training scheme that enables meta-training on large tasks\ncomposed of large images on a single GPU. We achieve this by observing that the\ngradients for a task can be decomposed into a sum of gradients over the task's\ntraining images. This enables us to perform a forward pass on a task's entire\ntraining set but realize significant memory savings by back-propagating only a\nrandom subset of these images which we show is an unbiased approximation of the\nfull gradient. We use LITE to train meta-learners and demonstrate new\nstate-of-the-art accuracy on the real-world ORBIT benchmark and 3 of the 4\nparts of the challenging VTAB+MD benchmark relative to leading meta-learners.\nLITE also enables meta-learners to be competitive with transfer learning\napproaches but at a fraction of the test-time computational cost, thus serving\nas a counterpoint to the recent narrative that transfer learning is all you\nneed for few-shot classification.",

    "abstract": "The deep image prior has demonstrated the remarkable ability that untrained\nnetworks can address inverse imaging problems, such as denoising, inpainting\nand super-resolution, by optimizing on just a single degraded image. Despite\nits promise, it suffers from two limitations. First, it remains unclear how one\ncan control the prior beyond the choice of the network architecture. Second, it\nrequires an oracle to determine when to stop the optimization as the\nperformance degrades after reaching a peak. In this paper, we study the deep\nimage prior from a spectral bias perspective to address these problems. By\nintroducing a frequency-band correspondence measure, we observe that deep image\npriors for inverse imaging exhibit a spectral bias during optimization, where\nlow-frequency image signals are learned faster and better than high-frequency\nnoise signals. This pinpoints why degraded images can be denoised or inpainted\nwhen the optimization is stopped at the right time. Based on our observations,\nwe propose to control the spectral bias in the deep image prior to prevent\nperformance degradation and to speed up optimization convergence. We do so in\nthe two core layer types of inverse imaging networks: the convolution layer and\nthe upsampling layer. We present a Lipschitz-controlled approach for the\nconvolution and a Gaussian-controlled approach for the upsampling layer. We\nfurther introduce a stopping criterion to avoid superfluous computation. The\nexperiments on denoising, inpainting and super-resolution show that our method\nno longer suffers from performance degradation during optimization, relieving\nus from the need for an oracle criterion to stop early. We further outline a\nstopping criterion to avoid superfluous computation. Finally, we show that our\napproach obtains favorable restoration results compared to current approaches,\nacross all tasks.",

While featuring superior stability, these estimators crucially depend\non costly large-batch training, and they sacrifice bound tightness for variance\nreduction. To overcome these limitations, we revisit the mathematics of popular\nvariational MI bounds from the lens of unnormalized statistical modeling and\nconvex optimization. Our investigation not only yields a new unified\ntheoretical framework encompassing popular variational MI bounds but also leads\nto a novel, simple, and powerful contrastive MI estimator named as FLO.\nTheoretically, we show that the FLO estimator is tight, and it provably\nconverges under stochastic gradient descent. Empirically, our FLO estimator\novercomes the limitations of its predecessors and learns more efficiently. The\nutility of FLO is verified using an extensive set of benchmarks, which also\nreveals the trade-offs in practical MI estimation.",

    "abstract": "This note is concerned with the presentation of new delay-dependent\ndissipativity-based convex conditions (expressed in the form of linear matrix\ninequalities) for the design of static output feedback (SOF) stabilizing gains\nfor open-loop unstable discrete-time systems with input time-varying delays. A\nmodified definition of QSR-dissipativity combined with the use of\nLyapunov-Krasovskii functionals as storage functions and the application of\nFinsler's Lemma lead to the gathering of non-interactive design conditions. We\nshow that, differently from most works dealing with controller design for\ntime-delayed systems, the developed conditions present very small conservatism\ncompared to stability analysis conditions derived with the same strategy. Due\nto being a particular case of SOF with an identity output matrix, static state\nfeedback (SSF) gains can also trivially be computed from the conditions.",

    "title": "Simpler, Faster, Stronger: Breaking The log-K Curse On Contrastive  Learners With FlatNCE",
    "abstract": "InfoNCE-based contrastive representation learners, such as SimCLR, have been\ntremendously successful in recent years. However, these contrastive schemes are\nnotoriously resource demanding, as their effectiveness breaks down with\nsmall-batch training (i.e., the log-K curse, whereas K is the batch-size). In\nthis work, we reveal mathematically why contrastive learners fail in the\nsmall-batch-size regime, and present a novel simple, non-trivial contrastive\nobjective named FlatNCE, which fixes this issue. Unlike InfoNCE, our FlatNCE no\nlonger explicitly appeals to a discriminative classification goal for\ncontrastive learning. Theoretically, we show FlatNCE is the mathematical dual\nformulation of InfoNCE, thus bridging the classical literature on energy\nmodeling; and empirically, we demonstrate that, with minimal modification of\ncode, FlatNCE enables immediate performance boost independent of the\nsubject-matter engineering efforts. The significance of this work is furthered\nby the powerful generalization of contrastive learning techniques, and the\nintroduction of new tools to monitor and diagnose contrastive training. We\nsubstantiate our claims with empirical evidence on CIFAR10, ImageNet, and other\ndatasets, where FlatNCE consistently outperforms InfoNCE.",

    "title": "Unveiling the structure of wide flat minima in neural networks",
    "abstract": "The success of deep learning has revealed the application potential of neural\nnetworks across the sciences and opened up fundamental theoretical problems. In\nparticular, the fact that learning algorithms based on simple variants of\ngradient methods are able to find near-optimal minima of highly nonconvex loss\nfunctions is an unexpected feature of neural networks which needs to be\nunderstood in depth. Such algorithms are able to fit the data almost perfectly,\neven in the presence of noise, and yet they have excellent predictive\ncapabilities. Several empirical results have shown a reproducible correlation\nbetween the so-called flatness of the minima achieved by the algorithms and the\ngeneralization performance. At the same time, statistical physics results have\nshown that in nonconvex networks a multitude of narrow minima may coexist with\na much smaller number of wide flat minima, which generalize well. Here we show\nthat wide flat minima arise from the coalescence of minima that correspond to\nhigh-margin classifications. Despite being exponentially rare compared to\nzero-margin solutions, high-margin minima tend to concentrate in particular\nregions. These minima are in turn surrounded by other solutions of smaller and\nsmaller margin, leading to dense regions of solutions over long distances. Our\nanalysis also provides an alternative analytical method for estimating when\nflat minima appear and when algorithms begin to find solutions, as the number\nof model parameters varies.",

The system is transformed into\nthe form of a differential-algebraic representation which allows dealing with\nthe broad class of systems whose matrices can present rational or polynomial\ndependence on the parameter. The proposed approach uses the definition of\nstrict QSR dissipativity, Finsler's Lemma, and the notion of linear\nannihilators to formulate conditions expressed in the form of polytopic linear\nmatrix inequalities for determining the gain-scheduled static output feedback\ncontrol for system stabilization. One of the main advantages of the strategy is\nthat it provides a simple design solution in a non-interactive manner.\nFurthermore, no restriction on the plant output matrix is imposed. Numerical\nexamples highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

The adaptive step-size ensures that the\nintegral-action produced by the gradient descent does not destabilize the\nclosed-loop system. To quantify the quality of the gradient estimate, we\npresent a batch least squares estimator with a novel weighting and show that it\nproduces bounded estimation errors, where the uncertainty is due to the\ncurvature of the unknown cost function. The adaptive step-size then maximizes\nthe decrease of the combined plant and controller Lyapunov function for the\nworst-case estimation error.

Finally, we demonstrate our proposed ESC\nthrough five numerical examples; one illustrative, one practical, and three\nbenchmarks.",

This is achieved by using an attention mechanism on\nmultiple speaker embeddings to compute a single attentive embedding, which is\nthen used as a side input to the model. We implemented multi-user\nVoiceFilter-Lite and evaluated it for three tasks: (1) a streaming automatic\nspeech recognition (ASR) task; (2) a text-independent speaker verification\ntask; and (3) a personalized keyphrase detection task, where ASR has to detect\nkeyphrases from multiple enrolled users in a noisy environment. Our experiments\nshow that, with up to four enrolled users, multi-user VoiceFilter-Lite is able\nto significantly reduce speech recognition and speaker verification errors when\nthere is overlapping speech, without affecting performance under other acoustic\nconditions. This attentive speaker embedding approach can also be easily\napplied to other speaker-conditioned models such as personal VAD and\npersonalized ASR.",
