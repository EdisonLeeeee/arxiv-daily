Despite the large body of\nwork on the topic, the benefit of solutions is mostly evaluated from a\nconceptual or theoretical point of view and the usefulness for real-world use\ncases remains uncertain. In this work, we aim to state clear user-centric\ndesiderata for explainable AI reflecting common explainability needs\nexperienced in statistical production systems of the European Central Bank. We\nlink the desiderata to archetypical user roles and give examples of techniques\nand methods which can be used to address the user's needs.

    "abstract": "We introduce the first application of the lean methodology to machine\nlearning projects. Similar to lean startups and lean manufacturing, we argue\nthat lean machine learning (LeanML) can drastically slash avoidable wastes in\ncommercial machine learning projects, reduce the business risk in investing in\nmachine learning capabilities and, in so doing, further democratize access to\nmachine learning. The lean design pattern we propose in this paper is based on\ntwo realizations. First, it is possible to estimate the best performance one\nmay achieve when predicting an outcome $y \\in \\mathcal{Y}$ using a given set of\nexplanatory variables $x \\in \\mathcal{X}$, for a wide range of performance\nmetrics, and without training any predictive model. Second, doing so is\nconsiderably easier, faster, and cheaper than learning the best predictive\nmodel. We derive formulae expressing the best $R^2$, MSE, classification\naccuracy, and log-likelihood per observation achievable when using $x$ to\npredict $y$ as a function of the mutual information $I\\left(y; x\\right)$, and\npossibly a measure of the variability of $y$ (e.g. its Shannon entropy in the\ncase of classification accuracy, and its variance in the case regression MSE).\nWe illustrate the efficacy of the LeanML design pattern on a wide range of\nregression and classification problems, synthetic and real-life.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel approach to 3D deformable object\nmanipulation leveraging a deep neural network called DeformerNet. Controlling\nthe shape of a 3D object requires an effective state representation that can\ncapture the full 3D geometry of the object. Current methods work around this\nproblem by defining a set of feature points on the object or only deforming the\nobject in 2D image space, which does not truly address the 3D shape control\nproblem. Instead, we explicitly use 3D point clouds as the state representation\nand apply Convolutional Neural Network on point clouds to learn the 3D\nfeatures. These features are then mapped to the robot end-effector's position\nusing a fully-connected neural network. Once trained in an end-to-end fashion,\nDeformerNet directly maps the current point cloud of a deformable object, as\nwell as a target point cloud shape, to the desired displacement in robot\ngripper position. In addition, we investigate the problem of predicting the\nmanipulation point location given the initial and goal shape of the object.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the strategic behavior of miners in a blockchain is of great\nimportance for its proper operation. A common model for mining games considers\nan infinite time horizon, with players optimizing asymptotic average\nobjectives. Implicitly, this assumes that the asymptotic behaviors are realized\nat human-scale times, otherwise invalidating current models. We study the\nmining game utilizing Markov Decision Processes. Our approach allows us to\ndescribe the asymptotic behavior of the game in terms of the stationary\ndistribution of the induced Markov chain. We focus on a model with two players\nunder immediate release, assuming two different objectives: the (asymptotic)\naverage reward per turn and the (asymptotic) percentage of obtained blocks.\nUsing tools from Markov chain analysis, we show the existence of a strategy\nachieving slow mixing times, exponential in the policy parameters. This result\nemphasizes the imperative need to understand convergence rates in mining games,\nvalidating the standard models. Towards this end, we provide upper bounds for\nthe mixing time of certain meaningful classes of strategies. This result yields\ncriteria for establishing that long-term averaged functions are coherent as\npayoff functions. Moreover, by studying hitting times, we provide a criterion\nto validate the common simplification of considering finite states models. For\nboth considered objectives functions, we provide explicit formulae depending on\nthe stationary distribution of the underlying Markov chain. In particular, this\nshows that both mentioned objectives are not equivalent. Finally, we perform a\nmarket share case study in a particular regime of the game. More precisely, we\nshow that an strategic player with a sufficiently large processing power can\nimpose negative revenue on honest players.",

We show how to\nbypass this question using a refined sketching technique, and obtain optimal or\nnearly optimal bounds for these problems. A key technique we use is an explicit\nmapping of Indyk based on uncertainty principles and extractors, which after\nfirst applying known oblivious subspace embeddings, allows us to quickly spread\nout the mass of the vector so that sampling is now effective, and we avoid a\nlogarithmic factor that is standard in the sketching dimension resulting from\nmatrix Chernoff bounds. For the fundamental problems of rank computation and\nfinding a linearly independent subset of columns, our algorithms improve\nCheung, Kwok, and Lau (JACM, 2013) and are optimal to within a constant factor\nand a $\\log\\log(n)$-factor, respectively.

This data leak is particularly\nchallenging for deep learning recommendation models, where data associated with\na user is used to train a model. Recommendation models use embedding tables to\nmap categorical data (embedding table indices) to large vector space, which is\neasier for recommendation systems to learn. Oblivious RAM (ORAM) and its\nenhancements are proposed solutions to prevent memory access patterns from\nleaking information. ORAM solutions hide access patterns by fetching multiple\ndata blocks per each demand fetch and then shuffling the location of blocks\nafter each access. In this paper, we propose a new PathORAM architecture\ndesigned to protect user input privacy when training recommendation models.\nLook Ahead ORAM exploits the fact that during training, embedding table indices\nthat are going to be accessed in a future batch are known beforehand. Look\nAhead ORAM preprocesses future training samples to identify indices that will\nco-occur and groups these accesses into a large superblock. Look Ahead ORAM\nperforms the same-path assignment by grouping multiple data blocks into\nsuperblocks. Accessing a superblock will require fewer fetched data blocks than\naccessing all data blocks without grouping them as superblocks. Effectively,\nLook Ahead ORAM reduces the number of reads/writes per access. Look Ahead ORAM\nalso introduces a fat-tree structure for PathORAM, i.e. a tree with variable\nbucket size.

    "abstract": "Large, pre-trained transformer models like BERT have achieved\nstate-of-the-art results on document understanding tasks, but most\nimplementations can only consider 512 tokens at a time. For many real-world\napplications, documents can be much longer, and the segmentation strategies\ntypically used on longer documents miss out on document structure and\ncontextual information, hurting their results on downstream tasks. In our work\non legal agreements, we find that visual cues such as layout, style, and\nplacement of text in a document are strong features that are crucial to\nachieving an acceptable level of accuracy on long documents. We measure the\nimpact of incorporating such visual cues, obtained via computer vision methods,\non the accuracy of document understanding tasks including document\nsegmentation, entity extraction, and attribute classification.

ML-powered\nproducts are now embedded in our digital lives: from recommendations of what to\nwatch, to divining our search intent, to powering virtual assistants in\nconsumer and enterprise settings. Recent successes in applying ML in natural\nsciences revealed that ML can be used to tackle some of the hardest real-world\nproblems humanity faces today. For these reasons ML has become central in the\nstrategy of tech companies and has gathered even more attention from academia\nthan ever before. Despite these successes, what we have witnessed so far is\njust the beginning. Right now the people training and using ML models are\nexpert developers working within large organizations, but we believe the next\nwave of ML systems will allow a larger amount of people, potentially without\ncoding skills, to perform the same tasks. These new ML systems will not require\nusers to fully understand all the details of how models are trained and\nutilized for obtaining predictions. Declarative interfaces are well suited for\nthis goal, by hiding complexity and favouring separation of interests, and can\nlead to increased productivity. We worked on such abstract interfaces by\ndeveloping two declarative ML systems, Overton and Ludwig, that require users\nto declare only their data schema (names and types of inputs) and tasks rather\nthen writing low level ML code. In this article we will describe how ML systems\nare currently structured, highlight important factors for their success and\nadoption, what are the issues current ML systems are facing and how the systems\nwe developed addressed them.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a new dual quaternion-based formulation for pose-based\nvisual servoing. Extending our previous work on local contact moment (LoCoMo)\nbased grasp planning, we demonstrate grasping of arbitrarily moving objects in\n3D space. Instead of using the conventional axis-angle parameterization, dual\nquaternions allow designing the visual servoing task in a more compact manner\nand provide robustness to manipulator singularities. Given an object point\ncloud, LoCoMo generates a ranked list of grasp and pre-grasp poses, which are\nused as desired poses for visual servoing. Whenever the object moves (tracked\nby visual marker tracking), the desired pose updates automatically. For this,\ncapitalising on the dual quaternion spatial distance error, we propose a\ndynamic grasp re-ranking metric to select the best feasible grasp for the\nmoving object. This allows the robot to readily track and grasp arbitrarily\nmoving objects. In addition, we also explore the robot null-space with our\ncontroller to avoid joint limits so as to achieve smooth trajectories while\nfollowing moving objects. We evaluate the performance of the proposed visual\nservoing by conducting simulation experiments of grasping various objects using\na 7-axis robot fitted with a 2-finger gripper. Obtained results demonstrate the\nefficiency of our proposed visual servoing.",

URLLC\nservice requires the user equipment (UE) to be able to transmit its data under\nstrict latency constraints with high reliability. To address these\nrequirements, new technologies, such as mini-slots, semi-persistent scheduling\nand grant-free access were introduced in 5G standards. In this work, we\nformulate a spatiotemporal mathematical model to evaluate the user-plane\nlatency and reliability performance of millimetre wave (mmWave) massive\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) URLLC with reactive and K-repetition\nhybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) protocols. We derive closed-form\napproximate expressions for the latent access failure probability and validate\nthem using numerical simulations. The results show that, under certain\nconditions, mmWave massive MIMO can reduce the failure probability by a factor\nof 32. Moreover, we identify that beyond a certain number of antennas there is\nno significant improvement in reliability.

Existing barriers like increased congestion, multiple\nsignalized intersections, queued vehicles, traffic phase timing etc. can\nprevent emergency vehicles (EVs) achieving desired response times.

    "abstract": "Although deep learning has demonstrated astonishing performance in many\napplications, there are still concerns on their dependability. One desirable\nproperty of deep learning applications with societal impact is fairness (i.e.,\nnon-discrimination). Unfortunately, discrimination might be intrinsically\nembedded into the models due to discrimination in the training data. As a\ncountermeasure, fairness testing systemically identifies discriminative\nsamples, which can be used to retrain the model and improve its fairness.\nExisting fairness testing approaches however have two major limitations. First,\nthey only work well on traditional machine learning models and have poor\nperformance (e.g., effectiveness and efficiency) on deep learning models.\nSecond, they only work on simple tabular data and are not applicable for\ndomains such as text. In this work, we bridge the gap by proposing a scalable\nand effective approach for systematically searching for discriminative samples\nwhile extending fairness testing to address a challenging domain, i.e., text\nclassification. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our approach only\nemploys lightweight procedures like gradient computation and clustering, which\nmakes it significantly more scalable. Experimental results show that on\naverage, our approach explores the search space more effectively (9.62 and 2.38\ntimes more than the state-of-art methods respectively on tabular and text\ndatasets) and generates much more individual discriminatory instances (24.95\nand 2.68 times) within reasonable time.

We have fabricated bi-layer resistive random-access memory (RRAM)\ndevices with Ta$_2$O$_5$ and Al$_2$O$_3$ layers. The device has been\ncharacterized and modeled. The compact models of RRAM and {\\alpha}-IGZO based\nembedded nanosheet structures have been used to evaluate the system-level\nperformance of 8 vertically stacked {\\alpha}-IGZO based nanosheet layers with\nRRAM for neuromorphic applications. The model considers the design space with\nuniform bit line (BL), select line (SL), and word line (WL) resistance.\nFinally, we have simulated the weighted sum operation with our proposed 8-layer\nstacked nanosheet-based embedded memory and evaluated the performance for\nVGG-16 convolutional neural network (CNN) for Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 data\nrecognition, which yielded 92% and 75% accuracy respectively with drop out\nlayers amid device variation.",

    "abstract": "The high-dimensional or sparse reward task of a reinforcement learning (RL)\nenvironment requires a superior potential controller such as hierarchical\nreinforcement learning (HRL) rather than an atomic RL because it absorbs the\ncomplexity of commands to achieve the purpose of the task in its hierarchical\nstructure. One of the HRL issues is how to train each level policy with the\noptimal data collection from its experience. That is to say, how to synchronize\nadjacent level policies optimally. Our research finds that a HRL model through\nthe off-policy correction technique of HRL, which trains a higher-level policy\nwith the goal of reflecting a lower-level policy which is newly trained using\nthe off-policy method, takes the critical role of synchronizing both level\npolicies at all times while they are being trained. We propose a novel HRL\nmodel supporting the optimal level synchronization using the off-policy\ncorrection technique with a deep generative model. This uses the advantage of\nthe inverse operation of a flow-based deep generative model (FDGM) to achieve\nthe goal corresponding to the current state of the lower-level policy. The\nproposed model also considers the freedom of the goal dimension between HRL\npolicies which makes it the generalized inverse model of the model-free RL in\nHRL with the optimal synchronization method. The comparative experiment results\nshow the performance of our proposed model.",

    "abstract": "Industrial standards for developing medical device software provide\nrequirements that conforming devices must meet. A number of reference software\narchitectures have been proposed to develop such software. The ISO/IEC\n25010:2011 family of standards provides a comprehensive software product\nquality model, including characteristics that are highly desirable in medical\ndevices. Furthermore, frameworks like 4+1 Views provide a robust framework to\ndevelop the software architecture or high level design for any software,\nincluding for medical devices. However, the alignment between industrial\nstandards and reference architectures for medical device software, on one hand,\nand ISO/IEC 25010:2011 and 4+1 Views, on the other, is not well understood.\nThis paper aims to explore how ISO/IEC 25010:2011 and 4+1 Views are supported\nby current standards, namely ISO 13485:2016, ISO 14971:2012, IEC 62304:2006 and\nIEC 62366:2015, and current reference architectures for medical device\nsoftware. We classified requirements from medical devices standards into\nqualities from ISO/IEC 25010:2011 and architectural views from 4+1 Views. A\nsystematic literature review (SLR) method was followed to review current\nreferences software architectures and a mapping of their support for the\nidentified ISO/IEC 25010:2011 qualities in the previous step was carried out.\nOur results show that ISO/IEC 25010:2011 qualities like functional suitability,\nportability, maintainability, usability, security, reliability and\ncompatibility are highly emphasised in medical device standards. Furthermore,\nwe show that current reference architectures only partially support these\nqualities. This paper can help medical device developers identify focus areas\nfor developing standards-compliant software. A wider study involving\nunder-development medical devices can help improve the accuracy of our findings\nin the future.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning has recently demonstrated impressive progress in predictive\naccuracy across a wide array of tasks. Most ML approaches focus on\ngeneralization performance on unseen data that are similar to the training data\n(In-Distribution, or IND). However, real world applications and deployments of\nML rarely enjoy the comfort of encountering examples that are always IND. In\nsuch situations, most ML models commonly display erratic behavior on\nOut-of-Distribution (OOD) examples, such as assigning high confidence to wrong\npredictions, or vice-versa. Implications of such unusual model behavior are\nfurther exacerbated in the healthcare setting, where patient health can\npotentially be put at risk. It is crucial to study the behavior and robustness\nproperties of models under distributional shift, understand common failure\nmodes, and take mitigation steps before the model is deployed. Having a\nbenchmark that shines light upon these aspects of a model is a first and\nnecessary step in addressing the issue. Recent work and interest in increasing\nmodel robustness in OOD settings have focused more on image modality, while the\nElectronic Health Record (EHR) modality is still largely under-explored. We aim\nto bridge this gap by releasing BEDS-Bench, a benchmark for quantifying the\nbehavior of ML models over EHR data under OOD settings. We use two open access,\nde-identified EHR datasets to construct several OOD data settings to run tests\non, and measure relevant metrics that characterize crucial aspects of a model's\nOOD behavior. We evaluate several learning algorithms under BEDS-Bench and find\nthat all of them show poor generalization performance under distributional\nshift in general. Our results highlight the need and the potential to improve\nrobustness of EHR models under distributional shift, and BEDS-Bench provides\none way to measure progress towards that goal.",

    "abstract": "In fine-grained image recognition (FGIR), the localization and amplification\nof region attention is an important factor, which has been explored a lot by\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) based approaches. The recently developed\nvision transformer (ViT) has achieved promising results on computer vision\ntasks. Compared with CNNs, Image sequentialization is a brand new manner.\nHowever, ViT is limited in its receptive field size and thus lacks local\nattention like CNNs due to the fixed size of its patches, and is unable to\ngenerate multi-scale features to learn discriminative region attention. To\nfacilitate the learning of discriminative region attention without box/part\nannotations, we use the strength of the attention weights to measure the\nimportance of the patch tokens corresponding to the raw images. We propose the\nrecurrent attention multi-scale transformer (RAMS-Trans), which uses the\ntransformer's self-attention to recursively learn discriminative region\nattention in a multi-scale manner. Specifically, at the core of our approach\nlies the dynamic patch proposal module (DPPM) guided region amplification to\ncomplete the integration of multi-scale image patches. The DPPM starts with the\nfull-size image patches and iteratively scales up the region attention to\ngenerate new patches from global to local by the intensity of the attention\nweights generated at each scale as an indicator. Our approach requires only the\nattention weights that come with ViT itself and can be easily trained\nend-to-end. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAMS-Trans performs better\nthan concurrent works, in addition to efficient CNN models, achieving\nstate-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets.",

However, SBL needs to invert a big\ncovariance matrix with complexity O(M^3 ) (M: feature size) for updating the\nregularization priors, making it difficult for practical use. There are three\nissues in SBL: 1) Inverting the covariance matrix may obtain singular solutions\nin some cases, which hinders SBL from convergence; 2) Poor scalability to\nproblems with high dimensional feature space or large data size; 3) SBL easily\nsuffers from memory overflow for large-scale data. This paper addresses these\nissues with a newly proposed diagonal Quasi-Newton (DQN) method for SBL called\nDQN-SBL where the inversion of big covariance matrix is ignored so that the\ncomplexity and memory storage are reduced to O(M). The DQN-SBL is thoroughly\nevaluated on non-linear classifiers and linear feature selection using various\nbenchmark datasets of different sizes.

We propose a dynamic machine translation model that\nscales the Transformer architecture based on the available resources at any\nparticular time. The proposed approach, 'Dynamic-HAT', uses a HAT\nSuperTransformer as the backbone to search for SubTransformers with different\naccuracy-latency trade-offs at design time. The optimal SubTransformers are\nsampled from the SuperTransformer at run-time, depending on latency\nconstraints. The Dynamic-HAT is tested on the Jetson Nano and the approach uses\ninherited SubTransformers sampled directly from the SuperTransformer with a\nswitching time of <1s. Using inherited SubTransformers results in a BLEU score\nloss of <1.5% because the SubTransformer configuration is not retrained from\nscratch after sampling. However, to recover this loss in performance, the\ndimensions of the design space can be reduced to tailor it to a family of\ntarget hardware. The new reduced design space results in a BLEU score increase\nof approximately 1% for sub-optimal models from the original design space, with\na wide range for performance scaling between 0.356s - 1.526s for the GPU and\n2.9s - 7.31s for the CPU.",

    "abstract": "In order to train robust deep learning models, large amounts of labelled data\nis required. However, in the absence of such large repositories of labelled\ndata, unlabeled data can be exploited for the same. Semi-Supervised learning\naims to utilize such unlabeled data for training classification models. Recent\nprogress of self-training based approaches have shown promise in this area,\nwhich leads to this study where we utilize an ensemble approach for the same. A\nby-product of any semi-supervised approach may be loss of calibration of the\ntrained model especially in scenarios where unlabeled data may contain\nout-of-distribution samples, which leads to this investigation on how to adapt\nto such effects. Our proposed algorithm carefully avoids common pitfalls in\nutilizing unlabeled data and leads to a more accurate and calibrated supervised\nmodel compared to vanilla self-training based student-teacher algorithms. We\nperform several experiments on the popular STL-10 database followed by an\nextensive analysis of our approach and study its effects on model accuracy and\ncalibration.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that initializing neural machine translation\n(NMT) models with the pre-trained language models (LM) can speed up the model\ntraining and boost the model performance. In this work, we identify a critical\nside-effect of pre-training for NMT, which is due to the discrepancy between\nthe training objectives of LM-based pre-training and NMT. Since the LM\nobjective learns to reconstruct a few source tokens and copy most of them, the\npre-training initialization would affect the copying behaviors of NMT models.\nWe provide a quantitative analysis of copying behaviors by introducing a metric\ncalled copying ratio, which empirically shows that pre-training based NMT\nmodels have a larger copying ratio than the standard one. In response to this\nproblem, we propose a simple and effective method named copying penalty to\ncontrol the copying behaviors in decoding. Extensive experiments on both\nin-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks show that the copying penalty method\nconsistently improves translation performance by controlling copying behaviors\nfor pre-training based NMT models.

We\npresent a large-scale bibliometric analysis based on approximately 120,000\nclimate change publications between 2001 and 2018 to examine how climate change\nis studied in scientific research. Our analysis provides an overview of\nscientific knowledge, shifts of research hotspots, global geographical\ndistribution of research, and focus of individual countries. In our analysis,\nwe identify five key fields in climate change research: physical sciences,\npaleoclimatology, climate-change ecology, climate technology, and climate\npolicy. We draw the following key conclusions: (1) Over the investigated time\nperiod, the focus of climate change research has shifted from understanding the\nclimate system toward climate technologies and policies, such as efficient\nenergy use and legislation. (2) There is an imbalance in scientific production\nbetween developed and developing countries. (3) Geography, national demands,\nand national strategies have been important drivers that influence the research\ninterests and concerns of researchers in different countries.

A solution algorithm is proposed for the mathematical program with\nschedule-based transit equilibrium constraints (MPEC) with computational\ncomplexity of O(N^2 L) where N and L represent the number of stops and transit\nlines respectively. The equilibrium constraints corresponding to the\nschedule-based hyperpath flow is adapted from the literature with some\nmodifications to fit it into an estimation problem. Computational experiments\nare conducted first to verify the methodology with two synthetic data sets (one\nof which is Sioux Falls), followed by a validation of the method using bus data\nfrom Qingpu District in Shanghai, China from July 1, 2016, with 4 bus lines,\n120 segments, 55 bus stops, and 120 one-minute intervals; this is one of the\nlargest implementation of the schedule-based assignment model with congestion\neffects in the literature and the first for passenger flow estimation based on\nit. The estimation model converged to 0.005 tolerance of relative change in 10\niterations. The estimated average of segment flows are only 2.5% off from the\naverage of the observed segment flows; relative errors among segments are\n42.5%, which compares well with OD estimation methods applied to real data in\nthe literature (e.g. Irvine network, Brescia motorway).",

    "abstract": "An important component for generalization in machine learning is to uncover\nunderlying latent factors of variation as well as the mechanism through which\neach factor acts in the world. In this paper, we test whether 17 unsupervised,\nweakly supervised, and fully supervised representation learning approaches\ncorrectly infer the generative factors of variation in simple datasets\n(dSprites, Shapes3D, MPI3D). In contrast to prior robustness work that\nintroduces novel factors of variation during test time, such as blur or other\n(un)structured noise, we here recompose, interpolate, or extrapolate only\nexisting factors of variation from the training data set (e.g., small and\nmedium-sized objects during training and large objects during testing). Models\nthat learn the correct mechanism should be able to generalize to this\nbenchmark. In total, we train and test 2000+ models and observe that all of\nthem struggle to learn the underlying mechanism regardless of supervision\nsignal and architectural bias. Moreover, the generalization capabilities of all\ntested models drop significantly as we move from artificial datasets towards\nmore realistic real-world datasets. Despite their inability to identify the\ncorrect mechanism, the models are quite modular as their ability to infer other\nin-distribution factors remains fairly stable, providing only a single factor\nis out-of-distribution.

    "abstract": "Vehicle re-identification (Re-ID) is to retrieve images of the same vehicle\nacross different cameras. Two key challenges lie in the subtle inter-instance\ndiscrepancy caused by near-duplicate identities and the large intra-instance\nvariance caused by different views. Since the holistic appearance suffers from\nviewpoint variation and distortion, part-level feature learning has been\nintroduced to enhance vehicle description. However, existing approaches to\nlocalize and amplify significant parts often fail to handle spatial\nmisalignment as well as occlusion and require expensive annotations. In this\npaper, we propose a weakly supervised Part-Mentored Attention Network (PMANet)\ncomposed of a Part Attention Network (PANet) for vehicle part localization with\nself-attention and a Part-Mentored Network (PMNet) for mentoring the global and\nlocal feature aggregation. Firstly, PANet is introduced to predict a foreground\nmask and pinpoint $K$ prominent vehicle parts only with weak identity\nsupervision. Secondly, we propose a PMNet to learn global and part-level\nfeatures with multi-scale attention and aggregate them in $K$ main-partial\ntasks via part transfer. Like humans who first differentiate objects with\ngeneral information and then observe salient parts for more detailed clues,\nPANet and PMNet construct a two-stage attention structure to perform a\ncoarse-to-fine search among identities. Finally, we address this Re-ID issue as\na multi-task problem, including global feature learning, identity\nclassification, and part transfer. We adopt Homoscedastic Uncertainty to learn\nthe optimal weighing of different losses. Comprehensive experiments are\nconducted on two benchmark datasets. Our approach outperforms recent\nstate-of-the-art methods by averagely 2.63% in CMC@1 on VehicleID and 2.2% in\nmAP on VeRi776. Results on occluded test sets also demonstrate the\ngeneralization ability of PMANet.",

    "abstract": "Cooperative vehicular technology in recent times has aided in realizing some\nstate-of-art technologies like autonomous driving. Effective and efficient\nprioritization of emergency vehicles (EVs) using cooperative vehicular\ntechnology can undoubtedly aid in saving property and lives. Contemporary EV\nprioritization, called preemption, is highly dependent on existing traffic\ninfrastructure. Accessing crucial decision parameters for preemption like\nspeed, position and acceleration data in real-time is almost impossible in\ncurrent systems. The connected vehicle can provide such data in real-time,\nwhich makes EV preemption more responsive and effective. Also, autonomous\nvehicles can help in optimizing the timing in traffic phases and minimize\nhuman-related loss like higher headway times and inconsistent inter-vehicle\nspacing when following each other. In this paper, we introduce\nself-coordinating a decentralized traffic control system termed as Virtual\nTraffic Light plus for Emergency Vehicle (VTL+EV) to prioritize EVs in an\nintersection. The proposed system can expedite EVs movement through\nintersections and impose minimal waiting time for ordinary vehicles. The VTL+EV\nalgorithm also can improve overall throughput making an intersection more\nefficient.",

With regards to the brains of the\noffspring, we use two methods to create them. The first one entails solely\nevolution which means the brain of a robot child is inherited from its parents.\nThe second approach is evolution plus learning which means the brain of a child\nis inherited as well, but additionally is developed by a learning algorithm -\nRevDEknn. We compare these two methods by running experiments in a simulator\ncalled Revolve and use efficiency, efficacy, and the morphology intelligence of\nthe robots for the comparison. The experiments show that the evolution plus\nlearning method does not only lead to a higher fitness level, but also to more\nmorphologically evolving robots.

The relevance of the latter resides in the fact that producing\nlogical descriptions of real-world phenomena, requires people to agree on how\nsuch descriptions are to be interpreted and understood by human beings, so that\nsystems can be built with confidence in accordance with their specification. On\nthe more practical side, the metalogical relation between syntax and semantics,\ndetermines important aspects of the conclusions one can draw from the\napplication of certain analysis techniques, like model checking.\nAbstract model theory (i.e., the mathematical perspective on semantics of\nlogical languages) is of little practical value to software engineering\nendeavours. From our point of view, values (those that can be assigned to\nconstants and variables) should not be just points in a platonic domain of\ninterpretation, but elements that can be named by means of terms over the\nsignature of the specification.

    "title": "Throughput Maximization of UAV Networks",
    "abstract": "In this paper we study the deployment of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles\n(UAVs) to form a temporal UAV network for the provisioning of emergent\ncommunications to affected people in a disaster zone, where each UAV is\nequipped with a lightweight base station device and thus can act as an aerial\nbase station for users. Unlike most existing studies that assumed that a UAV\ncan serve all users in its communication range, we observe that both\ncomputation and communication capabilities of a single lightweight UAV are very\nlimited, due to various constraints on its size, weight, and power supply.\nThus, a single UAV can only provide communication services to a limited number\nof users. We study a novel problem of deploying $K$ UAVs in the top of a\ndisaster area such that the sum of the data rates of users served by the UAVs\nis maximized, subject to that (i) the number of users served by each UAV is no\ngreater than its service capacity; and (ii) the communication network induced\nby the $K$ UAVs is connected. We then propose a $\\frac{1-1/e}{\\lfloor \\sqrt{K}\n\\rfloor}$-approximation algorithm for the problem, improving the current best\nresult of the problem by five times (the best approximation ratio so far is\n$\\frac{1-1/e}{5( \\sqrt{K} +1)}$), where $e$ is the base of the natural\nlogarithm. We finally evaluate the algorithm performance via simulation\nexperiments. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is very\npromising. Especially, the solution delivered by the proposed algorithm is up\nto 12% better than those by existing algorithms.",

    "abstract": "The concept of flow is used extensively in HCI, video games, and many other\nfields, but its prevalent definition is conceptually vague and alternative\ninterpretations have contributed to ambiguity in the literature. To address\nthis, we use cognitive science theory to expose inconsistencies in flow's\nprevalent definition, and introduce fuse, a concept related to flow but\nconsistent with cognitive science, and defined as the \"fusion of\nactivity-related sensory stimuli and awareness\". Based on this definition, we\ndevelop a preliminary model that hypothesizes fuse's underlying cognitive\nprocesses. To illustrate the model's practical value, we derive a set of design\nheuristics that we exemplify in the context of video games. Together, the fuse\ndefinition, model and design heuristics form our theoretical framework, and are\na product of rethinking flow from a cognitive perspective with the purpose of\nimproving conceptual clarity and theoretical robustness in the literature.",

We introduce a new class of mechanisms composing a traditional\nGeneralized Second Price auction (GSP) with different fair division schemes to\nachieve some desired level of fairness between two groups of Bayesian strategic\nadvertisers. We propose two mechanisms, $\\beta$-Fair GSP and GSP-EFX, that\ncompose GSP with, respectively, an envy-free up to one item (EF1), and an\nenvy-free up to any item (EFX) fair division scheme. The payments of GSP are\nadjusted in order to compensate the advertisers that suffer a loss of\nefficiency due the fair division stage. We prove that, for both mechanisms, if\nbidders play so as to minimize their external regret they are guaranteed to\nreach an equilibrium with good social welfare. We also prove that the\nmechanisms are budget balanced, so that the payments charged by the traditional\nGSP mechanism are a good proxy of the total compensation offered to the\nadvertisers. Finally, we evaluate the quality of the allocations of the two\nmechanisms through experiments on real-world data.",

    "abstract": "Perception of time from sequentially acquired sensory inputs is rooted in\neveryday behaviors of individual organisms. Yet, most algorithms for\ntime-series modeling fail to learn dynamics of random event timings directly\nfrom visual or audio inputs, requiring timing annotations during training that\nare usually unavailable for real-world applications. For instance, neuroscience\nperspectives on postdiction imply that there exist variable temporal ranges\nwithin which the incoming sensory inputs can affect the earlier perception, but\nsuch temporal ranges are mostly unannotated for real applications such as\nautomatic speech recognition (ASR). In this paper, we present a probabilistic\nordinary differential equation (ODE), called STochastic boundaRy ODE (STRODE),\nthat learns both the timings and the dynamics of time series data without\nrequiring any timing annotations during training. STRODE allows the usage of\ndifferential equations to sample from the posterior point processes,\nefficiently and analytically. We further provide theoretical guarantees on the\nlearning of STRODE. Our empirical results show that our approach successfully\ninfers event timings of time series data.

A set $S\\subseteq V(G)$\nis said to be an independent set if no two vertices in $S$ are adjacent in $G$.\nA kernel (resp. solution) of $G$ is an independent and absorbing (resp.\ndominating) set in $G$. We explore the algorithmic complexity of these problems\nin the well known class of interval digraphs. A digraph $G$ is an interval\ndigraph if a pair of intervals $(S_u,T_u)$ can be assigned to each vertex $u$\nof $G$ such that $(u,v)\\in E(G)$ if and only if $S_u\\cap T_v\\neq\\emptyset$.\nMany different subclasses of interval digraphs have been defined and studied in\nthe literature by restricting the kinds of pairs of intervals that can be\nassigned to the vertices. We observe that several of these classes, like\ninterval catch digraphs, interval nest digraphs, adjusted interval digraphs and\nchronological interval digraphs, are subclasses of the more general class of\nreflexive interval digraphs -- which arise when we require that the two\nintervals assigned to a vertex have to intersect. We show that all the problems\nmentioned above are efficiently solvable, in most of the cases even linear-time\nsolvable, in the class of reflexive interval digraphs, but are APX-hard on even\nthe very restricted class of interval digraphs called point-point digraphs,\nwhere the two intervals assigned to each vertex are required to be degenerate,\ni.e. they consist of a single point each. The results we obtain improve and\ngeneralize several existing algorithms and structural results for subclasses of\nreflexive interval digraphs.",

Many different approaches\nhave been explored for approximate policy evaluation, but less is understood\nabout approximate greedification and what choices guarantee policy improvement.\nIn this work, we investigate approximate greedification when reducing the KL\ndivergence between the parameterized policy and the Boltzmann distribution over\naction values. In particular, we investigate the difference between the forward\nand reverse KL divergences, with varying degrees of entropy regularization. We\nshow that the reverse KL has stronger policy improvement guarantees, but that\nreducing the forward KL can result in a worse policy. We also demonstrate,\nhowever, that a large enough reduction of the forward KL can induce improvement\nunder additional assumptions. Empirically, we show on simple continuous-action\nenvironments that the forward KL can induce more exploration, but at the cost\nof a more suboptimal policy. No significant differences were observed in the\ndiscrete-action setting or on a suite of benchmark problems. Throughout, we\nhighlight that many policy gradient methods can be seen as an instance of API,\nwith either the forward or reverse KL for the policy update, and discuss next\nsteps for understanding and improving our policy optimization algorithms.",

    "abstract": "We focus on the dominant poles of the transfer function of a descriptor\nsystem. The transfer function typically exhibits large norm at and near the\nimaginary parts of the dominant poles. Consequently, the dominant poles provide\ninformation about the points on the imaginary axis where the ${\\mathcal\nL}_\\infty$ norm of the system is attained, and they are also sometimes useful\nto obtain crude reduced-order models. For a large-scale descriptor system, we\nintroduce a subspace framework to estimate a prescribed number of dominant\npoles. At every iteration, the large-scale system is projected into a small\nsystem, whose dominant poles can be computed at ease. Then the projection\nspaces are expanded so that the projected system after subspace expansion\ninterpolates the large-scale system at the computed dominant poles. We prove an\nat-least-quadratic-convergence result for the framework, and provide numerical\nresults confirming this. On real benchmark examples, the proposed framework\nappears to be more accurate than SAMDP [IEEE Trans.

For unordered trees the problem of\nfinding a maximum-weight Tai mapping is known to be NP-complete. In this work,\nwe define an anti Tai mapping $M\\subseteq V_1\\times V_2$ as a binary relation\nbetween two unordered labeled trees such that any two $(x,y), (x', y')\\in M$\nviolate ancestor relationship and thus cannot be part of the same Tai mapping,\ni.e. $(x\\le x' \\iff y\\not \\le y') \\vee (x'\\le x \\iff y'\\not \\le y)$, given an\nancestor order $x<x'$ meaning that $x$ is an ancestor of $x'$. Finding a\nmaximum-weight anti Tai mapping arises in the cutting plane method for solving\nthe maximum-weight Tai mapping problem via integer programming. We give an\nefficient polynomial-time algorithm for finding a maximum-weight anti Tai\nmapping for the case when one of the two trees is a path and further show how\nto extend this result in order to provide a polynomially computable lower bound\non the optimal anti Tai mapping for two unordered labeled trees.

    "title": "PICASO: Permutation-Invariant Cascaded Attentional Set Operator",
    "abstract": "Set-input deep networks have recently drawn much interest in computer vision\nand machine learning. This is in part due to the increasing number of important\ntasks such as meta-learning, clustering, and anomaly detection that are defined\non set inputs. These networks must take an arbitrary number of input samples\nand produce the output invariant to the input set permutation. Several\nalgorithms have been recently developed to address this urgent need. Our paper\nanalyzes these algorithms using both synthetic and real-world datasets, and\nshows that they are not effective in dealing with common data variations such\nas image translation or viewpoint change. To address this limitation, we\npropose a permutation-invariant cascaded attentional set operator (PICASO). The\ngist of PICASO is a cascade of multihead attention blocks with dynamic\ntemplates. The proposed operator is a stand-alone module that can be adapted\nand extended to serve different machine learning tasks. We demonstrate the\nutilities of PICASO in four diverse scenarios: (i) clustering, (ii) image\nclassification under novel viewpoints, (iii) image anomaly detection, and (iv)\nstate prediction. PICASO increases the SmallNORB image classification accuracy\nwith novel viewpoints by about 10% points. For set anomaly detection on CelebA\ndataset, our model improves the areas under ROC and PR curves dataset by about\n22% and 10%, respectively. For the state prediction on CLEVR dataset, it\nimproves the AP by about 40%.",

Machine learning fairness has attracted increasing attention since\nmachine learning models are increasingly used for high-stakes and high-risk\ndecisions. Most existing solutions for machine learning fairness only target\none protected attribute(e.g. sex) at a time. These solutions cannot generate a\nmachine learning model which is fair against every protected attribute (e.g.\nboth sex and race) at the same time. To solve this problem, we propose\nFairBalance in this paper to balance the distribution of training data across\nevery protected attribute before training the machine learning models. Our\nresults show that, under the assumption of unbiased ground truth labels,\nFairBalance can significantly reduce bias metrics (AOD, EOD, and SPD) on every\nknown protected attribute without much, if not any damage to the prediction\nperformance.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have shown\nimpressive performance improvements on thermal to visible face synthesis and\nmatching problems. However, current DCNN-based synthesis models do not perform\nwell on thermal faces with large pose variations. In order to deal with this\nproblem, heterogeneous face frontalization methods are needed in which a model\ntakes a thermal profile face image and generates a frontal visible face. This\nis an extremely difficult problem due to the large domain as well as large pose\ndiscrepancies between the two modalities. Despite its applications in\nbiometrics and surveillance, this problem is relatively unexplored in the\nliterature. We propose a domain agnostic learning-based generative adversarial\nnetwork (DAL-GAN) which can synthesize frontal views in the visible domain from\nthermal faces with pose variations. DAL-GAN consists of a generator with an\nauxiliary classifier and two discriminators which capture both local and global\ntexture discriminations for better synthesis. A contrastive constraint is\nenforced in the latent space of the generator with the help of a dual-path\ntraining strategy, which improves the feature vector discrimination. Finally, a\nmulti-purpose loss function is utilized to guide the network in synthesizing\nidentity preserving cross-domain frontalization. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that DAL-GAN can generate better quality frontal views compared to\nthe other baseline methods.",

Recently, deep-learning-based end-to-end systems have\nshown promising results for autonomous driving/racing.

We validate our algorithm both in a\nhigh-fidelity driving simulation and on a real-world 1/20-scale RC-car with\nlimited onboard computation.

    "abstract": "Similar question retrieval is a core task in community-based question\nanswering (CQA) services. To balance the effectiveness and efficiency, the\nquestion retrieval system is typically implemented as multi-stage rankers: The\nfirst-stage ranker aims to recall potentially relevant questions from a large\nrepository, and the latter stages attempt to re-rank the retrieved results.\nMost existing works on question retrieval mainly focused on the re-ranking\nstages, leaving the first-stage ranker to some traditional term-based methods.\nHowever, term-based methods often suffer from the vocabulary mismatch problem,\nespecially on short texts, which may block the re-rankers from relevant\nquestions at the very beginning. An alternative is to employ embedding-based\nmethods for the first-stage ranker, which compress texts into dense vectors to\nenhance the semantic matching. However, these methods often lose the\ndiscriminative power as term-based methods, thus introduce noise during\nretrieval and hurt the recall performance. In this work, we aim to tackle the\ndilemma of the first-stage ranker, and propose a discriminative semantic\nranker, namely DenseTrans, for high-recall retrieval. Specifically, DenseTrans\nis a densely connected Transformer, which learns semantic embeddings for texts\nbased on Transformer layers. Meanwhile, DenseTrans promotes low-level features\nthrough dense connections to keep the discriminative power of the learned\nrepresentations. DenseTrans is inspired by DenseNet in computer vision (CV),\nbut poses a new way to use the dense connectivity which is totally different\nfrom its original design purpose. Experimental results over two question\nretrieval benchmark datasets show that our model can obtain significant gain on\nrecall against strong term-based methods as well as state-of-the-art\nembedding-based methods.",

Due to\nits local-search nature, however, theoretical guarantees on global optimality\noften rely on extra assumptions on the Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) that\nbypass the challenge of global exploration. To eliminate the need of such\nassumptions, in this work, we develop a general solution that adds dilated\nbonuses to the policy update to facilitate global exploration. To showcase the\npower and generality of this technique, we apply it to several episodic MDP\nsettings with adversarial losses and bandit feedback, improving and\ngeneralizing the state-of-the-art.

When a\nsimulator is unavailable, we further consider a linear MDP setting and obtain\n$\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}({T}^{14/15})$ regret, which is the first result for\nlinear MDPs with adversarial losses and bandit feedback.",

    "abstract": "Transcending the binary categorization of racist and xenophobic texts, this\nresearch takes cues from social science theories to develop a four dimensional\ncategory for racism and xenophobia detection, namely stigmatization,\noffensiveness, blame, and exclusion. With the aid of deep learning techniques,\nthis categorical detection enables insights into the nuances of emergent topics\nreflected in racist and xenophobic expression on Twitter. Moreover, a stage\nwise analysis is applied to capture the dynamic changes of the topics across\nthe stages of early development of Covid-19 from a domestic epidemic to an\ninternational public health emergency, and later to a global pandemic. The main\ncontributions of this research include, first the methodological advancement.\nBy bridging the state-of-the-art computational methods with social science\nperspective, this research provides a meaningful approach for future research\nto gain insight into the underlying subtlety of racist and xenophobic\ndiscussion on digital platforms. Second, by enabling a more accurate\ncomprehension and even prediction of public opinions and actions, this research\npaves the way for the enactment of effective intervention policies to combat\nracist crimes and social exclusion under Covid-19.",

The\ntypically large size of graphical data argues for the importance of designing\nuniversal compression methods for such data. In most applications, the\ngraphical data is sparse, meaning that the number of edges in the graph scales\nmore slowly than $n^2$, where $n$ denotes the number of vertices. Although in\nsome applications the number of edges scales linearly with $n$, in others the\nnumber of edges is much smaller than $n^2$ but appears to scale superlinearly\nwith $n$. We call the former sparse graphs and the latter heavy-tailed sparse\ngraphs. In this paper we introduce a universal lossless compression method\nwhich is simultaneously applicable to both classes.

    "abstract": "Fashion styles adopted every day are an important aspect of culture, and\nstyle trend analysis helps provide a deeper understanding of our societies and\ncultures. To analyze everyday fashion trends from the humanities perspective,\nwe need a digital archive that includes images of what people wore in their\ndaily lives over an extended period. In fashion research, building digital\nfashion image archives has attracted significant attention. However, the\nexisting archives are not suitable for retrieving everyday fashion trends. In\naddition, to interpret how the trends emerge, we need non-fashion data sources\nrelevant to why and how people choose fashion. In this study, we created a new\nfashion image archive called Chronicle Archive of Tokyo Street Fashion (CAT\nSTREET) based on a review of the limitations in the existing digital fashion\narchives. CAT STREET includes images showing the clothing people wore in their\ndaily lives during the period 1970--2017, which contain timestamps and street\nlocation annotations. We applied machine learning to CAT STREET and found two\ntypes of fashion trend patterns. Then, we demonstrated how magazine archives\nhelp us interpret how trend patterns emerge. These empirical analyses show our\napproach's potential to discover new perspectives to promote an understanding\nof our societies and cultures through fashion embedded in consumers' daily\nlives.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of post-hoc calibration for multiclass classification,\nwith an emphasis on histogram binning. Multiple works have focused on\ncalibration with respect to the confidence of just the predicted class (or\n'top-label'). We find that the popular notion of confidence calibration [Guo et\nal., 2017] is not sufficiently strong -- there exist predictors that are not\ncalibrated in any meaningful way but are perfectly confidence calibrated. We\npropose a closely related (but subtly different) notion, top-label calibration,\nthat accurately captures the intuition and simplicity of confidence\ncalibration, but addresses its drawbacks. We formalize a histogram binning (HB)\nalgorithm that reduces top-label multiclass calibration to the binary case,\nprove that it has clean theoretical guarantees without distributional\nassumptions, and perform a methodical study of its practical performance. Some\nprediction tasks require stricter notions of multiclass calibration such as\nclass-wise or canonical calibration. We formalize appropriate HB algorithms\ncorresponding to each of these goals. In experiments with deep neural nets, we\nfind that our principled versions of HB are often better than temperature\nscaling, for both top-label and class-wise calibration.

    "abstract": "Despite being a critical communication skill, grasping humor is challenging\n-- a successful use of humor requires a mixture of both engaging content\nbuild-up and an appropriate vocal delivery (e.g., pause). Prior studies on\ncomputational humor emphasize the textual and audio features immediately next\nto the punchline, yet overlooking longer-term context setup. Moreover, the\ntheories are usually too abstract for understanding each concrete humor\nsnippet. To fill in the gap, we develop DeHumor, a visual analytical system for\nanalyzing humorous behaviors in public speaking. To intuitively reveal the\nbuilding blocks of each concrete example, DeHumor decomposes each humorous\nvideo into multimodal features and provides inline annotations of them on the\nvideo script. In particular, to better capture the build-ups, we introduce\ncontent repetition as a complement to features introduced in theories of\ncomputational humor and visualize them in a context linking graph. To help\nusers locate the punchlines that have the desired features to learn, we\nsummarize the content (with keywords) and humor feature statistics on an\naugmented time matrix. With case studies on stand-up comedy shows and TED\ntalks, we show that DeHumor is able to highlight various building blocks of\nhumor examples. In addition, expert interviews with communication coaches and\nhumor researchers demonstrate the effectiveness of DeHumor for multimodal humor\nanalysis of speech content and vocal delivery.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive gradient methods, especially Adam-type methods (such as Adam,\nAMSGrad, and AdaBound), have been proposed to speed up the training process\nwith an element-wise scaling term on learning rates. However, they often\ngeneralize poorly compared with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its\naccelerated schemes such as SGD with momentum (SGDM). In this paper, we propose\na new adaptive method called DecGD, which simultaneously achieves good\ngeneralization like SGDM and obtain rapid convergence like Adam-type methods.\nIn particular, DecGD decomposes the current gradient into the product of two\nterms including a surrogate gradient and a loss based vector. Our method\nadjusts the learning rates adaptively according to the current loss based\nvector instead of the squared gradients used in Adam-type methods. The\nintuition for adaptive learning rates of DecGD is that a good optimizer, in\ngeneral cases, needs to decrease the learning rates as the loss decreases,\nwhich is similar to the learning rates decay scheduling technique. Therefore,\nDecGD gets a rapid convergence in the early phases of training and controls the\neffective learning rates according to the loss based vectors which help lead to\na better generalization. Convergence analysis is discussed in both convex and\nnon-convex situations. Finally, empirical results on widely-used tasks and\nmodels demonstrate that DecGD shows better generalization performance than SGDM\nand rapid convergence like Adam-type methods.",

How to efficiently allocate geographically distributed\nheterogeneous edge resources to a variety of services is a challenging task.\nWhile this problem has been studied extensively in recent years, most of the\nprevious work has largely ignored the preferences of the services when making\nedge resource allocation decisions. To this end, this paper introduces a novel\nbilevel optimization model, which explicitly takes the service preferences into\nconsideration, to study the interaction between an EC platform and multiple\nservices. The platform manages a set of edge nodes (ENs) and acts as the leader\nwhile the services are the followers.

By axially shifting\nchannels of the feature map, AS-MLP is able to obtain the information flow from\ndifferent axial directions, which captures the local dependencies. Such an\noperation enables us to utilize a pure MLP architecture to achieve the same\nlocal receptive field as CNN-like architecture. We can also design the\nreceptive field size and dilation of blocks of AS-MLP, etc, just like designing\nthose of convolution kernels. With the proposed AS-MLP architecture, our model\nobtains 83.3% Top-1 accuracy with 88M parameters and 15.2 GFLOPs on the\nImageNet-1K dataset. Such a simple yet effective architecture outperforms all\nMLP-based architectures and achieves competitive performance compared to the\ntransformer-based architectures (e.g., Swin Transformer) even with slightly\nlower FLOPs. In addition, AS-MLP is also the first MLP-based architecture to be\napplied to the downstream tasks (e.g., object detection and semantic\nsegmentation). The experimental results are also impressive.

Doing so avoids some pitfalls of bottom up approaches,\nincluding a dependence on hyper-parameter tuning and heuristic post-processing\npipelines to compensate for the inevitable variability in object sizes, even\nwithin a single scene. The representation capability of the network is greatly\nimproved by gathering homogeneous points that have identical semantic\ncategories and close votes for the geometric centroids. Instances are then\ndecoded via several simple convolution layers, where the parameters are\ngenerated conditioned on the input. The proposed approach is proposal-free, and\ninstead exploits a convolution process that adapts to the spatial and semantic\ncharacteristics of each instance. A light-weight transformer, built on the\nbottleneck layer, allows the model to capture long-range dependencies, with\nlimited computational overhead.

Several approaches have been proposed in the\nliterature, most of which require to transform the graphs into sequences that\nencode their structure and labels and to learn the distribution of such\nsequences through an auto-regressive generative model. Among this family of\napproaches, we focus on the GraphGen model. The preprocessing phase of GraphGen\ntransforms graphs into unique edge sequences called Depth-First Search (DFS)\ncodes, such that two isomorphic graphs are assigned the same DFS code. Each\nelement of a DFS code is associated with a graph edge: specifically, it is a\nquintuple comprising one node identifier for each of the two endpoints, their\nnode labels, and the edge label. GraphGen learns to generate such sequences\nauto-regressively and models the probability of each component of the quintuple\nindependently. While effective, the independence assumption made by the model\nis too loose to capture the complex label dependencies of real-world graphs\nprecisely. By introducing a novel graph preprocessing approach, we are able to\nprocess the labeling information of both nodes and edges jointly. The\ncorresponding model, which we term GraphGen-Redux, improves upon the generative\nperformances of GraphGen in a wide range of datasets of chemical and social\ngraphs.

There exist different\nentropy measures in the literature to analyze the predictability and complexity\nof time series. However, these measures have some drawbacks especially in short\ntime series. To overcome the difficulties, this paper proposes a new method for\nestimating the entropy of a time series using the LogNNet 784:25:10 neural\nnetwork model. The LogNNet reservoir matrix consists of 19625 elements which is\nfilled with the time series elements.

A more complex\ntransformation of the input information by the time series in the reservoir\nleads to higher NNetEn values. Many practical time series data have less than\n19625 elements. Some duplicating or stretching methods are investigated to\novercome this difficulty and the most successful method is identified for\npractical applications. The epochs number in the training process of LogNNet is\nconsidered as the input parameter.

We perform a detailed study of our framework to demonstrate how our\nmodel outperforms all existing agents on the popular game, Zork1, to achieve a\nscore of 44.7, which is 1.6 higher than the state-of-the-art model. Our\nproposed approach also performs comparably to the state-of-the-art models on\nthe other set of text games.",

Specialised\ntreatment of AC axioms is mainly supported by provers for unit equality which\nare based on Knuth-Bendix completion. The main ingredient for dealing with AC\nin these provers are ground joinability criteria adapted for AC.\nIn this paper we extend AC joinability from the context of unit equalities\nand Knuth-Bendix completion to the superposition calculus and full first-order\nlogic. Our approach is based on an extension of the Bachmair-Ganzinger model\nconstruction and a new redundancy criterion which covers ground joinability. A\nby-product of our approach is a new criterion for applicability of demodulation\nwhich we call encompassment demodulation. This criterion is useful in any\nsuperposition theorem prover, independently of AC theories, and we demonstrate\nthat it enables demodulation in many more cases, compared to the standard\ncriterion.",

    "abstract": "Tissue deformation in ultrasound (US) imaging leads to geometrical errors\nwhen measuring tissues due to the pressure exerted by probes. Such deformation\nhas an even larger effect on 3D US volumes as the correct compounding is\nlimited by the inconsistent location and geometry. This work proposes a\npatient-specified stiffness-based method to correct the tissue deformations in\nrobotic 3D US acquisitions. To obtain the patient-specified model, robotic\npalpation is performed at sampling positions on the tissue. The contact force,\nUS images and the probe poses of the palpation procedure are recorded. The\ncontact force and the probe poses are used to estimate the nonlinear tissue\nstiffness. The images are fed to an optical flow algorithm to compute the pixel\ndisplacement. Then the pixel-wise tissue deformation under different forces is\ncharacterized by a coupled quadratic regression. To correct the deformation at\nunseen positions on the trajectory for building 3D volumes, an interpolation is\nperformed based on the stiffness values computed at the sampling positions.\nWith the stiffness and recorded force, the tissue displacement could be\ncorrected. The method was validated on two blood vessel phantoms with different\nstiffness. The results demonstrate that the method can effectively correct the\nforce-induced deformation and finally generate 3D tissue geometries",

However, they can be\nadversely affected by VR sickness (VRS) symptoms. VRS can be minimized by\nmanipulating users' perception of the virtual environment via the head-mounted\ndisplay (HMD). One extreme example is the Teleport mitigation technique, which\nlets users navigate discretely, skipping sections of the virtual space. Other\ntechniques are less extreme but still rely on controlling what and how much\nusers see via the HMD. This research examines the effect on players'\nperformance and gameplay of these mitigation techniques in fast-paced VR games.\nOur focus is on two types of visual reduction techniques. This study aims to\nidentify specifically the trade-offs these techniques have in a first-person\nshooter game regarding immersion, performance, and VRS. The main contributions\nin this paper are (1) a deeper understanding of one of the most popular\ntechniques (Teleport) when it comes to gameplay; (2) the replication and\nvalidation of a novel VRS mitigation technique based on visual reduction; and\n(3) a comparison of their effect on players' performance and gameplay.",

However, randomness can affect the game experience depending on when it\noccurs in a game, altering the chances of planning for a player. In this paper,\nwe refer to it as \"input-output randomness\". Input-output randomness is a\ncornerstone of collectable card games like Hearthstone, in which cards are\ndrawn randomly (input randomness) and have random effects when played (output\nrandomness). While the topic might have been commonly discussed by game\ndesigners and be present in many games, few empirical studies have been\nperformed to evaluate the effects of these different kinds of randomness on the\nplayers' satisfaction. This research investigates the effects of input-output\nrandomness on collectable card games across four input-output randomness\nconditions. We have developed our own collectable card game and experimented\nwith the different kinds of randomness with the game.

    "abstract": "Driven by the games community, virtual reality setups have lately evolved\ninto affordable and consumer-ready mobile headsets. However, despite these\npromising improvements, it remains challenging to convey immersive and engaging\nVR games as players are usually limited to experience the virtual world by\nvision and hearing only. One prominent example of such open challenges is the\ndisparity between the real surroundings and the virtual environment. As virtual\nobstacles usually do not have a physical counterpart, players might walk\nthrough walls enclosing the level. Thus, past research mainly focussed on\nmultisensory collision feedback to deter players from ignoring obstacles.\nHowever, the underlying causative reasons for such unwanted behavior have\nmostly remained unclear.\nOur work investigates how task types and wall appearances influence the\nplayers' incentives to walk through virtual walls. Therefore, we conducted a\nuser study, confronting the participants with different task motivations and\nwalls of varying opacity and realism. Our evaluation reveals that players\ngenerally adhere to realistic behavior, as long as the experience feels\ninteresting and diverse. Furthermore, we found that opaque walls excel in\ndeterring subjects from cutting short, whereas different degrees of realism had\nno significant influence on walking trajectories. Finally, we use collected\nplayer feedback to discuss individual reasons for the observed behavior.",

    "abstract": "Sleep staging assumes an important role in the diagnosis of sleep disorders.\nIn general, experts classify sleep stages manually based on polysomnography\n(PSG), which is quite time-consuming. Meanwhile, the acquisition of multiple\nsignals is complex, which can affect the subject's sleep. Therefore, the use of\nsingle-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) for automatic sleep staging has\nbecome mainstream. In the literature, a large number of sleep staging methods\nbased on single-channel EEG have been proposed with good results and realize\nthe preliminary automation of sleep staging. However, the performance for most\nof these methods in the N1 stage is generally not high. In this paper, we\npropose a deep learning model SDAN based on raw EEG. The method utilises a\none-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically extract\nfeatures from raw EEG. It serially combines the channel attention and spatial\nattention mechanisms to filter and highlight key information and then uses soft\nthreshold to eliminate redundant information. Additionally, we introduce a\nresidual network to avoid degradation problems caused by network deepening.\nExperiments were conducted using two datasets with 5-fold cross-validation and\nhold-out validation method. The final average accuracy, overall accuracy, macro\nF1 score and Cohen's Kappa coefficient of the model reach 96.74%, 91.86%,\n82.64% and 0.8742 on the Sleep-EDF dataset, and 95.98%, 89.96%, 79.08% and\n0.8216 on the Sleep-EDFx dataset.

    "abstract": "We extend the theory of PAC learning in a way which allows to model a rich\nvariety of learning tasks where the data satisfy special properties that ease\nthe learning process. For example, tasks where the distance of the data from\nthe decision boundary is bounded away from zero. The basic and simple idea is\nto consider partial concepts: these are functions that can be undefined on\ncertain parts of the space. When learning a partial concept, we assume that the\nsource distribution is supported only on points where the partial concept is\ndefined.\nThis way, one can naturally express assumptions on the data such as lying on\na lower dimensional surface or margin conditions. In contrast, it is not at all\nclear that such assumptions can be expressed by the traditional PAC theory. In\nfact we exhibit easy-to-learn partial concept classes which provably cannot be\ncaptured by the traditional PAC theory. This also resolves a question posed by\nAttias, Kontorovich, and Mansour 2019.\nWe characterize PAC learnability of partial concept classes and reveal an\nalgorithmic landscape which is fundamentally different than the classical one.\nFor example, in the classical PAC model, learning boils down to Empirical Risk\nMinimization (ERM). In stark contrast, we show that the ERM principle fails in\nexplaining learnability of partial concept classes. In fact, we demonstrate\nclasses that are incredibly easy to learn, but such that any algorithm that\nlearns them must use an hypothesis space with unbounded VC dimension. We also\nfind that the sample compression conjecture fails in this setting.\nThus, this theory features problems that cannot be represented nor solved in\nthe traditional way. We view this as evidence that it might provide insights on\nthe nature of learnability in realistic scenarios which the classical theory\nfails to explain.",

    "abstract": "In many inference problems, the evaluation of complex and costly models is\noften required. In this context, Bayesian methods have become very popular in\nseveral fields over the last years, in order to obtain parameter inversion,\nmodel selection or uncertainty quantification. Bayesian inference requires the\napproximation of complicated integrals involving (often costly) posterior\ndistributions. Generally, this approximation is obtained by means of Monte\nCarlo (MC) methods. In order to reduce the computational cost of the\ncorresponding technique, surrogate models (also called emulators) are often\nemployed. Another alternative approach is the so-called Approximate Bayesian\nComputation (ABC) scheme. ABC does not require the evaluation of the costly\nmodel but the ability to simulate artificial data according to that model.\nMoreover, in ABC, the choice of a suitable distance between real and artificial\ndata is also required. In this work, we introduce a novel approach where the\nexpensive model is evaluated only in some well-chosen samples. The selection of\nthese nodes is based on the so-called compressed Monte Carlo (CMC) scheme. We\nprovide theoretical results supporting the novel algorithms and give empirical\nevidence of the performance of the proposed method in several numerical\nexperiments. Two of them are real-world applications in astronomy and satellite\nremote sensing.",

The algorithm solves a set of global optimization (Go)\nproblems over a given time horizon to construct a tight enclosure (Tube) of the\nset of all process executions starting from a ball of initial states. We call\nour algorithm GoTube. Through its construction, GoTube ensures that the\nbounding tube is conservative up to a desired probability. GoTube is\nimplemented in JAX and optimized to scale to complex continuous-depth models.\nCompared to advanced reachability analysis tools for time-continuous neural\nnetworks, GoTube provably does not accumulate over-approximation errors between\ntime steps and avoids the infamous wrapping effect inherent in symbolic\ntechniques. We show that GoTube substantially outperforms state-of-the-art\nverification tools in terms of the size of the initial ball, speed,\ntime-horizon, task completion, and scalability, on a large set of experiments.\nGoTube is stable and sets the state-of-the-art for its ability to scale up to\ntime horizons well beyond what has been possible before.",

However, the same\noperations over fields with no smooth order root of unity suffer from an\nasymptotic slowdown. The classical algorithm of Schonhage and Strassen incurred\na multiplicative slowdown factor of $\\log \\log n$ on top of the smooth case.\nRecent remarkable results of Harvey, van der Hoeven and Lecerf dramatically\nreduced this multiplicative overhead to $\\exp(\\log^* (n))$.\nWe introduce a new approach to fast algorithms for polynomial operations over\nall large finite fields. The key idea is to replace the group of roots of unity\nwith a set of points $L \\subset F$ suitably related to a well-chosen elliptic\ncurve group (the set $L$ itself is not a group). The key advantage of this\napproach is that elliptic curve groups can be of any size in the Hasse-Weil\ninterval $[q+1 \\pm 2\\sqrt{q}]$ and thus can have subgroups of large, smooth\norder, which an FFT-like divide and conquer algorithm can exploit. Compare this\nwith multiplicative subgroups over whose order must divide $q-1$.\nFor polynomials represented by their evaluation over subsets of $L$, we show\nthat multiplication, division, degree-computation, interpolation, evaluation\nand Reed-Solomon encoding (also known as low-degree extension) with fixed\nevaluation points can all be computed with arithmetic circuits of size similar\nto what is achievable with the classical FFTs when the field size is special.\nFor several problems, this yields the asymptotically smallest known arithmetic\ncircuits even in the standard monomial representation of polynomials.",

The necessity to maintain network connectivity\nincreases costs, introduces cybersecurity risks, and significantly limits the\nnumber of places where the terminals can be installed. Leading payment service\nproviders have proposed offline payment solutions that rely on algorithmically\ngenerated payment tokens.

We design a novel payment protocol which mitigates security\nthreats for all the participants of VolgaPay, such that the maximum loss from\ngaining full access to any component by an adversary incurs only a limited\nscope of harm.

Furthermore, the\ncommunication takes place in the presence of untrusted external receivers,\ni.e., eavesdropper nodes. The communicated uplink (UL) and downlink (DL)\nwaveforms are quantized in order to comply with the limited capacity of the\nfronthaul links. In order to provide information secrecy, we propose a novel\nutilization of the quantization noise shaping in the DL, such that it is\nsimultaneously used to comply with the limited capacity of the fronthaul links,\nas well as to degrade decoding capability of the individual eavesdropper and\nthe untrusted RUs for both the UL and DL communications. In this regard,\nexpressions describing the achievable secrecy rates are obtained. An\noptimization problem for jointly designing the DL and UL quantization and\nprecoding strategies are then formulated, with the purpose of maximizing the\noverall system weighted sum secrecy rate. Due to the intractability of the\nformulated problem, an iterative solution is proposed, following the successive\ninner approximation and semi-definite relaxation frameworks, with convergence\nto a stationary point.

This motivates us to study heterogeneous Coded Storage Elastic\nComputing (CSEC) systems where machines, with different computing speeds, join\nand leave the network arbitrarily over different computing steps. In CSEC\nsystems, a Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) code is used for coded storage such\nthat the file placement does not have to be redefined with each elastic event.\nComputation assignment algorithms are used to minimize the computation time\ngiven computation speeds of different machines. While previous studies of\nheterogeneous CSEC do not include stragglers-the slow machines during the\ncomputation, we develop a new framework in heterogeneous CSEC that introduces\nstraggler tolerance. Based on this framework, we design a novel algorithm using\nour previously proposed approach for heterogeneous CSEC such that the system\ncan handle any subset of stragglers of a specified size while minimizing the\ncomputation time. Furthermore, we establish a trade-off in computation time and\nstraggler tolerance. Another major limitation of existing CSEC designs is the\nlack of practical evaluations using real applications.

GPUs are an expensive\nresource, and boosting utilization of GPUs without causing performance\ndegradation of individual workloads is an important and challenging problem.\nAlthough services like MPS support simultaneous execution of multiple\nco-operative kernels on a single device, they do not solve the above problem\nfor uncooperative kernels, MPS being oblivious to the resource needs of each\nkernel.\nWe propose a fully automated compiler-assisted scheduling framework. The\ncompiler constructs GPU tasks by identifying kernel launches and their related\nGPU operations (e.g. memory allocations). For each GPU task, a probe is\ninstrumented in the host-side code right before its launch point. At runtime,\nthe probe conveys the information about the task's resource requirements (e.g.\nmemory and compute cores) to a scheduler, such that the scheduler can place the\ntask on an appropriate device based on the task's resource requirements and\ndevices' load in a memory-safe, resource-aware manner. To demonstrate its\nadvantages, we prototyped a throughput-oriented scheduler based on the\nframework, and evaluated it with the Rodinia benchmark suite and the Darknet\nneural network framework on NVIDIA GPUs. The results show that the proposed\nsolution outperforms existing state-of-the-art solutions by leveraging its\nknowledge about applications' multiple resource requirements, which include\nmemory as well as SMs. It improves throughput by up to 2.5x for Rodinia\nbenchmarks, and up to 2.7x for Darknet neural networks. In addition, it\nimproves job turnaround time by up to 4.9x, and limits individual kernel\nperformance degradation to at most 2.5%.",

    "abstract": "We study distributed planning for multi-robot systems to provide optimal\nservice to cooperative tasks that are distributed over space and time. Each\ntask requires service by sufficiently many robots at the specified location\nwithin the specified time window. Tasks arrive over episodes and the robots try\nto maximize the total value of service in each episode by planning their own\ntrajectories based on the specifications of incoming tasks. Robots are required\nto start and end each episode at their assigned stations in the environment. We\npresent a game theoretic solution to this problem by mapping it to a game,\nwhere the action of each robot is its trajectory in an episode, and using a\nsuitable learning algorithm to obtain optimal joint plans in a distributed\nmanner. We present a systematic way to design minimal action sets (subsets of\nfeasible trajectories) for robots based on the specifications of incoming tasks\nto facilitate fast learning. We then provide the performance guarantees for the\ncases where all the robots follow a best response or noisy best response\nalgorithm to iteratively plan their trajectories. While the best response\nalgorithm leads to a Nash equilibrium, the noisy best response algorithm leads\nto globally optimal joint plans with high probability. We show that the\nproposed game can in general have arbitrarily poor Nash equilibria, which makes\nthe noisy best response algorithm preferable unless the task specifications are\nknown to have some special structure. We also describe a family of special\ncases where all the equilibria are guaranteed to have bounded suboptimality.\nSimulations and experimental results are provided to demonstrate the proposed\napproach.",

    "abstract": "Fuzzy graph-based structures such as fuzzy automata, fuzzy labeled transition\nsystems, fuzzy Kripke models, fuzzy social networks and fuzzy interpretations\nin fuzzy description logics are useful in various applications. Given two\nstates, two actors or two individuals $x$ and $x'$ in such structures $G$ and\n$G'$, respectively, the similarity degree between them can be defined to be\n$Z(x,x')$, where $Z$ is the greatest fuzzy bisimulation between $G$ and $G'$\nw.r.t. some t-norm-based fuzzy logic. Such a similarity measure has the\nHennessy-Milner property of fuzzy bisimulations as a strong logical foundation.\nA fuzzy bisimulation between a fuzzy structure $G$ and itself is called a fuzzy\nauto-bisimulation of $G$. The greatest fuzzy auto-bisimulation of an\nimage-finite fuzzy graph-based structure is a fuzzy equivalence relation.

    "abstract": "In multi-robot multi-target tracking, robots coordinate to monitor groups of\ntargets moving about an environment. We approach planning for such scenarios by\nformulating a receding-horizon, multi-robot sensing problem with a mutual\ninformation objective. Such problems are NP-Hard in general. Yet, our objective\nis submodular which enables certain greedy planners to guarantee\nconstant-factor suboptimality. However, these greedy planners require robots to\nplan their actions in sequence, one robot at a time, so planning time is at\nleast proportional to the number of robots. Solving these problems becomes\nintractable for large teams, even for distributed implementations. Our prior\nwork proposed a distributed planner (RSP) which reduces this number of\nsequential steps to a constant, even for large numbers of robots, by allowing\nrobots to plan in parallel while ignoring some of each others' decisions.\nAlthough that analysis is not applicable to target tracking, we prove a similar\nguarantee, that RSP planning approaches performance guarantees for fully\nsequential planners, by employing a novel bound which takes advantage of the\nindependence of target motions to quantify effective redundancy between robots'\nobservations and actions. Further, we present analysis that explicitly accounts\nfor features of practical implementations including approximations to the\nobjective and anytime planning. Simulation results -- available via open source\nrelease -- for target tracking with ranging sensors demonstrate that our\nplanners consistently approach the performance of sequential planning (in terms\nof position uncertainty) given only 2--8 planning steps and for as many as 96\nrobots with a 24x reduction in the number of sequential steps in planning.\nThus, this work makes planning for multi-robot target tracking tractable at\nmuch larger scales than before, for practical planners and general tracking\nproblems.",

However, two\ncritical issues have been overlooked. First, the accumulative error, inflicted\nby learning with noisy clustering assignments, degrades the effectiveness and\nrobustness of the clustering model. This problem is called Feature Randomness.\nSecond, reconstructing the adjacency matrix sets the model to learn irrelevant\nsimilarities for the clustering task. This problem is called Feature Drift.\nInterestingly, the theoretical relation between the aforementioned problems has\nnot yet been investigated. We study these issues from two aspects: (1) the\nexistence of a trade-off between Feature Randomness and Feature Drift when\nclustering and reconstruction are performed at the same level, and (2) the\nproblem of Feature Drift is more pronounced for GAE models, compared with\nvanilla auto-encoder models, due to the graph convolutional operation and the\ngraph decoding design. Motivated by these findings, we reformulate the\nGAE-based clustering methodology. Our solution is two-fold. First, we propose a\nsampling operator $\\Xi$ that triggers a protection mechanism against the noisy\nclustering assignments.

The modulation function is jointly learned with the main task using\na multi-layer perceptron.

    "abstract": "Despite recent success in machine reading comprehension (MRC), learning\nhigh-quality MRC models still requires large-scale labeled training data, even\nusing strong pre-trained language models (PLMs). The pre-training tasks for\nPLMs are not question-answering or MRC-based tasks, making existing PLMs unable\nto be directly used for unsupervised MRC. Specifically, MRC aims to spot an\naccurate answer span from the given document, but PLMs focus on token filling\nin sentences. In this paper, we propose a new framework for unsupervised MRC.\nFirstly, we propose to learn to spot answer spans in documents via\nself-supervised learning, by designing a self-supervision pretext task for MRC\n- Spotting-MLM. Solving this task requires capturing deep interactions between\nsentences in documents. Secondly, we apply a simple sentence rewriting strategy\nin the inference stage to alleviate the expression mismatch between questions\nand documents. Experiments show that our method achieves a new state-of-the-art\nperformance for unsupervised MRC.",

Existing solutions either restrict the number of users to\nunder-approximate behaviour, or rely on manual proofs. In this paper, we\npresent local bundles that reduce contracts with arbitrarily many users to\nsequential programs with a few representative users. Each representative user\nabstracts concrete users that are locally symmetric to each other relative to\nthe contract and the property. Our abstraction is semi-automated. The\nrepresentatives depend on communication patterns, and are computed via static\nanalysis. A summary for the behaviour of each representative is provided\nmanually, but a default summary is often sufficient. Once obtained, a local\nbundle is amenable to sequential static analysis. We show that local bundles\nare relatively complete for parameterized safety verification, under moderate\nassumptions.

    "abstract": "The current standard for a variety of computer vision tasks using smaller\nnumbers of labelled training examples is to fine-tune from weights pre-trained\non a large image classification dataset such as ImageNet. The application of\ntransfer learning and transfer learning methods tends to be rigidly binary. A\nmodel is either pre-trained or not pre-trained. Pre-training a model either\nincreases performance or decreases it, the latter being defined as negative\ntransfer. Application of L2-SP regularisation that decays the weights towards\ntheir pre-trained values is either applied or all weights are decayed towards\n0. This paper re-examines these assumptions. Our recommendations are based on\nextensive empirical evaluation that demonstrate the application of a non-binary\napproach to achieve optimal results. (1) Achieving best performance on each\nindividual dataset requires careful adjustment of various transfer learning\nhyperparameters not usually considered, including number of layers to transfer,\ndifferent learning rates for different layers and different combinations of\nL2SP and L2 regularization. (2) Best practice can be achieved using a number of\nmeasures of how well the pre-trained weights fit the target dataset to guide\noptimal hyperparameters. We present methods for non-binary transfer learning\nincluding combining L2SP and L2 regularization and performing non-traditional\nfine-tuning hyperparameter searches. Finally we suggest heuristics for\ndetermining the optimal transfer learning hyperparameters. The benefits of\nusing a non-binary approach are supported by final results that come close to\nor exceed state of the art performance on a variety of tasks that have\ntraditionally been more difficult for transfer learning.",

    "abstract": "High-quality labels are expensive to obtain for many machine learning tasks,\nsuch as medical image classification tasks. Therefore, probabilistic (weak)\nlabels produced by weak supervision tools are used to seed a process in which\ninfluential samples with weak labels are identified and cleaned by several\nhuman annotators to improve the model performance. To lower the overall cost\nand computational overhead of this process, we propose a solution called\nChef(CHEap and Fast label cleaning), which consists of the following three\ncomponents. First, to reduce the cost of human annotators, we use Infl, which\nprioritizes the most influential training samples for cleaning and provides\ncleaned labels to save the cost of one human annotator. Second, to accelerate\nthe sample selector phase and the model constructor phase, we use Increm-Infl\nto incrementally produce influential samples, and DeltaGrad-L to incrementally\nupdate the model. Third, we redesign the typical label cleaning pipeline so\nthat human annotators iteratively clean smaller batch of samples rather than\none big batch of samples. This yields better over all model performance and\nenables possible early termination when the expected model performance has been\nachieved.

Compact segmentation networks\nare more widely used in the case of limited resources, while their performances\nare constrained. In this paper, motivated by the residual learning and global\naggregation, we propose a simple yet general and effective knowledge\ndistillation framework called double similarity distillation (DSD) to improve\nthe classification accuracy of all existing compact networks by capturing the\nsimilarity knowledge in pixel and category dimensions, respectively.\nSpecifically, we propose a pixel-wise similarity distillation (PSD) module that\nutilizes residual attention maps to capture more detailed spatial dependencies\nacross multiple layers.

Furthermore,\nconsidering the differences in characteristics between semantic segmentation\ntask and other computer vision tasks, we propose a category-wise similarity\ndistillation (CSD) module, which can help the compact segmentation network\nstrengthen the global category correlation by constructing the correlation\nmatrix. Combining these two modules, DSD framework has no extra parameters and\nonly a minimal increase in FLOPs.

Industrial ensemble models are typically\ndeep neural networks, following the supervised learning paradigm to infer\nconversion rate given inputs from sub-models.

Firstly, the point-wise scoring approach disregards the\nrelationships between items and leads to homogeneous displayed results, while\ndiversified display benefits user experience and revenue. Secondly, the\nlearning paradigm focuses on the ranking metrics and does not directly optimize\nthe revenue.

This notion enables one to measure the\nrobustness of compression algorithms in terms of errors and/or dynamic changes\noccurring in the input string. In this paper, we analyze the worst-case\nmultiplicative sensitivity of string compression algorithms, defined by\n$\\max_{T \\in \\Sigma^n}\\{C(T')/C(T) : ed(T, T') = 1\\}$, where $ed(T, T')$\ndenotes the edit distance between $T$ and $T'$. For the most common versions of\nthe Lempel-Ziv 77 compressors, we prove that the worst-case multiplicative\nsensitivity is only a small constant (2 or 3, depending on the version of the\nLempel-Ziv 77 and the edit operation type). We strengthen our upper bound\nresults by presenting matching lower bounds on the worst-case sensitivity for\nall these major versions of the Lempel-Ziv 77 factorizations. This contrasts\nwith the previously known related results such that the size $z_{\\rm 78}$ of\nthe Lempel-Ziv 78 factorization can increase by a factor of $\\Omega(n^{3/4})$\n[Lagarde and Perifel, 2018], and the number $r$ of runs in the Burrows-Wheeler\ntransform can increase by a factor of $\\Omega(\\log n)$ [Giuliani et al., 2021]\nwhen a character is prepended to an input string of length $n$. We also study\nthe worst-case sensitivity of several grammar compression algorithms including\nBisection, AVL-grammar, GCIS, and CDAWG. Further, we extend the notion of the\nworst-case sensitivity to string repetitiveness measures such as the smallest\nstring attractor size $\\gamma$ and the substring complexity $\\delta$, and\npresent matching upper and lower bounds of the worst-case multiplicative\nsensitivity for $\\gamma$ and $\\delta$.",

To address this issue, we suggest a\nperception-aware path planner which utilizes topological information of\nenvironments. Since the topological class of a path and visible landmarks\nduring traveling the path are closely related, the proposed algorithm checks\ndistinctive topological classes to choose the class with abundant visual\ninformation.

To evaluate the perception quality of the classes, we divide the\ninitial path into discrete segments where the points in each segment share\nsimilar visual information. The optimal class with high perception quality is\nselected, and a graph-based planner is utilized to generate path within the\nclass.

    "abstract": "The increasingly complicated and diverse applications have distinct network\nperformance demands, e.g., some desire high throughput while others require low\nlatency. Traditional congestion controls (CC) have no perception of these\ndemands. Consequently, literatures have explored the objective-specific\nalgorithms, which are based on either offline training or online learning, to\nadapt to certain application demands. However, once generated, such algorithms\nare tailored to a specific performance objective function. Newly emerged\nperformance demands in a changeable network environment require either\nexpensive retraining (in the case of offline training), or manually redesigning\na new objective function (in the case of online learning). To address this\nproblem, we propose a novel architecture, DeepCC. It generates a CC agent that\nis generically applicable to a wide range of application requirements and\nnetwork conditions. The key idea of DeepCC is to leverage both offline deep\nreinforcement learning and online fine-tuning. In the offline phase, instead of\ntraining towards a specific objective function, DeepCC trains its deep neural\nnetwork model using multi-objective optimization. With the trained model,\nDeepCC offers near Pareto optimal policies w.r.t different user-specified\ntrade-offs between throughput, delay, and loss rate without any redesigning or\nretraining. In addition, a quick online fine-tuning phase further helps DeepCC\nachieve the application-specific demands under dynamic network conditions. The\nsimulation and real-world experiments show that DeepCC outperforms\nstate-of-the-art schemes in a wide range of settings.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we develop face.evoLVe -- a comprehensive library that\ncollects and implements a wide range of popular deep learning-based methods for\nface recognition. First of all, face.evoLVe is composed of key components that\ncover the full process of face analytics, including face alignment, data\nprocessing, various backbones, losses, and alternatives with bags of tricks for\nimproving performance. Later, face.evoLVe supports multi-GPU training on top of\ndifferent deep learning platforms, such as PyTorch and PaddlePaddle, which\nfacilitates researchers to work on both large-scale datasets with millions of\nimages and low-shot counterparts with limited well-annotated data. More\nimportantly, along with face.evoLVe, images before & after alignment in the\ncommon benchmark datasets are released with source codes and trained models\nprovided. All these efforts lower the technical burdens in reproducing the\nexisting methods for comparison, while users of our library could focus on\ndeveloping advanced approaches more efficiently. Last but not least,\nface.evoLVe is well designed and vibrantly evolving, so that new face\nrecognition approaches can be easily plugged into our framework. Note that we\nhave used face.evoLVe to participate in a number of face recognition\ncompetitions and secured the first place. The version that supports PyTorch is\npublicly available at https://github.com/ZhaoJ9014/face.evoLVe.PyTorch and the\nPaddlePaddle version is available at\nhttps://github.com/ZhaoJ9014/face.evoLVe.PyTorch/tree/master/paddle.\nFace.evoLVe has been widely used for face analytics, receiving 2.4K stars and\n622 forks.",

    "abstract": "Medical image segmentation plays an essential role in developing\ncomputer-assisted diagnosis and therapy systems, yet still faces many\nchallenges. In the past few years, the popular encoder-decoder architectures\nbased on CNNs (e.g., U-Net) have been successfully applied in the task of\nmedical image segmentation. However, due to the locality of convolution\noperations, they demonstrate limitations in learning global context and\nlong-range spatial relations. Recently, several researchers try to introduce\ntransformers to both the encoder and decoder components with promising results,\nbut the efficiency requires further improvement due to the high computational\ncomplexity of transformers. In this paper, we propose LeViT-UNet, which\nintegrates a LeViT Transformer module into the U-Net architecture, for fast and\naccurate medical image segmentation. Specifically, we use LeViT as the encoder\nof the LeViT-UNet, which better trades off the accuracy and efficiency of the\nTransformer block. Moreover, multi-scale feature maps from transformer blocks\nand convolutional blocks of LeViT are passed into the decoder via\nskip-connection, which can effectively reuse the spatial information of the\nfeature maps. Our experiments indicate that the proposed LeViT-UNet achieves\nbetter performance comparing to various competing methods on several\nchallenging medical image segmentation benchmarks including Synapse and ACDC.\nCode and models will be publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/apple1986/LeViT_UNet.",

As these devices are\nbecoming a part of citizens' everyday arsenal, concerns over the residents'\nprivacy are progressing. Therefore, this paper presents SASSL, a secure aerial\nsurveillance drone using split learning to classify whether there is a presence\nof a fire on the streets. This innovative split learning method transfers CCTV\nfootage captured with a drone to a nearby server to run a deep neural network\nto detect a fire's presence in real-time without exposing the original data. We\ndevise a scenario where surveillance UAVs roam around the suburb, recording any\nunnatural behavior. The UAV can process the recordings through its on-mobile\ndeep neural network system or transfer the information to a server. Due to the\nresource limitations of mobile UAVs, the UAV does not have the capacity to run\nan entire deep neural network on its own. This is where the split learning\nmethod comes in handy. The UAV runs the deep neural network only up to the\nfirst hidden layer and sends only the feature map to the cloud server, where\nthe rest of the deep neural network is processed. By ensuring that the learning\nprocess is divided between the UAV and the server, the privacy of raw data is\nsecured while the UAV does not overexert its minimal resources.",

Moreover, to facilitate future researches in this\nfield, we introduce a large-scale crowded video benchmark named SenseCrowd,\nwhich consists of 60K+ frames captured in various surveillance scenarios and\n2M+ head annotations.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised learning algorithms (e.g., self-supervised learning,\nauto-encoder, contrastive learning) allow deep learning models to learn\neffective image representations from large-scale unlabeled data. In medical\nimage analysis, even unannotated data can be difficult to obtain for individual\nlabs. Fortunately, national-level efforts have been made to provide efficient\naccess to obtain biomedical image data from previous scientific publications.\nFor instance, NIH has launched the Open-i search engine that provides a\nlarge-scale image database with free access. However, the images in scientific\npublications consist of a considerable amount of compound figures with\nsubplots. To extract and curate individual subplots, many different compound\nfigure separation approaches have been developed, especially with the recent\nadvances in deep learning. However, previous approaches typically required\nresource extensive bounding box annotation to train detection models. In this\npaper, we propose a simple compound figure separation (SimCFS) framework that\nuses weak classification annotations from individual images. Our technical\ncontribution is three-fold: (1) we introduce a new side loss that is designed\nfor compound figure separation; (2) we introduce an intra-class image\naugmentation method to simulate hard cases; (3) the proposed framework enables\nan efficient deployment to new classes of images, without requiring resource\nextensive bounding box annotations. From the results, the SimCFS achieved a new\nstate-of-the-art performance on the ImageCLEF 2016 Compound Figure Separation\nDatabase.

    "abstract": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are emerging machine learning models\nfor generating synthesized data similar to real data by jointly training a\ngenerator and a discriminator. In many applications, data and computational\nresources are distributed over many devices, so centralized computation with\nall data in one location is infeasible due to privacy and/or communication\nconstraints. This paper proposes a new framework for training GANs in a\ndistributed fashion: Each device computes a local discriminator using local\ndata; a single server aggregates their results and computes a global GAN.\nSpecifically, in each iteration, the server sends the global GAN to the\ndevices, which then update their local discriminators; the devices send their\nresults to the server, which then computes their average as the global\ndiscriminator and updates the global generator accordingly. Two different\nupdate schedules are designed with different levels of parallelism between the\ndevices and the server. Numerical results obtained using three popular datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed framework can outperform a state-of-the-art\nframework in terms of convergence speed.",

    "abstract": "In multi-modal dialogue systems, it is important to allow the use of images\nas part of a multi-turn conversation. Training such dialogue systems generally\nrequires a large-scale dataset consisting of multi-turn dialogues that involve\nimages, but such datasets rarely exist. In response, this paper proposes a 45k\nmulti-modal dialogue dataset created with minimal human intervention. Our\nmethod to create such a dataset consists of (1) preparing and pre-processing\ntext dialogue datasets, (2) creating image-mixed dialogues by using a\ntext-to-image replacement technique, and (3) employing a\ncontextual-similarity-based filtering step to ensure the contextual coherence\nof the dataset. To evaluate the validity of our dataset, we devise a simple\nretrieval model for dialogue sentence prediction tasks. Automatic metrics and\nhuman evaluation results on such tasks show that our dataset can be effectively\nused as training data for multi-modal dialogue systems which require an\nunderstanding of images and text in a context-aware manner.

In this paper, we investigate the excess risk performance\nand towards improved learning rates for two popular approaches of stochastic\noptimization: empirical risk minimization (ERM) and stochastic gradient descent\n(SGD).

Motivated\nby these problems, we aim to provide improved rates under milder assumptions in\nconvex learning and derive faster rates in nonconvex learning. It is notable\nthat our analysis span two popular theoretical viewpoints: stability and\nuniform convergence. To be specific, in stability regime, we present high\nprobability rates of order $\\mathcal{O} (1/n)$ w.r.t. the sample size $n$ for\nERM and SGD with milder assumptions in convex learning and similar high\nprobability rates of order $\\mathcal{O} (1/n)$ in nonconvex learning, rather\nthan in expectation. Furthermore, this type of learning rate is improved to\nfaster order $\\mathcal{O} (1/n^2)$ in uniform convergence regime.

In this paper, we\nbypass such attacks by introducing a structural watermarking scheme that\nutilizes channel pruning to embed the watermark into the host DNN architecture\ninstead of crafting the DNN parameters. To be specific, during watermark\nembedding, we prune the internal channels of the host DNN with the channel\npruning rates controlled by the watermark. During watermark extraction, the\nwatermark is retrieved by identifying the channel pruning rates from the\narchitecture of the target DNN model. Due to the superiority of pruning\nmechanism, the performance of the DNN model on its original task is reserved\nduring watermark embedding. Experimental results have shown that, the proposed\nwork enables the embedded watermark to be reliably recovered and provides a\nhigh watermark capacity, without sacrificing the usability of the DNN model.

However, novel machine-learning-based attacks\nhave recently been introduced to challenge the security foundations of locking\nschemes. These attacks are able to recover a significant percentage of the key\nwithout having access to an activated circuit. This paper address this issue\nthrough two focal points.

However, the internal mechanisms\nof many existing predictive algorithms are opaque and a human decision-maker is\nunable to understand \\emph{why} a certain activity was predicted. Recently,\ncounterfactuals have been proposed in the literature to derive\nhuman-understandable explanations from predictive models. Current\ncounterfactual approaches consist of finding the minimum feature change that\ncan make a certain prediction flip its outcome. Although many algorithms have\nbeen proposed, their application to the sequence and multi-dimensional data\nlike event logs has not been explored in the literature.\nIn this paper, we explore the use of a recent, popular model-agnostic\ncounterfactual algorithm, DiCE, in the context of predictive process analytics.\nThe analysis reveals that the algorithm is limited when being applied to derive\nexplanations of process predictions, due to (1) process domain knowledge not\nbeing taken into account, (2) long traces that often tend to be less\nunderstandable, and (3) difficulties in optimising the counterfactual search\nwith categorical variables. We design an extension of DiCE that can generate\ncounterfactuals for process predictions, and propose an approach that supports\nderiving milestone-aware counterfactuals at different stages of a trace to\npromote interpretability.

    "abstract": "Large-scale antenna arrays employed by the base station (BS) constitute an\nessential next-generation communications technique. However, due to the\nconstraints of size, cost, and power consumption, it is usually considered\nunrealistic to use a large-scale antenna array at the user side. Inspired by\nthe emerging technique of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), we firstly\npropose the concept of user-side RIS (US-RIS) for facilitating the employment\nof a large-scale antenna array at the user side in a cost- and energy-efficient\nway. In contrast to the existing employments of RIS, which belong to the family\nof base-station-side RISs (BSS-RISs), the US-RIS concept by definition\nfacilitates the employment of RIS at the user side for the first time. This is\nachieved by conceiving a multi-layer structure to realize a compact\nform-factor. Furthermore, our theoretical results demonstrate that, in contrast\nto the existing single-layer structure, where only the phase of the signal\nreflected from RIS can be adjusted, the amplitude of the signal penetrating\nmulti-layer US-RIS can also be partially controlled, which brings about a new\ndegree of freedom (DoF) for beamformer design that can be beneficially\nexploited for performance enhancement. In addition, based on the proposed\nmulti-layer US-RIS, we formulate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) maximization\nproblem of US-RIS-aided communications. Due to the non-convexity of the problem\nintroduced by this multi-layer structure, we propose a multi-layer transmit\nbeamformer design relying on an iterative algorithm for finding the optimal\nsolution by alternately updating each variable. Finally, our simulation results\nverify the superiority of the proposed multi-layer US-RIS as a compact\nrealization of a large-scale antenna array at the user side for uplink\ntransmission.",

In this paper, we study\ncardinality estimation for SQL queries with a focus on uncertainty, which we\nbelieve is important in database systems when dealing with a large number of\nuser queries on various applications. With uncertainty ensured, instead of\ntrusting an estimator learned as it is, a query optimizer can explore other\noptions when the estimator learned has a large variance, and it also becomes\npossible to update the estimator to improve its prediction in areas with high\nuncertainty. The approach we explore is different from the direction of\ndeploying sophisticated DL models in database systems to build cardinality\nestimators. We employ Bayesian deep learning (BDL), which serves as a bridge\nbetween Bayesian inference and deep learning.The prediction distribution by BDL\nprovides principled uncertainty calibration for the prediction. In addition,\nwhen the network width of a BDL model goes to infinity, the model performs\nequivalent to Gaussian Process (GP). This special class of BDL, known as Neural\nNetwork Gaussian Process (NNGP), inherits the advantages of Bayesian approach\nwhile keeping universal approximation of neural network, and can utilize a much\nlarger model space to model distribution-free data as a nonparametric model.

That's because accelerating\nGNNs is challenging due to their excessive memory usage and arbitrary\ninterleaving of diverse operations. Besides, the semantics gap between the\nhigh-level GNN programming model and efficient hardware makes it difficult in\naccelerating general-domain GNNs.\nTo address the challenge, we propose Zipper, an efficient yet general\nacceleration system for GNNs. The keys to Zipper include a graph-native\nintermediate representation (IR) and the associated compiler. By capturing GNN\nprimitive operations and representing with GNN IR, Zipper is able to fit GNN\nsemantics into hardware structure for efficient execution.

As present,\ndata-driven causal effect estimation faces two main challenges, i.e., selection\nbias and the missing of counterfactual. To address these two issues, most of\nthe existing approaches tend to reduce the selection bias by learning a\nbalanced representation, and then to estimate the counterfactual through the\nrepresentation.

    "title": "Joint Implicit Image Function for Guided Depth Super-Resolution",
    "abstract": "Guided depth super-resolution is a practical task where a low-resolution and\nnoisy input depth map is restored to a high-resolution version, with the help\nof a high-resolution RGB guide image. Existing methods usually view this task\nas a generalized guided filtering problem that relies on designing explicit\nfilters and objective functions, or a dense regression problem that directly\npredicts the target image via deep neural networks. These methods suffer from\neither model capability or interpretability. Inspired by the recent progress in\nimplicit neural representation, we propose to formulate the guided\nsuper-resolution as a neural implicit image interpolation problem, where we\ntake the form of a general image interpolation but use a novel Joint Implicit\nImage Function (JIIF) representation to learn both the interpolation weights\nand values. JIIF represents the target image domain with spatially distributed\nlocal latent codes extracted from the input image and the guide image, and uses\na graph attention mechanism to learn the interpolation weights at the same time\nin one unified deep implicit function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nJIIF representation on guided depth super-resolution task, significantly\noutperforming state-of-the-art methods on three public benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Undermining the impact of hateful content with informed and non-aggressive\nresponses, called counter narratives, has emerged as a possible solution for\nhaving healthier online communities. Thus, some NLP studies have started\naddressing the task of counter narrative generation. Although such studies have\nmade an effort to build hate speech / counter narrative (HS/CN) datasets for\nneural generation, they fall short in reaching either high-quality and/or\nhigh-quantity. In this paper, we propose a novel human-in-the-loop data\ncollection methodology in which a generative language model is refined\niteratively by using its own data from the previous loops to generate new\ntraining samples that experts review and/or post-edit. Our experiments\ncomprised several loops including dynamic variations. Results show that the\nmethodology is scalable and facilitates diverse, novel, and cost-effective data\ncollection. To our knowledge, the resulting dataset is the only expert-based\nmulti-target HS/CN dataset available to the community.",

    "abstract": "We consider a known variant of bin packing called {\\it cardinality\nconstrained bin packing}, also called {\\it bin packing with cardinality\nconstraints} (BPCC). In this problem, there is a parameter k\\geq 2, and items\nof rational sizes in [0,1] are to be packed into bins, such that no bin has\nmore than k items or total size larger than 1. The goal is to minimize the\nnumber of bins.\nA recently introduced concept, called the price of clustering, deals with\ninputs that are presented in a way that they are split into clusters. Thus, an\nitem has two attributes which are its size and its cluster. The goal is to\nmeasure the relation between an optimal solution that cannot combine items of\ndifferent clusters into bins, and an optimal solution that can combine items of\ndifferent clusters arbitrarily. Usually the number of clusters may be large,\nwhile clusters are relatively small, though not trivially small. Such problems\nare related to greedy bin packing algorithms, and to batched bin packing, which\nis similar to the price of clustering, but there is a constant number of large\nclusters. We analyze the price of clustering for BPCC, including the parametric\ncase with bounded item sizes. We discuss several greedy algorithms for this\nproblem that were not studied in the past, and comment on batched bin packing.",

    "abstract": "Epistemic Planning (EP) refers to an automated planning setting where the\nagent reasons in the space of knowledge states and tries to find a plan to\nreach a desirable state from the current state. Its general form, the\nMulti-agent Epistemic Planning (MEP) problem involves multiple agents who need\nto reason about both the state of the world and the information flow between\nagents. In a MEP problem, multiple approaches have been developed recently with\nvarying restrictions, such as considering only the concept of knowledge while\nnot allowing the idea of belief, or not allowing for ``complex\" modal operators\nsuch as those needed to handle dynamic common knowledge. While the diversity of\napproaches has led to a deeper understanding of the problem space, the lack of\na standardized way to specify MEP problems independently of solution approaches\nhas created difficulties in comparing performance of planners, identifying\npromising techniques, exploring new strategies like ensemble methods, and\nmaking it easy for new researchers to contribute to this research area. To\naddress the situation, we propose a unified way of specifying EP problems - the\nEpistemic Planning Domain Definition Language, E-PDDL. We show that E-PPDL can\nbe supported by leading MEP planners and provide corresponding parser code that\ntranslates EP problems specified in E-PDDL into (M)EP problems that can be\nhandled by several planners. This work is also useful in building more general\nepistemic planning environments where we envision a meta-cognitive module that\ntakes a planning problem in E-PDDL, identifies and assesses some of its\nfeatures, and autonomously decides which planner is the best one to solve it.",

    "abstract": "Flow and multicomponent reactive transport in saturated/unsaturated porous\nmedia are modeled by ensembles of computational particles moving on regular\nlattices according to specific random walk rules. The occupation number of the\nlattice sites is updated with a global random walk (GRW) procedure which\nsimulates the evolution of the ensemble with computational costs comparable to\nthose for a single random walk simulation in sequential procedures. To cope\nwith the nonlinearity and the degeneracy of the Richards equation the GRW flow\nsolver uses linearization techniques similar to the $L$-scheme developed in\nfinite element/volume approaches. Numerical schemes for reactive transport,\ncoupled with the flow solver via numerical solutions for saturation and water\nflux, are implemented in splitting procedures. Diffusion-advection steps are\nsolved by GRW algorithms using either biased or unbiased random walk\nprobabilities. Since the number of particles in GRW simulations can be as large\nas the number of molecules involved in chemical reactions, one avoids the\ncumbersome problem of rescaling particle densities to approximate\nconcentrations. Reaction steps are therefore formulated in terms of\nconcentrations, as in deterministic approaches. The numerical convergence of\nthe new schemes is demonstrated by comparisons with manufactured analytical\nsolutions. Coupled flow and reactive transport problems of contaminant\nbiodegradation described by the Monod model are further solved and the\ninfluence of flow nonlinearity/degeneracy and of the spatial heterogeneity of\nthe medium is investigated numerically.",

    "abstract": "We propose a model for finite games with deposit schemes and study how they\ncan be instantiated to incentivize an intended behavior. Doing so is trivial if\nthe deposit scheme can observe all actions taken in the game, as this allows it\nto simply keep the deposit for a party who does not play the intended strategy.\nInstead, we consider an abstraction where the deposit scheme is only allowed to\nprobabilistically infer information about what happened during the execution of\nthe game. We consider deposit schemes that are allowed to punish parties by\nwithholding parts of their deposit, and compensate the other players with what\nis left over. We show that deposit schemes can be used to implement any set of\nutilities if and only if it is able to essentially infer all information about\nwhat happened in the game. We give a definition of game-theoretic security that\ngeneralizes subgame perfection for finite games of perfect information by\nquantifying how much utility a dishonest party loses by deviating from the\nequilibrium. We show how finding an optimal deposit scheme that ensures\ngame-theoretic security, or showing no such scheme exists, can be stated as a\nlinear program and solved using standard methods. The deposit schemes outputted\nare optimal in the sense that the size of the largest deposit is minimal. We\nstate some additional desirable properties of deposit scheme and discuss\nvarious tradeoffs when deploying such systems in practice. We prove a lower\nbound on the size of the deposits, showing that the largest deposit must be\nlinear in the security parameter.",

    "title": "Precise Aerial Image Matching based on Deep Homography Estimation",
    "abstract": "Aerial image registration or matching is a geometric process of aligning two\naerial images captured in different environments. Estimating the precise\ntransformation parameters is hindered by various environments such as time,\nweather, and viewpoints. The characteristics of the aerial images are mainly\ncomposed of a straight line owing to building and road. Therefore, the straight\nlines are distorted when estimating homography parameters directly between two\nimages. In this paper, we propose a deep homography alignment network to\nprecisely match two aerial images by progressively estimating the various\ntransformation parameters. The proposed network is possible to train the\nmatching network with a higher degree of freedom by progressively analyzing the\ntransformation parameters. The precision matching performances have been\nincreased by applying homography transformation. In addition, we introduce a\nmethod that can effectively learn the difficult-to-learn homography estimation\nnetwork. Since there is no published learning data for aerial image\nregistration, in this paper, a pair of images to which random homography\ntransformation is applied within a certain range is used for learning. Hence,\nwe could confirm that the deep homography alignment network shows high\nprecision matching performance compared with conventional works.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has played a major role in the interpretation of dermoscopic\nimages for detecting skin defects and abnormalities. However, current deep\nlearning solutions for dermatological lesion analysis are typically limited in\nproviding probabilistic predictions which highlights the importance of\nconcerning uncertainties. This concept of uncertainty can provide a confidence\nlevel for each feature which prevents overconfident predictions with poor\ngeneralization on unseen data. In this paper, we propose an overall framework\nthat jointly considers dermatological classification and uncertainty estimation\ntogether. The estimated confidence of each feature to avoid uncertain feature\nand undesirable shift, which are caused by environmental difference of input\nimage, in the latent space is pooled from confidence network. Our qualitative\nresults show that modeling uncertainties not only helps to quantify model\nconfidence for each prediction but also helps classification layers to focus on\nconfident features, therefore, improving the accuracy for dermatological lesion\nclassification. We demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach in two\nstate-of-the-art dermoscopic datasets (ISIC 2018 and ISIC 2019).",

To address this, unsupervised machine translation (UMT) exploits\nlarge amounts of monolingual data by using synthetic data generation techniques\nsuch as back-translation and noising, while self-supervised NMT (SSNMT)\nidentifies parallel sentences in smaller comparable data and trains on them. To\ndate, the inclusion of UMT data generation techniques in SSNMT has not been\ninvestigated.

    "abstract": "Many robots move through the world by composing locomotion primitives like\nsteps and turns. To do so well, robots need not have primitives that make\nintuitive sense to humans. This becomes of paramount importance when robots are\ndamaged and no longer move as designed. Here we propose a goal function we call\n\"coverage\", that represents the usefulness of a library of locomotion\nprimitives in a manner agnostic to the particulars of the primitives\nthemselves. We demonstrate the ability to optimize coverage on both simulated\nand physical robots, and show that coverage can be rapidly recovered after\ninjury. This suggests that by optimizing for coverage, robots can sustain their\nability to navigate through the world even in the face of significant\nmechanical failures. The benefits of this approach are enhanced by\nsample-efficient, data-driven approaches to system identification that can\nrapidly inform the optimization of primitives. We found that the number of\ndegrees of freedom improved the rate of recovery of our simulated robots, a\nrare result in the fields of gait optimization and reinforcement learning. We\nshowed that a robot with limbs made of tree branches (for which no CAD model or\nfirst principles model was available) is able to quickly find an effective\nhigh-coverage library of motion primitives. The optimized primitives are\nentirely non-obvious to a human observer, and thus are unlikely to be\nattainable through manual tuning.",

In this\npaper, we revisit PDMM for optimisation over a centralized network. We first\nnote that the recently proposed method FedSplit [1] implements PDMM for a\ncentralized network. In [1], Inexact FedSplit (i.e., gradient based FedSplit)\nwas also studied both empirically and theoretically. We identify the cause for\nthe poor reported performance of Inexact FedSplit, which is due to the improper\ninitialisation in the gradient operations at the client side. To fix the issue\nof Inexact FedSplit, we propose two versions of Inexact PDMM, which are\nreferred to as gradient-based PDMM (GPDMM) and accelerated GPDMM (AGPDMM),\nrespectively. AGPDMM accelerates GPDMM at the cost of transmitting two times\nthe number of parameters from the server to each client per iteration compared\nto GPDMM. We provide a new convergence bound for GPDMM for a class of convex\noptimisation problems. Our new bounds are tighter than those derived for\nInexact FedSplit. We also investigate the update expressions of AGPDMM and\nSCAFFOLD to find their similarities. It is found that when the number K of\ngradient steps at the client side per iteration is K=1, both AGPDMM and\nSCAFFOLD reduce to vanilla gradient descent with proper parameter setup.\nExperimental results indicate that AGPDMM converges faster than SCAFFOLD when\nK>1 while GPDMM converges slightly worse than SCAFFOLD.",

In our framework, we\nfirst boost the convergence of the RL-pruner by transfer learning. Then, an\naugmented transfer learning scheme is proposed to further speed up the training\nprocess by improving the transferability. Finally, an assistant learning\nprocess is proposed to improve the sample efficiency of the RL agent. The\nexperiments have shown that our framework can accelerate the auto-pruning\nprocess by 1.5-2.5 times for ResNet20, and 1.81-2.375 times for other neural\nnetworks like ResNet56, ResNet18, and MobileNet v1.",

Semiconductor manufacturers want to make semiconductors with high\nyields.

    "abstract": "Reward function specification, which requires considerable human effort and\niteration, remains a major impediment for learning behaviors through deep\nreinforcement learning. In contrast, providing visual demonstrations of desired\nbehaviors often presents an easier and more natural way to teach agents. We\nconsider a setting where an agent is provided a fixed dataset of visual\ndemonstrations illustrating how to perform a task, and must learn to solve the\ntask using the provided demonstrations and unsupervised environment\ninteractions. This setting presents a number of challenges including\nrepresentation learning for visual observations, sample complexity due to high\ndimensional spaces, and learning instability due to the lack of a fixed reward\nor learning signal. Towards addressing these challenges, we develop a\nvariational model-based adversarial imitation learning (V-MAIL) algorithm. The\nmodel-based approach provides a strong signal for representation learning,\nenables sample efficiency, and improves the stability of adversarial training\nby enabling on-policy learning. Through experiments involving several\nvision-based locomotion and manipulation tasks, we find that V-MAIL learns\nsuccessful visuomotor policies in a sample-efficient manner, has better\nstability compared to prior work, and also achieves higher asymptotic\nperformance. We further find that by transferring the learned models, V-MAIL\ncan learn new tasks from visual demonstrations without any additional\nenvironment interactions.

Our model allows for a mixture of $q$ types of particles on a\n$d$-dimensional Euclidean region $\\mathbb{V}$ of volume $\\nu(\\mathbb{V})$. For\neach type, particle positions are distributed according to a Poisson point\nprocess. The Gibbs distribution over possible system states is given by the\nmixture of these point processes conditioned that no two particles are closer\nthan some distance parameterized by a $q \\times q$ matrix. This model\nencompasses classical continuous spin systems, such as the hard-sphere model or\nthe Widom-Rowlinson model. We present sufficient conditions for approximating\nthe partition function of this model, which is the normalizing factor of its\nGibbs measure. For the hard-sphere model, our method yields a randomized\napproximation algorithm with running time polynomial in $\\nu(\\mathbb{V})$ for\nthe known uniqueness regime of the Gibbs measure. In the same parameter regime,\nwe obtain a quasi-polynomial deterministic approximation, which, to our\nknowledge, is the first rigorous deterministic algorithm for a continuous spin\nsystem. We obtain similar approximation results for all continuous spin systems\ncaptured by our model and, in particular, the first explicit approximation\nbounds for the Widom-Rowlinson model. Additionally, we show how to obtain\nefficient approximate samplers for the Gibbs distributions of the respective\nspin systems within the same parameter regimes. Key to our method is reducing\nthe continuous model to a discrete instance of the hard-core model with size\npolynomial in $\\nu(\\mathbb{V})$. This generalizes existing discretization\nschemes for the hard-sphere model and, additionally, improves the required\nnumber of vertices of the generated graph from super-exponential to quadratic\nin $\\nu(\\mathbb{V})$, which we argue to be tight.",

The key element of Prompt is\na particle-based object representation, in which each particle represents a\npoint in the object, the local geometric, physical, and other features of the\npoint, and also its relation with other particles. Like the model-based\nanalytic approaches to manipulation, the particle representation enables the\nrobot to reason about the object's geometry and dynamics in order to choose\nsuitable manipulation actions. Like the data-driven approaches, the particle\nrepresentation is learned online in real-time from visual sensor input,\nspecifically, multi-view RGB images. The particle representation thus connects\nvisual perception with robot control. Prompt combines the benefits of both\nmodel-based reasoning and data-driven learning. We show empirically that Prompt\nsuccessfully handles a variety of everyday objects, some of which are\ntransparent. It handles various manipulation tasks, including grasping,\npushing, etc,.

    "title": "Energy Efficient Data Recovery from Corrupted LoRa Frames",
    "abstract": "High frame-corruption is widely observed in Long Range Wide Area Networks\n(LoRaWAN) due to the coexistence with other networks in ISM bands and an\nAloha-like MAC layer. LoRa's Forward Error Correction (FEC) mechanism is often\ninsufficient to retrieve corrupted data. In fact, real-life measurements show\nthat at least one-fourth of received transmissions are corrupted. When more\nframes are dropped, LoRa nodes usually switch over to higher spreading factors\n(SF), thus increasing transmission times and increasing the required energy.\nThis paper introduces ReDCoS, a novel coding technique at the application layer\nthat improves recovery of corrupted LoRa frames, thus reducing the overall\ntransmission time and energy invested by LoRa nodes by several-fold. ReDCoS\nutilizes lightweight coding techniques to pre-encode the transmitted data.\nTherefore, the inbuilt Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) that follows is computed\nbased on an already encoded data. At the receiver, we use both the CRC and the\ncoded data to recover data from a corrupted frame beyond the built-in Error\nCorrecting Code (ECC). We compare the performance of ReDCoS to (I) the standard\nFEC of vanilla-LoRaWAN, and to (ii) RS coding applied as ECC to the data of\nLoRaWAN. The results indicated a 54x and 13.5x improvement of decoding ratio,\nrespectively, when 20 data symbols were sent. Furthermore, we evaluated ReDCoS\non-field using LoRa SX1261 transceivers showing that it outperformed RS-coding\nby factor of at least 2x (and up to 6x) in terms of the decoding ratio while\nconsuming 38.5% less energy per correctly received transmission.",

However, federated learning suffers from high communication costs, as\na considerable number of model parameters need to be transmitted many times\nduring the training process, making the approach inefficient, especially when\nthe communication network bandwidth is limited. This article proposes RingFed,\na novel framework to reduce communication overhead during the training process\nof federated learning. Rather than transmitting parameters between the center\nserver and each client, as in original federated learning, in the proposed\nRingFed, the updated parameters are transmitted between each client in turn,\nand only the final result is transmitted to the central server, thereby\nreducing the communication overhead substantially. After several local updates,\nclients first send their parameters to another proximal client, not to the\ncenter server directly, to preaggregate. Experiments on two different public\ndatasets show that RingFed has fast convergence, high model accuracy, and low\ncommunication cost.",

    "abstract": "The rapid development of artificial intelligence together with the powerful\ncomputation capabilities of the advanced edge servers make it possible to\ndeploy learning tasks at the wireless network edge, which is dubbed as edge\nintelligence (EI). The communication bottleneck between the data resource and\nthe server results in deteriorated learning performance as well as tremendous\nenergy consumption. To tackle this challenge, we explore a new paradigm called\nlearning-and-energy-efficient (LEE) EI, which simultaneously maximizes the\nlearning accuracies and energy efficiencies of multiple tasks via data\npartition and rate control. Mathematically, this results in a multi-objective\noptimization problem. Moreover, the continuous varying rates over the whole\ntransmission duration introduce infinite variables. To solve this complex\nproblem, we consider the case with infinite server buffer capacity and one-shot\ndata arrival at sensor. First, the number of variables are reduced to a finite\nlevel by exploiting the optimality of constant-rate transmission in each epoch.\nSecond, the optimal solution is found by applying stratified sequencing or\nobjectives merging. By assuming higher priority of learning efficiency in\nstratified sequencing, the closed form of optimal data partition is derived by\nthe Lagrange method, while the optimal rate control is proved to have the\nstructure of directional water filling (DWF), based on which a string-pulling\n(SP) algorithm is proposed to obtain the numerical values. The DWF structure of\nrate control is also proved to be optimal in objectives merging via weighted\nsummation. By exploiting the optimal rate changing properties, the SP algorithm\nis further extended to account for the cases with limited server buffer\ncapacity or bursty data arrival at sensor. The performance of the proposed\ndesign is examined by extensive experiments based on public datasets.",

    "abstract": "Maintaining long-term exploration ability remains one of the challenges of\ndeep reinforcement learning (DRL). In practice, the reward shaping-based\napproaches are leveraged to provide intrinsic rewards for the agent to\nincentivize motivation. However, most existing IRS modules rely on attendant\nmodels or additional memory to record and analyze learning procedures, which\nleads to high computational complexity and low robustness. Moreover, they\noveremphasize the influence of a single state on exploration, which cannot\nevaluate the exploration performance from a global perspective. To tackle the\nproblem, state entropy-based methods are proposed to encourage the agent to\nvisit the state space more equitably. However, the estimation error and sample\ncomplexity are prohibitive when handling environments with high-dimensional\nobservation. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric entitled Jain's\nfairness index (JFI) to replace the entropy regularizer, which requires no\nadditional models or memory. In particular, JFI overcomes the vanishing\nintrinsic rewards problem and can be generalized into arbitrary tasks.\nFurthermore, we use a variational auto-encoder (VAE) model to capture the\nlife-long novelty of states. Finally, the global JFI score and local state\nnovelty are combined to form a multimodal intrinsic reward, controlling the\nexploration extent more precisely. Finally, extensive simulation results\ndemonstrate that our multimodal reward shaping (MMRS) method can achieve higher\nperformance in contrast to other benchmark schemes.",

We justify that the performance limitation is\ncaused by the gradient vanishing on these sample outliers.

To handle these issues, we propose a novel solution to\nexplicitly model and directly explore the uncertainty of the given unlabeled\nlearning samples. Instead of learning a deterministic feature point for each\nsample in the embedding space, we propose to represent a sample by a stochastic\nGaussian with the mean vector depicting its space localization and covariance\nvector representing the sample uncertainty. We leverage such uncertainty\nmodeling as momentum to the learning which is helpful to tackle the outliers.\nFurthermore, abundant positive candidates can be readily drawn from the learned\ninstance-specific distributions which are further adopted to mitigate the\naforementioned issues.

We present two\nalgorithms that enhance robust cable untangling, LOKI and SPiDERMan, which\noperate alongside HULK, a high-level planner from prior work. LOKI uses a\nlearned model of manipulation features to refine a coarse grasp keypoint\nprediction to a precise, optimized location and orientation, while SPiDERMan\nuses a learned model to sense task progress and apply recovery actions.

The golden ratio was first introduced by the famous mathematician\nFibonacci. The ratio of two consecutive numbers in the Fibonacci sequence is\nsimilar, and it is called the golden ratio, which is prevalent in nature, art,\narchitecture, and design. CDDO uses golden ratio and mimics cognitive learning\nand child's drawing development stages starting from the scribbling stage to\nthe advanced pattern-based stage. Hand pressure width, length and golden ratio\nof the child's drawing are tuned to attain better results. This helps children\nwith evolving, improving their intelligence and collectively achieving shared\ngoals. CDDO shows superior performance in finding the global optimum solution\nfor the optimization problems tested by 19 benchmark functions. Its results are\nevaluated against more than one state of art algorithms such as PSO, DE, WOA,\nGSA, and FEP. The performance of the CDDO is assessed, and the test result\nshows that CDDO is relatively competitive through scoring 2.8 ranks. This\ndisplays that the CDDO is outstandingly robust in exploring a new solution.\nAlso, it reveals the competency of the algorithm to evade local minima as it\ncovers promising regions extensively within the design space and exploits the\nbest solution.",

Because of\ntheir presumed advantages in handling and analyzing vast amounts of data,\ncomputer systems of automated decision-making (ADM) are implemented and\nsubstitute humans in decision-making processes. In this study, we focus on a\nspecific application of ADM in contrast to human decision-making (HDM), namely\nthe allocation of Covid-19 vaccines to the public. In particular, we elaborate\non the role of trust and social group preference on the legitimacy of vaccine\nallocation. We conducted a survey with a 2x2 randomized factorial design among\nn=1602 German respondents, in which we utilized distinct decision-making agents\n(HDM vs. ADM) and prioritization of a specific social group (teachers vs.\nprisoners) as design factors. Our findings show that general trust in ADM\nsystems and preference for vaccination of a specific social group influence the\nlegitimacy of vaccine allocation. However, contrary to our expectations, trust\nin the agent making the decision did not moderate the link between social group\npreference and legitimacy. Moreover, the effect was also not moderated by the\ntype of decision-maker (human vs. algorithm). We conclude that trustworthy ADM\nsystems must not necessarily lead to the legitimacy of ADM systems.",

We compared two classification strategies (binary vs. multi-class\nclassification) and investigated two approaches to generate candidate relations\nin different experimental settings. In this study, we compared three\ntransformer-based (BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet) models for relation extraction. We\ndemonstrated that the RoBERTa-clinical RE model achieved the best performance\non the 2018 MADE1.0 dataset with an F1-score of 0.8958.

    "abstract": "Document retrieval has taken its role in almost all domains of knowledge\nunderstanding, including the legal domain. Precedent refers to a court decision\nthat is considered as authority for deciding subsequent cases involving\nidentical or similar facts or similar legal issues. In this work, we propose\ndifferent unsupervised approaches to solve the task of identifying relevant\nprecedents to a given query case. Our proposed approaches are using word\nembeddings like word2vec, doc2vec, and sent2vec, finding cosine similarity\nusing TF-IDF, retrieving relevant documents using BM25 scores, using the\npre-trained model and SBERT to find the most similar document, and using the\nproduct of BM25 and TF-IDF scores to find the most relevant document for a\ngiven query. We compared all the methods based on precision@10, recall@10, and\nMRR. Based on the comparative analysis, we found that the TF-IDF score\nmultiplied by the BM25 score gives the best result. In this paper, we have also\npresented the analysis that we did to improve the BM25 score.",

    "abstract": "A serious problem in image classification is that a trained model might\nperform well for input data that originates from the same distribution as the\ndata available for model training, but performs much worse for\nout-of-distribution (OOD) samples. In real-world safety-critical applications,\nin particular, it is important to be aware if a new data point is OOD. To date,\nOOD detection is typically addressed using either confidence scores,\nauto-encoder based reconstruction, or by contrastive learning. However, the\nglobal image context has not yet been explored to discriminate the non-local\nobjectness between in-distribution and OOD samples. This paper proposes a\nfirst-of-its-kind OOD detection architecture named OODformer that leverages the\ncontextualization capabilities of the transformer. Incorporating the\ntrans\\-former as the principal feature extractor allows us to exploit the\nobject concepts and their discriminate attributes along with their\nco-occurrence via visual attention. Using the contextualised embedding, we\ndemonstrate OOD detection using both class-conditioned latent space similarity\nand a network confidence score. Our approach shows improved generalizability\nacross various datasets. We have achieved a new state-of-the-art result on\nCIFAR-10/-100 and ImageNet30.",

In practice, occlusion usually occurs and\nseriously affects accuracy of gait recognition. However, there is no available\ndatabase to support in-depth research of this problem, and state-of-arts gait\nrecognition methods have not paid enough attention to it, thus this paper\nfocuses on gait recognition under occlusion. We collect a new gait recognition\ndatabase called OG RGB+D database, which breaks through the limitation of other\ngait databases and includes multimodal gait data of various occlusions\n(self-occlusion, active occlusion, and passive occlusion) by our multiple\nsynchronous Azure Kinect DK sensors data acquisition system (multi-Kinect SDAS)\nthat can be also applied in security situations. Because Azure Kinect DK can\nsimultaneously collect multimodal data to support different types of gait\nrecognition algorithms, especially enables us to effectively obtain\ncamera-centric multi-person 3D poses, and multi-view is better to deal with\nocclusion than single-view. In particular, the OG RGB+D database provides\naccurate silhouettes and the optimized human 3D joints data (OJ) by fusing data\ncollected by multi-Kinects which are more accurate in human pose representation\nunder occlusion. We also use the OJ data to train an advanced 3D multi-person\npose estimation model to improve its accuracy of pose estimation under\nocclusion for universality. Besides, as human pose is less sensitive to\nocclusion than human appearance, we propose a novel gait recognition method\nSkeletonGait based on human dual skeleton model using a framework of siamese\nspatio-temporal graph convolutional networks (siamese ST-GCN).

    "abstract": "We propose a novel dense mapping framework for sparse visual SLAM systems\nwhich leverages a compact scene representation. State-of-the-art sparse visual\nSLAM systems provide accurate and reliable estimates of the camera trajectory\nand locations of landmarks. While these sparse maps are useful for\nlocalization, they cannot be used for other tasks such as obstacle avoidance or\nscene understanding. In this paper we propose a dense mapping framework to\ncomplement sparse visual SLAM systems which takes as input the camera poses,\nkeyframes and sparse points produced by the SLAM system and predicts a dense\ndepth image for every keyframe. We build on CodeSLAM and use a variational\nautoencoder (VAE) which is conditioned on intensity, sparse depth and\nreprojection error images from sparse SLAM to predict an uncertainty-aware\ndense depth map. The use of a VAE then enables us to refine the dense depth\nimages through multi-view optimization which improves the consistency of\noverlapping frames. Our mapper runs in a separate thread in parallel to the\nSLAM system in a loosely coupled manner. This flexible design allows for\nintegration with arbitrary metric sparse SLAM systems without delaying the main\nSLAM process. Our dense mapper can be used not only for local mapping but also\nglobally consistent dense 3D reconstruction through TSDF fusion. We demonstrate\nour system running with ORB-SLAM3 and show accurate dense depth estimation\nwhich could enable applications such as robotics and augmented reality.",

However,\nexperimentation on online platforms has been criticized for having, among other\nissues, a lack of meaningful oversight and user consent. As platforms give\nusers greater agency, it becomes possible to conduct observational studies in\nwhich users self-select into the treatment of interest as an alternative to\nexperiments in which the platform controls whether the user receives treatment\nor not. In this paper, we conduct four large-scale within-study comparisons on\nTwitter aimed at assessing the effectiveness of observational studies derived\nfrom user self-selection on online platforms. In a within-study comparison,\ntreatment effects from an observational study are assessed based on how\neffectively they replicate results from a randomized experiment with the same\ntarget population. We test the naive difference in group means estimator, exact\nmatching, regression adjustment, and inverse probability of treatment weighting\nwhile controlling for plausible confounding variables. In all cases, all\nobservational estimates perform poorly at recovering the ground-truth estimate\nfrom the analogous randomized experiments. In all cases except one, the\nobservational estimates have the opposite sign of the randomized estimate. Our\nresults suggest that observational studies derived from user self-selection are\na poor alternative to randomized experimentation on online platforms.

For very large\nproblems, an iterative solver is needed and, in general, a preconditioner is\nrequired to achieve good convergence. In recent years, a number of\npreconditioners have been proposed. These are largely serial and reported\nresults demonstrate that none of the commonly used preconditioners for the\nnormal equations matrix is capable of solving all sparse least-squares\nproblems. Our interest is thus in designing new preconditioners for the normal\nequations that are efficient, robust, and can be implemented in parallel. Our\nproposed preconditioners can be constructed efficiently and algebraically\nwithout any knowledge of the problem and without any assumption on the\nleast-squares matrix except that it is sparse. We exploit the structure of the\nsymmetric positive definite normal equations matrix and use the concept of\nalgebraic local symmetric positive semi-definite splittings to introduce\ntwo-level Schwarz preconditioners for least-squares problems. The condition\nnumber of the preconditioned normal equations is shown to be theoretically\nbounded independently of the number of subdomains in the splitting.

In recent years, state-of-the-art\nmethods have adopted Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) to encode meaningful\nfeatures for image fusion.

Transformer-based models are designed to\novercome this by modeling the long-range dependencies with the help of\nself-attention mechanism. This motivates us to propose a novel Image Fusion\nTransformer (IFT) where we develop a transformer-based multi-scale fusion\nstrategy that attends to both local and long-range information (or global\ncontext). The proposed method follows a two-stage training approach. In the\nfirst stage, we train an auto-encoder to extract deep features at multiple\nscales. In the second stage, multi-scale features are fused using a\nSpatio-Transformer (ST) fusion strategy. The ST fusion blocks are comprised of\na CNN and a transformer branch which capture local and long-range features,\nrespectively.

Although the accuracy of the models with 14\nfeatures is slightly better than 8 features, the empirical time taken by 8\nfeatures is 1.4x lesser than 14 features for LGBM and 1.5x lesser for GBR.\nFurthermore, reducing the number of features any more significantly hampers the\nperformance of all the ML models. Therefore, we conclude that 8 is the optimal\nnumber of features that can be used to predict the final rank of a player in\nPUBG with high accuracy and low run-time.",

It relies on a new\ndeveloped technique for the evaluation of polynomial integrals over spline\nboundary representations that is exclusively based on analytical computations.\nFirst, through a consistent polynomial approximation step, the finite element\noperators of the Galerkin method are transformed into integrals involving only\npolynomial integrands. Then, by successive applications of the divergence\ntheorem, those integrals over B-Reps are transformed into first surface and\nthen line integrals with polynomials integrands. Eventually these line\nintegrals are evaluated analytically with machine precision accuracy. The\nperformance of the proposed method is demonstrated by means of numerical\nexperiments in the context of 2D and 3D elliptic problems, retrieving optimal\nerror convergence order in all cases. Finally, the methodology is illustrated\nfor 3D CAD models with an industrial level of complexity.",

Since practitioners face speed versus accuracy tradeoffs in these\nmodels, variational inference (VI) is often the preferable option.\nUnfortunately, VI makes strong assumptions on both the factorization and\nfunctional form of the posterior. In this work, we propose a new non-parametric\nvariational approximation that makes no assumptions about the approximate\nposterior's functional form and allows practitioners to specify the exact\ndependencies the algorithm should respect or break.

This way, statistical dependencies can be broken in a\ncontrolled way, allowing the chain to mix faster.

One study was a\nretrospective examination of current practices and difficulties, from which we\nidentified three scenarios involving presentations of data. We describe these\nscenarios using an analogy to musical performance: small collaborative team\nmeetings are akin to jam session, while more structured presentations can range\nfrom semi-improvisational performances among peers to formal recitals given to\nexecutives or customers. In our second study, we grounded the discussion around\nthree design probes, each examining a different aspect of presenting data: the\nprogressive reveal of visualization to direct attention and advance a\nnarrative, visualization presentation controls that are hidden from the\naudience's view, and the coordination of a presenter's video with interactive\nvisualization.

While methods for collecting\nhuman demonstrations are becoming easier with teleoperation methods and the use\nof low-cost assistive tools, we often still require 100-1000 demonstrations for\nevery task to learn a visual representation and policy. To address this, we\nturn to an alternate form of data that does not require task-specific\ndemonstrations -- play. Playing is a fundamental method children use to learn a\nset of skills and behaviors and visual representations in early learning.\nImportantly, play data is diverse, task-agnostic, and relatively cheap to\nobtain. In this work, we propose to use playful interactions in a\nself-supervised manner to learn visual representations for downstream tasks. We\ncollect 2 hours of playful data in 19 diverse environments and use\nself-predictive learning to extract visual representations. Given these\nrepresentations, we train policies using imitation learning for two downstream\ntasks: Pushing and Stacking. We demonstrate that our visual representations\ngeneralize better than standard behavior cloning and can achieve similar\nperformance with only half the number of required demonstrations.

    "abstract": "Complex design problems are common in the scientific and industrial fields.\nIn practice, objective functions or constraints of these problems often do not\nhave explicit formulas, and can be estimated only at a set of sampling points\nthrough experiments or simulations. Such optimization problems are especially\nchallenging when design parameters are high-dimensional due to the curse of\ndimensionality. In this work, we propose a data-informed deep optimization\n(DiDo) approach as follows: first, we use a deep neural network (DNN)\nclassifier to learn the feasible region; second, we sample feasible points\nbased on the DNN classifier for fitting of the objective function; finally, we\nfind optimal points of the DNN-surrogate optimization problem by gradient\ndescent. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our DiDo approach, we consider a\npractical design case in industry, in which our approach yields good solutions\nusing limited size of training data. We further use a 100-dimension toy example\nto show the effectiveness of our model for higher dimensional problems. Our\nresults indicate that the DiDo approach empowered by DNN is flexible and\npromising for solving general high-dimensional design problems in practice.",

They allow us to\nintegrate in a natural way expert knowledge, physical modeling, heterogeneous\nand correlated data and quantities of interest. For exactly this reason,\nmultiple sources of model uncertainty are inherent within the modular structure\nof the graphical model. In this paper we develop information-theoretic, robust\nuncertainty quantification methods and non-parametric stress tests for directed\ngraphical models to assess the effect and the propagation through the graph of\nmulti-sourced model uncertainties to quantities of interest. These methods\nallow us to rank the different sources of uncertainty and correct the graphical\nmodel by targeting its most impactful components with respect to the quantities\nof interest. Thus, from a machine learning perspective, we provide a\nmathematically rigorous approach to correctability that guarantees a systematic\nselection for improvement of components of a graphical model while controlling\npotential new errors created in the process in other parts of the model.

Two\ndistinctive features of our approach are that (i) projections or optimizations\nover the entire feasible set are avoided, in stark contrast to projected\ngradient methods or the Frank-Wolfe method, and (ii) iterates are allowed to\nbecome infeasible, which differs from active set or feasible direction methods,\nwhere the descent motion stops as soon as a new constraint is encountered. The\nresulting algorithmic procedure is simple to implement even when constraints\nare nonlinear, and is suitable for large-scale constrained optimization\nproblems in which the feasible set fails to have a simple structure. The key\nunderlying idea is that constraints are expressed in terms of velocities\ninstead of positions, which has the algorithmic consequence that optimizations\nover feasible sets at each iteration are replaced with optimizations over\nlocal, sparse convex approximations. The result is a simplified suite of\nalgorithms and an expanded range of possible applications in machine learning.",

In\nparticular, for biomedical applications such as Lab-on-Chip systems, micropumps\nare used to transport and manipulate test fluids in a controlled manner. In\nthis work, a low-cost, structurally simple, piezoelectrically actuated\nmicropump was simulated and fabricated using poly-dimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The\nchannels in PDMS were fabricated using patterned SU-8 structures. The pump flow\nrate was measured to be 9.49 uL/min, 14.06 uL/min, 20.87 uL/min for applied\nvoltages of 12 V, 14 V, 16 V respectively. Further, we report finite element\nanalysis (FEA) simulation to confirm the operation of the micropump and compare\nfavorably the experimentally obtained flowrate with the one predicted by\nsimulation. By taking these flow rates as a reference, the chamber pressure was\nfound to be 1.1 to 1.5 kPa from FEA simulations.\nViscosity measurement has wide-ranging applications from the oil industry to\nthe pharmaceutical industry. This work provides an elaborate mathematical model\nand study of measurement of viscosity in real-time using pressure sensors. For\na given flowrate, a change in liquid viscosity gives rise to a change in\npressure difference across a particular section of the pipe. Hence, by\nrecording the pressure change, viscosity can be calculated dynamically.\nMathematical modeling as well as finite element analysis (FEA) modeling has\nbeen presented. A set of pressure sensors were placed at a fixed distance from\neach other to get the real-time pressure change. Knowing the flow rate in the\nchannel, the viscosity has been calculated from the pressure difference. For\nthe finite element analysis, the pressure sensors were placed 60 mm away from\neach other. A different ratio of the mixture of water and glycerol was used to\nprovide variable viscosity, which led to the variation in pressure-difference\nvalues.",

We present a\ndeep learning-based approach to predict lung infiltrate progression from serial\nchest radiographs (CXRs) of COVID-19 patients. Our method first utilizes\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction from patches within\nthe concerned lung zone, and also from neighboring and remote boundary regions.\nThe framework further incorporates a multi-scale Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)\nwith a correlation module for effective predictions. The GRU accepts CNN\nfeature vectors from three different areas as input and generates a fused\nrepresentation. The correlation module attempts to minimize the correlation\nloss between hidden representations of concerned and neighboring area feature\nvectors, while maximizing the loss between the same from concerned and remote\nregions. Further, we employ an attention module over the output hidden states\nof each encoder timepoint to generate a context vector. This vector is used as\nan input to a decoder module to predict patch severity grades at a future\ntimepoint. Finally, we ensemble the patch classification scores to calculate\npatient-wise grades. Specifically, our framework predicts zone-wise disease\nseverity for a patient on a given day by learning representations from the\nprevious temporal CXRs.

    "abstract": "From the flashes of fireflies to Josephson junctions and power\ninfrastructure, networks of coupled phase oscillators provide a powerful\nframework to describe synchronization phenomena in many natural and engineered\nsystems. Most real-world networks are under the influence of noisy, random\ninputs, potentially inhibiting synchronization. While noise is unavoidable,\nhere we show that there exist optimal noise patterns which minimize\ndesynchronizing effects and even enhance order. Specifically, using analytical\narguments we show that in the case of a two-oscillator model, there exists a\nsharp transition from a regime where the optimal synchrony-enhancing noise is\nperfectly anti-correlated, to one where the optimal noise is correlated. More\ngenerally, we then use numerical optimization methods to demonstrate that there\nexist anti-correlated noise patterns that optimally enhance synchronization in\nlarge complex oscillator networks. Our results may have implications in\nreal-world networks such as power grids and neuronal networks, which are\nsubject to significant amounts of correlated input noise.",

    "abstract": "Domain shift is one of the most salient challenges in medical computer\nvision. Due to immense variability in scanners' parameters and imaging\nprotocols, even images obtained from the same person and the same scanner could\ndiffer significantly. We address variability in computed tomography (CT) images\ncaused by different convolution kernels used in the reconstruction process, the\ncritical domain shift factor in CT. The choice of a convolution kernel affects\npixels' granularity, image smoothness, and noise level. We analyze a dataset of\npaired CT images, where smooth and sharp images were reconstructed from the\nsame sinograms with different kernels, thus providing identical anatomy but\ndifferent style. Though identical predictions are desired, we show that the\nconsistency, measured as the average Dice between predictions on pairs, is just\n0.54. We propose Filtered Back-Projection Augmentation (FBPAug), a simple and\nsurprisingly efficient approach to augment CT images in sinogram space\nemulating reconstruction with different kernels. We apply the proposed method\nin a zero-shot domain adaptation setup and show that the consistency boosts\nfrom 0.54 to 0.92 outperforming other augmentation approaches. Neither specific\npreparation of source domain data nor target domain data is required, so our\npublicly released FBPAug can be used as a plug-and-play module for zero-shot\ndomain adaptation in any CT-based task.",

Corresponding \\textit{cospanning equivalence\nrelations} were investigated for greedoids in much detail (Korte, Lovasz,\nSchrader; 1991). For instance, these relations determine greedoids uniquely. In\nfact, the feasible sets of a greedoid are exactly the inclusion-wise minimal\nsets of the equivalence classes. In this research, we show that feasible sets\nof convex geometries are the inclusion-wise maximal sets of the equivalence\nclasses of the corresponding closure operator. Same as greedoids, convex\ngeometries are uniquely defined by the corresponding cospanning relations. For\neach closure operator $\\sigma$, an element $x\\in X$ is \\textit{an extreme\npoint} of $X$ if $x\\notin\\sigma(X-x)$. The set of extreme points of $X$ is\ndenoted by $ex(X)$. We prove, that if $\\sigma$ has the anti-exchange property,\nthen for every set $X$ its equivalence class $[X]_{\\sigma}$ is the interval\n$[ex(X),\\sigma(X)]$. It results in the one-to-one correspondence between the\ncospanning partitions of an antimatroid and its complementary convex geometry.\nThe obtained results are based on the connection between violator spaces,\ngreedoids, and antimatroids. Cospanning characterization of these combinatorial\nstructures allows us not only to give the new characterization of antimatroids\nand convex geometries but also to obtain the new properties of closure\noperators, extreme point operators, and their interconnections.",

    "abstract": "Existing approaches for anti-spoofing in automatic speaker verification (ASV)\nstill lack generalizability to unseen attacks. The Res2Net approach designs a\nresidual-like connection between feature groups within one block, which\nincreases the possible receptive fields and improves the system's detection\ngeneralizability. However, such a residual-like connection is performed by a\ndirect addition between feature groups without channel-wise priority. We argue\nthat the information across channels may not contribute to spoofing cues\nequally, and the less relevant channels are expected to be suppressed before\nadding onto the next feature group, so that the system can generalize better to\nunseen attacks. This argument motivates the current work that presents a novel,\nchannel-wise gated Res2Net (CG-Res2Net), which modifies Res2Net to enable a\nchannel-wise gating mechanism in the connection between feature groups. This\ngating mechanism dynamically selects channel-wise features based on the input,\nto suppress the less relevant channels and enhance the detection\ngeneralizability. Three gating mechanisms with different structures are\nproposed and integrated into Res2Net.

    "abstract": "We show that a competitive equilibrium always exists in combinatorial\nauctions with anonymous graphical valuations and pricing, using discrete\ngeometry. This is an intuitive and easy-to-construct class of valuations that\ncan model both complementarity and substitutes, and to our knowledge, it is the\nfirst class besides gross substitutes that have guaranteed competitive\nequilibrium. We prove through counter-examples that our result is tight, and we\ngive explicit algorithms for constructive competitive pricing vectors. We also\ngive extensions to multi-unit combinatorial auctions (also known as product-mix\nauctions). Combined with theorems on graphical valuations and pricing\nequilibrium of Candogan, Ozdagar and Parillo, our results indicate that\nquadratic pricing is a highly practical method to run combinatorial auctions.",

    "abstract": "Meningioma is one of the most prevalent brain tumors in adults. To determine\nits malignancy, it is graded by a pathologist into three grades according to\nWHO standards. This grade plays a decisive role in treatment, and yet may be\nsubject to inter-rater discordance. In this work, we present and compare three\napproaches towards fully automatic meningioma grading from histology whole\nslide images. All approaches are following a two-stage paradigm, where we first\nidentify a region of interest based on the detection of mitotic figures in the\nslide using a state-of-the-art object detection deep learning network. This\nregion of highest mitotic rate is considered characteristic for biological\ntumor behavior. In the second stage, we calculate a score corresponding to\ntumor malignancy based on information contained in this region using three\ndifferent settings. In a first approach, image patches are sampled from this\nregion and regression is based on morphological features encoded by a\nResNet-based network. We compare this to learning a logistic regression from\nthe determined mitotic count, an approach which is easily traceable and\nexplainable. Lastly, we combine both approaches in a single network. We trained\nthe pipeline on 951 slides from 341 patients and evaluated them on a separate\nset of 141 slides from 43 patients. All approaches yield a high correlation to\nthe WHO grade. The logistic regression and the combined approach had the best\nresults in our experiments, yielding correct predictions in 32 and 33 of all\ncases, respectively, with the image-based approach only predicting 25 cases\ncorrectly. Spearman's correlation was 0.716, 0.792 and 0.790 respectively. It\nmay seem counterintuitive at first that morphological features provided by\nimage patches do not improve model performance. Yet, this mirrors the criteria\nof the grading scheme, where mitotic count is the only unequivocal parameter.",

The synthetic CT image is valuable for\nradiotherapy planning when only an MR image is available. Recent approaches\nhave made large strides in solving this challenging synthesis problem with\nconvolutional neural networks that learn a mapping from MR inputs to CT\noutputs. In this paper, we find that all existing approaches share a common\nlimitation: reconstruction breaks down in and around the high-frequency parts\nof CT images. To address this common limitation, we introduce\nfrequency-supervised deep networks to explicitly enhance high-frequency\nMR-to-CT image reconstruction. We propose a frequency decomposition layer that\nlearns to decompose predicted CT outputs into low- and high-frequency\ncomponents, and we introduce a refinement module to improve high-frequency\nreconstruction through high-frequency adversarial learning. Experimental\nresults on a new dataset with 45 pairs of 3D MR-CT brain images show the\neffectiveness and potential of the proposed approach.

    "abstract": "Distribution networks (DNs) that contain large amounts of distributed energy\nresources (DER) may experience peer-to-peer power flows between customers.\nThese power flows can create technical challenges and their pricing poses\nsocio-economic questions regarding fairness and equity. This paper demonstrates\nhow these challenges can be addressed in unison by deploying Community-scale\nEnergy Storage (CES) and updating DN pricing structures with a tier of local\nnetwork tariffs. While both of these interventions have been studied in\nisolation, we for the first time show how their combination can be symbiotic\nand resolve the shortcomings that each faces when deployed in isolation - the\nfeasibility of CES is no longer blocked by network tariffs and local network\ntariffs are no longer a zero-sum trade off between DN operators and customer\nsegments. Our study simulates the operation of a CES under a range of local\nnetwork tariff models, using current Australian electricity prices and current\nnetwork prices as a reference. We assess the financial outcomes for solar and\nnon-solar owning customers and the DN operator, as well as the self-sufficiency\nof the local network and self-consumption of locally generated solar power. Our\nresults establish that it is critical for local network tariffs to be set to\nless than half the standard distribution network tariff in order for the CES to\nachieve its full potential and for all stakeholders to benefit.

    "abstract": "Local explanation methods such as LIME have become popular in MIR as tools\nfor generating post-hoc, model-agnostic explanations of a model's\nclassification decisions. The basic idea is to identify a small set of\nhuman-understandable features of the classified example that are most\ninfluential on the classifier's prediction. These are then presented as an\nexplanation. Evaluation of such explanations in publications often resorts to\naccepting what matches the expectation of a human without actually being able\nto verify if what the explanation shows is what really caused the model's\nprediction. This paper reports on targeted investigations where we try to get\nmore insight into the actual veracity of LIME's explanations in an audio\nclassification task. We deliberately design adversarial examples for the\nclassifier, in a way that gives us knowledge about which parts of the input are\npotentially responsible for the model's (wrong) prediction. Asking LIME to\nexplain the predictions for these adversaries permits us to study whether local\nexplanations do indeed detect these regions of interest. We also look at\nwhether LIME is more successful in finding perturbations that are more\nprominent and easily noticeable for a human. Our results suggest that LIME does\nnot necessarily manage to identify the most relevant input features and hence\nit remains unclear whether explanations are useful or even misleading.",
