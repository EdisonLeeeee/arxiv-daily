    "title": "UAV Control Optimization via Decentralized Markov Decision Processes",
    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm control has applications including target\ntracking, surveillance, terrain mapping, and precision agriculture.\nDecentralized control methods are particularly useful when the swarm is large,\nas centralized methods (a single command center controlling the UAVs) suffer\nfrom exponential computational complexity, i.e., the computing time to obtain\nthe optimal control for the UAVs grow exponentially with the number of UAVs in\nthe swarm in centralized approaches. Although many centralized control methods\nexist, literature lacks decentralized control frameworks with broad\napplicability. To address this knowledge gap, we present a novel decentralized\nUAV swarm control strategy using a decision-theoretic framework called\ndecentralized Markov decision process (Dec-MDP). We build these control\nstrategies in the context of two case studies: a) swarm formation control\nproblem; b) swarm control for multitarget tracking. As most decision theoretic\nformulations suffer from the curse of dimensionality, we adapt an approximate\ndynamic programming method called nominal belief-state optimization (NBO) to\nsolve the decentralized control problems approximately in both the case\nstudies. In the formation control case study, the objective is to drive the\nswarm from a geographical region to another geographical region where the swarm\nmust form a certain geometrical shape (e.g., selected location on the surface\nof a sphere). The motivation for studying such problems comes from data fusion\napplications with UAV swarms where the fusion performance depends on the\nstrategic relative separation of the UAVs from each other. In the target\ntracking case study, the objective is the control the motion of the UAVs in a\ndecentralized manner while maximizing the overall target tracking performance.\nMotivation for this case study comes from the surveillance applications using\nUAV swarms.",

    "abstract": "In machine learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been extremely\ninfluential in both computer vision and in recognizing patterns extended over\ntime. In computer vision, part of the flexibility arises from the use of\nmax-pooling operations over the convolutions to attain translation invariance.\nIn the mammalian brain, neural representations of time use a set of temporal\nbasis functions. Critically, these basis functions appear to be arranged in a\ngeometric series such that the basis set is evenly distributed over logarithmic\ntime. This paper introduces a Scale-Invariant Temporal History Convolution\nnetwork (SITHCon) that uses a logarithmically-distributed temporal memory. A\nmax-pool over a logarithmically-distributed temporal memory results in\nscale-invariance in time. We compare performance of SITHCon to a Temporal\nConvolution Network (TCN) and demonstrate that, although both networks can\nlearn classification and regression problems on both univariate and\nmultivariate time series $f(t)$, only SITHCon has the property that it\ngeneralizes without retraining to rescaled versions of the input $f(at)$. This\nproperty, inspired by findings from neuroscience and psychology, could lead to\nlarge-scale networks with dramatically different capabilities, including faster\ntraining and greater generalizability, even with significantly fewer free\nparameters.",

For solving this problem, it is the\ncommon practice to use so-called optimal triangulation method, which we call\nthe L2 method in this paper. But, the method can be optimal only if we assume\nno uncertainty in the camera parameters. Through extensive comparison on\nsynthetic and real data, we observed that the L2 method is actually not the\nbest choice when there is uncertainty in the camera parameters. Interestingly,\nit can be observed that the simple mid-point method outperforms other methods.\nApart from its high performance, the mid-point method has a simple closed\nformed solution for multiple camera images while the L2 method is hard to be\nused for more than two camera images. Therefore, in contrast to the common\npractice, we argue that the simple mid-point method should be used in\nstructure-from-motion applications where there is uncertainty in camera\nparameters.",

Our approach, Diverse Video Generator, uses a Gaussian Process (GP) to\nlearn priors on future states given the past and maintains a probability\ndistribution over possible futures given a particular sample. In addition, we\nleverage the changes in this distribution over time to control the sampling of\ndiverse future states by estimating the end of ongoing sequences.

    "abstract": "Atmospheric correction is a fundamental task in remote sensing because\nobservations are taken either of the atmosphere or looking through the\natmosphere. Atmospheric correction errors can significantly alter the spectral\nsignature of the observations, and lead to invalid classifications or target\ndetection. This is even more crucial when working with hyperspectral data,\nwhere a precise measurement of spectral properties is required.\nState-of-the-art physics-based atmospheric correction approaches require\nextensive prior knowledge about sensor characteristics, collection geometry,\nand environmental characteristics of the scene being collected. These\napproaches are computationally expensive, prone to inaccuracy due to lack of\nsufficient environmental and collection information, and often impossible for\nreal-time applications. In this paper, a geometry-dependent hybrid neural\nnetwork is proposed for automatic atmospheric correction using multi-scan\nhyperspectral data collected from different geometries. The proposed network\ncan characterize the atmosphere without any additional meteorological data. A\ngrid-search method is also proposed to solve the temperature emissivity\nseparation problem. Results show that the proposed network has the capacity to\naccurately characterize the atmosphere and estimate target emissivity spectra\nwith a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) under 0.02 for 29 different materials.

In particular, such representations can be used to\naugment the state space of the underlying decision process, thereby\nfacilitating non-Markovian reinforcement learning.

As these efforts intensify, reasoning within the burgeoning field of\n\"algorithmic fairness\" increasingly shapes how fairness manifests in practice.\nThis paper interrogates whether algorithmic fairness provides the appropriate\nconceptual and practical tools for enhancing social equality. I argue that the\ndominant, \"formal\" approach to algorithmic fairness is ill-equipped as a\nframework for pursuing equality, as its narrow frame of analysis generates\nrestrictive approaches to reform. In light of these shortcomings, I propose an\nalternative: a \"substantive\" approach to algorithmic fairness that centers\nopposition to social hierarchies and provides a more expansive analysis of how\nto address inequality. This substantive approach enables more fruitful\ntheorizing about the role of algorithms in combatting oppression. The\ndistinction between formal and substantive algorithmic fairness is exemplified\nby each approach's responses to the \"impossibility of fairness\" (an\nincompatibility between mathematical definitions of algorithmic fairness).\nWhile the formal approach requires us to accept the \"impossibility of fairness\"\nas a harsh limit on efforts to enhance equality, the substantive approach\nallows us to escape the \"impossibility of fairness\" by suggesting reforms that\nare not subject to this false dilemma and that are better equipped to\nameliorate conditions of social oppression.",

Specifically, we demonstrate strong correlations between\nin-distribution and out-of-distribution performance on variants of CIFAR-10 &\nImageNet, a synthetic pose estimation task derived from YCB objects, satellite\nimagery classification in FMoW-WILDS, and wildlife classification in\niWildCam-WILDS. The strong correlations hold across model architectures,\nhyperparameters, training set size, and training duration, and are more precise\nthan what is expected from existing domain adaptation theory. To complete the\npicture, we also investigate cases where the correlation is weaker, for\ninstance some synthetic distribution shifts from CIFAR-10-C and the tissue\nclassification dataset Camelyon17-WILDS. Finally, we provide a candidate theory\nbased on a Gaussian data model that shows how changes in the data covariance\narising from distribution shift can affect the observed correlations.",

    "abstract": "Training and using modern neural-network based latent-variable generative\nmodels (like Variational Autoencoders) often require simultaneously training a\ngenerative direction along with an inferential(encoding) direction, which\napproximates the posterior distribution over the latent variables. Thus, the\nquestion arises: how complex does the inferential model need to be, in order to\nbe able to accurately model the posterior distribution of a given generative\nmodel?\nIn this paper, we identify an important property of the generative map\nimpacting the required size of the encoder. We show that if the generative map\nis \"strongly invertible\" (in a sense we suitably formalize), the inferential\nmodel need not be much more complex. Conversely, we prove that there exist\nnon-invertible generative maps, for which the encoding direction needs to be\nexponentially larger (under standard assumptions in computational complexity).\nImportantly, we do not require the generative model to be layerwise invertible,\nwhich a lot of the related literature assumes and isn't satisfied by many\narchitectures used in practice (e.g. convolution and pooling based networks).\nThus, we provide theoretical support for the empirical wisdom that learning\ndeep generative models is harder when data lies on a low-dimensional manifold.",

Moreover, we investigate the class of\ncommutative permutation DFAs. Their structural properties allow us to decide\ncompositionality in NLOGSPACE, and even in LOGSPACE if the alphabet size is\nfixed. Despite this low complexity, we show that complex behaviors still arise\nin this class: we provide a family of composite DFAs each requiring\npolynomially many factors with respect to its size. We also consider the\nvariant of the problem that asks whether a DFA is k-factor composite, that is,\ndecomposable into k smaller DFAs, for some given integer k. We show that, for\ncommutative permutation DFAs, restricting the number of factors makes the\ndecision computationally harder, and yields a problem with tight bounds: it is\nNP-complete.

    "title": "An Initial Investigation of Non-Native Spoken Question-Answering",
    "abstract": "Text-based machine comprehension (MC) systems have a wide-range of\napplications, and standard corpora exist for developing and evaluating\napproaches. There has been far less research on spoken question answering (SQA)\nsystems. The SQA task considered in this paper is to extract the answer from a\ncandidate$\\text{'}$s spoken response to a question in a prompt-response style\nlanguage assessment test. Applying these MC approaches to this SQA task rather\nthan, for example, off-topic response detection provides far more detailed\ninformation that can be used for further downstream processing. One significant\nchallenge is the lack of appropriately annotated speech corpora to train\nsystems for this task. Hence, a transfer-learning style approach is adopted\nwhere a system trained on text-based MC is evaluated on an SQA task with\nnon-native speakers. Mismatches must be considered between text documents and\nspoken responses; non-native spoken grammar and written grammar. In practical\nSQA, ASR systems are used, necessitating an investigation of the impact of ASR\nerrors. We show that a simple text-based ELECTRA MC model trained on SQuAD2.0\ntransfers well for SQA. It is found that there is an approximately linear\nrelationship between ASR errors and the SQA assessment scores but grammar\nmismatches have minimal impact.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an end-to-end lifelong learning mixture of experts.\nEach expert is implemented by a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). The experts in\nthe mixture system are jointly trained by maximizing a mixture of individual\ncomponent evidence lower bounds (MELBO) on the log-likelihood of the given\ntraining samples. The mixing coefficients in the mixture, control the\ncontributions of each expert in the goal representation. These are sampled from\na Dirichlet distribution whose parameters are determined through non-parametric\nestimation during lifelong learning. The model can learn new tasks fast when\nthese are similar to those previously learnt. The proposed Lifelong mixture of\nVAE (L-MVAE) expands its architecture with new components when learning a\ncompletely new task. After the training, our model can automatically determine\nthe relevant expert to be used when fed with new data samples. This mechanism\nbenefits both the memory efficiency and the required computational cost as only\none expert is used during the inference. The L-MVAE inference model is able to\nperform interpolation in the joint latent space across the data domains\nassociated with different tasks and is shown to be efficient for disentangled\nlearning representation.",

    "abstract": "What is the power of constant-depth circuits with $MOD_m$ gates, that can\ncount modulo $m$? Can they efficiently compute MAJORITY and other symmetric\nfunctions? When $m$ is a constant prime power, the answer is well understood:\nRazborov and Smolensky proved in the 1980s that MAJORITY and $MOD_m$ require\nsuper-polynomial-size $MOD_q$ circuits, where $q$ is any prime power not\ndividing $m$. However, relatively little is known about the power of $MOD_m$\ncircuits for non-prime-power $m$. For example, it is still open whether every\nproblem in $EXP$ can be computed by depth-$3$ circuits of polynomial size and\nonly $MOD_6$ gates.\nWe shed some light on the difficulty of proving lower bounds for $MOD_m$\ncircuits, by giving new upper bounds. We construct $MOD_m$ circuits computing\nsymmetric functions with non-prime power $m$, with size-depth tradeoffs that\nbeat the longstanding lower bounds for $AC^0[m]$ circuits for prime power $m$.\nOur size-depth tradeoff circuits have essentially optimal dependence on $m$ and\n$d$ in the exponent, under a natural circuit complexity hypothesis.\nFor example, we show for every $\\varepsilon > 0$ that every symmetric\nfunction can be computed with depth-3 $MOD_m$ circuits of\n$\\exp(O(n^{\\varepsilon}))$ size, for a constant $m$ depending only on\n$\\varepsilon > 0$. That is, depth-$3$ $CC^0$ circuits can compute any symmetric\nfunction in \\emph{subexponential} size. This demonstrates a significant\ndifference in the power of depth-$3$ $CC^0$ circuits, compared to other models:\nfor certain symmetric functions, depth-$3$ $AC^0$ circuits require\n$2^{\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})}$ size [H{\\aa}stad 1986], and depth-$3$ $AC^0[p^k]$\ncircuits (for fixed prime power $p^k$) require $2^{\\Omega(n^{1/6})}$ size\n[Smolensky 1987].

The pursuers aim to protect a goal region cooperatively from the\nevaders. Due to the high-dimensional strategy space among pursuers, we\ndecompose the whole game into multiple one-pursuer-one-evader subgames, each of\nwhich is solved in an analytical approach instead of solving\nHamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equations. For each subgame, an evasion region (ER) is\nintroduced, based on which a pursuit strategy guaranteeing the winning of a\nsimple-motion pursuer under specific conditions is proposed. Motivated by the\nsimple-motion pursuer, a strategy for a Dubins-car pursuer is proposed when the\npursuer-evader configuration satisfies separation condition (SC) and\ninterception orientation (IO). The necessary and sufficient condition on\ncapture radius, minimum turning radius and speed ratio to guarantee the pursuit\nwinning is derived. When the IO is not satisfied (Non-IO), a heading adjustment\npursuit strategy is proposed, and the condition to achieve IO within a finite\ntime, is given. Then, a two-step pursuit strategy is proposed for the SC and\nNon-IO case. A non-convex optimization problem is introduced to give a\ncondition guaranteeing the winning of the pursuer. A polynomial equation gives\na lower bound of the non-convex problem, providing a sufficient and efficient\npursuit winning condition.

In this paper, we consider numerical solutions of the modified\nAllen-Cahn equation with a Lagrange multiplier of nonlocal and local effects,\nwhich not only shares the same MBP as the original Allen-Cahn equation but also\nconserves the mass exactly. We reformulate the model equation with a linear\nstabilizing technique, then construct first- and second-order exponential time\ndifferencing schemes for its time integration. We prove the unconditional MBP\npreservation and mass conservation of the proposed schemes in the time discrete\nsense and derive their error estimates under some regularity assumptions.\nVarious numerical experiments in two and three dimensions are also conducted to\nverify the theoretical results.",

In this work,\nwe begin to fill this gap by examining one recent and successful pre-trained\nmodel (wav2vec 2.0), via its intermediate representation vectors, using a suite\nof analysis tools. We use the metrics of canonical correlation, mutual\ninformation, and performance on simple downstream tasks with non-parametric\nprobes, in order to (i) query for acoustic and linguistic information content,\n(ii) characterize the evolution of information across model layers, and (iii)\nunderstand how fine-tuning the model for automatic speech recognition (ASR)\naffects these observations.

    "abstract": "Android has become the most popular mobile operating system.

There exists one type of malware whose benign\nbehaviors are developed to camouflage malicious behaviors. The malicious\ncomponent occupies a small part of the entire code of the application (app for\nshort), and the malicious part is strongly coupled with the benign part. In\nthis case, the malware may cause false negatives when malware detectors extract\nfeatures from the entire apps to conduct classification because the malicious\nfeatures of these apps may be hidden among benign features. Moreover, some\nprevious work aims to divide the entire app into several parts to discover the\nmalicious part. However, the premise of these methods to commence app partition\nis that the connections between the normal part and the malicious part are\nweak.\nIn this paper, we call this type of malware as Android covert malware and\ngenerate the first dataset of covert malware. To detect them, we first conduct\nstatic analysis to extract the call graphs. Through the deep analysis on\ngraphs, we observe that although the correlations between the normal part and\nthe malicious part in these graphs are high, the degree of these correlations\nhas a distribution. Based on the observation, we design HomDroid to detect\ncovert malware by analyzing the homophily of call graphs. We identify the ideal\nthreshold of correlation to distinguish the normal part and the malicious part\nbased on the evaluation results on a dataset of 4,840 benign apps and 3,385\ncovert malicious apps.

    "abstract": "Presence of noise in the labels of large scale facial expression datasets has\nbeen a key challenge towards Facial Expression Recognition (FER) in the wild.\nDuring early learning stage, deep networks fit on clean data. Then, eventually,\nthey start overfitting on noisy labels due to their memorization ability, which\nlimits FER performance. This work proposes an effective training strategy in\nthe presence of noisy labels, called as Consensual Collaborative Training (CCT)\nframework. CCT co-trains three networks jointly using a convex combination of\nsupervision loss and consistency loss, without making any assumption about the\nnoise distribution. A dynamic transition mechanism is used to move from\nsupervision loss in early learning to consistency loss for consensus of\npredictions among networks in the later stage. Inference is done using a single\nnetwork based on a simple knowledge distillation scheme. Effectiveness of the\nproposed framework is demonstrated on synthetic as well as real noisy FER\ndatasets. In addition, a large test subset of around 5K images is annotated\nfrom the FEC dataset using crowd wisdom of 16 different annotators and reliable\nlabels are inferred. CCT is also validated on it.

To achieve decimeter-level accuracy, either fine-grained\nradio frequency (RF) information (e.g., channel state information) or\ncoarse-grained RF information (e.g., RSSI) from more than multiple antennas is\nrequired. Meanwhile, owing to deficiency of single-antenna RSSI which only\nindicates a distance between a receiver and a transmitter, realizing\nfine-grained localization accuracy with single coarse-grained RF information is\nchallenging. Our key idea to address this challenge is to leverage computer\nvision (CV) and to estimate the most likely Fresnel zone between the receiver\nand transmitter, where the role of RSSI is to detect blockage timings.\nSpecifically, historical positions of an obstacle that dynamically blocks the\nFresnel zone are detected by the CV technique, and we estimate positions at\nwhich a blockage starts and ends via a time series of RSSI. These estimated\nobstacle positions, in principle, coincide with points on the Fresnel zone\nboundaries, enabling the estimation of the Fresnel zone and localization of the\ntransmitter.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have shown impressive success in\nexploring high-dimensional environments to learn complex, long-horizon tasks,\nbut can often exhibit unsafe behaviors and require extensive environment\ninteraction when exploration is unconstrained. A promising strategy for safe\nlearning in dynamically uncertain environments is requiring that the agent can\nrobustly return to states where task success (and therefore safety) can be\nguaranteed. While this approach has been successful in low-dimensions,\nenforcing this constraint in environments with high-dimensional state spaces,\nsuch as images, is challenging. We present Latent Space Safe Sets (LS3), which\nextends this strategy to iterative, long-horizon tasks with image observations\nby using suboptimal demonstrations and a learned dynamics model to restrict\nexploration to the neighborhood of a learned Safe Set where task completion is\nlikely. We evaluate LS3 on 4 domains, including a challenging sequential\npushing task in simulation and a physical cable routing task. We find that LS3\ncan use prior task successes to restrict exploration and learn more efficiently\nthan prior algorithms while satisfying constraints.

    "abstract": "The weighted voltage mode control represents a method for control of multiple\noutputs DC-DC converters. Accordingly, the weighted control redistributes the\nerror among the outputs of these converters, and the regulation error can be\nreduced by adjusting the weighting factors. But the problem is that most\ndesigns are performed on the trial-and-error basis, and the results were rather\ninconsistent. Also, in conventional mathematical approaches, this factor is\ndesigned for converters by given parameters. In this paper, three optimization\nalgorithms namely Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA), Particle Swarm\nOptimization (PSO) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) are proposed for a quick\nand accurate estimation of the optimal weighting factors and improve the amount\nof regulation on outputs of multiple outputs forward DC-DC converters.\nFurthermore, Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) is utilized to minimize the total\nsteady-state error and improve transient characteristics by controlling the\nduty cycle of the PWM controller. Simulations have been performed in several\ncases and results show that the proposed method improves the outputs cross\nregulations in multiple outputs forward DC-DC converters significantly. ICA\nbased weighting factor estimator has higher speed and accuracy in comparison\nwith two other presented algorithms (ACO and PSO) and so is more effective in\ncomparison with them.",

    "abstract": "It is beneficial to automate the process of deriving concept hierarchies from\ncorpora since a manual construction of concept hierarchies is typically a\ntime-consuming and resource-intensive process. As such, the overall process of\nlearning concept hierarchies from corpora encompasses a set of steps: parsing\nthe text into sentences, splitting the sentences and then tokenising it. After\nthe lemmatisation step, the pairs are extracted using FCA. However, there might\nbe some uninteresting and erroneous pairs in the formal context. Generating\nformal context may lead to a time-consuming process, so formal context size\nreduction is required to remove uninterested and erroneous pairs, taking less\ntime to extract the concept lattice and concept hierarchies accordingly. In\nthis premise, this study aims to propose two frameworks: (1) A framework to\nreview the current process of deriving concept hierarchies from corpus\nutilising FCA; (2) A framework to decrease the formal contexts ambiguity of the\nfirst framework using an adaptive version of ECA*. Experiments are conducted by\napplying 385 sample corpora from Wikipedia on the two frameworks to examine the\nreducing size of formal context, which leads to yield concept lattice and\nconcept hierarchy. The resulting lattice of formal context is evaluated to the\nstandard one using concept lattice-invariants. Accordingly, the homomorphic\nbetween the two lattices preserves the quality of resulting concept hierarchies\nby 89% in contrast to the basic ones, and the reduced concept lattice inherits\nthe structural relation of the standard one. The adaptive ECA* is examined\nagainst its four counterpart baseline algorithms to measure the execution time\non random datasets with different densities (fill ratios). The results show\nthat adaptive ECA* performs concept lattice faster than other mentioned\ncompetitive techniques in different fill ratios.",

    "abstract": "Few-shot action recognition aims to recognize novel action classes (query)\nusing just a few samples (support). The majority of current approaches follow\nthe metric learning paradigm, which learns to compare the similarity between\nvideos. Recently, it has been observed that directly measuring this similarity\nis not ideal since different action instances may show distinctive temporal\ndistribution, resulting in severe misalignment issues across query and support\nvideos. In this paper, we arrest this problem from two distinct aspects --\naction duration misalignment and motion evolution misalignment. We address them\nsequentially through a Two-stage Temporal Alignment Network (TTAN). The first\nstage performs temporal transformation with the predicted affine warp\nparameters, while the second stage utilizes a cross-attention mechanism to\ncoordinate the features of the support and query to a consistent evolution.\nBesides, we devise a novel multi-shot fusion strategy, which takes the\nmisalignment among support samples into consideration.

In clinical settings,\nit is difficult to collect enough annotated target domain data in a short\nperiod. Few-shot domain adaptation, i.e., adapting a trained model with a\nhandful of annotations, is highly practical and useful in this case. In this\npaper, we propose a Polymorphic Transformer (Polyformer), which can be\nincorporated into any DNN backbones for few-shot domain adaptation.\nSpecifically, after the polyformer layer is inserted into a model trained on\nthe source domain, it extracts a set of prototype embeddings, which can be\nviewed as a \"basis\" of the source-domain features. On the target domain, the\npolyformer layer adapts by only updating a projection layer which controls the\ninteractions between image features and the prototype embeddings. All other\nmodel weights (except BatchNorm parameters) are frozen during adaptation. Thus,\nthe chance of overfitting the annotations is greatly reduced, and the model can\nperform robustly on the target domain after being trained on a few annotated\nimages. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Polyformer on two medical\nsegmentation tasks (i.e., optic disc/cup segmentation, and polyp segmentation).\nThe source code of Polyformer is released at\nhttps://github.com/askerlee/segtran.",

Networks with multi-stage architecture have\nbeen widely applied in many computer vision tasks with rich patterns, where a\npredictor stage first outputs initial predictions and an additional refinement\nstage operates on the initial predictions to perform further refinement.\nExisting works show that surgical video contents are well ordered and contain\nrich temporal patterns, making the multi-stage architecture well suited for the\nsurgical phase recognition task.

We test this\nidea by selectively retraining different portions of VGG and ResNet\narchitectures on CIFAR-10, Imagenette and ImageNet using non-adversarial and\nadversarial data. Our experimental results show that susceptibility to\nadversarial samples is associated with low-level feature extraction layers.\nTherefore, retraining high-level layers is insufficient for achieving\nrobustness. This phenomenon could have two explanations: either, adversarial\nattacks yield outputs from early layers that are indistinguishable from\nfeatures found in the attack classes, or adversarial attacks yield outputs from\nearly layers that differ statistically from features for non-adversarial\nsamples and do not permit consistent classification by subsequent layers. We\ntest this question by large-scale non-linear dimensionality reduction and\ndensity modeling on distributions of feature vectors in hidden layers and find\nthat the feature distributions between non-adversarial and adversarial samples\ndiffer substantially. Our results provide new insights into the statistical\norigins of adversarial samples and possible defenses.",

However, most existing approaches merely adopt the\nfirst-order connections among users during transfer learning, ignoring those\nconnections in higher orders.

In particular, migrating code to these languages is\nchallenging. Gradual typing can make dependently-typed languages easier to use\nby mixing static and dynamic checking in a principled way. With gradual types,\nprogrammers can incrementally migrate code to a dependently typed language.\nHowever, adding gradual types to dependent types creates a new challenge:\nmixing decidable type-checking and incremental migration in a full-featured\nlanguage is a precarious balance. Programmers expect type-checking to\nterminate, but dependent type-checkers evaluate terms at compile time, which is\nproblematic because gradual types can introduce non-termination into an\notherwise terminating language. Steps taken to mitigate this non-termination\nmust not jeopardize the smooth transitions between dynamic and static.\nWe present a gradual dependently-typed language that supports inductive type\nfamilies, has decidable type-checking, and provably supports smooth migration\nbetween static and dynamic, as codified by the refined criteria for gradual\ntyping proposed by Siek et al.

    "abstract": "Deep learning models have become a popular choice for medical image analysis.\nHowever, the poor generalization performance of deep learning models limits\nthem from being deployed in the real world as robustness is critical for\nmedical applications. For instance, the state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs) fail to detect adversarial samples or samples drawn\nstatistically far away from the training distribution. In this work, we\nexperimentally evaluate the robustness of a Mahalanobis distance-based\nconfidence score, a simple yet effective method for detecting abnormal input\nsamples, in classifying malaria parasitized cells and uninfected cells. Results\nindicated that the Mahalanobis confidence score detector exhibits improved\nperformance and robustness of deep learning models, and achieves\nstateof-the-art performance on both out-of-distribution (OOD) and adversarial\nsamples.",

The robots enter the graph one after\nanother from a particular vertex called the \\emph{Door} and disperse along the\nedges of the graph without collision to occupy vertices such that the set of\nvertices occupied by the robots is a maximal independent set. We assume the\nrobots have knowledge only about the maximum degree of the graph, denoted by\n$\\Delta$.\nIn this paper, we explore two versions of the problem: the solution to the\nfirst version, named as \\emph{MIS Filling with Single Door}, works under an\nasynchronous scheduler using robots with 3 hops of visibility range, $\\Delta +\n6$ number of colors and $O(\\log \\Delta)$ bits of persistent storage. The time\ncomplexity is measured in terms of epochs and it can be solved in $O(n^2)$\nepochs. An epoch is the smallest time interval in which each participating\nrobot gets activated and executes the algorithm at least once. For the second\nversion with $k~ ( > 1)$ \\textit{Doors}, named as \\emph{MIS Filling with\nMultiple Doors}, the solution works under a semi-synchronous scheduler using\nrobots with 5 hops of visibility range, $\\Delta + k + 6$ number of colors and\n$O(\\log (\\Delta + k))$ bits of persistent storage.

    "abstract": "A large labeled dataset is a key to the success of supervised deep learning,\nbut for medical image segmentation, it is highly challenging to obtain\nsufficient annotated images for model training. In many scenarios, unannotated\nimages are abundant and easy to acquire. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has\nshown great potentials in exploiting raw data information and representation\nlearning. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Self-Supervised Learning\n(HSSL), a new self-supervised framework that boosts medical image segmentation\nby making good use of unannotated data. Unlike the current literature on\ntask-specific self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised fine-tuning,\nwe utilize SSL to learn task-agnostic knowledge from heterogeneous data for\nvarious medical image segmentation tasks. Specifically, we first aggregate a\ndataset from several medical challenges, then pre-train the network in a\nself-supervised manner, and finally fine-tune on labeled data. We develop a new\nloss function by combining contrastive loss and classification loss and\npretrain an encoder-decoder architecture for segmentation tasks. Our extensive\nexperiments show that multi-domain joint pre-training benefits downstream\nsegmentation tasks and outperforms single-domain pre-training significantly.\nCompared to learning from scratch, our new method yields better performance on\nvarious tasks (e.g., +0.69% to +18.60% in Dice scores with 5% of annotated\ndata). With limited amounts of training data, our method can substantially\nbridge the performance gap w.r.t. denser annotations (e.g., 10% vs.~100% of\nannotated data).",

To avoid transaction\ngridlock, public blockchains impose large fees and per-block resource limits,\nmaking it difficult to accommodate the ever-growing transaction demand.\nPrevious research endeavors to improve the scalability of blockchain through\nvarious technologies, such as side-chaining, sharding, secured off-chain\ncomputation, communication network optimizations, and efficient consensus\nprotocols. However, these approaches have not attained a widespread adoption\ndue to their inability in delivering a cloud-like performance, in terms of the\nscalability in transaction throughput, storage, and compute capacity. In this\nwork, we determine that the major obstacle to public blockchain scalability is\ntheir underlying unstructured P2P networks. We further show that a centralized\nnetwork can support the deployment of decentralized smart contracts. We propose\na novel approach for achieving scalable decentralization: instead of trying to\nmake blockchain scalable, we deliver decentralization to already scalable cloud\nby using an Ethereum smart contract. We introduce Blockumulus, a framework that\ncan deploy decentralized cloud smart contract environments using a novel\ntechnique called overlay consensus. Through experiments, we demonstrate that\nBlockumulus is scalable in all three dimensions: computation, data storage, and\ntransaction throughput. Besides eliminating the current code execution and\nstorage restrictions, Blockumulus delivers a transaction latency between 2 and\n5 seconds under normal load.

    "abstract": "Range aggregate queries (RAQs) are an integral part of many real-world\napplications, where, often, fast and approximate answers for the queries are\ndesired. Recent work has studied answering RAQs using machine learning models,\nwhere a model of the data is learned to answer the queries. However, such\nmodelling choices fail to utilize any query specific information. To capture\nsuch information, we observe that RAQs can be represented by query functions,\nwhich are functions that take a query instance (i.e., a specific RAQ) as an\ninput and output its corresponding answer. Using this representation, we\nformulate the problem of learning to approximate the query function, and\npropose NeuroDB, a query specialized neural network framework, that answers\nRAQs efficiently. NeuroDB is query-type agnostic (i.e., it does not make any\nassumption about the underlying query type) and our observation that queries\ncan be represented by functions is not specific to RAQs. Thus, we investigate\nwhether NeuroDB can be used for other query types, by applying it to distance\nto nearest neighbour queries. We experimentally show that NeuroDB outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art for this query type, often by orders of magnitude.\nMoreover, the same neural network architecture as for RAQs is used, bringing to\nlight the possibility of using a generic framework to answer any query type\nefficiently.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the traffic monitoring problem in a road network using a\nteam of aerial robots. The problem is challenging due to two main reasons.\nFirst, the traffic events are stochastic, both temporally and spatially.\nSecond, the problem has a non-homogeneous structure as the traffic events\narrive at different locations of the road network at different rates.\nAccordingly, some locations require more visits by the robots compared to other\nlocations. To address these issues, we define an uncertainty metric for each\nlocation of the road network and formulate a path planning problem for the\naerial robots to minimize the network's average uncertainty. We express this\nproblem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and propose a\ndistributed and scalable algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning to\nsolve it. We consider two different scenarios depending on the communication\nmode between the agents (aerial robots) and the traffic management center\n(TMC). The first scenario assumes that the agents continuously communicate with\nthe TMC to send/receive real-time information about the traffic events. Hence,\nthe agents have global and real-time knowledge of the environment. However, in\nthe second scenario, we consider a challenging setting where the observation of\nthe aerial robots is partial and limited to their sensing ranges. Moreover, in\ncontrast to the first scenario, the information exchange between the aerial\nrobots and the TMC is restricted to specific time instances. We evaluate the\nperformance of our proposed algorithm in both scenarios for a real road network\ntopology and demonstrate its functionality in a traffic monitoring system.",

Such behaviors can be\ncaptured by the equilibria of differential games which provide an expressive\nframework for modeling the agents' mutual influence. However, finding the\nequilibria of differential games is in general challenging as it involves\nsolving a set of coupled optimal control problems. In this work, we propose to\nleverage the special structure of multi-agent interactions to generate\ninteractive trajectories by simply solving a single optimal control problem,\nnamely, the optimal control problem associated with minimizing the potential\nfunction of the differential game. Our key insight is that for a certain class\nof multi-agent interactions, the underlying differential game is indeed a\npotential differential game for which equilibria can be found by solving a\nsingle optimal control problem. We introduce such an optimal control problem\nand build on single-agent trajectory optimization methods to develop a\ncomputationally tractable and scalable algorithm for planning multi-agent\ninteractive trajectories.

    "abstract": "Domain adaptation (DA) approaches address domain shift and enable networks to\nbe applied to different scenarios. Although various image DA approaches have\nbeen proposed in recent years, there is limited research towards video DA. This\nis partly due to the complexity in adapting the different modalities of\nfeatures in videos, which includes the correlation features extracted as\nlong-term dependencies of pixels across spatiotemporal dimensions. The\ncorrelation features are highly associated with action classes and proven their\neffectiveness in accurate video feature extraction through the supervised\naction recognition task. Yet correlation features of the same action would\ndiffer across domains due to domain shift. Therefore we propose a novel\nAdversarial Correlation Adaptation Network (ACAN) to align action videos by\naligning pixel correlations. ACAN aims to minimize the distribution of\ncorrelation information, termed as Pixel Correlation Discrepancy (PCD).\nAdditionally, video DA research is also limited by the lack of cross-domain\nvideo datasets with larger domain shifts. We, therefore, introduce a novel\nHMDB-ARID dataset with a larger domain shift caused by a larger statistical\ndifference between domains.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the evolution of opinions over social networks with\nbounded confidence in social cliques. Node initial opinions are independently\nand identically distributed; at each time step, nodes review the average\nopinions of a randomly selected local clique. The clique averages may represent\nlocal group pressures on peers. Then nodes update their opinions under bounded\nconfidence: only when the difference between an agent individual opinion and\nthe corresponding local clique pressure is below a threshold, this agent\nopinion is updated according to the DeGroot rule as a weighted average of the\ntwo values. As a result, this opinion dynamics is a generalization of the\nclassical Deffuant-Weisbuch model in which only pairwise interactions take\nplace. First of all, we prove conditions under which all node opinions converge\nto finite limits. We show that in the limits the event that all nodes achieve a\nconsensus, and the event that all nodes achieve pairwise distinct limits, i.e.,\nsocial disagreements, are both nontrivial events. Next, we show that opinion\nfluctuations may take place in the sense that at least one agent in the network\nfails to hold a converging opinion trajectory. In fact, we prove that this\nfluctuation event happens with a strictly positive probability, and also\nconstructively present an initial value event under which the fluctuation event\narises with probability one. These results add to the understanding of the role\nof bounded confidence in social opinion dynamics, and the possibility of\nfluctuation reveals that bringing in cliques in Deffuant-Weisbuch models have\nfundamentally changed the behavior of such opinion dynamical processes.",

    "abstract": "A common problem with most zero and few-shot learning approaches is they\nsuffer from bias towards seen classes resulting in sub-optimal performance.\nExisting efforts aim to utilize unlabeled images from unseen classes (i.e\ntransductive zero-shot) during training to enable generalization. However, this\nlimits their use in practical scenarios where data from target unseen classes\nis unavailable or infeasible to collect. In this work, we present a practical\nsetting of inductive zero and few-shot learning, where unlabeled images from\nother out-of-data classes, that do not belong to seen or unseen categories, can\nbe used to improve generalization in any-shot learning. We leverage a\nformulation based on product-of-experts and introduce a new AUD module that\nenables us to use unlabeled samples from out-of-data classes which are usually\neasily available and practically entail no annotation cost. In addition, we\nalso demonstrate the applicability of our model to address a more practical and\nchallenging, Generalized Zero-shot under a limited supervision setting, where\neven base seen classes do not have sufficient annotated samples.",

    "title": "Designing Recommender Systems to Depolarize",
    "abstract": "Polarization is implicated in the erosion of democracy and the progression to\nviolence, which makes the polarization properties of large algorithmic content\nselection systems (recommender systems) a matter of concern for peace and\nsecurity. While algorithm-driven social media does not seem to be a primary\ndriver of polarization at the country level, it could be a useful intervention\npoint in polarized societies. This paper examines algorithmic depolarization\ninterventions with the goal of conflict transformation: not suppressing or\neliminating conflict but moving towards more constructive conflict. Algorithmic\nintervention is considered at three stages: which content is available\n(moderation), how content is selected and personalized (ranking), and content\npresentation and controls (user interface). Empirical studies of online\nconflict suggest that the exposure diversity intervention proposed as an\nantidote to \"filter bubbles\" can be improved and can even worsen polarization\nunder some conditions. Using civility metrics in conjunction with diversity in\ncontent selection may be more effective. However, diversity-based interventions\nhave not been tested at scale and may not work in the diverse and dynamic\ncontexts of real platforms. Instead, intervening in platform polarization\ndynamics will likely require continuous monitoring of polarization metrics,\nsuch as the widely used \"feeling thermometer.\" These metrics can be used to\nevaluate product features, and potentially engineered as algorithmic\nobjectives. It may further prove necessary to include polarization measures in\nthe objective functions of recommender algorithms to prevent optimization\nprocesses from creating conflict as a side effect.",

    "abstract": "Most of the current supervised automatic music transcription (AMT) models\nlack the ability to generalize. This means that they have trouble transcribing\nreal-world music recordings from diverse musical genres that are not presented\nin the labelled training data. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised\nframework, ReconVAT, which solves this issue by leveraging the huge amount of\navailable unlabelled music recordings. The proposed ReconVAT uses\nreconstruction loss and virtual adversarial training. When combined with\nexisting U-net models for AMT, ReconVAT achieves competitive results on common\nbenchmark datasets such as MAPS and MusicNet. For example, in the few-shot\nsetting for the string part version of MusicNet, ReconVAT achieves F1-scores of\n61.0% and 41.6% for the note-wise and note-with-offset-wise metrics\nrespectively, which translates into an improvement of 22.2% and 62.5% compared\nto the supervised baseline model.

Associated with the development of finite\nelement methods has been the concurrent development of an engineering science\ndiscipline called computational mechanics, or computational science and\nengineering.\nIn this paper, we present a historical perspective on the developments of\nfinite element methods mainly focusing on its applications and related\ndevelopments in solid and structural mechanics, with limited discussions to\nother fields in which it has made significant impact, such as fluid mechanics,\nheat transfer, and fluid-structure interaction. To have a complete storyline,\nwe divide the development of the finite element method into four time periods:\nI. (1941-1965) Early years of FEM; II. (1966-1991) Golden age of FEM; III.\n(1992-2017) Large scale, industrial applications of FEM and development of\nmaterial modeling, and IV (2018-) the state-of-the-art FEM technology for the\ncurrent and future eras of FEM research.

They fail to explain the\nmodel in terms of the domain they are designed for. The proposed Iterative\nVisual Logical Classifier (IVLC) is an interpretable machine learning algorithm\nthat allows end users to design a model and classify data with more confidence\nand without having to compromise on the accuracy. Such technique is especially\nhelpful when dealing with sensitive and crucial data like cancer data in the\nmedical domain with high cost of errors. With the help of the proposed\ninteractive and lossless multidimensional visualization, end users can identify\nthe pattern in the data based on which they can make explainable decisions.\nSuch options would not be possible in black box machine learning methodologies.\nThe interpretable IVLC algorithm is supported by the Interactive Shifted Paired\nCoordinates Software System (SPCVis). It is a lossless multidimensional data\nvisualization system with user interactive features. The interactive approach\nprovides flexibility to the end user to perform data classification as\nself-service without having to rely on a machine learning expert. Interactive\npattern discovery becomes challenging while dealing with large data sets with\nhundreds of dimensions/features. To overcome this problem, this chapter\nproposes an automated classification approach combined with new Coordinate\nOrder Optimizer (COO) algorithm and a Genetic algorithm. The COO algorithm\nautomatically generates the coordinate pair sequences that best represent the\ndata separation and the genetic algorithm helps optimizing the proposed IVLC\nalgorithm by automatically generating the areas for data classification.

    "abstract": "5G communication system can support the demanding quality-of-service (QoS)\nrequirements of many advanced vehicle-to-everything (V2X) use cases. However,\nthe safe and efficient driving, especially of automated vehicles, may be\naffected by sudden changes of the provided QoS. For that reason, the prediction\nof the QoS changes and the early notification of these predicted changes to the\nvehicles have been recently enabled by 5G communication systems.

This article describes how QoS prediction could be\ngenerated by a 5G communication system and delivered to a V2X application. The\ntele-operated driving use case is used as an example to analyze the feasibility\nof a QoS prediction scheme.

To address this\nissue, we propose a Cross-Lingual Transposition ReThinking (XLTT) model by\nmodelling existing high-quality extractive reading comprehension datasets in a\nmultilingual environment. To be specific, we present multilingual adaptive\nattention (MAA) to combine intra-attention and inter-attention to learn more\ngeneral generalizable semantic and lexical knowledge from each pair of language\nfamilies. Furthermore, to make full use of existing datasets, we adopt a new\ntraining framework to train our model by calculating task-level similarities\nbetween each existing dataset and target dataset.

In the literature, high localization accuracy is achieved with the\nmainstream strongly supervised frameworks. However, such methods require\nobject-level annotations and are unable to detect objects of unknown\ncategories. Weakly supervised methods face similar difficulties. In this paper,\na self-paced learning framework is proposed to achieve accurate object\nlocalization on the rank list returned by instance search. The proposed\nframework mines the target instance gradually from the queries and their\ncorresponding top-ranked search results. Since a common instance is shared\nbetween the query and the images in the rank list, the target visual instance\ncan be accurately localized even without knowing what the object category is.\nIn addition to performing localization on instance search, the issue of\nfew-shot object detection is also addressed under the same framework.

Improving predictive power\nwas the focus of previous representation techniques, which unfortunately\nperform rather poorly on the interpretability in terms of extracting underlying\ninsights of the data. Recently, Kolmogorov model (KM) was studied, which is an\ninterpretable and predictable representation approach to learning the\nunderlying probabilistic structure of a set of random variables. The existing\nKM learning algorithms using semi-definite relaxation with randomization\n(SDRwR) or discrete monotonic optimization (DMO) have, however, limited utility\nto big data applications because they do not scale well computationally. In\nthis paper, we propose a computationally scalable KM learning algorithm, based\non the regularized dual optimization combined with enhanced gradient descent\n(GD) method. To make our method more scalable to large-dimensional problems, we\npropose two acceleration schemes, namely, eigenvalue decomposition (EVD)\nelimination strategy and proximal EVD algorithm. Furthermore, a thresholding\ntechnique by exploiting the approximation error analysis and leveraging the\nnormalized Minkowski $\\ell_1$-norm and its bounds, is provided for the\nselection of the number of iterations of the proximal EVD algorithm. When\napplied to big data applications, it is demonstrated that the proposed method\ncan achieve compatible training/prediction performance with significantly\nreduced computational complexity; roughly two orders of magnitude improvement\nin terms of the time overhead, compared to the existing KM learning algorithms.\nFurthermore, it is shown that the accuracy of logical relation mining for\ninterpretability by using the proposed KM learning algorithm exceeds $80\\%$.",

In this paper,\nwe consider the maximum likelihood (ML) detection problem of binary symbols\ntransmitted over a multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) channel, where\nfinding the optimal solution is exponentially hard using classical computers.\nHere, we apply the QAOA for the ML detection by encoding the problem of\ninterest into a level-p QAOA circuit having 2p variational parameters, which\ncan be optimized by classical optimizers.

    "abstract": "Length Rate Quotient (LRQ) is the first algorithm of interleaved shaping -- a\nnovel concept proposed to provide per-flow shaping for a flow aggregate without\nper-flow queuing. This concept has been adopted by Time-Sensitive Networking\n(TSN) and Deterministic Networking (DetNet). An appealing property of\ninterleaved shaping is that, when an interleaved shaper is appended to a FIFO\nsystem, it does not increase the worst-case delay of the system. Based on this\n\"shaping-for-free\" property, an approach has been introduced to deliver bounded\nend-to-end latency. Specifically, at each output link of a node, class-based\naggregate scheduling is used together with one interleaved shaper per-input\nlink and per-class, and the interleaved shaper re-shapes every flow to its\ninitial traffic constraint. In this paper, we investigate other properties of\ninterleaved LRQ shapers, particularly as stand-alone elements. In addition,\nunder per-flow setting, we also investigate per-flow LRQ based flow aggregation\nand derive its properties. The analysis focuses directly on the timing of\noperations, such as shaping and scheduling, in the network. This timing based\nmethod can be found in the Guaranteed Rate (GR) server model and more generally\nthe max-plus branch of network calculus. With the derived properties, we not\nonly show that an improved end-to-end latency bound can be obtained for the\ncurrent approach, but also demonstrate with two examples that new approaches\nmay be devised. End-to-end delay bounds for the three approaches are derived\nand compared. As a highlight, the two new approaches do not require different\nnode architectures in allocating (shaping / scheduling) queues, which implies\nthat they can be readily adapted for use in TSN and DetNet. This together with\nthe derived properties of LRQ shed new insights on providing the TSN / DetNet\nqualities of service.",

To reduce the labeling error effects, one common practice is\nto distribute each instance to multiple workers, whereas each worker only\nannotates a subset of data, resulting in the {\\it sparse annotation}\nphenomenon. In this paper, we note that when meeting with class-imbalance,\ni.e., when the ground truth labels are {\\it class-imbalanced}, the sparse\nannotations are prone to be skewly distributed, which thus can severely bias\nthe learning algorithm. To combat this issue, we propose one self-training\nbased approach named {\\it Self-Crowd} by progressively adding confident\npseudo-annotations and rebalancing the annotation distribution. Specifically,\nwe propose one distribution aware confidence measure to select confident\npseudo-annotations, which adopts the resampling strategy to oversample the\nminority annotations and undersample the majority annotations. On one\nreal-world crowdsourcing image classification task, we show that the proposed\nmethod yields more balanced annotations throughout training than the\ndistribution agnostic methods and substantially improves the learning\nperformance at different annotation sparsity levels.",

Most of the recent approaches for PU classification\nassume that the class-prior (the ratio of positive samples) in the training\nunlabeled dataset is identical to that of the test data, which does not hold in\nmany practical cases. In addition, we usually do not know the class-priors of\nthe training and test data, thus we have no clue on how to train a classifier\nwithout them.

    "abstract": "Being able to explain the prediction to clinical end-users is a necessity to\nleverage the power of AI models for clinical decision support. For medical\nimages, saliency maps are the most common form of explanation. The maps\nhighlight important features for AI model's prediction. Although many saliency\nmap methods have been proposed, it is unknown how well they perform on\nexplaining decisions on multi-modal medical images, where each modality/channel\ncarries distinct clinical meanings of the same underlying biomedical\nphenomenon. Understanding such modality-dependent features is essential for\nclinical users' interpretation of AI decisions. To tackle this clinically\nimportant but technically ignored problem, we propose the MSFI\n(Modality-Specific Feature Importance) metric to examine whether saliency maps\ncan highlight modality-specific important features. MSFI encodes the clinical\nrequirements on modality prioritization and modality-specific feature\nlocalization. Our evaluations on 16 commonly used saliency map methods,\nincluding a clinician user study, show that although most saliency map methods\ncaptured modality importance information in general, most of them failed to\nhighlight modality-specific important features consistently and precisely. The\nevaluation results guide the choices of saliency map methods and provide\ninsights to propose new ones targeting clinical applications.",

However, most\nexisting methods fail to take full use of the locality geometric structure and\nsimilarity relationship among samples under the multi-view scenario. To solve\nthese issues, we propose a novel multi-view learning method with locality\nrelationship constraint to explore the problem of multi-view clustering, called\nLocality Relationship Constrained Multi-view Clustering Framework (LRC-MCF).\nLRC-MCF aims to explore the diversity, geometric, consensus and complementary\ninformation among different views, by capturing the locality relationship\ninformation and the common similarity relationships among multiple views.\nMoreover, LRC-MCF takes sufficient consideration to weights of different views\nin finding the common-view locality structure and straightforwardly produce the\nfinal clusters. To effectually reduce the redundancy of the learned\nrepresentations, the low-rank constraint on the common similarity matrix is\nconsidered additionally. To solve the minimization problem of LRC-MCF, an\nAlternating Direction Minimization (ADM) method is provided to iteratively\ncalculate all variables LRC-MCF.

A popular\ntheory for explaining why SGD works well in practice is that the algorithm has\nan implicit regularization that biases its output towards a good solution.\nPerhaps the theoretically most well understood learning setting for SGD is that\nof Stochastic Convex Optimization (SCO), where it is well known that SGD learns\nat a rate of $O(1/\\sqrt{n})$, where $n$ is the number of samples. In this\npaper, we consider the problem of SCO and explore the role of implicit\nregularization, batch size and multiple epochs for SGD. Our main contributions\nare threefold:\n(a) We show that for any regularizer, there is an SCO problem for which\nRegularized Empirical Risk Minimzation fails to learn. This automatically rules\nout any implicit regularization based explanation for the success of SGD.\n(b) We provide a separation between SGD and learning via Gradient Descent on\nempirical loss (GD) in terms of sample complexity. We show that there is an SCO\nproblem such that GD with any step size and number of iterations can only learn\nat a suboptimal rate: at least $\\widetilde{\\Omega}(1/n^{5/12})$.\n(c) We present a multi-epoch variant of SGD commonly used in practice. We\nprove that this algorithm is at least as good as single pass SGD in the worst\ncase. However, for certain SCO problems, taking multiple passes over the\ndataset can significantly outperform single pass SGD.\nWe extend our results to the general learning setting by showing a problem\nwhich is learnable for any data distribution, and for this problem, SGD is\nstrictly better than RERM for any regularization function. We conclude by\ndiscussing the implications of our results for deep learning, and show a\nseparation between SGD and ERM for two layer diagonal neural networks.",

Nonlinear methods differ from\nlinear based techniques by their use of a nonlinear mapping instead of adding\nnew vectors to enlarge the projection basis. Invariant manifolds have been\nfirst introduced in vibration theory within the context of nonlinear normal\nmodes (NNMs) and have been initially computed from the modal basis, using\neither a graph representation or a normal form approach to compute mappings and\nreduced dynamics.

In this work, we propose a solution to tackle the\npanoptic segmentation task. The overall structure combines the bottom-up method\nand the top-down method. Therefore, not only can there be better performance,\nbut also the execution speed can be maintained. The network mainly pays\nattention to the quality of the mask. In the previous work, we can see that the\nuneven contour of the object is more likely to appear, resulting in low-quality\nprediction. Accordingly, we propose enhancement features and corresponding loss\nfunctions for the silhouette of objects and backgrounds to improve the mask.\nMeanwhile, we use the new proposed confidence score to solve the occlusion\nproblem and make the network tend to use higher quality masks as prediction\nresults. To verify our research, we used the COCO dataset and CityScapes\ndataset to do experiments and obtained competitive results with fast inference\ntime.",

One of its\nbranches, called Machine Learning (ML), has shown strong capacities in\nmimicking characteristics attributed to human intelligence, such as vision,\nspeech, and problem-solving. However, as previous technological revolutions\nsuggest, their most significant impacts could be mostly expected on other\nsectors that were not traditional users of that technology. The agricultural\nsector is vital for African economies; improving yields, mitigating losses, and\neffective management of natural resources are crucial in a climate change era.\nMachine Learning is a technology with an added value in making predictions,\nhence the potential to reduce uncertainties and risk across sectors, in this\ncase, the agricultural sector. The purpose of this paper is to contextualize\nand discuss barriers to ML-based solutions for African agriculture. In the\nsecond section, we provided an overview of ML technology from a historical and\ntechnical perspective and its main driving force. In the third section, we\nprovided a brief review of the current use of ML in agriculture.

The key\nis to exploit its extension problem by converting the flat singular kernels\ninto strongly localized ones, so that the major contribution of weakly singular\nintegrals over a semi-infinite interval can be captured by a few Laguerre\nfunctions with proper asymptotic behavior. Despite its success in reducing both\nmemory requirement and arithmetic complexity, we show that numerical accuracy\nunder prescribed memory variables may deteriorate in time due to the dynamical\nincrements of projection errors. Fortunately, it can be considerably alleviated\nby introducing a suitable scaling factor $\\beta > 1$ and pushing the\ncollocation points closer to origin. An operator splitting scheme is introduced\nto solve the resulting set of equations, where the auxiliary dynamics can be\nsolved exactly, so that it gets rid of the numerical stiffness and\ndiscretization errors. Numerical experiments on both 1-D diffusive wave\nequation and 2-D constant-Q $P$- and $S$-wave equations are presented to\nvalidate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed scheme.",

Though there are works focusing on Sinophobia\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic, less attention has been given to the recent surge\nin Islamophobia. A large number of positive cases arising out of the religious\nTablighi Jamaat gathering has driven people towards forming anti-Muslim\ncommunities around hashtags like #coronajihad, #tablighijamaatvirus on Twitter.\nIn addition to the online spaces, the rise in Islamophobia has also resulted in\nincreased hate crimes in the real world.

To the best of our knowledge, we present the first\nlarge-scale quantitative study linking Islamophobia with COVID-19.\nIn this paper, we present CoronaIslam dataset which focuses on anti-Muslim\nhate spanning four months, with over 410,990 tweets from 244,229 unique users.\nWe use this dataset to perform longitudinal analysis.

Determiningrepository similarity is an essential\nbuilding block in studying the dynamics and the evolution of such software\necosystems. The key challenge is to determine the right representation for the\ndiverse repository features in a way that: (a) it captures all aspects of the\navailable information, and (b) it is readily usable by MLalgorithms. We propose\nRepo2Vec, a comprehensive embedding approach to represent a repository as a\ndistributed vector by combining features from three types of information\nsources. As our key novelty, we consider three types of information:\n(a)metadata, (b) the structure of the repository, and (c) the source code.

We evaluate our method with two real\ndatasets from GitHub for a combined 1013 repositories. First, we show that our\nmethod outperforms previous methods in terms of precision (93%vs 78%), with\nnearly twice as many Strongly Similar repositories and 30% fewer False\nPositives. Second, we show how Repo2Vecprovides a solid basis for: (a)\ndistinguishing between malware and benign repositories, and (b) identifying a\nmeaningful hierarchical clustering.

In addition, most MPI techniques use fixed\ndepth/disparity planes which cannot be modified once the training is complete,\nhence offering very little flexibility at run-time.\nWe propose LiveView - a novel MPI generation and rendering technique that\nproduces high-quality view synthesis in real-time.

The method generates high-quality\nrenderings, while also enabling fast MPI generation and novel view synthesis.\nAs a result, LiveView enables real-time view synthesis applications where an\nMPI needs to be updated frequently based on a video stream of input views.

In this study, we address action prediction by\ninvestigating how action patterns evolve over time in a spatial feature space.\nThere are three key components to our system. First, we work with\nintermediate-layer ConvNet features, which allow for abstraction from raw data,\nwhile retaining spatial layout. Second, instead of propagating features per se,\nwe propagate their residuals across time, which allows for a compact\nrepresentation that reduces redundancy. Third, we employ a Kalman filter to\ncombat error build-up and unify across prediction start times. Extensive\nexperimental results on multiple benchmarks show that our approach leads to\ncompetitive performance in action prediction. Notably, we investigate the\nlearned components of our system to shed light on their otherwise opaque\nnatures in two ways. First, we document that our learned feature propagation\nmodule works as a spatial shifting mechanism under convolution to propagate\ncurrent observations into the future.

    "abstract": "Energy-based models (EBMs) are generative models that are usually trained via\nmaximum likelihood estimation. This approach becomes challenging in generic\nsituations where the trained energy is nonconvex, due to the need to sample the\nGibbs distribution associated with this energy. Using general Fenchel duality\nresults, we derive variational principles dual to maximum likelihood EBMs with\nshallow overparametrized neural network energies, both in the active (aka\nfeature-learning) and lazy regimes. In the active regime, this dual formulation\nleads to a training algorithm in which one updates concurrently the particles\nin the sample space and the neurons in the parameter space of the energy. We\nalso consider a variant of this algorithm in which the particles are sometimes\nrestarted at random samples drawn from the data set, and show that performing\nthese restarts at every iteration step corresponds to score matching training.\nUsing intermediate parameter setups in our dual algorithm thereby gives a way\nto interpolate between maximum likelihood and score matching training. These\nresults are illustrated in simple numerical experiments.",

Action prediction is a major sub-area of\nvideo predictive understanding and is the focus of this review. This sub-area\nhas two major subdivisions: early action recognition and future action\nprediction. Early action recognition is concerned with recognizing an ongoing\naction as soon as possible. Future action prediction is concerned with the\nanticipation of actions that follow those previously observed. In either case,\nthe \\textbf{\\textit{causal}} relationship between the past, current, and\npotential future information is the main focus. Various mathematical tools such\nas Markov Chains, Gaussian Processes, Auto-Regressive modeling, and Bayesian\nrecursive filtering are widely adopted jointly with computer vision techniques\nfor these two tasks. However, these approaches face challenges such as the\ncurse of dimensionality, poor generalization, and constraints from\ndomain-specific knowledge. Recently, structures that rely on deep convolutional\nneural networks and recurrent neural networks have been extensively proposed\nfor improving the performance of existing vision tasks, in general, and action\nprediction tasks, in particular. However, they have their own shortcomings, \\eg\nreliance on massive training data and lack of strong theoretical underpinnings.\nIn this survey, we start by introducing the major sub-areas of the broad area\nof video predictive understanding, which recently have received intensive\nattention and proven to have practical value.

    "abstract": "3D multi-object tracking is a crucial component in the perception system of\nautonomous driving vehicles. Tracking all dynamic objects around the vehicle is\nessential for tasks such as obstacle avoidance and path planning. Autonomous\nvehicles are usually equipped with different sensor modalities to improve\naccuracy and reliability. While sensor fusion has been widely used in object\ndetection networks in recent years, most existing multi-object tracking\nalgorithms either rely on a single input modality, or do not fully exploit the\ninformation provided by multiple sensing modalities. In this work, we propose\nan end-to-end network for joint object detection and tracking based on radar\nand camera sensor fusion. Our proposed method uses a center-based radar-camera\nfusion algorithm for object detection and utilizes a greedy algorithm for\nobject association. The proposed greedy algorithm uses the depth, velocity and\n2D displacement of the detected objects to associate them through time. This\nmakes our tracking algorithm very robust to occluded and overlapping objects,\nas the depth and velocity information can help the network in distinguishing\nthem. We evaluate our method on the challenging nuScenes dataset, where it\nachieves 20.0 AMOTA and outperforms all vision-based 3D tracking methods in the\nbenchmark, as well as the baseline LiDAR-based method. Our method is online\nwith a runtime of 35ms per image, making it very suitable for autonomous\ndriving applications.",

    "abstract": "Over the last few years, neural network derived word embeddings became\npopular in the natural language processing literature. Studies conducted have\nmostly focused on the quality and application of word embeddings trained on\npublic available corpuses such as Wikipedia or other news and social media\nsources. However, these studies are limited to generic text and thus lack\ntechnical and scientific nuances such as domain specific vocabulary,\nabbreviations, or scientific formulas which are commonly used in academic\ncontext. This research focuses on the performance of word embeddings applied to\na large scale academic corpus. More specifically, we compare quality and\nefficiency of trained word embeddings to TFIDF representations in modeling\ncontent of scientific articles. We use a word2vec skip-gram model trained on\ntitles and abstracts of about 70 million scientific articles. Furthermore, we\nhave developed a benchmark to evaluate content models in a scientific context.\nThe benchmark is based on a categorization task that matches articles to\njournals for about 1.3 million articles published in 2017. Our results show\nthat content models based on word embeddings are better for titles (short text)\nwhile TFIDF works better for abstracts (longer text). However, the slight\nimprovement of TFIDF for larger text comes at the expense of 3.7 times more\nmemory requirement as well as up to 184 times higher computation times which\nmay make it inefficient for online applications. In addition, we have created a\n2-dimensional visualization of the journals modeled via embeddings to\nqualitatively inspect embedding model.

However, it is a burden for developers to understand the\npoorly-commented tests, which are common in industry environment projects.\nMobile applications (app) are GUI-intensive and event-driven, so test scripts\nfocusing on GUI interactions play a more important role in mobile app testing\nbesides the test cases for the source code. Therefore, more attention should be\npaid to the user interactions and the corresponding user event responses.\nHowever, test scripts are loosely linked to apps under test (AUT) based on\nwidget selectors, making it hard to map the operations to the functionality\ncode of AUT. In such a situation, code understanding algorithms may lose\nefficacy if directly applied to mobile app test scripts.\nWe present a novel approach, TestIntent, to infer the intent of mobile app\ntest scripts. TestIntent combines the GUI image understanding and code\nunderstanding technologies. The test script is transferred into an operation\nsequence model. For each operation, TestIntent extracts the operated widget\nselector and link the selector to the UI layout structure, which stores the\ndetailed information of the widgets, including coordinates, type, etc. With\ncode understanding technologies, TestIntent can locate response methods in the\nsource code. Afterwards, NLP algorithms are adopted to understand the code and\ngenerate descriptions. Also, TestIntent can locate widgets on the app GUI\nimages. Then, TestIntent can understand the widget intent with an\nencoder-decoder model. With the combination of the results from GUI and code\nunderstanding, TestIntent generates the test intents in natural language\nformat. We also conduct an empirical experiment, and the results prove the\noutstanding performance of TestIntent.

Although the context contains the complete\ndialogue information, the information is usually indirect and even requires\nreasoning to obtain. The information in the lastly predicted dialogue states is\ndirect, but when there is a prediction error, the dialogue information from\nthis source will be incomplete or erroneous.

    "abstract": "Motivated by the societal need to provide fair accessibility or\nrepresentation among groups of agents, we study the group-fair facility\nlocation problems where agents are divided into groups based on criteria such\nas race, gender, or age. The agents are located on a real line, modeling\nagents' private ideal preferences/points for the facility's location (e.g., a\npublic school or representative). Our aim is to design mechanisms to locate a\nfacility to (approximately) minimize the costs of groups of agents to the\nfacility fairly while eliciting the agents' private locations truthfully. We\nfirst introduce various well-motivated group-fair cost objectives and show that\nmany natural objectives have an unbounded approximation ratio. We then consider\nthe objectives of minimizing the maximum total group cost and minimizing the\naverage group cost. For the first objective, we show that the approximation\nratio of the median mechanism depends on the number of groups and provide a new\ngroup-based mechanism with an approximation ratio of 3. For the second\nobjective, the median mechanism obtains a ratio of 3, and we propose a\nrandomized mechanism that obtains a better approximation ratio. We also provide\nlower bounds for both objectives. We then study the notion of intergroup and\nintragroup fairness that measures fairness between groups and within each\ngroup. We consider various objectives and provide mechanisms with tight\napproximation ratios.",

However, it is a nontrivial task for accurate real estate\nappraisal because of three major challenges: (1) The complicated influencing\nfactors for property value; (2) The asynchronously spatiotemporal dependencies\namong real estate transactions; (3) The diversified correlations between\nresidential communities. To this end, we propose a Multi-Task Hierarchical\nGraph Representation Learning (MugRep) framework for accurate real estate\nappraisal. Specifically, by acquiring and integrating multi-source urban data,\nwe first construct a rich feature set to comprehensively profile the real\nestate from multiple perspectives (e.g., geographical distribution, human\nmobility distribution, and resident demographics distribution). Then, an\nevolving real estate transaction graph and a corresponding event graph\nconvolution module are proposed to incorporate asynchronously spatiotemporal\ndependencies among real estate transactions. Moreover, to further incorporate\nvaluable knowledge from the view of residential communities, we devise a\nhierarchical heterogeneous community graph convolution module to capture\ndiversified correlations between residential communities. Finally, an urban\ndistrict partitioned multi-task learning module is introduced to generate\ndifferently distributed value opinions for real estate. Extensive experiments\non two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MugRep and its\ncomponents and features.",

In order to ensure timely delivery of\ninformation to the TBS (from all IoT devices), optimal scheduling of\ntime-sensitive information over two hop UAV-relayed IoT networks (i.e., IoT\ndevice to the UAV [hop 1], and UAV to the TBS [hop 2]) becomes a critical\nchallenge. To address this, we propose scheduling policies for Age of\nInformation (AoI) minimization in such two-hop UAV-relayed IoT networks. To\nthis end, we present a low-complexity MAF-MAD scheduler, that employs Maximum\nAoI First (MAF) policy for sampling of IoT devices at UAV (hop 1) and Maximum\nAoI Difference (MAD) policy for updating sampled packets from UAV to the TBS\n(hop 2). We show that MAF-MAD is the optimal scheduler under ideal conditions,\ni.e., error-free channels and generate-at-will traffic generation at IoT\ndevices. On the contrary, for realistic conditions, we propose a\nDeep-Q-Networks (DQN) based scheduler. Our simulation results show that\nDQN-based scheduler outperforms MAF-MAD scheduler and three other baseline\nschedulers, i.e., Maximal AoI First (MAF), Round Robin (RR) and Random,\nemployed at both hops under general conditions when the network is small (with\n10's of IoT devices). However, it does not scale well with network size whereas\nMAF-MAD outperforms all other schedulers under all considered scenarios for\nlarger networks.",

In this paper, we introduce Split, Embed\nand Merge (SEM), an accurate table structure recognizer. In the first stage, we\nuse the FCN to predict the potential regions of the table row (column)\nseparators, so as to obtain the bounding boxes of the basic grids in the table.\nIn the second stage, we not only extract the visual features corresponding to\neach grid through RoIAlign, but also use the off-the-shelf recognizer and the\nBERT to extract the semantic features. The fused features of both are used to\ncharacterize each table grid. We find that by adding additional semantic\nfeatures to each grid, the ambiguity problem of the table structure from the\nvisual perspective can be solved to a certain extent and achieve higher\nprecision. Finally, we process the merging of these basic grids in a\nself-regression manner. The correspondent merging results is learned by the\nattention maps in attention mechanism. With the proposed method, we can\nrecognize the structure of tables well, even for complex tables.

In this paper, we propose a\nnovel off-policy AC algorithm cautious actor-critic (CAC). The name cautious\ncomes from the doubly conservative nature that we exploit the classic policy\ninterpolation from conservative policy iteration for the actor and the\nentropy-regularization of conservative value iteration for the critic. Our key\nobservation is the entropy-regularized critic facilitates and simplifies the\nunwieldy interpolated actor update while still ensuring robust policy\nimprovement.

    "abstract": "Controlling the model to generate texts of different categories is a\nchallenging task that is getting more and more attention. Recently, generative\nadversarial net (GAN) has shown promising results in category text generation.\nHowever, the texts generated by GANs usually suffer from the problems of mode\ncollapse and training instability. To avoid the above problems, we propose a\nnovel model named category-aware variational recurrent neural network\n(CatVRNN), which is inspired by multi-task learning. In our model, generation\nand classification are trained simultaneously, aiming at generating texts of\ndifferent categories. Moreover, the use of multi-task learning can improve the\nquality of generated texts, when the classification task is appropriate. And we\npropose a function to initialize the hidden state of CatVRNN to force model to\ngenerate texts of a specific category. Experimental results on three datasets\ndemonstrate that our model can do better than several state-of-the-art text\ngeneration methods based GAN in the category accuracy and quality of generated\ntexts.",

    "abstract": "The Panopticon (which means \"watcher of everything\") is a well-known\nstructure of continuous surveillance and discipline proposed by Bentham in\n1785. This device was, later, used by Foucault and other philosophers as a\nparadigm and metaphor for the study of constitutional power and knowledge as\nwell as a model of individuals' deprivation of freedom. Nowadays, technological\nachievements have given rise to new, non-physical (unlike prisons), means of\nconstant surveillance that transcend physical boundaries. This, combined with\nthe confession of some governmental institutions that they actually collaborate\nwith these Internet giants to collect or deduce information about people,\ncreates a worrisome situation of several co-existing Panopticons that can act\nseparately or in close collaboration. Thus, they can only be detected and\nidentified through the expense of (perhaps considerable) effort. In this paper\nwe provide a theoretical framework for studying the detectability status of\nPanopticons that fall under two theoretical, but not unrealistic, definitions.\nWe show, using Oracle Turing Machines, that detecting modern day, ICT-based,\nPanopticons is an undecidable problem. Furthermore, we show that for each\nsufficiently expressive formal system, we can effectively construct a Turing\nMachine for which it is impossible to prove, within the formal system, either\nthat it is a Panopticon or it is not a Panopticon.",

Currently, when sepsis is detected\nand the underlying pathogen is identified, organ damage may have already\nprogressed to irreversible stages. Effective sepsis management is therefore\nhighly time-sensitive. By systematically analysing trends in the plethora of\nclinical data available in the intensive care unit (ICU), an early prediction\nof sepsis could lead to earlier pathogen identification, resistance testing,\nand effective antibiotic and supportive treatment, and thereby become a\nlife-saving measure. Here, we developed and validated a machine learning (ML)\nsystem for the prediction of sepsis in the ICU. Our analysis represents the\nlargest multi-national, multi-centre in-ICU study for sepsis prediction using\nML to date. Our dataset contains $156,309$ unique ICU admissions, which\nrepresent a refined and harmonised subset of five large ICU databases\noriginating from three countries. Using the international consensus definition\nSepsis-3, we derived hourly-resolved sepsis label annotations, amounting to\n$26,734$ ($17.1\\%$) septic stays. We compared our approach, a deep\nself-attention model, to several clinical baselines as well as ML baselines and\nperformed an extensive internal and external validation within and across\ndatabases. On average, our model was able to predict sepsis with an AUROC of\n$0.847 \\pm 0.050$ (internal out-of sample validation) and $0.761 \\pm 0.052$\n(external validation).

    "abstract": "Most of the existing deep learning-based sequential recommendation approaches\nutilize the recurrent neural network architecture or self-attention to model\nthe sequential patterns and temporal influence among a user's historical\nbehavior and learn the user's preference at a specific time. However, these\nmethods have two main drawbacks. First, they focus on modeling users' dynamic\nstates from a user-centric perspective and always neglect the dynamics of items\nover time. Second, most of them deal with only the first-order user-item\ninteractions and do not consider the high-order connectivity between users and\nitems, which has recently been proved helpful for the sequential\nrecommendation. To address the above problems, in this article, we attempt to\nmodel user-item interactions by a bipartite graph structure and propose a new\nrecommendation approach based on a Position-enhanced and Time-aware Graph\nConvolutional Network (PTGCN) for the sequential recommendation. PTGCN models\nthe sequential patterns and temporal dynamics between user-item interactions by\ndefining a position-enhanced and time-aware graph convolution operation and\nlearning the dynamic representations of users and items simultaneously on the\nbipartite graph with a self-attention aggregator. Also, it realizes the\nhigh-order connectivity between users and items by stacking multi-layer graph\nconvolutions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of PTGCN, we carried out a\ncomprehensive evaluation of PTGCN on three real-world datasets of different\nsizes compared with a few competitive baselines.

    "abstract": "Deep-learning-based image processing has emerged as a valuable tool in recent\nyears owing to its high performance. However, the quality of\ndeep-learning-based methods relies heavily on the amount of training data, and\nthe cost of acquiring a large amount of data is often prohibitive in medical\nfields. Therefore, we performed CT modality conversion based on deep learning\nrequiring only a small number of unsupervised images. The proposed method is\nbased on generative adversarial networks (GANs) with several extensions\ntailored for CT images. This method emphasizes the preservation of the\nstructure in the processed images and reduction in the amount of training data.\nThis method was applied to realize the conversion of mega-voltage computed\ntomography (MVCT) to kilo-voltage computed tomography (kVCT) images. Training\nwas performed using several datasets acquired from patients with head and neck\ncancer. The size of the datasets ranged from 16 slices (for two patients) to\n2745 slices (for 137 patients) of MVCT and 2824 slices of kVCT for 98 patients.\nThe quality of the processed MVCT images was considerably enhanced, and the\nstructural changes in the images were minimized. With an increase in the size\nof training data, the image quality exhibited a satisfactory convergence from a\nfew hundred slices. In addition to statistical and visual evaluations, these\nresults were clinically evaluated by medical doctors in terms of the accuracy\nof contouring. We developed an MVCT to kVCT conversion model based on deep\nlearning, which can be trained using a few hundred unpaired images. The\nstability of the model against the change in the data size was demonstrated.\nThis research promotes the reliable use of deep learning in clinical medicine\nby partially answering the commonly asked questions: \"Is our data enough?

However, such one-hot embedding is intrinsically\ntransductive, making these methods with no inductive ability, i.e., failing to\ndeal with new users or new items that are unseen during training. Besides, the\nnumber of model parameters depends on the number of users and items, which is\nexpensive and not scalable. In this paper, we give a formal definition of\ninductive recommendation and solve the above problems by proposing Inductive\nrepresentation based Graph Convolutional Network (IGCN) for collaborative\nfiltering. Specifically, we design an inductive representation layer, which\nutilizes the interaction behavior with core users or items as the initial\nrepresentation, improving the general recommendation performance while bringing\ninductive ability. Note that, the number of parameters of IGCN only depends on\nthe number of core users or items, which is adjustable and scalable.

Operating under such an environment brings several challenges,\nespecially for military communication systems, which need to guarantee reliable\ncommunication while avoiding interfering with other friendly or neutral systems\nand denying the enemy systems of service. In this work, we investigate a novel\napplication of Rate-Splitting Multiple Access(RSMA) for joint communications\nand jamming with a Multi-Carrier(MC) waveform in a multiantenna Cognitive\nRadio(CR) system. RSMA is a robust multiple access scheme for downlink\nmulti-antenna wireless networks. RSMA relies on multi-antenna Rate-Splitting\n(RS) at the transmitter and Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) at the\nreceivers. Our aim is to simultaneously communicate with Secondary Users(SUs)\nand jam Adversarial Users(AUs) to disrupt their communications while limiting\nthe interference to Primary Users(PUs) in a setting where all users perform\nbroadband communications by MC waveforms in their respective networks. We\nconsider the practical setting of imperfect CSI at transmitter(CSIT) for the\nSUs and PUs, and statistical CSIT for AUs. We formulate a problem to obtain\noptimal precoders which maximize the mutual information under interference and\njamming power constraints. We propose an Alternating Optimization-Alternating\nDirection Method of Multipliers(AOADMM) based algorithm for solving the\nresulting non-convex problem. We perform an analysis based on\nKarush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions to determine the optimal jamming and interference\npower thresholds that guarantee the feasibility of problem and propose a\npractical algorithm to calculate the interference power threshold. By\nsimulations, we show that RSMA achieves a higher sum-rate than Space Division\nMultiple Access(SDMA).",

Mammographic findings\nsuch as microcalcifications and masses, as well as morphologic features of\nmasses in sonographic scans, are the main diagnostic targets for tumor\ndetection. However, improved specificity of these imaging modalities is\nrequired. A leading alternative target is neoangiogenesis. When pathological,\nit contributes to the development of numerous types of tumors, and the\nformation of metastases. Hence, demonstrating neoangiogenesis by visualization\nof the microvasculature may be of great importance. Super resolution ultrasound\nlocalization microscopy enables imaging of the microvasculature at the\ncapillary level. Yet, challenges such as long reconstruction time, dependency\non prior knowledge of the system Point Spread Function (PSF), and separability\nof the Ultrasound Contrast Agents (UCAs), need to be addressed for translation\nof super-resolution US into the clinic. In this work we use a deep neural\nnetwork architecture that makes effective use of signal structure to address\nthese challenges. We present in vivo human results of three different breast\nlesions acquired with a clinical US scanner. By leveraging our trained network,\nthe microvasculature structure is recovered in a short time, without prior PSF\nknowledge, and without requiring separability of the UCAs. Each of the\nrecoveries exhibits a different structure that corresponds with the known\nhistological structure.

However, due to human and material resource\nconstraints, the vast majority of remote sensing images remain unlabeled. As a\nresult, it cannot be applied to currently available deep learning methods. To\nfully utilize the remaining unlabeled images, we propose a Geographical\nKnowledge-driven Representation learning method for remote sensing images\n(GeoKR), improving network performance and reduce the demand for annotated\ndata. The global land cover products and geographical location associated with\neach remote sensing image are regarded as geographical knowledge to provide\nsupervision for representation learning and network pre-training. An efficient\npre-training framework is proposed to eliminate the supervision noises caused\nby imaging times and resolutions difference between remote sensing images and\ngeographical knowledge. A large scale pre-training dataset Levir-KR is proposed\nto support network pre-training. It contains 1,431,950 remote sensing images\nfrom Gaofen series satellites with various resolutions. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our proposed method outperforms ImageNet pre-training and\nself-supervised representation learning methods and significantly reduces the\nburden of data annotation on downstream tasks such as scene classification,\nsemantic segmentation, object detection, and cloud / snow detection.

    "abstract": "The safety assessment of automated vehicles (AVs) is an important aspect of\nthe development cycle of AVs. A scenario-based assessment approach is accepted\nby many players in the field as part of the complete safety assessment. A\nscenario is a representation of a situation on the road to which the AV needs\nto respond appropriately. One way to generate the required scenario-based test\ndescriptions is to parameterize the scenarios and to draw these parameters from\na probability density function (pdf). Because the shape of the pdf is unknown\nbeforehand, assuming a functional form of the pdf and fitting the parameters to\nthe data may lead to inaccurate fits. As an alternative, Kernel Density\nEstimation (KDE) is a promising candidate for estimating the underlying pdf,\nbecause it is flexible with the underlying distribution of the parameters.\nDrawing random samples from a pdf estimated with KDE is possible without the\nneed of evaluating the actual pdf, which makes it suitable for drawing random\nsamples for, e.g., Monte Carlo methods. Sampling from a KDE while the samples\nsatisfy a linear equality constraint, however, has not been described in the\nliterature, as far as the authors know.\nIn this paper, we propose a method to sample from a pdf estimated using KDE,\nsuch that the samples satisfy a linear equality constraint. We also present an\nalgorithm of our method in pseudo-code. The method can be used to generating\nscenarios that have, e.g., a predetermined starting speed or to generate\ndifferent types of scenarios. This paper also shows that the method for\nsampling scenarios can be used in case a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is\nused to reduce the dimension of the parameter vectors.",

Thin\nfilament-like structures are mathematically just 1D curves embedded in R^3, and\nintegration-based reconstruction works best when depth sequences (from the thin\nstructure parts) are fused using the object's (unknown) curve skeleton. Thus,\nusing the complementary but noisy color and depth channels, CurveFusion first\nautomatically identifies point samples on potential thin structures and groups\nthem into bundles, each being a group of a fixed number of aligned consecutive\nframes. Then, the algorithm extracts per-bundle skeleton curves using L1 axes,\nand aligns and iteratively merges the L1 segments from all the bundles to form\nthe final complete curve skeleton. Thus, unlike previous methods,\nreconstruction happens via integration along a data-dependent fusion primitive,\ni.e., the extracted curve skeleton. We extensively evaluate CurveFusion on a\nrange of challenging examples, different scanner and calibration settings, and\npresent high fidelity thin structure reconstructions previously just not\npossible from raw RGBD sequences.",

Thus, there is a tradeoff between obtaining\nlarge reward and incurring sampling cost as a function of the sampling\nfrequency. The goal is to design a learning algorithm that minimizes regret,\nthat is defined as the difference of the payoff of the oracle policy and that\nof the learning algorithm. CTMAB is fundamentally different than the usual\nmulti-arm bandit problem (MAB), e.g., even the single-arm case is non-trivial\nin CTMAB, since the optimal sampling frequency depends on the mean of the arm,\nwhich needs to be estimated. We first establish lower bounds on the regret\nachievable with any algorithm and then propose algorithms that achieve the\nlower bound up to logarithmic factors. For the single-arm case, we show that\nthe lower bound on the regret is $\\Omega((\\log T)^2/\\mu)$, where $\\mu$ is the\nmean of the arm, and $T$ is the time horizon.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a conceptual framework for the analysis of reward sharing\nschemes in mining pools, such as those associated with Bitcoin. The framework\nis centered around the reported shares in a pool instead of agents and results\nin two new fairness criteria, absolute and relative redistribution. These\ncriteria impose that the addition of a share to the pool affects all previous\nshares in the same way, either in absolute amount or in relative ratio. We\ncharacterize two large classes of economically viable reward sharing schemes\ncorresponding to each of these fairness criteria in turn. We further show that\nthe intersection of these classes brings about a generalization of the\nwell-known proportional scheme, which also leads to a new characterization of\nthe proportional scheme as a corollary.",

However, vast computation complexity and memory occupation hampers\nthe edge of deplorability and the runtime inference in real-life applications,\nespecially for large-scale VSR task. This paper explores the possibility of\nreal-time VSR system and designs an efficient and generic VSR network, termed\nEGVSR. The proposed EGVSR is based on spatio-temporal adversarial learning for\ntemporal coherence. In order to pursue faster VSR processing ability up to 4K\nresolution, this paper tries to choose lightweight network structure and\nefficient upsampling method to reduce the computation required by EGVSR network\nunder the guarantee of high visual quality. Besides, we implement the batch\nnormalization computation fusion, convolutional acceleration algorithm and\nother neural network acceleration techniques on the actual hardware platform to\noptimize the inference process of EGVSR network. Finally, our EGVSR achieves\nthe real-time processing capacity of 4K@29.61FPS. Compared with TecoGAN, the\nmost advanced VSR network at present, we achieve 85.04% reduction of\ncomputation density and 7.92x performance speedups. In terms of visual quality,\nthe proposed EGVSR tops the list of most metrics (such as LPIPS, tOF, tLP,\netc.) on the public test dataset Vid4 and surpasses other state-of-the-art\nmethods in overall performance score.

    "abstract": "Recommending cold-start items is a long-standing and fundamental challenge in\nrecommender systems. Without any historical interaction on cold-start items, CF\nscheme fails to use collaborative signals to infer user preference on these\nitems. To solve this problem, extensive studies have been conducted to\nincorporate side information into the CF scheme. Specifically, they employ\nmodern neural network techniques (e.g., dropout, consistency constraint) to\ndiscover and exploit the coalition effect of content features and collaborative\nrepresentations. However, we argue that these works less explore the mutual\ndependencies between content features and collaborative representations and\nlack sufficient theoretical supports, thus resulting in unsatisfactory\nperformance. In this work, we reformulate the cold-start item representation\nlearning from an information-theoretic standpoint. It aims to maximize the\nmutual dependencies between item content and collaborative signals.\nSpecifically, the representation learning is theoretically lower-bounded by the\nintegration of two terms: mutual information between collaborative embeddings\nof users and items, and mutual information between collaborative embeddings and\nfeature representations of items. To model such a learning process, we devise a\nnew objective function founded upon contrastive learning and develop a simple\nyet effective Contrastive Learning-based Cold-start Recommendation\nframework(CLCRec). In particular, CLCRec consists of three components:\ncontrastive pair organization, contrastive embedding, and contrastive\noptimization modules. It allows us to preserve collaborative signals in the\ncontent representations for both warm and cold-start items. Through extensive\nexperiments on four publicly accessible datasets, we observe that CLCRec\nachieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches in both\nwarm- and cold-start scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Today, payment paths in Bitcoin's Lightning Network are found by searching\nfor shortest paths on the fee graph. We enhance this approach in two\ndimensions. Firstly, we take into account the probability of a payment actually\nbeing possible due to the unknown balance distributions in the channels.\nSecondly, we use minimum cost flows as a proper generalization of shortest\npaths to multi-part payments (MPP). In particular we show that under plausible\nassumptions about the balance distributions we can find the most likely MPP for\nany given set of senders, recipients and amounts by solving for a (generalized)\ninteger minimum cost flow with a separable and convex cost function. Polynomial\ntime exact algorithms as well as approximations are known for this optimization\nproblem. We present a round-based algorithm of min-cost flow computations for\ndelivering large payment amounts over the Lightning Network. This algorithm\nworks by updating the probability distributions with the information gained\nfrom both successful and unsuccessful paths on prior rounds. In all our\nexperiments a single digit number of rounds sufficed to deliver payments of\nsizes that were close to the total local balance of the sender. Early\nexperiments indicate that our approach increases the size of payments that can\nbe reliably delivered by several orders of magnitude compared to the current\nstate of the art. We observe that finding the cheapest multi-part payments is\nan NP-hard problem considering the current fee structure and propose dropping\nthe base fee to make it a linear min-cost flow problem. Finally, we discuss\npossibilities for maximizing the probability while at the same time minimizing\nthe fees of a flow. While this turns out to be a hard problem in general as\nwell - even in the single path case - it appears to be surprisingly tractable\nin practice.",

Granger causality is a practical framework\nfor analyzing the interactions from observed time-series data; however, this\nframework ignores the structures of the generative process in animal behaviors,\nwhich may lead to interpretational problems and sometimes erroneous assessments\nof causality. In this paper, we propose a new framework for learning Granger\ncausality from multi-animal trajectories via augmented theory-based behavioral\nmodels with interpretable data-driven models.

Among\nthe studies in the SBR field, graph-based approaches are a relatively powerful\nkind of way, which generally extract item information by message aggregation\nunder Euclidean space. However, such methods can't effectively extract the\nhierarchical information contained among consecutive items in a session, which\nis critical to represent users' preferences. In this paper, we present a\nhyperbolic contrastive graph recommender (HCGR), a principled session-based\nrecommendation framework involving Lorentz hyperbolic space to adequately\ncapture the coherence and hierarchical representations of the items. Within\nthis framework, we design a novel adaptive hyperbolic attention computation to\naggregate the graph message of each user's preference in a session-based\nbehavior sequence. In addition, contrastive learning is leveraged to optimize\nthe item representation by considering the geodesic distance between positive\nand negative samples in hyperbolic space.

    "abstract": "Commit messages are natural language descriptions of code changes, which are\nimportant for program understanding and maintenance. However, writing commit\nmessages manually is time-consuming and laborious, especially when the code is\nupdated frequently. Various approaches utilizing generation or retrieval\ntechniques have been proposed to automatically generate commit messages. To\nachieve a better understanding of how the existing approaches perform in\nsolving this problem, this paper conducts a systematic and in-depth analysis of\nthe state-of-the-art models and datasets. We find that: (1) Different variants\nof the BLEU metric are used in previous works, which affects the evaluation and\nunderstanding of existing methods. (2) Most existing datasets are crawled only\nfrom Java repositories while repositories in other programming languages are\nnot sufficiently explored. (3) Dataset splitting strategies can influence the\nperformance of existing models by a large margin. Some models show better\nperformance when the datasets are split by commit, while other models perform\nbetter when the datasets are split by timestamp or by project. Based on our\nfindings, we conduct a human evaluation and find the BLEU metric that best\ncorrelates with the human scores for the task. We also collect a large-scale,\ninformation-rich, and multi-language commit message dataset MCMD and evaluate\nexisting models on this dataset. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments\nunder different dataset splitting strategies and suggest the suitable models\nunder different scenarios. Based on the experimental results and findings, we\nprovide feasible suggestions for comprehensively evaluating commit message\ngeneration models and discuss possible future research directions.

However, recent studies have shown that this top-down approach is not\nsuitable for the implementation and testing of modern automotive systems.\nSpecifically, practitioners increasingly fail to specify requirements and tests\nfor systems with complex component interactions (e.g., e-mobility systems). In\nthis paper, we address this research gap and propose an integrated and\niterative scenario-based technique for the specification of requirements and\ntest scenarios. Our idea is to combine both a top-down and a bottom-up\nintegration strategy. For the top-down approach, we use a behavior-driven\ndevelopment (BDD) technique to drive the modeling of high-level system\ninteractions from the user's perspective. For the bottom-up approach, we\ndiscovered that natural language processing (NLP) techniques are suited to make\ntextual specifications of existing components accessible to our technique. To\nintegrate both directions, we support the joint execution and automated\nanalysis of system-level interactions and component-level behavior. We\ndemonstrate the feasibility of our approach by conducting a case study at\nKostal (Tier1 supplier).

Core component of the decoding algorithm is a\nprocess of maximization of a fitness function which aims to find most optimal\nset of substitution rules allowing to transcribe the part of the manuscript --\nwhich we call the Calendar -- into lists of feminine names. This leads to sets\nof character subsitution rules which allow us to consistently transcribe dozens\namong three hundred calendar tokens into feminine names: a result far\nsurpassing both ``popular'' as well as \"state of the art\" tentatives to crack\nthe manuscript. What's more, by using name lists stemming from different\nlanguages as potential cribs, our ``adaptive'' method can also be useful in\nidentification of the language in which the manuscript is written.\nAs far as we can currently tell, results of our experiments indicate that the\nCalendar part of the manuscript contains names from baltoslavic, balkanic or\nhebrew language strata. Two further indications are also given: primo, highest\nfitness values were obtained when the crib list contains names with specific\ninfixes at token's penultimate position as is the case, for example, for slavic\n\\textbf{feminine diminutives} (i.e. names ending with -ka and not -a). In the\nmost successful scenario, 240 characters contained in 35 distinct Voynichese\ntokens were successfully transcribed.

In spontaneous speech tasks, various speech phenomena such as\nfillers, word fragments, laughter and coughs, etc. are often included. While\ncommon transcriptions do not give special awareness to these phenomena, rich\ntranscriptions explicitly convert them into special phenomenon tokens as well\nas textual tokens. In previous studies, the textual and phenomenon tokens were\nsimultaneously estimated in an end-to-end manner. However, it is difficult to\nbuild accurate RT-ASR systems because large-scale rich transcription-style\ndatasets are often unavailable. To solve this problem, our training method uses\na limited rich transcription-style dataset and common transcription-style\ndataset simultaneously. The Key process in our semi-supervised learning is to\nconvert the common transcription-style dataset into a pseudo-rich\ntranscription-style dataset. To this end, we introduce style tokens which\ncontrol phenomenon tokens are generated or not into transformer-based\nautoregressive modeling. We use this modeling for generating the pseudo-rich\ntranscription-style datasets and for building RT-ASR system from the pseudo and\noriginal datasets.

    "abstract": "Social media are an essential source of meaningful data that can be used in\ndifferent tasks such as sentiment analysis and emotion recognition. Mostly,\nthese tasks are solved with deep learning methods. Due to the fuzzy nature of\ntextual data, we consider using classification methods based on fuzzy rough\nsets. Specifically, we develop an approach for the SemEval-2018 emotion\ndetection task, based on the fuzzy rough nearest neighbour (FRNN) classifier\nenhanced with ordered weighted average (OWA) operators. We use tuned ensembles\nof FRNN--OWA models based on different text embedding methods. Our results are\ncompetitive with the best SemEval solutions based on more complicated deep\nlearning methods.",

    "abstract": "The importance of parameter selection in supervised learning is well known.\nHowever, due to the many parameter combinations, an incomplete or an\ninsufficient procedure is often applied. This situation may cause misleading or\nconfusing conclusions. In this opinion paper, through an intriguing example we\npoint out that the seriousness goes beyond what is generally recognized. In the\ntopic of multi-label classification for medical code prediction, one\ninfluential paper conducted a proper parameter selection on a set, but when\nmoving to a subset of frequently occurring labels, the authors used the same\nparameters without a separate tuning. The set of frequent labels became a\npopular benchmark in subsequent studies, which kept pushing the state of the\nart. However, we discovered that most of the results in these studies cannot\nsurpass the approach in the original paper if a parameter tuning had been\nconducted at the time. Thus it is unclear how much progress the subsequent\ndevelopments have actually brought. The lesson clearly indicates that without\nenough attention on parameter selection, the research progress in our field can\nbe uncertain or even illusive.",

We address this issue by collecting SynLiDAR, a\nsynthetic LiDAR point cloud dataset that contains large-scale point-wise\nannotated point cloud with accurate geometric shapes and comprehensive semantic\nclasses, and designing PCT-Net, a point cloud translation network that aims to\nnarrow down the gap with real-world point cloud data. For SynLiDAR, we leverage\ngraphic tools and professionals who construct multiple realistic virtual\nenvironments with rich scene types and layouts where annotated LiDAR points can\nbe generated automatically. On top of that, PCT-Net disentangles\nsynthetic-to-real gaps into an appearance component and a sparsity component\nand translates SynLiDAR by aligning the two components with real-world data\nseparately. Extensive experiments over multiple data augmentation and\nsemi-supervised semantic segmentation tasks show very positive outcomes -\nincluding SynLiDAR can either train better models or reduce real-world\nannotated data without sacrificing performance, and PCT-Net translated data\nfurther improve model performance consistently.",

When\ncombined with function approximation, such as neural networks, this combination\nis known as the deadly triad and is potentially unstable.

In this paper we investigate how to combine\nemphatic weightings with non-sequential, off-line data sampled from a replay\nbuffer.

    "abstract": "Recently, word enhancement has become very popular for Chinese Named Entity\nRecognition (NER), reducing segmentation errors and increasing the semantic and\nboundary information of Chinese words. However, these methods tend to ignore\nthe information of the Chinese character structure after integrating the\nlexical information. Chinese characters have evolved from pictographs since\nancient times, and their structure often reflects more information about the\ncharacters. This paper presents a novel Multi-metadata Embedding based\nCross-Transformer (MECT) to improve the performance of Chinese NER by fusing\nthe structural information of Chinese characters. Specifically, we use\nmulti-metadata embedding in a two-stream Transformer to integrate Chinese\ncharacter features with the radical-level embedding. With the structural\ncharacteristics of Chinese characters, MECT can better capture the semantic\ninformation of Chinese characters for NER. The experimental results obtained on\nseveral well-known benchmarking datasets demonstrate the merits and superiority\nof the proposed MECT method.\\footnote{The source code of the proposed method is\npublicly available at https://github.com/CoderMusou/MECT4CNER.",

We further examine the roles of\nnetwork capacity, task grouping, and dynamic loss weighting in reducing\ninterference and facilitating transfer. We demonstrate our findings on the\nCIFAR-100, MiniPlaces, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets.",

    "abstract": "Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt a model trained on\nlabelled data in a source domain to unlabelled data in a target domain without\naccess to the source-domain data during adaptation. Existing methods for SFDA\nleverage entropy-minimization techniques which: (i) apply only to\nclassification; (ii) destroy model calibration; and (iii) rely on the source\nmodel achieving a good level of feature-space class-separation in the target\ndomain. We address these issues for a particularly pervasive type of domain\nshift called measurement shift, characterized by a change in measurement system\n(e.g. a change in sensor or lighting). In the source domain, we store a\nlightweight and flexible approximation of the feature distribution under the\nsource data. In the target domain, we adapt the feature-extractor such that the\napproximate feature distribution under the target data realigns with that saved\non the source. We call this method Feature Restoration (FR) as it seeks to\nextract features with the same semantics from the target domain as were\npreviously extracted from the source. We additionally propose Bottom-Up Feature\nRestoration (BUFR), a bottom-up training scheme for FR which boosts performance\nby preserving learnt structure in the later layers of a network. Through\nexperiments we demonstrate that BUFR often outperforms existing SFDA methods in\nterms of accuracy, calibration, and data efficiency, while being less reliant\non the performance of the source model in the target domain.",

One of the most effective way to combat the harmful species\nis to locate and destroy their nests. By mobilizing the public to actively\nreport possible sightings of the Asian giant hornet, the governmentcould timely\nsend inspectors to confirm and possibly destroy the nests. However, such\nconfirmation requires lab expertise, where manually checking the reports one by\none is extremely consuming of human resources. Further given the limited\nknowledge of the public about the Asian giant hornet and the randomness of\nreport submission, only few of the numerous reports proved positive, i.e.\nexisting nests. How to classify or prioritize the reports efficiently and\nautomatically, so as to determine the dispatch of personnel, is of great\nsignificance to the control of the Asian giant hornet.

This paper proposes a learning and\nadaptation framework in which the dynamics of the communication beams are\nlearned and then exploited to design adaptive beam-training with low overhead:\non a long-timescale, a deep recurrent variational autoencoder (DR-VAE) uses\nnoisy beam-training observations to learn a probabilistic model of beam\ndynamics; on a short-timescale, an adaptive beam-training procedure is\nformulated as a partially observable (PO-) Markov decision process (MDP) and\noptimized via point-based value iteration (PBVI) by leveraging beam-training\nfeedback and a probabilistic prediction of the strongest beam pair provided by\nthe DR-VAE. In turn, beam-training observations are used to refine the DR-VAE\nvia stochastic gradient ascent in a continuous process of learning and\nadaptation. The proposed DR-VAE mobility learning framework learns accurate\nbeam dynamics: it reduces the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the ground\ntruth and the learned beam dynamics model by 86% over the Baum-Welch algorithm\nand by 92\\% over a naive mobility learning approach that neglects feedback\nerrors. The proposed dual-timescale approach yields a negligible loss of\nspectral efficiency compared to a genie-aided scheme operating under error-free\nfeedback and foreknown mobility model. Finally, a low-complexity policy is\nproposed by reducing the POMDP to an error-robust MDP. It is shown that the\nPBVI- and error-robust MDP-based policies improve the spectral efficiency by\n85% and 67%, respectively, over a policy that scans exhaustively over the\ndominant beam pairs, and by 16% and 7%, respectively, over a state-of-the-art\nPOMDP policy.",

Unfortunately, commercially available NN\naccelerators only expose computation capabilities through AI/ML-specific\ninterfaces.

    "title": "Denoising User-aware Memory Network for Recommendation",
    "abstract": "For better user satisfaction and business effectiveness, more and more\nattention has been paid to the sequence-based recommendation system, which is\nused to infer the evolution of users' dynamic preferences, and recent studies\nhave noticed that the evolution of users' preferences can be better understood\nfrom the implicit and explicit feedback sequences. However, most of the\nexisting recommendation techniques do not consider the noise contained in\nimplicit feedback, which will lead to the biased representation of user\ninterest and a suboptimal recommendation performance. Meanwhile, the existing\nmethods utilize item sequence for capturing the evolution of user interest. The\nperformance of these methods is limited by the length of the sequence, and can\nnot effectively model the long-term interest in a long period of time. Based on\nthis observation, we propose a novel CTR model named denoising user-aware\nmemory network (DUMN). Specifically, the framework: (i) proposes a feature\npurification module based on orthogonal mapping, which use the representation\nof explicit feedback to purify the representation of implicit feedback, and\neffectively denoise the implicit feedback; (ii) designs a user memory network\nto model the long-term interests in a fine-grained way by improving the memory\nnetwork, which is ignored by the existing methods; and (iii) develops a\npreference-aware interactive representation component to fuse the long-term and\nshort-term interests of users based on gating to understand the evolution of\nunbiased preferences of users. Extensive experiments on two real e-commerce\nuser behavior datasets show that DUMN has a significant improvement over the\nstate-of-the-art baselines. The code of DUMN model has been uploaded as an\nadditional material.",

    "abstract": "Transformers are more and more popular in computer vision, which treat an\nimage as a sequence of patches and learn robust global features from the\nsequence. However, a suitable vehicle re-identification method should consider\nboth robust global features and discriminative local features. In this paper,\nwe propose a graph interactive transformer (GiT) for vehicle re-identification.\nOn the whole, we stack multiple GiT blocks to build a competitive vehicle\nre-identification model, in where each GiT block employs a novel local\ncorrelation graph (LCG) module to extract discriminative local features within\npatches and uses a transformer layer to extract robust global features among\npatches. In detail, in the current GiT block, the LCG module learns local\nfeatures from local and global features resulting from the LCG module and\ntransformer layer of the previous GiT block. Similarly, the transformer layer\nlearns global features from the global features generated by the transformer\nlayer of the previous GiT block and the new local features outputted via the\nLCG module of the current GiT block. Therefore, LCG modules and transformer\nlayers are in a coupled status, bringing effective cooperation between local\nand global features. This is the first work to combine graphs and transformers\nfor vehicle re-identification to the best of our knowledge. Extensive\nexperiments on three large-scale vehicle re-identification datasets demonstrate\nthat our method is superior to state-of-the-art approaches. The code will be\navailable soon.",

Nevertheless, the boundaries of these\nmethods for CSPs with non-Boolean domain are not well-understood. Our goal in\nthis paper is to fill in this gap and obtain strong inapproximability results\nby studying the prototypical problem in this class of CSPs, hypergraph\ncolourings.\nMore precisely, we focus on the problem of approximately counting\n$q$-colourings on $K$-uniform hypergraphs with bounded degree $\\Delta$. An\nefficient algorithm exists if $\\Delta\\lesssim \\frac{q^{K/3-1}}{4^KK^2}$ (Jain,\nPham, and Voung, 2021; He, Sun, and Wu, 2021). Somewhat surprisingly however, a\nhardness bound is not known even for the easier problem of finding colourings.\nFor the counting problem, the situation is even less clear and there is no\nevidence of the right constant controlling the growth of the exponent in terms\nof $K$.\nTo this end, we first establish that for general $q$ computational hardness\nfor finding a colouring on simple/linear hypergraphs occurs at $\\Delta\\gtrsim\nKq^K$, almost matching the algorithm from the Lovasz Local Lemma. Our second\nand main contribution is to obtain a far more refined bound for the counting\nproblem that goes well beyond the hardness of finding a colouring and which we\nconjecture that is asymptotically tight (up to constant factors). We show in\nparticular that for all even $q\\geq 4$ it is NP-hard to approximate the number\nof colourings when $\\Delta\\gtrsim q^{K/2}$.",

This paper demonstrates the capabilities of\ngradient boosting regression for predicting the SoH timeseries under\ncircumstances when there is little prior information available about the\nbatteries. We compared the gradient boosting method with light gradient\nboosting, extra trees, extreme gradient boosting, random forests, long\nshort-term memory networks and with combined convolutional neural network and\nlong short-term memory networks methods. We used multiple predictors and lagged\ntarget signal decomposition results as additional predictors and compared the\nyielded prediction results with different sets of predictors for each method.\nFor this work, we are in possession of a unique data set of 45 lithium-ion\nbattery packs with large variation in the data. The best model that we derived\nwas validated by a novel walk-forward algorithm that also calculates point-wise\nconfidence intervals for the predictions; we yielded reasonable predictions and\nconfidence intervals for the predictions. Furthermore, we verified this model\nagainst five other lithium-ion battery packs; the best model generalised to\ngreater extent to this set of battery packs. The results about the final model\nsuggest that we were able to enhance the results in respect to previously\ndeveloped models. Moreover, we further validated the model for extracting cycle\ncounts presented in our previous work with data from new forklifts; their\nbattery packs completed around 3000 cycles in a 10-year service period, which\ncorresponds to the cycle life for commercial Nickel-Cobalt-Manganese (NMC)\ncells.",

However, there are two major sources of overhead\nin PGAS runtimes that prevent them from achieving acceptable performance on\nlarge scale parallel systems. First, despite the availability of APIs that\nsupport non-blocking operations for important special cases, many PGAS\noperations on remote locations are synchronous by default, which can lead to\nlong-latency stalls. Second, efficient inter-node communication requires\ncareful aggregation and management of short messages. Experiments has shown\nthat the performance of PGAS programs can be improved by more than 20$\\times$\nthrough the use of specialized lower-level libraries, such as Conveyors, but\nwith a significant impact on programming productivity.\nThe actor model has been gaining popularity in many modern programming\nlanguages such as Scala or Rust and also within the cloud computing community.\nIn this paper, we introduce a new programming system for PGAS runtimes, in\nwhich all remote operations are asynchronous by default through the use of an\nactor-based programming system. In this approach, the programmer does not need\nto worry about complexities related to message aggregation and termination\ndetection. Thus, our approach offers a desirable point in the\nproductivity-performance spectrum, with scalable performance that approaches\nthat of lower-level aggregation libraries but with higher productivity.",

    "title": "Routing in Strongly Hyperbolic Unit Disk Graphs",
    "abstract": "Greedy routing has been studied successfully on Euclidean unit disk graphs,\nwhich we interpret as a special case of hyperbolic unit disk graphs. While\nsparse Euclidean unit disk graphs exhibit grid-like structure, we introduce\nstrongly hyperbolic unit disk graphs as the natural counterpart containing\ngraphs that have hierarchical network structures.\nWe develop and analyze a routing scheme that utilizes these hierarchies. On\narbitrary graphs this scheme guarantees a worst case stretch of $\\max\\{3,\n1+2b/a\\}$ for $a > 0$ and $b > 1$. Moreover, it stores $\\mathcal{O}(k(\\log^2{n}\n+ \\log{k}))$ bits at each vertex and takes $\\mathcal{O}(k)$ time for a routing\ndecision, where $k = \\pi e (1 + a)/(2(b - 1)) (b^2 \\text{diam}(G) - 1) R +\n\\log_b(\\text{diam}(G)) + 1$, on strongly hyperbolic unit disk graphs with\nthreshold radius $R > 0$. In particular, for hyperbolic random graphs, which\nhave previously been used to model hierarchical networks like the internet, $k\n= \\mathcal{O}(\\log^2{n})$ holds asymptotically almost surely. Thus, we obtain a\nworst-case stretch of $3$, $\\mathcal{O}(\\log^4 n)$ bits of storage per vertex,\nand $\\mathcal{O}(\\log^2 n)$ time per routing decision on such networks. This\nbeats existing worst-case lower bounds. Our proof of concept implementation\nindicates that the obtained results translate well to real-world networks.",

Binarized neural networks (BNNs), which\nutilize single-bit weights, represent an efficient way to implement and deploy\nneural network models on accelerators.

We\nperform detailed fabrication-process variation analyses at the optical device\nlevel, explore efficient corrective tuning for these devices, and integrate\ncircuit-level optimization to counter thermal variations. As a result, our\nproposed ROBIN architecture possesses the desirable traits of being robust,\nenergy-efficient, low latency, and high throughput, when executing BNN models.\nOur analysis shows that ROBIN can outperform the best-known optical BNN\naccelerators and also many electronic accelerators. Specifically, our\nenergy-efficient ROBIN design exhibits energy-per-bit values that are ~4x lower\nthan electronic BNN accelerators and ~933x lower than a recently proposed\nphotonic BNN accelerator, while a performance-efficient ROBIN design shows ~3x\nand ~25x better performance than electronic and photonic BNN accelerators,\nrespectively.",

As a well-known\nsolution, locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) is able to answer c-approximate NN\n(c-ANN) queries in sublinear time with constant probability. Existing LSH\nmethods focus mainly on building hash bucket-based indexing such that the\ncandidate points can be retrieved quickly. However, existing coarse-grained\nstructures fail to offer accurate distance estimation for candidate points,\nwhich translates into additional computational overhead when having to examine\nunnecessary points. This in turn reduces the performance of query processing.\nIn contrast, we propose a fast and accurate in-memory LSH framework, called\nPM-LSH, that aims to compute c-ANN queries on large-scale, high-dimensional\ndatasets. First, we adopt a simple yet effective PM-tree to index the data\npoints. Second, we develop a tunable confidence interval to achieve accurate\ndistance estimation and guarantee high result quality. Third, we propose an\nefficient algorithm on top of the PM-tree to improve the performance of\ncomputing c-ANN queries. In addition, we extend PM-LSH to support closest pair\n(CP) search in high-dimensional spaces. We again adopt the PM-tree to organize\nthe points in a lowdimensional space, and we propose a branch and bound\nalgorithm together with a radius pruning technique to improve the performance\nof computing c-approximate closest pair (c-ACP) queries.

Under the criterion that stipulates minimization of the\nType II error exponent subject to a (constant) upper bound $\\epsilon$ on the\nType I error rate, we characterize the set of encoding rates and exponent for\nboth discrete memoryless and memoryless vector Gaussian settings. For the DM\nsetting, we provide a converse proof and show that it is achieved using the\nQuantize-Bin-Test scheme of Rahman and Wagner. For the memoryless vector\nGaussian setting, we develop a tight outer bound by means of a technique that\nrelies on the de Bruijn identity and the properties of Fisher information. In\nparticular, the result shows that for memoryless vector Gaussian sources the\nrate-exponent region is exhausted using the Quantize-Bin-Test scheme with\nGaussian test channels; and there is no loss in performance caused by\nrestricting the sensors' encoders not to employ time sharing. Furthermore, we\nalso study a variant of the problem in which the source, not necessarily\nGaussian, has finite differential entropy and the sensors' observations noises\nunder the null hypothesis are Gaussian. For this model, our main result is an\nupper bound on the exponent-rate function.

    "abstract": "Modern vehicles can be thought of as complex distributed embedded systems\nthat run a variety of automotive applications with real-time constraints.\nRecent advances in the automotive industry towards greater autonomy are driving\nvehicles to be increasingly connected with various external systems (e.g.,\nroadside beacons, other vehicles), which makes emerging vehicles highly\nvulnerable to cyber-attacks. Additionally, the increased complexity of\nautomotive applications and the in-vehicle networks results in poor attack\nvisibility, which makes detecting such attacks particularly challenging in\nautomotive systems. In this work, we present a novel anomaly detection\nframework called LATTE to detect cyber-attacks in Controller Area Network (CAN)\nbased networks within automotive platforms. Our proposed LATTE framework uses a\nstacked Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) predictor network with novel attention\nmechanisms to learn the normal operating behavior at design time. Subsequently,\na novel detection scheme (also trained at design time) is used to detect\nvarious cyber-attacks (as anomalies) at runtime. We evaluate our proposed LATTE\nframework under different automotive attack scenarios and present a detailed\ncomparison with the best-known prior works in this area, to demonstrate the\npotential of our approach.",

    "abstract": "Mobile robots have disrupted the material handling industry which is\nwitnessing radical changes. The requirement for enhanced automation across\nvarious industry segments often entails mobile robotic systems operating in\nlogistics facilities with little/no infrastructure. In such environments,\nout-of-box low-cost robotic solutions are desirable. Wireless connectivity\nplays a crucial role in successful operation of such mobile robotic systems. A\nwireless mesh network of mobile robots is an attractive solution; however, a\nnumber of system-level challenges create unique and stringent service\nrequirements. The focus of this paper is the role of Bluetooth mesh technology,\nwhich is the latest addition to the Internet-of-Things (IoT) connectivity\nlandscape, in addressing the challenges of infrastructure-less connectivity for\nmobile robotic systems. It articulates the key system-level design challenges\nfrom communication, control, cooperation, coverage, security, and\nnavigation/localization perspectives, and explores different capabilities of\nBluetooth mesh technology for such challenges. It also provides performance\ninsights through real-world experimental evaluation of Bluetooth mesh while\ninvestigating its differentiating features against competing solutions.",

The first\ntype of error, falsity of facts, is addressed by property graphs through the\nrepresentation of provenance and validity, making triples occur as first-order\nobjects in subject position of metadata triples. The second type of error,\nviolation of domain constraints, has not been addressed with regard to property\ngraphs so far. In RDF representations, this error can be addressed by shape\nlanguages such as SHACL or ShEx, which allow for checking whether graphs are\nvalid with respect to a set of domain constraints. Borrowing ideas from the\nsyntax and semantics definitions of SHACL, we design a shape language for\nproperty graphs, ProGS, which allows for formulating shape constraints on\nproperty graphs including their specific constructs, such as edges with\nidentities and key-value annotations to both nodes and edges.

Between these two thresholds, we show that the MLE makes\n$n^{\\delta + o(1)}$ errors for an explicit $\\delta \\in (0, 1)$. These results\nextend to the geometric setting a recent line of work on recovering matchings\nplanted in random graphs with independently-weighted edges.

Although\ntheir numerical modeling have come a long way, the application of numerical\ndesign tools to these multiphysics problems is still lagging behind.\nGradient-based optimization is the most popular approach in topology\noptimization currently. Hence, it's a necessity to utilize mesh deformation\ntechniques that have continuous, smooth derivatives. In this work, we discuss\nmesh deformation techniques for structured, quadrilateral meshes. We discuss\nand comment on two legacy mesh deformation techniques; namely the spring\nanalogy model and the linear elasticity model. In addition, we propose a new\ntechnique based on the Yeoh hyperelasticity model. We focus on mesh quality as\na gateway to mesh admissibility. We propose layered selective stiffening such\nthat the elements adjacent to the fluid-structure interface - where the bulk of\nthe mesh distortion occurs - are stiffened in consecutive layers. The legacy\nand the new models are able to sustain large deformations without deprecating\nthe mesh quality, and the results are enhanced with using layered selective\nstiffening.",

    "abstract": "Despite the success that metric learning based approaches have achieved in\nfew-shot learning, recent works reveal the ineffectiveness of their episodic\ntraining mode. In this paper, we point out two potential reasons for this\nproblem: 1) the random episodic labels can only provide limited supervision\ninformation, while the relatedness information between the query and support\nsamples is not fully exploited; 2) the meta-learner is usually constrained by\nthe limited contextual information of the local episode. To overcome these\nproblems, we propose a new Global Relatedness Decoupled-Distillation (GRDD)\nmethod using the global category knowledge and the Relatedness\nDecoupled-Distillation (RDD) strategy. Our GRDD learns new visual concepts\nquickly by imitating the habit of humans, i.e. learning from the deep knowledge\ndistilled from the teacher. More specifically, we first train a global learner\non the entire base subset using category labels as supervision to leverage the\nglobal context information of the categories. Then, the well-trained global\nlearner is used to simulate the query-support relatedness in global\ndependencies. Finally, the distilled global query-support relatedness is\nexplicitly used to train the meta-learner using the RDD strategy, with the goal\nof making the meta-learner more discriminative. The RDD strategy aims to\ndecouple the dense query-support relatedness into the groups of sparse\ndecoupled relatedness. Moreover, only the relatedness of a single support\nsample with other query samples is considered in each group. By distilling the\nsparse decoupled relatedness group by group, sharper relatedness can be\neffectively distilled to the meta-learner, thereby facilitating the learning of\na discriminative meta-learner. We conduct extensive experiments on the\nminiImagenet and CIFAR-FS datasets, which show the state-of-the-art performance\nof our GRDD method.",

    "abstract": "Recognizing Activities of Daily Living (ADL) is a vital process for\nintelligent assistive robots, but collecting large annotated datasets requires\ntime-consuming temporal labeling and raises privacy concerns, e.g., if the data\nis collected in a real household. In this work, we explore the concept of\nconstructing training examples for ADL recognition by playing life simulation\nvideo games and introduce the SIMS4ACTION dataset created with the popular\ncommercial game THE SIMS 4. We build Sims4Action by specifically executing\nactions-of-interest in a \"top-down\" manner, while the gaming circumstances\nallow us to freely switch between environments, camera angles and subject\nappearances. While ADL recognition on gaming data is interesting from the\ntheoretical perspective, the key challenge arises from transferring it to the\nreal-world applications, such as smart-homes or assistive robotics. To meet\nthis requirement, Sims4Action is accompanied with a GamingToReal benchmark,\nwhere the models are evaluated on real videos derived from an existing ADL\ndataset. We integrate two modern algorithms for video-based activity\nrecognition in our framework, revealing the value of life simulation video\ngames as an inexpensive and far less intrusive source of training data.\nHowever, our results also indicate that tasks involving a mixture of gaming and\nreal data are challenging, opening a new research direction. We will make our\ndataset publicly available at https://github.com/aroitberg/sims4action.",

    "abstract": "The need to address the scarcity of task-specific annotated data has resulted\nin concerted efforts in recent years for specific settings such as zero-shot\nlearning (ZSL) and domain generalization (DG), to separately address the issues\nof semantic shift and domain shift, respectively. However, real-world\napplications often do not have constrained settings and necessitate handling\nunseen classes in unseen domains -- a setting called Zero-shot Domain\nGeneralization, which presents the issues of domain and semantic shifts\nsimultaneously. In this work, we propose a novel approach that learns\ndomain-agnostic structured latent embeddings by projecting images from\ndifferent domains as well as class-specific semantic text-based representations\nto a common latent space. In particular, our method jointly strives for the\nfollowing objectives: (i) aligning the multimodal cues from visual and\ntext-based semantic concepts; (ii) partitioning the common latent space\naccording to the domain-agnostic class-level semantic concepts; and (iii)\nlearning a domain invariance w.r.t the visual-semantic joint distribution for\ngeneralizing to unseen classes in unseen domains.

While RGB images\nprovide abundant visual cues of certain event, the performance may be affected\nby background clutters. Therefore, we use optical flow to focus on large motion\nand depth maps to infer the scene configuration when the action is related to\nobjects recognizable with their shapes. To integrate the three modalities more\neffectively and enable inter-modal learning, we design a dynamic fusion scheme\nwith transformers to model the interactions between modalities. Furthermore, we\napply intra-modal self-supervised learning to enhance feature representations\nacross videos for each modality, which also facilitates multi-modal learning.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on the Charades-STA and ActivityNet Captions\ndatasets, and show that the proposed method performs favorably against\nstate-of-the-art approaches.",

    "abstract": "We tackle the problem of generalization to unseen configurations for dynamic\ntasks in the real world while learning from high-dimensional image input. The\nfamily of nonlinear dynamical system-based methods have successfully\ndemonstrated dynamic robot behaviors but have difficulty in generalizing to\nunseen configurations as well as learning from image inputs. Recent works\napproach this issue by using deep network policies and reparameterize actions\nto embed the structure of dynamical systems but still struggle in domains with\ndiverse configurations of image goals, and hence, find it difficult to\ngeneralize. In this paper, we address this dichotomy by leveraging embedding\nthe structure of dynamical systems in a hierarchical deep policy learning\nframework, called Hierarchical Neural Dynamical Policies (H-NDPs). Instead of\nfitting deep dynamical systems to diverse data directly, H-NDPs form a\ncurriculum by learning local dynamical system-based policies on small regions\nin state-space and then distill them into a global dynamical system-based\npolicy that operates only from high-dimensional images. H-NDPs additionally\nprovide smooth trajectories, a strong safety benefit in the real world. We\nperform extensive experiments on dynamic tasks both in the real world (digit\nwriting, scooping, and pouring) and simulation (catching, throwing, picking).\nWe show that H-NDPs are easily integrated with both imitation as well as\nreinforcement learning setups and achieve state-of-the-art results.

In PROM, each parameter point can be\nassociated with a subspace, which is used for Petrov-Galerkin projections of\nlarge system matrices. Previous efforts to approximate such functions use\ninterpolations on manifolds, which can be inaccurate and slow. To tackle this,\nwe propose a novel Bayesian nonparametric model for subspace prediction: the\nGaussian Process Subspace regression (GPS) model. This method is extrinsic and\nintrinsic at the same time: with multivariate Gaussian distributions on the\nEuclidean space, it induces a joint probability model on the Grassmann\nmanifold, the set of fixed-dimensional subspaces. The GPS adopts a simple yet\ngeneral correlation structure, and a principled approach for model selection.\nIts predictive distribution admits an analytical form, which allows for\nefficient subspace prediction over the parameter space. For PROM, the GPS\nprovides a probabilistic prediction at a new parameter point that retains the\naccuracy of local reduced models, at a computational complexity that does not\ndepend on system dimension, and thus is suitable for online computation. We\ngive four numerical examples to compare our method to subspace interpolation,\nas well as two methods that interpolate local reduced models.

    "abstract": "This article is an introduction to machine learning for financial\nforecasting, planning and analysis (FP\\&A). Machine learning appears well\nsuited to support FP\\&A with the highly automated extraction of information\nfrom large amounts of data. However, because most traditional machine learning\ntechniques focus on forecasting (prediction), we discuss the particular care\nthat must be taken to avoid the pitfalls of using them for planning and\nresource allocation (causal inference). While the naive application of machine\nlearning usually fails in this context, the recently developed double machine\nlearning framework can address causal questions of interest. We review the\ncurrent literature on machine learning in FP\\&A and illustrate in a simulation\nstudy how machine learning can be used for both forecasting and planning.

This is owing to\ntheir proven ability to surpass state-of-the-art classical image denoising\nalgorithms such as BM3D. Deep denoising CNNs (DnCNNs) use many feedforward\nconvolution layers with added regularization methods of batch normalization and\nresidual learning to improve denoising performance significantly. However, this\ncomes at the expense of a huge number of trainable parameters. In this paper,\nwe address this issue by reducing the number of parameters while achieving a\ncomparable level of performance. We derive motivation from the improved\nperformance obtained by training networks using the dense-sparse-dense (DSD)\ntraining approach. We extend this training approach to a reduced DnCNN (RDnCNN)\nnetwork resulting in a faster denoising network with significantly reduced\nparameters and comparable performance to the DnCNN.",

    "abstract": "Causal discovery from observational data is an important tool in many\nbranches of science. Under certain assumptions it allows scientists to explain\nphenomena, predict, and make decisions. In the large sample limit, sound and\ncomplete causal discovery algorithms have been previously introduced, where a\ndirected acyclic graph (DAG), or its equivalence class, representing causal\nrelations is searched. However, in real-world cases, only finite training data\nis available, which limits the power of statistical tests used by these\nalgorithms, leading to errors in the inferred causal model. This is commonly\naddressed by devising a strategy for using as few as possible statistical\ntests. In this paper, we introduce such a strategy in the form of a recursive\nwrapper for existing constraint-based causal discovery algorithms, which\npreserves soundness and completeness. It recursively clusters the observed\nvariables using the normalized min-cut criterion from the outset, and uses a\nbaseline causal discovery algorithm during backtracking for learning local\nsub-graphs. It then combines them and ensures completeness. By an ablation\nstudy, using synthetic data, and by common real-world benchmarks, we\ndemonstrate that our approach requires significantly fewer statistical tests,\nlearns more accurate graphs, and requires shorter run-times than the baseline\nalgorithm.",

The Generalized Haar-Walsh\nTransform (GHWT) developed by Irion and Saito (2014) is a multiscale transform\nfor signals on graphs, which is a generalization of the classical Haar and\nWalsh-Hadamard Transforms. We propose the extended Generalized Haar-Walsh\nTransform (eGHWT), which is a generalization of the adapted time-frequency\ntilings of Thiele and Villemoes (1996). The eGHWT examines not only the\nefficiency of graph-domain partitions but also that of \"sequency-domain\"\npartitions simultaneously. Consequently, the eGHWT and its associated\nbest-basis selection algorithm for graph signals significantly improve the\nperformance of the previous GHWT with the similar computational cost, $O(N \\log\nN)$, where $N$ is the number of nodes of an input graph. While the GHWT\nbest-basis algorithm seeks the most suitable orthonormal basis for a given task\namong more than $(1.5)^N$ possible orthonormal bases in $\\mathbb{R}^N$, the\neGHWT best-basis algorithm can find a better one by searching through more than\n$0.618\\cdot(1.84)^N$ possible orthonormal bases in $\\mathbb{R}^N$. This article\ndescribes the details of the eGHWT best-basis algorithm and demonstrates its\nsuperiority using several examples including genuine graph signals as well as\nconventional digital images viewed as graph signals. Furthermore, we also show\nhow the eGHWT can be extended to 2D signals and matrix-form data by viewing\nthem as a tensor product of graphs generated from their columns and rows and\ndemonstrate its effectiveness on applications such as image approximation.",

A multiple\npacking is a set $\\mathcal{C}$ of points in $ \\mathbb{R}^n $ such that any\npoint in $ \\mathbb{R}^n $ lies in the intersection of at most $ L-1 $ balls of\nradius $ \\sqrt{nN} $ around points in $ \\mathcal{C} $. We study the multiple\npacking problem for both bounded point sets whose points have norm at most\n$\\sqrt{nP}$ for some constant $P>0$ and unbounded point sets whose points are\nallowed to be anywhere in $ \\mathbb{R}^n $. Given a well-known connection with\ncoding theory, multiple packings can be viewed as the Euclidean analog of\nlist-decodable codes, which are well-studied for finite fields. In this paper,\nwe derive various bounds on the largest possible density of a multiple packing\nin both bounded and unbounded settings. A related notion called average-radius\nmultiple packing is also studied. Some of our lower bounds exactly pin down the\nasymptotics of certain ensembles of average-radius list-decodable codes, e.g.,\n(expurgated) Gaussian codes and (expurgated) Poisson Point Processes. To this\nend, we apply tools from high-dimensional geometry and large deviation theory.\nSome of our lower bounds on the optimal multiple packing density are the best\nknown lower bounds. These bounds are obtained via a proxy known as error\nexponent. The latter quantity is the best exponent of the probability of\nlist-decoding error when the code is corrupted by a Gaussian noise. We\nestablish a curious inequality which relates the error exponent, a quantity of\naverage-case nature, to the list-decoding radius, a quantity of worst-case\nnature. We derive various bounds on the error exponent in both bounded and\nunbounded settings which are of independent interest beyond multiple packing.",

    "abstract": "Despite major advancements in nonlinear programming (NLP) and convex\nrelaxations, most system operators around the world still predominantly use\nsome form of linear programming (LP) approximation of the AC power flow\nequations. This is largely due to LP technology's superior reliability and\ncomputational efficiency, especially in real-time market applications,\nsecurity-constrained applications, and extensions involving integer variables,\nin addition to its ability to readily generate locational marginal prices (LMP)\nfor market applications. In the aim of leveraging the advantages of LP while\nretaining the accuracy of NLP interior-point methods (IPMs), this paper\nproposes a sequential linear programming (SLP) approach consisting of a\nsequence of carefully constructed supporting hyperplanes and halfspaces. The\nalgorithm is numerically demonstrated to converge on 138 test cases with up the\n3375 buses to feasible high-quality solutions (i) without AC feasibility\nrestoration (i.e., using LP solvers exclusively), (ii) in computation times\ngenerally within the same order of magnitude as those from a state-of-the-art\nNLP solver, and (iii) with robustness against the choice of starting point. In\nparticular, the (relative) optimality gaps and the mean constraint violations\nare on average around 1e-3% and 1e-7, respectively, under a single parameter\nsetting for all the 138 test cases. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed\nSLP approach is the first to use LP exclusively to reach feasible and\nhigh-quality solutions to the nonconvex AC OPF in a reliable way, which paves\nthe way for system and market operators to keep using their LP solvers but now\nwith the ability to accurately capture transmission losses, price reactive\npower (Q-LMP), and obtain more accurate LMP.",

    "abstract": "In the massive machine-type communication (mMTC) scenario, a large number of\ndevices with sporadic traffic need to access the network on limited radio\nresources. While grant-free random access has emerged as a promising mechanism\nfor massive access, its potential has not been fully unleashed. In particular,\nthe common sparsity pattern in the received pilot and data signal has been\nignored in most existing studies, and auxiliary information of channel decoding\nhas not been utilized for user activity detection. This paper endeavors to\ndevelop advanced receivers in a holistic manner for joint activity detection,\nchannel estimation, and data decoding. In particular, a turbo receiver based on\nthe bilinear generalized approximate message passing (BiG-AMP) algorithm is\ndeveloped. In this receiver, all the received symbols will be utilized to\njointly estimate the channel state, user activity, and soft data symbols, which\neffectively exploits the common sparsity pattern. Meanwhile, the extrinsic\ninformation from the channel decoder will assist the joint channel estimation\nand data detection. To reduce the complexity, a low-cost side information-aided\nreceiver is also proposed, where the channel decoder provides side information\nto update the estimates on whether a user is active or not. Simulation results\nshow that the turbo receiver is able to reduce the activity detection, channel\nestimation, and data decoding errors effectively, while the side\ninformation-aided receiver notably outperforms the conventional method with a\nrelatively low complexity.",

    "abstract": "With the development of deep encoder-decoder architectures and large-scale\nannotated medical datasets, great progress has been achieved in the development\nof automatic medical image segmentation. Due to the stacking of convolution\nlayers and the consecutive sampling operations, existing standard models\ninevitably encounter the information recession problem of feature\nrepresentations, which fails to fully model the global contextual feature\ndependencies. To overcome the above challenges, this paper proposes a novel\nTransformer based medical image semantic segmentation framework called\nTransAttUnet, in which the multi-level guided attention and multi-scale skip\nconnection are jointly designed to effectively enhance the functionality and\nflexibility of traditional U-shaped architecture. Inspired by Transformer, a\nnovel self-aware attention (SAA) module with both Transformer Self Attention\n(TSA) and Global Spatial Attention (GSA) is incorporated into TransAttUnet to\neffectively learn the non-local interactions between encoder features. In\nparticular, we also establish additional multi-scale skip connections between\ndecoder blocks to aggregate the different semantic-scale upsampling features.\nIn this way, the representation ability of multi-scale context information is\nstrengthened to generate discriminative features. Benefitting from these\ncomplementary components, the proposed TransAttUnet can effectively alleviate\nthe loss of fine details caused by the information recession problem, improving\nthe diagnostic sensitivity and segmentation quality of medical image analysis.\nExtensive experiments on multiple medical image segmentation datasets of\ndifferent imaging demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art baselines.",

With such a unified benchmarking system, we demonstrate that the\nproposed R3L has better generalizability and robustness in image denoising when\nthe estimated noise level varies, comparing to its counterparts using\ndeterministic training, as well as various state-of-the-art image denoising\nalgorithms.",

These expert models are\ngeneralizable and require the calibration of a number of parameters to fit\nexperimental data. However, inherent pitfalls stemming from the restriction to\na specific functional form include poor fits to the data, non-uniqueness of\nfit, and high sensitivity to parameters. In this study we design and train\nfully connected neural networks as material models to replace or augment expert\nmodels. To guarantee objectivity, the neural network takes isochoric strain\ninvariants as inputs, and outputs the value of strain energy and its\nderivatives with respect to the invariants. Convexity of the material model is\nenforced through the loss function. Direct prediction of the derivative\nfunctions -- rather than just predicting the energy -- serves two purposes: it\nprovides flexibility during training, and it enables the calculation of the\nelasticity tensor through back-propagation. We showcase the ability of the\nneural network to learn the mechanical behavior of porcine and murine skin from\nbiaxial test data. Crucially, we show that a multi-fidelity scheme which\ncombines high fidelity experimental data with low fidelity analytical data\nyields the best performance. The neural network material model can then be\ninterpreted as the best extension of an expert model: it learns the features\nthat an expert has encoded in the analytical model while fitting the\nexperimental data better. Finally, we implemented a general user material\nsubroutine (UMAT) for the finite element software Abaqus and thereby make our\nadvances available to the broader computational community.

    "title": "Bayesian brains and the R\u00e9nyi divergence",
    "abstract": "Under the Bayesian brain hypothesis, behavioural variations can be attributed\nto different priors over generative model parameters. This provides a formal\nexplanation for why individuals exhibit inconsistent behavioural preferences\nwhen confronted with similar choices. For example, greedy preferences are a\nconsequence of confident (or precise) beliefs over certain outcomes. Here, we\noffer an alternative account of behavioural variability using R\\'enyi\ndivergences and their associated variational bounds. R\\'enyi bounds are\nanalogous to the variational free energy (or evidence lower bound) and can be\nderived under the same assumptions. Importantly, these bounds provide a formal\nway to establish behavioural differences through an $\\alpha$ parameter, given\nfixed priors. This rests on changes in $\\alpha$ that alter the bound (on a\ncontinuous scale), inducing different posterior estimates and consequent\nvariations in behaviour. Thus, it looks as if individuals have different\npriors, and have reached different conclusions. More specifically, $\\alpha \\to\n0^{+}$ optimisation leads to mass-covering variational estimates and increased\nvariability in choice behaviour. Furthermore, $\\alpha \\to + \\infty$\noptimisation leads to mass-seeking variational posteriors and greedy\npreferences. We exemplify this formulation through simulations of the\nmulti-armed bandit task. We note that these $\\alpha$ parameterisations may be\nespecially relevant, i.e., shape preferences, when the true posterior is not in\nthe same family of distributions as the assumed (simpler) approximate density,\nwhich may be the case in many real-world scenarios. The ensuing departure from\nvanilla variational inference provides a potentially useful explanation for\ndifferences in behavioural preferences of biological (or artificial) agents\nunder the assumption that the brain performs variational Bayesian inference.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning models for medical image segmentation are primarily\ndata-driven. Models trained with more data lead to improved performance and\ngeneralizability. However, training is a computationally expensive process\nbecause multiple hyper-parameters need to be tested to find the optimal setting\nfor best performance. In this work, we focus on accelerating the estimation of\nhyper-parameters by proposing two novel methodologies: proxy data and proxy\nnetworks. Both can be useful for estimating hyper-parameters more efficiently.\nWe test the proposed techniques on CT and MR imaging modalities using\nwell-known public datasets. In both cases using one dataset for building proxy\ndata and another data source for external evaluation. For CT, the approach is\ntested on spleen segmentation with two datasets. The first dataset is from the\nmedical segmentation decathlon (MSD), where the proxy data is constructed, the\nsecondary dataset is utilized as an external validation dataset. Similarly, for\nMR, the approach is evaluated on prostate segmentation where the first dataset\nis from MSD and the second dataset is PROSTATEx. First, we show higher\ncorrelation to using full data for training when testing on the external\nvalidation set using smaller proxy data than a random selection of the proxy\ndata. Second, we show that a high correlation exists for proxy networks when\ncompared with the full network on validation Dice score. Third, we show that\nthe proposed approach of utilizing a proxy network can speed up an AutoML\nframework for hyper-parameter search by 3.3x, and by 4.4x if proxy data and\nproxy network are utilized together.",

    "abstract": "Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is an important tool for studying\nAlzheimer's disease (AD). PET scans can be used as diagnostics tools, and to\nprovide molecular characterization of patients with cognitive disorders.\nHowever, multiple tracers are needed to measure glucose metabolism (18F-FDG),\nsynaptic vesicle protein (11C-UCB-J), and $\\beta$-amyloid (11C-PiB).\nAdministering multiple tracers to patient will lead to high radiation dose and\ncost. In addition, access to PET scans using new or less-available tracers with\nsophisticated production methods and short half-life isotopes may be very\nlimited. Thus, it is desirable to develop an efficient multi-tracer PET\nsynthesis model that can generate multi-tracer PET from single-tracer PET.\nPrevious works on medical image synthesis focus on one-to-one fixed domain\ntranslations, and cannot simultaneously learn the feature from multi-tracer\ndomains. Given 3 or more tracers, relying on previous methods will also create\na heavy burden on the number of models to be trained. To tackle these issues,\nwe propose a 3D unified anatomy-aware cyclic adversarial network (UCAN) for\ntranslating multi-tracer PET volumes with one unified generative model, where\nMR with anatomical information is incorporated. Evaluations on a multi-tracer\nPET dataset demonstrate the feasibility that our UCAN can generate high-quality\nmulti-tracer PET volumes, with NMSE less than 15% for all PET tracers.",

These models\naim to learn binding mechanics through drug-target interaction datasets and use\nthe learned knowledge while predicting the affinity of any protein-compound\npair. However, the datasets they rely on bear misleading patterns that bias\nmodels towards memorizing dataset-specific biomolecule properties, instead of\nlearning binding mechanics. Insufficiently focused on the binding mechanics,\nthe resulting models struggle while predicting the drug-target affinities\n(DTA), especially between de novo biomolecules. Here we present DebiasedDTA,\nthe first model debiasing approach that avoids dataset biases in order to boost\nthe affinity prediction on novel biomolecules. DebiasedDTA uses ensemble\nlearning and weight sample adaptation for bias identification and avoidance and\nis applicable to almost all existing DTA prediction models. Results: The\nresults show that DebiasedDTA can boost models while predicting the\ninteractions between novel biomolecules. Known biomolecules also benefit from\nthe performance boost, though the boost is amplified as the test biomolecules\nbecome more dissimilar to the training set. The experiments also show that\nDebiasedDTA can augment the DTA prediction models of different input and model\nstructures and can avoid biases of different sources.
