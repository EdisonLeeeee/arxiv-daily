    "abstract": "Automatic sentiment analysis play vital role in decision making. Many\norganizations spend a lot of budget to understand their customer satisfaction\nby manually going over their feedback/comments or tweets. Automatic sentiment\nanalysis can give overall picture of the comments received against any event,\nproduct, or activity. Usually, the comments/tweets are classified into two main\nclasses that are negative or positive. However, the negative comments are too\nabstract to understand the basic reason or the context. organizations are\ninterested to identify the exact reason for the negativity. In this research\nstudy, we hierarchically goes down into negative comments, and link them with\nmore classes. Tweets are extracted from social media sites such as Twitter and\nFacebook. If the sentiment analysis classifies any tweet into negative class,\nthen we further try to associates that negative comments with more possible\nnegative classes. Based on expert opinions, the negative comments/tweets are\nfurther classified into 8 classes. Different machine learning algorithms are\nevaluated and their accuracy are reported.",

    "abstract": "Transformers have achieved success in both language and vision domains.\nHowever, it is prohibitively expensive to scale them to long sequences such as\nlong documents or high-resolution images, because self-attention mechanism has\nquadratic time and memory complexities with respect to the input sequence\nlength. In this paper, we propose Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an\nefficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear\ncomplexity for both language and vision tasks. It aggregates a novel long-range\nattention with dynamic projection to model distant correlations and a\nshort-term attention to capture fine-grained local correlations. We propose a\ndual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two\nattention mechanisms. Transformer-LS can be applied to both autoregressive and\nbidirectional models without additional complexity. Our method outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art models on multiple tasks in language and vision domains,\nincluding the Long Range Arena benchmark, autoregressive language modeling, and\nImageNet classification. For instance, Transformer-LS achieves 0.97 test BPC on\nenwik8 using half the number of parameters than previous method, while being\nfaster and is able to handle 3$\\times$ as long sequences compared to its\nfull-attention version on the same hardware. On ImageNet, it can obtain the\nstate-of-the-art results~(e.g., Top-1 accuracy 84.1% trained on 224$\\times$224\nImageNet-1K only), while being more scalable on high-resolution images.

    "abstract": "The complexity of software tasks and the uncertainty of crowd developer\nbehaviors make it challenging to plan crowdsourced software development (CSD)\nprojects. In a competitive crowdsourcing marketplace, competition for shared\nworker resources from multiple simultaneously open tasks adds another layer of\nuncertainty to the potential outcomes of software crowdsourcing. These factors\nlead to the need for supporting CSD managers with automated scheduling to\nimprove the visibility and predictability of crowdsourcing processes and\noutcomes. To that end, this paper proposes an evolutionary algorithm-based task\nscheduling method for crowdsourced software development. The proposed\nevolutionary scheduling method uses a multiobjective genetic algorithm to\nrecommend an optimal task start date. The method uses three fitness functions,\nbased on project duration, task similarity, and task failure prediction,\nrespectively. The task failure fitness function uses a neural network to\npredict the probability of task failure with respect to a specific task start\ndate. The proposed method then recommends the best tasks start dates for the\nproject as a whole and each individual task so as to achieve the lowest project\nfailure ratio. Experimental results on 4 projects demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod has the potential to reduce project duration by a factor of 33-78%.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, deep learning is widely applied to extract features for similarity\ncomputation in person re-identification (re-ID) and have achieved great\nsuccess. However, due to the non-overlapping between training and testing IDs,\nthe difference between the data used for model training and the testing data\nmakes the performance of learned feature degraded during testing. Hence,\nre-ranking is proposed to mitigate this issue and various algorithms have been\ndeveloped. However, most of existing re-ranking methods focus on replacing the\nEuclidean distance with sophisticated distance metrics, which are not friendly\nto downstream tasks and hard to be used for fast retrieval of massive data in\nreal applications. In this work, we propose a graph-based re-ranking method to\nimprove learned features while still keeping Euclidean distance as the\nsimilarity metric. Inspired by graph convolution networks, we develop an\noperator to propagate features over an appropriate graph. Since graph is the\nessential key for the propagation, two important criteria are considered for\ndesigning the graph, and three different graphs are explored accordingly.\nFurthermore, a simple yet effective method is proposed to generate a profile\nvector for each tracklet in videos, which helps extend our method to video\nre-ID. Extensive experiments on three benchmark data sets, e.g., Market-1501,\nDuke, and MARS, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.",

    "abstract": "Context: Software crowdsourcing platforms typically employ extrinsic rewards\nsuch as rating or ranking systems to motivate workers. Such rating systems are\nnoisy and only provide limited knowledge about worker's preferences and\nperformance. Goal: The objective of this study is to empirically investigate\npatterns and effects of worker behavior in software crowdsourcing platforms in\norder to improve the success and efficiency of software crowdsourcing. Method:\nFirst, we create the bipartite network of active workers based on common\nregistration for tasks. Then, we use the Clauset-Newman-Moore graph clustering\nalgorithm to identify developer clusters in the network. Finally, we conduct an\nempirical evaluation to measure and analyze workers' behavior per identified\ncluster in the platform by workers' ranking. More specifically, workers'\nbehavior is analyzed based on worker reliability, worker trustworthiness, and\nworker success as measures for workers' performance, worker efficiency, and\nworker elasticity to represent workers' preferences, and worker contest, worker\nconfidence, and worker deceitfulness to understand workers' strategies. The\nempirical study is conducted on more than one year's real-world data from\ntopcoder, one of the leading software crowdsourcing platforms. Results: We\nidentify four clusters of active workers: mixed-ranked, high-ranked,\nmid-ranked, and low-ranked. Based on statistical analysis, this study can only\nsupport that the low ranked group associates with the highest reliable workers\nwith an average reliability of 25%, while the mixed-ranked group contains the\nmost trustworthy workers with average trustworthiness of 16%. Conclusions:\nThese findings are helpful for task requesters to understand preferences and\nrelations among unknown resources in the platform and plan for task success in\na more effective and efficient manner in a software crowdsourcing platform.",

    "abstract": "A recurring theme in statistical learning, online learning, and beyond is\nthat faster convergence rates are possible for problems with low noise, often\nquantified by the performance of the best hypothesis; such results are known as\nfirst-order or small-loss guarantees. While first-order guarantees are\nrelatively well understood in statistical and online learning, adapting to low\nnoise in contextual bandits (and more broadly, decision making) presents major\nalgorithmic challenges. In a COLT 2017 open problem, Agarwal, Krishnamurthy,\nLangford, Luo, and Schapire asked whether first-order guarantees are even\npossible for contextual bandits and -- if so -- whether they can be attained by\nefficient algorithms. We give a resolution to this question by providing an\noptimal and efficient reduction from contextual bandits to online regression\nwith the logarithmic (or, cross-entropy) loss.

In a large-scale empirical\nevaluation, we find that our approach typically outperforms comparable\nnon-first-order methods.\nOn the technical side, we show that the logarithmic loss and an\ninformation-theoretic quantity called the triangular discrimination play a\nfundamental role in obtaining first-order guarantees, and we combine this\nobservation with new refinements to the regression oracle reduction framework\nof Foster and Rakhlin.

    "abstract": "We take a geometrical viewpoint and present a unifying view on supervised\ndeep learning with the Bregman divergence loss function - this entails frequent\nclassification and prediction tasks. Motivated by simulations we suggest that\nthere is principally no implicit bias of vanilla stochastic gradient descent\ntraining of deep models towards \"simpler\" functions. Instead, we show that good\ngeneralization may be instigated by bounded spectral products over layers\nleading to a novel geometric regularizer. It is revealed that in deep enough\nmodels such a regularizer enables both, extreme accuracy and generalization, to\nbe reached. We associate popular regularization techniques like weight decay,\ndrop out, batch normalization, and early stopping with this perspective. Backed\nup by theory we further demonstrate that \"generalization by design\" is\npractically possible and that good generalization may be encoded into the\nstructure of the network. We design two such easy-to-use structural\nregularizers that insert an additional \\textit{generalization layer} into a\nmodel architecture, one with a skip connection and another one with drop-out.\nWe verify our theoretical results in experiments on various feedforward and\nconvolutional architectures, including ResNets, and datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10,\nsynthetic data). We believe this work opens up new avenues of research towards\nbetter generalizing architectures.",

Due to their diversity in radio resource use and channel\naccess techniques, when collocated, these wireless devices create interference\nwith each other, known as Cross-Technology Interference (CTI), which can lead\nto increased packet losses and energy consumption. CTI is a significant problem\nfor low-power wireless networks, such as IEEE 802.15.4, as it decreases the\noverall dependability of the wireless network.\nTo improve the performance of low-power wireless networks under CTI\nconditions, we propose a data-driven proactive receiver-aware MAC protocol,\nLUCID, based on interference estimation and white space prediction. We leverage\nstatistical analysis of real-world traces from two indoor environments\ncharacterised by varying channel conditions to develop CTI prediction methods.\nThe CTI models that generate accurate predictions of interference behaviour are\nan intrinsic part of our solution.

    "abstract": "We introduce the problem of sleeping dueling bandits with stochastic\npreferences and adversarial availabilities (DB-SPAA). In almost all dueling\nbandit applications, the decision space often changes over time; eg, retail\nstore management, online shopping, restaurant recommendation, search engine\noptimization, etc. Surprisingly, this `sleeping aspect' of dueling bandits has\nnever been studied in the literature. Like dueling bandits, the goal is to\ncompete with the best arm by sequentially querying the preference feedback of\nitem pairs. The non-triviality however results due to the non-stationary item\nspaces that allow any arbitrary subsets items to go unavailable every round.\nThe goal is to find an optimal `no-regret' policy that can identify the best\navailable item at each round, as opposed to the standard `fixed best-arm regret\nobjective' of dueling bandits. We first derive an instance-specific lower bound\nfor DB-SPAA $\\Omega( \\sum_{i =1}^{K-1}\\sum_{j=i+1}^K \\frac{\\log\nT}{\\Delta(i,j)})$, where $K$ is the number of items and $\\Delta(i,j)$ is the\ngap between items $i$ and $j$. This indicates that the sleeping problem with\npreference feedback is inherently more difficult than that for classical\nmulti-armed bandits (MAB). We then propose two algorithms, with near optimal\nregret guarantees. Our results are corroborated empirically.",

An under-specified\nor poorly-designed DL model may train successfully but is likely to perform\npoorly when deployed in production. Design smells in DL programs are poor\ndesign and-or configuration decisions taken during the development of DL\ncomponents, that are likely to have a negative impact on the performance (i.e.,\nprediction accuracy) and then quality of DL based software systems. In this\npaper, we present a catalogue of 8 design smells for a popular DL architecture,\nnamely deep Feedforward Neural Networks which is widely employed in industrial\napplications. The design smells were identified through a review of the\nexisting literature on DL design and a manual inspection of 659 DL programs\nwith performance issues and design inefficiencies. The smells are specified by\ndescribing their context, consequences, and recommended refactorings. To\nprovide empirical evidence on the relevance and perceived impact of the\nproposed design smells, we conducted a survey with 81 DL developers.

In this work, we consider\nmultigrid-reduction-in-time (MGRIT), a multilevel method applied to the time\ndimension that computes multiple time-steps in parallel. Like all multigrid\nmethods, MGRIT relies on the complementary relationship between relaxation on a\nfine-grid and a correction from the coarse grid to solve the problem. All\ncurrent MGRIT implementations are based on unweighted-Jacobi relaxation; here\nwe introduce the concept of weighted relaxation to MGRIT. We derive new\nconvergence bounds for weighted relaxation, and use this analysis to guide the\nselection of relaxation weights. Numerical results then demonstrate that\nnon-unitary relaxation weights consistently yield faster convergence rates and\nlower iteration counts for MGRIT when compared with unweighted relaxation. In\nmost cases, weighted relaxation yields a 10%-20% saving in iterations. For\nA-stable integration schemes, results also illustrate that under-relaxation can\nrestore convergence in some cases where unweighted relaxation is not\nconvergent.",

    "abstract": "Dialog acts can be interpreted as the atomic units of a conversation, more\nfine-grained than utterances, characterized by a specific communicative\nfunction. The ability to structure a conversational transcript as a sequence of\ndialog acts -- dialog act recognition, including the segmentation -- is\ncritical for understanding dialog. We apply two pre-trained transformer models,\nXLNet and Longformer, to this task in English and achieve strong results on\nSwitchboard Dialog Act and Meeting Recorder Dialog Act corpora with dialog act\nsegmentation error rates (DSER) of 8.4% and 14.2%. To understand the key\nfactors affecting dialog act recognition, we perform a comparative analysis of\nmodels trained under different conditions. We find that the inclusion of a\nbroader conversational context helps disambiguate many dialog act classes,\nespecially those infrequent in the training data. The presence of punctuation\nin the transcripts has a massive effect on the models' performance, and a\ndetailed analysis reveals specific segmentation patterns observed in its\nabsence. Finally, we find that the label set specificity does not affect dialog\nact segmentation performance. These findings have significant practical\nimplications for spoken language understanding applications that depend heavily\non a good-quality segmentation being available.",

    "title": "Connectivity Matters: Neural Network Pruning Through the Lens of  Effective Sparsity",
    "abstract": "Neural network pruning is a fruitful area of research with surging interest\nin high sparsity regimes. Benchmarking in this domain heavily relies on\nfaithful representation of the sparsity of subnetworks, which has been\ntraditionally computed as the fraction of removed connections (direct\nsparsity). This definition, however, fails to recognize unpruned parameters\nthat detached from input or output layers of underlying subnetworks,\npotentially underestimating actual effective sparsity: the fraction of\ninactivated connections. While this effect might be negligible for moderately\npruned networks (up to 10-100 compression rates), we find that it plays an\nincreasing role for thinner subnetworks, greatly distorting comparison between\ndifferent pruning algorithms. For example, we show that effective compression\nof a randomly pruned LeNet-300-100 can be orders of magnitude larger than its\ndirect counterpart, while no discrepancy is ever observed when using SynFlow\nfor pruning [Tanaka et al., 2020]. In this work, we adopt the lens of effective\nsparsity to reevaluate several recent pruning algorithms on common benchmark\narchitectures (e.g., LeNet-300-100, VGG-19, ResNet-18) and discover that their\nabsolute and relative performance changes dramatically in this new and more\nappropriate framework. To aim for effective, rather than direct, sparsity, we\ndevelop a low-cost extension to most pruning algorithms. Further, equipped with\neffective sparsity as a reference frame, we partially reconfirm that random\npruning with appropriate sparsity allocation across layers performs as well or\nbetter than more sophisticated algorithms for pruning at initialization [Su et\nal., 2020]. In response to this observation, using a simple analogy of pressure\ndistribution in coupled cylinders from physics, we design novel layerwise\nsparsity quotas that outperform all existing baselines in the context of random\npruning.",

    "abstract": "In keyhole interventions, surgeons rely on a colleague to act as a camera\nassistant when their hands are occupied with surgical instruments. This often\nleads to reduced image stability, increased task completion times and sometimes\nerrors. Robotic endoscope holders (REHs), controlled by a set of basic\ninstructions, have been proposed as an alternative, but their unnatural\nhandling increases the cognitive load of the surgeon, hindering their\nwidespread clinical acceptance. We propose that REHs collaborate with the\noperating surgeon via semantically rich instructions that closely resemble\nthose issued to a human camera assistant, such as \"focus on my right-hand\ninstrument\". As a proof-of-concept, we present a novel system that paves the\nway towards a synergistic interaction between surgeons and REHs.

    "title": "Effect of uncertainty visualizations on myopic loss aversion and equity  premium puzzle in retirement investment decisions",
    "abstract": "For many households, investing for retirement is one of the most significant\ndecisions and is fraught with uncertainty. In a classic study in behavioral\neconomics, Benartzi and Thaler (1999) found evidence using bar charts that\ninvestors exhibit myopic loss aversion in retirement decisions: Investors\noverly focus on the potential for short-term losses, leading them to invest\nless in riskier assets and miss out on higher long-term returns. Recently,\nadvances in uncertainty visualizations have shown improvements in\ndecision-making under uncertainty in a variety of tasks. In this paper, we\nconduct a controlled and incentivized crowdsourced experiment replicating\nBenartzi and Thaler (1999) and extending it to measure the effect of different\nuncertainty representations on myopic loss aversion. Consistent with the\noriginal study, we find evidence of myopic loss aversion with bar charts and\nfind that participants make better investment decisions with longer evaluation\nperiods. We also find that common uncertainty representations such as interval\nplots and bar charts achieve the highest mean expected returns while other\nuncertainty visualizations lead to poorer long-term performance and strong\neffects on the equity premium. Qualitative feedback further suggests that\ndifferent uncertainty representations lead to visual reasoning heuristics that\ncan either mitigate or encourage a focus on potential short-term losses. We\ndiscuss implications of our results on using uncertainty visualizations for\nretirement decisions in practice and possible extensions for future work.",

The main contributions of our work are: we capture the execution\norder of program statements as an abstract domain, and propose a sound upper\napproximation over this domain to efficiently reason over RA concurrency. The\nproposed domain is general in its application and captures the ordering\nrelations as a first-class feature in the abstract interpretation theory. In\nparticular, the domain represents a set of sequences of modifications of a\nglobal variable in concurrent programs as a partially ordered set. Under this\napproximation, older sequenced-before stores of a global variable are forgotten\nand only the latest stores per variable are preserved. We establish the\nsoundness of our proposed abstractions and implement them in a prototype\nabstract interpreter called PRIORI. The evaluations of PRIORI on existing and\nchallenging RA benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed technique is not only\ncompetitive in refutation, but also in verification. PRIORI shows significantly\nfast analysis runtimes with higher precision compared to recent\nstate-of-the-art tools for RA concurrency.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of training robust and accurate deep neural networks\n(DNNs) when subject to various proportions of noisy labels. Large-scale\ndatasets tend to contain mislabeled samples that can be memorized by DNNs,\nimpeding the performance. With appropriate handling, this degradation can be\nalleviated. There are two problems to consider: how to distinguish clean\nsamples and how to deal with noisy samples. In this paper, we present Ensemble\nNoise-robust K-fold Cross-Validation Selection (E-NKCVS) to effectively select\nclean samples from noisy data, solving the first problem. For the second\nproblem, we create a new pseudo label for any sample determined to have an\nuncertain or likely corrupt label. E-NKCVS obtains multiple predicted labels\nfor each sample and the entropy of these labels is used to tune the weight\ngiven to the pseudo label and the given label. Theoretical analysis and\nextensive verification of the algorithms in the noisy label setting are\nprovided. We evaluate our approach on various image and text classification\ntasks where the labels have been manually corrupted with different noise\nratios. Additionally, two large real-world noisy datasets are also used,\nClothing-1M and WebVision. E-NKCVS is empirically shown to be highly tolerant\nto considerable proportions of label noise and has a consistent improvement\nover state-of-the-art methods. Especially on more difficult datasets with\nhigher noise ratios, we can achieve a significant improvement over the\nsecond-best model.

    "abstract": "When a robot performs a task next to a human, physical interaction is\ninevitable: the human might push, pull, twist, or guide the robot. The\nstate-of-the-art treats these interactions as disturbances that the robot\nshould reject or avoid. At best, these robots respond safely while the human\ninteracts; but after the human lets go, these robots simply return to their\noriginal behavior. We recognize that physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) is\noften intentional -- the human intervenes on purpose because the robot is not\ndoing the task correctly. In this paper, we argue that when pHRI is intentional\nit is also informative: the robot can leverage interactions to learn how it\nshould complete the rest of its current task even after the person lets go. We\nformalize pHRI as a dynamical system, where the human has in mind an objective\nfunction they want the robot to optimize, but the robot does not get direct\naccess to the parameters of this objective -- they are internal to the human.\nWithin our proposed framework human interactions become observations about the\ntrue objective. We introduce approximations to learn from and respond to pHRI\nin real-time. We recognize that not all human corrections are perfect: often\nusers interact with the robot noisily, and so we improve the efficiency of\nrobot learning from pHRI by reducing unintended learning. Finally, we conduct\nsimulations and user studies on a robotic manipulator to compare our proposed\napproach to the state-of-the-art. Our results indicate that learning from pHRI\nleads to better task performance and improved human satisfaction.",

In this article, we develop a methodology to transform a subset of Coq\ngoals into first-order statements that can be automatically discharged by\nautomatic provers. The general idea is to write modular, pairwise independent\ntransformations and combine them. Each of these eliminates a specific aspect of\nCoq logic towards first-order logic. As a proof of concept, we apply this\nmethodology to a set of simple but crucial transformations which extend the\nlocal context with proven first-order assertions that make Coq definitions and\nalgebraic types explicit. They allow users of Coq to solve non-trivial goals\nautomatically. This methodology paves the way towards the definition and\ncombination of more complex transformations, making Coq more accessible.",

    "abstract": "With the widespread use of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), machine learning\nalgorithms have evolved in two diverse directions -- one with ever-increasing\nconnection density for better accuracy and the other with more compact sizing\nfor energy efficiency. The increase in connection density increases on-chip\ndata movement, which makes efficient on-chip communication a critical function\nof the DNN accelerator. The contribution of this work is threefold. First, we\nillustrate that the point-to-point (P2P)-based interconnect is incapable of\nhandling a high volume of on-chip data movement for DNNs. Second, we evaluate\nP2P and network-on-chip (NoC) interconnect (with a regular topology such as a\nmesh) for SRAM- and ReRAM-based in-memory computing (IMC) architectures for a\nrange of DNNs. This analysis shows the necessity for the optimal interconnect\nchoice for an IMC DNN accelerator. Finally, we perform an experimental\nevaluation for different DNNs to empirically obtain the performance of the IMC\narchitecture with both NoC-tree and NoC-mesh. We conclude that, at the tile\nlevel, NoC-tree is appropriate for compact DNNs employed at the edge, and\nNoC-mesh is necessary to accelerate DNNs with high connection density.\nFurthermore, we propose a technique to determine the optimal choice of\ninterconnect for any given DNN. In this technique, we use analytical models of\nNoC to evaluate end-to-end communication latency of any given DNN. We\ndemonstrate that the interconnect optimization in the IMC architecture results\nin up to 6$\\times$ improvement in energy-delay-area product for VGG-19\ninference compared to the state-of-the-art ReRAM-based IMC architectures.",

To guarantee both constraint feasibility and\nreal-time trajectory re-plannability, we present an integrated framework for\nreal-time optimization-based trajectory planning of a hydraulic excavator. The\nproposed framework is composed of two main modules: a global planner and a\nreal-time local planner. The global planner computes the entire global\ntrajectory considering excavation volume and energy minimization while the\nlocal counterpart tracks the global trajectory in a receding horizon manner,\nsatisfying dynamic feasibility, physical constraints, and\ndisturbance-awareness. We validate the proposed planning algorithm in a\nsimulation environment where two types of operations are conducted in the\npresence of emulated disturbance from hydraulic friction and soil-bucket\ninteraction: shallow and deep excavation. The optimized global trajectories are\nobtained in an order of a second, which is tracked by the local planner at\nfaster than 30 Hz. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first\nreal-time motion planning framework that satisfies constraints of a hydraulic\nexcavator, such as force/torque, power, cylinder displacement, and flow rate\nlimits.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has advanced from fully connected architectures to structured\nmodels organized into components, e.g., the transformer composed of positional\nelements, modular architectures divided into slots, and graph neural nets made\nup of nodes. In structured models, an interesting question is how to conduct\ndynamic and possibly sparse communication among the separate components. Here,\nwe explore the hypothesis that restricting the transmitted information among\ncomponents to discrete representations is a beneficial bottleneck. The\nmotivating intuition is human language in which communication occurs through\ndiscrete symbols. Even though individuals have different understandings of what\na ``\"cat\" is based on their specific experiences, the shared discrete token\nmakes it possible for communication among individuals to be unimpeded by\nindividual differences in internal representation. To discretize the values of\nconcepts dynamically communicated among specialist components, we extend the\nquantization mechanism from the Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder to\nmulti-headed discretization with shared codebooks and use it for\ndiscrete-valued neural communication (DVNC). Our experiments show that DVNC\nsubstantially improves systematic generalization in a variety of architectures\n-- transformers, modular architectures, and graph neural networks. We also show\nthat the DVNC is robust to the choice of hyperparameters, making the method\nvery useful in practice. Moreover, we establish a theoretical justification of\nour discretization process, proving that it has the ability to increase noise\nrobustness and reduce the underlying dimensionality of the model.",

This result generalizes both non-stationary linear\nbandits and standard GP-UCB algorithms. Further, a novel concentration\ninequality is achieved for weighted Gaussian process regression with general\nweights.

    "abstract": "Federated learning is an emerging research paradigm for enabling\ncollaboratively training deep learning models without sharing patient data.\nHowever, the data from different institutions are usually heterogeneous across\ninstitutions, which may reduce the performance of models trained using\nfederated learning. In this study, we propose a novel heterogeneity-aware\nfederated learning method, SplitAVG, to overcome the performance drops from\ndata heterogeneity in federated learning. Unlike previous federated methods\nthat require complex heuristic training or hyper parameter tuning, our SplitAVG\nleverages the simple network split and feature map concatenation strategies to\nencourage the federated model training an unbiased estimator of the target data\ndistribution. We compare SplitAVG with seven state-of-the-art federated\nlearning methods, using centrally hosted training data as the baseline on a\nsuite of both synthetic and real-world federated datasets. We find that the\nperformance of models trained using all the comparison federated learning\nmethods degraded significantly with the increasing degrees of data\nheterogeneity. In contrast, SplitAVG method achieves comparable results to the\nbaseline method under all heterogeneous settings, that it achieves 96.2% of the\naccuracy and 110.4% of the mean absolute error obtained by the baseline in a\ndiabetic retinopathy binary classification dataset and a bone age prediction\ndataset, respectively, on highly heterogeneous data partitions.

Contrary to conventional machine learning aiming to learn inherent\nprediction rules to predict labels for new query data, meta learning aims to\nlearn the learning methodology for machine learning from observed tasks, so as\nto generalize to new query tasks by leveraging the meta-learned learning\nmethodology. In this study, we interpret such learning methodology as learning\nan explicit hyperparameter prediction policy shared by all training tasks.\nSpecifically, this policy is represented as a parameterized function called\nmeta-learner, mapping from a training/test task to its suitable hyperparameter\nsetting, extracted from a pre-specified function set called meta learning\nmachine. Such setting guarantees that the meta-learned learning methodology is\nable to flexibly fit diverse query tasks, instead of only obtaining fixed\nhyperparameters by many current meta learning methods, with less adaptability\nto query task's variations. Such understanding of meta learning also makes it\neasily succeed from traditional learning theory for analyzing its\ngeneralization bounds with general losses/tasks/models. The theory naturally\nleads to some feasible controlling strategies for ameliorating the quality of\nthe extracted meta-learner, verified to be able to finely ameliorate its\ngeneralization capability in some typical meta learning applications, including\nfew-shot regression, few-shot classification and domain generalization.",

    "abstract": "Person re-identification (re-ID) under various occlusions has been a\nlong-standing challenge as person images with different types of occlusions\noften suffer from misalignment in image matching and ranking. Most existing\nmethods tackle this challenge by aligning spatial features of body parts\naccording to external semantic cues or feature similarities but this alignment\napproach is complicated and sensitive to noises. We design DRL-Net, a\ndisentangled representation learning network that handles occluded re-ID\nwithout requiring strict person image alignment or any additional supervision.\nLeveraging transformer architectures, DRL-Net achieves alignment-free re-ID via\nglobal reasoning of local features of occluded person images. It measures image\nsimilarity by automatically disentangling the representation of undefined\nsemantic components, e.g., human body parts or obstacles, under the guidance of\nsemantic preference object queries in the transformer. In addition, we design a\ndecorrelation constraint in the transformer decoder and impose it over object\nqueries for better focus on different semantic components. To better eliminate\ninterference from occlusions, we design a contrast feature learning technique\n(CFL) for better separation of occlusion features and discriminative ID\nfeatures. Extensive experiments over occluded and holistic re-ID benchmarks\n(Occluded-DukeMTMC, Market1501 and DukeMTMC) show that the DRL-Net achieves\nsuperior re-ID performance consistently and outperforms the state-of-the-art by\nlarge margins for Occluded-DukeMTMC.",

    "abstract": "Visually-aware recommendation on E-commerce platforms aims to leverage visual\ninformation of items to predict a user's preference. It is commonly observed\nthat user's attention to visual features does not always reflect the real\npreference. Although a user may click and view an item in light of a visual\nsatisfaction of their expectations, a real purchase does not always occur due\nto the unsatisfaction of other essential features (e.g., brand, material,\nprice). We refer to the reason for such a visually related interaction\ndeviating from the real preference as a visual bias. Existing visually-aware\nmodels make use of the visual features as a separate collaborative signal\nsimilarly to other features to directly predict the user's preference without\nconsidering a potential bias, which gives rise to a visually biased\nrecommendation. In this paper, we derive a causal graph to identify and analyze\nthe visual bias of these existing methods. In this causal graph, the visual\nfeature of an item acts as a mediator, which could introduce a spurious\nrelationship between the user and the item. To eliminate this spurious\nrelationship that misleads the prediction of the user's real preference, an\nintervention and a counterfactual inference are developed over the mediator.\nParticularly, the Total Indirect Effect is applied for a debiased prediction\nduring the testing phase of the model. This causal inference framework is model\nagnostic such that it can be integrated into the existing methods. Furthermore,\nwe propose a debiased visually-aware recommender system, denoted as CausalRec\nto effectively retain the supportive significance of the visual information and\nremove the visual bias. Extensive experiments are conducted on eight benchmark\ndatasets, which shows the state-of-the-art performance of CausalRec and the\nefficacy of debiasing.",

Cross entropy (CE) loss, which is widely\nused for image recognition, is learned so that the probability value of true\nclass is closer to one by back propagation. However, for imbalanced datasets,\nthe learning is insufficient for the classes with a small number of samples.\nTherefore, we propose a novel classification method using the MSE loss that can\nbe learned the relationships of all classes no matter which image is input.\nUnlike CE loss, MSE loss is possible to equalize the number of back propagation\nfor all classes and to learn the feature space considering the relationships\nbetween classes as metric learning. Furthermore, instead of the usual one-hot\nteacher label, we use a novel teacher label that takes the number of class\nsamples into account. This induces the outlying label which depends on the\nnumber of samples in each class, and the class with a small number of samples\nhas outlying margin in a feature space. It is possible to create the feature\nspace for separating high-difficulty classes and low-difficulty classes.

    "abstract": "Developers often encounter unfamiliar code during software maintenance which\nconsumes a significant amount of time for comprehension, especially for novice\nprogrammers. Automated techniques that analyze a source code and present key\ninformation to the developers can lead to an effective comprehension of the\ncode. Researchers have come up with automated code summarization techniques\nthat focus on code summarization by generating brief summaries rather than\naiding its comprehension. Existing debuggers represent the execution states of\nthe program but they do not show the complete execution at a single point.\nStudies have revealed that the effort required for program comprehension can be\nreduced if novice programmers are provided with worked examples. Hence, we\npropose COSPEX (Comprehension using Summarization via Program Execution) - an\nAtom plugin that dynamically extracts key information for every line of code\nexecuted and presents it to the developers in the form of an interactive\nexample-like dynamic information instance. As a preliminary evaluation, we\npresented 14 undergraduates having Python programming experience up to 1 year\nwith a code comprehension task in a user survey. We observed that COSPEX helped\nnovice programmers in program comprehension and improved their understanding of\nthe code execution.

Specifically, ONSR consists of two\nbranches, namely internal branch (IB) and external branch (EB). IB could learn\nthe specific degradation of the given test LR image, and EB could learn to\nsuper resolve images degraded by the learned degradation. In this way, ONSR\ncould customize a specific model for each test image, and thus could be more\ntolerant with various degradations in real applications.

Continual learning is a growing field of research that examines\nhow AI systems can learn sequentially from a continuous stream of linked data\nin the same way that biological systems do. Simultaneously, fake media such as\ndeepfakes and synthetic face images have emerged as significant to current\nmultimedia technologies. Recently, numerous method has been proposed which can\ndetect deepfakes with high accuracy. However, they suffer significantly due to\ntheir reliance on fixed datasets in limited evaluation settings.

In this work, we propose an assisted\ndriving system leveraging the synergy between connected vehicles and the edge\nof the network infrastructure, in order to envision global traffic policies\nthat can effectively drive local decisions. Local decisions concern individual\nvehicles, e.g., which vehicle should perform a lane-change manoeuvre and when;\nglobal decisions, instead, involve whole traffic flows. Such decisions are made\nat different time scales by different entities, which are integrated within an\nedge-based architecture and can share information. In particular, we leverage a\nqueuing-based model and formulate an optimization problem to make global\ndecisions on traffic flows. To cope with the problem complexity, we then\ndevelop an iterative, linear-time complexity algorithm called Bottleneck\nHunting (BH). We show the performance of our solution using a realistic\nsimulation framework, integrating a Python engine with ns-3 and SUMO, and\nconsidering two relevant services, namely, lane change assistance and\nnavigation, in a real-world scenario.

In the\npre-training stage, we utilize the contrastive learning approach to learn the\nconsistent textual representations for the captions corresponding to the same\nimage. Furthermore, in the following stage of GAN training, we employ the\ncontrastive learning method to enhance the consistency between the generated\nimages from the captions related to the same image. We evaluate our approach\nover two popular text-to-image synthesis models, AttnGAN and DM-GAN, on\ndatasets CUB and COCO, respectively. Experimental results have shown that our\napproach can effectively improve the quality of synthetic images in terms of\nthree metrics: IS, FID and R-precision. Especially, on the challenging COCO\ndataset, our approach boosts the FID significantly by 29.60% over AttnGAn and\nby 21.96% over DM-GAN.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning is vulnerable to adversarial examples. Many defenses based on\nrandomized neural networks have been proposed to solve the problem, but fail to\nachieve robustness against attacks using proxy gradients such as the\nExpectation over Transformation (EOT) attack. We investigate the effect of the\nadversarial attacks using proxy gradients on randomized neural networks and\ndemonstrate that it highly relies on the directional distribution of the loss\ngradients of the randomized neural network. We show in particular that proxy\ngradients are less effective when the gradients are more scattered. To this\nend, we propose Gradient Diversity (GradDiv) regularizations that minimize the\nconcentration of the gradients to build a robust randomized neural network. Our\nexperiments on MNIST, CIFAR10, and STL10 show that our proposed GradDiv\nregularizations improve the adversarial robustness of randomized neural\nnetworks against a variety of state-of-the-art attack methods.

As applications struggle to make use of increasingly heterogeneous\ncompute nodes, maintaining high efficiency (performance per watt) for the whole\nplatform becomes a challenge. Alongside the growing complexity of scientific\nworkloads, this extreme heterogeneity is also an opportunity: as applications\ndynamically undergo variations in workload, due to phases or data/compute\nmovement between devices, one can dynamically adjust power across compute\nelements to save energy without impacting performance. With an aim toward an\nautonomous and dynamic power management strategy for current and future HPC\narchitectures, this paper explores the use of control theory for the design of\na dynamic power regulation method. Structured as a feedback loop, our\napproach-which is novel in computing resource management-consists of\nperiodically monitoring application progress and choosing at runtime a suitable\npower cap for processors. Thanks to a preliminary offline identification\nprocess, we derive a model of the dynamics of the system and a\nproportional-integral (PI) controller.

    "abstract": "In order to tackle the difficulty associated with the ill-posed nature of the\nimage registration problem, researchers use regularization to constrain the\nsolution space. For most learning-based registration approaches, the\nregularization usually has a fixed weight and only constrains the spatial\ntransformation. Such convention has two limitations: (1) The regularization\nstrength of a specific image pair should be associated with the content of the\nimages, thus the ``one value fits all'' scheme is not ideal; (2) Only spatially\nregularizing the transformation (but overlooking the temporal consistency of\ndifferent estimations) may not be the best strategy to cope with the\nill-posedness. In this study, we propose a mean-teacher based registration\nframework. This framework incorporates an additional \\textit{temporal\nregularization} term by encouraging the teacher model's temporal ensemble\nprediction to be consistent with that of the student model. At each training\nstep, it also automatically adjusts the weights of the \\textit{spatial\nregularization} and the \\textit{temporal regularization} by taking account of\nthe transformation uncertainty and appearance uncertainty derived from the\nperturbed teacher model. We perform experiments on multi- and uni-modal\nregistration tasks, and the results show that our strategy outperforms the\ntraditional and learning-based benchmark methods.",

    "abstract": "Image editing techniques enable people to modify the content of an image\nwithout leaving visual traces and thus may cause serious security risks. Hence\nthe detection and localization of these forgeries become quite necessary and\nchallenging. Furthermore, unlike other tasks with extensive data, there is\nusually a lack of annotated forged images for training due to annotation\ndifficulties. In this paper, we propose a self-adversarial training strategy\nand a reliable coarse-to-fine network that utilizes a self-attention mechanism\nto localize forged regions in forgery images. The self-attention module is\nbased on a Channel-Wise High Pass Filter block (CW-HPF). CW-HPF leverages\ninter-channel relationships of features and extracts noise features by high\npass filters. Based on the CW-HPF, a self-attention mechanism, called forgery\nattention, is proposed to capture rich contextual dependencies of intrinsic\ninconsistency extracted from tampered regions. Specifically, we append two\ntypes of attention modules on top of CW-HPF respectively to model internal\ninterdependencies in spatial dimension and external dependencies among\nchannels. We exploit a coarse-to-fine network to enhance the noise\ninconsistency between original and tampered regions. More importantly, to\naddress the issue of insufficient training data, we design a self-adversarial\ntraining strategy that expands training data dynamically to achieve more robust\nperformance. Specifically, in each training iteration, we perform adversarial\nattacks against our network to generate adversarial examples and train our\nmodel on them.

SU-MMIMO has a much\nhigher spectral efficiency compared to multi-user massive MIMO (MU-MMIMO) since\nindependent signals are transmitted from each of the antenna elements (spatial\nmultiplexing). MU-MMIMO that uses beamforming has a much lower spectral\nefficiency, since the same signal (with a delay) is transmitted from each of\nthe antenna elements. In this work, expressions for the upper bound on the\naverage signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per bit and spectral efficiency are derived\nfor SU-MMIMO with and without precoding. We propose a performance index\n$f(N_t)$, which is a function of the number of transmit antennas $N_t$. Here\n$f(N_t)$ is the sum of the upper bound on the average SNR per bit and the\nspectral efficiency. We demonstrate that when the total number of antennas\n($N_{\\mathrm{tot}}$) in the transmitter and receiver is fixed, there exists a\nminimum value of $f(N_t)$, which has to be avoided. Computer simulations show\nthat the bit-error-rate (BER) is nearly insensitive to a wide range of the\nnumber of transmit antennas and re-transmissions, when $N_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ is\nlarge and kept constant. Thus, the spectral efficiency can be made as large as\npossible, for a given BER and $N_{\\mathrm{tot}}$.",

But this concept of utility is not\nsingular - rather it can take a range of forms. In this paper, we present a\nnovel approach to deduce two key types of utility for VPR: the utility of\nvisual cues `specific' to an environment, and to a particular place. We employ\ncontrastive learning principles to estimate both the environment- and\nplace-specific utility of Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD)\nclusters in an unsupervised manner, which is then used to guide local feature\nmatching through keypoint selection. By combining these two utility measures,\nour approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on three challenging\nbenchmark datasets, while simultaneously reducing the required storage and\ncompute time. We provide further analysis demonstrating that unsupervised\ncluster selection results in semantically meaningful results, that finer\ngrained categorization often has higher utility for VPR than high level\nsemantic categorization (e.g. building, road), and characterise how these two\nutility measures vary across different places and environments.

    "abstract": "Motor disturbances can affect the interaction with dynamic objects, such as\ncatching a ball. A classification of clinical catching trials might give\ninsight into the existence of pathological alterations in the relation of arm\nand ball movements. Accurate, but also early decisions are required to classify\na catching attempt before the catcher's first ball contact. To obtain\nclinically valuable results, a significant decision confidence of at least 75%\nis required. Hence, three competing objectives have to be optimized at the same\ntime: accuracy, earliness and decision-making confidence. Here we propose a\ncoupled classification and prediction approach for early time series\nclassification: a predictive, generative recurrent neural network (RNN)\nforecasts the next data points of ball trajectories based on already available\nobservations; a discriminative RNN continuously generates classification\nguesses based on the available data points and the unrolled sequence\npredictions. We compare our approach, which we refer to as predictive\nsequential classification (PSC), to state-of-the-art sequence learners,\nincluding various RNN and temporal convolutional network (TCN) architectures.\nOn this hard real-world task we can consistently demonstrate the superiority of\nPSC over all other models in terms of accuracy and confidence with respect to\nearliness of recognition. Specifically, PSC is able to confidently classify the\nsuccess of catching trials as early as 123 milliseconds before the first ball\ncontact.

Having multiple parallel\nconvolutional/dense operations in each layer solves this problem, but without\nany context-dependent allocation of resources among these operations: the\nparallel computations tend to learn similar features making the widening\nprocess less effective.

To do this, we first introduce a cross-prediction based\nalgorithm between parallel tensors of subsequent layers.

    "title": "Neural Mixture Models with Expectation-Maximization for End-to-end Deep  Clustering",
    "abstract": "Any clustering algorithm must synchronously learn to model the clusters and\nallocate data to those clusters in the absence of labels. Mixture model-based\nmethods model clusters with pre-defined statistical distributions and allocate\ndata to those clusters based on the cluster likelihoods. They iteratively\nrefine those distribution parameters and member assignments following the\nExpectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. However, the cluster representability\nof such hand-designed distributions that employ a limited amount of parameters\nis not adequate for most real-world clustering tasks. In this paper, we realize\nmixture model-based clustering with a neural network where the final layer\nneurons, with the aid of an additional transformation, approximate cluster\ndistribution outputs. The network parameters pose as the parameters of those\ndistributions. The result is an elegant, much-generalized representation of\nclusters than a restricted mixture of hand-designed distributions. We train the\nnetwork end-to-end via batch-wise EM iterations where the forward pass acts as\nthe E-step and the backward pass acts as the M-step. In image clustering, the\nmixture-based EM objective can be used as the clustering objective along with\nexisting representation learning methods. In particular, we show that when\nmixture-EM optimization is fused with consistency optimization, it improves the\nsole consistency optimization performance in clustering. Our trained networks\noutperform single-stage deep clustering methods that still depend on k-means,\nwith unsupervised classification accuracy of 63.8% in STL10, 58% in CIFAR10,\n25.9% in CIFAR100, and 98.9% in MNIST.",

Next, we design FloorLevel-Net, a multi-task\nlearning network that associates explicit features of building facades and\nimplicit floor-level lines, along with a height-attention mechanism to help\nenforce a vertical ordering of floor-level lines. The generated segmentations\nare then passed to a second-stage geometry post-processing to exploit\nself-constrained geometric priors for plausible and consistent reconstruction\nof floor-level lines.

    "title": "Metric-Distortion Bounds under Limited Information",
    "abstract": "In this work we study the metric distortion problem in voting theory under a\nlimited amount of ordinal information. Our primary contribution is threefold.\nFirst, we consider mechanisms which perform a sequence of pairwise comparisons\nbetween candidates. We show that a widely-popular deterministic mechanism\nemployed in most knockout phases yields distortion $\\mathcal{O}(\\log m)$ while\neliciting only $m-1$ out of $\\Theta(m^2)$ possible pairwise comparisons, where\n$m$ represents the number of candidates. Our analysis for this mechanism\nleverages a powerful technical lemma recently developed by Kempe\n\\cite{DBLP:conf/aaai/000120a}. We also provide a matching lower bound on its\ndistortion. In contrast, we prove that any mechanism which performs fewer than\n$m-1$ pairwise comparisons is destined to have unbounded distortion. Moreover,\nwe study the power of deterministic mechanisms under incomplete rankings. Most\nnotably, when every agent provides her $k$-top preferences we show an upper\nbound of $6 m/k + 1$ on the distortion, for any $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, m\\}$.\nThus, we substantially improve over the previous bound of $12 m/k$ recently\nestablished by Kempe \\cite{DBLP:conf/aaai/000120a,DBLP:conf/aaai/000120b}, and\nwe come closer to matching the best-known lower bound. Finally, we are\nconcerned with the sample complexity required to ensure near-optimal distortion\nwith high probability. Our main contribution is to show that a random sample of\n$\\Theta(m/\\epsilon^2)$ voters suffices to guarantee distortion $3 + \\epsilon$\nwith high probability, for any sufficiently small $\\epsilon > 0$. This result\nis based on analyzing the sensitivity of the deterministic mechanism introduced\nby Gkatzelis, Halpern, and Shah \\cite{DBLP:conf/focs/Gkatzelis0020}.\nImportantly, all of our sample-complexity bounds are distribution-independent.",

    "abstract": "As cameras are increasingly deployed in new application domains such as\nautonomous driving, performing 3D object detection on monocular images becomes\nan important task for visual scene understanding. Recent advances on monocular\n3D object detection mainly rely on the ``pseudo-LiDAR'' generation, which\nperforms monocular depth estimation and lifts the 2D pixels to pseudo 3D\npoints. However, depth estimation from monocular images, due to its poor\naccuracy, leads to inevitable position shift of pseudo-LiDAR points within the\nobject. Therefore, the predicted bounding boxes may suffer from inaccurate\nlocation and deformed shape. In this paper, we present a novel neighbor-voting\nmethod that incorporates neighbor predictions to ameliorate object detection\nfrom severely deformed pseudo-LiDAR point clouds. Specifically, each feature\npoint around the object forms their own predictions, and then the ``consensus''\nis achieved through voting. In this way, we can effectively combine the\nneighbors' predictions with local prediction and achieve more accurate 3D\ndetection. To further enlarge the difference between the foreground region of\ninterest (ROI) pseudo-LiDAR points and the background points, we also encode\nthe ROI prediction scores of 2D foreground pixels into the corresponding\npseudo-LiDAR points. We conduct extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark to\nvalidate the merits of our proposed method. Our results on the bird's eye view\ndetection outperform the state-of-the-art performance by a large margin,\nespecially for the ``hard'' level detection.",

    "abstract": "The main challenges of image-to-image (I2I) translation are to make the\ntranslated image realistic and retain as much information from the source\ndomain as possible. To address this issue, we propose a novel architecture,\ntermed as IEGAN, which removes the encoder of each network and introduces an\nencoder that is independent of other networks. Compared with previous models,\nit embodies three advantages of our model: Firstly, it is more directly and\ncomprehensively to grasp image information since the encoder no longer receives\nloss from generator and discriminator. Secondly, the independent encoder allows\neach network to focus more on its own goal which makes the translated image\nmore realistic. Thirdly, the reduction in the number of encoders performs more\nunified image representation. However, when the independent encoder applies two\ndown-sampling blocks, it's hard to extract semantic information. To tackle this\nproblem, we propose deep and shallow information space containing\ncharacteristic and semantic information, which can guide the model to translate\nhigh-quality images under the task with significant shape or texture change. We\ncompare IEGAN with other previous models, and conduct researches on semantic\ninformation consistency and component ablation at the same time. These\nexperiments show the superiority and effectiveness of our architecture. Our\ncode is published on: https://github.com/Elvinky/IEGAN.",

    "abstract": "Network utilisation efficiency can, at least in principle, often be improved\nby dynamically re-configuring routing policies to better distribute on-going\nlarge data transfers. Unfortunately, the information necessary to decide on an\nappropriate reconfiguration - details of on-going and upcoming data transfers\nsuch as their source and destination and, most importantly, their volume and\nduration - is usually lacking. Fortunately, the increased use of scheduled\ntransfer services, such as FTS, makes it possible to collect the necessary\ninformation. However, the mere detection and characterisation of larger\ntransfers is not sufficient to predict with confidence the likelihood a network\nlink will become overloaded.

Multimodal\noptimization is the problem of finding all local optimal solutions (modes) to a\npath optimization problem. This is important to compress path databases, as\ncontingencies for replanning and as source of symbolic representations.\nFollowing ideas from Morse theory, we define modes as paths invariant under\noptimization of a cost functional. We develop a multi-mode estimation algorithm\nwhich approximately finds all modes of a given motion optimization problem and\nasymptotically converges. This is made possible by integrating sparse roadmaps\nwith an existing single-mode optimization algorithm.

    "abstract": "Ki67 is a significant biomarker in the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer,\nwhose index can be evaluated by quantifying its expression in Ki67\nimmunohistochemistry (IHC) stained images. However, quantitative analysis on\nmulti-source Ki67 images is yet a challenging task in practice due to\ncross-domain distribution differences, which result from imaging variation,\nstaining styles, and lesion types. Many recent studies have made some efforts\non domain generalization (DG), whereas there are still some noteworthy\nlimitations. Specifically in the case of Ki67 images, learning invariant\nrepresentation is at the mercy of the insufficient number of domains and the\ncell categories mismatching in different domains. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel method to improve DG by searching the domain-agnostic subnetwork in a\ndomain merging scenario. Partial model parameters are iteratively pruned\naccording to the domain gap, which is caused by the data converting from a\nsingle domain into merged domains during training. In addition, the model is\noptimized by fine-tuning on merged domains to eliminate the interference of\nclass mismatching among various domains. Furthermore, an appropriate\nimplementation is attained by applying the pruning method to different parts of\nthe framework. Compared with known DG methods, our method yields excellent\nperformance in multiclass nucleus recognition of Ki67 IHC images, especially in\nthe lost category cases. Moreover, our competitive results are also evaluated\non the public dataset over the state-of-the-art DG methods.",

    "abstract": "For early breast cancer detection, regular screening with mammography imaging\nis recommended. Routinary examinations result in datasets with a predominant\namount of negative samples. A potential solution to such class-imbalance is\njoining forces across multiple institutions. Developing a collaborative\ncomputer-aided diagnosis system is challenging in different ways. Patient\nprivacy and regulations need to be carefully respected. Data across\ninstitutions may be acquired from different devices or imaging protocols,\nleading to heterogeneous non-IID data. Also, for learning-based methods, new\noptimization strategies working on distributed data are required. Recently,\nfederated learning has emerged as an effective tool for collaborative learning.\nIn this setting, local models perform computation on their private data to\nupdate the global model. The order and the frequency of local updates influence\nthe final global model. Hence, the order in which samples are locally presented\nto the optimizers plays an important role. In this work, we define a\nmemory-aware curriculum learning method for the federated setting. Our\ncurriculum controls the order of the training samples paying special attention\nto those that are forgotten after the deployment of the global model. Our\napproach is combined with unsupervised domain adaptation to deal with domain\nshift while preserving data privacy. We evaluate our method with three clinical\ndatasets from different vendors.

We\nintroduce HyperATL*, an extension of computation tree logic with path variables\nand strategy quantifiers. HyperATL* can express strategic hyperproperties, such\nas that the scheduler in a concurrent system has a strategy to avoid\ninformation leakage. HyperATL* is particularly useful to specify asynchronous\nhyperproperties, i.e., hyperproperties where the speed of the execution on the\ndifferent computation paths depends on the choices of the scheduler. Unlike\nother recent logics for the specification of asynchronous hyperproperties, our\nlogic is the first to admit decidable model checking for the full logic. We\npresent a model checking algorithm for HyperATL* based on alternating word\nautomata and show that our algorithm is asymptotically optimal by providing a\nmatching lower bound.

    "abstract": "Tabular generative adversarial networks (TGAN) have recently emerged to cater\nto the need of synthesizing tabular data -- the most widely used data format.\nWhile synthetic tabular data offers the advantage of complying with privacy\nregulations, there still exists a risk of privacy leakage via inference attacks\ndue to interpolating the properties of real data during training. Differential\nprivate (DP) training algorithms provide theoretical guarantees for training\nmachine learning models by injecting statistical noise to prevent privacy\nleaks. However, the challenges of applying DP on TGAN are to determine the most\noptimal framework (i.e., PATE/DP-SGD) and neural network (i.e.,\nGenerator/Discriminator)to inject noise such that the data utility is well\nmaintained under a given privacy guarantee. In this paper, we propose DTGAN, a\nnovel conditional Wasserstein tabular GAN that comes in two variants DTGAN_G\nand DTGAN_D, for providing a detailed comparison of tabular GANs trained using\nDP-SGD for the generator vs discriminator, respectively. We elicit the privacy\nanalysis associated with training the generator with complex loss functions\n(i.e., classification and information losses) needed for high quality tabular\ndata synthesis. Additionally, we rigorously evaluate the theoretical privacy\nguarantees offered by DP empirically against membership and attribute inference\nattacks. Our results on 3 datasets show that the DP-SGD framework is superior\nto PATE and that a DP discriminator is more optimal for training convergence.\nThus, we find (i) DTGAN_D is capable of maintaining the highest data utility\nacross 4 ML models by up to 18% in terms of the average precision score for a\nstrict privacy budget, epsilon = 1, as compared to the prior studies and (ii)\nDP effectively prevents privacy loss against inference attacks by restricting\nthe success probability of membership attacks to be close to 50%.",

    "abstract": "Homography estimation is an important task in computer vision, such as image\nstitching, video stabilization, and camera calibration. Traditional homography\nestimation methods heavily depend on the quantity and distribution of feature\npoints, leading to poor robustness in textureless scenes.

In this paper, we\naddress the two problems simultaneously, by designing a contextual correlation\nlayer, which can capture the long-range correlation on feature maps and\nflexibly be bridged in a learning framework. In addition, considering that a\nsingle homography can not represent the complex spatial transformation in\ndepth-varying images with parallax, we propose to predict multi-grid homography\nfrom global to local.

In this paper, we develop AdaSpeech 3, an adaptive TTS system that\nfine-tunes a well-trained reading-style TTS model for spontaneous-style speech.\nSpecifically, 1) to insert filled pauses (FP) in the text sequence\nappropriately, we introduce an FP predictor to the TTS model; 2) to model the\nvarying rhythms, we introduce a duration predictor based on mixture of experts\n(MoE), which contains three experts responsible for the generation of fast,\nmedium and slow speech respectively, and fine-tune it as well as the pitch\npredictor for rhythm adaptation; 3) to adapt to other speaker timbre, we\nfine-tune some parameters in the decoder with few speech data.

    "abstract": "Processing massive application graphs on distributed memory systems requires\nto map the graphs onto the system's processing elements (PEs). This task\nbecomes all the more important when PEs have non-uniform communication costs or\nthe input is highly irregular. Typically, mapping is addressed using\npartitioning, in a two-step approach or an integrated one. Parallel\npartitioning tools do exist; yet, corresponding mapping algorithms or their\npublic implementations all have major sequential parts or other severe scaling\nlimitations. In this paper, we propose a parallel algorithm that maps graphs\nonto the PEs of a hierarchical system. Our solution integrates partitioning and\nmapping; it models the system hierarchy in a concise way as an implicit labeled\ntree. The vertices of the application graph are labeled as well, and these\nvertex labels induce the mapping. The mapping optimization follows the basic\nidea of parallel label propagation, but we tailor the gain computations of\nlabel changes to quickly account for the induced communication costs. Our\nMPI-based code is the first public implementation of a parallel graph mapping\nalgorithm; to this end, we extend the partitioning library ParHIP. To evaluate\nour algorithm's implementation, we perform comparative experiments with complex\nnetworks in the million- and billion-scale range. In general our mapping tool\nshows good scalability on up to a few thousand PEs.

    "abstract": "Deformable convolution networks (DCNs) proposed to address the image\nrecognition with geometric or photometric variations typically involve\ndeformable convolution that convolves on arbitrary locations of input features.\nThe locations change with different inputs and induce considerable dynamic and\nirregular memory accesses which cannot be handled by classic neural network\naccelerators (NNAs). Moreover, bilinear interpolation (BLI) operation that is\nrequired to obtain deformed features in DCNs also cannot be deployed on\nexisting NNAs directly. Although a general purposed processor (GPP) seated\nalong with classic NNAs can process the deformable convolution, the processing\non GPP can be extremely slow due to the lack of parallel computing capability.\nTo address the problem, we develop a DCN accelerator on existing NNAs to\nsupport both the standard convolution and deformable convolution. Specifically,\nfor the dynamic and irregular accesses in DCNs, we have both the input and\noutput features divided into tiles and build a tile dependency table (TDT) to\ntrack the irregular tile dependency at runtime. With the TDT, we further\ndevelop an on-chip tile scheduler to handle the dynamic and irregular accesses\nefficiently. In addition, we propose a novel mapping strategy to enable\nparallel BLI processing on NNAs and apply layer fusion techniques for more\nenergy-efficient DCN processing. According to our experiments, the proposed\naccelerator achieves orders of magnitude higher performance and energy\nefficiency compared to the typical computing architectures including ARM,\nARM+TPU, and GPU with 6.6\\% chip area penalty to a classic NNA.",

We show that the weighted\nvariant, parameterized by the number of vertices $n$, is significantly harder\nthan the unweighted problem by presenting an $O(n^{3 - \\varepsilon})$ lower\nbound on the size of the kernel, under the assumption that NP $\\not \\subseteq$\ncoNP/poly. This lower bound is essentially tight: we show that we can reduce\nthe problem to the case with weights bounded by $2^{O(n)}$, which yields a\nrandomized kernel of $O(n^3)$ bits.\nWe generalize these results to the weighted $d$-Uniform Hyperclique problem,\nSubset Sum, and weighted variants of Boolean Constraint Satisfaction Problems\n(CSPs).

The use of cameras for localization with\nhigh definition map (HD Map) provides an affordable localization sensor set.\nExisting methods suffer from pose estimation failure due to error prone data\nassociation or initialization with accurate initial pose requirement. In this\npaper, we propose a cost-effective vehicle localization system with HD map for\nautonomous driving that uses cameras as primary sensors. To this end, we\nformulate vision-based localization as a data association problem that maps\nvisual semantics to landmarks in HD map. Specifically, system initialization is\nfinished in a coarse to fine manner by combining coarse GPS (Global Positioning\nSystem) measurement and fine pose searching. In tracking stage, vehicle pose is\nrefined by implicitly aligning the semantic segmentation result between image\nand landmarks in HD maps with photometric consistency. Finally, vehicle pose is\ncomputed by pose graph optimization in a sliding window fashion. We evaluate\nour method on two datasets and demonstrate that the proposed approach yields\npromising localization results in different driving scenarios. Additionally,\nour approach is suitable for both monocular camera and multi-cameras that\nprovides flexibility and improves robustness for the localization system.",

The proposed SED model consists of two stages: a\nmean-teacher model for providing target labels regarding weakly labeled or\nunlabeled data and a self-training-based noisy student model for predicting\nstrong labels for sound events. The mean-teacher model, which is based on the\nresidual convolutional recurrent neural network (RCRNN) for the teacher and\nstudent model, is first trained using all the training data from a weakly\nlabeled dataset, an unlabeled dataset, and a strongly labeled synthetic\ndataset. Then, the trained mean-teacher model predicts the strong label to each\nof the weakly labeled and unlabeled datasets, which is brought to the noisy\nstudent model in the second stage of the proposed SED model. Here, the\nstructure of the noisy student model is identical to the RCRNN-based student\nmodel of the mean-teacher model in the first stage. Then, it is self-trained by\nadding feature noises, such as time-frequency shift, mixup, SpecAugment, and\ndropout-based model noise. In addition, a semi-supervised loss function is\napplied to train the noisy student model, which acts as label noise injection.\nThe performance of the proposed SED model is evaluated on the validation set of\nthe DCASE 2021 Challenge Task 4, and then, several ensemble models that combine\nfive-fold validation models with different hyperparameters of the\nsemi-supervised loss function are finally selected as our final models.",

An $r$-way separator divides a planar graph with\n$N$ vertices into $O(r)$ regions of size $O(N/r)$ and $O(\\sqrt {Nr})$ boundary\nvertices in total, where boundary vertices are vertices that are adjacent to\nmore than one region. Such separators are used in I/O-efficient solutions to\nmany fundamental problems on planar graphs such as breadth-first search,\nfinding single-source shortest paths, topological sorting, and finding strongly\nconnected components. Our main result is an I/O-efficient sampling-based\nalgorithm that, given a Koebe-embedding of a graph with $N$ vertices and a\nparameter $r$, computes an $r$-way separator for the graph under certain\nassumptions on the size of internal memory. Computing a Koebe-embedding of a\nplanar graph is difficult in practice and no known I/O-efficient algorithm\ncurrently exists. Therefore, we show how our algorithm can be generalized and\napplied directly to Delaunay triangulations without relying on a\nKoebe-embedding. This adaptation can produce many boundary vertices in the\nworst-case, however, to our knowledge our result is the first to be implemented\nin practice due to the many non-trivial and complex techniques used in previous\nresults. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm performs well on real-world\ndata and that the number of boundary vertices is small in practice.\nMotivated by applications in geometric information systems, we show how our\nalgorithm for Delaunay triangulations can be applied to compute the flow\naccumulation over a terrain, which models how much water flows over the\nvertices of a terrain. When given an $r$-way separator, our implementation of\nthe algorithm outperforms traditional sweep-line-based algorithms on the\npublicly available digital elevation model of Denmark.",

A traditional approach is to contrast different\nmodalities to learn the information shared between them.

Another approach is to concatenate all the\nmodalities into a tuple and then contrast positive and negative tuple\ncorrespondences. However, that approach could consider only the stronger\nmodalities while ignoring the weaker ones. To address these issues, we propose\na novel contrastive learning objective, TupleInfoNCE. It contrasts tuples based\nnot only on positive and negative correspondences but also by composing new\nnegative tuples using modalities describing different scenes. Training with\nthese additional negatives encourages the learning model to examine the\ncorrespondences among modalities in the same tuple, ensuring that weak\nmodalities are not ignored. We provide a theoretical justification based on\nmutual information for why this approach works, and we propose a sample\noptimization algorithm to generate positive and negative samples to maximize\ntraining efficacy.

In this paper,\nwe propose ROPNet, a new deep learning model using Representative Overlapping\nPoints with discriminative features for registration that transforms\npartial-to-partial registration into partial-to-complete registration.\nSpecifically, we propose a context-guided module which uses an encoder to\nextract global features for predicting point overlap score. To better find\nrepresentative overlapping points, we use the extracted global features for\ncoarse alignment. Then, we introduce a Transformer to enrich point features and\nremove non-representative points based on point overlap score and feature\nmatching. A similarity matrix is built in a partial-to-complete mode, and\nfinally, weighted SVD is adopted to estimate a transformation matrix. Extensive\nexperiments over ModelNet40 using noisy and partially overlapping point clouds\nshow that the proposed method outperforms traditional and learning-based\nmethods, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Whilst OCS was initially invented by\nFahrbach, Huang, Tao, and Zadimoghaddam to solve the edge-weighted online\nbipartite matching problem, it is an interesting technique on its own due to\nits capability of introducing a powerful algorithmic tool, namely negative\ncorrelation, to online algorithms. As such, Fahrbach et al. posed two\ntantalizing open questions in their paper, one of which was the following: Can\nwe obtain n-way OCS for n>2, in which the algorithm can be given n>2 elements\nto choose from at each timestep?\nIn this paper, we affirmatively answer this open question by presenting a\nthree-way OCS. Our algorithm uses two-way OCS as its building block and is\nsimple to describe; however, as it internally runs two instances of two-way\nOCS, one of which is fed with the output of the other, the final output\nprobability distribution becomes highly elusive. We tackle this difficulty by\napproximating the output distribution of OCS by a flat, less correlated\nfunction and using it as a safe \"surrogate\" of the real distribution.

Recently proposed HS\npansharpening methods have obtained remarkable results using deep convolutional\nnetworks (ConvNets), which typically consist of three steps: (1) up-sampling\nthe LR-HSI, (2) predicting the residual image via a ConvNet, and (3) obtaining\nthe final fused HSI by adding the outputs from first and second steps. Recent\nmethods have leveraged Deep Image Prior (DIP) to up-sample the LR-HSI due to\nits excellent ability to preserve both spatial and spectral information,\nwithout learning from large data sets. However, we observed that the quality of\nup-sampled HSIs can be further improved by introducing an additional\nspatial-domain constraint to the conventional spectral-domain energy function.\nWe define our spatial-domain constraint as the $L_1$ distance between the\npredicted PAN image and the actual PAN image. To estimate the PAN image of the\nup-sampled HSI, we also propose a learnable spectral response function (SRF).\nMoreover, we noticed that the residual image between the up-sampled HSI and the\nreference HSI mainly consists of edge information and very fine structures. In\norder to accurately estimate fine information, we propose a novel over-complete\nnetwork, called HyperKite, which focuses on learning high-level features by\nconstraining the receptive from increasing in the deep layers. We perform\nexperiments on three HSI datasets to demonstrate the superiority of our\nDIP-HyperKite over the state-of-the-art pansharpening methods. The deployment\ncodes, pre-trained models, and final fusion outputs of our DIP-HyperKite and\nthe methods used for the comparisons will be publicly made available at\nhttps://github.com/wgcban/DIP-HyperKite.git.",

    "abstract": "Graph representation learning has attracted a surge of interest recently,\nwhose target at learning discriminant embedding for each node in the graph.\nMost of these representation methods focus on supervised learning and heavily\ndepend on label information. However, annotating graphs are expensive to obtain\nin the real world, especially in specialized domains (i.e. biology), as it\nneeds the annotator to have the domain knowledge to label the graph. To\napproach this problem, self-supervised learning provides a feasible solution\nfor graph representation learning. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Level\nGraph Contrastive Learning (MLGCL) framework for learning robust representation\nof graph data by contrasting space views of graphs. Specifically, we introduce\na novel contrastive view - topological and feature space views. The original\ngraph is first-order approximation structure and contains uncertainty or error,\nwhile the $k$NN graph generated by encoding features preserves high-order\nproximity. Thus $k$NN graph generated by encoding features not only provide a\ncomplementary view, but is more suitable to GNN encoder to extract discriminant\nrepresentation. Furthermore, we develop a multi-level contrastive mode to\npreserve the local similarity and semantic similarity of graph-structured data\nsimultaneously.

This equivalence allows us to view the Louvain\nalgorithm as a nearest-neighbor search that approximately minimizes the\ndistance to this modularity vector. By replacing this modularity vector by a\ndifferent vector, many alternative community detection methods can be obtained.\nWe explore this wider class and compare it to existing modularity-based\nmethods.

In this work, we propose a new CNN architecture that is pose\nand scale invariant thanks to the use of Spatial Transformer Network (STN). Our\narchitecture is composed of three sequential modules that are estimated\ntogether during training: (i) a regression module to estimate a similarity\nmatrix to normalize the input image to a reference one; (ii) a differentiable\nmodule to find the region of interest to segment; (iii) a segmentation module,\nbased on the popular UNet architecture, to delineate the object. Unlike the\noriginal UNet, which strives to learn a complex mapping, including pose and\nscale variations, from a finite training dataset, our segmentation module\nlearns a simpler mapping focusing on images with normalized pose and size.\nFurthermore, the use of an automatic bounding box detection through STN allows\nsaving time and especially memory, while keeping similar performance. We test\nthe proposed method in kidney and renal tumor segmentation on abdominal\npediatric CT scanners. Results indicate that the estimated STN homogenization\nof size and pose accelerates the segmentation (25h), compared to standard\ndata-augmentation (33h), while obtaining a similar quality for the kidney\n(88.01\\% of Dice score) and improving the renal tumor delineation (from 85.52\\%\nto 87.12\\%).",

    "title": "VidLanKD: Improving Language Understanding via Video-Distilled Knowledge  Transfer",
    "abstract": "Since visual perception can give rich information beyond text descriptions\nfor world understanding, there has been increasing interest in leveraging\nvisual grounding for language learning. Recently, vokenization has attracted\nattention by using the predictions of a text-to-image retrieval model as labels\nfor language model supervision. Despite its success, the method suffers from\napproximation error of using finite image labels and the lack of vocabulary\ndiversity of a small image-text dataset. To overcome these limitations, we\npresent VidLanKD, a video-language knowledge distillation method for improving\nlanguage understanding. We train a multi-modal teacher model on a video-text\ndataset, and then transfer its knowledge to a student language model with a\ntext dataset. To avoid approximation error, we propose to use different\nknowledge distillation objectives. In addition, the use of a large-scale\nvideo-text dataset helps learn diverse and richer vocabularies. In our\nexperiments, VidLanKD achieves consistent improvements over text-only language\nmodels and vokenization models, on several downstream language understanding\ntasks including GLUE, SQuAD, and SWAG. We also demonstrate the improved world\nknowledge, physical reasoning, and temporal reasoning capabilities of our model\nby evaluating on the GLUE-diagnostics, PIQA, and TRACIE datasets. Lastly, we\npresent comprehensive ablation studies as well as visualizations of the learned\ntext-to-video grounding results of our teacher and student language models.

In the former case, models of software, which\nmay specify the software system architecture on different levels of abstraction\ncould be used in various stages of the Software Development Life-Cycle (SDLC),\nfrom early conceptualization and design, to verification, implementation,\ntesting and evolution. However, in the latter case, i.e., AI, models may\nprovide smart capabilities, such as prediction and decision making support. For\ninstance, in Machine Learning (ML), which is the most popular sub-discipline of\nAI at the present time, mathematical models may learn useful patterns in the\nobserved data instances and can become capable of making better predictions or\nrecommendations in the future. The goal of this work is to create synergy by\nbringing models in the said communities together and proposing a holistic\napproach. We illustrate how software models can become capable of producing or\ndealing with data analytics and ML models. The main focus is on the Internet of\nThings (IoT) and smart Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) use cases, where both ML\nand model-driven (model-based) SE play a key role.

Our model-to-code transformations (code generators) provide the\nfull source code of the desired IoT services out of the model instances in an\nautomated manner.

In addition to the pure MDSE approach, where certain ML methods,\ne.g., K-Means, Mini-Batch K-Means, DB-SCAN, Spectral Clustering, Gaussian\nMixture Model, Self-Training, Label Propagation and Label Spreading are\nsupported, a more flexible, hybrid approach is also enabled to support the\npractitioner in deploying a pre-trained ML model with any arbitrary\narchitecture and learning algorithm.",

The method is based on the\ninvariantization of standard, non-invariant discrete Lagrangian functionals\nusing equivariant moving frames. The invariant variational schemes are given by\nthe Euler-Lagrange equations of the corresponding invariantized discrete\nLagrangian functionals. We showcase this general method by constructing\ninvariant variational schemes of ordinary differential equations that preserve\nvariational and divergence symmetries of the associated continuous Lagrangians.\nNoether's theorem automatically implies that the resulting schemes are exactly\nconservative. Numerical simulations are carried out and show that these\ninvariant variational schemes outperform standard numerical discretizations.",

    "abstract": "Majority-SAT is the problem of determining whether an input $n$-variable\nformula in conjunctive normal form (CNF) has at least $2^{n-1}$ satisfying\nassignments. Majority-SAT and related problems have been studied extensively in\nvarious AI communities interested in the complexity of probabilistic planning\nand inference. Although Majority-SAT has been known to be PP-complete for over\n40 years, the complexity of a natural variant has remained open:\nMajority-$k$SAT, where the input CNF formula is restricted to have clause width\nat most $k$.\nWe prove that for every $k$, Majority-$k$SAT is in P. In fact, for any\npositive integer $k$ and rational $\\rho \\in (0,1)$ with bounded denominator, we\ngive an algorithm that can determine whether a given $k$-CNF has at least $\\rho\n\\cdot 2^n$ satisfying assignments, in deterministic linear time (whereas the\nprevious best-known algorithm ran in exponential time). Our algorithms have\ninteresting positive implications for counting complexity and the complexity of\ninference, significantly reducing the known complexities of related problems\nsuch as E-MAJ-$k$SAT and MAJ-MAJ-$k$SAT. At the heart of our approach is an\nefficient method for solving threshold counting problems by extracting\nsunflowers found in the corresponding set system of a $k$-CNF.\nWe also show that the tractability of Majority-$k$SAT is somewhat fragile.\nFor the closely related GtMajority-SAT problem (where we ask whether a given\nformula has greater than $2^{n-1}$ satisfying assignments) which is known to be\nPP-complete, we show that GtMajority-$k$SAT is in P for $k\\le 3$, but becomes\nNP-complete for $k\\geq 4$. These results are counterintuitive, because the\n``natural'' classifications of these problems would have been PP-completeness,\nand because there is a stark difference in the complexity of GtMajority-$k$SAT\nand Majority-$k$SAT for all $k\\ge 4$.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores static non-uniform grid solvers that adapt three\nraster-based flood models on an optimised non-uniform grid: the second-order\ndiscontinuous Galerkin (DG2) model representing the modelled data as\npiecewise-planar fields, the first-order finite volume (FV1) model using\npiecewise-constant fields, and the local inertial (ACC) model only evolving\npiecewise-constant water depth fields. The optimised grid is generated by\napplying the multiresolution analysis (MRA) of multiwavelets (MWs) to\npiecewise-planar representation of raster-formatted topography data, for more\nsensible grid coarsening based on one user-specified parameter. Two adaptive\nsolvers are also explored that apply the MRA of MWs and of Haar wavelets (HWs)\nto, respectively, scale and adapt the DG2 (MWDG2) and FV1 (HWFV1) modelled data\ndynamically in time. The performance of the non-uniform grid and adaptive\nsolvers is assessed in terms of flood depth and extent, velocities, and CPU\nruntimes, with reference to the raster-based DG2 model predictions on their\nfinest resolution grid. The assessments considered three large-scale flooding\nscenarios, involving rapid and slow-to-gradual flows. MWDG2 is found to be the\nmost favourable choice when modelling rapid flows, where it excels in capturing\nsmall velocity variations. For slow-to-gradual flows, the adaptive solvers\ndeliver less accurate outcomes, and their efficiency can be hampered by\noverhead costs of the dynamic MRA. Instead, non-uniform DG2 is recommended to\ncapture urban flow interactions more accurately. Non-uniform ACC is 5 times\nfaster to run than non-uniform DG2 but delivers close flooding depth and extent\npredictions, thus is more attractive for fluvial/pluvial flood simulation over\nlarge areas.",

However, there is another label in\nthe CIDDS-001, AttackType, that seems very promising for this purpose and\nremains considerably unexplored.

To address key challenges of enabling FL over a wireless\nfog-cloud system (e.g., non-i.i.d. data, users' heterogeneity), we first\npropose an efficient FL algorithm (called FedFog) to perform the local\naggregation of gradient parameters at fog servers and global training update at\nthe cloud. Next, we employ FedFog in wireless fog-cloud systems by\ninvestigating a novel network-aware FL optimization problem that strikes the\nbalance between the global loss and completion time. An iterative algorithm is\nthen developed to obtain a precise measurement of the system performance, which\nhelps design an efficient stopping criteria to output an appropriate number of\nglobal rounds. To mitigate the straggler effect, we propose a flexible user\naggregation strategy that trains fast users first to obtain a certain level of\naccuracy before allowing slow users to join the global training updates.\nExtensive numerical results using several real-world FL tasks are provided to\nverify the theoretical convergence of FedFog.

    "abstract": "Hierarchical topic models such as the gamma belief network (GBN) have\ndelivered promising results in mining multi-layer document representations and\ndiscovering interpretable topic taxonomies. However, they often assume in the\nprior that the topics at each layer are independently drawn from the Dirichlet\ndistribution, ignoring the dependencies between the topics both at the same\nlayer and across different layers. To relax this assumption, we propose\nsawtooth factorial topic embedding guided GBN, a deep generative model of\ndocuments that captures the dependencies and semantic similarities between the\ntopics in the embedding space. Specifically, both the words and topics are\nrepresented as embedding vectors of the same dimension. The topic matrix at a\nlayer is factorized into the product of a factor loading matrix and a topic\nembedding matrix, the transpose of which is set as the factor loading matrix of\nthe layer above. Repeating this particular type of factorization, which shares\ncomponents between adjacent layers, leads to a structure referred to as\nsawtooth factorization. An auto-encoding variational inference network is\nconstructed to optimize the model parameter via stochastic gradient descent.\nExperiments on big corpora show that our models outperform other neural topic\nmodels on extracting deeper interpretable topics and deriving better document\nrepresentations.",

The problem is unsolvable by any number of anonymous\nagents in absence of a landmark node.

The assumption of agents with distinct identifiers is strictly\nweaker than having a landmark node as the problem is unsolvable by two agents\nwith distinct identifiers in absence of a landmark node. This setting has been\nrecently studied by Mandal et al. [ALGOSENSORS 2020]. There it is shown that\nthe problem is solvable in this setting by three agents assuming that they have\nedge crossing detection capability.

We model this as a\nstochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem with side-information, where the\ninterventions correspond to the arms of the bandit instance. First, we propose\na simple regret minimization algorithm that takes as input a semi-Markovian\ncausal graph with atomic interventions and possibly unobservable variables, and\nachieves $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{M/T})$ expected simple regret, where $M$ is dependent\non the input CBN and could be very small compared to the number of arms.

Our simple regret minimization results, both\nupper and lower bound, subsume previous results in the literature, which\nassumed additional structural restrictions on the input causal graph. In\nparticular, our results indicate that the simple regret guarantee of our\nproposed algorithm can only be improved by considering more nuanced structural\nrestrictions on the causal graph. Next, we propose a cumulative regret\nminimization algorithm that takes as input a general causal graph with all\nobservable nodes and atomic interventions and performs better than the optimal\nMAB algorithm that does not take causal side-information into account.

    "abstract": "Attack graphs (AG) are used to assess pathways availed by cyber adversaries\nto penetrate a network. State-of-the-art approaches for AG generation focus\nmostly on deriving dependencies between system vulnerabilities based on network\nscans and expert knowledge. In real-world operations however, it is costly and\nineffective to rely on constant vulnerability scanning and expert-crafted AGs.\nWe propose to automatically learn AGs based on actions observed through\nintrusion alerts, without prior expert knowledge. Specifically, we develop an\nunsupervised sequence learning system, SAGE, that leverages the temporal and\nprobabilistic dependence between alerts in a suffix-based probabilistic\ndeterministic finite automaton (S-PDFA) -- a model that accentuates infrequent\nsevere alerts and summarizes paths leading to them. AGs are then derived from\nthe S-PDFA. Tested with intrusion alerts collected through Collegiate\nPenetration Testing Competition, SAGE produces AGs that reflect the strategies\nused by participating teams. The resulting AGs are succinct, interpretable, and\nenable analysts to derive actionable insights, e.g., attackers tend to follow\nshorter paths after they have discovered a longer one.",

    "abstract": "How would a static scene react to a local poke? What are the effects on other\nparts of an object if you could locally push it? There will be distinctive\nmovement, despite evident variations caused by the stochastic nature of our\nworld. These outcomes are governed by the characteristic kinematics of objects\nthat dictate their overall motion caused by a local interaction. Conversely,\nthe movement of an object provides crucial information about its underlying\ndistinctive kinematics and the interdependencies between its parts. This\ntwo-way relation motivates learning a bijective mapping between object\nkinematics and plausible future image sequences. Therefore, we propose iPOKE -\ninvertible Prediction of Object Kinematics - that, conditioned on an initial\nframe and a local poke, allows to sample object kinematics and establishes a\none-to-one correspondence to the corresponding plausible videos, thereby\nproviding a controlled stochastic video synthesis. In contrast to previous\nworks, we do not generate arbitrary realistic videos, but provide efficient\ncontrol of movements, while still capturing the stochastic nature of our\nenvironment and the diversity of plausible outcomes it entails. Moreover, our\napproach can transfer kinematics onto novel object instances and is not\nconfined to particular object classes. Project page is available at\nhttps://bit.ly/3dJN4Lf",

    "abstract": "One common failure mode of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) models is fitting\nincorrect geometries when given an insufficient number of input views. We\npropose DS-NeRF (Depth-supervised Neural Radiance Fields), a loss for learning\nneural radiance fields that takes advantage of readily-available depth\nsupervision. Our key insight is that sparse depth supervision can be used to\nregularize the learned geometry, a crucial component for effectively rendering\nnovel views using NeRF. We exploit the fact that current NeRF pipelines require\nimages with known camera poses that are typically estimated by running\nstructure-from-motion (SFM). Crucially, SFM also produces sparse 3D points that\ncan be used as ``free\" depth supervision during training: we simply add a loss\nto ensure that depth rendered along rays that intersect these 3D points is\nclose to the observed depth. We find that DS-NeRF can render more accurate\nimages given fewer training views while training 2-6x faster. With only two\ntraining views on real-world images, DS-NeRF significantly outperforms NeRF as\nwell as other sparse-view variants. We show that our loss is compatible with\nthese NeRF models, demonstrating that depth is a cheap and easily digestible\nsupervisory signal. Finally, we show that DS-NeRF supports other types of depth\nsupervision such as scanned depth sensors and RGBD reconstruction outputs.",

    "abstract": "The universe is composed of galaxies that have diverse shapes. Once the\nstructure of a galaxy is determined, it is possible to obtain important\ninformation about its formation and evolution. Morphologically classifying\ngalaxies means cataloging them according to their visual appearance and the\nclassification is linked to the physical properties of the galaxy. A\nmorphological classification made through visual inspection is subject to\nbiases introduced by subjective observations made by human volunteers. For this\nreason, systematic, objective and easily reproducible classification of\ngalaxies has been gaining importance since the astronomer Edwin Hubble created\nhis famous classification method. In this work, we combine accurate visual\nclassifications of the Galaxy Zoo project with \\emph {Deep Learning} methods.\nThe goal is to find an efficient technique at human performance level\nclassification, but in a systematic and automatic way, for classification of\nelliptical and spiral galaxies. For this, a neural network model was created\nthrough an Ensemble of four other convolutional models, allowing a greater\naccuracy in the classification than what would be obtained with any one\nindividual. Details of the individual models and improvements made are also\ndescribed. The present work is entirely based on the analysis of images (not\nparameter tables) from DR1 (www.datalab.noao.edu) of the Southern Photometric\nLocal Universe Survey (S-PLUS). In terms of classification, we achieved, with\nthe Ensemble, an accuracy of $\\approx 99 \\%$ in the test sample (using\npre-trained networks).",

    "abstract": "Bone marrow cytology is required to make a hematological diagnosis,\ninfluencing critical clinical decision points in hematology. However, bone\nmarrow cytology is tedious, limited to experienced reference centers and\nassociated with high inter-observer variability. This may lead to a delayed or\nincorrect diagnosis, leaving an unmet need for innovative supporting\ntechnologies. We have developed the first ever end-to-end deep learning-based\ntechnology for automated bone marrow cytology. Starting with a bone marrow\naspirate digital whole slide image, our technology rapidly and automatically\ndetects suitable regions for cytology, and subsequently identifies and\nclassifies all bone marrow cells in each region. This collective\ncytomorphological information is captured in a novel representation called\nHistogram of Cell Types (HCT) quantifying bone marrow cell class probability\ndistribution and acting as a cytological \"patient fingerprint\". The approach\nachieves high accuracy in region detection (0.97 accuracy and 0.99 ROC AUC),\nand cell detection and cell classification (0.75 mAP, 0.78 F1-score,\nLog-average miss rate of 0.31).

To date, most of the proposed methods for DL-SR\nhave only been assessed by use of traditional measures of image quality (IQ)\nthat are commonly employed in the field of computer vision. However, the impact\nof these methods on objective measures of image quality that are relevant to\nmedical imaging tasks remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate\nthe impact of DL-SR methods on binary signal detection performance. Two popular\nDL-SR methods, the super-resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN) and\nthe super-resolution generative adversarial network (SRGAN), were trained by\nuse of simulated medical image data. Binary signal-known-exactly with\nbackground-known-statistically (SKE/BKS) and signal-known-statistically with\nbackground-known-statistically (SKS/BKS) detection tasks were formulated.\nNumerical observers, which included a neural network-approximated ideal\nobserver and common linear numerical observers, were employed to assess the\nimpact of DL-SR on task performance. The impact of the complexity of the DL-SR\nnetwork architectures on task-performance was quantified. In addition, the\nutility of DL-SR for improving the task-performance of sub-optimal observers\nwas investigated. Our numerical experiments confirmed that, as expected, DL-SR\ncould improve traditional measures of IQ. However, for many of the study\ndesigns considered, the DL-SR methods provided little or no improvement in task\nperformance and could even degrade it. It was observed that DL-SR could improve\nthe task-performance of sub-optimal observers under certain conditions. The\npresented study highlights the urgent need for the objective assessment of\nDL-SR methods and suggests avenues for improving their efficacy in medical\nimaging applications.",

Since\nthe conventional clustering-based speaker diarization (CSD) approach cannot\nwell handle overlapping speech segments, we investigate, in this study,\nseparation-based speaker diarization (SSD) which inherently has the potential\nto handle the speaker overlap regions. Our preliminary analysis shows that the\nstate-of-the-art Conv-TasNet based speech separation, which works quite well on\nthe simulation data, is unstable in realistic conversational speech due to the\nhigh mismatch speaking styles in simulated training speech and read speech. In\ndoing so, separation-based processing can assist CSD in handling the\noverlapping speech segments under the realistic mismatched conditions.\nSpecifically, several strategies are designed to select between the results of\nSSD and CSD systems based on an analysis of the instability of the SSD system\nperformances. Experiments on the conversational telephone speech (CTS) data\nfrom DIHARD-III Challenge show that the proposed SGSD system can significantly\nimprove the performance of state-of-the-art CSD systems, yielding relative\ndiarization error rate reductions of 20.2% and 20.8% on the development set and\nevaluation set, respectively.",

Despite the strong empirical\nperformance of such methods, they are not well understood theoretically. Our\nwork encapsulates representation methods using a subsampling approach, such as\nnode2vec, into a single unifying framework. We prove, under the assumption that\nthe graph is exchangeable, that the distribution of the learned embedding\nvectors asymptotically decouples. Moreover, we characterize the asymptotic\ndistribution and provided rates of convergence, in terms of the latent\nparameters, which includes the choice of loss function and the embedding\ndimension. This provides a theoretical foundation to understand what the\nembedding vectors represent and how well these methods perform on downstream\ntasks.

In recent years, several network architectures have been proposed to\nautomate this process and alleviate the burden of manual annotation. Although\nthe performance of these models has achieved promising results, there is still\nroom for improvement before these models can be used safely and effectively in\nclinical practice. One of the major challenges in prostate MR image\nsegmentation is the presence of class imbalance in the image labels where the\nbackground pixels dominate over the prostate.

The effect of\nDL-cropping for improving the segmentation performance compared to standard\ncenter-cropping is assessed using five popular DL networks for prostate\nsegmentation, namely U-net, U-net+, Res Unet++, Bridge U-net and Dense U-net.\nThe proposed smart-cropping outperformed the standard center cropping in terms\nof segmentation accuracy for all the evaluated prostate segmentation networks.\nIn terms of Dice score, the highest improvement was achieved for the U-net+ and\nResU-net++ architectures corresponding to 8.9% and 8%, respectively.",

Under one choice of prior, the SSVAE objective (i.e. the ELBO) is\nexactly equal to the mutual information (up to constants). Under an alternative\nchoice of prior, the SSVAE objective is exactly equal to the simplified\nparametric mutual information estimator used in InfoNCE (up to constants).\nImportantly, the use of simplified parametric mutual information estimators is\nbelieved to be critical to obtain good high-level representations, and the\nSSVAE framework naturally provides a principled justification for using prior\ninformation to choose these estimators.",

    "abstract": "Text-to-Speech synthesis systems are generally evaluated using Mean Opinion\nScore (MOS) tests, where listeners score samples of synthetic speech on a\nLikert scale. A major drawback of MOS tests is that they only offer a general\nmeasure of overall quality-i.e., the naturalness of an utterance-and so cannot\ntell us where exactly synthesis errors occur. This can make evaluation of the\nappropriateness of prosodic variation within utterances inconclusive. To\naddress this, we propose a novel evaluation method based on the Rapid Prosody\nTranscription paradigm. This allows listeners to mark the locations of errors\nin an utterance in real-time, providing a probabilistic representation of the\nperceptual errors that occur in the synthetic signal. We conduct experiments\nthat confirm that the fine-grained evaluation can be mapped to system rankings\nof standard MOS tests, but the error marking gives a much more comprehensive\nassessment of synthesized prosody. In particular, for standard audiobook test\nset samples, we see that error marks consistently cluster around words at major\nprosodic boundaries indicated by punctuation. However, for question-answer\nbased stimuli, where we control information structure, we see differences\nemerge in the ability of neural TTS systems to generate context-appropriate\nprosodic prominence.",

    "abstract": "The lower the distortion of an estimator, the more the distribution of its\noutputs generally deviates from the distribution of the signals it attempts to\nestimate. This phenomenon, known as the perception-distortion tradeoff, has\ncaptured significant attention in image restoration, where it implies that\nfidelity to ground truth images comes at the expense of perceptual quality\n(deviation from statistics of natural images). However, despite the increasing\npopularity of performing comparisons on the perception-distortion plane, there\nremains an important open question: what is the minimal distortion that can be\nachieved under a given perception constraint? In this paper, we derive a closed\nform expression for this distortion-perception (DP) function for the mean\nsquared-error (MSE) distortion and the Wasserstein-2 perception index. We prove\nthat the DP function is always quadratic, regardless of the underlying\ndistribution. This stems from the fact that estimators on the DP curve form a\ngeodesic in Wasserstein space. In the Gaussian setting, we further provide a\nclosed form expression for such estimators. For general distributions, we show\nhow these estimators can be constructed from the estimators at the two extremes\nof the tradeoff: The global MSE minimizer, and a minimizer of the MSE under a\nperfect perceptual quality constraint. The latter can be obtained as a\nstochastic transformation of the former.",

    "abstract": "Modelling the process that a listener actuates in deriving the words intended\nby a speaker requires setting a hypothesis on how lexical items are stored in\nmemory. This work aims at developing a system that imitates humans when\nidentifying words in running speech and, in this way, provide a framework to\nbetter understand human speech processing. We build a speech recognizer for\nItalian based on the principles of Stevens' model of Lexical Access in which\nwords are stored as hierarchical arrangements of distinctive features (Stevens,\nK. N.

Over the\npast few decades, the Speech Communication Group at the Massachusetts Institute\nof Technology (MIT) developed a speech recognition system for English based on\nthis approach. Italian will be the first language beyond English to be\nexplored; the extension to another language provides the opportunity to test\nthe hypothesis that words are represented in memory as a set of\nhierarchically-arranged distinctive features, and reveal which of the\nunderlying mechanisms may have a language-independent nature. This paper also\nintroduces a new Lexical Access corpus, the LaMIT database, created and labeled\nspecifically for this work, that will be provided freely to the speech research\ncommunity.

    "title": "Submodular Order Functions and Assortment Optimization",
    "abstract": "We define a new class of set functions that in addition to being monotone and\nsubadditive, also admit a very limited form of submodularity defined over a\npermutation of the ground set. We refer to this permutation as a submodular\norder. This class of functions includes monotone submodular functions as a\nsub-family. To understand the importance of this structure in optimization\nproblems we consider the problem of maximizing function value under various\ntypes of constraints.\nTo demonstrate the modeling power of submodular order functions we show\napplications in two different settings. First, we apply our results to the\nextensively studied problem of assortment optimization. While the objectives in\nassortment optimization are known to be non-submodular (and non-monotone) even\nfor simple choice models, we show that they are compatible with the notion of\nsubmodular order. Consequently, we obtain new and in some cases the first\nconstant factor guarantee for constrained assortment optimization in\nfundamental choice models. As a second application of submodular order\nfunctions, we show an intriguing algorithmic connection to the maximization of\nmonotone submodular functions in the streaming model. We recover some best\nknown guarantees for this problem as a corollary of our results.",

    "title": "Quantum Annealing Formulation for Binary Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Quantum annealing is a promising paradigm for building practical quantum\ncomputers. Compared to other approaches, quantum annealing technology has been\nscaled up to a larger number of qubits. On the other hand, deep learning has\nbeen profoundly successful in pushing the boundaries of AI. It is thus natural\nto investigate potentially game changing technologies such as quantum annealers\nto augment the capabilities of deep learning. In this work, we explore binary\nneural networks, which are lightweight yet powerful models typically intended\nfor resource constrained devices. Departing from current training regimes for\nbinary networks that smooth/approximate the activation functions to make the\nnetwork differentiable, we devise a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization\nformulation for the training problem. While the problem is intractable, i.e.,\nthe cost to estimate the binary weights scales exponentially with network size,\nwe show how the problem can be optimized directly on a quantum annealer,\nthereby opening up to the potential gains of quantum computing. We\nexperimentally validated our formulation via simulation and testing on an\nactual quantum annealer (D-Wave Advantage), the latter to the extent allowable\nby the capacity of current technology.",

    "title": "Frequency Shift Algorithm: Design of a Baseband Phase Locked Loop for  Frequency-Domain Multiplexing Readout of X-ray Transition-Edge Sensor  Microcalorimeters",
    "abstract": "The Transition-Edge Sensor (TES) is an extremely sensitive device which is\nused to measure the energy of individual X-ray photons. For astronomical\nspectrometry applications, SRON develops a Frequency Domain Multiplexing (FDM)\nread-out system for kilopixel arrays of such TESs. Each TES is voltage biased\nat a specific frequency in the range 1 to 5 MHz. Isolation between the\nindividual pixels is obtained through very narrow-band (high-Q) lithographic LC\nresonators. To prevent energy resolution degradation due to intermodulation\nline noise, the bias frequencies are distributed on a regular grid. The\nrequirements on the accuracy of the LC resonance frequency are very high. The\ndeviation of the resonance frequencies due to production tolerances is\nsignificant with respect to the bandwidth, and a controller is necessary to\ncompensate for the LC series impedance. We present two such controllers: a\nsimple orthogonal proportional-integrating (PI) controller and a more complex\nimpedance estimator. Both controllers operate in baseband and try to make the\nTES current in-phase with the bias voltage, effectively operating as\nphase-locked loops (PLL). They allow off-LC-resonance operation of the TES\npixels, while preserving TES thermal response and energy resolution. Extensive\nexperimental results -- published in a companion paper recently -- with the\nproposed methods, show that these controllers allow the preservation of single\npixel energy resolution in multiplexed operation.",

    "abstract": "The peer-to-peer (P2P) economy has been growing with the advent of the\nInternet, with well known brands such as Uber or Airbnb being examples thereof.\nIn the insurance sector the approach is still in its infancy, but some\ncompanies have started to explore P2P-based collaborative insurance products\n(eg. Lemonade in the U.S. or Inspeer in France). The actuarial literature only\nrecently started to consider those risk sharing mechanisms, as in Denuit and\nRobert (2021) or Feng et al. (2021). In this paper, describe and analyse such a\nP2P product, with some reciprocal risk sharing contracts. Here, we consider the\ncase where policyholders still have an insurance contract, but the first\nself-insurance layer, below the deductible, can be shared with friends. We\nstudy the impact of the shape of the network (through the distribution of\ndegrees) on the risk reduction. We consider also some optimal setting of the\nreciprocal commitments, and discuss the introduction of contracts with friends\nof friends to mitigate some possible drawbacks of having people without enough\nconnections to exchange risks.",

The standard workflow for empirical\nresearch involves data cleaning followed by data analysis that typically\nignores the bias and variance consequences of data cleaning. We formulate a\nsemiparametric model for causal inference with corrupted data to encompass both\ndata cleaning and data analysis. We propose a new end-to-end procedure for data\ncleaning, estimation, and inference with data cleaning-adjusted confidence\nintervals. We prove root-n consistency, Gaussian approximation, and\nsemiparametric efficiency for our estimator of the causal parameter by finite\nsample arguments. Our key assumption is that the true covariates are\napproximately low rank. In our analysis, we provide nonasymptotic theoretical\ncontributions to matrix completion, statistical learning, and semiparametric\nstatistics. We verify the coverage of the data cleaning-adjusted confidence\nintervals in simulations.",
