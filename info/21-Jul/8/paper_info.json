    "abstract": "In this work we implement the so-called matching time estimators for\nestimating the entropy rate as well as the entropy production rate for symbolic\nsequences. These estimators are based on recurrence properties of the system,\nwhich have been shown to be appropriate to test irreversibility specially when\nthe sequences have large correlations or memory. Based on limit theorems for\nmatching-times we derive a maximum likelihood estimator for entropy rate\nassuming that we have a set of moderately short symbolic time-series of finite\nrandom duration. We show that the proposed estimator has several properties\nthat makes it adequate to estimate entropy rate and entropy production rate (or\nto test irreversibility) when the sample sequences have different lengths such\nas the coding sequences of DNA. We test our approach in some controlled\nexamples of Markov chains. We also implement our estimators in genomic\nsequences to show that the degree of irreversibility coding sequences of human\nDNA is significantly larger than the corresponding non-coding sequences.",

Early methods for MER mainly based on traditional\nappearance and geometry features. Recently, with the success of deep learning\n(DL) in various fields, neural networks have received increasing interests in\nMER. Different from macro-expressions, MEs are spontaneous, subtle, and rapid\nfacial movements, leading to difficult data collection, thus have small-scale\ndatasets. DL based MER becomes challenging due to above ME characters. To data,\nvarious DL approaches have been proposed to solve the ME issues and improve MER\nperformance. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of deep\nmicro-expression recognition (MER), including datasets, deep MER pipeline, and\nthe bench-marking of most influential methods. This survey defines a new\ntaxonomy for the field, encompassing all aspects of MER based on DL. For each\naspect, the basic approaches and advanced developments are summarized and\ndiscussed. In addition, we conclude the remaining challenges and and potential\ndirections for the design of robust deep MER systems.

However, such graphs are not conducive to direct programmatic analysis\ndue to the lack of automatic tools. In this paper, we develop a plot digitizer,\nnamed Plot2Spectra, to extract data points from spectroscopy graph images in an\nautomatic fashion, which makes it possible for large scale data acquisition and\nanalysis. Specifically, the plot digitizer is a two-stage framework. In the\nfirst axis alignment stage, we adopt an anchor-free detector to detect the plot\nregion and then refine the detected bounding boxes with an edge-based\nconstraint to locate the position of two axes. We also apply scene text\ndetector to extract and interpret all tick information below the x-axis. In the\nsecond plot data extraction stage, we first employ semantic segmentation to\nseparate pixels belonging to plot lines from the background, and from there,\nincorporate optical flow constraints to the plot line pixels to assign them to\nthe appropriate line (data instance) they encode.

    "abstract": "Understanding the spread of false or dangerous beliefs - so-called\nmis/disinformation - through a population has never seemed so urgent to many.\nNetwork science researchers have often taken a page from epidemiologists, and\nmodeled the spread of false beliefs as similar to how a disease spreads through\na social network. However, absent from those disease-inspired models is an\ninternal model of an individual's set of current beliefs, where cognitive\nscience has increasingly documented how the interaction between mental models\nand incoming messages seems to be crucially important for their adoption or\nrejection. We introduce a cognitive contagion model that combines a network\nscience approach with an internal cognitive model of the individual agents,\naffecting what they believe, and what they pass on. We show that the model,\neven with a very discrete and simplistic belief function to capture cognitive\ndissonance, both adds expressive power over existing disease-based contagion\nmodels, and qualitatively demonstrates the appropriate belief update phenomena\nat the individual level. Moreover, we situate our cognitive contagion model in\na larger public opinion diffusion model, which attempts to capture the role of\ninstitutions or media sources in belief diffusion - something that is often\nleft out. We conduct an analysis of the POD model with our simple cognitive\ndissonance-sensitive update function across various graph topologies and\ninstitutional messaging patterns. We demonstrate that population-level\naggregate outcomes of the model qualitatively match what has been reported in\nCOVID misinformation public opinion polls. The overall model sets up a\npreliminary framework with which social science misinformation researchers and\ncomputational opinion diffusion modelers can join forces to understand, and\nhopefully learn how to best counter, the spread of misinformation and\n\"alternative facts.\"",

We empirically validate the benefits of RAILS through several\nadversarial image classification experiments on MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10\ndatasets.

    "abstract": "The goal of Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA) is to find\nanswers for natural language questions over a knowledge graph. Recent KGQA\napproaches adopt a neural machine translation (NMT) approach, where the natural\nlanguage question is translated into a structured query language. However, NMT\nsuffers from the out-of-vocabulary problem, where terms in a question may not\nhave been seen during training, impeding their translation. This issue is\nparticularly problematic for the millions of entities that large knowledge\ngraphs describe. We rather propose a KGQA approach that delegates the\nprocessing of entities to entity linking (EL) systems. NMT is then used to\ncreate a query template with placeholders that are filled by entities\nidentified in an EL phase. Slot filling is used to decide which entity fills\nwhich placeholder. Experiments for QA over Wikidata show that our approach\noutperforms pure NMT: while there remains a strong dependence on having seen\nsimilar query templates during training, errors relating to entities are\ngreatly reduced.",

    "title": "Telescoping Filter: A Practical Adaptive Filter",
    "abstract": "Filters are fast, small and approximate set membership data structures. They\nare often used to filter out expensive accesses to a remote set S for negative\nqueries (that is, a query x not in S). Filters have one-sided errors: on a\nnegative query, a filter may say \"present\" with a tunable false-positve\nprobability of epsilon. Correctness is traded for space: filters only use log\n(1/\\epsilon) + O(1) bits per element.\nThe false-positive guarantees of most filters, however, hold only for a\nsingle query. In particular, if x is a false positive of a filter, a subsequent\nquery to x is a false positive with probability 1, not epsilon. With this in\nmind, recent work has introduced the notion of an adaptive filter. A filter is\nadaptive if each query has false positive epsilon, regardless of what queries\nwere made in the past. This requires \"fixing\" false positives as they occur.\nAdaptive filters not only provide strong false positive guarantees in\nadversarial environments but also improve performance on query practical\nworkloads by eliminating repeated false positives.\nExisting work on adaptive filters falls into two categories. First, there are\npractical filters based on cuckoo filters that attempt to fix false positives\nheuristically, without meeting the adaptivity guarantee. Meanwhile, the broom\nfilter is a very complex adaptive filter that meets the optimal theoretical\nbounds.\nIn this paper, we bridge this gap by designing a practical, provably adaptive\nfilter: the telescoping adaptive filter. We provide theoretical false-positive\nand space guarantees of our filter, along with empirical results where we\ncompare its false positive performance against state-of-the-art filters. We\nalso test the throughput of our filters, showing that they achieve comparable\nperformance to similar non-adaptive filters.",

Our main result is that a polynomial kernel for\n$k$-Dominating Set on graphs of twin-width at most 4 would contradict a\nstandard complexity-theoretic assumption. The reduction is quite involved,\nespecially to get the twin-width upper bound down to 4, and can be tweaked to\nwork for Connected $k$-Dominating Set and Total $k$-Dominating Set (albeit with\na worse upper bound on the twin-width). The $k$-Independent Set problem admits\nthe same lower bound by a much simpler argument, previously observed [ICALP\n'21], which extends to $k$-Independent Dominating Set, $k$-Path, $k$-Induced\nPath, $k$-Induced Matching, etc. On the positive side, we obtain a simple\nquadratic vertex kernel for Connected $k$-Vertex Cover and Capacitated\n$k$-Vertex Cover on graphs of bounded twin-width. Interestingly the kernel\napplies to graphs of Vapnik-Chervonenkis density 1, and does not require a\nwitness sequence. We also present a more intricate $O(k^{1.5})$ vertex kernel\nfor Connected $k$-Vertex Cover. Finally we show that deciding if a graph has\ntwin-width at most 1 can be done in polynomial time, and observe that most\noptimization/decision graph problems can be solved in polynomial time on graphs\nof twin-width at most 1.",

In assessing the validity of an NMA, it is therefore\nimportant to know the proportion contributions of each direct treatment\ncomparison to each network treatment effect. The construction of proportion\ncontributions is based on the observation that each row of the hat matrix\nrepresents a so-called 'evidence flow network' for each treatment comparison.\nHowever, the existing algorithm used to calculate these values is associated\nwith ambiguity according to the selection of paths. In this work we present a\nnovel analogy between NMA and random walks. We use this analogy to derive\nclosed-form expressions for the proportion contributions. A random walk on a\ngraph is a stochastic process that describes a succession of random 'hops'\nbetween vertices which are connected by an edge. The weight of an edge relates\nto the probability that the walker moves along that edge. We use the graph\nrepresentation of NMA to construct the transition matrix for a random walk on\nthe network of evidence. We show that the net number of times a walker crosses\neach edge of the network is related to the evidence flow network. By then\ndefining a random walk on the directed evidence flow network, we derive\nanalytically the matrix of proportion contributions.

    "abstract": "The success of software crowdsourcing depends on active and trustworthy pool\nof worker supply. The uncertainty of crowd workers' behaviors makes it\nchallenging to predict workers' success and plan accordingly. In a competitive\ncrowdsourcing marketplace, competition for success over shared tasks adds\nanother layer of uncertainty in crowd workers' decision-making process.\nPreliminary analysis on software worker behaviors reveals an alarming task\ndropping rate of 82.9%. These factors lead to the need for an automated\nrecommendation system for CSD workers to improve the visibility and\npredictability of their success in the competition. To that end, this paper\nproposes a collaborative recommendation system for crowd workers. The proposed\nrecommendation system method uses five input metrics based on workers'\ncollaboration history in the pool, workers' preferences in taking tasks in\nterms of monetary prize and duration, workers' specialty, and workers'\nproficiency. The proposed method then recommends the most suitable tasks for a\nworker to compete on based on workers' probability of success in the task.\nExperimental results on 260 active crowd workers demonstrate that just\nfollowing the top three success probabilities of task recommendations, workers\ncan achieve success up to 86%",

These arms are dexterous and high-dimensional; however, the\ninterfaces people must use to control their robots are low-dimensional.\nConsider teleoperating a 7-DoF robot arm with a 2-DoF joystick. The robot is\nhelping you eat dinner, and currently you want to cut a piece of tofu. Today's\nrobots assume a pre-defined mapping between joystick inputs and robot actions:\nin one mode the joystick controls the robot's motion in the x-y plane, in\nanother mode the joystick controls the robot's z-yaw motion, and so on. But\nthis mapping misses out on the task you are trying to perform! Ideally, one\njoystick axis should control how the robot stabs the tofu and the other axis\nshould control different cutting motions. Our insight is that we can achieve\nintuitive, user-friendly control of assistive robots by embedding the robot's\nhigh-dimensional actions into low-dimensional and human-controllable latent\nactions. We divide this process into three parts. First, we explore models for\nlearning latent actions from offline task demonstrations, and formalize the\nproperties that latent actions should satisfy. Next, we combine learned latent\nactions with autonomous robot assistance to help the user reach and maintain\ntheir high-level goals. Finally, we learn a personalized alignment model\nbetween joystick inputs and latent actions. We evaluate our resulting approach\nin four user studies where non-disabled participants reach marshmallows, cook\napple pie, cut tofu, and assemble dessert.

    "abstract": "Modeling the time evolution of discrete sets of items (e.g., genetic\nmutations) is a fundamental problem in many biomedical applications. We\napproach this problem through the lens of continuous-time Markov chains, and\nshow that the resulting learning task is generally underspecified in the usual\nsetting of cross-sectional data. We explore a perhaps surprising remedy:\nincluding a number of additional independent items can help determine time\norder, and hence resolve underspecification. This is in sharp contrast to the\ncommon practice of limiting the analysis to a small subset of relevant items,\nwhich is followed largely due to poor scaling of existing methods. To put our\ntheoretical insight into practice, we develop an approximate likelihood\nmaximization method for learning continuous-time Markov chains, which can scale\nto hundreds of items and is orders of magnitude faster than previous methods.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on synthetic and real cancer\ndata.",

    "abstract": "We study the fault-tolerant variant of the online bin packing problem.\nSimilar to the classic bin packing problem, an online sequence of items of\nvarious sizes should be packed into a minimum number of bins of uniform\ncapacity. For applications such as server consolidation, where bins represent\nservers and items represent jobs of different loads, it is required to maintain\nfault-tolerant solutions. In a fault-tolerant packing, any job is replicated\ninto f+1 servers, for some integer f > 1, so that the failure of up to f\nservers does not interrupt service. We build over a practical model introduced\nby Li and Tang [SPAA 2017] in which each job of load $x$ has a primary replica\nof load $x$ and $f$ standby replicas, each of load $x/\\eta$, where $\\eta >1$ is\na parameter of the problem. Upon failure of up to $f$ servers, any primary\nreplica in a failed bin should be replaced by one of its standby replicas so\nthat the extra load of the new primary replica does not cause an overflow in\nits bin. We study a general setting in which bins might fail while the input is\nstill being revealed. Our main contribution is an algorithm, named\nHarmonic-Stretch, which maintains fault-tolerant packings under this general\nsetting. We prove that Harmonic-Stretch has an asymptotic competitive ratio of\nat most 1.75. This is an improvement over the best existing asymptotic\ncompetitive ratio 2 of an algorithm by Li and Tang [TPDS 2020], which works\nunder a model in which bins fail only after all items are packed.",

    "abstract": "Normalizing flows are a widely used class of latent-variable generative\nmodels with a tractable likelihood. Affine-coupling (Dinh et al, 2014-16)\nmodels are a particularly common type of normalizing flows, for which the\nJacobian of the latent-to-observable-variable transformation is triangular,\nallowing the likelihood to be computed in linear time. Despite the widespread\nusage of affine couplings, the special structure of the architecture makes\nunderstanding their representational power challenging. The question of\nuniversal approximation was only recently resolved by three parallel papers\n(Huang et al.,2020;Zhang et al.,2020;Koehler et al.,2020) -- who showed\nreasonably regular distributions can be approximated arbitrarily well using\naffine couplings -- albeit with networks with a nearly-singular Jacobian. As\nill-conditioned Jacobians are an obstacle for likelihood-based training, the\nfundamental question remains: which distributions can be approximated using\nwell-conditioned affine coupling flows?\nIn this paper, we show that any log-concave distribution can be approximated\nusing well-conditioned affine-coupling flows. In terms of proof techniques, we\nuncover and leverage deep connections between affine coupling architectures,\nunderdamped Langevin dynamics (a stochastic differential equation often used to\nsample from Gibbs measures) and H\\'enon maps (a structured dynamical system\nthat appears in the study of symplectic diffeomorphisms). Our results also\ninform the practice of training affine couplings: we approximate a padded\nversion of the input distribution with iid Gaussians -- a strategy which\nKoehler et al.(2020) empirically observed to result in better-conditioned\nflows, but had hitherto no theoretical grounding. Our proof can thus be seen as\nproviding theoretical evidence for the benefits of Gaussian padding when\ntraining normalizing flows.",

In order to\nimprove the visual representation ability for transformers, we propose a new\nsearch space and searching algorithm.

With the locality module, our search space is defined to\nlet the search algorithm freely trade off between global and local information\nas well as optimizing the low-level design choice in each module. To tackle the\nproblem caused by huge search space, a hierarchical neural architecture search\nmethod is proposed to search the optimal vision transformer from two levels\nseparately with the evolutionary algorithm.

To help address these limitations in the future, we\nintroduce \"Telelife,\" a vision for the near future that depicts the potential\nmeans to improve remote living better aligned with how we interact, live and\nwork in the physical world. Telelife encompasses novel synergies of\ntechnologies and concepts such as digital twins, virtual prototyping, and\nattention and context-aware user interfaces with innovative hardware that can\nsupport ultrarealistic graphics, user state detection, and more. These ideas\nwill guide the transformation of our daily lives and routines soon, targeting\nthe year 2035. In addition, we identify opportunities across high-impact\napplications in domains related to this vision of Telelife. Along with a recent\nsurvey of relevant fields such as human-computer interaction, pervasive\ncomputing, and virtual reality, the directions outlined in this paper will\nguide future research on remote living.",

    "abstract": "Based on PixelHop and PixelHop++, which are recently developed using the\nsuccessive subspace learning (SSL) framework, we propose an enhanced solution\nfor object classification, called E-PixelHop, in this work. E-PixelHop consists\nof the following steps. First, to decouple the color channels for a color\nimage, we apply principle component analysis and project RGB three color\nchannels onto two principle subspaces which are processed separately for\nclassification. Second, to address the importance of multi-scale features, we\nconduct pixel-level classification at each hop with various receptive fields.\nThird, to further improve pixel-level classification accuracy, we develop a\nsupervised label smoothing (SLS) scheme to ensure prediction consistency.\nForth, pixel-level decisions from each hop and from each color subspace are\nfused together for image-level decision. Fifth, to resolve confusing classes\nfor further performance boosting, we formulate E-PixelHop as a two-stage\npipeline. In the first stage, multi-class classification is performed to get a\nsoft decision for each class, where the top 2 classes with the highest\nprobabilities are called confusing classes. Then,we conduct a binary\nclassification in the second stage. The main contributions lie in Steps 1, 3\nand 5.We use the classification of the CIFAR-10 dataset as an example to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the above-mentioned key components of\nE-PixelHop.",

Our proposed approach is\nbased around the idea that true depth edges are more sensitive than texture\nedges to local constraints, and so they can be reliably disambiguated through a\nbidirectional diffusion process. First, we use epipolar-plane images to\nestimate sub-pixel disparity at a sparse set of pixels. To find sparse points\nefficiently, we propose an entropy-based refinement approach to a line estimate\nfrom a limited set of oriented filter banks. Next, to estimate the diffusion\ndirection away from sparse points, we optimize constraints at these points via\nour bidirectional diffusion method. This resolves the ambiguity of which\nsurface the edge belongs to and reliably separates depth from texture edges,\nallowing us to diffuse the sparse set in a depth-edge and occlusion-aware\nmanner to obtain accurate dense depth maps.",

    "abstract": "Recent research has seen numerous supervised learning-based methods for 3D\nshape segmentation and remarkable performance has been achieved on various\nbenchmark datasets. These supervised methods require a large amount of\nannotated data to train deep neural networks to ensure the generalization\nability on the unseen test set. In this paper, we introduce a\nmeta-learning-based method for few-shot 3D shape segmentation where only a few\nlabeled samples are provided for the unseen classes. To achieve this, we treat\nthe shape segmentation as a point labeling problem in the metric space.\nSpecifically, we first design a meta-metric learner to transform input shapes\ninto embedding space and our model learns to learn a proper metric space for\neach object class based on point embeddings. Then, for each class, we design a\nmetric learner to extract part-specific prototype representations from a few\nsupport shapes and our model performs per-point segmentation over the query\nshapes by matching each point to its nearest prototype in the learned metric\nspace. A metric-based loss function is used to dynamically modify distances\nbetween point embeddings thus maximizes in-part similarity while minimizing\ninter-part similarity. A dual segmentation branch is adopted to make full use\nof the support information and implicitly encourages consistency between the\nsupport and query prototypes. We demonstrate the superior performance of our\nproposed on the ShapeNet part dataset under the few-shot scenario, compared\nwith well-established baseline and state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods.",

To solve this\nissue, we rethink HS image classification from a sequential perspective with\ntransformers, and propose a novel backbone network called \\ul{SpectralFormer}.\nBeyond band-wise representations in classic transformers, SpectralFormer is\ncapable of learning spectrally local sequence information from neighboring\nbands of HS images, yielding group-wise spectral embeddings.

Prior to\nimplantation, the canine's cluster seizures evolved to status epilepticus (SE)\nand required emergency pharmacological intervention. The cranially-mounted\nsystem was fully-implanted bilaterally into the centromedian nucleus of the\nthalamus. Using combinations of time-based modulation, thalamocortical\nrhythm-specific tuning of frequency parameters, and fast-adaptive modes based\non activity, the canine has experienced no further SE events post-implant at\nthe time of writing (7 months), and no significant clusters are observed any\nlonger. The use of digitally-enabled chronotherapy as a feedforward signal to\naugment adaptive neurostimulators could prove a useful algorithmic method where\nsensitivity to temporal patterns are characteristics of the disease state.",

    "abstract": "There is significant interest in learning and optimizing a complex system\ncomposed of multiple sub-components, where these components may be agents or\nautonomous sensors. Among the rich literature on this topic, agent-based and\ndomain-specific simulations can capture complex dynamics and subgroup\ninteraction, but optimizing over such simulations can be computationally and\nalgorithmically challenging. Bayesian approaches, such as Gaussian processes\n(GPs), can be used to learn a computationally tractable approximation to the\nunderlying dynamics but typically neglect the detailed information about\nsubgroups in the complicated system. We attempt to find the best of both worlds\nby proposing the idea of decomposed feedback, which captures group-based\nheterogeneity and dynamics. We introduce a novel decomposed GP regression to\nincorporate the subgroup decomposed feedback. Our modified regression has\nprovably lower variance -- and thus a more accurate posterior -- compared to\nprevious approaches; it also allows us to introduce a decomposed GP-UCB\noptimization algorithm that leverages subgroup feedback. The Bayesian nature of\nour method makes the optimization algorithm trackable with a theoretical\nguarantee on convergence and no-regret property.

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) aims to solve tasks in target domain\nby utilizing transferable information learned from the available source domain\nand a few labeled target data. However, source data is not always accessible in\npractical scenarios, which restricts the application of SSDA in real world\ncircumstances. In this paper, we propose a novel task named Semi-supervised\nSource Hypothesis Transfer (SSHT), which performs domain adaptation based on\nsource trained model, to generalize well in target domain with a few\nsupervisions. In SSHT, we are facing two challenges: (1) The insufficient\nlabeled target data may result in target features near the decision boundary,\nwith the increased risk of mis-classification; (2) The data are usually\nimbalanced in source domain, so the model trained with these data is biased.\nThe biased model is prone to categorize samples of minority categories into\nmajority ones, resulting in low prediction diversity. To tackle the above\nissues, we propose Consistency and Diversity Learning (CDL), a simple but\neffective framework for SSHT by facilitating prediction consistency between two\nrandomly augmented unlabeled data and maintaining the prediction diversity when\nadapting model to target domain. Encouraging consistency regularization brings\ndifficulty to memorize the few labeled target data and thus enhances the\ngeneralization ability of the learned model. We further integrate Batch\nNuclear-norm Maximization into our method to enhance the discriminability and\ndiversity. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing SSDA\nmethods and unsupervised model adaptation methods on DomainNet, Office-Home and\nOffice-31 datasets.

We introduce a new solution to this problem by performing\ncontrast maximization in 3D.

Existing CF-based\nmethods commonly adopt negative sampling to discriminate different items. That\nis, observed user-item pairs are treated as positive instances; unobserved\npairs are considered as negative instances and are sampled under a defined\ndistribution for training. Training with negative sampling on large datasets is\ncomputationally expensive. Further, negative items should be carefully sampled\nunder the defined distribution, in order to avoid selecting an observed\npositive item in the training dataset. Unavoidably, some negative items sampled\nfrom the training dataset could be positive in the test set.

This paper\npresents a versatile image translation and manipulation framework that achieves\naccurate semantic and style guidance in image generation by explicitly building\na correspondence. To handle the quadratic complexity incurred by building the\ndense correspondences, we introduce a bi-level feature alignment strategy that\nadopts a top-$k$ operation to rank block-wise features followed by dense\nattention between block features which reduces memory cost substantially. As\nthe top-$k$ operation involves index swapping which precludes the gradient\npropagation, we propose to approximate the non-differentiable top-$k$ operation\nwith a regularized earth mover's problem so that its gradient can be\neffectively back-propagated. In addition, we design a novel semantic position\nencoding mechanism that builds up coordinate for each individual semantic\nregion to preserve texture structures while building correspondences. Further,\nwe design a novel confidence feature injection module which mitigates mismatch\nproblem by fusing features adaptively according to the reliability of built\ncorrespondences.

This requires anchoring\nperceptual information onto symbols that represent the objects in the\nenvironment. In this paper, we present a model for action-aware perceptual\nanchoring that enables robots to track objects in a persistent manner. Our\nrule-based approach considers inductive biases to perform high-level reasoning\nover the results from low-level object detection, and it improves the robot's\nperceptual capability for complex tasks.

    "abstract": "The cost-sharing connection game is a variant of routing games on a network.\nIn this model, given a directed graph with edge-costs and edge-capacities, each\nagent wants to construct a path from a source to a sink with low cost. The cost\nof each edge is shared by the users based on a cost-sharing function. One of\nsimple cost-sharing functions is defined as the cost divided by the number of\nusers. In fact, most of the previous papers about cost-sharing connection games\naddressed this cost-sharing function. It models an ideal setting, where no\noverhead arises when people share things, though it might be quite rare in real\nlife; it is more realistic to consider the setting that the cost paid by an\nagent is the original cost per the number of the agents plus the overhead. In\nthis paper, we model the more realistic scenario of cost-sharing connection\ngames by generalizing cost-sharing functions. The arguments on the model do not\ndepend on specific cost-sharing functions, and are applicable for a wide class\nof cost-sharing functions satisfying the following natural properties: they are\n(1) non-increasing, (2) lower bounded by the original cost per the number of\nthe agents, and (3) upper bounded by the original cost, which enables to\nrepresent various scenarios of cost-sharing. We investigate the Price of\nAnarchy (PoA) and the Price of Stability (PoS) under sum-cost and max-cost\ncriteria with the generalized cost-sharing function. In spite of the\ngeneralization, we obtain the same bounds of PoA and PoS as the cost-sharing\nwith no overhead except PoS under sum-cost. Note that these bounds are tight.\nIn the case of sum-cost, the lower bound on PoS increases from $\\log n$ to\n$n+1/n-1$ by the generalization, which is also almost tight because the upper\nbound is $n$.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning is found to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. However, its\nadversarial susceptibility in image caption generation is under-explored. We\nstudy adversarial examples for vision and language models, which typically\nadopt an encoder-decoder framework consisting of two major components: a\nConvolutional Neural Network (i.e., CNN) for image feature extraction and a\nRecurrent Neural Network (RNN) for caption generation. In particular, we\ninvestigate attacks on the visual encoder's hidden layer that is fed to the\nsubsequent recurrent network. The existing methods either attack the\nclassification layer of the visual encoder or they back-propagate the gradients\nfrom the language model. In contrast, we propose a GAN-based algorithm for\ncrafting adversarial examples for neural image captioning that mimics the\ninternal representation of the CNN such that the resulting deep features of the\ninput image enable a controlled incorrect caption generation through the\nrecurrent network. Our contribution provides new insights for understanding\nadversarial attacks on vision systems with language component. The proposed\nmethod employs two strategies for a comprehensive evaluation. The first\nexamines if a neural image captioning system can be misled to output targeted\nimage captions. The second analyzes the possibility of keywords into the\npredicted captions. Experiments show that our algorithm can craft effective\nadversarial images based on the CNN hidden layers to fool captioning framework.\nMoreover, we discover the proposed attack to be highly transferable.

The experiments show\nsignificant reduction in reconstruction errors of mel-spectrogram in the\ntraining of multi-speaker generative model, and a great improvement is observed\nin the subjective evaluation of speaker adapted model, e.g, the Mean Opinion\nScore (MOS) of intelligibility increases by 0.81 points.",

We enrich POU-Nets with a Gaussian\nnoise model to obtain a probabilistic generalization amenable to gradient-based\nminimization of a maximum likelihood loss. The resulting architecture provides\nspatial representations of both noiseless and noisy data as Gaussian mixtures\nwith closed form expressions for variance which provides an estimator of local\nerror. The training process yields remarkably sharp partitions of input space\nbased upon correlation of function values. This classification of training\npoints is amenable to a hierarchical refinement strategy that significantly\nimproves the localization of the regression, allowing for higher-order\npolynomial approximation to be utilized. The framework scales more favorably to\nlarge data sets as compared to Gaussian process regression and allows for\nspatially varying uncertainty, leveraging the expressive power of deep neural\nnetworks while bypassing expensive training associated with other probabilistic\ndeep learning methods. Compared to standard deep neural networks, the framework\ndemonstrates hp-convergence without the use of regularizers to tune the\nlocalization of partitions.

    "abstract": "In this paper, a family of novel diffusion adaptive estimation algorithm is\nproposed from the asymmetric cost function perspective by combining diffusion\nstrategy and the linear-linear cost (LLC), quadratic-quadratic cost (QQC), and\nlinear-exponential cost (LEC), at all distributed network nodes, and named\ndiffusion LLCLMS (DLLCLMS), diffusion QQCLMS (DQQCLMS), and diffusion LECLMS\n(DLECLMS), respectively. Then the stability of mean estimation error and\ncomputational complexity of those three diffusion algorithms are analyzed\ntheoretically. Finally, several experiment simulation results are designed to\nverify the superiority of those three proposed diffusion algorithms.\nExperimental simulation results show that DLLCLMS, DQQCLMS, and DLECLMS\nalgorithms are more robust to the input signal and impulsive noise than the\nDSELMS, DRVSSLMS, and DLLAD algorithms. In brief, theoretical analysis and\nexperiment results show that those proposed DLLCLMS, DQQCLMS, and DLECLMS\nalgorithms have superior performance when estimating the unknown linear system\nunder the changeable impulsive noise environments and different types of input\nsignals.",

However, due to\ntheir sparse occurrence in the image, until now Stixels seldomly served as\ninput for Deep Learning algorithms, restricting their utility for such\napproaches. In this work we present StixelPointNet, a novel method to perform\nfast instance segmentation directly on Stixels. By regarding the Stixel\nrepresentation as unstructured data similar to point clouds, architectures like\nPointNet are able to learn features from Stixels. We use a bounding box\ndetector to propose candidate instances, for which the relevant Stixels are\nextracted from the input image. On these Stixels, a PointNet models learns\nbinary segmentations, which we then unify throughout the whole image in a final\nselection step. StixelPointNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on\nStixel-level, is considerably faster than pixel-based segmentation methods, and\nshows that with our approach the Stixel domain can be introduced to many new 3D\nDeep Learning tasks.",

    "abstract": "Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) can supplement the information from\ntheir own sensors with information from surrounding CAVs for decision making\nand control. This has the potential to improve traffic efficiency. CAVs face\nadditional challenges in their driving, however, when they interact with\nhuman-driven vehicles (HDVs) in mixed-traffic environments due to the\nuncertainty in human's driving behavior e.g. larger reaction times, perception\nerrors, etc. While a lot of research has investigated the impact of CAVs on\ntraffic safety and efficiency at different penetration rates, all have assumed\neither perfect communication or very simple scenarios with imperfect\ncommunication. In practice, the presence of communication delays and packet\nlosses means that CAVs might receive only partial information from surrounding\nvehicles, and this can have detrimental effects on their performance. This\npaper investigates the impact of CAVs on traffic efficiency in realistic\ncommunication and road network scenarios (i.e. imperfect communication and\nlarge-scale road network). We analyze the effect of unreliable communication\nlinks on CAVs operation in mixed traffic with various penetration rates and\nevaluate traffic performance in congested traffic scenarios on a large-scale\nroad network (the M50 motorway, in Ireland). Results show that CAVs can\nsignificantly improve traffic efficiency in congested traffic scenarios at high\npenetration rates. The scale of the improvement depends on communication\nreliability, with a packet drop rate of 70% leading to an increase in traffic\ncongestion by 28.7% and 11.88% at 40% and 70% penetration rates respectively\ncompared to perfect communication.",

    "abstract": "We study wireless networks where signal propagation delays are multiples of a\ntime interval. Such a network can be modelled as a weighted hypergraph. The\nlink scheduling problem of such a wireless network is closely related to the\nindependent sets of the periodic hypergraph induced by the weighted hypergraph.\nAs the periodic graph has infinitely many vertices, existing characterizations\nof graph independent sets cannot be applied to study link scheduling\nefficiently. To characterize the rate region of link scheduling, a directed\ngraph of finite size called scheduling graph is derived to capture a certain\nconditional independence property of link scheduling over time. A\ncollision-free schedule is equivalent to a path in the scheduling graph, and\nhence the rate region is equivalent to the convex hull of the rate vectors\nassociated with the cycles of the scheduling graph. With the maximum\nindependent set problem as a special case, calculating the whole rate region is\nNP hard and also hard to approximate. We derive two algorithms that benefit\nfrom a partial order on the paths in the scheduling graph, and can potentially\nfind schedules that are not dominated by the existing cycle enumerating\nalgorithms running in a given time. The first algorithm calculates the rate\nregion incrementally in the cycle lengths so that a subset of the rate region\ncorresponding to short cycles can be obtained efficiently. The second algorithm\nenumerates cycles associated with a maximal subgraph of the scheduling graph.\nIn addition to scheduling a wireless network, the independent sets of periodic\nhypergraphs also find applications in some operational research problems.",

    "abstract": "Channel capacity plays a crucial role in the development of modern\ncommunication systems as it represents the maximum rate at which information\ncan be reliably transmitted over a communication channel. Nevertheless, for the\nmajority of channels, finding a closed-form capacity expression remains an open\nchallenge. This is because it requires to carry out two formidable tasks a) the\ncomputation of the mutual information between the channel input and output, and\nb) its maximization with respect to the signal distribution at the channel\ninput. In this paper, we address both tasks. Inspired by implicit generative\nmodels, we propose a novel cooperative framework to automatically learn the\nchannel capacity, for any type of memory-less channel. In particular, we\nfirstly develop a new methodology to estimate the mutual information directly\nfrom a discriminator typically deployed to train adversarial networks, referred\nto as discriminative mutual information estimator (DIME). Secondly, we include\nthe discriminator in a cooperative channel capacity learning framework,\nreferred to as CORTICAL, where a discriminator learns to distinguish between\ndependent and independent channel input-output samples while a generator learns\nto produce the optimal channel input distribution for which the discriminator\nexhibits the best performance. Lastly, we prove that a particular choice of the\ncooperative value function solves the channel capacity estimation problem.\nSimulation results demonstrate that the proposed method offers high accuracy.",

In this work, we propose an effective weakly-supervised\nvideo semantic segmentation pipeline with click annotations, called WeClick,\nfor saving laborious annotating effort by segmenting an instance of the\nsemantic class with only a single click. Since detailed semantic information is\nnot captured by clicks, directly training with click labels leads to poor\nsegmentation predictions. To mitigate this problem, we design a novel memory\nflow knowledge distillation strategy to exploit temporal information (named\nmemory flow) in abundant unlabeled video frames, by distilling the neighboring\npredictions to the target frame via estimated motion. Moreover, we adopt\nvanilla knowledge distillation for model compression. In this case, WeClick\nlearns compact video semantic segmentation models with the low-cost click\nannotations during the training phase yet achieves real-time and accurate\nmodels during the inference period.

Soft\nerrors on the AIoT processors particularly the deep learning accelerators\n(DLAs) with massive computing may cause substantial computing errors. These\ncomputing errors are difficult to be captured by the conventional training on\ngeneral purposed processors like CPUs and GPUs in a server. Applying the\noffline trained neural network models to the edge accelerators with errors\ndirectly may lead to considerable prediction accuracy loss.\nTo address the problem, we propose a remote retraining framework (R2F) for\nremote AIoT processors with computing errors. It takes the remote AIoT\nprocessor with soft errors in the training loop such that the on-site computing\nerrors can be learned with the application data on the server and the retrained\nmodels can be resilient to the soft errors. Meanwhile, we propose an optimized\npartial TMR strategy to enhance the retraining. According to our experiments,\nR2F enables elastic design trade-offs between the model accuracy and the\nperformance penalty. The top-5 model accuracy can be improved by 1.93%-13.73%\nwith 0%-200% performance penalty at high fault error rate. In addition, we\nnotice that the retraining requires massive data transmission and even\ndominates the training time, and propose a sparse increment compression\napproach for the data transmission optimization, which reduces the retraining\ntime by 38%-88% on average with negligible accuracy loss over a straightforward\nremote retraining.",

    "abstract": "Communication technologies like voice over IP operate under constrained\nreal-time conditions, with voice packets being subject to delays and losses\nfrom the network. In such cases, the packet loss concealment (PLC) algorithm\nreconstructs missing frames until a new real packet is received. Recently,\nautoregressive deep neural networks have been shown to surpass the quality of\nsignal processing methods for PLC, specially for long-term predictions beyond\n60 ms. In this work, we propose a non-autoregressive adversarial auto-encoder,\nnamed PLAAE, to perform real-time PLC in the waveform domain. PLAAE has a\ncausal convolutional structure, and it learns in an auto-encoder fashion to\nreconstruct signals with gaps, with the help of an adversarial loss. During\ninference, it is able to predict smooth and coherent continuations of such gaps\nin a single feed-forward step, as opposed to autoregressive models. Our\nevaluation highlights the superiority of PLAAE over two classic PLCs and two\ndeep autoregressive models in terms of spectral and intonation reconstruction,\nperceptual quality, and intelligibility.",

In this paper, we propose a\nnew network architecture which aggregates the channel and context\ninterdependence features from multi aspect based on Time Delay Neural Network\n(TDNN). Firstly, we use the SE-Res2Blocks as in ECAPA-TDNN to explicitly model\nthe channel interdependence to realize adaptive calibration of channel\nfeatures, and process local context features in a multi-scale way at a more\ngranular level compared with conventional TDNN-based methods. Secondly, we\nexplore to use the encoder structure of Transformer to model the global context\ninterdependence features at an utterance level which can capture better long\nterm temporal characteristics. Before the pooling layer, we aggregate the\noutputs of SE-Res2Blocks and Transformer encoder to leverage the complementary\nchannel and context interdependence features learned by themself respectively.\nFinally, instead of performing a single attentive statistics pooling, we also\nfind it beneficial to extend the pooling method in a multi-head way which can\ndiscriminate features from multiple aspect.

The multiple sources of the available databases raised several\nchallenges for facial recognition task. These challenges are usually addressed\nby Convolution Neural Network (CNN) architectures.

    "abstract": "We introduce a method for egocentric videoconferencing that enables\nhands-free video calls, for instance by people wearing smart glasses or other\nmixed-reality devices. Videoconferencing portrays valuable non-verbal\ncommunication and face expression cues, but usually requires a front-facing\ncamera. Using a frontal camera in a hands-free setting when a person is on the\nmove is impractical. Even holding a mobile phone camera in the front of the\nface while sitting for a long duration is not convenient. To overcome these\nissues, we propose a low-cost wearable egocentric camera setup that can be\nintegrated into smart glasses. Our goal is to mimic a classical video call, and\ntherefore, we transform the egocentric perspective of this camera into a front\nfacing video. To this end, we employ a conditional generative adversarial\nneural network that learns a transition from the highly distorted egocentric\nviews to frontal views common in videoconferencing. Our approach learns to\ntransfer expression details directly from the egocentric view without using a\ncomplex intermediate parametric expressions model, as it is used by related\nface reenactment methods. We successfully handle subtle expressions, not easily\ncaptured by parametric blendshape-based solutions, e.g., tongue movement, eye\nmovements, eye blinking, strong expressions and depth varying movements. To get\ncontrol over the rigid head movements in the target view, we condition the\ngenerator on synthetic renderings of a moving neutral face. This allows us to\nsynthesis results at different head poses. Our technique produces temporally\nsmooth video-realistic renderings in real-time using a video-to-video\ntranslation network in conjunction with a temporal discriminator. We\ndemonstrate the improved capabilities of our technique by comparing against\nrelated state-of-the art approaches.",

The objectives of this\npaper are twofold: (1) to develop a large human-annotated dataset of news in\nUrdu language for hierarchical text classification; and (2) to classify Urdu\nnews hierarchically using our proposed model based on LSTM mechanism named as\nHierarchical Multi-layer LSTMs (HMLSTM). Our model consists of two modules:\nText Representing Layer, for obtaining text representation in which we use\nWord2vec embedding to transform the words to vector and Urdu Hierarchical LSTM\nLayer (UHLSTML) an end-to-end fully connected deep LSTMs network to perform\nautomatic feature learning, we train one LSTM layer for each level of the class\nhierarchy.

On the contrary, it is more interesting\nto understand the properties of the model, which parts could be replaced to\nobtain better results. Such questions are unified under machine learning\ninterpretability questions, which could be considered one of the area's raising\ntopics. In the paper, we use multi-objective evolutionary optimization for\ncomposite data-driven model learning to obtain the algorithm's desired\nproperties. It means that whereas one of the apparent objectives is precision,\nthe other could be chosen as the complexity of the model, robustness, and many\nothers. The method application is shown on examples of multi-objective learning\nof composite models, differential equations, and closed-form algebraic\nexpressions are unified and form approach for model-agnostic learning of the\ninterpretable models.",

    "abstract": "Synchronisation of wireless inertial measurement units in human movement\nanalysis is often achieved using event-based synchronisation techniques.\nHowever, these techniques lack precise event generation and accuracy. An\ninaccurate synchronisation could lead to large errors in motion estimation and\nreconstruction and therefore wrong analysis outputs. We propose a novel\nevent-based synchronisation technique based on a magnetic field, which allows\nsub-sample accuracy. A setup featuring Shimmer3 inertial measurement units is\ndesigned to test the approach. The proposed technique shows to be able to\nsynchronise with a maximum offset of below 2.6~ms with sensors measuring at\n100~Hz. Also, the results indicate a reliable event generation and detection.\nThe investigated parameters suggest a required synchronisation time of eight\nseconds. Further research should investigate the temperature changes that the\nsensors are exposed to during human motion analysis and their influence on the\ninternal time measurement of the sensors. In addition, the approach should be\ntested using inertial measurement units from different manufacturers to\ninvestigate an identified constant offset in the accuracy measurements.",

    "title": "The Quantitative Collapse of Concurrent Games with Symmetry",
    "abstract": "We explore links between the thin concurrent games of Castellan, Clairambault\nand Winskel, and the weighted relational models of linear logic studied by\nLaird, Manzonetto, McCusker and Pagani. More precisely, we show that there is\nan interpretationpreserving \"collapse\" functor from the former to the latter.\nOn objects, the functor defines for each game a set of possible execution\nstates. Defining the action on morphisms is more subtle, and this is the main\ncontribution of the paper. Given a strategy and an execution state, our functor\nneeds to count the witnesses for this state within the strategy. Strategies in\nthin concurrent games describe non-linear behaviour explicitly, so in general\neach witness exists in countably many symmetric copies. The challenge is to\ndefine the right notion of witnesses, factoring out this infinity while\nmatching the weighted relational model. Understanding how witnesses compose is\nparticularly subtle and requires a delve into the combinatorics of witnesses\nand their symmetries. In its basic form, this functor connects thin concurrent\ngames and a relational model weighted by N $\\cup$ {+$\\infty$}. We will\nadditionally consider a generalised setting where both models are weighted by\nelements of an arbitrary continuous semiring; this covers the probabilistic\ncase, among others. Witnesses now additionally carry a value from the semiring,\nand our interpretation-preserving collapse functor extends to this setting.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we put forward a brand-new idea of masking the algebraic\nstructure of linear codes used in code-based cryptography. Specially, we\nintroduce the so-called semilinear transformations in coding theory, make a\nthorough study on their algebraic properties and then creatively apply them to\nthe construction of code-based cryptosystems. Note that $\\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$ can\nbe viewed as an $\\mathbb{F}_q$-linear space of dimension $m$, a semilinear\ntransformation $\\varphi$ is therefore defined to be an $\\mathbb{F}_q$-linear\ntransformation over $\\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$. Then we impose this transformation to a\nlinear code $\\mathcal{C}$ over $\\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$. Apparently\n$\\varphi(\\mathcal{C})$ forms an $\\mathbb{F}_q$-linear space, but generally does\nnot preserve the $\\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$-linearity according to our analysis.\nInspired by this observation, a new technique for masking the structure of\nlinear codes is developed in this paper. Meanwhile, we endow the secret code\nwith the so-called partial cyclic structure to make a reduction in public-key\nsize. Compared to some other code-based cryptosystems, our proposal admits a\nmuch more compact representation of public keys.

    "title": "Mitigating Generation Shifts for Generalized Zero-Shot Learning",
    "abstract": "Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) is the task of leveraging semantic\ninformation (e.g., attributes) to recognize the seen and unseen samples, where\nunseen classes are not observable during training. It is natural to derive\ngenerative models and hallucinate training samples for unseen classes based on\nthe knowledge learned from the seen samples. However, most of these models\nsuffer from the `generation shifts', where the synthesized samples may drift\nfrom the real distribution of unseen data. In this paper, we conduct an\nin-depth analysis on this issue and propose a novel Generation Shifts\nMitigating Flow (GSMFlow) framework, which is comprised of multiple conditional\naffine coupling layers for learning unseen data synthesis efficiently and\neffectively. In particular, we identify three potential problems that trigger\nthe generation shifts, i.e., semantic inconsistency, variance decay, and\nstructural permutation and address them respectively. First, to reinforce the\ncorrelations between the generated samples and the respective attributes, we\nexplicitly embed the semantic information into the transformations in each of\nthe coupling layers. Second, to recover the intrinsic variance of the\nsynthesized unseen features, we introduce a visual perturbation strategy to\ndiversify the intra-class variance of generated data and hereby help adjust the\ndecision boundary of the classifier. Third, to avoid structural permutation in\nthe semantic space, we propose a relative positioning strategy to manipulate\nthe attribute embeddings, guiding which to fully preserve the inter-class\ngeometric structure. Experimental results demonstrate that GSMFlow achieves\nstate-of-the-art recognition performance in both conventional and generalized\nzero-shot settings.

This paper presents a novel Foreground-Background Composition GAN\n(FBC-GAN) that performs image generation by generating foreground objects and\nbackground scenes concurrently and independently, followed by composing them\nwith style and geometrical consistency. With this explicit design, FBC-GAN can\ngenerate images with foregrounds and backgrounds that are mutually independent\nin contents, thus lifting the undesirably learned content correlation\nconstraint and achieving superior diversity. It also provides excellent\nflexibility by allowing the same foreground object with different background\nscenes, the same background scene with varying foreground objects, or the same\nforeground object and background scene with different object positions, sizes\nand poses.

    "abstract": "Nisan and Szegedy (CC 1994) showed that any Boolean function\n$f:\\{0,1\\}^n\\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}$ that depends on all its input variables, when\nrepresented as a real-valued multivariate polynomial $P(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)$, has\ndegree at least $\\log n - O(\\log \\log n)$. This was improved to a tight $(\\log\nn - O(1))$ bound by Chiarelli, Hatami and Saks (Combinatorica 2020). Similar\nstatements are also known for other Boolean function complexity measures such\nas Sensitivity (Simon (FCT 1983)), Quantum query complexity, and Approximate\ndegree (Ambainis and de Wolf (CC 2014)).\nIn this paper, we address this question for \\emph{Probabilistic degree}. The\nfunction $f$ has probabilistic degree at most $d$ if there is a random\nreal-valued polynomial of degree at most $d$ that agrees with $f$ at each input\nwith high probability. Our understanding of this complexity measure is\nsignificantly weaker than those above: for instance, we do not even know the\nprobabilistic degree of the OR function, the best-known bounds put it between\n$(\\log n)^{1/2-o(1)}$ and $O(\\log n)$ (Beigel, Reingold, Spielman (STOC 1991);\nTarui (TCS 1993); Harsha, Srinivasan (RSA 2019)).\nHere we can give a near-optimal understanding of the probabilistic degree of\n$n$-variate functions $f$, \\emph{modulo} our lack of understanding of the\nprobabilistic degree of OR. We show that if the probabilistic degree of OR is\n$(\\log n)^c$, then the minimum possible probabilistic degree of such an $f$ is\nat least $(\\log n)^{c/(c+1)-o(1)}$, and we show this is tight up to $(\\log\nn)^{o(1)}$ factors.",

Drivers for this growth include recent legislative changes and\nincreased investments by industry and governments, along with increased concern\nfrom the general public. People are affected by autonomous decisions every day\nand the public need to understand the decision-making process to accept the\noutcomes.

Our\nentire system consists of three hardware components, two interactive\nfunctions~(obstacle avoidance and object finding) and a voice user interface.\nBased on voice guidance, the point cloud from the most recent state of the\nchanging indoor environment is captured through an on-site scanning performed\nby the user.

Hence, This study first offers a pipeline for\ngenerating labelled dataset of urban trees using Google Map's aerial images and\nthen investigates how state of the art deep Convolutional Neural Network models\nsuch as VGG and ResNet handle the classification problem of urban tree aerial\nimages under different parameters. Experimental results show our best model\nachieves an average accuracy of 60% over 6 tree species.",

    "abstract": "Inverse reinforcement learning is a paradigm motivated by the goal of\nlearning general reward functions from demonstrated behaviours. Yet the notion\nof generality for learnt costs is often evaluated in terms of robustness to\nvarious spatial perturbations only, assuming deployment at fixed speeds of\nexecution. However, this is impractical in the context of robotics and building\ntime-invariant solutions is of crucial importance. In this work, we propose a\nformulation that allows us to 1) vary the length of execution by learning\ntime-invariant costs, and 2) relax the temporal alignment requirements for\nlearning from demonstration. We apply our method to two different types of cost\nformulations and evaluate their performance in the context of learning reward\nfunctions for simulated placement and peg in hole tasks. Our results show that\nour approach enables learning temporally invariant rewards from misaligned\ndemonstration that can also generalise spatially to out of distribution tasks.",

While there exists a solid understanding of the conditions\nunder which cross-layer inferences are allowed from observations to\ninterventions, the results are somewhat scarcer when targeting counterfactual\nquantities. In this paper, we study the identification of nested\ncounterfactuals from an arbitrary combination of observations and experiments.\nSpecifically, building on a more explicit definition of nested counterfactuals,\nwe prove the counterfactual unnesting theorem (CUT), which allows one to map\narbitrary nested counterfactuals to unnested ones. For instance, applications\nin mediation and fairness analysis usually evoke notions of direct, indirect,\nand spurious effects, which naturally require nesting. Second, we introduce a\nsufficient and necessary graphical condition for counterfactual identification\nfrom an arbitrary combination of observational and experimental distributions.\nLastly, we develop an efficient and complete algorithm for identifying nested\ncounterfactuals; failure of the algorithm returning an expression for a query\nimplies it is not identifiable.",

In\naddition, we show the effective components by decomposing B-FARL, and we\nutilize the meta-learning framework for the B-FARL optimization.

Machine learning methods, specifically supervised learning is\ncommonly used in a variety of tasks formulated as semantic segmentation. One of\nthe major challenges in the supervised learning approaches is expressing and\ncollecting the rich knowledge that experts have with respect to the meaning\npresent in the image data. Towards this, typically a fixed set of labels is\nspecified and experts are tasked with annotating the pixels, patches or\nsegments in the images with the given labels. In general, however, the set of\nclasses does not fully capture the rich semantic information present in the\nimages.

In this\nwork, we develop a novel approach to collect segmentation annotations from\nexperts based on psychometric testing. Our method consists of the psychometric\ntesting procedure, active query selection, query enhancement, and a deep metric\nlearning model to achieve a patch-level image embedding that allows for\nsemantic segmentation of images.

    "abstract": "The performance of human pose estimation depends on the spatial accuracy of\nkeypoint localization. Most existing methods pursue the spatial accuracy\nthrough learning the high-resolution (HR) representation from input images. By\nthe experimental analysis, we find that the HR representation leads to a sharp\nincrease of computational cost, while the accuracy improvement remains marginal\ncompared with the low-resolution (LR) representation. In this paper, we propose\na design paradigm for cost-effective network with LR representation for\nefficient pose estimation, named FasterPose. Whereas the LR design largely\nshrinks the model complexity, yet how to effectively train the network with\nrespect to the spatial accuracy is a concomitant challenge. We study the\ntraining behavior of FasterPose, and formulate a novel regressive cross-entropy\n(RCE) loss function for accelerating the convergence and promoting the\naccuracy. The RCE loss generalizes the ordinary cross-entropy loss from the\nbinary supervision to a continuous range, thus the training of pose estimation\nnetwork is able to benefit from the sigmoid function. By doing so, the output\nheatmap can be inferred from the LR features without loss of spatial accuracy,\nwhile the computational cost and model size has been significantly reduced.\nCompared with the previously dominant network of pose estimation, our method\nreduces 58% of the FLOPs and simultaneously gains 1.3% improvement of accuracy.\nExtensive experiments show that FasterPose yields promising results on the\ncommon benchmarks, i.e., COCO and MPII, consistently validating the\neffectiveness and efficiency for practical utilization, especially the\nlow-latency and low-energy-budget applications in the non-GPU scenarios.",

Firstly, different methods are utilized to extract the features of\nthe image and the question for the two modalities of vision and text. Secondly,\nthis paper proposes a multi-view attention mechanism that include\nImage-to-Question (I2Q) attention and Word-to-Text (W2T) attention.

However, directly transferring KD from computer vision\nto medical image classification yields inferior performance as medical images\nsuffer from higher intra-class variance and class imbalance. To address these\nissues, we propose a novel Categorical Relation-preserving Contrastive\nKnowledge Distillation (CRCKD) algorithm, which takes the commonly used\nmean-teacher model as the supervisor.

With this\nregularization, the feature distribution of the student model shows higher\nintra-class similarity and inter-class variance. Besides, we propose a\nCategorical Relation Preserving (CRP) loss to distill the teacher's relational\nknowledge in a robust and class-balanced manner.

We also consider the subclass of atomic nondeterministic\nautomata introduced by Brzozowski and Tamm. Given a deterministic automaton and\nanother one for the reversed language, computing small atomic acceptors is\nshown to be NP-complete with analogous certificates. Our complexity results\nemerge from an algebraic characterization of (sub)atomic acceptors in terms of\ndeterministic automata with semilattice structure, combined with an equivalence\nof categories leading to succinct representations.",

    "abstract": "The consequences of disruptions in railway traffic are the primary cause of\npassengers' dissatisfaction. Hence, appropriate dispatching decisions are\nnecessary (e.g., by assigning the order of trains), given the numerous\nrestrictions of traffic nature. The latter is perceived as an NP-hard problem.\nThis paper outlines QUBO (quadratic unconstrained binary optimization) and HOBO\n(higher-order binary optimization) representations for dispatching problems of\nrailway traffic management. Specifically, we consider minimal span between\ntrains, minimal stay on stations, station/track occupation, and rolling stock\ncirculation. The main result is the hybrid algorithm to deal with disturbances\nin rail traffic on single-, double- and multi-track lines; the demonstrative\nmodel illustrates the issue briefly.

We argue that the standard concentration fails to fully\ncharacterize the intrinsic robustness of a classification problem, since it\nignores data labels which are essential to any classification task. Building on\na novel definition of label uncertainty, we empirically demonstrate that error\nregions induced by state-of-the-art models tend to have much higher label\nuncertainty compared with randomly-selected subsets. This observation motivates\nus to adapt a concentration estimation algorithm to account for label\nuncertainty, resulting in more accurate intrinsic robustness measures for\nbenchmark image classification problems.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new dynamic IRS beamforming framework to boost\nthe sum throughput of an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided wireless\npowered communication network (WPCN). Specifically, the IRS phase-shift vectors\nacross time and resource allocation are jointly optimized to enhance the\nefficiencies of both downlink wireless power transfer (DL WPT) and uplink\nwireless information transmission (UL WIT) between a hybrid access point (HAP)\nand multiple wirelessly powered devices. To this end, we first study three\nspecial cases of the dynamic IRS beamforming,namely user-adaptive IRS\nbeamforming, UL-adaptive IRS beamforming, and static IRS beamforming,by\ncharacterizing their optimal performance relationships and proposing\ncorresponding algorithms. Interestingly, it is rigorously proved that the\nlatter two cases achieve the same throughput, thus helping halve the number of\nIRS phase shifts to be optimized and signalling overhead practically required\nfor UL-adaptive IRS beamforming. Then, we propose a general optimization\nframework for dynamic IRS beamforming, which is applicable for any given number\nof IRS phase-shift vectors available. Despite of the non-convexity of the\ngeneral problem with highly coupled optimization variables, we propose two\nalgorithms to solve it and particularly, the low-complexity algorithm exploits\nthe intrinsic structure of the optimal solution as well as the solutions to the\ncases with user-adaptive and static IRS beamforming. Simulation results\nvalidate our theoretical findings, illustrate the practical significance of IRS\nwith dynamic beamforming for spectral and energy efficient WPCNs, and\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed designs over various benchmark\nschemes.",

The agent interacts with the environment over\nepisodes, with each episode having different context distributions; this\nresults in the `best expert' changing across episodes.

The sum of the distances between syntactically related words\nhas been in the limelight for the past decades. Research on dependency\ndistances led to the formulation of the principle of dependency distance\nminimization whereby words in sentences are ordered so as to minimize that sum.\nNumerous random baselines have been defined to carry out related quantitative\nstudies on languages. The simplest random baseline is the expected value of the\nsum in unconstrained random permutations of the words in the sentence, namely\nwhen all the shufflings of the words of a sentence are allowed and equally\nlikely.

    "abstract": "The incompleteness of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) is a crucial issue affecting the\nquality of AI-based services. In the scholarly domain, KGs describing research\npublications typically lack important information, hindering our ability to\nanalyse and predict research dynamics. In recent years, link prediction\napproaches based on Knowledge Graph Embedding models became the first aid for\nthis issue. In this work, we present Trans4E, a novel embedding model that is\nparticularly fit for KGs which include N to M relations with N$\\gg$M. This is\ntypical for KGs that categorize a large number of entities (e.g., research\narticles, patents, persons) according to a relatively small set of categories.\nTrans4E was applied on two large-scale knowledge graphs, the Academia/Industry\nDynAmics (AIDA) and Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG), for completing the\ninformation about Fields of Study (e.g., 'neural networks', 'machine learning',\n'artificial intelligence'), and affiliation types (e.g., 'education',\n'company', 'government'), improving the scope and accuracy of the resulting\ndata. We evaluated our approach against alternative solutions on AIDA, MAG, and\nfour other benchmarks (FB15k, FB15k-237, WN18, and WN18RR). Trans4E outperforms\nthe other models when using low embedding dimensions and obtains competitive\nresults in high dimensions.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes a variational auto-encoder based non-autoregressive\ntext-to-speech (VAENAR-TTS) model. The autoregressive TTS (AR-TTS) models based\non the sequence-to-sequence architecture can generate high-quality speech, but\ntheir sequential decoding process can be time-consuming. Recently,\nnon-autoregressive TTS (NAR-TTS) models have been shown to be more efficient\nwith the parallel decoding process. However, these NAR-TTS models rely on\nphoneme-level durations to generate a hard alignment between the text and the\nspectrogram. Obtaining duration labels, either through forced alignment or\nknowledge distillation, is cumbersome. Furthermore, hard alignment based on\nphoneme expansion can degrade the naturalness of the synthesized speech. In\ncontrast, the proposed model of VAENAR-TTS is an end-to-end approach that does\nnot require phoneme-level durations. The VAENAR-TTS model does not contain\nrecurrent structures and is completely non-autoregressive in both the training\nand inference phases. Based on the VAE architecture, the alignment information\nis encoded in the latent variable, and attention-based soft alignment between\nthe text and the latent variable is used in the decoder to reconstruct the\nspectrogram. Experiments show that VAENAR-TTS achieves state-of-the-art\nsynthesis quality, while the synthesis speed is comparable with other NAR-TTS\nmodels.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning is an emerging decentralized machine learning paradigm\nthat allows a large number of clients to train a joint model without the need\nto share their private data. Participants instead only share ephemeral updates\nnecessary to train the model. To ensure the confidentiality of the client\nupdates, Federated Learning systems employ secure aggregation; clients encrypt\ntheir gradient updates, and only the aggregated model is revealed to the\nserver. Achieving this level of data protection, however, presents new\nchallenges to the robustness of Federated Learning, i.e., the ability to\ntolerate failures and attacks. Unfortunately, in this setting, a malicious\nclient can now easily exert influence on the model behavior without being\ndetected. As Federated Learning is being deployed in practice in a range of\nsensitive applications, its robustness is growing in importance. In this paper,\nwe take a step towards understanding and improving the robustness of secure\nFederated Learning. We start this paper with a systematic study that evaluates\nand analyzes existing attack vectors and discusses potential defenses and\nassesses their effectiveness. We then present RoFL, a secure Federated Learning\nsystem that improves robustness against malicious clients through input checks\non the encrypted model updates. RoFL extends Federated Learning's secure\naggregation protocol to allow expressing a variety of properties and\nconstraints on model updates using zero-knowledge proofs. To enable RoFL to\nscale to typical Federated Learning settings, we introduce several ML and\ncryptographic optimizations specific to Federated Learning. We implement and\nevaluate a prototype of RoFL and show that realistic ML models can be trained\nin a reasonable time while improving robustness.",

SoundStream relies on a model architecture composed by\na fully convolutional encoder/decoder network and a residual vector quantizer,\nwhich are trained jointly end-to-end. Training leverages recent advances in\ntext-to-speech and speech enhancement, which combine adversarial and\nreconstruction losses to allow the generation of high-quality audio content\nfrom quantized embeddings. By training with structured dropout applied to\nquantizer layers, a single model can operate across variable bitrates from\n3kbps to 18kbps, with a negligible quality loss when compared with models\ntrained at fixed bitrates. In addition, the model is amenable to a low latency\nimplementation, which supports streamable inference and runs in real time on a\nsmartphone CPU. In subjective evaluations using audio at 24kHz sampling rate,\nSoundStream at 3kbps outperforms Opus at 12kbps and approaches EVS at 9.6kbps.\nMoreover, we are able to perform joint compression and enhancement either at\nthe encoder or at the decoder side with no additional latency, which we\ndemonstrate through background noise suppression for speech.",

    "abstract": "Recent work has shown that the performance of machine learning models can\nvary substantially when models are evaluated on data drawn from a distribution\nthat is close to but different from the training distribution. As a result,\npredicting model performance on unseen distributions is an important challenge.\nOur work connects techniques from domain adaptation and predictive uncertainty\nliterature, and allows us to predict model accuracy on challenging unseen\ndistributions without access to labeled data. In the context of distribution\nshift, distributional distances are often used to adapt models and improve\ntheir performance on new domains, however accuracy estimation, or other forms\nof predictive uncertainty, are often neglected in these investigations. Through\ninvestigating a wide range of established distributional distances, such as\nFrechet distance or Maximum Mean Discrepancy, we determine that they fail to\ninduce reliable estimates of performance under distribution shift. On the other\nhand, we find that the difference of confidences (DoC) of a classifier's\npredictions successfully estimates the classifier's performance change over a\nvariety of shifts. We specifically investigate the distinction between\nsynthetic and natural distribution shifts and observe that despite its\nsimplicity DoC consistently outperforms other quantifications of distributional\ndifference. $DoC$ reduces predictive error by almost half ($46\\%$) on several\nrealistic and challenging distribution shifts, e.g., on the ImageNet-Vid-Robust\nand ImageNet-Rendition datasets.",

    "abstract": "Electrical energy consumption data accessibility for low voltage (LV) end\nusers is one of the pillars of smart grids. In some countries, despite the\npresence of smart meters (SMs), a fragmentary data availability hinders the\ncreation of post-metering value-added services and confines such innovative\nsolutions to the prototypal and experimental level. This article focuses on a\nspecific approach adopted in Italy by the national regulatory authority (NRA)\nand the distribution system operators (DSOs): SMs are enabled to convey data to\nLV end users through a power line communication (PLC) channel (chain 2) in near\nreal-time. This paper aims to describe the proof of concept that the channel\nunderwent and its subsequent validation (with performances nearing 99% success\nrate), as well as its deployment and the market of post-metering services\nenabled by chain 2 (e.g., customer awareness, scheduling and power modulation\nof smart appliances, participation in the electricity market, etc.).\nRecommendations and models for researchers and industry experts are provided.",

    "abstract": "Finding shortest paths in a given network (e.g., a computer network or a road\nnetwork) is a well-studied task with many applications. We consider this task\nunder the presence of an adversary, who can manipulate the network by\nperturbing its edge weights to gain an advantage over others. Specifically, we\nintroduce the Force Path Problem as follows. Given a network, the adversary's\ngoal is to make a specific path the shortest by adding weights to edges in the\nnetwork. The version of this problem in which the adversary can cut edges is\nNP-complete. However, we show that Force Path can be solved to within arbitrary\nnumerical precision in polynomial time. We propose the PATHPERTURB algorithm,\nwhich uses constraint generation to build a set of constraints that require\npaths other than the adversary's target to be sufficiently long. Across a\nhighly varied set of synthetic and real networks, we show that the optimal\nsolution often reduces the required perturbation budget by about half when\ncompared to a greedy baseline method.",

    "abstract": "Existing classification-based face recognition methods have achieved\nremarkable progress, introducing large margin into hypersphere manifold to\nlearn discriminative facial representations. However, the feature distribution\nis ignored. Poor feature distribution will wipe out the performance improvement\nbrought about by margin scheme. Recent studies focus on the unbalanced\ninter-class distribution and form a equidistributed feature representations by\npenalizing the angle between identity and its nearest neighbor. But the problem\nis more than that, we also found the anisotropy of intra-class distribution. In\nthis paper, we propose the `gradient-enhancing term' that concentrates on the\ndistribution characteristics within the class. This method, named IntraLoss,\nexplicitly performs gradient enhancement in the anisotropic region so that the\nintra-class distribution continues to shrink, resulting in isotropic and more\ncompact intra-class distribution and further margin between identities. The\nexperimental results on LFW, YTF and CFP-FP show that our outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods by gradient enhancement, demonstrating the superiority\nof our method. In addition, our method has intuitive geometric interpretation\nand can be easily combined with existing methods to solve the previously\nignored problems.",

    "title": "Mitigating Performance Saturation in Neural Marked Point Processes:  Architectures and Loss Functions",
    "abstract": "Attributed event sequences are commonly encountered in practice. A recent\nresearch line focuses on incorporating neural networks with the statistical\nmodel -- marked point processes, which is the conventional tool for dealing\nwith attributed event sequences. Neural marked point processes possess good\ninterpretability of probabilistic models as well as the representational power\nof neural networks. However, we find that performance of neural marked point\nprocesses is not always increasing as the network architecture becomes more\ncomplicated and larger, which is what we call the performance saturation\nphenomenon. This is due to the fact that the generalization error of neural\nmarked point processes is determined by both the network representational\nability and the model specification at the same time. Therefore we can draw two\nmajor conclusions: first, simple network structures can perform no worse than\ncomplicated ones for some cases; second, using a proper probabilistic\nassumption is as equally, if not more, important as improving the complexity of\nthe network. Based on this observation, we propose a simple graph-based network\nstructure called GCHP, which utilizes only graph convolutional layers, thus it\ncan be easily accelerated by the parallel mechanism. We directly consider the\ndistribution of interarrival times instead of imposing a specific assumption on\nthe conditional intensity function, and propose to use a likelihood ratio loss\nwith a moment matching mechanism for optimization and model selection.\nExperimental results show that GCHP can significantly reduce training time and\nthe likelihood ratio loss with interarrival time probability assumptions can\ngreatly improve the model performance.",

    "abstract": "Efficiently approximating local curvature information of the loss function is\na key tool for optimization and compression of deep neural networks. Yet, most\nexisting methods to approximate second-order information have high\ncomputational or storage costs, which can limit their practicality. In this\nwork, we investigate matrix-free, linear-time approaches for estimating\nInverse-Hessian Vector Products (IHVPs) for the case when the Hessian can be\napproximated as a sum of rank-one matrices, as in the classic approximation of\nthe Hessian by the empirical Fisher matrix. We propose two new algorithms as\npart of a framework called M-FAC: the first algorithm is tailored towards\nnetwork compression and can compute the IHVP for dimension $d$, if the Hessian\nis given as a sum of $m$ rank-one matrices, using $O(dm^2)$ precomputation,\n$O(dm)$ cost for computing the IHVP, and query cost $O(m)$ for any single\nelement of the inverse Hessian. The second algorithm targets an optimization\nsetting, where we wish to compute the product between the inverse Hessian,\nestimated over a sliding window of optimization steps, and a given gradient\ndirection, as required for preconditioned SGD. We give an algorithm with cost\n$O(dm + m^2)$ for computing the IHVP and $O(dm + m^3)$ for adding or removing\nany gradient from the sliding window. These two algorithms yield\nstate-of-the-art results for network pruning and optimization with lower\ncomputational overhead relative to existing second-order methods.\nImplementations are available at [10] and [18].",

    "abstract": "We report on new stability conditions for evolutionary dynamics in the\ncontext of population games. We adhere to the prevailing framework consisting\nof many agents, grouped into populations, that interact noncooperatively by\nselecting strategies with a favorable payoff. Each agent is repeatedly allowed\nto revise its strategy at a rate referred to as revision rate. Previous\nstability results considered either that the payoff mechanism was a memoryless\npotential game, or allowed for dynamics (in the payoff mechanism) at the\nexpense of precluding any explicit dependence of the agents' revision rates on\ntheir current strategies. Allowing the dependence of revision rates on\nstrategies is relevant because the agents' strategies at any point in time are\ngenerally unequal. To allow for strategy-dependent revision rates and payoff\nmechanisms that are dynamic (or memoryless games that are not potential), we\nfocus on an evolutionary dynamics class obtained from a straightforward\nmodification of one that stems from the so-called impartial pairwise comparison\nstrategy revision protocol. Revision protocols consistent with the modified\nclass retain from those in the original one the advantage that the agents\noperate in a fully decentralized manner and with minimal information\nrequirements - they need to access only the payoff values (not the mechanism)\nof the available strategies. Our main results determine conditions under which\nsystem-theoretic passivity properties are assured, which we leverage for\nstability analysis.",

Our theoretical results indicate\nthat, for any sample size in the target domain, the proposed TLCp estimator\nperforms better than the Cp estimator by the mean squared error (MSE) metric in\nthe case of orthogonal predictors, provided that i) the dissimilarity between\nthe tasks from source domain and target domain is small, and ii) the procedure\nparameters (complexity penalties) are tuned according to certain explicit\nrules. Moreover, we show that our transfer learning framework can be extended\nto other feature selection criteria, such as the Bayesian information\ncriterion. By analyzing the solution of the orthogonalized Cp, we identify an\nestimator that asymptotically approximates the solution of the Cp criterion in\nthe case of non-orthogonal predictors.

An SA-ASR system\nusually consists of multiple modules such as speech separation, speaker\ndiarization and ASR.

In this paper, we present our recent study on the\ncomparison of such modular and joint approaches towards SA-ASR on real monaural\nrecordings. We develop state-of-the-art SA-ASR systems for both modular and\njoint approaches by leveraging large-scale training data, including 75 thousand\nhours of ASR training data and the VoxCeleb corpus for speaker representation\nlearning. We also propose a new pipeline that performs the E2E SA-ASR model\nafter speaker clustering. Our evaluation on the AMI meeting corpus reveals that\nafter fine-tuning with a small real data, the joint system performs 9.2--29.4%\nbetter in accuracy compared to the best modular system while the modular system\nperforms better before such fine-tuning. We also conduct various error analyses\nto show the remaining issues for the monaural SA-ASR.",

However, a key obstacle in the efficient implementation of DASGD\nis the issue of delays: when a computing node contributes a gradient update,\nthe global model parameter may have already been updated by other nodes several\ntimes over, thereby rendering this gradient information stale. These delays can\nquickly add up if the computational throughput of a node is saturated, so the\nconvergence of DASGD may be compromised in the presence of large delays. Our\nfirst contribution is that, by carefully tuning the algorithm's step-size,\nconvergence to the critical set is still achieved in mean square, even if the\ndelays grow unbounded at a polynomial rate. We also establish finer results in\na broad class of structured optimization problems (called variationally\ncoherent), where we show that DASGD converges to a global optimum with\nprobability $1$ under the same delay assumptions.

To address this, we propose an\nimage complexity-guided network compression technique for biomedical image\nsegmentation. Given any resource constraints, our framework utilizes data\ncomplexity and network architecture to quickly estimate a compressed model\nwhich does not require network training. Specifically, we map the dataset\ncomplexity to the target network accuracy degradation caused by compression.\nSuch mapping enables us to predict the final accuracy for different network\nsizes, based on the computed dataset complexity. Thus, one may choose a\nsolution that meets both the network size and segmentation accuracy\nrequirements.

Therefore, automated\ndiagnosis of CAD has indispensable significance in clinical medicine. However,\nthe complexity of coronary artery plaques that cause CAD makes the automatic\ndetection of coronary artery stenosis in Coronary CT angiography (CCTA) a\ndifficult task.

Given\na chemical reaction network, however, it is not at all straightforward to\nidentify species that are autocatalytic in the sense that there is a\nsub-network that takes $X$ as input and produces more than one copy of $X$ as\noutput. The difficulty arises from the need to distinguish autocatalysis e.g.\nfrom the superposition of a cycle that consumes and produces equal amounts of\n$X$ and a pathway that produces $X$. To deal with this issue, a number of\ncompeting notions, such as exclusive autocatalysis and autocatalytic cycles,\nhave been introduced. A closer inspection of concepts and their usage by\ndifferent authors shows, however, that subtle differences in the definitions\noften makes conceptually matching ideas difficult to bring together formally.\nIn this contribution we make some of the available approaches comparable by\ntranslating them into a common formal framework that uses integer hyperflows as\na basis to study autocatalysis in large chemical reaction networks. As an\napplication we investigate the prevalence of autocatalysis in metabolic\nnetworks.",

At each\niteration, the function and the gradient are approximated by sampling. The\nsample size in gradient approximations is smaller than the sample size in\nfunction approximations and the latter is determined using a deterministic rule\ninspired by the inexact restoration method, which allows the decrease of the\nsample size at some iterations. The trust-region step is then either accepted\nor rejected using a suitable merit function, which combines the function\nestimate with a measure of accuracy in the evaluation. We show that the\nproposed method eventually reaches full precision in evaluating the objective\nfunction and we provide a worst-case complexity result on the number of\niterations required to achieve full precision.

    "abstract": "Gaussian process (GP) model based optimization is widely applied in\nsimulation and machine learning. In general, it first estimates a GP model\nbased on a few observations from the true response and then employs this model\nto guide the search, aiming to quickly locate the global optimum. Despite its\nsuccessful applications, it has several limitations that may hinder its broader\nusage. First, building an accurate GP model can be difficult and\ncomputationally expensive, especially when the response function is multi-modal\nor varies significantly over the design space. Second, even with an appropriate\nmodel, the search process can be trapped in suboptimal regions before moving to\nthe global optimum due to the excessive effort spent around the current best\nsolution. In this work, we adopt the Additive Global and Local GP (AGLGP) model\nin the optimization framework. The model is rooted in the inducing-points-based\nGP sparse approximations and is combined with independent local models in\ndifferent regions. With these properties, the AGLGP model is suitable for\nmulti-modal responses with relatively large data sizes. Based on this AGLGP\nmodel, we propose a Combined Global and Local search for Optimization (CGLO)\nalgorithm. It first divides the whole design space into disjoint local regions\nand identifies a promising region with the global model. Next, a local model in\nthe selected region is fit to guide detailed search within this region. The\nalgorithm then switches back to the global step when a good local solution is\nfound. The global and local natures of CGLO enable it to enjoy the benefits of\nboth global and local search to efficiently locate the global optimum.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, Quantum Computing witnessed massive improvements both in\nterms of resources availability and algorithms development. The ability to\nharness quantum phenomena to solve computational problems is a long-standing\ndream that has drawn the scientific community's interest since the late '80s.\nIn such a context, we pose our contribution. First, we introduce basic concepts\nrelated to quantum computations, and then we explain the core functionalities\nof technologies that implement the Gate Model and Adiabatic Quantum Computing\nparadigms. Finally, we gather, compare and analyze the current state-of-the-art\nconcerning Quantum Perceptrons and Quantum Neural Networks implementations.",

    "title": "An algorithmic view of $\\ell_2$ regularization and some path-following  algorithms",
    "abstract": "We establish an equivalence between the $\\ell_2$-regularized solution path\nfor a convex loss function, and the solution of an ordinary differentiable\nequation (ODE). Importantly, this equivalence reveals that the solution path\ncan be viewed as the flow of a hybrid of gradient descent and Newton method\napplying to the empirical loss, which is similar to a widely used optimization\ntechnique called trust region method. This provides an interesting algorithmic\nview of $\\ell_2$ regularization, and is in contrast to the conventional view\nthat the $\\ell_2$ regularization solution path is similar to the gradient flow\nof the empirical loss.New path-following algorithms based on homotopy methods\nand numerical ODE solvers are proposed to numerically approximate the solution\npath. In particular, we consider respectively Newton method and gradient\ndescent method as the basis algorithm for the homotopy method, and establish\ntheir approximation error rates over the solution path. Importantly, our theory\nsuggests novel schemes to choose grid points that guarantee an arbitrarily\nsmall suboptimality for the solution path. In terms of computational cost, we\nprove that in order to achieve an $\\epsilon$-suboptimality for the entire\nsolution path, the number of Newton steps required for the Newton method is\n$\\mathcal O(\\epsilon^{-1/2})$, while the number of gradient steps required for\nthe gradient descent method is $\\mathcal O\\left(\\epsilon^{-1}\n\\ln(\\epsilon^{-1})\\right)$. Finally, we use $\\ell_2$-regularized logistic\nregression as an illustrating example to demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed path-following algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Brain tumor segmentation is a challenging problem in medical image analysis.\nThe endpoint is to generate the salient masks that accurately identify brain\ntumor regions in an fMRI screening. In this paper, we propose a novel attention\ngate (AG model) for brain tumor segmentation that utilizes both the edge\ndetecting unit and the attention gated network to highlight and segment the\nsalient regions from fMRI images. This feature enables us to eliminate the\nnecessity of having to explicitly point towards the damaged area(external\ntissue localization) and classify(classification) as per classical computer\nvision techniques. AGs can easily be integrated within the deep convolutional\nneural networks(CNNs). Minimal computional overhead is required while the AGs\nincrease the sensitivity scores significantly. We show that the edge detector\nalong with an attention gated mechanism provide a sufficient enough method for\nbrain segmentation reaching an IOU of 0.78",

    "abstract": "Super-resolution is an innovative technique that upscales the resolution of\nan image or a video and thus enables us to reconstruct high-fidelity images\nfrom low-resolution data. This study performs super-resolution analysis on\nturbulent flow fields spatially and temporally using various state-of-the-art\nmachine learning techniques like ESPCN, ESRGAN and TecoGAN to reconstruct\nhigh-resolution flow fields from low-resolution flow field data, especially\nkeeping in mind the need for low resource consumption and rapid results\nproduction/verification. The dataset used for this study is extracted from the\n'isotropic 1024 coarse' dataset which is a part of Johns Hopkins Turbulence\nDatabases (JHTDB). We have utilized pre-trained models and fine tuned them to\nour needs, so as to minimize the computational resources and the time required\nfor the implementation of the super-resolution models. The advantages presented\nby this method far exceed the expectations and the outcomes of regular single\nstructure models. The results obtained through these models are then compared\nusing MSE, PSNR, SAM, VIF and SCC metrics in order to evaluate the upscaled\nresults, find the balance between computational power and output quality, and\nthen identify the most accurate and efficient model for spatial and temporal\nsuper-resolution of turbulent flow fields.",
