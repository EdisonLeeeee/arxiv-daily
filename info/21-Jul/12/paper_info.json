    "abstract": "Stuttering is a speech disorder during which the flow of speech is\ninterrupted by involuntary pauses and repetition of sounds. Stuttering\nidentification is an interesting interdisciplinary domain research problem\nwhich involves pathology, psychology, acoustics, and signal processing that\nmakes it hard and complicated to detect. Recent developments in machine and\ndeep learning have dramatically revolutionized speech domain, however minimal\nattention has been given to stuttering identification. This work fills the gap\nby trying to bring researchers together from interdisciplinary fields. In this\npaper, we review comprehensively acoustic features, statistical and deep\nlearning based stuttering/disfluency classification methods. We also present\nseveral challenges and possible future directions.",

The\nequations of poroelasticity offer significant challenges in both areas, due to\nthe potentially strong coupling between unknowns in the system, saddle-point\nstructure, and the need to account for wide ranges of parameter values,\nincluding limiting behavior such as incompressible elasticity. This paper was\nmotivated by an attempt to develop monolithic multigrid preconditioners for the\ndiscretization developed in [48]; we show here why this is a difficult task\nand, as a result, we modify the discretization in [48] through the use of a\nreduced quadrature approximation, yielding a more \"solver-friendly\"\ndiscretization. Local Fourier analysis is used to optimize parameters in the\nresulting monolithic multigrid method, allowing a fair comparison between the\nperformance and costs of methods based on Vanka and Braess-Sarazin relaxation.\nNumerical results are presented to validate the LFA predictions and demonstrate\nefficiency of the algorithms.

    "abstract": "Gaussian processes with derivative information are useful in many settings\nwhere derivative information is available, including numerous Bayesian\noptimization and regression tasks that arise in the natural sciences.\nIncorporating derivative observations, however, comes with a dominating\n$O(N^3D^3)$ computational cost when training on $N$ points in $D$ input\ndimensions. This is intractable for even moderately sized problems. While\nrecent work has addressed this intractability in the low-$D$ setting, the\nhigh-$N$, high-$D$ setting is still unexplored and of great value, particularly\nas machine learning problems increasingly become high dimensional. In this\npaper, we introduce methods to achieve fully scalable Gaussian process\nregression with derivatives using variational inference. Analogous to the use\nof inducing values to sparsify the labels of a training set, we introduce the\nconcept of inducing directional derivatives to sparsify the partial derivative\ninformation of a training set. This enables us to construct a variational\nposterior that incorporates derivative information but whose size depends\nneither on the full dataset size $N$ nor the full dimensionality $D$. We\ndemonstrate the full scalability of our approach on a variety of tasks, ranging\nfrom a high dimensional stellarator fusion regression task to training graph\nconvolutional neural networks on Pubmed using Bayesian optimization.\nSurprisingly, we find that our approach can improve regression performance even\nin settings where only label data is available.",

    "abstract": "We propose a distributed control algorithm for a multi-agent network whose\nagents deploy over a cluttered region in accordance with a time-varying\ncoverage density function while avoiding collisions with all obstacles they\nencounter. Our algorithm is built on a two-level characterization of the\nnetwork. The first level treats the multi-agent network as a whole based on the\ndistribution of the locations of its agents over the spatial domain. In the\nsecond level, the network is described in terms of the individual positions of\nits agents. The aim of the multi-agent network is to attain a spatial\ndistribution that resembles that of a reference coverage density function\n(high-level problem) by means of local (microscopic) interactions of its agents\n(low-level problem). In addition, as the agents deploy, they must avoid\ncollisions with all the obstacles in the region at all times. Our approach\nutilizes a modified version of Voronoi tessellations which are comprised of\nwhat we refer to as Obstacle-Aware Voronoi Cells (OAVC) in order to enable\ncoverage control while ensuring obstacle avoidance. We consider two control\nproblems. The first problem which we refer to as the high-level coverage\ncontrol problem corresponds to an interpolation problem in the class of\nGaussian mixtures (no collision avoidance requirement), which we solve\nanalytically. The second problem which we refer to as the low-level coverage\ncontrol problem corresponds to a distributed control problem (collision\navoidance requirement is now enforced at all times) which is solved by\nutilizing Lloyd's algorithm together with the modified Voronoi tessellation\n(OAVC) and a time-varying coverage density function which corresponds to the\nsolution of the high-level coverage control problem.

    "abstract": "In general, finite concurrent two-player reachability games are only\ndetermined in a weak sense: the supremum probability to win can be approached\nvia stochastic strategies, but cannot be realized.\nWe introduce a class of concurrent games that are determined in a much\nstronger sense, and in a way, it is the larger class with this property. To\nthis end, we introduce the notion of \\emph{local interaction} at a state of a\ngraph game: it is a \\emph{game form} whose outcomes (i.e. a table whose\nentries) are the next states, which depend on the concurrent actions of the\nplayers. By definition, a game form is \\emph{determined} iff it always yields\ngames that are determined via deterministic strategies when used as a local\ninteraction in a Nature-free, one-shot reachability game. We show that if all\nthe local interactions of a graph game with Borel objective are determined game\nforms, the game itself is determined: if Nature does not play, one player has a\nwinning strategy; if Nature plays, both players have deterministic strategies\nthat maximize the probability to win. This constitutes a clear-cut separation:\neither a game form behaves poorly already when used alone with basic\nobjectives, or it behaves well even when used together with other well-behaved\ngame forms and complex objectives.\nExisting results for positional and finite-memory determinacy in turn-based\ngames are extended this way to concurrent games with determined local\ninteractions (CG-DLI).",

Our explanations are naturally robust to\nnoise because they are produced from the common decision boundaries of a GNN\nthat govern the predictions of many similar input graphs.

    "abstract": "Renewable-dominant power systems explore options to procure virtual inertia\nservices from non-synchronous resources (e.g., batteries, wind turbines) in\naddition to inertia traditionally provided by synchronous resources (e.g.,\nthermal generators). This paper designs a stochastic electricity market that\nproduces co-optimized and efficient prices for energy, reserve and inertia. We\nformulate a convex chance-constrained stochastic unit commitment model with\ninertia requirements and obtain equilibrium energy, reserve and inertia prices\nusing convex duality.

    "abstract": "Outdoor `living lab' experimentation using pervasive computing provides new\nopportunities: higher realism, external validity and large-scale\nsocio-spatio-temporal observations. However, experimentation `in the wild' is\nhighly complex and costly.

Novel geolocated survey\nand sensor data are collected subject of participants verifying desired\nexperimental conditions, for instance. their presence at certain urban spots.\nThis new approach drastically improves the quality and purposefulness of crowd\nsensing, tailored to conditions that confirm/reject hypotheses.

    "abstract": "In finite element calculations, the integral forms are usually evaluated\nusing nested loops over elements, and over quadrature points. Many such forms\n(e.g. linear or multi-linear) can be expressed in a compact way, without the\nexplicit loops, using a single tensor contraction expression by employing the\nEinstein summation convention. To automate this process and leverage existing\nhigh performance codes, we first introduce a notation allowing trivial\ndifferentiation of multi-linear finite element forms. Based on that we propose\nand describe a new transpiler from Einstein summation based expressions,\naugmented to allow defining multi-linear finite element weak forms, to regular\ntensor contraction expressions. The resulting expressions are compatible with a\nnumber of Python scientific computing packages, that implement, optimize and in\nsome cases parallelize the general tensor contractions. We assess the\nperformance of those packages, as well as the influence of operand memory\nlayouts and tensor contraction paths optimizations on the elapsed time and\nmemory requirements of the finite element form evaluations. We also compare the\nefficiency of the transpiled weak form implementations to the C-based functions\navailable in the finite element package SfePy.",

Due\nto the limitations of camera hardware, camera pose, limited bandwidth, varying\nillumination conditions, and occlusions, the quality of the surveillance feed\nis significantly degraded at times, thereby compromising monitoring of\nbehavior, activities, and other sporadic information in the scene. For the\nproposed research work, we have inspected the effectiveness of four\nconventional yet effective SR algorithms and three deep learning-based SR\nalgorithms to seek the finest method that executes well in a surveillance\nenvironment with limited training data op-tions. These algorithms generate an\nenhanced resolution output image from a sin-gle low-resolution (LR) input\nimage. For performance analysis, a subset of 220 images from six surveillance\ndatasets has been used, consisting of individuals with varying distances from\nthe camera, changing illumination conditions, and complex backgrounds. The\nperformance of these algorithms has been evaluated and compared using both\nqualitative and quantitative metrics. These SR algo-rithms have also been\ncompared based on face detection accuracy. By analyzing and comparing the\nperformance of all the algorithms, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based\nSR technique using an external dictionary proved to be best by achieving robust\nface detection accuracy and scoring optimal quantitative metric results under\ndifferent surveillance conditions.

    "abstract": "Circadian rhythm is the natural biological cycle manifested in human daily\nroutines. A regular and stable rhythm is found to be correlated with good\nphysical and mental health. With the wide adoption of mobile and wearable\ntechnology, many types of sensor data, such as GPS and actigraphy, provide\nevidence for researchers to objectively quantify the circadian rhythm of a user\nand further use these quantified metrics of circadian rhythm to infer the\nuser's health status. Researchers in computer science and psychology have\ninvestigated circadian rhythm using various mobile and wearable sensors in\necologically valid human sensing studies, but questions remain whether and how\ndifferent data types produce different circadian rhythm results when\nsimultaneously used to monitor a user. We hypothesize that different sensor\ndata reveal different aspects of the user's daily behavior, thus producing\ndifferent circadian rhythm patterns. In this paper we focus on two data types:\nGPS and accelerometer data from smartphones. We used smartphone data from 225\ncollege student participants and applied four circadian rhythm characterization\nmethods. We found significant and interesting discrepancies in the rhythmic\npatterns discovered among sensors, which suggests circadian rhythms discovered\nfrom different personal tracking sensors have different levels of sensitivity\nto device usage and aspects of daily behavior.",

Experimental\nresults showed that while leveraging hardware-specific acceleration achieved an\naverage inference speed-up of 380%, the degree of inference speed-up varied\ndrastically depending on the macro-architecture design pattern, with the\ngreatest speedup achieved on the depthwise bottleneck convolution design\npattern at 550%. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth exploration of the\ncorrelation between FLOPs requirement, level 3 cache efficacy, and network\nlatency with increasing architectural depth and width. Finally, we analyze the\ninference time reductions using hardware-specific acceleration when compared to\nnative deep learning frameworks across a wide variety of hand-crafted deep\nconvolutional neural network architecture designs as well as ones found via\nneural architecture search strategies. We found that the DARTS-derived\narchitecture to benefit from the greatest improvement from hardware-specific\nsoftware acceleration (1200%) while the depthwise bottleneck convolution-based\nMobileNet-V2 to have the lowest overall inference time of around 2.4 ms.",

    "abstract": "With the continuous growth of machine-type devices (MTDs), it is expected\nthat massive machine-type communication (mMTC) will be the dominant form of\ntraffic in future wireless networks. Applications based on this technology,\nhave fundamentally different traffic characteristics from human-to-human (H2H)\ncommunication, which involves a relatively small number of devices transmitting\nlarge packets consistently. Conversely, in mMTC applications, a very large\nnumber of MTDs transmit small packets sporadically. Therefore, conventional\ngrant-based access schemes commonly adopted for H2H service, are not suitable\nfor mMTC, as they incur in a large overhead associated with the channel request\nprocedure. We propose three grant-free distributed optimization architectures\nthat are able to significantly minimize the average power consumption of the\nnetwork. The problem of physical layer (PHY) and medium access control (MAC)\noptimization in grant-free random access transmission is is modeled as a\npartially observable stochastic game (POSG) aimed at minimizing the average\ntransmit power under a per-device delay constraint. The results show that the\nproposed architectures are able to achieve significantly less average latency\nthan a baseline, while spending less power. Moreover, the proposed\narchitectures are more robust than the baseline, as they present less variance\nin the performance for different system realizations.",

    "abstract": "Creating a domain model, even for classical, domain-independent planning, is\na notoriously hard knowledge-engineering task. A natural approach to solve this\nproblem is to learn a domain model from observations. However, model learning\napproaches frequently do not provide safety guarantees: the learned model may\nassume actions are applicable when they are not, and may incorrectly capture\nactions' effects. This may result in generating plans that will fail when\nexecuted. In some domains such failures are not acceptable, due to the cost of\nfailure or inability to replan online after failure. In such settings, all\nlearning must be done offline, based on some observations collected, e.g., by\nsome other agents or a human. Through this learning, the task is to generate a\nplan that is guaranteed to be successful. This is called the model-free\nplanning problem. Prior work proposed an algorithm for solving the model-free\nplanning problem in classical planning. However, they were limited to learning\ngrounded domains, and thus they could not scale. We generalize this prior work\nand propose the first safe model-free planning algorithm for lifted domains. We\nprove the correctness of our approach, and provide a statistical analysis\nshowing that the number of trajectories needed to solve future problems with\nhigh probability is linear in the potential size of the domain model. We also\npresent experiments on twelve IPC domains showing that our approach is able to\nlearn the real action model in all cases with at most two trajectories.",

In\nthis study, we propose a method that utilizes the association between seven\nbasic emotions and twelve action units from the AffWild2 dataset. The method\nbased on the architecture of ResNet50 involves the multi-task learning\ntechnique for the incomplete labels of the two tasks.

    "abstract": "This work addresses the problem of predicting the motion trajectories of\ndynamic objects in the environment. Recent advances in predicting motion\npatterns often rely on machine learning techniques to extrapolate motion\npatterns from observed trajectories, with no mechanism to directly incorporate\nknown rules. We propose a novel framework, which combines probabilistic\nlearning and constrained trajectory optimisation. The learning component of our\nframework provides a distribution over future motion trajectories conditioned\non observed past coordinates. This distribution is then used as a prior to a\nconstrained optimisation problem which enforces chance constraints on the\ntrajectory distribution. This results in constraint-compliant trajectory\ndistributions which closely resemble the prior. In particular, we focus our\ninvestigation on collision constraints, such that extrapolated future\ntrajectory distributions conform to the environment structure. We empirically\ndemonstrate on real-world and simulated datasets the ability of our framework\nto learn complex probabilistic motion trajectories for motion data, while\ndirectly enforcing constraints to improve generalisability, producing more\nrobust and higher quality trajectory distributions.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning practitioners often operate on a computational and monetary\nbudget. Thus, it is critical to design optimization algorithms that perform\nwell under any budget. The linear learning rate schedule is considered the best\nbudget-aware schedule, as it outperforms most other schedules in the low budget\nregime. On the other hand, learning rate schedules -- such as the\n\\texttt{30-60-90} step schedule -- are known to achieve high performance when\nthe model can be trained for many epochs. Yet, it is often not known a priori\nwhether one's budget will be large or small; thus, the optimal choice of\nlearning rate schedule is made on a case-by-case basis. In this paper, we frame\nthe learning rate schedule selection problem as a combination of $i)$ selecting\na profile (i.e., the continuous function that models the learning rate\nschedule), and $ii)$ choosing a sampling rate (i.e., how frequently the\nlearning rate is updated/sampled from this profile). We propose a novel profile\nand sampling rate combination called the Reflected Exponential (REX) schedule,\nwhich we evaluate across seven different experimental settings with both SGD\nand Adam optimizers. REX outperforms the linear schedule in the low budget\nregime, while matching or exceeding the performance of several state-of-the-art\nlearning rate schedules (linear, step, exponential, cosine, step decay on\nplateau, and OneCycle) in both high and low budget regimes. Furthermore, REX\nrequires no added computation, storage, or hyperparameters.",

Previous N-NMS efforts have primarily investigated\nshort-length block codes (N < 1000), because the number of N-NMS parameters to\nbe trained is proportional to the number of edges in the parity check matrix\nand the number of iterations, which imposes am impractical memory requirement\nwhen Pytorch or Tensorflow is used for training. This paper provides efficient\napproaches to training parameters of N-NMS that support N-NMS for longer block\nlengths. Specifically, this paper introduces a family of neural 2-dimensional\nnormalized (N-2D-NMS) decoders with with various reduced parameter sets and\nshows how performance varies with the parameter set selected. The N-2D-NMS\ndecoders share weights with respect to check node and/or variable node degree.\nSimulation results justify this approach, showing that the trained weights of\nN-NMS have a strong correlation to the check node degree, variable node degree,\nand iteration number. Further simulation results on the (3096,1032)\nprotograph-based raptor-like (PBRL) code show that N-2D-NMS decoder can achieve\nthe same FER as N-NMS with significantly fewer parameters required.

Mining and learning such systematic edit patterns (SEPs) from\npast code changes enable us to detect and repair overlooked buggy code that\nrequires systematic edits.\nA recent study presented a promising SEP mining technique that is based on\nprogram dependence graphs (PDGs), while traditional approaches leverage\nsyntax-based representations. PDG-based SEPs are highly expressive and can\ncapture more meaningful changes than syntax-based ones. The next challenge to\ntackle is to apply the same code changes as in PDG-based SEPs to other code\nlocations; detection and repair of overlooked locations that require systematic\nedits. Existing program transformation techniques cannot well address this\nchallenge because (1) they expect many structural code similarities that are\nnot guaranteed in PDG-based SEPs or (2) they work on the basis of PDGs but are\nlimited to specific domains (e.g., API migrations).\nWe present in this paper a general-purpose program transformation algorithm\nfor applying PDG-based SEPs. Our algorithm identifies a small transplantable\nstructural subtree for each PDG node, thereby adapting code changes from\nPDG-based SEPs to other locations. We construct a program repair pipeline\nSirius that incorporates the algorithm and automates the processes of mining\nSEPs, detecting overlooked code locations (bugs) that require systematic edits,\nand repairing them by applying SEPs.\nWe evaluated the repair performance of Sirius with a corpus of open source\nsoftware consisting of over 80 repositories. Sirius achieved a precision of\n0.710, recall of 0.565, and F1-score of 0.630, while those of the\nstate-of-the-art technique were 0.470, 0.141, and 0.216, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The progress in neuromorphic computing is fueled by the development of novel\nnonvolatile memories capable of storing analog information and implementing\nneural computation efficiently. However, like most other analog circuits, these\ndevices and circuits are prone to imperfections, such as temperature\ndependency, noise, tuning error, etc., often leading to considerable\nperformance degradation in neural network implementations. Indeed,\nimperfections are major obstacles in the path of further progress and ultimate\ncommercialization of these technologies. Hence, a practically viable approach\nshould be developed to deal with these nonidealities and unleash the full\npotential of nonvolatile memories in neuromorphic systems. Here, for the first\ntime, we report a comprehensive characterization of critical imperfections in\ntwo analog-grade memories, namely passively-integrated memristors and\nredesigned eFlash memories, which both feature long-term retention, high\nendurance, analog storage, low-power operation, and compact nano-scale\nfootprint. Then, we propose a holistic approach that includes modifications in\nthe training, tuning algorithm, memory state optimization, and circuit design\nto mitigate these imperfections. Our proposed methodology is corroborated on a\nhybrid software/experimental framework using two benchmarks: a moderate-size\nconvolutional neural network and ResNet-18 trained on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet\ndatasets, respectively. Our proposed approaches allow 2.5x to 9x improvements\nin the energy consumption of memory arrays during inference and sub-percent\naccuracy drop across 25-100 C temperature range. The defect tolerance is\nimproved by >100x, and a sub-percent accuracy drop is demonstrated in deep\nneural networks built with 64x64 passive memristive crossbars featuring 25%\nnormalized switching threshold variations.",

A compliant model of Cassie is\nrepresented as a hybrid system to set the stage for a trajectory optimization\nframework.

Control Lyapunov\nfunctions, which have strong theoretic guarantees, are synthesized to leverage\nthe gait library and coupled with inverse dynamics to obtain optimization-based\ncontrollers framed as quadratic programs. It is proven that this controller\nprovably achieves stable locomotion; this is coupled with a theoretic analysis\ndemonstrating useful properties of the controller for tuning and\nimplementation. The proposed theoretic framework is practically demonstrated on\nthe Cassie robot, wherein 3D walking is achieved through the use of\noptimization-based torque control.

    "abstract": "In recent years, multiparty computation as a service (MPCaaS) has gained\npopularity as a way to build distributed privacy-preserving systems. We argue\nthat for many such applications, we should also require that the MPC protocol\nis publicly auditable, meaning that anyone can check the given computation is\ncarried out correctly -- even if the server nodes carrying out the computation\nare all corrupt. In a nutshell, the way to make an MPC protocol auditable is to\ncombine an underlying MPC protocol with verifiable computing proof (in\nparticular, a SNARK). Building a general-purpose MPCaaS from existing\nconstructions would require us to perform a costly \"trusted setup\" every time\nwe wish to run a new or modified application. To address this, we provide the\nfirst efficient construction for auditable MPC that has a one-time universal\nsetup. Despite improving the trusted setup, we match the state-of-the-art in\nasymptotic performance: the server nodes incur a linear computation overhead\nand constant round communication overhead compared to the underlying MPC, and\nthe audit size and verification are logarithmic in the application circuit\nsize. We also provide an implementation and benchmarks that support our\nasymptotic analysis in example applications. Furthermore, compared with\nexisting auditable MPC protocols, besides offering a universal setup our\nconstruction also has a 3x smaller proof, 3x faster verification time and\ncomparable prover time.",

Given\nthe absence of a clear notion of ordering in the multicommodity case, we define\nthe generalized max flow as the feasible region of all flow values.\nWe define a collection of concepts and operations on flows and cuts in the\nmulticommodity setting. We study the mutual capacity of a set of cuts, defined\nas the set of flows that can pass through all cuts in the set. We present a\nmethod to calculate the mutual capacity of pairs of cuts, and then generalize\nthe same to a method of calculation for arbitrary sets of cuts.

    "abstract": "This paper studies the feasibility of deploying intelligent reflecting\nsurfaces (IRSs) in massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) systems to\nimprove the performance of users in the service dead zone. To reduce the\nchannel training overhead, we advocate a novel protocol for the uplink\ncommunication in the IRS-assisted massive MIMO systems. Under this protocol,\nthe IRS reflection coefficients are optimized based on the channel covariance\nmatrices, which are generally fixed for many coherence blocks, to boost the\nlong-term performance. Then, given the IRS reflecting coefficients, the BS\nbeamforming vectors are designed in each coherence block based on the effective\nchannel of each user, which is the superposition of its direct and reflected\nuser-IRS-BS channels, to improve the instantaneous performance. Since merely\nthe user effective channels are estimated in each coherence block, the training\noverhead of this protocol is the same as that in the legacy wireless systems\nwithout IRSs. Moreover, in the asymptotic regime that the numbers of IRS\nelements and BS antennas both go to infinity with a fixed ratio, we manage to\nfirst characterize the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimators of the user\neffective channels and then quantify the closed-form user achievable rates as\nfunctions of channel covariance matrices with channel training overhead and\nestimation error taken into account. Interestingly, it is shown that the\nproperties of channel hardening and favorable propagation still hold for the\nuser effective channels, and satisfactory user rates are thus achievable even\nif simple BS beamforming solutions, e.g., maximal-ratio combining, are\nemployed. Finally, thanks to the rate characterization, we design a\nlow-complexity algorithm to optimize the IRS reflection coefficients based on\nchannel covariance matrices.",

    "abstract": "Agent-based modelling is a powerful tool when simulating human systems, yet\nwhen human behaviour cannot be described by simple rules or maximising one's\nown profit, we quickly reach the limits of this methodology. Machine learning\nhas the potential to bridge this gap by providing a link between what people\nobserve and how they act in order to reach their goal. In this paper we use a\nframework for agent-based modelling that utilizes human values like fairness,\nconformity and altruism. Using this framework we simulate a public goods game\nand compare to experimental results. We can report good agreement between\nsimulation and experiment and furthermore find that the presented framework\noutperforms strict reinforcement learning. Both the framework and the utility\nfunction are generic enough that they can be used for arbitrary systems, which\nmakes this method a promising candidate for a foundation of a universal\nagent-based model.",

    "abstract": "Applying Federated Learning (FL) on Internet-of-Things devices is\nnecessitated by the large volumes of data they produce and growing concerns of\ndata privacy. However, there are three challenges that need to be addressed to\nmake FL efficient: (i) execute on devices with limited computational\ncapabilities, (ii) account for stragglers due to computational heterogeneity of\ndevices, and (iii) adapt to the changing network bandwidths. This paper\npresents FedAdapt, an adaptive offloading FL framework to mitigate the\naforementioned challenges. FedAdapt accelerates local training in\ncomputationally constrained devices by leveraging layer offloading of deep\nneural networks (DNNs) to servers. Further, FedAdapt adopts reinforcement\nlearning-based optimization and clustering to adaptively identify which layers\nof the DNN should be offloaded for each individual device on to a server to\ntackle the challenges of computational heterogeneity and changing network\nbandwidth. Experimental studies are carried out on a lab-based testbed\ncomprising five IoT devices. By offloading a DNN from the device to the server\nFedAdapt reduces the training time of a typical IoT device by over half\ncompared to classic FL. The training time of extreme stragglers and the overall\ntraining time can be reduced by up to 57%. Furthermore, with changing network\nbandwidth, FedAdapt is demonstrated to reduce the training time by up to 40%\nwhen compared to classic FL, without sacrificing accuracy. FedAdapt can be\ndownloaded from https://github.com/qub-blesson/FedAdapt.",

    "abstract": "Video object segmentation, aiming to segment the foreground objects given the\nannotation of the first frame, has been attracting increasing attentions. Many\nstate-of-the-art approaches have achieved great performance by relying on\nonline model updating or mask-propagation techniques. However, most online\nmodels require high computational cost due to model fine-tuning during\ninference. Most mask-propagation based models are faster but with relatively\nlow performance due to failure to adapt to object appearance variation. In this\npaper, we are aiming to design a new model to make a good balance between speed\nand performance. We propose a model, called NPMCA-net, which directly localizes\nforeground objects based on mask-propagation and non-local technique by\nmatching pixels in reference and target frames. Since we bring in information\nof both first and previous frames, our network is robust to large object\nappearance variation, and can better adapt to occlusions. Extensive experiments\nshow that our approach can achieve a new state-of-the-art performance with a\nfast speed at the same time (86.5% IoU on DAVIS-2016 and 72.2% IoU on\nDAVIS-2017, with speed of 0.11s per frame) under the same level comparison.\nSource code is available at https://github.com/siyueyu/NPMCA-net.",

    "abstract": "Image inpainting aims to restore the missing regions and make the recovery\nresults identical to the originally complete image, which is different from the\ncommon generative task emphasizing the naturalness of generated images.\nNevertheless, existing works usually regard it as a pure generation problem and\nemploy cutting-edge generative techniques to address it. The generative\nnetworks fill the main missing parts with realistic contents but usually\ndistort the local structures. In this paper, we formulate image inpainting as a\nmix of two problems, i.e., predictive filtering and deep generation. Predictive\nfiltering is good at preserving local structures and removing artifacts but\nfalls short to complete the large missing regions. The deep generative network\ncan fill the numerous missing pixels based on the understanding of the whole\nscene but hardly restores the details identical to the original ones. To make\nuse of their respective advantages, we propose the joint predictive filtering\nand generative network (JPGNet) that contains three branches: predictive\nfiltering & uncertainty network (PFUNet), deep generative network, and\nuncertainty-aware fusion network (UAFNet). The PFUNet can adaptively predict\npixel-wise kernels for filtering-based inpainting according to the input image\nand output an uncertainty map. This map indicates the pixels should be\nprocessed by filtering or generative networks, which is further fed to the\nUAFNet for a smart combination between filtering and generative results. Note\nthat, our method as a novel framework for the image inpainting problem can\nbenefit any existing generation-based methods. We validate our method on three\npublic datasets, i.e., Dunhuang, Places2, and CelebA, and demonstrate that our\nmethod can enhance three state-of-the-art generative methods (i.e., StructFlow,\nEdgeConnect, and RFRNet) significantly with the slightly extra time cost.",

    "abstract": "Widely deployed deep neural network (DNN) models have been proven to be\nvulnerable to adversarial perturbations in many applications (e.g., image,\naudio and text classifications). To date, there are only a few adversarial\nperturbations proposed to deviate the DNN models in video recognition systems\nby simply injecting 2D perturbations into video frames. However, such attacks\nmay overly perturb the videos without learning the spatio-temporal features\n(across temporal frames), which are commonly extracted by DNN models for video\nrecognition. To our best knowledge, we propose the first black-box attack\nframework that generates universal 3-dimensional (U3D) perturbations to subvert\na variety of video recognition systems. U3D has many advantages, such as (1) as\nthe transfer-based attack, U3D can universally attack multiple DNN models for\nvideo recognition without accessing to the target DNN model; (2) the high\ntransferability of U3D makes such universal black-box attack easy-to-launch,\nwhich can be further enhanced by integrating queries over the target model when\nnecessary; (3) U3D ensures human-imperceptibility; (4) U3D can bypass the\nexisting state-of-the-art defense schemes; (5) U3D can be efficiently generated\nwith a few pre-learned parameters, and then immediately injected to attack\nreal-time DNN-based video recognition systems.

The task is, for\ngiven $n$-bit substitution map $P_n: \\{0,1\\}^n \\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}^n$, to find\na sequence of reversible logic gates that implements the map. The gate library\nadopted in this work consists of multiple-controlled Toffoli gates denoted by\n$C^m\\!X$, where $m$ is the number of control bits that ranges from 0 to $n-1$.\nControlled gates with large $m \\,\\,(>2)$ are then further decomposed into\n$C^0\\!X$, $C^1\\!X$, and $C^2\\!X$ gates. A primary concern in designing the\nalgorithm is to reduce the use of $C^2\\!X$ gate (also known as Toffoli gate)\nwhich is known to be universal. The main idea is to view an $n$-bit\nsubstitution map as a rank-$2n$ tensor and to transform it such that the\nresulting map can be written as a tensor product of a rank-($2n-2$) tensor and\nthe $2\\times 2$ identity matrix. Let $\\mathcal{P}_n$ be a set of all $n$-bit\nsubstitution maps.

    "abstract": "Quantum annealing is an emerging new platform for combinatorial optimization,\nrequiring an Ising model formulation for optimization problems. The formulation\ncan be an essential obstacle to the permeation of this innovation into broad\nareas of everyday life. Our research is aimed at the proposal of a Petri net\nmodeling approach for an Ising model formulation. Although the proposed method\nrequires users to model their optimization problems with Petri nets, this\nprocess can be carried out in a relatively straightforward manner if we know\nthe target problem and the simple Petri net modeling rules. With our method,\nthe constraints and objective functions in the target optimization problems are\nrepresented as fundamental characteristics of Petri net models, extracted\nsystematically from Petri net models, and then converted into binary quadratic\nnets, equivalent to Ising models. The proposed method can drastically reduce\nthe difficulty of the Ising model formulation.",

    "abstract": "Recently, artificial neural networks have been gaining momentum in the field\nof gravitational wave astronomy, for example in surrogate modelling of\ncomputationally expensive waveform models for binary black hole inspiral and\nmerger. Surrogate modelling yields fast and accurate approximations of\ngravitational waves and neural networks have been used in the final step of\ninterpolating the coefficients of the surrogate model for arbitrary waveforms\noutside the training sample. We investigate the existence of underlying\nstructures in the empirical interpolation coefficients using autoencoders. We\ndemonstrate that when the coefficient space is compressed to only two\ndimensions, a spiral structure appears, wherein the spiral angle is linearly\nrelated to the mass ratio. Based on this finding, we design a spiral module\nwith learnable parameters, that is used as the first layer in a neural network,\nwhich learns to map the input space to the coefficients. The spiral module is\nevaluated on multiple neural network architectures and consistently achieves\nbetter speed-accuracy trade-off than baseline models. A thorough experimental\nstudy is conducted and the final result is a surrogate model which can evaluate\nmillions of input parameters in a single forward pass in under 1ms on a desktop\nGPU, while the mismatch between the corresponding generated waveforms and the\nground-truth waveforms is better than the compared baseline methods.

In excavation,\na bucket interacts with the surrounding soil in a highly nonlinear and complex\nmanner.

The space of\nindependent state variables is augmented by adding variables associated with\nnonlinear elements involved in the bucket-soil dynamics. These include\nnonlinear resistive forces and moment acting on the bucket from the soil, and\nthe effective inertia of the bucket that varies as the soil is captured into\nthe bucket. Variables associated with these nonlinear resistive and inertia\nelements are treated as additional state variables, and their time evolution is\nrepresented as another set of linear differential equations. The lifted linear\ndynamic model is then applied to Model Predictive Contouring Control, where a\ncost functional is minimized as a convex optimization problem thanks to the\nlinear dynamics in the lifted space. The lifted linear model is tuned based on\na data-driven method by using a soil dynamics simulator.

Multi-path framework (e.g. DARTS) is\nintuitive but suffers from memory usage and training collapse. Single-path\nmethods (e.g.GDAS and ProxylessNAS) mitigate the memory issue and shrink the\ngap between searching and evaluation but sacrifice the performance. In this\npaper, we propose a conceptually simple yet efficient method to bridge these\ntwo paradigms, referred as Mutually-aware Sub-Graphs Differentiable\nArchitecture Search (MSG-DAS). The core of our framework is a differentiable\nGumbel-TopK sampler that produces multiple mutually exclusive single-path\nsub-graphs. To alleviate the severer skip-connect issue brought by multiple\nsub-graphs setting, we propose a Dropblock-Identity module to stabilize the\noptimization. To make best use of the available models (super-net and\nsub-graphs), we introduce a memory-efficient super-net guidance distillation to\nimprove training.

    "abstract": "The construction of an ontology of scientific knowledge objects, presented\nhere, is part of the development of an approach oriented towards the\nvisualization of scientific knowledge. It is motivated by the fact that the\nconcepts of organization of scientific knowledge (theorem, law, experience,\nproof, etc.) appear in existing ontologies but that none of them is centered on\nthis topic and presents a simple and easily usable organization. We present the\nfirst version built from ontological sources (ontologies of knowledge objects\nof certain fields, lexical and higher level ones), specialized knowledge bases\nand interviews with scientists. We have aligned this ontology with some of the\nsources used, which has allowed us to verify its consistency with respect to\nthem. The validation of the ontology consists in using it to formalize\nknowledge from various sources, which we have begun to do in the field of\nphysics.",

    "title": "RGB Stream Is Enough for Temporal Action Detection",
    "abstract": "State-of-the-art temporal action detectors to date are based on two-stream\ninput including RGB frames and optical flow. Although combining RGB frames and\noptical flow boosts performance significantly, optical flow is a hand-designed\nrepresentation which not only requires heavy computation, but also makes it\nmethodologically unsatisfactory that two-stream methods are often not learned\nend-to-end jointly with the flow. In this paper, we argue that optical flow is\ndispensable in high-accuracy temporal action detection and image level data\naugmentation (ILDA) is the key solution to avoid performance degradation when\noptical flow is removed. To evaluate the effectiveness of ILDA, we design a\nsimple yet efficient one-stage temporal action detector based on single RGB\nstream named DaoTAD. Our results show that when trained with ILDA, DaoTAD has\ncomparable accuracy with all existing state-of-the-art two-stream detectors\nwhile surpassing the inference speed of previous methods by a large margin and\nthe inference speed is astounding 6668 fps on GeForce GTX 1080 Ti.

To accurately capture the\nlong-time evolution of the moving interfaces, we present a derivation of the\ncorresponding sharp-interface limit using matched asymptotic expansions, and\nshow that the limiting process leads to a Hele-Shaw type moving interface\nproblem. The numerical treatment of the sharp-interface limit is more\ncomplicated due to the stiffness of the equations. To address this problem, we\npresent a boundary integral formulation corresponding to a sharp interface\nlimit of the Ohta-Kawasaki model. Starting with the governing equations defined\non separate phase domains, we develop boundary integral equations valid for\nmulti-connected domains in a 2D plane. For numerical simplicity we assume our\nproblem is driven by a uniform Dirichlet condition on a circular far-field\nboundary. The integral formulation of the problem involves both double- and\nsingle-layer potentials due to the modified boundary condition. In particular,\nour formulation allows one to compute the nonlinear dynamics of a\nnon-equilibrium system and pattern formation of an equilibrating system.\nNumerical tests on an evolving slightly perturbed circular interface\n(separating the two phases) are in excellent agreement with the linear\nanalysis, demonstrating that the method is stable, efficient and spectrally\naccurate in space.",

    "abstract": "As technology scaling is approaching the physical limit, lithography hotspot\ndetection has become an essential task in design for manufacturability. While\nthe deployment of pattern matching or machine learning in hotspot detection can\nhelp save significant simulation time, such methods typically demand for\nnon-trivial quality data to build the model, which most design houses are short\nof. Moreover, the design houses are also unwilling to directly share such data\nwith the other houses to build a unified model, which can be ineffective for\nthe design house with unique design patterns due to data insufficiency. On the\nother hand, with data homogeneity in each design house, the locally trained\nmodels can be easily over-fitted, losing generalization ability and robustness.\nIn this paper, we propose a heterogeneous federated learning framework for\nlithography hotspot detection that can address the aforementioned issues. On\none hand, the framework can build a more robust centralized global sub-model\nthrough heterogeneous knowledge sharing while keeping local data private. On\nthe other hand, the global sub-model can be combined with a local sub-model to\nbetter adapt to local data heterogeneity. The experimental results show that\nthe proposed framework can overcome the challenge of non-independent and\nidentically distributed (non-IID) data and heterogeneous communication to\nachieve very high performance in comparison to other state-of-the-art methods\nwhile guaranteeing a good convergence rate in various scenarios.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of consensus-based distributed\noptimization where a network of agents, abstracted as a directed graph, aims to\nminimize the sum of all agents' cost functions collaboratively. In existing\ndistributed optimization approaches (Push-Pull/AB) for directed graphs, all\nagents exchange their states with neighbors to achieve the optimal solution\nwith a constant stepsize, which may lead to the disclosure of sensitive and\nprivate information. For privacy preservation, we propose a novel\nstate-decomposition based gradient tracking approach (SD-Push-Pull) for\ndistributed optimzation over directed networks that preserves differential\nprivacy, which is a strong notion that protects agents' privacy against an\nadversary with arbitrary auxiliary information. The main idea of the proposed\napproach is to decompose the gradient state of each agent into two sub-states.\nOnly one substate is exchanged by the agent with its neighbours over time, and\nthe other one is kept private. That is to say, only one substate is visible to\nan adversary, protecting the privacy from being leaked. It is proved that under\ncertain decomposition principles, a bound for the sub-optimality of the\nproposed algorithm can be derived and the differential privacy is achieved\nsimultaneously. Moreover, the trade-off between differential privacy and the\noptimization accuracy is also characterized. Finally, a numerical simulation is\nprovided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

To overcome these problems, unlike\nprevious works compressing layers separately, we propose to compress CNNs and\nalleviate performance degradation via joint matrix decomposition.

    "abstract": "We propose a model for games in which the players have shared access to a\nblockchain that allows them to deploy smart contracts to act on their behalf.\nThis changes fundamental game-theoretic assumptions about rationality since a\ncontract can commit a player to act irrationally in specific subgames, making\ncredible otherwise non-credible threats. This is further complicated by\nconsidering the interaction between multiple contracts which can reason about\neach other. This changes the nature of the game in a nontrivial way as choosing\nwhich contract to play can itself be considered a move in the game. Our model\ngeneralizes known notions of equilibria, with a single contract being\nequivalent to a Stackelberg equilibrium, and two contracts being equivalent to\na reverse Stackelberg equilibrium. We prove a number of bounds on the\ncomplexity of computing SPE in such games with smart contracts. We show that\ncomputing an SPE is $\\textsf{PSPACE}$-hard in the general case. Specifically,\nin games with $k$ contracts, we show that computing an SPE is\n$\\Sigma_k^\\textsf{P}$-hard for games of imperfect information. We show that\ncomputing an SPE remains $\\textsf{PSPACE}$-hard in games of perfect information\nif we allow for an unbounded number of contracts. We give an algorithm for\ncomputing an SPE in two-contract games of perfect information that runs in time\n$O(m\\ell)$ where $m$ is the size of the game tree and $\\ell$ is the number of\nterminal nodes. Finally, we conjecture the problem to be $\\textsf{NP}$-complete\nfor three contracts.",

Such methods are limited by image\nresolution due to which they fail to disambiguate structures in dense regions\nwhich appear commonly in forms. To mitigate this, we propose Form2Seq, a novel\nsequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) inspired framework for structure extraction\nusing text, with a specific focus on forms, which leverages relative spatial\narrangement of structures. We discuss two tasks; 1) Classification of low-level\nconstituent elements (TextBlock and empty fillable Widget) into ten types such\nas field captions, list items, and others; 2) Grouping lower-level elements\ninto higher-order constructs, such as Text Fields, ChoiceFields and\nChoiceGroups, used as information collection mechanism in forms.

    "abstract": "The process of aggregation is ubiquitous in almost all deep nets models. It\nfunctions as an important mechanism for consolidating deep features into a more\ncompact representation, whilst increasing robustness to overfitting and\nproviding spatial invariance in deep nets. In particular, the proximity of\nglobal aggregation layers to the output layers of DNNs mean that aggregated\nfeatures have a direct influence on the performance of a deep net. A better\nunderstanding of this relationship can be obtained using information theoretic\nmethods. However, this requires the knowledge of the distributions of the\nactivations of aggregation layers. To achieve this, we propose a novel\nmathematical formulation for analytically modelling the probability\ndistributions of output values of layers involved with deep feature\naggregation. An important outcome is our ability to analytically predict the\nKL-divergence of output nodes in a DNN. We also experimentally verify our\ntheoretical predictions against empirical observations across a range of\ndifferent classification tasks and datasets.",

    "title": "On the Challenges of Open World Recognitionunder Shifting Visual Domains",
    "abstract": "Robotic visual systems operating in the wild must act in unconstrained\nscenarios, under different environmental conditions while facing a variety of\nsemantic concepts, including unknown ones. To this end, recent works tried to\nempower visual object recognition methods with the capability to i) detect\nunseen concepts and ii) extended their knowledge over time, as images of new\nsemantic classes arrive. This setting, called Open World Recognition (OWR), has\nthe goal to produce systems capable of breaking the semantic limits present in\nthe initial training set. However, this training set imposes to the system not\nonly its own semantic limits, but also environmental ones, due to its bias\ntoward certain acquisition conditions that do not necessarily reflect the high\nvariability of the real-world. This discrepancy between training and test\ndistribution is called domain-shift. This work investigates whether OWR\nalgorithms are effective under domain-shift, presenting the first benchmark\nsetup for assessing fairly the performances of OWR algorithms, with and without\ndomain-shift. We then use this benchmark to conduct analyses in various\nscenarios, showing how existing OWR algorithms indeed suffer a severe\nperformance degradation when train and test distributions differ. Our analysis\nshows that this degradation is only slightly mitigated by coupling OWR with\ndomain generalization techniques, indicating that the mere plug-and-play of\nexisting algorithms is not enough to recognize new and unknown categories in\nunseen domains. Our results clearly point toward open issues and future\nresearch directions, that need to be investigated for building robot visual\nsystems able to function reliably under these challenging yet very real\nconditions.

    "abstract": "Sleep staging is of great importance in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep\ndisorders. Recently, numerous data driven deep learning models have been\nproposed for automatic sleep staging. They mainly rely on the assumption that\ntraining and testing data are drawn from the same distribution which may not\nhold in real-world scenarios. Unsupervised domain adaption (UDA) has been\nrecently developed to handle this domain shift problem. However, previous UDA\nmethods applied for sleep staging has two main limitations. First, they rely on\na totally shared model for the domain alignment, which may lose the\ndomain-specific information during feature extraction. Second, they only align\nthe source and target distributions globally without considering the class\ninformation in the target domain, which hinders the classification performance\nof the model. In this work, we propose a novel adversarial learning framework\nto tackle the domain shift problem in the unlabeled target domain. First, we\ndevelop unshared attention mechanisms to preserve the domain-specific features\nin the source and target domains. Second, we design a self-training strategy to\nalign the fine-grained class distributions for the source and target domains\nvia target domain pseudo labels. We also propose dual distinct classifiers to\nincrease the robustness and quality of the pseudo labels. The experimental\nresults on six cross-domain scenarios validate the efficacy of our proposed\nframework for sleep staging and its advantage over state-of-the-art UDA\nmethods.",

    "abstract": "One of the challenges in a task oriented natural language application like\nthe Google Assistant, Siri, or Alexa is to localize the output to many\nlanguages. This paper explores doing this by applying machine translation to\nthe English output. Using machine translation is very scalable, as it can work\nwith any English output and can handle dynamic text, but otherwise the problem\nis a poor fit. The required quality bar is close to perfection, the range of\nsentences is extremely narrow, and the sentences are often very different than\nthe ones in the machine translation training data. This combination of\nrequirements is novel in the field of domain adaptation for machine\ntranslation. We are able to reach the required quality bar by building on\nexisting ideas and adding new ones: finetuning on in-domain translations,\nadding sentences from the Web, adding semantic annotations, and using automatic\nerror detection. The paper shares our approach and results, together with a\ndistillation model to serve the translation models at scale.",

    "abstract": "In an active power distribution system, Volt-VAR optimization (VVO) methods\nare employed to achieve network-level objectives such as minimization of\nnetwork power losses. The commonly used model-based centralized and distributed\nVVO algorithms perform poorly in the absence of a communication system and with\nmodel and measurement uncertainties. In this paper, we proposed a model-free\nlocal Volt-VAR control approach for network-level optimization that does not\nrequire communication with other decision-making agents. The proposed algorithm\nis based on extremum-seeking approach that uses only local measurements to\nminimize the network power losses. To prove that the proposed extremum-seeking\ncontroller converges to the optimum solution, we also derive mathematical\nconditions for which the loss minimization problem is convex with respect to\nthe control variables. Local controllers pose stability concerns during highly\nvariable scenarios. Thus, the proposed extremum-seeking controller is\nintegrated with an adaptive-droop control module to provide a stable local\ncontrol response. The proposed approach is validated using IEEE 4-bus and IEEE\n123-bus systems and achieves the loss minimization objective while maintaining\nthe voltage within the pre-specific limits even during highly variable DER\ngeneration scenarios.",

We further\ndemonstrate the applicability of our algorithms in RL in the generative model\nsetting, resulting in improved sample complexity over prior approaches.\nFinally, we show that the standard optimistic algorithms (e.g., UCB) are\nsub-optimal by dimension factors. In the neural net setting (with polynomial\nactivation functions) with noiseless reward, we provide a bandit algorithm with\nsample complexity equal to the intrinsic algebraic dimension.

Unfortunately, (i)\ndifferent programming languages present language-specific code commenting\nnotations/guidelines; and (ii) the source code of software projects often lacks\ncomments that adequately describe the class behavior, which complicates program\ncomprehension and evolution activities.\nTo handle these challenges, this paper investigates the different\nlanguage-specific class commenting practices of three programming languages:\nPython, Java, and Smalltalk. In particular, we systematically analyze the\nsimilarities and differences of the information types found in class comments\nof projects developed in these languages.\nWe propose an approach that leverages two techniques, namely Natural Language\nProcessing and Text Analysis, to automatically identify various types of\ninformation from class comments i.e., the specific types of semantic\ninformation found in class comments. To the best of our knowledge, no previous\nwork has provided a comprehensive taxonomy of class comment types for these\nthree programming languages with the help of a common automated approach. Our\nresults confirm that our approach can classify frequent class comment\ninformation types with high accuracy for Python, Java, and Smalltalk\nprogramming languages.

    "abstract": "In order to handle the challenges of autonomous driving, deep learning has\nproven to be crucial in tackling increasingly complex tasks, such as 3D\ndetection or instance segmentation. State-of-the-art approaches for image-based\ndetection tasks tackle this complexity by operating in a cascaded fashion: they\nfirst extract a 2D bounding box based on which additional attributes, e.g.\ninstance masks, are inferred. While these methods perform well, a key challenge\nremains the lack of accurate and cheap annotations for the growing variety of\ntasks. Synthetic data presents a promising solution but, despite the effort in\ndomain adaptation research, the gap between synthetic and real data remains an\nopen problem. In this work, we propose a weakly supervised domain adaptation\nsetting which exploits the structure of cascaded detection tasks. In\nparticular, we learn to infer the attributes solely from the source domain\nwhile leveraging 2D bounding boxes as weak labels in both domains to explain\nthe domain shift. We further encourage domain-invariant features through\nclass-wise feature alignment using ground-truth class information, which is not\navailable in the unsupervised setting.

However, current random walk approaches are limited in the\ncombination and heterogeneity of network layers they can handle. New analytical\nand numerical random walk methods are needed to cope with the increasing\ndiversity and complexity of multilayer networks. We propose here MultiXrank, a\nPython package that enables Random Walk with Restart (RWR) on any kind of\nmultilayer network with an optimized implementation. This package is supported\nby a universal mathematical formulation of the RWR. We evaluated MultiXrank\nwith leave-one-out cross-validation and link prediction, and introduced\nprotocols to measure the impact of the addition or removal of multilayer\nnetwork data on prediction performances. We further measured the sensitivity of\nMultiXrank to input parameters by in-depth exploration of the parameter space.\nFinally, we illustrate the versatility of MultiXrank with different use-cases\nof unsupervised node prioritization and supervised classification in the\ncontext of human genetic diseases.",

    "abstract": "ECG is an attractive option to assess stress in serious Virtual Reality (VR)\napplications due to its non-invasive nature. However, the existing Machine\nLearning (ML) models perform poorly. Moreover, existing studies only perform a\nbinary stress assessment, while to develop a more engaging biofeedback-based\napplication, multi-level assessment is necessary. Existing studies annotate and\nclassify a single experience (e.g. watching a VR video) to a single stress\nlevel, which again prevents design of dynamic experiences where real-time\nin-game stress assessment can be utilized. In this paper, we report our\nfindings on a new study on VR stress assessment, where three stress levels are\nassessed. ECG data was collected from 9 users experiencing a VR roller coaster.\nThe VR experience was then manually labeled in 10-seconds segments to three\nstress levels by three raters. We then propose a novel multimodal deep fusion\nmodel utilizing spectrogram and 1D ECG that can provide a stress prediction\nfrom just a 1-second window. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed\nmodel outperforms the classical HRV-based ML models (9% increase in accuracy)\nand baseline deep learning models (2.5% increase in accuracy). We also report\nresults on the benchmark WESAD dataset to show the supremacy of the model.",

    "abstract": "Randomized smoothing has recently emerged as an effective tool that enables\ncertification of deep neural network classifiers at scale. All prior art on\nrandomized smoothing has focused on isotropic $\\ell_p$ certification, which has\nthe advantage of yielding certificates that can be easily compared among\nisotropic methods via $\\ell_p$-norm radius. However, isotropic certification\nlimits the region that can be certified around an input to worst-case\nadversaries, \\ie it cannot reason about other \"close\", potentially large,\nconstant prediction safe regions. To alleviate this issue, (i) we theoretically\nextend the isotropic randomized smoothing $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ certificates to\ntheir generalized anisotropic counterparts following a simplified analysis.\nMoreover, (ii) we propose evaluation metrics allowing for the comparison of\ngeneral certificates - a certificate is superior to another if it certifies a\nsuperset region - with the quantification of each certificate through the\nvolume of the certified region. We introduce ANCER, a practical framework for\nobtaining anisotropic certificates for a given test set sample via volume\nmaximization. Our empirical results demonstrate that ANCER achieves\nstate-of-the-art $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ certified accuracy on both CIFAR-10 and\nImageNet at multiple radii, while certifying substantially larger regions in\nterms of volume, thus highlighting the benefits of moving away from isotropic\nanalysis.

These functions are known as black-boxes, for example, estimating\nthe generalization error of a machine learning algorithm and computing its\nprediction time in terms of its hyper-parameters. Multi-objective Bayesian\noptimization (MOBO) is a set of methods that has been successfully applied for\nthe simultaneous optimization of black-boxes. Concretely, BO methods rely on a\nprobabilistic model of the objective functions, typically a Gaussian process.\nThis model generates a predictive distribution of the objectives. However, MOBO\nmethods have problems when the number of objectives in a multi-objective\noptimization problem are 3 or more, which is the many objective setting. In\nparticular, the BO process is more costly as more objectives are considered,\ncomputing the quality of the solution via the hyper-volume is also more costly\nand, most importantly, we have to evaluate every objective function, wasting\nexpensive computational, economic or other resources. However, as more\nobjectives are involved in the optimization problem, it is highly probable that\nsome of them are redundant and not add information about the problem solution.\nA measure that represents how similar are GP predictive distributions is\nproposed. We also propose a many objective Bayesian optimization algorithm that\nuses this metric to determine whether two objectives are redundant. The\nalgorithm stops evaluating one of them if the similarity is found, saving\nresources and not hurting the performance of the multi-objective BO algorithm.\nWe show empirical evidence in a set of toy, synthetic, benchmark and real\nexperiments that GPs predictive distributions of the effectiveness of the\nmetric and the algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Relatively abundant availability of medical imaging data has provided\nsignificant support in the development and testing of Neural Network based\nimage processing methods. Clinicians often face issues in selecting suitable\nimage processing algorithm for medical imaging data. A strategy for the\nselection of a proper model is presented here. The training data set comprises\noptical coherence tomography (OCT) and angiography (OCT-A) images of 50 mice\neyes with more than 100 days follow-up. The data contains images from treated\nand untreated mouse eyes. Four deep learning variants are tested for automatic\n(a) differentiation of tumor region with healthy retinal layer and (b)\nsegmentation of 3D ocular tumor volumes. Exhaustive sensitivity analysis of\ndeep learning models is performed with respect to the number of training and\ntesting images using 8 eight performance indices to study accuracy,\nreliability/reproducibility, and speed. U-net with UVgg16 is best for malign\ntumor data set with treatment (having considerable variation) and U-net with\nInception backbone for benign tumor data (with minor variation). Loss value and\nroot mean square error (R.M.S.E.) are found most and least sensitive\nperformance indices, respectively. The performance (via indices) is found to be\nexponentially improving regarding a number of training images. The segmented\nOCT-Angiography data shows that neovascularization drives the tumor volume.\nImage analysis shows that photodynamic imaging-assisted tumor treatment\nprotocol is transforming an aggressively growing tumor into a cyst. An\nempirical expression is obtained to help medical professionals to choose a\nparticular model given the number of images and types of characteristics. We\nrecommend that the presented exercise should be taken as standard practice\nbefore employing a particular deep learning model for biomedical image\nanalysis.",

The network is trained without ground truth information, based on the\ndifference between the model prediction and the individual STFT time frames.\nSince some of the model parameters do not yield a useful backpropagation\ngradient, we model them stochastically and employ the policy gradient instead.\nTo provide phase information and account for inaccuracies in the\ndictionary-based representation, we also let the network output a direct\nprediction, which we then use to resynthesize the audio signals for the\nindividual instruments.

    "abstract": "Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a prevalent imaging technique for\nretina. However, it is affected by multiplicative speckle noise that can\ndegrade the visibility of essential anatomical structures, including blood\nvessels and tissue layers. Although averaging repeated B-scan frames can\nsignificantly improve the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR), this requires longer\nacquisition time, which can introduce motion artifacts and cause discomfort to\npatients. In this study, we propose a learning-based method that exploits\ninformation from the single-frame noisy B-scan and a pseudo-modality that is\ncreated with the aid of the self-fusion method. The pseudo-modality provides\ngood SNR for layers that are barely perceptible in the noisy B-scan but can\nover-smooth fine features such as small vessels. By using a fusion network,\ndesired features from each modality can be combined, and the weight of their\ncontribution is adjustable. Evaluated by intensity-based and structural\nmetrics, the result shows that our method can effectively suppress the speckle\nnoise and enhance the contrast between retina layers while the overall\nstructure and small blood vessels are preserved.

Yet standard training methods for deep\nnetworks often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where learning new tasks\nerases knowledge of earlier tasks. While catastrophic forgetting labels the\nproblem, the theoretical reasons for interference between tasks remain unclear.\nHere, we attempt to narrow this gap between theory and practice by studying\ncontinual learning in the teacher-student setup. We extend previous analytical\nwork on two-layer networks in the teacher-student setup to multiple teachers.\nUsing each teacher to represent a different task, we investigate how the\nrelationship between teachers affects the amount of forgetting and transfer\nexhibited by the student when the task switches. In line with recent work, we\nfind that when tasks depend on similar features, intermediate task similarity\nleads to greatest forgetting. However, feature similarity is only one way in\nwhich tasks may be related. The teacher-student approach allows us to\ndisentangle task similarity at the level of readouts (hidden-to-output weights)\nand features (input-to-hidden weights). We find a complex interplay between\nboth types of similarity, initial transfer/forgetting rates, maximum\ntransfer/forgetting, and long-term transfer/forgetting.

We trace the different\nsources of non-convexification in the context of topology optimization problems\nstarting from domain discretization, passing through penalization for\ndiscreteness and effects of filtering methods, and end with a note on\ncontinuation methods. Design/Methodology/Approach: Starting from the global\noptimum of the compliance minimization problem, we employ analytical tools to\ninvestigate how intermediate density penalization affects the convexity of the\nproblem, the potential penalization-like effects of various filtering\ntechniques, how continuation methods can be used to approach the global\noptimum, and how the initial guess has some weight in determining the final\noptimum. Findings: The non-convexification effects of the penalization of\nintermediate density elements simply overshadows any other type of\nnon-convexification introduced into the problem, mainly due to its severity and\nlocality. Continuation methods are strongly recommended to overcome the problem\nof local minima, albeit its step and convergence criteria are left to the user\ndepending on the type of application.

    "abstract": "This paper is a review of a particular approach to the method of maximum\nentropy as a general framework for inference. The discussion emphasizes the\npragmatic elements in the derivation. An epistemic notion of information is\ndefined in terms of its relation to the Bayesian beliefs of ideally rational\nagents. The method of updating from a prior to a posterior probability\ndistribution is designed through an eliminative induction process. The\nlogarithmic relative entropy is singled out as the unique tool for updating\nthat (a) is of universal applicability; (b) that recognizes the value of prior\ninformation; and (c) that recognizes the privileged role played by the notion\nof independence in science. The resulting framework -- the ME method -- can\nhandle arbitrary priors and arbitrary constraints. It includes MaxEnt and\nBayes' rule as special cases and, therefore, it unifies entropic and Bayesian\nmethods into a single general inference scheme. The ME method goes beyond the\nmere selection of a single posterior, but also addresses the question of how\nmuch less probable other distributions might be, which provides a direct bridge\nto the theories of fluctuations and large deviations.",

    "abstract": "Reduced Order Modelling (ROM) has been widely used to create lower order,\ncomputationally inexpensive representations of higher-order dynamical systems.\nUsing these representations, ROMs can efficiently model flow fields while using\nsignificantly lesser parameters. Conventional ROMs accomplish this by linearly\nprojecting higher-order manifolds to lower-dimensional space using\ndimensionality reduction techniques such as Proper Orthogonal Decomposition\n(POD). In this work, we develop a novel deep learning framework DL-ROM (Deep\nLearning - Reduced Order Modelling) to create a neural network capable of\nnon-linear projections to reduced order states. We then use the learned reduced\nstate to efficiently predict future time steps of the simulation using 3D\nAutoencoder and 3D U-Net based architectures. Our model DL-ROM is able to\ncreate highly accurate reconstructions from the learned ROM and is thus able to\nefficiently predict future time steps by temporally traversing in the learned\nreduced state. All of this is achieved without ground truth supervision or\nneeding to iteratively solve the expensive Navier-Stokes(NS) equations thereby\nresulting in massive computational savings. To test the effectiveness and\nperformance of our approach, we evaluate our implementation on five different\nComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) datasets using reconstruction performance\nand computational runtime metrics. DL-ROM can reduce the computational runtimes\nof iterative solvers by nearly two orders of magnitude while maintaining an\nacceptable error threshold.",

The rule, derived from\nBayesian principles, yields a wide-range of algorithms from fields such as\noptimization, deep learning, and graphical models. This includes classical\nalgorithms such as ridge regression, Newton's method, and Kalman filter, as\nwell as modern deep-learning algorithms such as stochastic-gradient descent,\nRMSprop, and Dropout. The key idea in deriving such algorithms is to\napproximate the posterior using candidate distributions estimated by using\nnatural gradients. Different candidate distributions result in different\nalgorithms and further approximations to natural gradients give rise to\nvariants of those algorithms. Our work not only unifies, generalizes, and\nimproves existing algorithms, but also helps us design new ones.",

Mean field games have been\nintroduced to study Nash equilibria for such problems in the limit when the\nnumber of players is infinite. The theory has been extensively developed in the\npast decade, using both analytical and probabilistic tools, and a wide range of\napplications have been discovered, from economics to crowd motion. More\nrecently the interaction with machine learning has attracted a growing\ninterest. This aspect is particularly relevant to solve very large games with\ncomplex structures, in high dimension or with common sources of randomness.

Moreover, pretraining the n\nCNNs using various paradigms leads to a diverse feature set and further\nimproves the performance of the proposed n-CNN-ViT. We achieved a test accuracy\nof 98.04% with a weighted logarithmic loss value of 0.0708.
