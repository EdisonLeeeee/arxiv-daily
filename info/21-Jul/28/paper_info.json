In this paper, we give a relational adaptation of the\ngreedy algorithm for training boosted regression trees. For the subproblem of\ncalculating the sum of squared residuals of the dataset, which dominates the\nruntime of the boosting algorithm, we provide a $(1 + \\epsilon)$-approximation\nusing the tensor sketch technique.

    "title": "Training Energy-Efficient Deep Spiking Neural Networks with Single-Spike  Hybrid Input Encoding",
    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as an attractive alternative to\ntraditional deep learning frameworks, since they provide higher computational\nefficiency in event driven neuromorphic hardware. However, the state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) SNNs suffer from high inference latency, resulting from inefficient\ninput encoding and training techniques. The most widely used input coding\nschemes, such as Poisson based rate-coding, do not leverage the temporal\nlearning capabilities of SNNs. This paper presents a training framework for\nlow-latency energy-efficient SNNs that uses a hybrid encoding scheme at the\ninput layer in which the analog pixel values of an image are directly applied\nduring the first timestep and a novel variant of spike temporal coding is used\nduring subsequent timesteps. In particular, neurons in every hidden layer are\nrestricted to fire at most once per image which increases activation sparsity.\nTo train these hybrid-encoded SNNs, we propose a variant of the gradient\ndescent based spike timing dependent back propagation (STDB) mechanism using a\nnovel cross entropy loss function based on both the output neurons' spike time\nand membrane potential. The resulting SNNs have reduced latency and high\nactivation sparsity, yielding significant improvements in computational\nefficiency. In particular, we evaluate our proposed training scheme on image\nclassification tasks from CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets on several VGG\narchitectures. We achieve top-1 accuracy of $66.46$\\% with $5$ timesteps on the\nCIFAR-100 dataset with ${\\sim}125\\times$ less compute energy than an equivalent\nstandard ANN. Additionally, our proposed SNN performs $5$-$300\\times$ faster\ninference compared to other state-of-the-art rate or temporally coded SNN\nmodels.",

    "abstract": "An increasingly popular method for computing aggregate statistics while\npreserving users' privacy is local differential privacy (LDP).

Key value data is a naturally occurring data type that has not\nbeen thoroughly investigated in the local trust model. Existing LDP solutions\nfor computing statistics over key value data suffer from the inherent accuracy\nlimitations of each user adding their own noise.

    "abstract": "Advanced tensor decomposition, such as Tensor train (TT) and Tensor ring\n(TR), has been widely studied for deep neural network (DNN) model compression,\nespecially for recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, compressing\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) using TT/TR always suffers significant\naccuracy loss. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for tensor\ndecomposition-based model compression using Alternating Direction Method of\nMultipliers (ADMM). By formulating TT decomposition-based model compression to\nan optimization problem with constraints on tensor ranks, we leverage ADMM\ntechnique to systemically solve this optimization problem in an iterative way.\nDuring this procedure, the entire DNN model is trained in the original\nstructure instead of TT format, but gradually enjoys the desired low tensor\nrank characteristics. We then decompose this uncompressed model to TT format\nand fine-tune it to finally obtain a high-accuracy TT-format DNN model. Our\nframework is very general, and it works for both CNNs and RNNs, and can be\neasily modified to fit other tensor decomposition approaches. We evaluate our\nproposed framework on different DNN models for image classification and video\nrecognition tasks. Experimental results show that our ADMM-based TT-format\nmodels demonstrate very high compression performance with high accuracy.\nNotably, on CIFAR-100, with 2.3X and 2.4X compression ratios, our models have\n1.96% and 2.21% higher top-1 accuracy than the original ResNet-20 and\nResNet-32, respectively.

However, to\nperform well on complex vision applications, most SNN training frameworks yield\nlarge inference latency which translates to increased spike activity and\nreduced energy efficiency. Hence,minimizing average spike activity while\npreserving accuracy indeep SNNs remains a significant challenge and\nopportunity.This paper presents a non-iterative SNN training technique\nthatachieves ultra-high compression with reduced spiking activitywhile\nmaintaining high inference accuracy. In particular, our framework first uses\nthe attention-maps of an un compressed meta-model to yield compressed ANNs.\nThis step can be tuned to support both irregular and structured channel pruning\nto leverage computational benefits over a broad range of platforms. The\nframework then performs sparse-learning-based supervised SNN training using\ndirect inputs. During the training, it jointly optimizes the SNN weight,\nthreshold, and leak parameters to drastically minimize the number of time steps\nrequired while retaining compression. To evaluate the merits of our approach,\nwe performed experiments with variants of VGG and ResNet, on both CIFAR-10 and\nCIFAR-100, and VGG16 on Tiny-ImageNet.The SNN models generated through the\nproposed technique yield SOTA compression ratios of up to 33.4x with no\nsignificant drops in accuracy compared to baseline unpruned counterparts.\nCompared to existing SNN pruning methods, we achieve up to 8.3x higher\ncompression with improved accuracy.",

    "abstract": "We consider a distributed learning problem in a wireless network, consisting\nof N distributed edge devices and a parameter server (PS). The objective\nfunction is a sum of the edge devices' local loss functions, who aim to train a\nshared model by communicating with the PS over multiple access channels (MAC).\nThis problem has attracted a growing interest in distributed sensing systems,\nand more recently in federated learning, known as over-the-air computation. In\nthis paper, we develop a novel Accelerated Gradient-descent Multiple Access\n(AGMA) algorithm that uses momentum-based gradient signals over noisy fading\nMAC to improve the convergence rate as compared to existing methods.\nFurthermore, AGMA does not require power control or beamforming to cancel the\nfading effect, which simplifies the implementation complexity. We analyze AGMA\ntheoretically, and establish a finite-sample bound of the error for both convex\nand strongly convex loss functions with Lipschitz gradient. For the strongly\nconvex case, we show that AGMA approaches the best-known linear convergence\nrate as the network increases. For the convex case, we show that AGMA\nsignificantly improves the sub-linear convergence rate as compared to existing\nmethods. Finally, we present simulation results using real datasets that\ndemonstrate better performance by AGMA.",

Our\nhypothesis is that perturbations produced in the wavelet space disrupt early\nconvolutional layers more effectively than perturbations performed in the time\ndomain. The main challenge in adversarial attacks is to preserve low frequency\nimage content while minimally changing the most meaningful high frequency\ncontent. To address this, we formulate an optimization problem using time-scale\n(wavelet) representations as a dual space in three steps. First, we project\noriginal images into orthonormal sub-spaces for low and high scales via wavelet\ncoefficients. Second, we perturb wavelet coefficients for high scale projection\nusing a generator network. Third, we generate new adversarial images by\nprojecting back the original coefficients from the low scale and the perturbed\ncoefficients from the high scale sub-space. We provide a theoretical framework\nthat guarantees a dual mapping from time and time-scale domain representations.\nWe compare our results with state-of-the-art black-box attacks from\ngenerative-based and gradient-based models. We also verify efficacy against\nmultiple defense methods such as JPEG compression, Guided Denoiser and\nComdefend.

Motivated by this problem, this study presents an algorithmic\nmethod to enable accurate spinning motions over uneven terrain and constrain\nthe spinning radius of the Center of Mass (CoM) to be bounded within a small\nrange so as to minimize the drift risks. A modified spherical foot kinematics\nrepresentation is proposed to improve the foot kinematic model and rolling\ndynamics of the quadruped during locomotion.

Accurate\nmotion tracking is accomplished with Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) to bound\nthe position drift during the spinning movement.

In these settings,\nparticipants (workers) may not trust each other fully; for instance, a set of\ncompetitors may collaboratively train a machine learning model to detect fraud.\nThe workers provide local gradients that a central server uses to update a\nglobal model. This global model can be corrupted when Byzantine workers send\nmalicious gradients, which necessitates robust methods for aggregating\ngradients that mitigate the adverse effects of Byzantine inputs. Existing\nrobust aggregation algorithms are often computationally expensive and only\neffective under strict assumptions. In this paper, we introduce LayerwisE\nGradient AggregatTiOn (LEGATO), an aggregation algorithm that is, by contrast,\nscalable and generalizable. Informed by a study of layer-specific responses of\ngradients to Byzantine attacks, LEGATO employs a dynamic gradient reweighing\nscheme that is novel in its treatment of gradients based on layer-specific\nrobustness. We show that LEGATO is more computationally efficient than multiple\nstate-of-the-art techniques and more generally robust across a variety of\nattack settings in practice.

We propose a novel Binary Extended Gaussian Image (BEGI), which\nrepresents the point cloud surface normals of both object and robot fingers as\nsignals on a 2-sphere. Spherical harmonics are then used to estimate the\ncorrelation between fingers and object BEGIs. The resulting spectral\ncorrelation density function provides a similarity measure of gripper and\nobject surface normals. This is highly efficient in that it is simultaneously\nevaluated at all possible finger rotations in SO(3). A set of contact points\nare then extracted for each finger using rotations with high correlation\nvalues.

We evaluate the performance of SpectGRASP by\nconducting experiments with a 7-axis robot fitted with a parallel-jaw gripper,\nin a physics simulation environment.

    "abstract": "Traffic accidents are a threat to human lives, particularly pedestrians\ncausing premature deaths. Therefore, it is necessary to devise systems to\nprevent accidents in advance and respond proactively, using potential risky\nsituations as one of the surrogate safety measurements. This study introduces a\nnew concept of a pedestrian safety system that combines the field and the\ncentralized processes. The system can warn of upcoming risks immediately in the\nfield and improve the safety of risk frequent areas by assessing the safety\nlevels of roads without actual collisions. In particular, this study focuses on\nthe latter by introducing a new analytical framework for a crosswalk safety\nassessment with behaviors of vehicle/pedestrian and environmental features. We\nobtain these behavioral features from actual traffic video footage in the city\nwith complete automatic processing. The proposed framework mainly analyzes\nthese behaviors in multidimensional perspectives by constructing a data cube\nstructure, which combines the LSTM based predictive collision risk estimation\nmodel and the on line analytical processing operations. From the PCR estimation\nmodel, we categorize the severity of risks as four levels and apply the\nproposed framework to assess the crosswalk safety with behavioral features. Our\nanalytic experiments are based on two scenarios, and the various descriptive\nresults are harvested the movement patterns of vehicles and pedestrians by road\nenvironment and the relationships between risk levels and car speeds. Thus, the\nproposed framework can support decision makers by providing valuable\ninformation to improve pedestrian safety for future accidents, and it can help\nus better understand their behaviors near crosswalks proactively. In order to\nconfirm the feasibility and applicability of the proposed framework, we\nimplement and apply it to actual operating CCTVs in Osan City, Korea.",

    "abstract": "Recent learning approaches that implicitly represent surface geometry using\ncoordinate-based neural representations have shown impressive results in the\nproblem of multi-view 3D reconstruction. The effectiveness of these techniques\nis, however, subject to the availability of a large number (several tens) of\ninput views of the scene, and computationally demanding optimizations. In this\npaper, we tackle these limitations for the specific problem of few-shot full 3D\nhead reconstruction, by endowing coordinate-based representations with a\nprobabilistic shape prior that enables faster convergence and better\ngeneralization when using few input images (down to three). First, we learn a\nshape model of 3D heads from thousands of incomplete raw scans using implicit\nrepresentations. At test time, we jointly overfit two coordinate-based neural\nnetworks to the scene, one modeling the geometry and another estimating the\nsurface radiance, using implicit differentiable rendering. We devise a\ntwo-stage optimization strategy in which the learned prior is used to\ninitialize and constrain the geometry during an initial optimization phase.\nThen, the prior is unfrozen and fine-tuned to the scene. By doing this, we\nachieve high-fidelity head reconstructions, including hair and shoulders, and\nwith a high level of detail that consistently outperforms both state-of-the-art\n3D Morphable Models methods in the few-shot scenario, and non-parametric\nmethods when large sets of views are available.",

Flat images of candidate mice may not\nprovide the discriminative information needed for \"wireless\". The world, and\nobjects in it, are not flat images but complex 3D shapes. If a human requests\nan object based on any of its basic properties, such as color, shape, or\ntexture, robots should perform the necessary exploration to accomplish the\ntask. In particular, while substantial effort and progress has been made on\nunderstanding explicitly visual attributes like color and category,\ncomparatively little progress has been made on understanding language about\nshapes and contours. In this work, we introduce a novel reasoning task that\ntargets both visual and non-visual language about 3D objects. Our new\nbenchmark, ShapeNet Annotated with Referring Expressions (SNARE), requires a\nmodel to choose which of two objects is being referenced by a natural language\ndescription. We introduce several CLIP-based models for distinguishing objects\nand demonstrate that while recent advances in jointly modeling vision and\nlanguage are useful for robotic language understanding, it is still the case\nthat these models are weaker at understanding the 3D nature of objects --\nproperties which play a key role in manipulation.

    "title": "Double Deep Q-learning Based Real-Time Optimization Strategy for  Microgrids",
    "abstract": "The uncertainties from distributed energy resources (DERs) bring significant\nchallenges to the real-time operation of microgrids. In addition, due to the\nnonlinear constraints in the AC power flow equation and the nonlinearity of the\nbattery storage model, etc., the optimization of the microgrid is a\nmixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. It is challenging to solve\nthis kind of stochastic nonlinear optimization problem. To address the\nchallenge, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based\noptimization strategy for the real-time operation of the microgrid.\nSpecifically, we construct the detailed operation model for the microgrid and\nformulate the real-time optimization problem as a Markov Decision Process\n(MDP). Then, a double deep Q network (DDQN) based architecture is designed to\nsolve the MINLP problem. The proposed approach can learn a near-optimal\nstrategy only from the historical data. The effectiveness of the proposed\nalgorithm is validated by the simulations on a 10-bus microgrid system and a\nmodified IEEE 69-bus microgrid system. The numerical simulation results\ndemonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms several existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Visualization recommendation or automatic visualization generation can\nsignificantly lower the barriers for general users to rapidly create effective\ndata visualizations, especially for those users without a background in data\nvisualizations. However, existing rule-based approaches require tedious manual\nspecifications of visualization rules by visualization experts. Other machine\nlearning-based approaches often work like black-box and are difficult to\nunderstand why a specific visualization is recommended, limiting the wider\nadoption of these approaches. This paper fills the gap by presenting KG4Vis, a\nknowledge graph (KG)-based approach for visualization recommendation. It does\nnot require manual specifications of visualization rules and can also guarantee\ngood explainability. Specifically, we propose a framework for building\nknowledge graphs, consisting of three types of entities (i.e., data features,\ndata columns and visualization design choices) and the relations between them,\nto model the mapping rules between data and effective visualizations. A\nTransE-based embedding technique is employed to learn the embeddings of both\nentities and relations of the knowledge graph from existing\ndataset-visualization pairs. Such embeddings intrinsically model the desirable\nvisualization rules. Then, given a new dataset, effective visualizations can be\ninferred from the knowledge graph with semantically meaningful rules. We\nconducted extensive evaluations to assess the proposed approach, including\nquantitative comparisons, case studies and expert interviews.

In this paper, we\npresent a novel approach for scalable 6D pose estimation, by self-supervised\nlearning on synthetic data of multiple objects using a single autoencoder. To\nhandle multiple objects and generalize to unseen objects, we disentangle the\nlatent object shape and pose representations, so that the latent shape space\nmodels shape similarities, and the latent pose code is used for rotation\nretrieval by comparison with canonical rotations. To encourage shape space\nconstruction, we apply contrastive metric learning and enable the processing of\nunseen objects by referring to similar training objects. The different\nsymmetries across objects induce inconsistent latent pose spaces, which we\ncapture with a conditioned block producing shape-dependent pose codebooks by\nre-entangling shape and pose representations. We test our method on two\nmulti-object benchmarks with real data, T-LESS and NOCS REAL275, and show it\noutperforms existing RGB-based methods in terms of pose estimation accuracy and\ngeneralization.",

It does not require the target\nspeakers to be experts in expressing all styles and to collect corresponding\nrecordings for model training. However, the performances of existing style\ntransfer methods are still far behind real application needs. The root causes\nare mainly twofold. Firstly, the style embedding extracted from single\nreference speech can hardly provide fine-grained and appropriate prosody\ninformation for arbitrary text to synthesize. Secondly, in these models the\ncontent/text, prosody, and speaker timbre are usually highly entangled, it's\ntherefore not realistic to expect a satisfied result when freely combining\nthese components, such as to transfer speaking style between speakers. In this\npaper, we propose a cross-speaker style transfer text-to-speech (TTS) model\nwith explicit prosody bottleneck. The prosody bottleneck builds up the kernels\naccounting for speaking style robustly, and disentangles the prosody from\ncontent and speaker timbre, therefore guarantees high quality cross-speaker\nstyle transfer. Evaluation result shows the proposed method even achieves\non-par performance with source speaker's speaker-dependent (SD) model in\nobjective measurement of prosody, and significantly outperforms the cycle\nconsistency and GMVAE-based baselines in objective and subjective evaluations.",

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Network (DNN) trained object detectors are widely deployed in\nmany mission-critical systems for real time video analytics at the edge, such\nas autonomous driving and video surveillance. A common performance requirement\nin these mission-critical edge services is the near real-time latency of online\nobject detection on edge devices. However, even with well-trained DNN object\ndetectors, the online detection quality at edge may deteriorate for a number of\nreasons, such as limited capacity to run DNN object detection models on\nheterogeneous edge devices, and detection quality degradation due to random\nframe dropping when the detection processing rate is significantly slower than\nthe incoming video frame rate. This paper addresses these problems by\nexploiting multi-model multi-device detection parallelism for fast object\ndetection in edge systems with heterogeneous edge devices. First, we analyze\nthe performance bottleneck of running a well-trained DNN model at edge for real\ntime online object detection. We use the offline detection as a reference\nmodel, and examine the root cause by analyzing the mismatch among the incoming\nvideo streaming rate, video processing rate for object detection, and output\nrate for real time detection visualization of video streaming. Second, we study\nperformance optimizations by exploiting multi-model detection parallelism. We\nshow that the model-parallel detection approach can effectively speed up the\nFPS detection processing rate, minimizing the FPS disparity with the incoming\nvideo frame rate on heterogeneous edge devices. We evaluate the proposed\napproach using SSD300 and YOLOv3 on benchmark videos of different video stream\nrates.

    "abstract": "The goal of dialogue state tracking (DST) is to predict the current dialogue\nstate given all previous dialogue contexts. Existing approaches generally\npredict the dialogue state at every turn from scratch. However, the\noverwhelming majority of the slots in each turn should simply inherit the slot\nvalues from the previous turn. Therefore, the mechanism of treating slots\nequally in each turn not only is inefficient but also may lead to additional\nerrors because of the redundant slot value generation. To address this problem,\nwe devise the two-stage DSS-DST which consists of the Dual Slot Selector based\non the current turn dialogue, and the Slot Value Generator based on the\ndialogue history. The Dual Slot Selector determines each slot whether to update\nslot value or to inherit the slot value from the previous turn from two\naspects: (1) if there is a strong relationship between it and the current turn\ndialogue utterances; (2) if a slot value with high reliability can be obtained\nfor it through the current turn dialogue. The slots selected to be updated are\npermitted to enter the Slot Value Generator to update values by a hybrid\nmethod, while the other slots directly inherit the values from the previous\nturn.

    "title": "Pointer Value Retrieval: A new benchmark for understanding the limits of  neural network generalization",
    "abstract": "The successes of deep learning critically rely on the ability of neural\nnetworks to output meaningful predictions on unseen data -- generalization. Yet\ndespite its criticality, there remain fundamental open questions on how neural\nnetworks generalize. How much do neural networks rely on memorization -- seeing\nhighly similar training examples -- and how much are they capable of\nhuman-intelligence styled reasoning -- identifying abstract rules underlying\nthe data? In this paper we introduce a novel benchmark, Pointer Value Retrieval\n(PVR) tasks, that explore the limits of neural network generalization. While\nPVR tasks can consist of visual as well as symbolic inputs, each with varying\nlevels of difficulty, they all have a simple underlying rule. One part of the\nPVR task input acts as a pointer, giving the location of a different part of\nthe input, which forms the value (and output). We demonstrate that this task\nstructure provides a rich testbed for understanding generalization, with our\nempirical study showing large variations in neural network performance based on\ndataset size, task complexity and model architecture. The interaction of\nposition, values and the pointer rule also allow the development of nuanced\ntests of generalization, by introducing distribution shift and increasing\nfunctional complexity. These reveal both subtle failures and surprising\nsuccesses, suggesting many promising directions of exploration on this\nbenchmark.",

    "abstract": "Given the proximity of many wireless users and their diversity in consuming\nlocal resources (e.g., data-plans, computation and even energy resources),\ndevice-to-device (D2D) resource sharing is a promising approach towards\nrealizing a sharing economy. In the resulting networked economy, $n$ users\nsegment themselves into sellers and buyers that need to be efficiently matched\nlocally. This paper adopts an easy-to-implement greedy matching algorithm with\ndistributed fashion and only sub-linear $O(\\log n)$ parallel complexity, which\noffers a great advantage compared to the optimal but computational-expensive\ncentralized matching. But is it efficient compared to the optimal matching?\nExtensive simulations indicate that in a large number of practical cases the\naverage loss is no more than $10\\%$, a far better result than the $50\\%$ loss\nbound in the worst case. However, there is no rigorous average-case analysis in\nthe literature to back up such encouraging findings, which is a fundamental\nstep towards supporting the practical use of greedy matching in D2D sharing.\nThis paper is the first to present the rigorous average analysis of certain\nrepresentative classes of graphs with random parameters, by proposing a new\nasymptotic methodology. For typical 2D grids with random matching weights we\nrigorously prove that our greedy algorithm performs better than $84.9\\%$ of the\noptimal, while for typical Erdos-Renyi random graphs we prove a lower bound of\n$79\\%$ when the graph is neither dense nor sparse. Finally, we use realistic\ndata to show that our random graph models approximate well D2D sharing networks\nencountered in practice.",

    "abstract": "In the classic setting of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), the labeled\nsource data are available in the training phase. However, in many real-world\nscenarios, owing to some reasons such as privacy protection and information\nsecurity, the source data is inaccessible, and only a model trained on the\nsource domain is available. This paper proposes a novel deep clustering method\nfor this challenging task. Aiming at the dynamical clustering at feature-level,\nwe introduce extra constraints hidden in the geometric structure between data\nto assist the process. Concretely, we propose a geometry-based constraint,\nnamed semantic consistency on the nearest neighborhood (SCNNH), and use it to\nencourage robust clustering. To reach this goal, we construct the nearest\nneighborhood for every target data and take it as the fundamental clustering\nunit by building our objective on the geometry. Also, we develop a more\nSCNNH-compliant structure with an additional semantic credibility constraint,\nnamed semantic hyper-nearest neighborhood (SHNNH). After that, we extend our\nmethod to this new geometry. Extensive experiments on three challenging UDA\ndatasets indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. The\nproposed method has significant improvement on all datasets (as we adopt SHNNH,\nthe average accuracy increases by over 3.0\\% on the large-scaled dataset).

    "abstract": "Weakly supervised temporal action localization (WS-TAL) is a challenging task\nthat aims to localize action instances in the given video with video-level\ncategorical supervision. Both appearance and motion features are used in\nprevious works, while they do not utilize them in a proper way but apply simple\nconcatenation or score-level fusion. In this work, we argue that the features\nextracted from the pretrained extractor, e.g., I3D, are not the\nWS-TALtask-specific features, thus the feature re-calibration is needed for\nreducing the task-irrelevant information redundancy. Therefore, we propose a\ncross-modal consensus network (CO2-Net) to tackle this problem. In CO2-Net, we\nmainly introduce two identical proposed cross-modal consensus modules (CCM)\nthat design a cross-modal attention mechanism to filter out the task-irrelevant\ninformation redundancy using the global information from the main modality and\nthe cross-modal local information of the auxiliary modality. Moreover, we treat\nthe attention weights derived from each CCMas the pseudo targets of the\nattention weights derived from another CCM to maintain the consistency between\nthe predictions derived from two CCMs, forming a mutual learning manner.\nFinally, we conduct extensive experiments on two common used temporal action\nlocalization datasets, THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.2, to verify our method and\nachieve the state-of-the-art results.

    "abstract": "Deep learning has proven effective for various application tasks, but its\napplicability is limited by the reliance on annotated examples. Self-supervised\nlearning has emerged as a promising direction to alleviate the supervision\nbottleneck, but existing work focuses on leveraging co-occurrences in unlabeled\ndata for task-agnostic representation learning, as exemplified by masked\nlanguage model pretraining. In this chapter, we explore task-specific\nself-supervision, which leverages domain knowledge to automatically annotate\nnoisy training examples for end applications, either by introducing labeling\nfunctions for annotating individual instances, or by imposing constraints over\ninterdependent label decisions. We first present deep probabilistic logic(DPL),\nwhich offers a unifying framework for task-specific self-supervision by\ncomposing probabilistic logic with deep learning. DPL represents unknown labels\nas latent variables and incorporates diverse self-supervision using\nprobabilistic logic to train a deep neural network end-to-end using variational\nEM. Next, we present self-supervised self-supervision(S4), which adds to DPL\nthe capability to learn new self-supervision automatically. Starting from an\ninitial seed self-supervision, S4 iteratively uses the deep neural network to\npropose new self supervision. These are either added directly (a form of\nstructured self-training) or verified by a human expert (as in feature-based\nactive learning). Experiments on real-world applications such as biomedical\nmachine reading and various text classification tasks show that task-specific\nself-supervision can effectively leverage domain expertise and often match the\naccuracy of supervised methods with a tiny fraction of human effort.",

Consequently, there is a need to have mechanisms in place to\ndetect cyber security attacks in a timely manner. A variety of Network\nIntrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) have been proposed and can be categorized\ninto signature-based NIDS and anomaly-based NIDS. The signature-based NIDS,\nwhich identify the misuse through scanning the activity signature against the\nlist of known attack activities, are criticized for their inability to identify\nnew attacks (never-before-seen attacks). Among anomaly-based NIDS, which\ndeclare a connection anomalous if it expresses deviation from a trained model,\nthe unsupervised learning algorithms circumvent this issue since they have the\nability to identify new attacks. In this study, we use an unsupervised learning\nalgorithm based on principal component analysis to detect cyber attacks. In the\ntraining phase, our approach has the advantage of also identifying outliers in\nthe training dataset. In the monitoring phase, our approach first identifies\nthe affected dimensions and then calculates an anomaly score by aggregating\nacross only those components that are affected by the anomalies. We explore the\nperformance of the algorithm via simulations and through two applications,\nnamely to the UNSW-NB15 dataset recently released by the Australian Centre for\nCyber Security and to the well-known KDD'99 dataset.

The\nfirst issue is that the self-attention mechanism learns sign video\nrepresentation in a frame-wise manner, neglecting the temporal semantic\nstructure of sign gestures. Secondly, the attention mechanism with absolute\nposition encoding is direction and distance unaware, thus limiting its ability.\nTo address these issues, we propose a new model architecture, namely PiSLTRc,\nwith two distinctive characteristics: (i) content-aware and position-aware\nconvolution layers.

    "abstract": "COVID-19, as a global health crisis, has triggered the fear emotion with\nunprecedented intensity. Besides the fear of getting infected, the outbreak of\nCOVID-19 also created significant disruptions in people's daily life and thus\nevoked intensive psychological responses indirect to COVID-19 infections. Here,\nwe construct an expressed fear database using 16 million social media posts\ngenerated by 536 thousand users between January 1st, 2019 and August 31st, 2020\nin China. We employ deep learning techniques to detect the fear emotion within\neach post and apply topic models to extract the central fear topics. Based on\nthis database, we find that sleep disorders (\"nightmare\" and \"insomnia\") take\nup the largest share of fear-labeled posts in the pre-pandemic period (January\n2019-December 2019), and significantly increase during the COVID-19. We\nidentify health and work-related concerns are the two major sources of fear\ninduced by the COVID-19. We also detect gender differences, with females\ngenerating more posts containing the daily-life fear sources during the\nCOVID-19 period. This research adopts a data-driven approach to trace back\npublic emotion, which can be used to complement traditional surveys to achieve\nreal-time emotion monitoring to discern societal concerns and support policy\ndecision-making.",

    "title": "Poisoning of Online Learning Filters: DDoS Attacks and Countermeasures",
    "abstract": "The recent advancements in machine learning have led to a wave of interest in\nadopting online learning-based approaches for long-standing attack mitigation\nissues. In particular, DDoS attacks remain a significant threat to network\nservice availability even after more than two decades. These attacks have been\nwell studied under the assumption that malicious traffic originates from a\nsingle attack profile. Based on this premise, malicious traffic characteristics\nare assumed to be considerably different from legitimate traffic. Consequently,\nonline filtering methods are designed to learn network traffic distributions\nadaptively and rank requests according to their attack likelihood. During an\nattack, requests rated as malicious are precipitously dropped by the filters.\nIn this paper, we conduct the first systematic study on the effects of data\npoisoning attacks on online DDoS filtering; introduce one such attack method,\nand propose practical protective countermeasures for these attacks. We\ninvestigate an adverse scenario where the attacker is \"crafty\", switching\nprofiles during attacks and generating erratic attack traffic that is\never-shifting. This elusive attacker generates malicious requests by\nmanipulating and shifting traffic distribution to poison the training data and\ncorrupt the filters. To this end, we present a generative model MimicShift,\ncapable of controlling traffic generation while retaining the originating\nregular traffic's intrinsic properties. Comprehensive experiments show that\nonline learning filters are highly susceptible to poisoning attacks, sometimes\nperforming much worse than a random filtering strategy in this attack scenario.\nAt the same time, our proposed protective countermeasure effectively minimizes\nthe attack impact.",

    "abstract": "Estimating the 6D pose of objects is beneficial for robotics tasks such as\ntransportation, autonomous navigation, manipulation as well as in scenarios\nbeyond robotics like virtual and augmented reality. With respect to single\nimage pose estimation, pose tracking takes into account the temporal\ninformation across multiple frames to overcome possible detection\ninconsistencies and to improve the pose estimation efficiency. In this work, we\nintroduce a novel Deep Neural Network (DNN) called VIPose, that combines\ninertial and camera data to address the object pose tracking problem in\nreal-time. The key contribution is the design of a novel DNN architecture which\nfuses visual and inertial features to predict the objects' relative 6D pose\nbetween consecutive image frames. The overall 6D pose is then estimated by\nconsecutively combining relative poses. Our approach shows remarkable pose\nestimation results for heavily occluded objects that are well known to be very\nchallenging to handle by existing state-of-the-art solutions. The effectiveness\nof the proposed approach is validated on a new dataset called VIYCB with RGB\nimage, IMU data, and accurate 6D pose annotations created by employing an\nautomated labeling technique.

Temporal Action\nLocalization (TAL) requires to not only precisely locate the temporal\nboundaries of action instances, but also accurately classify the untrimmed\nvideos into specific categories. However, Weakly-Supervised TAL indicates\nlocating the action instances using only video-level class labels. In this\npaper, to train a supervised temporal action localizer, we adopt Temporal\nContext Aggregation Network (TCANet) to generate high-quality action proposals\nthrough ``local and global\" temporal context aggregation and complementary as\nwell as progressive boundary refinement. As for the WSTAL, a novel framework is\nproposed to handle the poor quality of CAS generated by simple classification\nnetwork, which can only focus on local discriminative parts, rather than locate\nthe entire interval of target actions. Further inspired by the transfer\nlearning method, we also adopt an additional module to transfer the knowledge\nfrom trimmed videos (HACS Clips dataset) to untrimmed videos (HACS Segments\ndataset), aiming at promoting the classification performance on untrimmed\nvideos. Finally, we employ a boundary regression module embedded with\nOuter-Inner-Contrastive (OIC) loss to automatically predict the boundaries\nbased on the enhanced CAS.

    "abstract": "Recently, the problem of inaccurate learning targets in crowd counting draws\nincreasing attention. Inspired by a few pioneering work, we solve this problem\nby trying to predict the indices of pre-defined interval bins of counts instead\nof the count values themselves. However, an inappropriate interval setting\nmight make the count error contributions from different intervals extremely\nimbalanced, leading to inferior counting performance. Therefore, we propose a\nnovel count interval partition criterion called Uniform Error Partition (UEP),\nwhich always keeps the expected counting error contributions equal for all\nintervals to minimize the prediction risk. Then to mitigate the inevitably\nintroduced discretization errors in the count quantization process, we propose\nanother criterion called Mean Count Proxies (MCP). The MCP criterion selects\nthe best count proxy for each interval to represent its count value during\ninference, making the overall expected discretization error of an image nearly\nnegligible. As far as we are aware, this work is the first to delve into such a\nclassification task and ends up with a promising solution for count interval\npartition. Following the above two theoretically demonstrated criterions, we\npropose a simple yet effective model termed Uniform Error Partition Network\n(UEPNet), which achieves state-of-the-art performance on several challenging\ndatasets.

    "abstract": "Nowadays, multi-sensor technologies are applied in many fields, e.g., Health\nCare (HC), Human Activity Recognition (HAR), and Industrial Control System\n(ICS). These sensors can generate a substantial amount of multivariate\ntime-series data. Unsupervised anomaly detection on multi-sensor time-series\ndata has been proven critical in machine learning researches. The key challenge\nis to discover generalized normal patterns by capturing spatial-temporal\ncorrelation in multi-sensor data. Beyond this challenge, the noisy data is\noften intertwined with the training data, which is likely to mislead the model\nby making it hard to distinguish between the normal, abnormal, and noisy data.\nFew of previous researches can jointly address these two challenges. In this\npaper, we propose a novel deep learning-based anomaly detection algorithm\ncalled Deep Convolutional Autoencoding Memory network (CAE-M). We first build a\nDeep Convolutional Autoencoder to characterize spatial dependence of\nmulti-sensor data with a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to better distinguish\nbetween the noisy, normal, and abnormal data. Then, we construct a Memory\nNetwork consisting of linear (Autoregressive Model) and non-linear predictions\n(Bidirectional LSTM with Attention) to capture temporal dependence from\ntime-series data. Finally, CAE-M jointly optimizes these two subnetworks. We\nempirically compare the proposed approach with several state-of-the-art anomaly\ndetection methods on HAR and HC datasets.

In this work, building upon the recent works connecting\ncross-lingual model transferring and neural machine translation, we thus\npropose a novel cross-lingual model transferring framework for PrLMs: TreLM. To\nhandle the symbol order and sequence length differences between languages, we\npropose an intermediate ``TRILayer\" structure that learns from these\ndifferences and creates a better transfer in our primary translation direction,\nas well as a new cross-lingual language modeling objective for transfer\ntraining.

Experiments on both language\nunderstanding and structure parsing tasks show the proposed framework\nsignificantly outperforms language models trained from scratch with limited\ndata in both performance and efficiency.

However, discriminative classifiers based on\ndeep neural networks are often criticized for producing overconfident\npredictions that fail to reflect the true correctness likelihood of\nclassification accuracy. We argue that such an inability to model uncertainty\nis mainly caused by the closed-world nature in softmax: a model trained by the\ncross-entropy loss will be forced to classify input into one of $K$ pre-defined\ncategories with high probability. To address this problem, we for the first\ntime propose a novel $K$+1-way softmax formulation, which incorporates the\nmodeling of open-world uncertainty as the extra dimension. To unify the\nlearning of the original $K$-way classification task and the extra dimension\nthat models uncertainty, we propose a novel energy-based objective function,\nand moreover, theoretically prove that optimizing such an objective essentially\nforces the extra dimension to capture the marginal data distribution.

    "abstract": "Detection transformers have recently shown promising object detection results\nand attracted increasing attention. However, how to develop effective domain\nadaptation techniques to improve its cross-domain performance remains\nunexplored and unclear. In this paper, we delve into this topic and empirically\nfind that direct feature distribution alignment on the CNN backbone only brings\nlimited improvements, as it does not guarantee domain-invariant sequence\nfeatures in the transformer for prediction. To address this issue, we propose a\nnovel Sequence Feature Alignment (SFA) method that is specially designed for\nthe adaptation of detection transformers. Technically, SFA consists of a domain\nquery-based feature alignment (DQFA) module and a token-wise feature alignment\n(TDA) module. In DQFA, a novel domain query is used to aggregate and align\nglobal context from the token sequence of both domains. DQFA reduces the domain\ndiscrepancy in global feature representations and object relations when\ndeploying in the transformer encoder and decoder, respectively. Meanwhile, TDA\naligns token features in the sequence from both domains, which reduces the\ndomain gaps in local and instance-level feature representations in the\ntransformer encoder and decoder, respectively. Besides, a novel bipartite\nmatching consistency loss is proposed to enhance the feature discriminability\nfor robust object detection. Experiments on three challenging benchmarks show\nthat SFA outperforms state-of-the-art domain adaptive object detection methods.\nCode has been made available at: https://github.com/encounter1997/SFA.",

    "abstract": "Outlier detection is one of the most important processes taken to create\ngood, reliable data in machine learning. The most methods of outlier detection\nleverage an auxiliary reconstruction task by assuming that outliers are more\ndifficult to be recovered than normal samples (inliers). However, it is not\nalways true, especially for auto-encoder (AE) based models. They may recover\ncertain outliers even outliers are not in the training data, because they do\nnot constrain the feature learning. Instead, we think outlier detection can be\ndone in the feature space by measuring the feature distance between outliers\nand inliers. We then propose a framework, MCOD, using a memory module and a\ncontrastive learning module. The memory module constrains the consistency of\nfeatures, which represent the normal data. The contrastive learning module\nlearns more discriminating features, which boosts the distinction between\noutliers and inliers. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show\nthat our proposed MCOD achieves a considerable performance and outperforms nine\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a concept of computer vision-based guidance assistance\nfor agricultural vehicles to increase the accuracy in plowing and reduce\ndriver's cognitive burden in long-lasting tillage operations. Plowing is a\ncommon agricultural practice to prepare the soil for planting in many countries\nand it can take place both in the spring and the fall. Since plowing operation\nrequires high traction forces, it causes increased energy consumption.\nMoreover, longer operation time due to unnecessary maneuvers leads to higher\nfuel consumption. To provide necessary information for the driver and the\ncontrol unit of the tractor, a first concept of furrow detection system based\non an RGB-D camera was developed.",

However, new classes\noften emerge in real-world applications and should be learned incrementally.\nFor example, in electronic commerce, new types of products appear daily, and in\na social media community, new topics emerge frequently. Under such\ncircumstances, incremental models should learn several new classes at a time\nwithout forgetting. We find a strong correlation between old and new classes in\nincremental learning, which can be applied to relate and facilitate different\nlearning stages mutually. As a result, we propose CO-transport for class\nIncremental Learning (COIL), which learns to relate across incremental tasks\nwith the class-wise semantic relationship. In detail, co-transport has two\naspects: prospective transport tries to augment the old classifier with optimal\ntransported knowledge as fast model adaptation. Retrospective transport aims to\ntransport new class classifiers backward as old ones to overcome forgetting.\nWith these transports, COIL efficiently adapts to new tasks, and stably resists\nforgetting.

In this paper, we present Cubic Kernel Convolution (CKConv) that\nlearns to voxelize the features of local points by exploiting both continuous\nand discrete convolutions. Our continuous convolution uniquely employs a 3D\ncubic form of kernel weight representation that splits a feature into voxels in\nembedding space. By consecutively applying discrete 3D convolutions on the\nvoxelized features in a spatial manner, preceding continuous convolution is\nforced to learn spatial feature mapping, i.e., feature voxelization. In this\nway, geometric information can be detailed by encoding with subdivided\nfeatures, and our 3D convolutions on these fixed structured data do not suffer\nfrom discretization artifacts thanks to voxelization in embedding space.\nFurthermore, we propose a spatial attention module, Local Set Attention (LSA),\nto provide comprehensive structure awareness within the local point set and\nhence produce representative features.

    "abstract": "Deep learning provides accurate collaborative filtering models to improve\nrecommender system results. Deep matrix factorization and their related\ncollaborative neural networks are the state-of-art in the field; nevertheless,\nboth models lack the necessary stochasticity to create the robust, continuous,\nand structured latent spaces that variational autoencoders exhibit. On the\nother hand, data augmentation through variational autoencoder does not provide\naccurate results in the collaborative filtering field due to the high sparsity\nof recommender systems. Our proposed models apply the variational concept to\ninject stochasticity in the latent space of the deep architecture, introducing\nthe variational technique in the neural collaborative filtering field. This\nmethod does not depend on the particular model used to generate the latent\nrepresentation. In this way, this approach can be applied as a plugin to any\ncurrent and future specific models. The proposed models have been tested using\nfour representative open datasets, three different quality measures, and\nstate-of-art baselines. The results show the superiority of the proposed\napproach in scenarios where the variational enrichment exceeds the injected\nnoise effect. Additionally, a framework is provided to enable the\nreproducibility of the conducted experiments.",

First, to overcome the memory explosion of dense\nconnections, we utilize a memory-efficient multi-scale feature aggregation net\nas the generator.

Third, to balance the student\ndiscriminator and the compressed generator, we distill both the generator and\nthe discriminator.

    "title": "On the Role of Optimization in Double Descent: A Least Squares Study",
    "abstract": "Empirically it has been observed that the performance of deep neural networks\nsteadily improves as we increase model size, contradicting the classical view\non overfitting and generalization. Recently, the double descent phenomena has\nbeen proposed to reconcile this observation with theory, suggesting that the\ntest error has a second descent when the model becomes sufficiently\noverparameterized, as the model size itself acts as an implicit regularizer. In\nthis paper we add to the growing body of work in this space, providing a\ncareful study of learning dynamics as a function of model size for the least\nsquares scenario. We show an excess risk bound for the gradient descent\nsolution of the least squares objective. The bound depends on the smallest\nnon-zero eigenvalue of the covariance matrix of the input features, via a\nfunctional form that has the double descent behavior. This gives a new\nperspective on the double descent curves reported in the literature. Our\nanalysis of the excess risk allows to decouple the effect of optimization and\ngeneralization error. In particular, we find that in case of noiseless\nregression, double descent is explained solely by optimization-related\nquantities, which was missed in studies focusing on the Moore-Penrose\npseudoinverse solution. We believe that our derivation provides an alternative\nview compared to existing work, shedding some light on a possible cause of this\nphenomena, at least in the considered least squares setting. We empirically\nexplore if our predictions hold for neural networks, in particular whether the\ncovariance of intermediary hidden activations has a similar behavior as the one\npredicted by our derivations.",

Some design features\nof large-scale online discussion systems allow larger numbers of people to\ndiscuss shared problems, enhance critical thinking, and formulate solutions.\nHowever, scaling up deliberation is challenging. We review the\ntransdisciplinary literature on the design of digital mass-deliberation\nplatforms and examine the commonly featured design aspects (e.g., argumentation\nsupport, automated facilitation, and gamification). We find that the literature\nis heavily focused on developing technical fixes for scaling up deliberation,\nwith a heavy western influence on design and test users skew young and highly\neducated. Contrastingly, there is a distinct lack of discussion on the nature\nof the design process, the inclusion of stakeholders and issues relating to\ninclusion, which may unwittingly perpetuate bias. Another tendency of\ndeliberation platforms is to nudge participants to desired forms of\nargumentation, and simplifying definitions of good and bad arguments to fit\nalgorithmic purposes.

First, within a historical context, a general\nabsence of, and clear need for, tangible output that is dynamically\ninstantiated by the grain-generating process itself is identified. Second, to\nfill this gap, a concrete general approach is proposed based on the careful\nconstruction of non-vibratory and vibratory force pulses, in a one-to-one\nrelationship with sonic grains. An informal pilot psychophysics experiment\ninitiating the approach was conducted, which took into account the two main\ncases for applying forces to the human skin: perpendicular, and lateral.\nInitial results indicate that the force pulse approach can enable perceivably\nmultidimensional, tangible display of the ongoing grain-generating process.\nMoreover, it was found that this can be made to meaningfully happen (in real\ntime) in the same timescale of basic sonic grain generation.

    "abstract": "We present Ghostfinger, a technology for highly dynamic up/down fingertip\nhaptics and control. The overall user experience offered by the technology can\nbe described as that of tangibly and audibly interacting with a small hologram.\nMore specifically, Ghostfinger implements automatic visualization of the\ndynamic instantiation/parametrization of algorithmic primitives that together\ndetermine the current haptic conditions for fingertip action. Some aspects of\nthis visualization are visuospatial: A floating see-through cursor provides\nreal-time, to-scale display of the fingerpad transducer, as it is being moved\nby the user. Simultaneously, each haptic primitive instance is represented by a\nfloating block shape, type-colored, variably transparent, and possibly\noverlapping with other such block shapes. Further aspects of visualization are\nsymbolic: Each instance is also represented by a type symbol, lighting up\nwithin a grid if the instance is providing output to the user. We discuss the\nsystem's user interface, programming interface, and potential applications.\nThis is done from a general perspective that articulates and emphasizes the\nuniquely enabling role of the principle of computation in the implementation of\nnew forms of instrumental control of musical sound. Beyond the currently\npresented technology, this also reflects more broadly on the role of Digital\nMusical Instruments (DMIs) in NIME.",

    "abstract": "Given a large data graph, trimming techniques can reduce the search space by\nremoving vertices without outgoing edges. One application is to speed up the\nparallel decomposition of graphs into strongly connected components (SCC\ndecomposition), which is a fundamental step for analyzing graphs. We observe\nthat graph trimming is essentially a kind of arc-consistency problem, and AC-3,\nAC-4, and AC-6 are the most relevant arc-consistency algorithms for application\nto graph trimming. The existing parallel graph trimming methods require\nworst-case $\\mathcal O(nm)$ time and worst-case $\\mathcal O(n)$ space for\ngraphs with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. We call these parallel AC-3-based as\nthey are much like the AC-3 algorithm. In this work, we propose AC-4-based and\nAC-6-based trimming methods. That is, AC-4-based trimming has an improved\nworst-case time of $\\mathcal O(n+m)$ but requires worst-case space of $\\mathcal\nO(n+m)$; compared with AC-4-based trimming, AC-6-based has the same worst-case\ntime of $\\mathcal O(n+m)$ but an improved worst-case space of $\\mathcal O(n)$.\nWe parallelize the AC-4-based and AC-6-based algorithms to be suitable for\nshared-memory multi-core machines. The algorithms are designed to minimize\nsynchronization overhead. For these algorithms, we also prove the correctness\nand analyze time complexities with the work-depth model. In experiments, we\ncompare these three parallel trimming algorithms over a variety of real and\nsynthetic graphs. Specifically, for the maximum number of traversed edges per\nworker by using 16 workers, AC-3-based traverses up to 58.3 and 36.5 times more\nedges than AC-6-based trimming and AC-4-based trimming, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Localizing individuals in crowds is more in accordance with the practical\ndemands of subsequent high-level crowd analysis tasks than simply counting.\nHowever, existing localization based methods relying on intermediate\nrepresentations (\\textit{i.e.}, density maps or pseudo boxes) serving as\nlearning targets are counter-intuitive and error-prone. In this paper, we\npropose a purely point-based framework for joint crowd counting and individual\nlocalization. For this framework, instead of merely reporting the absolute\ncounting error at image level, we propose a new metric, called density\nNormalized Average Precision (nAP), to provide more comprehensive and more\nprecise performance evaluation. Moreover, we design an intuitive solution under\nthis framework, which is called Point to Point Network (P2PNet). P2PNet\ndiscards superfluous steps and directly predicts a set of point proposals to\nrepresent heads in an image, being consistent with the human annotation\nresults. By thorough analysis, we reveal the key step towards implementing such\na novel idea is to assign optimal learning targets for these proposals.\nTherefore, we propose to conduct this crucial association in an one-to-one\nmatching manner using the Hungarian algorithm.

    "abstract": "Continuous sign language recognition (cSLR) is a public significant task that\ntranscribes a sign language video into an ordered gloss sequence. It is\nimportant to capture the fine-grained gloss-level details, since there is no\nexplicit alignment between sign video frames and the corresponding glosses.\nAmong the past works, one promising way is to adopt a one-dimensional\nconvolutional network (1D-CNN) to temporally fuse the sequential frames.\nHowever, CNNs are agnostic to similarity or dissimilarity, and thus are unable\nto capture local consistent semantics within temporally neighboring frames. To\naddress the issue, we propose to adaptively fuse local features via temporal\nsimilarity for this task. Specifically, we devise a Multi-scale Local-Temporal\nSimilarity Fusion Network (mLTSF-Net) as follows: 1) In terms of a specific\nvideo frame, we firstly select its similar neighbours with multi-scale\nreceptive regions to accommodate different lengths of glosses. 2) To ensure\ntemporal consistency, we then use position-aware convolution to temporally\nconvolve each scale of selected frames. 3) To obtain a local-temporally\nenhanced frame-wise representation, we finally fuse the results of different\nscales using a content-dependent aggregator.

ARIMA models are frequently used in econometric\nanalyses, providing a good bechmark for the problem under study. Our results\nindicate that ARIMA performs similarly to LSTM neural networks for the problem\nunder study, while the combination of CNNs and LSTMs attains the best overall\naccuracy, but requires more time to be tuned. On the contrary, Prophet is very\nfast to use, but less accurate.",

    "abstract": "Modeling is a key activity in conceptual design and system design. Through\ncollaborative modeling, end-users, stakeholders, experts, and entrepreneurs are\nable to create a shared understanding of a system representation. While the\nUnified Modeling Language (UML) is one of the major conceptual modeling\nlanguages in object-oriented software engineering, more and more concerns arise\nfrom the modeling quality of UML and its tool support. Among them, the\nlimitation of the two-dimensional presentation of its notations and lack of\nnatural collaborative modeling tools are reported to be significant. In this\npaper, we explore the potential of using Virtual Reality (VR) technology for\ncollaborative UML software design by comparing it with classical collaborative\nsoftware design using conventional devices (Desktop PC, Laptop). For this\npurpose, we have developed a VR modeling environment that offers a natural\ncollaborative modeling experience for UML Class Diagrams. Based on a user study\nwith 24 participants, we have compared collaborative VR modeling with\nconventional modeling with regard to efficiency, effectiveness, and user\nsatisfaction. Results show that the use of VR has some disadvantages concerning\nefficiency and effectiveness, but the user's fun, the feeling of being in the\nsame room with a remote collaborator, and the naturalness of collaboration were\nincreased.",

    "abstract": "The smart grid concept has emerged to address the existing problems in the\ntraditional electric grid, which has been functioning for more than a hundred\nyears. The most crucial difference between traditional grids and smart grids is\nthe communication infrastructure applied to the latter. However, coupling\nbetween these networks can increase the risk of significant failures. Hence,\nassessing the performance of the smart grid communication networks is of great\nimportance and thus is considered here. As transmission time and cost play\nessential roles in many real-world communication networks, both time and budget\nconstraints are considered in this work. To evaluate the performance of\ncommunication networks, we assume that the data is transmitted from a source to\na destination through a single path. We propose an algorithm that computes the\nexact probability of transmitting d units of data from the source to the\ndestination within T units of time and the budget of b. The algorithm is\nillustrated through a benchmark network example. The complexity results are\nalso provided. A rather large-size benchmark, that is, Pan European topology,\nalong with one thousand randomly generated test problems are used to generate\nthe experimental results which show clearly the superiority of our proposed\nalgorithms to some existing algorithm in the literature.",

    "abstract": "In this work we create agents that can perform well beyond a single,\nindividual task, that exhibit much wider generalisation of behaviour to a\nmassive, rich space of challenges. We define a universe of tasks within an\nenvironment domain and demonstrate the ability to train agents that are\ngenerally capable across this vast space and beyond. The environment is\nnatively multi-agent, spanning the continuum of competitive, cooperative, and\nindependent games, which are situated within procedurally generated physical 3D\nworlds. The resulting space is exceptionally diverse in terms of the challenges\nposed to agents, and as such, even measuring the learning progress of an agent\nis an open research problem. We propose an iterative notion of improvement\nbetween successive generations of agents, rather than seeking to maximise a\nsingular objective, allowing us to quantify progress despite tasks being\nincomparable in terms of achievable rewards. We show that through constructing\nan open-ended learning process, which dynamically changes the training task\ndistributions and training objectives such that the agent never stops learning,\nwe achieve consistent learning of new behaviours. The resulting agent is able\nto score reward in every one of our humanly solvable evaluation levels, with\nbehaviour generalising to many held-out points in the universe of tasks.\nExamples of this zero-shot generalisation include good performance on Hide and\nSeek, Capture the Flag, and Tag.

Recent work has shown that it is possible to train\ndenoisers on a single noisy image. These models adapt to the features of the\ntest image, but their performance is limited by the small amount of information\nused to train them. Here we propose \"GainTuning\", in which CNN models\npre-trained on large datasets are adaptively and selectively adjusted for\nindividual test images. To avoid overfitting, GainTuning optimizes a single\nmultiplicative scaling parameter (the \"Gain\") of each channel in the\nconvolutional layers of the CNN. We show that GainTuning improves\nstate-of-the-art CNNs on standard image-denoising benchmarks, boosting their\ndenoising performance on nearly every image in a held-out test set. These\nadaptive improvements are even more substantial for test images differing\nsystematically from the training data, either in noise level or image type. We\nillustrate the potential of adaptive denoising in a scientific application, in\nwhich a CNN is trained on synthetic data, and tested on real\ntransmission-electron-microscope images.

    "abstract": "Although high-performance deep neural networks are in high demand in edge\nenvironments, computation resources are strictly limited in edge devices, and\nlight-weight neural network techniques, such as Depthwise Separable Convolution\n(DSC), have been developed. ResNet is one of conventional deep neural network\nmodels that stack a lot of layers and parameters for a higher accuracy. To\nreduce the parameter size of ResNet, by utilizing a similarity to ODE (Ordinary\nDifferential Equation), Neural ODE repeatedly uses most of weight parameters\ninstead of having a lot of different parameters. Thus, Neural ODE becomes\nsignificantly small compared to that of ResNet so that it can be implemented in\nresource-limited edge devices. In this paper, a combination of Neural ODE and\nDSC, called dsODENet, is designed and implemented for FPGAs (Field-Programmable\nGate Arrays). dsODENet is then applied to edge domain adaptation as a practical\nuse case and evaluated with image classification datasets. It is implemented on\nXilinx ZCU104 board and evaluated in terms of domain adaptation accuracy,\ntraining speed, FPGA resource utilization, and speedup rate compared to a\nsoftware execution. The results demonstrate that dsODENet is comparable to or\nslightly better than our baseline Neural ODE implementation in terms of domain\nadaptation accuracy, while the total parameter size without pre- and\npost-processing layers is reduced by 54.2% to 79.8%.

    "title": "Conflict-Free Four-Dimensional Path Planning for Urban Air Mobility  Considering Airspace Occupations",
    "abstract": "Urban air mobility (UAM) has attracted the attention of aircraft\nmanufacturers, air navigation service providers and governments in recent\nyears. Preventing the conflict among urban aircraft is crucial to UAM traffic\nsafety, which is a key in enabling large scale UAM operation. Pre-flight\nconflict-free path planning can provide a strategic layer in the maintenance of\nsafety performance, thus becomes an important element in UAM. This paper aims\nat tackling conflict-free path planning problem for UAM operation with a\nconsideration of four-dimensional airspace management. In the first place, we\nintroduced and extended a four-dimensional airspace management concept,\nAirMatrix. On the basis of AirMatrix, we formulated the shortest flight time\npath planning problem considering resolution of conflicts with both static and\ndynamic obstacles. A Conflict-Free A-Star algorithm was developed for planning\nfour-dimensional paths based on first-come-first-served scheme. The algorithm\ncontains a novel design of heuristic function as well as a conflict detection\nand resolution strategy. Numerical experiment was carried out in Jurong East\narea in Singapore, and the results show that the algorithm can generate paths\nresolving a significant number of potential conflicts in airspace utilization,\nwith acceptable computational time and flight delay. The contributions of this\nstudy provide references for stakeholders to support the development of UAM.",

With the\nidentification of the aforementioned sub-problems, it was possible develop a\ntaxonomic model with the aim of implementing a tool that helps in detecting\nfalse news, identifying if a news is true, false or whether the user must be\ncareful (when it is not possible identify whether the news is true or false).\nAfter implementation, it was possible get a tool that allows you to calculate a\nprobability of a news being false, selected as selected options in each\nparameter.

    "abstract": "We propose a finite element method for simulating one-dimensional solid\nmodels moving and experiencing large deformations while immersed in generalized\nNewtonian fluids. The method is oriented towards applications involving\nmicroscopic devices or organisms in the soft-bio-matter realm. By considering\nthat the strain energy of the solid may explicitly depend on time, we\nincorporate a mechanism for active response. The solids are modeled as Cosserat\nrods, a detailed formulation being provided for the special case of a planar\nnon-shearable rod. The discretization adopts one-dimensional Hermite elements\nfor the rod and low-order Lagrange two-dimensional elements for the fluid's\nvelocity and pressure. The fluid mesh is boundary-fitted, with remeshing at\neach time step. Several time marching schemes are studied, of which a\nsemi-implicit scheme emerges as most effective. The method is demonstrated in\nvery challenging examples: the roll-up of a rod to circular shape and later\nsudden release, the interaction of a soft rod with a fluid jet and the active\nself-locomotion of a sperm-like rod.

    "abstract": "In various applications in the field of control engineering the estimation of\nthe state variables of dynamic systems in the presence of unknown inputs plays\nan important role. Existing methods require the so-called observer matching\ncondition to be satisfied, rely on the boundedness of the state variables or\nexhibit an increased observer order of twice the plant order. In this article,\na novel observer normal form for strongly observable linear time-invariant\nmultivariable systems is proposed. In contrast to classical normal forms, the\nproposed approach also takes the unknown inputs into account. The proposed\nobserver normal form allows for the straightforward construction of a\nhigher-order sliding mode observer, which ensures global convergence of the\nestimation error within finite time even in the presence of unknown bounded\ninputs. Its application is not restricted to systems which satisfy the\naforementioned limitations of already existing unknown input observers. The\nproposed approach can be exploited for the reconstruction of unknown inputs\nwith bounded derivative and robust state-feedback control, which is shown by\nmeans of a tutorial example.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of estimating frame-level full human body meshes\ngiven a video of a person with natural motion dynamics. While much progress in\nthis field has been in single image-based mesh estimation, there has been a\nrecent uptick in efforts to infer mesh dynamics from video given its role in\nalleviating issues such as depth ambiguity and occlusions. However, a key\nlimitation of existing work is the assumption that all the observed motion\ndynamics can be modeled using one dynamical/recurrent model. While this may\nwork well in cases with relatively simplistic dynamics, inference with\nin-the-wild videos presents many challenges. In particular, it is typically the\ncase that different body parts of a person undergo different dynamics in the\nvideo, e.g., legs may move in a way that may be dynamically different from\nhands (e.g., a person dancing). To address these issues, we present a new\nmethod for video mesh recovery that divides the human mesh into several local\nparts following the standard skeletal model. We then model the dynamics of each\nlocal part with separate recurrent models, with each model conditioned\nappropriately based on the known kinematic structure of the human body. This\nresults in a structure-informed local recurrent learning architecture that can\nbe trained in an end-to-end fashion with available annotations. We conduct a\nvariety of experiments on standard video mesh recovery benchmark datasets such\nas Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW, demonstrating the efficacy of our design\nof modeling local dynamics as well as establishing state-of-the-art results\nbased on standard evaluation metrics.",

The autonomous recovery system, which is used to guide the\nsmall UGV back to the carrier vehicle, is an essential component to achieve a\nseamless combination of the two vehicles. This paper proposes a novel\nautonomous recovery framework with a low-cost monocular vision system to\nprovide accurate positioning and attitude estimation of the UGV during\nnavigation. First, we introduce a light-weight convolutional neural network\ncalled UGV-KPNet to detect the keypoints of the small UGV from the images\ncaptured by a monocular camera. UGV-KPNet is computationally efficient with a\nsmall number of parameters and provides pixel-level accurate keypoints\ndetection results in real-time. Then, six degrees of freedom pose is estimated\nusing the detected keypoints to obtain positioning and attitude information of\nthe UGV. Besides, we are the first to create a large-scale real-world keypoints\ndataset of the UGV. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed\nsystem achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both accuracy and\nspeed on UGV keypoint detection, and can further boost the 6-DoF pose\nestimation for the UGV.",

    "abstract": "Recent deep networks have convincingly demonstrated high capability in crowd\ncounting, which is a critical task attracting widespread attention due to its\nvarious industrial applications. Despite such progress, trained data-dependent\nmodels usually can not generalize well to unseen scenarios because of the\ninherent domain shift. To facilitate this issue, this paper proposes a novel\nadversarial scoring network (ASNet) to gradually bridge the gap across domains\nfrom coarse to fine granularity. In specific, at the coarse-grained stage, we\ndesign a dual-discriminator strategy to adapt source domain to be close to the\ntargets from the perspectives of both global and local feature space via\nadversarial learning. The distributions between two domains can thus be aligned\nroughly. At the fine-grained stage, we explore the transferability of source\ncharacteristics by scoring how similar the source samples are to target ones\nfrom multiple levels based on generative probability derived from coarse stage.\nGuided by these hierarchical scores, the transferable source features are\nproperly selected to enhance the knowledge transfer during the adaptation\nprocess. With the coarse-to-fine design, the generalization bottleneck induced\nfrom the domain discrepancy can be effectively alleviated.

    "title": "From Library Portability to Para-rehosting: Natively Executing  Microcontroller Software on Commodity Hardware",
    "abstract": "Finding bugs in microcontroller (MCU) firmware is challenging, even for\ndevice manufacturers who own the source code. The MCU runs different\ninstruction sets than x86 and exposes a very different development environment.\nThis invalidates many existing sophisticated software testing tools on x86. To\nmaintain a unified developing and testing environment, a straightforward way is\nto re-compile the source code into the native executable for a commodity\nmachine (called rehosting). However, ad-hoc re-hosting is a daunting and\ntedious task and subject to many issues (library-dependence, kernel-dependence\nand hardware-dependence). In this work, we systematically explore the\nportability problem of MCU software and propose pararehosting to ease the\nporting process. Specifically, we abstract and implement a portable MCU (PMCU)\nusing the POSIX interface. It models common functions of the MCU cores. For\nperipheral specific logic, we propose HAL-based peripheral function\nreplacement, in which high-level hardware functions are replaced with an\nequivalent backend driver on the host. These backend drivers are invoked by\nwell-designed para-APIs and can be reused across many MCU OSs. We categorize\ncommon HAL functions into four types and implement templates for quick backend\ndevelopment. Using the proposed approach, we have successfully rehosted nine\nMCU OSs including the widely deployed Amazon FreeRTOS, ARM Mbed OS, Zephyr and\nLiteOS. To demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of security\ntesting, we used off-the-shelf dynamic analysis tools (AFL and ASAN) against\nthe rehosted programs and discovered 28 previously-unknown bugs, among which 5\nwere confirmed by CVE and the other 19 were confirmed by vendors at the time of\nwriting.",

    "abstract": "This paper demonstrates that in some cases the safety override arising from\nthe use of a barrier function can be needlessly restrictive. In particular, we\nexamine the case of fixed wing collision avoidance and show that when using a\nbarrier function, there are cases where two fixed wing aircraft can come closer\nto colliding than if there were no barrier function at all. In addition, we\nconstruct cases where the barrier function labels the system as unsafe even\nwhen the vehicles start arbitrarily far apart. In other words, the barrier\nfunction ensures safety but with unnecessary costs to performance. We therefore\nintroduce model free barrier functions which take a data driven approach to\ncreating a barrier function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of model free\nbarrier functions in a collision avoidance simulation of two fixed-wing\naircraft.",

This\ntrend has been due to its characteristics such as its flexibility and\nportability across platforms. The widespread use of PDF has installed a false\nimpression of inherent safety among benign users. However, the characteristics\nof PDF motivated hackers to exploit various types of vulnerabilities, overcome\nsecurity safeguards, thereby making the PDF format one of the most efficient\nmalicious code attack vectors. Therefore, efficiently detecting malicious PDF\nfiles is crucial for information security. Several analysis techniques has been\nproposed in the literature, be it static or dynamic, to extract the main\nfeatures that allow the discrimination of malware files from benign ones. Since\nclassical analysis techniques may be limited in case of zero-days,\nmachine-learning based techniques have emerged recently as an automatic\nPDF-malware detection method that is able to generalize from a set of training\nsamples. These techniques are themselves facing the challenge of evasion\nattacks where a malicious PDF is transformed to look benign. In this work, we\ngive an overview on the PDF-malware detection problem.

While this\noften leads to good predictive performance, it does only help to a limited\ndegree to understand how emotions are communicated in various domains. The\nemotion component process model (CPM) by Scherer (2005) is an interesting\napproach to explain emotion communication. It states that emotions are a\ncoordinated process of various subcomponents, in reaction to an event, namely\nthe subjective feeling, the cognitive appraisal, the expression, a\nphysiological bodily reaction, and a motivational action tendency. We\nhypothesize that these components are associated with linguistic realizations:\nan emotion can be expressed by describing a physiological bodily reaction (\"he\nwas trembling\"), or the expression (\"she smiled\"), etc. We annotate existing\nliterature and Twitter emotion corpora with emotion component classes and find\nthat emotions on Twitter are predominantly expressed by event descriptions or\nsubjective reports of the feeling, while in literature, authors prefer to\ndescribe what characters do, and leave the interpretation to the reader. We\nfurther include the CPM in a multitask learning model and find that this\nsupports the emotion categorization.

Recently, a class of UP programs, called coherent, has been\nproposed and shown to be decidable. We provide an alternative, logical\ncharacterization, of this result. Specifically, we show that every coherent\nprogram is bisimilar to a finite state system. Moreover, an inductive invariant\nof a coherent program is representable by a formula whose terms are of depth at\nmost 1. We also show that the original proof, via automata, only applies to\nprograms over unary uninterpreted functions.

Third, uncertainty quantification of\nthe model parameters and predictions are necessary. The proposed Bayesian\napproach offers a principled way to alleviate the above challenges by marginal\nlikelihood/model evidence approximation and structured group sparsity-inducing\npriors construction. The identification algorithm is derived as an iterative\nregularized optimization procedure that can be solved as efficiently as\ntraining typical DNNs. Furthermore, a practical calculation approach based on\nthe Monte-Carlo integration method is derived to quantify the uncertainty of\nthe parameters and predictions.

Therefore, to\nmaximally bridge this gap, we propose a painting navigation system to assist\nblind people in painting and artistic creation.

The system adopts drawing board\npositioning based on QR code, brush navigation based on target detection and\nbush real-time positioning. Meanwhile, this paper uses human-computer\ninteraction on the basis of voice and a simple but efficient position\ninformation coding rule. In addition, we design a criterion to efficiently\njudge whether the brush reaches the target or not. According to the\nexperimental results, the thermal curves extracted from the faces of testers\nshow that it is relatively well accepted by blindfolded and even blind testers.\nWith the prompt frequency of 1s, the painting navigation system performs best\nwith the completion degree of 89% with SD of 8.37% and overflow degree of 347%\nwith SD of 162.14%. Meanwhile, the excellent and good types of brush tip\ntrajectory account for 74%, and the relative movement distance is 4.21 with SD\nof 2.51. This work demonstrates that it is practicable for the blind people to\nfeel the world through the brush in their hands. In the future, we plan to\ndeploy Angle's Eyes on the phone to make it more portable.

    "abstract": "Novel architectures for deep learning exploit both activation and weight\nsparsity to improve the performance of DNN inference. However, this speedup\nusually brings non-negligible overheads which diminish the efficiency of such\ndesigns when running dense models. These overheads specifically are exacerbated\nfor low precision accelerators with optimized SRAM size per core. This paper\nexamines the design space trade-offs of such accelerators aiming to achieve\ncompetitive performance and efficiency metrics for all four combinations of\ndense or sparse activation/weight tensors. To do so, we systematically examine\noverheads of supporting sparsity on top of an optimized dense core. These\noverheads are modeled based on parameters that indicate how a multiplier can\nborrow a nonzero operation from the neighboring multipliers or future cycles.\nAs a result of this exploration, we identify a few promising designs that\nperform better than prior work. Our findings suggest that even a best design\ntargeting dual sparsity yields 20%-30% drop in power efficiency when performing\non single sparse models, i.e., those with only sparse weight or sparse\nactivation tensors. We introduce novel techniques to reuse resources of the\nsame core to maintain high performance and efficiency when running single\nsparsity or dense models. We call this hybrid design Griffin. Griffin is 1.2,\n3.0, 3.1, and 1.4X more power efficient than state-of-the-art sparse\narchitectures, for dense, weight-only sparse, activation-only sparse, and dual\nsparse models, respectively.",

First, the\nradial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is applied to estimate lumped\ndisturbances, where the weights, centers and widths of the RBFNN are trained\nonline via finite-time gradient descent algorithm. Then, a finite-time\nbackstepping control scheme is constructed to fulfill the tracking control of\nthe elevation and pitch angles. In addition, a hybrid finite-time\ndifferentiator (HFTD) is introduced for approximating the intermediate control\nsignal and its derivative to avoid the problem of \"explosion of complexity\" in\nthe traditional backstepping design protocol. Moreover, the errors caused by\nthe HFTD can be attenuated by the combination of compensation signals.

However, the success of current\nreinforcement learning algorithms is predicated on an often under-emphasised\nrequirement -- each trial needs to start from a fixed initial state\ndistribution. Unfortunately, resetting the environment to its initial state\nafter each trial requires substantial amount of human supervision and extensive\ninstrumentation of the environment which defeats the purpose of autonomous\nreinforcement learning. In this work, we propose Value-accelerated Persistent\nReinforcement Learning (VaPRL), which generates a curriculum of initial states\nsuch that the agent can bootstrap on the success of easier tasks to efficiently\nlearn harder tasks. The agent also learns to reach the initial states proposed\nby the curriculum, minimizing the reliance on human interventions into the\nlearning.

    "abstract": "Code comment generation techniques aim to generate natural language\ndescriptions for source code. There are two orthogonal approaches for this\ntask, i.e., information retrieval (IR) based and neural-based methods. Recent\nstudies have focused on combining their strengths by feeding the input code and\nits similar code snippets retrieved by the IR-based approach to the\nneural-based approach, which can enhance the neural-based approach's ability to\noutput low-frequency words and further improve the performance. However,\ndespite the tremendous progress, our pilot study reveals that the current\ncombination is not generalizable and can lead to performance degradation. In\nthis paper, we propose a straightforward but effective approach to tackle the\nissue of existing combinations of these two comment generation approaches.\nInstead of binding IR- and neural-based approaches statically, we combine them\nin a dynamic manner. Specifically, given an input code snippet, we first use an\nIR-based technique to retrieve a similar code snippet from the corpus. Then we\nuse a Cross-Encoder based classifier to decide the comment generation method to\nbe used dynamically, i.e., if the retrieved similar code snippet is a true\npositive (i.e., is semantically similar to the input), we directly use the\nIR-based technique. Otherwise, we pass the input to the neural-based model to\ngenerate the comment. We evaluate our approach on a large-scale dataset of Java\nprojects. Experiment results show that our approach can achieve 25.45 BLEU\nscore, which improves the state-of-the-art IR-based approach, neural-based\napproach, and their combination by 41%, 26%, and 7%, respectively.

    "abstract": "Validating the safety of autonomous systems generally requires the use of\nhigh-fidelity simulators that adequately capture the variability of real-world\nscenarios. However, it is generally not feasible to exhaustively search the\nspace of simulation scenarios for failures. Adaptive stress testing (AST) is a\nmethod that uses reinforcement learning to find the most likely failure of a\nsystem. AST with a deep reinforcement learning solver has been shown to be\neffective in finding failures across a range of different systems. This\napproach generally involves running many simulations, which can be very\nexpensive when using a high-fidelity simulator. To improve efficiency, we\npresent a method that first finds failures in a low-fidelity simulator. It then\nuses the backward algorithm, which trains a deep neural network policy using a\nsingle expert demonstration, to adapt the low-fidelity failures to\nhigh-fidelity. We have created a series of autonomous vehicle validation case\nstudies that represent some of the ways low-fidelity and high-fidelity\nsimulators can differ, such as time discretization. We demonstrate in a variety\nof case studies that this new AST approach is able to find failures with\nsignificantly fewer high-fidelity simulation steps than are needed when just\nrunning AST directly in high-fidelity.

    "abstract": "Emotion is an inherently subjective psychophysiological human-state and to\nproduce an agreed-upon representation (gold standard) for continuous emotion\nrequires a time-consuming and costly training procedure of multiple human\nannotators. There is strong evidence in the literature that physiological\nsignals are sufficient objective markers for states of emotion, particularly\narousal. In this contribution, we utilise a dataset which includes continuous\nemotion and physiological signals - Heartbeats per Minute (BPM), Electrodermal\nActivity (EDA), and Respiration-rate - captured during a stress induced\nscenario (Trier Social Stress Test). We utilise a Long Short-Term Memory,\nRecurrent Neural Network to explore the benefit of fusing these physiological\nsignals with arousal as the target, learning from various audio, video, and\ntextual based features. We utilise the state-of-the-art MuSe-Toolbox to\nconsider both annotation delay and inter-rater agreement weighting when fusing\nthe target signals. An improvement in Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC)\nis seen across features sets when fusing EDA with arousal, compared to the\narousal only gold standard results. Additionally, BERT-based textual features'\nresults improved for arousal plus all physiological signals, obtaining up to\n.3344 CCC compared to .2118 CCC for arousal only. Multimodal fusion also\nimproves overall CCC with audio plus video features obtaining up to .6157 CCC\nto recognize arousal plus EDA and BPM.",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art neural network architectures continue to scale in size and\ndeliver impressive generalization results, although this comes at the expense\nof limited interpretability. In particular, a key challenge is to determine\nwhen to stop training the model, as this has a significant impact on\ngeneralization. Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) comprise\nhigh-dimensional feature spaces formed by the aggregation of multiple channels,\nwhere analyzing intermediate data representations and the model's evolution can\nbe challenging owing to the curse of dimensionality. We present channel-wise\nDeepNNK (CW-DeepNNK), a novel channel-wise generalization estimate based on\nnon-negative kernel regression (NNK) graphs with which we perform local\npolytope interpolation on low-dimensional channels. This method leads to\ninstance-based interpretability of both the learned data representations and\nthe relationship between channels. Motivated by our observations, we use\nCW-DeepNNK to propose a novel early stopping criterion that (i) does not\nrequire a validation set, (ii) is based on a task performance metric, and (iii)\nallows stopping to be reached at different points for each channel.

    "abstract": "A graph is called a sum graph if its vertices can be labelled by distinct\npositive integers such that there is an edge between two vertices if and only\nif the sum of their labels is the label of another vertex of the graph. Most\npapers on sum graphs consider combinatorial questions like the minimum number\nof isolated vertices that need to be added to a given graph to make it a sum\ngraph. In this paper, we initiate the study of sum graphs from the viewpoint of\ncomputational complexity. Notice that every $n$-vertex sum graph can be\nrepresented by a sorted list of $n$ positive integers where edge queries can be\nanswered in $O(\\log n)$ time. Therefore, limiting the size of the vertex labels\nalso upper-bounds the space complexity of storing the graph in the database.\nWe show that every $n$-vertex, $m$-edge, $d$-degenerate graph can be made a\nsum graph by adding at most $m$ isolated vertices to it, such that the size of\neach vertex label is at most $O(n^2d)$. This enables us to store the graph\nusing $O(m\\log n)$ bits of memory. For sparse graphs (graphs with $O(n)$\nedges), this matches the trivial lower bound of $\\Omega(n\\log n)$. Since planar\ngraphs and forests have constant degeneracy, our result implies an upper bound\nof $O(n^2)$ on their label size. The previously best known upper bound on the\nlabel size of general graphs with the minimum number of isolated vertices was\n$O(4^n)$, due to Kratochv\\'il, Miller & Nguyen. Furthermore, their proof was\nexistential, whereas our labelling can be constructed in polynomial time.",

In\nthis study, we evaluated the effectiveness of our method from three theoretical\nviewpoints: decentralization, scalability, and tamper resistance. We show that\nthe performance of the entire system can be improved because transactions and\nblocks are distributed only inside the domain. We argue that the transaction\nprocessing capacity will increase to 56,000 transactions per second, which is\nas much as that of a VISA credit card system. The capacity is also evaluated by\nmultiplying the number of domains by the average reduction in\ntransaction-processing time due to the increase in block size and reduction in\nthe block-generation-time interval by domain partition. For tamper resistance,\neach domain has evidence of the hysteresis signatures of the other domains in\nthe blockchain. We introduce two types of tamper-resistance-improvement ratios\nas evaluation measures of tamper resistance for a blockchain and theoretically\nexplain how tamper resistance is improved using our cross-referencing method.\nWith our method, tamper resistance improves as the number of domains increases.\nThe proposed system of 1,000 domains are 3-10 times more tamper-resistant than\nthat of 100 domains, and the capacity is 10 times higher.

    "title": "Hamiltonian Operator Inference: Physics-preserving Learning of  Reduced-order Models for Hamiltonian Systems",
    "abstract": "This work presents a nonintrusive physics-preserving method to learn\nreduced-order models (ROMs) of Hamiltonian systems. Traditional intrusive\nprojection-based model reduction approaches utilize symplectic Galerkin\nprojection to construct Hamiltonian reduced models by projecting Hamilton's\nequations of the full model onto a symplectic subspace. This symplectic\nprojection requires complete knowledge about the full model operators and full\naccess to manipulate the computer code. In contrast, the proposed Hamiltonian\noperator inference approach embeds the physics into the operator inference\nframework to develop a data-driven model reduction method that preserves the\nunderlying symplectic structure. Our method exploits knowledge of the\nHamiltonian functional to define and parametrize a Hamiltonian ROM form which\ncan then be learned from data projected via symplectic projectors. The proposed\nmethod is `gray-box' in that it utilizes knowledge of the Hamiltonian structure\nat the partial differential equation level, as well as knowledge of spatially\nlocal components in the system. However, it does not require access to computer\ncode, only data to learn the models. Our numerical results demonstrate\nHamiltonian operator inference on a linear wave equation, the cubic nonlinear\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation, and a nonpolynomial sine-Gordon equation. Accurate\nlong-time predictions far outside the training time interval for nonlinear\nexamples illustrate the generalizability of our learned models.",

There is no\nclear notion of speed of sound, and thus, most of the classical low Mach\napproximation cannot easily be cast in this context.

    "abstract": "The U-Net architecture, built upon the fully convolutional network, has\nproven to be effective in biomedical image segmentation. However, U-Net applies\nskip connections to merge semantically different low- and high-level\nconvolutional features, resulting in not only blurred feature maps, but also\nover- and under-segmented target regions. To address these limitations, we\npropose a simple, yet effective end-to-end depthwise encoder-decoder fully\nconvolutional network architecture, called Sharp U-Net, for binary and\nmulti-class biomedical image segmentation. The key rationale of Sharp U-Net is\nthat instead of applying a plain skip connection, a depthwise convolution of\nthe encoder feature map with a sharpening kernel filter is employed prior to\nmerging the encoder and decoder features, thereby producing a sharpened\nintermediate feature map of the same size as the encoder map. Using this\nsharpening filter layer, we are able to not only fuse semantically less\ndissimilar features, but also to smooth out artifacts throughout the network\nlayers during the early stages of training. Our extensive experiments on six\ndatasets show that the proposed Sharp U-Net model consistently outperforms or\nmatches the recent state-of-the-art baselines in both binary and multi-class\nsegmentation tasks, while adding no extra learnable parameters. Furthermore,\nSharp U-Net outperforms baselines that have more than three times the number of\nlearnable parameters.",

    "abstract": "In this work we propose a new biophysical computational model of brain\nregions relevant to Parkinson's Disease based on local field potential data\ncollected from the brain of marmoset monkeys. Parkinson's disease is a\nneurodegenerative disorder, linked to the death of dopaminergic neurons at the\nsubstantia nigra pars compacta, which affects the normal dynamics of the basal\nganglia-thalamus-cortex neuronal circuit of the brain. Although there are\nmultiple mechanisms underlying the disease, a complete description of those\nmechanisms and molecular pathogenesis are still missing, and there is still no\ncure. To address this gap, computational models that resemble neurobiological\naspects found in animal models have been proposed. In our model, we performed a\ndata-driven approach in which a set of biologically constrained parameters is\noptimised using differential evolution. Evolved models successfully resembled\nsingle-neuron mean firing rates and spectral signatures of local field\npotentials from healthy and parkinsonian marmoset brain data. As far as we are\nconcerned, this is the first computational model of Parkinson's Disease based\non simultaneous electrophysiological recordings from seven brain regions of\nMarmoset monkeys. Results show that the proposed model could facilitate the\ninvestigation of the mechanisms of PD and support the development of techniques\nthat can indicate new therapies.

We aim to train\na unique deep neural network (DNN) potentially performing well on unseen\nmicrophone arrays. The microphone array geometry shapes the network's\nparameters when training on a fixed microphone array, and thus restricts the\ngeneralization of the trained network to another microphone array. To resolve\nthis problem, a single network is trained using data recorded by various\nmicrophone arrays of different geometries. We design three variants of our\nrecently proposed narrowband network to cope with the agnostic number of\nmicrophones. Overall, the goal is to make the network learn the universal\ninformation for speech enhancement that is available for any array geometry,\nrather than learn the one-array-dedicated characteristics. The experiments on\nboth simulated and real room impulse responses (RIR) demonstrate the excellent\nacross-array generalization capability of the proposed networks, in the sense\nthat their performance measures are very close to, or even exceed the network\ntrained with test arrays.

The most popular CNN-based methods are optimised using pixel\nwise loss functions, ignorant of the spatially extended features that\ncharacterise anatomy. Therefore, whilst sharing a high spatial overlap with the\nground truth, inferred CNN-based segmentations can lack coherence, including\nspurious connected components, holes and voids. Such results are implausible,\nviolating anticipated anatomical topology.

In this paper, we\nintroduce a general macroscopic model for the realistic evaluation of RIS\nscattering, based on its decomposition into multiple scattering mechanisms.\nSince state-of-the-art ray models can already efficiently simulate specular\ninteractions (reflection, diffraction) and diffuse scattering, but not\nanomalous reradiation, we complement them with a Huygens principle approach\nimplemented using either an integral formulation, or a simpler\nantenna-array-like formulation. The different scattering mechanisms are\ncombined through a generalization of the Effective Roughness model using a\nsuitable power conservation equation. Notably, multiple reradiation modes can\nbe modeled through the proposed approach. In addition, we validate the overall\nmodel accuracy by benchmarking it against several case studies available in the\nliterature, either based on analytical models, full-wave simulations, or\nexperimental measurements.",

Recent application of deep neural networks\n(DNNs) to connectome-based classification mostly relies on traditional\nconvolutional neural networks using input connectivity matrices on a regular\nEuclidean grid. We propose a graph deep learning framework to incorporate the\nnon-Euclidean information about graph structure for classifying functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)- derived brain networks in major depressive\ndisorder (MDD). We design a novel graph autoencoder (GAE) architecture based on\nthe graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to embed the topological structure and\nnode content of large-sized fMRI networks into low-dimensional latent\nrepresentations. In network construction, we employ the Ledoit-Wolf (LDW)\nshrinkage method to estimate the high-dimensional FC metrics efficiently from\nfMRI data. We consider both supervised and unsupervised approaches for the\ngraph embedded learning. The learned embeddings are then used as feature inputs\nfor a deep fully-connected neural network (FCNN) to discriminate MDD from\nhealthy controls. Evaluated on a resting-state fMRI MDD dataset with 43\nsubjects, results show that the proposed GAE-FCNN model significantly\noutperforms several state-of-the-art DNN methods for brain connectome\nclassification, achieving accuracy of 72.50% using the LDW-FC metrics as node\nfeatures. The graph embeddings of fMRI FC networks learned by the GAE also\nreveal apparent group differences between MDD and HC. Our new framework\ndemonstrates feasibility of learning graph embeddings on brain networks to\nprovide discriminative information for diagnosis of brain disorders.",

On\nthe other hand, Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) technology\nhas been considered as a promising data technology to provide both flight crews\nand ground control staff the necessary information safely and efficiently about\nthe position and velocity of the airplanes in a specific area. In the attempt\nto tackle this problem, we presented in this paper a simplified framework that\ncan support to detect the typical air routes between airports based on ADS-B\ndata. Specifically, the flight traffic will be classified into major groups\nbased on similarity measures, which helps to reduce the number of flight paths\nbetween airports. As a matter of fact, our framework can be taken into account\nto reduce practically the computational cost for air flow optimization and\nevaluate the operational performance. Finally, in order to illustrate the\npotential applications of our proposed framework, an experiment was performed\nusing ADS-B traffic flight data of three different pairs of airports. The\ndetected typical routes between each couple of airports show promising results\nby virtue of combining two indices for measuring the clustering performance and\nincorporating human judgment into the visual inspection.",

    "abstract": "Objective assessment of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans of\nosteoarthritis (OA) can address the limitation of the current OA assessment.\nSegmentation of bone, cartilage, and joint fluid is necessary for the OA\nobjective assessment. Most of the proposed segmentation methods are not\nperforming instance segmentation and suffer from class imbalance problems. This\nstudy deployed Mask R-CNN instance segmentation and improved it (improved-Mask\nR-CNN (iMaskRCNN)) to obtain a more accurate generalized segmentation for\nOA-associated tissues. Training and validation of the method were performed\nusing 500 MRI knees from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) dataset and 97 MRI\nscans of patients with symptomatic hip OA. Three modifications to Mask R-CNN\nyielded the iMaskRCNN: adding a 2nd ROIAligned block, adding an extra decoder\nlayer to the mask-header, and connecting them by a skip connection. The results\nwere assessed using Hausdorff distance, dice score, and coefficients of\nvariation (CoV). The iMaskRCNN led to improved bone and cartilage segmentation\ncompared to Mask RCNN as indicated with the increase in dice score from 95% to\n98% for the femur, 95% to 97% for tibia, 71% to 80% for femoral cartilage, and\n81% to 82% for tibial cartilage. For the effusion detection, dice improved with\niMaskRCNN 72% versus MaskRCNN 71%. The CoV values for effusion detection\nbetween Reader1 and Mask R-CNN (0.33), Reader1 and iMaskRCNN (0.34), Reader2\nand Mask R-CNN (0.22), Reader2 and iMaskRCNN (0.29) are close to CoV between\ntwo readers (0.21), indicating a high agreement between the human readers and\nboth Mask R-CNN and iMaskRCNN. Mask R-CNN and iMaskRCNN can reliably and\nsimultaneously extract different scale articular tissues involved in OA,\nforming the foundation for automated assessment of OA.

    "abstract": "In a 2006 paper, Jan Lorenz observed a curious behaviour in numerical\nsimulations of the Hegselmann-Krause model: Under some circumstances, making\nagents more closed-minded can produce a consensus from a dense configuration of\nopinions which otherwise leads to fragmentation. Suppose one considers initial\nopinions equally spaced on an interval of length $L$. As first observed by\nLorenz, simulations suggest that there are three intervals $[0, L_1)$, $(L_1,\nL_2)$ and $(L_2, L_3)$, with $L_1 \\approx 5.23$, $L_2 \\approx 5.67$ and $L_3\n\\approx 6.84$ such that, when the number of agents is sufficiently large,\nconsensus occurs in the first and third intervals, whereas for the second\ninterval the system fragments into three clusters. In this paper, we prove\nconsensus for $L \\leq 5.2$ and for $L$ sufficiently close to 6. These proofs\ninclude large computations and in principle the set of $L$ for which consensus\ncan be proven using our approach may be extended with the use of more computing\npower. We also prove that the set of $L$ for which consensus occurs is open.\nMoreover, we prove that, when consensus is assured for the equally spaced\nsystems, this in turn implies asymptotic almost sure consensus for the same\nvalues of $L$ when initial opinions are drawn independently and uniformly at\nrandom. We thus conjecture a pair of phase transitions, making precise the\nformulation of Lorenz's \"consensus strikes back\" hypothesis. Our approach makes\nuse of the continuous agent model introduced by Blondel, Hendrickx and\nTsitsiklis. Indeed, one contribution of the paper is to provide a presentation\nof the relationships between the three different models with equally spaced,\nuniformly random and continuous agents, respectively, which is more rigorous\nthan what can be found in the existing literature.",

Without any predefined earthquake-related mechanisms or\nstatistical laws, GPRL's two essentials, convolved information index and\ntransparent link function, seek generic expressions of rules directly from\ndata.
