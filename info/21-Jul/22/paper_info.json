    "title": "Human Perception of Audio Deepfakes",
    "abstract": "The recent emergence of deepfakes, computerized realistic multimedia fakes,\nbrought the detection of manipulated and generated content to the forefront.\nWhile many machine learning models for deepfakes detection have been proposed,\nthe human detection capabilities have remained far less explored. This is of\nspecial importance as human perception differs from machine perception and\ndeepfakes are generally designed to fool the human. So far, this issue has only\nbeen addressed in the area of images and video.\nTo compare the ability of humans and machines in detecting audio deepfakes,\nwe conducted an online gamified experiment in which we asked users to discern\nbonda-fide audio samples from spoofed audio, generated with a variety of\nalgorithms. 200 users competed for 8976 game rounds with an artificial\nintelligence (AI) algorithm trained for audio deepfake detection. With the\ncollected data we found that the machine generally outperforms the humans in\ndetecting audio deepfakes, but that the converse holds for a certain attack\ntype, for which humans are still more accurate. Furthermore, we found that\nyounger participants are on average better at detecting audio deepfakes than\nolder participants, while IT-professionals hold no advantage over laymen. We\nconclude that it is important to combine human and machine knowledge in order\nto improve audio deepfake detection.",

    "title": "Evolutionary Innovation Viewed as Novel Physical Phenomena and  Hierarchical Systems Building",
    "abstract": "In previous work I proposed a framework for thinking about open-ended\nevolution. The framework characterised the basic processes required for\nDarwinian evolution as: (1) the generation of a phenotype from a genetic\ndescription; (2) the evaluation of that phenotype; and (3) the reproduction\nwith variation of successful genotype-phenotypes. My treatment emphasized the\npotential influence of the biotic and abiotic environment, and of the laws of\nphysics/chemistry, on each of these processes. I demonstrated the conditions\nunder which these processes can allow for ongoing exploration of a space of\npossible phenotypes (which I labelled exploratory open-endedness). However,\nthese processes by themselves cannot expand the space of possible phenotypes\nand therefore cannot account for the more interesting and unexpected kinds of\nevolutionary innovation (such as those I labelled expansive and\ntransformational open-endedness). In the previous work I looked at ways in\nwhich expansive and transformational innovations could arise. I proposed\ntransdomain bridges and non-additive compositional systems as two mechanisms by\nwhich these kinds of innovations could arise. In the current paper I wish to\ngeneralise and expand upon these two concepts. I do this by adopting the\nParameter Space-Organisation Space-Action Space (POA) perspective, as suggested\nat in my previous work, and proposing that all evolutionary innovations can be\nviewed as either capturing some novel physical phenomena that had previously\nbeen unused, or as the creation of new persistent systems within the\nenvironment.",

    "abstract": "In migrating production workloads to cloud, enterprises often face the\ndaunting task of evolving monolithic applications toward a microservice\narchitecture. At IBM, we developed a tool called Mono2Micro to assist with this\nchallenging task. Mono2Micro performs spatio-temporal decomposition, leveraging\nwell-defined business use cases and runtime call relations to create\nfunctionally cohesive partitioning of application classes. Our preliminary\nevaluation of Mono2Micro showed promising results. How well does Mono2Micro\nperform against other decomposition techniques, and how do practitioners\nperceive the tool? This paper describes the technical foundations of Mono2Micro\nand presents results to answer these two questions. To answer the first\nquestion, we evaluated Mono2Micro against four existing techniques on a set of\nopen-source and proprietary Java applications and using different metrics to\nassess the quality of decomposition and tool's efficiency. Our results show\nthat Mono2Micro significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in\nspecific metrics well-defined for the problem domain. To answer the second\nquestion, we conducted a survey of twenty-one practitioners in various industry\nroles who have used Mono2Micro. This study highlights several benefits of the\ntool, interesting practitioner perceptions, and scope for further improvements.\nOverall, these results show that Mono2Micro can provide a valuable aid to\npractitioners in creating functionally cohesive and explainable microservice\ndecompositions.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Forbes, Kumar and Saptharishi [CCC, 2016] proved that there exists\nan explicit $d^{O(1)}$-variate and degree $d$ polynomial $P_{d}\\in VNP$ such\nthat if any depth four circuit $C$ of bounded formal degree $d$ which computes\na polynomial of bounded individual degree $O(1)$, that is functionally\nequivalent to $P_d$, then $C$ must have size $2^{\\Omega(\\sqrt{d}\\log{d})}$.\nThe motivation for their work comes from Boolean Circuit Complexity. Based on\na characterization for $ACC^0$ circuits by Yao [FOCS, 1985] and Beigel and\nTarui [CC, 1994], Forbes, Kumar and Saptharishi [CCC, 2016] observed that\nfunctions in $ACC^0$ can also be computed by algebraic\n$\\Sigma\\mathord{\\wedge}\\Sigma\\Pi$ circuits (i.e., circuits of the form -- sums\nof powers of polynomials) of $2^{\\log^{O(1)}n}$ size. Thus they argued that a\n$2^{\\omega(\\log^{O(1)}{n})}$ \"functional\" lower bound for an explicit\npolynomial $Q$ against $\\Sigma\\mathord{\\wedge}\\Sigma\\Pi$ circuits would imply a\nlower bound for the \"corresponding Boolean function\" of $Q$ against non-uniform\n$ACC^0$. In their work, they ask if their lower bound be extended to\n$\\Sigma\\mathord{\\wedge}\\Sigma\\Pi$ circuits.\nIn this paper, for large integers $n$ and $d$ such that $\\omega(\\log^2n)\\leq\nd\\leq n^{0.01}$, we show that any $\\Sigma\\mathord{\\wedge}\\Sigma\\Pi$ circuit of\nbounded individual degree at most $O\\left(\\frac{d}{k^2}\\right)$ that\nfunctionally computes Iterated Matrix Multiplication polynomial $IMM_{n,d}$\n($\\in VP$) over $\\{0,1\\}^{n^2d}$ must have size $n^{\\Omega(k)}$. Since Iterated\nMatrix Multiplication $IMM_{n,d}$ over $\\{0,1\\}^{n^2d}$ is functionally in\n$GapL$, improvement of the afore mentioned lower bound to hold for\nquasipolynomially large values of individual degree would imply a fine-grained\nseparation of $ACC^0$ from $GapL$.",

    "abstract": "We analyze Bitcoin mining from the perspective of a game and propose an\noptimal mining model that maximizes profits of pools and miners. The model is a\ntwo-stage Stackelberg game in which each stage forms a sub-game. In stage I,\npools are the leaders who assign a computing power to be consumed by miners. In\nstage II, miners decide of their power consumption and distribution. They find\nthemselves in a social dilemma in which they must choose between mining in\nsolo, therefore prioritizing their individual preferences, and participating in\na pool for the collective interest. The model relies on a pool protocol based\non a simulated game in which the miners compete for the reward won by the pool.\nThe solutions for the stage I sub-game and the simulated protocol game are\nunique and stable Nash equilibriums while the stage II sub-game leads to a\nstable cooperative equilibrium only when miners choose their strategies\naccording to certain criteria. We conclude that the cooperative optimal mining\nmodel has the potential to favor Bitcoin decentralization and stability.\nMainly, the social dilemma faced by miners together with the balance of\nincentives ensure a certain distribution of the network computing power between\npools and solo miners, while equilibriums in the game solutions provide\nstability to the system.",

In recent\nyears, k Nearest Neighbors (kNN) emerged as a viable solution to this problem.\nDespite its success, kNN is not without its problems.

We propose a neural network, termed kNet, that learns to\nperform kNN. Once trained, we no longer need to store the training data, and\nprocessing a query sample is a simple matter of inference. To use kNet, we\nfirst train a preliminary network on the data set, and then train kNet on the\npenultimate layer of the preliminary network.We find that kNet gives a smooth\napproximation of kNN,and cannot handle the sharp label changes between samples\nthat kNN can exhibit. This indicates that currently kNet is best suited to\napproximate kNN with a fairly large k. Experiments on two data sets show that\nthis is the regime in which kNN works best,and can therefore be replaced by\nkNet.In practice, kNet consistently improve the results of all preliminary\nnetworks, in all label noise regimes, by up to 3%.",

Many of these applications fall into the \"Source-Sink\nMonotone\" framework, a special case of Topkis's monotonic optimization\nframework, which implies that the parametric min cuts are nested. When there is\na single parameter, this property implies that the number of distinct min cuts\nis linear in the number of nodes, which is quite useful for constructing\nalgorithms to identify all possible min cuts.\nWhen there are multiple Source-Sink Monotone parameters and the vector of\nparameters are ordered in the usual vector sense, the resulting min cuts are\nstill nested.

    "abstract": "Business process management systems from various vendors are used by\ncompanies around the globe. Most of these systems allow for the full or partial\nautomation of business processes by ensuring that tasks and data are presented\nto the right person at the right time during process execution. However, almost\nall established BPMS employ the activity-centric process support paradigm, in\nwhich the various forms, i.e., the main way for users to input data into the\nprocess, have to be created by hand. Furthermore, traditional activity-centric\nprocess management systems are limited in their flexibility as all possible\nexecution variants have to be taken into account by the process modeler.\nTherefore, large amounts of research have gone into developing alternative\nprocess support paradigms, with a large focus on enabling more flexibly\nexecutable processes. This article takes one of these paradigms, object-aware\nprocess management, and presents the concepts we developed while researching\nthe possibility of bringing the power and flexibility of non-activity-centric\nprocess support paradigms to the people that matter: the end-users working with\nthe processes. The contribution of this article are the concepts, ideas, and\nlessons learned during the development and evaluation of the PHILharmonicFlows\nruntime user interface, which allows for the generation of an entire user\ninterface, complete with navigation and forms, based on an object-aware process\nmodel. This novel approach allows for the generation of entire information\nsystems, complete with data storage, process logic, and now fully functional\nuser interfaces in a fully generic fashion from data-centric object-aware\nprocess models.",

    "abstract": "Parent selection algorithms (selection schemes) steer populations through a\nproblem's search space, often trading off between exploitation and exploration.\nUnderstanding how selection schemes affect exploitation and exploration within\na search space is crucial to tackling increasingly challenging problems. Here,\nwe introduce an \"exploration diagnostic\" that diagnoses a selection scheme's\ncapacity for search space exploration. We use our exploration diagnostic to\ninvestigate the exploratory capacity of lexicase selection and several of its\nvariants: epsilon lexicase, down-sampled lexicase, cohort lexicase, and\nnovelty-lexicase. We verify that lexicase selection out-explores tournament\nselection, and we show that lexicase selection's exploratory capacity can be\nsensitive to the ratio between population size and the number of test cases\nused for evaluating candidate solutions. Additionally, we find that relaxing\nlexicase's elitism with epsilon lexicase can further improve exploration. Both\ndown-sampling and cohort lexicase -- two techniques for applying random\nsubsampling to test cases -- degrade lexicase's exploratory capacity; however,\nwe find that cohort partitioning better preserves lexicase's exploratory\ncapacity than down-sampling. Finally, we find evidence that novelty-lexicase's\naddition of novelty test cases can degrade lexicase's capacity for exploration.\nOverall, our findings provide hypotheses for further exploration and actionable\ninsights and recommendations for using lexicase selection.

Also, it was the primary\nsource of misinformation dissemination on a large scale, referred to as the\ninfodemic. Therefore, automatic debunking misinformation is a crucial problem.\nTo tackle this problem, we present two COVID-19 related misinformation datasets\non Twitter and propose a misinformation detection system comprising\nnetwork-based and content-based processes based on machine learning algorithms\nand NLP techniques. In the network-based process, we focus on social\nproperties, network characteristics, and users.

The evaluation results on the\nnetwork-based process show the best results for the artificial neural network\nmodel with an F1 score of 88.68%. In the content-based process, our novel\nsimilarity models, which obtained an F1 score of 90.26%, show an improvement in\nthe misinformation classification results compared to the network-based models.\nIn addition, in the text classification models, the best result was achieved\nusing the stacking ensemble-learning model by obtaining an F1 score of 95.18%.\nFurthermore, we test our content-based models on the Constraint@AAAI2021\ndataset, and by getting an F1 score of 94.38%, we improve the baseline results.\nFinally, we develop a fact-checking website called Checkovid that uses each\nprocess to detect misinformative and informative claims in the domain of\nCOVID-19 from different perspectives.",

This area has\nrevealed interesting algorithmic insights into problems, with particular\nsuccess in the design of competitive online algorithms. However, the question\nof improving algorithm running times with predictions has largely been\nunexplored.\nWe take a first step in this direction by combining the idea of\nmachine-learned predictions with the idea of \"warm-starting\" primal-dual\nalgorithms. We consider one of the most important primitives in combinatorial\noptimization: weighted bipartite matching and its generalization to\n$b$-matching. We identify three key challenges when using learned dual\nvariables in a primal-dual algorithm. First, predicted duals may be infeasible,\nso we give an algorithm that efficiently maps predicted infeasible duals to\nnearby feasible solutions. Second, once the duals are feasible, they may not be\noptimal, so we show that they can be used to quickly find an optimal solution.\nFinally, such predictions are useful only if they can be learned, so we show\nthat the problem of learning duals for matching has low sample complexity. We\nvalidate our theoretical findings through experiments on both real and\nsynthetic data. As a result we give a rigorous, practical, and empirically\neffective method to compute bipartite matchings.",

To further\nreduce the communication overhead, the activations/gradients are quantized\nusing 8-bit floating point prior to transmission.

At the heart of this tool is a set of obfuscating knobs, including\nlayer branching, layer widening, selective fusion and schedule pruning, that\nincrease the number of operators, reduce/increase the latency, and number of\ncache and DRAM accesses. A genetic algorithm-based approach is adopted to\norchestrate the combination of obfuscating knobs to achieve the best\nobfuscating effect on the layer sequence and dimension parameters so that the\narchitecture information cannot be successfully extracted. Results on sequence\nobfuscation show that the proposed tool obfuscates a ResNet-18 ImageNet model\nto a totally different architecture (with 44 layer difference) without\naffecting its functionality with only 2% overall latency overhead.

    "abstract": "The search for binary sequences with low peak sidelobe level value represents\na formidable computational problem. To locate better sequences for this\nproblem, we designed a stochastic algorithm that uses two fitness functions. In\nthese fitness functions, the value of the autocorrelation function has a\ndifferent impact on the final fitness value. It is defined with the value of\nthe exponent over the autocorrelation function values. Each function is used in\nthe corresponding optimization phase, and the optimization process switches\nbetween these two phases until the stopping condition is satisfied. The\nproposed algorithm was implemented using the compute unified device\narchitecture and therefore allowed us to exploit the computational power of\ngraphics processing units. This algorithm was tested on sequences with lengths\n$L = 2^m - 1$, for $14 \\le m \\le 20$. From the obtained results it is evident\nthat the usage of two fitness functions improved the efficiency of the\nalgorithm significantly, new-best known solutions were achieved, and the\nachieved PSL values were significantly less than $\\sqrt{L}$.",

Unfortunately, DNNs are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks\nthat affect virtually all state-of-the-art models. These attacks make small\nimperceptible modifications to inputs that are sufficient to induce the DNNs to\nproduce the wrong classification.\nIn this paper we propose a novel, lightweight adversarial correction and/or\ndetection mechanism for image classifiers that relies on undervolting (running\na chip at a voltage that is slightly below its safe margin). We propose using\ncontrolled undervolting of the chip running the inference process in order to\nintroduce a limited number of compute errors. We show that these errors disrupt\nthe adversarial input in a way that can be used either to correct the\nclassification or detect the input as adversarial. We evaluate the proposed\nsolution in an FPGA design and through software simulation. We evaluate 10\nattacks on two popular DNNs and show an average detection rate of 80% to 95%.",

These systems\nare also a good option for handling large-scale, unknown, and dynamic\nenvironments. However, learning in these environments has become a very\nimportant challenge in various applications. These challenges include the\neffect of search space size on learning time, inefficient cooperation among\nagents, and the lack of proper coordination among agents' decisions. Moreover,\nreinforcement learning algorithms may suffer from long convergence time in\nthese problems. In this paper, a communication framework using knowledge\ntransfer concepts is introduced to address such challenges in the herding\nproblem with large state space. To handle the problems of convergence,\nknowledge transfer has been utilized that can significantly increase the\nefficiency of reinforcement learning algorithms. Coordination between the\nagents is carried out through a head agent in each group of agents and a\ncoordinator agent respectively.

    "abstract": "We present Bayesian Controller Fusion (BCF): a hybrid control strategy that\ncombines the strengths of traditional hand-crafted controllers and model-free\ndeep reinforcement learning (RL). BCF thrives in the robotics domain, where\nreliable but suboptimal control priors exist for many tasks, but RL from\nscratch remains unsafe and data-inefficient. By fusing uncertainty-aware\ndistributional outputs from each system, BCF arbitrates control between them,\nexploiting their respective strengths. We study BCF on two real-world robotics\ntasks involving navigation in a vast and long-horizon environment, and a\ncomplex reaching task that involves manipulability maximisation. For both these\ndomains, there exist simple handcrafted controllers that can solve the task at\nhand in a risk-averse manner but do not necessarily exhibit the optimal\nsolution given limitations in analytical modelling, controller miscalibration\nand task variation. As exploration is naturally guided by the prior in the\nearly stages of training, BCF accelerates learning, while substantially\nimproving beyond the performance of the control prior, as the policy gains more\nexperience. More importantly, given the risk-aversity of the control prior, BCF\nensures safe exploration \\emph{and} deployment, where the control prior\nnaturally dominates the action distribution in states unknown to the policy. We\nadditionally show BCF's applicability to the zero-shot sim-to-real setting and\nits ability to deal with out-of-distribution states in the real-world. BCF is a\npromising approach for combining the complementary strengths of deep RL and\ntraditional robotic control, surpassing what either can achieve independently.\nThe code and supplementary video material are made publicly available at\n\\url{https://krishanrana.github.io/bcf}.",

    "abstract": "Transient execution attacks that exploit speculation have raised significant\nconcerns in computer systems. Typically, branch predictors are leveraged to\ntrigger mis-speculation in transient execution attacks. In this work, we\ndemonstrate a new class of speculation-based attack that targets branch\nprediction unit (BPU). We find that speculative resolution of conditional\nbranches (i.e., in nested speculation) alter the states of pattern history\ntable (PHT) in modern processors, which are not restored after the\ncorresponding branches are later squashed. Such characteristic allows attackers\nto exploit BPU as the secret transmitting medium in transient execution\nattacks. To evaluate the discovered vulnerability, we build a novel attack\nframework, BranchSpectre, that enables exfiltration of unintended secrets\nthrough observing speculative PHT updates (in the form of covert and side\nchannels). We further investigate PHT collision mechanism in the history-based\npredictor as well as the branch prediction mode transitions in Intel\nprocessors. Built upon such knowledge, we implement an ultra high-speed covert\nchannel (BranchSpectre-cc) as well as two side channels (i.e., BranchSpectre-v1\nand BranchSpectre-v2) that merely rely on BPU for mis-speculation trigger and\nsecret inference in the speculative domain. Notably, BranchSpectre side\nchannels can take advantage of much simpler code patterns than the ones used in\nSpectre attacks. We present an extensive BranchSpectre code gadget analysis on\na set of popular real-world application code bases followed by a demonstration\nof real-world side channel attack on OpenSSL. The evaluation results show\nsubstantial wider existence and higher exploitability of BranchSpectre code\npatterns in real-world software. Finally, we discuss several secure branch\nprediction mechanisms that can mitigate transient execution attacks exploiting\nmodern branch predictors.",

We build on a previous framework that establishes\ncommunication lower bounds by use of the rank expansion, or the minimum rank of\nany fixed size subset of columns of a matrix, for each of the three matrices\nencoding the bilinear algorithm. This framework provides lower bounds for any\nway of computing a bilinear algorithm, which encompasses a larger space of\nalgorithms than by fixing a particular dependency graph. Nested bilinear\nalgorithms include fast recursive algorithms for convolution, matrix\nmultiplication, and contraction of tensors with symmetry. Two bilinear\nalgorithms can be nested by taking Kronecker products between their encoding\nmatrices. Our main result is a lower bound on the rank expansion of a matrix\nconstructed by a Kronecker product derived from lower bounds on the rank\nexpansion of the Kronecker product's operands. To prove this bound, we map a\nsubset of columns from a submatrix to a 2D grid, collapse them into a dense\ngrid, expand the grid, and use the size of the expanded grid to bound the\nnumber of linearly independent columns of the submatrix.

    "abstract": "Developing video understanding intelligence is quite challenging because it\nrequires holistic integration of images, scripts, and sounds based on natural\nlanguage processing, temporal dependency, and reasoning. Recently, substantial\nattempts have been made on several video datasets with associated question\nanswering (QA) on a large scale. However, existing evaluation metrics for video\nquestion answering (VideoQA) do not provide meaningful analysis. To make\nprogress, we argue that a well-made framework, established on the way humans\nunderstand, is required to explain and evaluate the performance of\nunderstanding in detail. Then we propose a top-down evaluation system for\nVideoQA, based on the cognitive process of humans and story elements: Cognitive\nModules for Evaluation (CogME). CogME is composed of three cognitive modules:\ntargets, contents, and thinking. The interaction among the modules in the\nunderstanding procedure can be expressed in one sentence as follows: \"I\nunderstand the CONTENT of the TARGET through a way of THINKING.\" Each module\nhas sub-components derived from the story elements. We can specify the required\naspects of understanding by annotating the sub-components to individual\nquestions. CogME thus provides a framework for an elaborated specification of\nVideoQA datasets. To examine the suitability of a VideoQA dataset for\nvalidating video understanding intelligence, we evaluated the baseline model of\nthe DramaQA dataset by applying CogME. The evaluation reveals that story\nelements are unevenly reflected in the existing dataset, and the model based on\nthe dataset may cause biased predictions. Although this study has only been\nable to grasp a narrow range of stories, we expect that it offers the first\nstep in considering the cognitive process of humans on the video understanding\nintelligence of humans and AI.",

However, existing pre-trained models lack of causal\nknowledge which prevents today's NLP systems from thinking like humans. In this\npaper, we investigate the problem of injecting causal knowledge into\npre-trained models. There are two fundamental problems: 1) how to collect a\nlarge-scale causal resource from unstructured texts; 2) how to effectively\ninject causal knowledge into pre-trained models. To address these issues, we\npropose CausalBERT, which collects the largest scale of causal resource using\nprecise causal patterns and causal embedding techniques. In addition, we adopt\na regularization-based method to preserve the already learned knowledge with an\nextra regularization term while injecting causal knowledge. Extensive\nexperiments on 7 datasets, including four causal pair classification tasks, two\ncausal QA tasks and a causal inference task, demonstrate that CausalBERT\ncaptures rich causal knowledge and outperforms all pre-trained models-based\nstate-of-the-art methods, achieving a new causal inference benchmark.",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has brought\nembedded systems into focus as major targets for both security analysts and\nmalicious adversaries. Due to the non-standard hardware and diverse software,\nembedded devices present unique challenges to security analysts for the\naccurate analysis of firmware binaries. The diversity in hardware components\nand tight coupling between firmware and hardware makes it hard to perform\ndynamic analysis, which must have the ability to execute firmware code in\nvirtualized environments. However, emulating the large expanse of hardware\nperipherals makes analysts have to frequently modify the emulator for executing\nvarious firmware code in different virtualized environments, greatly limiting\nthe ability of security analysis.\nIn this work, we explore the problem of firmware re-hosting related to the\nreal-time operating system (RTOS). Specifically, developers create a Board\nSupport Package (BSP) and develop device drivers to make that RTOS run on their\nplatform. By providing high-level replacements for BSP routines and device\ndrivers, we can make the minimal modification of the firmware that is to be\nmigrated from its original hardware environment into a virtualized one. We show\nthat an approach capable of offering the ability to execute firmware at scale\nthrough patching firmware in an automated manner without modifying the existing\nemulators. Our approach, called static binary-level porting, first identifies\nthe BSP and device drivers in target firmware, then patches the firmware with\npre-built BSP routines and drivers that can be adapted to the existing\nemulators. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of the proposed method on\nmultiple hardware platforms and firmware samples for security analysis. The\nresult shows that the approach is flexible enough to emulate firmware for\nvulnerability assessment and exploits development.",

In this model, a set of vehicles move in line formation and\ncoordinate functions such as acceleration, braking, and steering using a\ncombination of physical sensing and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) messaging. The\nauthenticity and integrity of the V2V messages are paramount to highway safety.\nFor this reason, recent V2V and V2X standards support the integration of a PKI.\nHowever, a PKI cannot bind a vehicle's digital identity to the vehicle's\nphysical state (location, heading, velocity, etc.). As a result, a vehicle with\nvalid cryptographic credentials can impact the platoon by creating \"ghost\"\nvehicles and injecting false state information.\nIn this paper, we seek to provide the missing link between the physical and\nthe digital world in the context of verifying a vehicle's platoon membership.\nWe focus on the property of following, where vehicles follow each other in a\nclose and coordinated manner. We aim at developing a Proof-of-Following (PoF)\nprotocol that enables a candidate vehicle to prove that it follows a verifier\nwithin the typical platooning distance. The main idea of the proposed PoF\nprotocol is to draw security from the common, but constantly changing\nenvironment experienced by the closely traveling vehicles. We use the\nlarge-scale fading effect of ambient RF signals as a common source of\nrandomness to construct a PoF primitive.

Current machine learning techniques either depend on manually extracted\nfeatures or large and complex deep learning networks which merely utilize the\n1D ECG signal directly. Since intelligent multimodal fusion can perform at the\nstateof-the-art level with an efficient deep network, therefore, in this paper,\nwe propose two computationally efficient multimodal fusion frameworks for ECG\nheart beat classification called Multimodal Image Fusion (MIF) and Multimodal\nFeature Fusion (MFF). At the input of these frameworks, we convert the raw ECG\ndata into three different images using Gramian Angular Field (GAF), Recurrence\nPlot (RP) and Markov Transition Field (MTF). In MIF, we first perform image\nfusion by combining three imaging modalities to create a single image modality\nwhich serves as input to the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In MFF, we\nextracted features from penultimate layer of CNNs and fused them to get unique\nand interdependent information necessary for better performance of classifier.\nThese informational features are finally used to train a Support Vector Machine\n(SVM) classifier for ECG heart-beat classification.

Researchers have proposed various methods to extract\nlow-level and high-level features of music and compute their similarities.\nHowever, low-level features such as cepstrum coefficients have weak relation\nwith the copyright protection of musical pieces. Existing algorithms\nconsidering high-level features fail to detect the case in which two musical\npieces are not quite similar overall, but have some highly similar regions.\nThis paper proposes a new method named MESMF, which innovatively converts the\nmusic plagiarism detection problem into the bipartite graph matching task. It\ncan be solved via the maximum weight matching and edit distances model. We\ndesign several kinds of melody representations and the similarity computation\nmethods according to the music theory. The proposed method can deal with the\nshift, swapping, transposition, and tempo variance problems in music\nplagiarism. It can also effectively pick out the local similar regions from two\nmusical pieces with relatively low global similarity. We collect a new music\nplagiarism dataset from real legally-judged music plagiarism cases and conduct\ndetailed ablation studies. Experimental results prove the excellent performance\nof the proposed algorithm.

    "abstract": "This paper develops tools to quantify the importance of agent interactions\nand its impact on global performance metrics for networks modeled as linear\ntime-invariant systems. We consider Gramian-based performance metrics and\npropose a novel notion of edge centrality that encodes the first-order\nvariation in the metric with respect to the modification of the corresponding\nedge weight, including for those edges not present in the network. The proposed\nedge centrality matrix (ECM) is additive over the set of inputs, i.e., it\ncaptures the specific contribution to each edge's centrality of the presence of\nany given actuator. We provide a full characterization of the ECM structure for\nthe class of directed stem-bud networks, showing that non-zero entries are only\npossible at specific sub/super-diagonals determined by the network size and the\nlength of its bud. We also provide bounds on the value of the trace, trace\ninverse, and log-det of the Gramian before and after single-edge modifications,\nand on the edge-modification weight to ensure the modified network retains\nstability. Simulations show the utility of the proposed edge centrality notion\nand validate our results.",

Hence, this\npaper presents a novel secure UAV-assisted mobile relaying system operating at\nTHz bands for data acquisition from multiple ground user equipments towards a\ndestination. We assume that the UAV-mounted relay may act, besides providing\nrelaying services, as a potential adversary called the untrusted UAV relay. To\nsafeguard end-to-end communications, we present a secure two-phase transmission\nstrategy with cooperative jamming. Then, we formulate an optimization problem\nin terms of a new measure $-$ secrecy energy efficiency (SEE), defined as the\nratio of achievable average secrecy rate to average system power consumption,\nwhich enables us to obtain the best possible security level while taking UAV's\ninherent flight power limitation into account. This optimization problem leads\nto a joint design of key system parameters, including UAV's trajectory and\nvelocity, communication scheduling, and power allocations. Since the formulated\nproblem is a mixed-integer nonconvex optimization and computationally\nintractable, we propose alternative algorithms to solve it efficiently via\ngreedy/sequential block coordinated descent, successive convex approximation,\nand non-linear fractional programming techniques. Numerical results demonstrate\nsignificant SEE performance improvement of our designs when compared to other\nknown benchmarks.",

It raises concerns about FL since input\nleakage contradicts the privacy-preserving intention of using FL. Despite a\nrelatively rich literature on attacks and defenses of input reconstruction in\nHorizontal FL, input leakage and protection in vertical FL starts to draw\nresearcher's attention recently. In this paper, we study how to defend against\ninput leakage attacks in Vertical FL. We design an adversarial training-based\nframework that contains three modules: adversarial reconstruction, noise\nregularization, and distance correlation minimization. Those modules can not\nonly be employed individually but also applied together since they are\nindependent to each other. Through extensive experiments on a large-scale\nindustrial online advertising dataset, we show our framework is effective in\nprotecting input privacy while retaining the model utility.",

    "abstract": "Detecting 3D landmarks on cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is crucial to\nassessing and quantifying the anatomical abnormalities in 3D cephalometric\nanalysis. However, the current methods are time-consuming and suffer from large\nbiases in landmark localization, leading to unreliable diagnosis results. In\nthis work, we propose a novel Structure-Aware Long Short-Term Memory framework\n(SA-LSTM) for efficient and accurate 3D landmark detection. To reduce the\ncomputational burden, SA-LSTM is designed in two stages. It first locates the\ncoarse landmarks via heatmap regression on a down-sampled CBCT volume and then\nprogressively refines landmarks by attentive offset regression using\nhigh-resolution cropped patches. To boost accuracy, SA-LSTM captures\nglobal-local dependence among the cropping patches via self-attention.\nSpecifically, a graph attention module implicitly encodes the landmark's global\nstructure to rationalize the predicted position. Furthermore, a novel\nattention-gated module recursively filters irrelevant local features and\nmaintains high-confident local predictions for aggregating the final result.\nExperiments show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods in terms of efficiency and accuracy on an in-house dataset and a public\ndataset, achieving 1.64 mm and 2.37 mm average errors, respectively, and using\nonly 0.5 seconds for inferring the whole CBCT volume of resolution 768*768*576.\nMoreover, all predicted landmarks are within 8 mm error, which is vital for\nacceptable cephalometric analysis.",

We propose a\nclassifier capable of extracting underlying features and introducing\nnon-linearity to the data to handle the complex decision boundaries. A novel\nneural network model has been developed where the input features are subjected\nto two transformations adapted from multi-label functional link artificial\nneural network and autoencoders. First, a functional expansion of the original\nfeatures are made using basis functions. This is followed by an\nautoencoder-aided transformation and reduction on the expanded features. This\nnetwork is capable of improving separability for the multi-label data owing to\nthe two-layer transformation while reducing the expanded feature space to a\nmore manageable amount. This balances the input dimension which leads to a\nbetter classification performance even for a limited amount of data. The\nproposed network has been validated on five ML datasets which shows its\nsuperior performance in comparison with six well-established ML classifiers.\nFurthermore, a single-label variation of the proposed network has also been\nformulated simultaneously and tested on four relevant datasets against three\nexisting classifiers to establish its effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is an emerging new domain in which\na set of processes and tools allow humans to better comprehend the decisions\ngenerated by black box models. However, most of the available XAI tools are\noften limited to simple explanations mainly quantifying the impact of\nindividual features to the models' output. Therefore, human users are not able\nto understand how the features are related to each other to make predictions,\nwhereas the inner workings of the trained models remain hidden. This paper\ncontributes to the development of a novel graphical explainability tool that\nnot only indicates the significant features of the model but also reveals the\nconditional relationships between features and the inference capturing both the\ndirect and indirect impact of features to the models' decision. The proposed\nXAI methodology, termed as gLIME, provides graphical model-agnostic\nexplanations either at the global (for the entire dataset) or the local scale\n(for specific data points). It relies on a combination of local interpretable\nmodel-agnostic explanations (LIME) with graphical least absolute shrinkage and\nselection operator (GLASSO) producing undirected Gaussian graphical models.\nRegularization is adopted to shrink small partial correlation coefficients to\nzero providing sparser and more interpretable graphical explanations. Two\nwell-known classification datasets (BIOPSY and OAI) were selected to confirm\nthe superiority of gLIME over LIME in terms of both robustness and consistency\nover multiple permutations. Specifically, gLIME accomplished increased\nstability over the two datasets with respect to features' importance (76%-96%\ncompared to 52%-77% using LIME). gLIME demonstrates a unique potential to\nextend the functionality of the current state-of-the-art in XAI by providing\ninformative graphically given explanations that could unlock black boxes.",

    "abstract": "An important property of concurrent objects is whether they support progress\n-a special case of liveness-guarantees, which ensure the termination of\nindividual method calls under system fairness assumptions. Liveness properties\nhave been proposed for concurrent objects. Typical liveness properties\nincludelock-freedom,wait-freedom,deadlock-freedom,starvation-freedom and\nobstruction-freedom. It is known that the five liveness properties above are\ndecidable on the Sequential Consistency (SC) memory model for a bounded number\nof processes. However, the problem of decidability of liveness for finite state\nconcurrent programs running on relaxed memory models remains open. In this\npaper we address this problem for the Total Store Order (TSO) memory model,as\nfound in the x86 architecture. We prove that lock-freedom,\nwait-freedom,deadlock-freedom and starvation-freedom are undecidable on TSO for\na bounded number of processes, while obstruction-freedom is decidable.",

    "abstract": "Due to the power consumption and high circuit cost in antenna arrays, the\npractical application of massive multipleinput multiple-output (MIMO) in the\nsixth generation (6G) and future wireless networks is still challenging.\nEmploying lowresolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and hybrid analog\nand digital (HAD) structure is two low-cost choice with acceptable performance\nloss. In this paper, the combination of the mixedADC architecture and HAD\nstructure employed at receiver is proposed for direction of arrival (DOA)\nestimation, which will be applied to the beamforming tracking and alignment in\n6G. By adopting the additive quantization noise model, the exact closedform\nexpression of the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the HAD architecture with\nmixed-ADCs is derived. Moreover, the closed-form expression of the performance\nloss factor is derived as a benchmark. In addition, to take power consumption\ninto account, energy efficiency is also investigated in our paper. The\nnumerical results reveal that the HAD structure with mixedADCs can\nsignificantly reduce the power consumption and hardware cost. Furthermore, that\narchitecture is able to achieve a better trade-off between the performance loss\nand the power consumption.

We empirically evaluated the tool's\nprediction performance on about 30,000 GitHub issues.

    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks by generating examples which are almost indistinguishable\nfrom natural examples, pose a serious threat to learning models. Defending\nagainst adversarial attacks is a critical element for a reliable learning\nsystem. Support vector machine (SVM) is a classical yet still important\nlearning algorithm even in the current deep learning era. Although a wide range\nof researches have been done in recent years to improve the adversarial\nrobustness of learning models, but most of them are limited to deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs) and the work for kernel SVM is still vacant. In this paper, we\naim at kernel SVM and propose adv-SVM to improve its adversarial robustness via\nadversarial training, which has been demonstrated to be the most promising\ndefense techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that\ndevotes to the fast and scalable adversarial training of kernel SVM.\nSpecifically, we first build connection of perturbations of samples between\noriginal and kernel spaces, and then give a reduced and equivalent formulation\nof adversarial training of kernel SVM based on the connection. Next, doubly\nstochastic gradients (DSG) based on two unbiased stochastic approximations\n(i.e., one is on training points and another is on random features) are applied\nto update the solution of our objective function. Finally, we prove that our\nalgorithm optimized by DSG converges to the optimal solution at the rate of\nO(1/t) under the constant and diminishing stepsizes. Comprehensive experimental\nresults show that our adversarial training algorithm enjoys robustness against\nvarious attacks and meanwhile has the similar efficiency and scalability with\nclassical DSG algorithm.",

This work explores the word rank dynamics of eight\nlanguages by investigating the Google Books corpus unigram frequency data set.\nWe observed the rank changes of the unigrams from 1900 to 2008 and compared it\nto a Wright-Fisher inspired model that we developed for our analysis. The model\nsimulates a neutral evolutionary process with the restriction of having no\ndisappearing words. This work explains the mathematical framework of the model\n- written as a Markov Chain with multinomial transition probabilities - to show\nhow frequencies of words change in time. From our observations in the data and\nour model, word rank stability shows two types of characteristics: (1) the\nincrease/decrease in ranks are monotonic, or (2) the average rank stays the\nsame. Based on our model, high-ranked words tend to be more stable while\nlow-ranked words tend to be more volatile. Some words change in ranks in two\nways: (a) by an accumulation of small increasing/decreasing rank changes in\ntime and (b) by shocks of increase/decrease in ranks. Most of the stopwords and\nSwadesh words are observed to be stable in ranks across eight languages. These\nsignatures suggest unigram frequencies in all languages have changed in a\nmanner inconsistent with a purely neutral evolutionary process.",

While performance keeps improving,\nseveral limitations exist particularly attributed to difficulties at capturing\nmultimodal supports and to the ability to approximate the underlying\ndistribution closer to the tails, i.e. the boundary of the distribution's\nsupport. This paper proposes an approach that attempts to alleviate such\nshortcomings. We propose an invertible-residual-network-based model, the\nBoundary of Distribution Support Generator (BDSG). GANs generally do not\nguarantee the existence of a probability distribution and here, we use the\nrecently developed Invertible Residual Network (IResNet) and Residual Flow\n(ResFlow), for density estimation. These models have not yet been used for\nanomaly detection. We leverage IResNet and ResFlow for Out-of-Distribution\n(OoD) sample detection and for sample generation on the boundary using a\ncompound loss function that forces the samples to lie on the boundary. The BDSG\naddresses non-convex support, disjoint components, and multimodal\ndistributions.

However, challenges exist for temporal data representation.\nWe therefore sought to identify these challenges and evaluate novel\nmethodologies for addressing them through a systematic examination of deep\nlearning solutions.\nMethods: We searched five databases (PubMed, EMBASE, the Institute of\nElectrical and Electronics Engineers [IEEE] Xplore Digital Library, the\nAssociation for Computing Machinery [ACM] digital library, and Web of Science)\ncomplemented with hand-searching in several prestigious computer science\nconference proceedings. We sought articles that reported deep learning\nmethodologies on temporal data representation in structured EHR data from\nJanuary 1, 2010, to August 30, 2020. We summarized and analyzed the selected\narticles from three perspectives: nature of time series, methodology, and model\nimplementation.\nResults: We included 98 articles related to temporal data representation\nusing deep learning. Four major challenges were identified, including data\nirregularity, data heterogeneity, data sparsity, and model opacity. We then\nstudied how deep learning techniques were applied to address these challenges.\nFinally, we discuss some open challenges arising from deep learning.\nConclusion: Temporal EHR data present several major challenges for clinical\nprediction modeling and data utilization. To some extent, current deep learning\nsolutions can address these challenges. Future studies can consider designing\ncomprehensive and integrated solutions.

However, existing GUIs for querying large\nnetworks either do not expose any canned patterns or if they do then they are\ntypically selected manually based on domain knowledge. Unfortunately, manual\ngeneration of canned patterns is not only labor intensive but may also lack\ndiversity for supporting efficient visual formulation of a wide range of\nsubgraph queries. In this paper, we present a novel generic and extensible\nframework called TATTOO that takes a data-driven approach to automatically\nselecting canned patterns for a GUI from large networks. Specifically, it first\ndecomposes the underlying network into truss-infested and truss-oblivious\nregions. Then candidate canned patterns capturing different real-world query\ntopologies are generated from these regions. Canned patterns based on a\nuser-specified plug are then selected for the GUI from these candidates by\nmaximizing coverage and diversity, and by minimizing the cognitive load of the\npattern set.

    "abstract": "Coordination in multi-agent systems is challenging for agile robots such as\nunmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), where relative agent positions frequently\nchange due to unconstrained movement. The problem is exacerbated through the\nindividual take-off and landing of agents for battery recharging leading to a\nvarying number of active agents throughout the whole mission. This work\nproposes autonomous hierarchical multi-level clustering (MLC), which forms a\nclustering hierarchy utilizing decentralized methods. Through periodic cluster\nmaintenance executed by cluster-heads, stable multi-level clustering is\nachieved. The resulting hierarchy is used as a backbone to solve the\ncommunication problem for locally-interactive applications such as UAV tracking\nproblems. Using observation aggregation, compression, and dissemination, agents\nshare local observations throughout the hierarchy, giving every agent a total\nsystem belief with spatially dependent resolution and freshness. Extensive\nsimulations show that MLC yields a stable cluster hierarchy under different\nmotion patterns and that the proposed belief sharing is highly applicable in\nwildfire front monitoring scenarios.",

    "abstract": "[Context:] Causal relations (e.g., If A, then B) are prevalent in functional\nrequirements. For various applications of AI4RE, e.g., the automatic derivation\nof suitable test cases from requirements, automatically extracting such causal\nstatements are a basic necessity. [Problem:] We lack an approach that is able\nto extract causal relations from natural language requirements in fine-grained\nform. Specifically, existing approaches do not consider the combinatorics\nbetween causes and effects. They also do not allow to split causes and effects\ninto more granular text fragments (e.g., variable and condition), making the\nextracted relations unsuitable for automatic test case derivation. [Objective &\nContributions:] We address this research gap and make the following\ncontributions: First, we present the Causality Treebank, which is the first\ncorpus of fully labeled binary parse trees representing the composition of\n1,571 causal requirements. Second, we propose a fine-grained causality\nextractor based on Recursive Neural Tensor Networks. Our approach is capable of\nrecovering the composition of causal statements written in natural language and\nachieves a F1 score of 74 % in the evaluation on the Causality Treebank. Third,\nwe disclose our open data sets as well as our code to foster the discourse on\nthe automatic extraction of causality in the RE community.",

In order for such robots to be operated\neffectively and efficiently by non-technical users, it is important to examine\nif and how the robotic system's level of automation (LOA) impacts their\nperformance. The objective of this work was to develop suitable LOA modes for a\nmobile robotic telepresence (MRP) system for eldercare and assess their\ninfluence on users' performance, workload, awareness of the environment and\nusability at two different levels of task complexity. For this purpose, two LOA\nmodes were implemented on the MRP platform: assisted teleoperation (low LOA\nmode) and autonomous navigation (high LOA mode). The system was evaluated in a\nuser study with 20 participants, who, in the role of the caregiver, navigated\nthe robot through a home-like environment to perform various control and\nperception tasks. Results revealed that performance improved at high LOA when\nthe task complexity was low. However, when task complexity increased, lower LOA\nimproved performance.

Within this scope, MarsExplorer, an openai-gym compatible\nenvironment tailored to exploration/coverage of unknown areas, is presented.\nMarsExplorer translates the original robotics problem into a Reinforcement\nLearning setup that various off-the-shelf algorithms can tackle. Any learned\npolicy can be straightforwardly applied to a robotic platform without an\nelaborate simulation model of the robot's dynamics to apply a different\nlearning/adaptation phase. One of its core features is the controllable\nmulti-dimensional procedural generation of terrains, which is the key for\nproducing policies with strong generalization capabilities. Four different\nstate-of-the-art RL algorithms (A3C, PPO, Rainbow, and SAC) are trained on the\nMarsExplorer environment, and a proper evaluation of their results compared to\nthe average human-level performance is reported. In the follow-up experimental\nanalysis, the effect of the multi-dimensional difficulty setting on the\nlearning capabilities of the best-performing algorithm (PPO) is analyzed. A\nmilestone result is the generation of an exploration policy that follows the\nHilbert curve without providing this information to the environment or\nrewarding directly or indirectly Hilbert-curve-like trajectories. The\nexperimental analysis is concluded by comparing PPO learned policy results with\nfrontier-based exploration context for extended terrain sizes.

Recently, there is a growing trend towards the\nexecution of compute-intensive FaaS functions that run for several seconds.\nHowever, due to the billing policies followed by commercial FaaS offerings, the\nexecution of these functions can incur significantly higher costs. Moreover,\ndue to the abstraction of underlying processor architectures on which the\nfunctions are executed, the performance optimization of these functions is\nchallenging. As a result, most FaaS functions use pre-compiled libraries\ngeneric to x86-64 leading to performance degradation. In this paper, we examine\nthe underlying processor architectures for Google Cloud Functions (GCF) and\ndetermine their prevalence across the 19 available GCF regions. We modify,\nadapt, and optimize three compute-intensive FaaS workloads written in Python\nusing Numba, a JIT compiler based on LLVM, and present results wrt performance,\nmemory consumption, and costs on GCF. Results from our experiments show that\nthe optimization of FaaS functions can improve performance by 12.8x (geometric\nmean) and save costs by 73.4% on average for the three functions.

    "abstract": "The multi-period dynamics of energy storage (ES), intermittent renewable\ngeneration and uncontrollable power loads, make the optimization of power\nsystem operation (PSO) challenging. A multi-period optimal PSO under\nuncertainty is formulated using the chance-constrained optimization (CCO)\nmodeling paradigm, where the constraints include the nonlinear energy storage\nand AC power flow models. Based on the emerging scenario optimization method\nwhich does not rely on pre-known probability distribution functions, this paper\ndevelops a novel solution method for this challenging CCO problem. The proposed\nmeth-od is computationally effective for mainly two reasons. First, the\noriginal AC power flow constraints are approximated by a set of\nlearning-assisted quadratic convex inequalities based on a generalized least\nabsolute shrinkage and selection operator. Second, considering the physical\npatterns of data and motived by learning-based sampling, the strategic sampling\nmethod is developed to significantly reduce the required number of scenarios\nthrough different sampling strategies. The simulation results on IEEE standard\nsystems indicate that 1) the proposed strategic sampling significantly improves\nthe computational efficiency of the scenario-based approach for solving the\nchance-constrained optimal PSO problem, 2) the data-driven convex approximation\nof power flow can be promising alternatives of nonlinear and nonconvex AC power\nflow.",

The introduced scheme\nmaintains the advantages of the Lagrange--Galerkin method, i.e., CFL-free\nrobustness for convection-dominated problems and a symmetric and positive\ncoefficient matrix resulting from the discretization. In addition, the scheme\nconserves the mass on the discrete level. Unconditional stability and error\nestimates of second order in time are proved by employing two new key lemmas on\nthe truncation error of the material derivative in conservative form and on a\ndiscrete Gronwall inequality for multistep methods. The mass-conservation\nproperty is achieved by the Jacobian multiplication technique introduced by Rui\nand Tabata in 2010, and the accuracy of second order in time is obtained based\non the idea of the multistep Galerkin method along characteristics originally\nintroduced by Ewing and Russel in 1981.

    "abstract": "We consider the task of feature selection for reconstruction which consists\nin choosing a small subset of features from which whole data instances can be\nreconstructed. This is of particular importance in several contexts involving\nfor example costly physical measurements, sensor placement or information\ncompression. To break the intrinsic combinatorial nature of this problem, we\nformulate the task as optimizing a binary mask distribution enabling an\naccurate reconstruction. We then face two main challenges. One concerns\ndifferentiability issues due to the binary distribution. The second one\ncorresponds to the elimination of redundant information by selecting variables\nin a correlated fashion which requires modeling the covariance of the binary\ndistribution. We address both issues by introducing a relaxation of the problem\nvia a novel reparameterization of the logitNormal distribution. We demonstrate\nthat the proposed method provides an effective exploration scheme and leads to\nefficient feature selection for reconstruction through evaluation on several\nhigh dimensional image benchmarks. We show that the method leverages the\nintrinsic geometry of the data, facilitating reconstruction.",

We apply this method to Protein- Protein Interaction\nnetworks, where vertices correspond to proteins, partitioned according to they\nfunctional role, and edges represent potential interactions between proteins.\nSimilarly to other classical and well consolidated approaches, our method\ncompares the relative edge density of the subgraphs induced by each class with\nthe corresponding expected relative edge density under a null model. The\nnovelty of our approach consists in prescribing an endogenous null model,\nnamely, the sample space of the null model is built on the input network\nitself. This allows us to give exact explicit expression for the z-score of the\nrelative edge density of each class as well as other related statistics. The\nz-scores directly quantify the statistical significance of the observed\nhomophily via \\v{C}eby\\v{s}\\\"ev inequality. The expression of each z-score is\nentered by the network structure through basic combinatorial invariant such as\nthe number of subgraphs with two spanning edges. Each z-score is computed in\nO(n 3 ) worst-case time for a network with n vertices. This leads to an overall\neffective computational method for assesing homophily.

Adversaries may\nuse advanced transformation tools to trigger a spoofing attack using fraudulent\nbiometrics for a legitimate speaker. Conversely, such techniques have been used\nto generate privacy-transformed speech by suppressing personally identifiable\nattributes in the voice signals, achieving anonymization. Prior works have\nstudied the security and privacy vectors in parallel, and thus it raises alarm\nthat if a benign user can achieve privacy by a transformation, it also means\nthat a malicious user can break security by bypassing the anti-spoofing\nmechanism. In this paper, we take a step towards balancing two seemingly\nconflicting requirements: security and privacy. It remains unclear what the\nvulnerabilities in one domain imply for the other, and what dynamic\ninteractions exist between them. A better understanding of these aspects is\ncrucial for assessing and mitigating vulnerabilities inherent with VUIs and\nbuilding effective defenses. In this paper,(i) we investigate the applicability\nof the current voice anonymization methods by deploying a tandem framework that\njointly combines anti-spoofing and authentication models, and evaluate the\nperformance of these methods;(ii) examining analytical and empirical evidence,\nwe reveal a duality between the two mechanisms as they offer different ways to\nachieve the same objective, and we show that leveraging one vector\nsignificantly amplifies the effectiveness of the other;(iii) we demonstrate\nthat to effectively defend from potential attacks against VUIs, it is necessary\nto investigate the attacks from multiple complementary perspectives(security\nand privacy).",

In addition, they are agnostic to object scales, thus\nredundantly process all image regions at the same resolution. In this work we\nintroduce BLT-net, a new low-computation two-stage object detection\narchitecture designed to process images with a significant amount of background\nand objects of variate scales. BLT-net reduces computations by separating\nobjects from background using a very lite first-stage. BLT-net then efficiently\nmerges obtained proposals to further decrease processed background and then\ndynamically reduces their resolution to minimize computations. Resulting image\nproposals are then processed in the second-stage by a highly accurate model. We\ndemonstrate our architecture on the pedestrian detection problem, where objects\nare of different sizes, images are of high resolution and object detection is\nrequired to run in real-time. We show that our design reduces computations by a\nfactor of x4-x7 on the Citypersons and Caltech datasets with respect to leading\npedestrian detectors, on account of a small accuracy degradation.

We first surveyed 67 practitioners and found that securing\nmicroservices systems is a unique challenge and that having access to security\ndiscussions is useful for making security decisions. The survey also confirms\nthe usefulness of potential tools that can automatically identify such security\ndiscussions. We developed fifteen machine/deep learning models to automatically\nidentify security discussions. We applied these models on a manually\nconstructed dataset consisting of 4,813 security discussions and 12,464\nnon-security discussions. We found that all the models can effectively identify\nsecurity discussions: an average precision of 84.86%, recall of 72.80%,\nF1-score of 77.89%, AUC of 83.75% and G-mean 82.77%. DeepM1, a deep learning\nmodel, performs the best, achieving above 84% in all metrics and significantly\noutperforms three baselines.

This work fills this gap. For the first time, we\ndeeply study numerous strategies to perform video forecasting in\nmulti-prediction spaces and fuse their results together to boost performance.\nThe prediction in the pixel space usually lacks the ability to preserve the\nsemantic and structure content of the video however the prediction in the\nhigh-level feature space is prone to generate errors in the reduction and\nrecovering process. Therefore, we build a recurrent connection between\ndifferent feature spaces and incorporate their generations in the upsampling\nprocess.

This is\na four-layered ontological architecture, which considers Foundational, Core,\nDomain and Instance levels. In turn, the domain level is split down in two\nsub-levels, namely: Top-domain and Low-domain ontological levels. So in fact,\nwe can consider it to be a five-tier architecture. Ontologies at the same level\ncan be related to each other, except for the foundational level where only\nThingFO (Thing Foundational Ontology) is found. In addition, ontologies' terms\nand relationships at lower levels can be semantically enriched by ontologies'\nterms and relationships from the higher levels. Note that both ThingFO and\nontologies at the core level such as SituationCO, ProcessCO, among others, are\ndomain independent. SituationCO's terms and relationships are specialized\nprimarily from ThingFO. It also completely reuses terms primarily from\nProcessCO, ProjectCO and GoalCO ontologies. Stereotypes are the used mechanism\nfor enriching SituationCO terms. Note that in the end of this document, we\naddress the SituationCO vs. ThingFO non-taxonomic relationship verification\nmatrix.",

    "abstract": "Subgraphs such as cliques, loops and stars form crucial connections in the\ntopologies of real-world networks. Random graph models provide estimates for\nhow often certain subgraphs appear, which in turn can be tested against\nreal-world networks. These subgraph counts, however, crucially depend on the\nassumed degree distribution. Fitting a degree distribution to network data is\nchallenging, in particular for scale-free networks with power-law degrees. In\nthis paper we develop robust subgraph counts that do not depend on the entire\ndegree distribution, but only on the mean and mean absolute deviation (MAD),\nsummary statistics that are easy to obtain for most real-world networks. By\nsolving an optimization problem, we provide tight (the sharpest possible)\nbounds for the subgraph counts, for all possible subgraphs, and for all\nnetworks with degree distributions that share the same mean and MAD. We\nidentify the extremal random graph that attains the tight bounds as the graph\nwith a specific three-point degree distribution. We leverage the bounds to\nobtain robust scaling laws for how the numbers of subgraphs grow as function of\nthe network size. The scaling laws indicate that sparse power-law networks are\nnot the most extreme networks in terms of subgraph counts, but dense power-law\nnetworks are. The robust bounds are also shown to hold for several real-world\ndata sets.",

While much of the existing work has studied\ncompliance as a static behavior, we propose a game-theoretic model to study\ncompliance as dynamic behavior that may change over time. In rounds, a social\nplanner interacts with a sequence of heterogeneous agents who arrive with their\nunobserved private type that determines both their prior preferences across the\nactions (e.g., control and treatment) and their baseline rewards without taking\nany treatment. The planner provides each agent with a randomized recommendation\nthat may alter their beliefs and their action selection. We develop a novel\nrecommendation mechanism that views the planner's recommendation as a form of\ninstrumental variable (IV) that only affects an agents' action selection, but\nnot the observed rewards. We construct such IVs by carefully mapping the\nhistory -- the interactions between the planner and the previous agents -- to a\nrandom recommendation. Even though the initial agents may be completely\nnon-compliant, our mechanism can incentivize compliance over time, thereby\nenabling the estimation of the treatment effect of each treatment, and\nminimizing the cumulative regret of the planner whose goal is to identify the\noptimal treatment.",

    "abstract": "Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is a promising cryptographic mechanism for\nproviding confidentiality and fine-grained access control in the cloud-based\narea. However, due to high computational overhead, common ABE schemes are not\nsuitable for resource-constrained devices. Moreover, data owners should be able\nto update their defined access policies efficiently, and in some cases,\napplying hidden access policies is required to preserve the privacy of clients\nand data. In this paper, we propose a ciphertext-policy attribute-based access\ncontrol scheme which for the first time provides online/offline encryption,\nhidden access policy, and access policy update simultaneously. In our scheme,\nresource-constrained devices are equipped with online/offline encryption\nreducing the encryption overhead significantly. Furthermore, attributes of\naccess policies are hidden such that the attribute sets satisfying an access\npolicy cannot be guessed by other parties. Moreover, data owners can update\ntheir defined access policies while outsourcing a major part of the updating\nprocess to the cloud service provider. In particular, we introduce blind access\npolicies that enable the cloud service provider to update the data owners'\naccess policies without receiving a new re-encryption key. Besides, our scheme\nsupports fast decryption such that the decryption algorithm consists of a\nconstant number of bilinear pairing operations. The proposed scheme is proven\nto be secure in the random oracle model and under the hardness of Decisional\nBilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) and Decision Linear (D-Linear) assumptions.\nAlso, performance analysis results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is\nefficient and practical.",

    "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have recently attracted greater attention\nworldwide due to their practicality in monitoring, communicating, and reporting\nspecific physical phenomena. The data collected by WSNs is often inaccurate as\na result of unavoidable environmental factors, which may include noise, signal\nweakness, or intrusion attacks depending on the specific situation. Sending\nhigh-noise data has negative effects not just on data accuracy and network\nreliability, but also regarding the decision-making processes in the base\nstation. Anomaly detection, or outlier detection, is the process of detecting\nnoisy data amidst the contexts thus described. The literature contains\nrelatively few noise detection techniques in the context of WSNs, particularly\nfor outlier-detection algorithms applying time series analysis, which considers\nthe effective neighbors to ensure a global-collaborative detection. Hence, the\nresearch presented in this paper is intended to design and implement a global\noutlier-detection approach, which allows us to find and select appropriate\nneighbors to ensure an adaptive collaborative detection based on time-series\nanalysis and entropy techniques. The proposed approach applies a random forest\nalgorithm for identifying the best results. To measure the effectiveness and\nefficiency of the proposed approach, a comprehensive and real scenario provided\nby the Intel Berkeley Research lab has been simulated. Noisy data have been\ninjected into the collected data randomly. The results obtained from the\nexperiment then conducted experimentation demonstrate that our approach can\ndetect anomalies with up to 99% accuracy.",

In recent years, traffic control methods based on\ndeep reinforcement learning (DRL) have gained attention due to their ability to\nexploit real-time traffic data, which is often poorly used by the traditional\nhand-crafted methods. While most recent DRL-based methods have focused on\nmaximizing the throughput or minimizing the average travel time of the\nvehicles, the fairness of the traffic signal controllers has often been\nneglected. This is particularly important as neglecting fairness can lead to\nsituations where some vehicles experience extreme waiting times, or where the\nthroughput of a particular traffic flow is highly impacted by the fluctuations\nof another conflicting flow at the intersection. In order to address these\nissues, we introduce two notions of fairness: delay-based and throughput-based\nfairness, which correspond to the two issues mentioned above. Furthermore, we\npropose two DRL-based traffic signal control methods for implementing these\nfairness notions, that can achieve a high throughput as well.

While the effort for inserting a Trojan into an application-specific\nintegrated circuit (ASIC) can be considered relatively high, especially when\ntrusting the chip manufacturer, programmable hardware is vulnerable to Trojan\ninsertion even after the product has been shipped or during usage. At the same\ntime, detecting dormant HTs with small or zero-overhead triggers and payloads\non these platforms is still a challenging task, as the Trojan might not get\nactivated during the chip verification using logical testing or physical\nmeasurements. In this work, we present a novel Trojan detection approach based\non a technique known from integrated circuit (IC) failure analysis, capable of\ndetecting virtually all classes of dormant Trojans.

To support our\nclaims, we present two case studies on 28 SRAM- and flash-based\nfield-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).

    "title": "Eigensolution analysis of immersed boundary method based on volume  penalization: applications to high-order schemes",
    "abstract": "This paper presents eigensolution and non-modal analyses for immersed\nboundary methods (IBMs) based on volume penalization for the linear advection\nequation. This approach is used to analyze the behavior of flux reconstruction\n(FR) discretization, including the influence of polynomial order and\npenalization parameter on numerical errors and stability. Through a\nsemi-discrete analysis, we find that the inclusion of IBM adds additional\ndissipation without changing significantly the dispersion of the original\nnumerical discretization. This agrees with the physical intuition that in this\ntype of approach, the solid wall is modelled as a porous medium with vanishing\nviscosity. From a stability point view, the selection of penalty parameter can\nbe analyzed based on a fully-discrete analysis, which leads to practical\nguidelines on the selection of penalization parameter. Numerical experiments\nindicate that the penalization term needs to be increased to damp oscillations\ninside the solid (i.e. porous region), which leads to undesirable time step\nrestrictions. As an alternative, we propose to include a second-order term in\nthe solid for the no-slip wall boundary condition. Results show that by adding\na second-order term we improve the overall accuracy with relaxed time step\nrestriction. This indicates that the optimal value of the penalization\nparameter and the second-order damping can be carefully chosen to obtain a more\naccurate scheme. Finally, the approximated relationship between these two\nparameters is obtained and used as a guideline to select the optimum penalty\nterms in a Navier-Stokes solver, to simulate flow past a cylinder.",

    "abstract": "In a real-world scenario, human actions are typically out of the distribution\nfrom training data, which requires a model to both recognize the known actions\nand reject the unknown. Different from image data, video actions are more\nchallenging to be recognized in an open-set setting due to the uncertain\ntemporal dynamics and static bias of human actions. In this paper, we propose a\nDeep Evidential Action Recognition (DEAR) method to recognize actions in an\nopen testing set. Specifically, we formulate the action recognition problem\nfrom the evidential deep learning (EDL) perspective and propose a novel model\ncalibration method to regularize the EDL training. Besides, to mitigate the\nstatic bias of video representation, we propose a plug-and-play module to\ndebias the learned representation through contrastive learning. Experimental\nresults show that our DEAR method achieves consistent performance gain on\nmultiple mainstream action recognition models and benchmarks. Codes and\npre-trained weights will be made available upon paper acceptance.",

    "abstract": "The JavaScript language did not specify, until ECMAScript 6 (ES6), native\nfeatures for streamlining encapsulation and modularity. Developer community\nfilled the gap with a proliferation of design patterns and module formats, with\nimpact on code reusability, portability and complexity of build configurations.\nThis work studies the automated refactoring of legacy ES5 code to ES6 modules\nwith fine-grained reuse of module contents through the named import/export\nlanguage constructs. The focus is on reducing the coupling of refactored\nmodules through destructuring exported module objects to fine-grained module\nfeatures and enhancing module dependencies by leveraging the ES6 syntax. We\nemploy static analysis to construct a model of a JavaScript project, the Module\nDependence Graph (MDG), that represents modules and their dependencies. On the\nbasis of MDG we specify the refactoring procedure for module migration to ES6.\nA prototype implementation has been empirically evaluated on 19 open source\nprojects. Results highlight the relevance of the refactoring with a developer\nintent for fine-grained reuse. The analysis of refactored code shows an\nincrease in the number of reusable elements per project and reduction in the\ncoupling of refactored modules. The soundness of the refactoring is empirically\nvalidated through code inspection and execution of projects' test suites.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines a family of designs for magnetic cubes and counts how\nmany configurations are possible for each design as a function of the number of\nmodules.\nMagnetic modular cubes are cubes with magnets arranged on their faces. The\nmagnets are positioned so that each face has either magnetic south or north\npole outward. Moreover, we require that the net magnetic moment of the cube\npasses through the center of opposing faces. These magnetic arrangements enable\ncoupling when cube faces with opposite polarity are brought in close proximity\nand enable moving the cubes by controlling the orientation of a global magnetic\nfield. This paper investigates the 2D and 3D shapes that can be constructed by\nmagnetic modular cubes, and describes all possible magnet arrangements that\nobey these rules. We select ten magnetic arrangements and assign a \"colo\"' to\neach of them for ease of visualization and reference. We provide a method to\nenumerate the number of unique polyominoes and polycubes that can be\nconstructed from a given set of colored cubes. We use this method to enumerate\nall arrangements for up to 20 modules in 2D and 16 modules in 3D.

    "title": "Towards Using Package Centrality Trend to Identify Packages in Decline",
    "abstract": "Due to its increasing complexity, today's software systems are frequently\nbuilt by leveraging reusable code in the form of libraries and packages.\nSoftware ecosystems (e.g., npm) are the primary enablers of this code reuse,\nproviding developers with a platform to share their own and use others' code.\nThese ecosystems evolve rapidly: developers add new packages every day to solve\nnew problems or provide alternative solutions, causing obsolete packages to\ndecline in their importance to the community. Developers should avoid depending\non packages in decline, as these packages are reused less over time and may\nbecome less frequently maintained. However, current popularity metrics (e.g.,\nStars, and Downloads) are not fit to provide this information to developers\nbecause their semantics do not aptly capture shifts in the community interest.\nIn this paper, we propose a scalable approach that uses the package's\ncentrality in the ecosystem to identify packages in decline. We evaluate our\napproach with the npm ecosystem and show that the trends of centrality over\ntime can correctly distinguish packages in decline with a ROC-AUC of 0.9. The\napproach can capture 87% of the packages in decline, on average 18 months\nbefore the trend is shown in currently used package popularity metrics. We\nimplement this approach in a tool that can be used to augment npms metrics and\nhelp developers avoid packages in decline when reusing packages from npm.",

    "abstract": "We introduce leave-one-out unfairness, which characterizes how likely a\nmodel's prediction for an individual will change due to the inclusion or\nremoval of a single other person in the model's training data. Leave-one-out\nunfairness appeals to the idea that fair decisions are not arbitrary: they\nshould not be based on the chance event of any one person's inclusion in the\ntraining data. Leave-one-out unfairness is closely related to algorithmic\nstability, but it focuses on the consistency of an individual point's\nprediction outcome over unit changes to the training data, rather than the\nerror of the model in aggregate. Beyond formalizing leave-one-out unfairness,\nwe characterize the extent to which deep models behave leave-one-out unfairly\non real data, including in cases where the generalization error is small.\nFurther, we demonstrate that adversarial training and randomized smoothing\ntechniques have opposite effects on leave-one-out fairness, which sheds light\non the relationships between robustness, memorization, individual fairness, and\nleave-one-out fairness in deep models. Finally, we discuss salient practical\napplications that may be negatively affected by leave-one-out unfairness.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, researchers have been paying increasing attention to the\nthreats brought by deep learning models to data security and privacy,\nespecially in the field of domain adaptation. Existing unsupervised domain\nadaptation (UDA) methods can achieve promising performance without transferring\ndata from source domain to target domain. However, UDA with representation\nalignment or self-supervised pseudo-labeling relies on the transferred source\nmodels. In many data-critical scenarios, methods based on model transferring\nmay suffer from membership inference attacks and expose private data. In this\npaper, we aim to overcome a challenging new setting where the source models are\nonly queryable but cannot be transferred to the target domain. We propose\nBlack-box Probe Domain Adaptation (BPDA), which adopts query mechanism to probe\nand refine information from source model using third-party dataset. In order to\ngain more informative query results, we further propose Distributionally\nAdversarial Training (DAT) to align the distribution of third-party data with\nthat of target data. BPDA uses public third-party dataset and adversarial\nexamples based on DAT as the information carrier between source and target\ndomains, dispensing with transferring source data or model. Experimental\nresults on benchmarks of Digit-Five, Office-Caltech, Office-31, Office-Home,\nand DomainNet demonstrate the feasibility of BPDA without model transferring.",

    "abstract": "There has been an increasing interest in developing efficient immersed\nboundary method (IBM) based on Cartesian grids, recently in the context of\nhigh-order methods. IBM based on volume penalization is a robust and easy to\nimplement method to avoid body-fitted meshes and has been recently adapted to\nhigh order discretisations (Kou et al., 2021). This work proposes an\nimprovement over the classic penalty formulation for flux reconstruction high\norder solvers. We include a selective frequency damping (SFD) approach\n(Aakervik et al., 2006) acting only inside solid body defined through the\nimmersed boundary masking, to damp spurious oscillations. An encapsulated\nformulation for the SFD method is implemented, which can be used as a wrapper\naround an existing time-stepping code. The numerical properties have been\nstudied through eigensolution analysis based on the advection equation. These\nstudies not only show the advantages of using the SFD method as an alternative\nof the traditional volume penalization, but also show the favorable properties\nof combining both approaches. This new approach is then applied to the\nNavier-Stokes equation to simulate steady flow past an airfoil and unsteady\nflow past a circular cylinder. The advantages of the SFD method in providing\nimproved accuracy are reported.",

    "abstract": "Background: The evolution of symptoms over time is at the heart of\nunderstanding and treating mental disorders. However, a principled,\nquantitative framework explaining symptom dynamics remains elusive. Here, we\npropose a Network Control Theory of Psychopathology allowing us to formally\nderive a theoretical control energy which we hypothesize quantifies resistance\nto future symptom improvement in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). We test this\nhypothesis and investigate the relation to genetic and environmental risk as\nwell as resilience.\nMethods: We modelled longitudinal symptom-network dynamics derived from\nN=2,059 Beck Depression Inventory measurements acquired over a median of 134\ndays in a sample of N=109 patients suffering from MDD. We quantified the\ntheoretical energy required for each patient and time-point to reach a\nsymptom-free state given individual symptom-network topology (E 0 ) and 1)\ntested if E 0 predicts future symptom improvement and 2) whether this\nrelationship is moderated by Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) of mental disorders,\nchildhood maltreatment experience, and self-reported resilience.\nOutcomes: We show that E 0 indeed predicts symptom reduction at the next\nmeasurement and reveal that this coupling between E 0 and future symptom change\nincreases with higher genetic risk and childhood maltreatment while it\ndecreases with resilience.\nInterpretation: Our study provides a mechanistic framework capable of\npredicting future symptom improvement based on individual symptom-network\ntopology and clarifies the role of genetic and environmental risk as well as\nresilience.

Focusing on 2K posts from\ntwo image boards, 4chan and 8chan, and 1.2 M comments and posts from 12\nsubreddits dedicated to QAnon, we adopt a mixed methods approach to uncover the\nsymbolic language representing the movement, expectations, practices, heroes\nand foes of the QAnon community. We use these social imaginaries to create a\ncomputational framework for distinguishing belief and dissonance from general\ndiscussion about QAnon. Further, analyzing user engagement with QAnon\nconspiracy subreddits, we find that self-disclosures of dissonance correlate\nwith a significant decrease in user contributions and ultimately with their\ndeparture from the community. We contribute a computational framework for\nidentifying dissonance self-disclosures and measuring the changes in user\nengagement surrounding dissonance. Our work can provide insights into designing\ndissonance-based interventions that can potentially dissuade conspiracists from\nonline conspiracy discussion communities.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a simple MLP-like architecture, CycleMLP, which is a\nversatile backbone for visual recognition and dense predictions, unlike modern\nMLP architectures, e.g., MLP-Mixer, ResMLP, and gMLP, whose architectures are\ncorrelated to image size and thus are infeasible in object detection and\nsegmentation. CycleMLP has two advantages compared to modern approaches. (1) It\ncan cope with various image sizes. (2) It achieves linear computational\ncomplexity to image size by using local windows. In contrast, previous MLPs\nhave quadratic computations because of their fully spatial connections. We\nbuild a family of models that surpass existing MLPs and achieve a comparable\naccuracy (83.2%) on ImageNet-1K classification compared to the state-of-the-art\nTransformer such as Swin Transformer (83.3%) but using fewer parameters and\nFLOPs. We expand the MLP-like models' applicability, making them a versatile\nbackbone for dense prediction tasks. CycleMLP aims to provide a competitive\nbaseline on object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation\nfor MLP models. In particular, CycleMLP achieves 45.1 mIoU on ADE20K val,\ncomparable to Swin (45.2 mIOU). Code is available at\n\\url{https://github.com/ShoufaChen/CycleMLP}.",

    "abstract": "During the past decade, deep learning's performance has been widely\nrecognized in a variety of machine learning tasks, ranging from image\nclassification, speech recognition to natural language understanding. Graph\nneural networks (GNN) are a type of deep learning that is designed to handle\nnon-Euclidean issues using graph-structured data that are difficult to solve\nwith traditional deep learning techniques. The majority of GNNs were created\nusing a variety of processes, including random walk, PageRank, graph\nconvolution, and heat diffusion, making direct comparisons impossible. Previous\nstudies have primarily focused on classifying current models into distinct\ncategories, with little investigation of their internal relationships. This\nresearch proposes a unified theoretical framework and a novel perspective that\ncan methodologically integrate existing GNN into our framework. We survey and\ncategorize existing GNN models into spatial and spectral domains, as well as\nshow linkages between subcategories within each domain.

Machine learning (ML) methods\nare being used in RWE and are promising tools for precision-medicine. In this\nstudy, ML methods are applied to study the efficacy of therapies on COVID-19\nhospital admissions in the Valencian Region in Spain. Methods: 5244 and 1312\nCOVID-19 hospital admissions - dated between January 2020 and January 2021 from\n10 health departments, were used respectively for training and validation of\nseparate treatment-effect models (TE-ML) for remdesivir, corticosteroids,\ntocilizumab, lopinavir-ritonavir, azithromycin and\nchloroquine/hydroxychloroquine. 2390 admissions from 2 additional health\ndepartments were reserved as an independent test to analyze retrospectively the\nsurvival benefits of therapies in the population selected by the TE-ML models\nusing cox-proportional hazard models. TE-ML models were adjusted using\ntreatment propensity scores to control for pre-treatment confounding variables\nassociated to outcome and further evaluated for futility. ML architecture was\nbased on boosted decision-trees. Results: In the populations identified by the\nTE-ML models, only Remdesivir and Tocilizumab were significantly associated\nwith an increase in survival time, with hazard ratios of 0.41 (P = 0.04) and\n0.21 (P = 0.001), respectively. No survival benefits from chloroquine\nderivatives, lopinavir-ritonavir and azithromycin were demonstrated. Tools to\nexplain the predictions of TE-ML models are explored at patient-level as\npotential tools for personalized decision making and precision medicine.\nConclusion: ML methods are suitable tools toward RWE analysis of COVID-19\npharmacotherapies.

Many research\nworks focus on future smart cities with a holistic approach towards smart city\ndevelopment. In this paper, we introduce such future smart cities that leverage\nblockchain technology in areas like data security, energy and waste management,\ngovernance, transport, supply chain, including emergency events, and\nenvironmental monitoring. Blockchain, being a decentralized immutable ledger,\nhas the potential to promote the development of smart cities by guaranteeing\ntransparency, data security, interoperability, and privacy. Particularly, using\nblockchain in emergency events will provide interoperability between many\nparties involved in the response, will increase timeliness of services, and\nestablish transparency. In that case, if a current fee-based or\nfirst-come-first-serve-based processing is used, emergency events may get\ndelayed in being processed due to competition, and thus, threatening people's\nlives. Thus, there is a need for transaction prioritization based on the\npriority of information and quick creation of blocks (variable interval block\ncreation mechanism). Also, since the leaders ensure transaction prioritization\nwhile generating blocks, leader rotation and proper election procedure become\nimportant for the transaction prioritization process to take place honestly and\nefficiently. In our consensus protocol, we deploy a machine learning (ML)\nalgorithm to achieve efficient leader election and design a novel dynamic block\ncreation algorithm. Also, to ensure honest assessment from the followers on the\nblocks generated by the leaders, a peer-prediction-based verification mechanism\nis proposed.

We then propose Skill-based Learning with Demonstrations\n(SkiLD), an algorithm for demonstration-guided RL that efficiently leverages\nthe provided demonstrations by following the demonstrated skills instead of the\nprimitive actions, resulting in substantial performance improvements over prior\ndemonstration-guided RL approaches.

    "abstract": "One-shot voice conversion (VC), which performs conversion across arbitrary\nspeakers with only a single target-speaker utterance for reference, can be\neffectively achieved by speech representation disentanglement. Existing work\ngenerally ignores the correlation between different speech representations\nduring training, which causes leakage of content information into the speaker\nrepresentation and thus degrades VC performance. To alleviate this issue, we\nemploy vector quantization (VQ) for content encoding and introduce mutual\ninformation (MI) as the correlation metric during training, to achieve proper\ndisentanglement of content, speaker and pitch representations, by reducing\ntheir inter-dependencies in an unsupervised manner. Experimental results\nreflect the superiority of the proposed method in learning effective\ndisentangled speech representations for retaining source linguistic content and\nintonation variations, while capturing target speaker characteristics. In doing\nso, the proposed approach achieves higher speech naturalness and speaker\nsimilarity than current state-of-the-art one-shot VC systems.

However, current GAN technologies for 3D medical image\nsynthesis need to be significantly improved to be readily adapted to real-world\nmedical problems. In this paper, we extend the state-of-the-art StyleGAN2\nmodel, which natively works with two-dimensional images, to enable 3D image\nsynthesis. In addition to the image synthesis, we investigate the\ncontrollability and interpretability of the 3D-StyleGAN via style vectors\ninherited form the original StyleGAN2 that are highly suitable for medical\napplications: (i) the latent space projection and reconstruction of unseen real\nimages, and (ii) style mixing. We demonstrate the 3D-StyleGAN's performance and\nfeasibility with ~12,000 three-dimensional full brain MR T1 images, although it\ncan be applied to any 3D volumetric images. Furthermore, we explore different\nconfigurations of hyperparameters to investigate potential improvement of the\nimage synthesis with larger networks.

Our\nfirst objective is to identify the embedding of a set of high-dimensional data\nrepresenting quantities of interest of the computational or analytical model.\nFor this purpose, we employ Grassmannian diffusion maps, a two-step nonlinear\ndimension reduction technique which allows us to reduce the dimensionality of\nthe data and identify meaningful geometric descriptions in a parsimonious and\ninexpensive manner. Polynomial chaos expansion is then used to construct a\nmapping between the stochastic input parameters and the diffusion coordinates\nof the reduced space. An adaptive clustering technique is proposed to identify\nan optimal number of clusters of points in the latent space. The similarity of\npoints allows us to construct a number of geometric harmonic emulators which\nare finally utilized as a set of inexpensive pre-trained models to perform an\ninverse map of realizations of latent features to the ambient space and thus\nperform accurate out-of-sample predictions. Thus, the proposed method acts as\nan encoder-decoder system which is able to automatically handle very\nhigh-dimensional data while simultaneously operating successfully in the\nsmall-data regime.

A\nscale mixture model is a stochastic EMG model in which the EMG variance is\nconsidered as a random variable, enabling the representation of uncertainty in\nthe variance. This model is extended in this study and utilized for EMG pattern\nclassification.

Our results fully\ncover the cases where such an upper bound provided by the univariate Descartes'\nrule of signs is one.

A particular deep kernel process, the deep Wishart process\n(DWP), is of particular interest because its prior is equivalent to deep\nGaussian process (DGP) priors. However, inference in DWPs has not yet been\npossible due to the lack of sufficiently flexible distributions over positive\nsemi-definite matrices.

    "abstract": "Remixing separated audio sources trades off interferer attenuation against\nthe amount of audible deteriorations. This paper proposes a non-intrusive audio\nquality estimation method for controlling this trade-off in a signal-adaptive\nmanner. The recently proposed 2f-model is adopted as the underlying quality\nmeasure, since it has been shown to correlate strongly with basic audio quality\nin source separation. An alternative operation mode of the measure is proposed,\nmore appropriate when considering material with long inactive periods of the\ntarget source. The 2f-model requires the reference target source as an input,\nbut this is not available in many applications. Deep neural networks (DNNs) are\ntrained to estimate the 2f-model intrusively using the reference target\n(iDNN2f), non-intrusively using the input mix as reference (nDNN2f), and\nreference-free using only the separated output signal (rDNN2f). It is shown\nthat iDNN2f achieves very strong correlation with the original measure on the\ntest data (Pearson r=0.99), while performance decreases for nDNN2f (r>=0.91)\nand rDNN2f (r>=0.82). The non-intrusive estimate nDNN2f is mapped to select\nitem-dependent remixing gains with the aim of maximizing the interferer\nattenuation under a constraint on the minimum quality of the remixed output\n(e.g., audible but not annoying deteriorations). A listening test shows that\nthis is successfully achieved even with very different selected gains (up to 23\ndB difference).",

Building on connectome-based graph analysis\nand control theory, Network Control Theory is emerging as a powerful tool to\nquantify network controllability - i.e., the influence of one brain region over\nothers regarding dynamic network state transitions. If and how network\ncontrollability is related to mental health remains elusive.\nMethods: From Diffusion Tensor Imaging data, we inferred structural\nconnectivity and inferred calculated network controllability parameters to\ninvestigate their association with genetic and familial risk in patients\ndiagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD, n=692) and healthy controls\n(n=820).\nResults: First, we establish that controllability measures differ between\nhealthy controls and MDD patients while not varying with current symptom\nseverity or remission status. Second, we show that controllability in MDD\npatients is associated with polygenic scores for MDD and psychiatric\ncross-disorder risk. Finally, we provide evidence that controllability varies\nwith familial risk of MDD and bipolar disorder as well as with body mass index.\nConclusions: We show that network controllability is related to genetic,\nindividual, and familial risk in MDD patients.

However, this promise hast not yet been realized due to noisy\nqubits and lack of robust error correction schemes. Here we explore a\npromising, alternative method for prime factorization that uses\nwell-established techniques from variational imaginary time evolution. We\ncreate a Hamiltonian whose ground state encodes the solution to the problem and\nuse variational techniques to evolve a state iteratively towards these prime\nfactors. We show that the number of circuits evaluated in each iteration scales\nas O(n^{5}d), where n is the bit-length of the number to be factorized and $d$\nis the depth of the circuit. We use a single layer of entangling gates to\nfactorize several numbers represented using 7, 8, and 9-qubit Hamiltonians. We\nalso verify the method's performance by implementing it on the IBMQ Lima\nhardware.",

    "title": "Learning a Large Neighborhood Search Algorithm for Mixed Integer  Programs",
    "abstract": "Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) is a combinatorial optimization heuristic\nthat starts with an assignment of values for the variables to be optimized, and\niteratively improves it by searching a large neighborhood around the current\nassignment. In this paper we consider a learning-based LNS approach for mixed\ninteger programs (MIPs). We train a Neural Diving model to represent a\nprobability distribution over assignments, which, together with an existing MIP\nsolver, generates an initial assignment. Formulating the subsequent search\nsteps as a Markov Decision Process, we train a Neural Neighborhood Selection\npolicy to select a search neighborhood at each step, which is searched using a\nMIP solver to find the next assignment. The policy network is trained using\nimitation learning. We propose a target policy for imitation that, given enough\ncompute resources, is guaranteed to select the neighborhood containing the\noptimal next assignment across all possible choices for the neighborhood of a\nspecified size. Our approach matches or outperforms all the baselines on five\nreal-world MIP datasets with large-scale instances from diverse applications,\nincluding two production applications at Google. At large running times it\nachieves $2\\times$ to $37.8\\times$ better average primal gap than the best\nbaseline on three of the datasets.",

    "title": "Differentiable Annealed Importance Sampling and the Perils of Gradient  Noise",
    "abstract": "Annealed importance sampling (AIS) and related algorithms are highly\neffective tools for marginal likelihood estimation, but are not fully\ndifferentiable due to the use of Metropolis-Hastings (MH) correction steps.\nDifferentiability is a desirable property as it would admit the possibility of\noptimizing marginal likelihood as an objective using gradient-based methods. To\nthis end, we propose a differentiable AIS algorithm by abandoning MH steps,\nwhich further unlocks mini-batch computation. We provide a detailed convergence\nanalysis for Bayesian linear regression which goes beyond previous analyses by\nexplicitly accounting for non-perfect transitions. Using this analysis, we\nprove that our algorithm is consistent in the full-batch setting and provide a\nsublinear convergence rate. However, we show that the algorithm is inconsistent\nwhen mini-batch gradients are used due to a fundamental incompatibility between\nthe goals of last-iterate convergence to the posterior and elimination of the\npathwise stochastic error. This result is in stark contrast to our experience\nwith stochastic optimization and stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics, where\nthe effects of gradient noise can be washed out by taking more steps of a\nsmaller size. Our negative result relies crucially on our explicit\nconsideration of convergence to the stationary distribution, and it helps\nexplain the difficulty of developing practically effective AIS-like algorithms\nthat exploit mini-batch gradients.",

    "title": "Counting tensor rank decompositions",
    "abstract": "The tensor rank decomposition is a useful tool for the geometric\ninterpretation of the tensors in the canonical tensor model (CTM) of quantum\ngravity. In order to understand the stability of this interpretation, it is\nimportant to be able to estimate how many tensor rank decompositions can\napproximate a given tensor. More precisely, finding an approximate symmetric\ntensor rank decomposition of a symmetric tensor $Q$ with an error allowance\n$\\Delta$ is to find vectors $\\phi^i$ satisfying $\\|Q-\\sum_{i=1}^R \\phi^i\\otimes\n\\phi^i\\cdots \\otimes \\phi^i\\|^2 \\leq \\Delta$. The volume of all possible such\n$\\phi^i$ is an interesting quantity which measures the amount of possible\ndecompositions for a tensor $Q$ within an allowance. While it would be\ndifficult to evaluate this quantity for each $Q$, we find an explicit formula\nfor a similar quantity by integrating over all $Q$ of unit norm. The expression\nas a function of $\\Delta$ is given by the product of a hypergeometric function\nand a power function. We also extend the formula to generic decompositions of\nnon-symmetric tensors. The derivation depends on the existence (convergence) of\nthe partition function of a matrix model which appeared in the context of the\nCTM.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of sampling from the ferromagnetic Potts and\nrandom-cluster models on a general family of random graphs via the Glauber\ndynamics for the random-cluster model. The random-cluster model is parametrized\nby an edge probability $p \\in (0,1)$ and a cluster weight $q > 0$. We establish\nthat for every $q\\ge 1$, the random-cluster Glauber dynamics mixes in optimal\n$\\Theta(n\\log n)$ steps on $n$-vertex random graphs having a prescribed degree\nsequence with bounded average branching $\\gamma$, throughout the uniqueness\nregime $p<p_u(q,\\gamma)$. Notably, this uniqueness threshold does not decay\nwith the maximum degree and only depends on the average degree. In particular,\n$p_u(q,\\gamma)$ is expected to be sharp, in that for general $q$ and $\\gamma$,\nthe random-cluster Glauber dynamics should slow down dramatically at\n$p_u(q,\\gamma)$.\nThe family of random graph models we consider include the Erd\\H{o}s--R\\'enyi\nrandom graph $G(n,\\gamma/n)$, and so we provide the first polynomial-time\nsampling algorithm for the ferromagnetic Potts model on the Erd\\H{o}s--R\\'enyi\nrandom graphs that works for all $q$ in the full uniqueness regime. We\naccompany our results with mixing time lower bounds (exponential in the maximum\ndegree) for the Potts Glauber dynamics, in the same settings where our\n$\\Theta(n \\log n)$ bounds for the random-cluster Glauber dynamics apply. This\nreveals a significant computational advantage of random-cluster based\nalgorithms for sampling from the Potts Gibbs distribution at high temperatures\nin the presence of high-degree vertices.",
