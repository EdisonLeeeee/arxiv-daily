    "title": "Support Recovery in Universal One-bit Compressed Sensing",
    "abstract": "One-bit compressed sensing (1bCS) is an extreme-quantized signal acquisition\nmethod that has been widely studied in the past decade. In 1bCS, linear samples\nof a high dimensional signal are quantized to only one bit per sample (sign of\nthe measurement). Assuming the original signal vector to be sparse, existing\nresults either aim to find the support of the vector, or approximate the signal\nwithin an $\\epsilon$-ball. The focus of this paper is support recovery, which\noften also computationally facilitates approximate signal recovery. A universal\nmeasurement matrix for 1bCS refers to one set of measurements that work for all\nsparse signals. With universality, it is known that $\\tilde{\\Theta}(k^2)$ 1bCS\nmeasurements are necessary and sufficient for support recovery (where $k$\ndenotes the sparsity). In this work, we show that it is possible to universally\nrecover the support with a small number of false positives with\n$\\tilde{O}(k^{3/2})$ measurements. If the dynamic range of the signal vector is\nknown, then with a different technique, this result can be improved to only\n$\\tilde{O}(k)$ measurements. Further results on support recovery are also\nprovided.",

    "title": "Learning a Sensor-invariant Embedding of Satellite Data: A Case Study  for Lake Ice Monitoring",
    "abstract": "Fusing satellite imagery acquired with different sensors has been a\nlong-standing challenge of Earth observation, particularly across different\nmodalities such as optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. Here, we\nexplore the joint analysis of imagery from different sensors in the light of\nrepresentation learning: we propose to learn a joint, sensor-invariant\nembedding (feature representation) within a deep neural network. Our\napplication problem is the monitoring of lake ice on Alpine lakes. To reach the\ntemporal resolution requirement of the Swiss Global Climate Observing System\n(GCOS) office, we combine three image sources: Sentinel-1 SAR (S1-SAR), Terra\nMODIS and Suomi-NPP VIIRS. The large gaps between the optical and SAR domains\nand between the sensor resolutions make this a challenging instance of the\nsensor fusion problem. Our approach can be classified as a feature-level fusion\nthat is learnt in a data-driven manner. The proposed network architecture has\nseparate encoding branches for each image sensor, which feed into a single\nlatent embedding. I.e., a common feature representation shared by all inputs,\nsuch that subsequent processing steps deliver comparable output irrespective of\nwhich sort of input image was used. By fusing satellite data, we map lake ice\nat a temporal resolution of <1.5 days. The network produces spatially explicit\nlake ice maps with pixel-wise accuracies >91.3% (respectively, mIoU scores\n>60.7%) and generalises well across different lakes and winters. Moreover, it\nsets a new state-of-the-art for determining the important ice-on and ice-off\ndates for the target lakes, in many cases meeting the GCOS requirement.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning and especially the use of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) provides\nimpressive results in various regression and classification tasks. However, to\nachieve these results, there is a high demand for computing and storing\nresources. This becomes problematic when, for instance, real-time, mobile\napplications are considered, in which the involved (embedded) devices have\nlimited resources. A common way of addressing this problem is to transform the\noriginal large pre-trained networks into new smaller models, by utilizing Model\nCompression and Acceleration (MCA) techniques. Within the MCA framework, we\npropose a clustering-based approach that is able to increase the number of\nemployed centroids/representatives, while at the same time, have an\nacceleration gain compared to conventional, $k$-means based approaches. This is\nachieved by imposing a special structure to the employed representatives, which\nis enabled by the particularities of the problem at hand. Moreover, the\ntheoretical acceleration gains are presented and the key system\nhyper-parameters that affect that gain, are identified.

In this context, Face Recognition (FR) systems have the potential\nto match faces to specific names and identities, creating glaring privacy\nconcerns. Adversarial attacks are a promising way to grant users privacy from\nFR systems by disrupting their capability to recognize faces. Yet, such attacks\ncan be perceptible to human observers, especially under the more challenging\nblack-box threat model. In the literature, the justification for the\nimperceptibility of such attacks hinges on bounding metrics such as $\\ell_p$\nnorms. However, there is not much research on how these norms match up with\nhuman perception. Through examining and measuring both the effectiveness of\nrecent black-box attacks in the face recognition setting and their\ncorresponding human perceptibility through survey data, we demonstrate the\ntrade-offs in perceptibility that occur as attacks become more aggressive.

We find empirically that long after\nperformance has converged, networks continue to move through parameter space by\na process of anomalous diffusion in which distance travelled grows as a power\nlaw in the number of gradient updates with a nontrivial exponent. We reveal an\nintricate interaction between the hyperparameters of optimization, the\nstructure in the gradient noise, and the Hessian matrix at the end of training\nthat explains this anomalous diffusion. To build this understanding, we first\nderive a continuous-time model for SGD with finite learning rates and batch\nsizes as an underdamped Langevin equation. We study this equation in the\nsetting of linear regression, where we can derive exact, analytic expressions\nfor the phase space dynamics of the parameters and their instantaneous\nvelocities from initialization to stationarity. Using the Fokker-Planck\nequation, we show that the key ingredient driving these dynamics is not the\noriginal training loss, but rather the combination of a modified loss, which\nimplicitly regularizes the velocity, and probability currents, which cause\noscillations in phase space.

In\nthe same spirit, learning can be guided, ensuring safety via augmenting episode\nbatches with states where the desired action probabilities are prescribed.\nFinally, exogenous discounted sum of future rewards (returns) can be computed\nat these specific state-action pairs such that the policy network satisfies\nconstraints. Computing the returns is based on solving a system of linear\nequations (equality constraints) or a constrained quadratic program (inequality\nconstraints). Simulation results suggest that adding constraints (external\ninformation) to the learning can improve learning in terms of speed and safety\nreasonably if constraints are appropriately selected. The efficiency of the\nconstrained learning was demonstrated with a shallow and wide ReLU network in\nthe Cartpole and Lunar Lander OpenAI gym environments. The main novelty of the\npaper is giving a practical use of the neural tangent kernel in reinforcement\nlearning.",

    "abstract": "With the recent success of representation learning methods, which includes\ndeep learning as a special case, there has been considerable interest in\ndeveloping representation learning techniques that can incorporate known\nphysical constraints into the learned representation. As one example, in many\napplications that involve a signal propagating through physical media (e.g.,\noptics, acoustics, fluid dynamics, etc), it is known that the dynamics of the\nsignal must satisfy constraints imposed by the wave equation. Here we propose a\nmatrix factorization technique that decomposes such signals into a sum of\ncomponents, where each component is regularized to ensure that it satisfies\nwave equation constraints. Although our proposed formulation is non-convex, we\nprove that our model can be efficiently solved to global optimality in\npolynomial time.

This gap is problematic because diversity is not a monolithic\nconcept.

In this\nwork, we draw on research in philosophy, psychology, and social and\norganizational sciences to make three contributions: First, we introduce a\ntaxonomy of different diversity concepts from philosophy of science, and\nexplicate the distinct epistemic and political rationales underlying these\nconcepts.

In these scenarios, the underlying graph\noften changes with time due to link failures or topology variations, creating a\nmismatch between the graphs on which GNNs were trained and the ones on which\nthey are tested. Online learning can be leveraged to retrain GNNs at testing\ntime to overcome this issue. However, most online algorithms are centralized\nand usually offer guarantees only on convex problems, which GNNs rarely lead\nto. This paper develops the Wide and Deep GNN (WD-GNN), a novel architecture\nthat can be updated with distributed online learning mechanisms. The WD-GNN\nconsists of two components: the wide part is a linear graph filter and the deep\npart is a nonlinear GNN. At training time, the joint wide and deep architecture\nlearns nonlinear representations from data. At testing time, the wide, linear\npart is retrained, while the deep, nonlinear one remains fixed. This often\nleads to a convex formulation. We further propose a distributed online learning\nalgorithm that can be implemented in a decentralized setting. We also show the\nstability of the WD-GNN to changes of the underlying graph and analyze the\nconvergence of the proposed online learning procedure. Experiments on movie\nrecommendation, source localization and robot swarm control corroborate\ntheoretical findings and show the potential of the WD-GNN for distributed\nonline learning.",

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection in images plays a significant role for many applications\nacross all industries, such as disease diagnosis in healthcare or quality\nassurance in manufacturing. Manual inspection of images, when extended over a\nmonotonously repetitive period of time is very time consuming and can lead to\nanomalies being overlooked.Artificial neural networks have proven themselves\nvery successful on simple, repetitive tasks, in some cases even outperforming\nhumans. Therefore, in this paper we investigate different methods of deep\nlearning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, for anomaly detection\napplied to a quality assurance use case. We utilize the MVTec anomaly dataset\nand develop three different models, a CNN for supervised anomaly detection,\nKD-CAE for autoencoder anomaly detection, NI-CAE for noise induced anomaly\ndetection and a DCGAN for generating reconstructed images. By experiments, we\nfound that KD-CAE performs better on the anomaly datasets compared to CNN and\nNI-CAE, with NI-CAE performing the best on the Transistor dataset. We also\nimplemented a DCGAN for the creation of new training data but due to\ncomputational limitation and lack of extrapolating the mechanics of AnoGAN, we\nrestricted ourselves just to the generation of GAN based images. We conclude\nthat unsupervised methods are more powerful for anomaly detection in images,\nespecially in a setting where only a small amount of anomalous data is\navailable, or the data is unlabeled.",

In particular, we conclude conditional\noptimality of the state-of-the-art algorithms for finding such factors.\nOverall, we show 3SUM-hardness of (a) detecting an Abelian square factor of\nan odd half-length, (b) computing centers of all Abelian square factors, (c)\ndetecting an additive square factor in a length-$n$ string of integers of\nmagnitude $n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}$, and (d) a problem of computing a double 3-term\narithmetic progression (i.e., finding indices $i \\ne j$ such that\n$(x_i+x_j)/2=x_{(i+j)/2}$) in a sequence of integers $x_1,\\dots,x_n$ of\nmagnitude $n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}$.\nProblem (d) is essentially a convolution version of the AVERAGE problem that\nwas proposed in a manuscript of Erickson.

Near-ground sensors provide valuable\ninformation, yet, the process of collecting, assessing, and interpreting\nmeasurements requires significant human labor.

We retrofit a small wheeled mobile\nrobot with a small electromagnetic induction sensor by studying and taking into\nconsideration the effect of the robot body to the sensor's readings, and\ndevelop a software stack to enable autonomous logging of geo-referenced\nmeasurements. The proposed roboticized ECa measurement method is evaluated by\nmapping a 50m x 30m field against the baseline of human-conducted measurements\nobtained by walking the sensor in the same field and following the same path.\nExperimental testing reveals that our approach yields roboticized measurements\ncomparable to human-conducted ones, despite the robot's small form factor.",

    "abstract": "Near infrared (NIR) imaging has been widely applied in low-light imaging\nscenarios; however, it is difficult for human and algorithms to perceive the\nreal scene in the colorless NIR domain. While Generative Adversarial Network\n(GAN) has been widely employed in various image colorization tasks, it is\nchallenging for a direct mapping mechanism, such as a conventional GAN, to\ntransform an image from the NIR to the RGB domain with correct semantic\nreasoning, well-preserved textures, and vivid color combinations concurrently.\nIn this work, we propose a novel Attention-based NIR image colorization\nframework via Adaptive Fusion of Semantic and Texture clues, aiming at\nachieving these goals within the same framework. The tasks of texture transfer\nand semantic reasoning are carried out in two separate network blocks.\nSpecifically, the Texture Transfer Block (TTB) aims at extracting texture\nfeatures from the NIR image's Laplacian component and transferring them for\nsubsequent color fusion. The Semantic Reasoning Block (SRB) extracts semantic\nclues and maps the NIR pixel values to the RGB domain. Finally, a Fusion\nAttention Block (FAB) is proposed to adaptively fuse the features from the two\nbranches and generate an optimized colorization result. In order to enhance the\nnetwork's learning capacity in semantic reasoning as well as mapping precision\nin texture transfer, we have proposed the Residual Coordinate Attention Block\n(RCAB), which incorporates coordinate attention into a residual learning\nframework, enabling the network to capture long-range dependencies along the\nchannel direction and meanwhile precise positional information can be preserved\nalong spatial directions. RCAB is also incorporated into FAB to facilitate\naccurate texture alignment during fusion.

    "abstract": "We revisit the well-studied problem of budget-feasible procurement, where a\nbuyer with a strict budget constraint seeks to acquire services from a group of\nstrategic providers (the sellers). During the last decade, several\nstrategyproof budget-feasible procurement auctions have been proposed, aiming\nto maximize the value of the buyer, while eliciting each seller's true cost for\nproviding their service. These solutions predominantly take the form of\nrandomized sealed-bid auctions: they ask the sellers to report their private\ncosts and then use randomization to determine which subset of services will be\nprocured and how much each of the chosen providers will be paid, ensuring that\nthe total payment does not exceed budget. Our main result in this paper is a\nnovel method for designing budget-feasible auctions, leading to solutions that\noutperform the previously proposed auctions in multiple ways.\nFirst, our solutions take the form of descending clock auctions, and thus\nsatisfy a list of properties, such as obvious strategyproofness, group\nstrategyproofness, transparency, and unconditional winner privacy; this makes\nthese auctions much more likely to be used in practice. Second, in contrast to\nprevious results that heavily depend on randomization, our auctions are\ndeterministic. As a result, we provide an affirmative answer to one of the main\nopen questions in this literature, asking whether a deterministic strategyproof\nauction can achieve a constant approximation when the buyer's valuation\nfunction is submodular over the set of services. In addition, we also provide\nthe first deterministic budget-feasible auction that matches the approximation\nbound of the best-known randomized auction for the class of subadditive\nvaluations. Finally, using our method, we improve the best-known approximation\nfactor for monotone submodular valuations, which has been the focus of most of\nthe prior work.",

    "abstract": "The goal of few-shot classification is to classify new categories with few\nlabeled examples within each class. Nowadays, the excellent performance in\nhandling few-shot classification problems is shown by metric-based\nmeta-learning methods. However, it is very hard for previous methods to\ndiscriminate the fine-grained sub-categories in the embedding space without\nfine-grained labels. This may lead to unsatisfactory generalization to\nfine-grained subcategories, and thus affects model interpretation. To tackle\nthis problem, we introduce the contrastive loss into few-shot classification\nfor learning latent fine-grained structure in the embedding space. Furthermore,\nto overcome the drawbacks of random image transformation used in current\ncontrastive learning in producing noisy and inaccurate image pairs (i.e.,\nviews), we develop a learning-to-learn algorithm to automatically generate\ndifferent views of the same image. Extensive experiments on standard few-shot\nlearning benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method.",

    "abstract": "Collecting large-scale annotated satellite imagery datasets is essential for\ndeep-learning-based global building change surveillance. In particular, the\nscroll imaging mode of optical satellites enables larger observation ranges and\nshorter revisit periods, facilitating efficient global surveillance. However,\nthe images in recent satellite change detection datasets are mainly captured at\nnear-nadir viewing angles. In this paper, we introduce S2Looking, a building\nchange detection dataset that contains large-scale side-looking satellite\nimages captured at varying off-nadir angles. Our S2Looking dataset consists of\n5000 registered bitemporal image pairs (size of 1024*1024, 0.5 ~ 0.8 m/pixel)\nof rural areas throughout the world and more than 65,920 annotated change\ninstances. We provide two label maps to separately indicate the newly built and\ndemolished building regions for each sample in the dataset. We establish a\nbenchmark task based on this dataset, i.e., identifying the pixel-level\nbuilding changes in the bi-temporal images. We test several state-of-the-art\nmethods on both the S2Looking dataset and the (near-nadir) LEVIR-CD+ dataset.\nThe experimental results show that recent change detection methods exhibit much\npoorer performance on the S2Looking than on LEVIR-CD+. The proposed S2Looking\ndataset presents three main challenges: 1) large viewing angle changes, 2)\nlarge illumination variances and 3) various complex scene characteristics\nencountered in rural areas. Our proposed dataset may promote the development of\nalgorithms for satellite image change detection and registration under\nconditions of large off-nadir angles.

    "abstract": "Existing long-tailed recognition methods, aiming to train class-balance\nmodels from long-tailed data, generally assume the models would be evaluated on\nthe uniform test class distribution. However, the practical test class\ndistribution often violates such an assumption (e.g., being long-tailed or even\ninversely long-tailed), which would lead existing methods to fail in real-world\napplications. In this work, we study a more practical task setting, called\ntest-agnostic long-tailed recognition, where the training class distribution is\nlong-tailed while the test class distribution is unknown and can be skewed\narbitrarily. In addition to the issue of class imbalance, this task poses\nanother challenge: the class distribution shift between the training and test\nsamples is unidentified. To address this task, we propose a new method, called\nTest-time Aggregating Diverse Experts (TADE), that presents two solution\nstrategies: (1) a novel skill-diverse expert learning strategy that trains\ndiverse experts to excel at handling different test distributions from a single\nlong-tailed training distribution; (2) a novel test-time expert aggregation\nstrategy that leverages self-supervision to aggregate multiple experts for\nhandling various test distributions. Moreover, we theoretically show that our\nmethod has provable ability to simulate unknown test class distributions.\nPromising results on both vanilla and test-agnostic long-tailed recognition\nverify the effectiveness of TADE.

The LEO\nconstellation of the small satellites is designed in a way, which can cover the\nentire footprint of India. Since India lies a little above the equatorial\nregion, the orbital parameters are adjusted in a way that inclination of 36\ndegrees and RAAN varies from 70-130 degrees at a height of 600 km has been\nconsidered. A total number of 4 orbital planes are designed in which each\norbital plane consisting 3 small satellites with 120-degrees true anomaly\nseparation. Each satellite is capable of taking multiple look images with the\nminimum resolution of 1 meter per pixel and swath width of 10 km approx. The\nmultiple look images captured by the SAR payload help in continuous\ninfrastructure monitoring of our interested footprint area in India. Each small\nsatellite is equipped with a communication payload that uses X-band and VHF\nantenna, whereas the TT&C will use a high data-rate S-band transmitter. The\npaper presents only a coverage metrics analysis method of our designed\nconstellation for our India footprint by considering the important metrics like\nrevisit time, response time, and coverage efficiency.

This task is furthermore complicated on small\nsatellites by the limited space and computational power available on-board.\nThis, coupled with a usually low budget, restricts small satellites from using\nhigh precision sensors for its especially important task of attitude\nestimation. On top of this, small satellites, on account of their size and\nweight, are comparatively more sensitive to environmental or orbital\ndisturbances as compared to their larger counterparts. Magnetic disturbance\nforms the major contributor to orbital disturbances on small satellites in\nLower Earth Orbits (LEO). This magnetic disturbance depends on the Residual\nMagnetic Moment (RMM) of the satellite itself, which for higher accuracy should\nbe determined in real-time. This paper presents a method for in-orbit\nestimation of the satellite magnetic dipole using a Random Walk Model in order\nto circumnavigate the inaccuracy arising due to unknown orbital magnetic\ndisturbances. It is also ensured that the dipole as well as attitude estimation\nof the satellite is done using only a magnetometer as the sensor.",

    "abstract": "This thesis focuses on dealing with the task of acoustic scene classification\n(ASC), and then applied the techniques developed for ASC to a real-life\napplication of detecting respiratory disease. To deal with ASC challenges, this\nthesis addresses three main factors that directly affect the performance of an\nASC system. Firstly, this thesis explores input features by making use of\nmultiple spectrograms (log-mel, Gamma, and CQT) for low-level feature\nextraction to tackle the issue of insufficiently discriminative or descriptive\ninput features. Next, a novel Encoder network architecture is introduced. The\nEncoder firstly transforms each low-level spectrogram into high-level\nintermediate features, or embeddings, and thus combines these high-level\nfeatures to form a very distinct composite feature. The composite or combined\nfeature is then explored in terms of classification performance, with different\nDecoders such as Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perception (MLP), and Mixture\nof Experts (MoE). By using this Encoder-Decoder framework, it helps to reduce\nthe computation cost of the reference process in ASC systems which make use of\nmultiple spectrogram inputs. Since the proposed techniques applied for general\nASC tasks were shown to be highly effective, this inspired an application to a\nspecific real-life application. This was namely the 2017 Internal Conference on\nBiomedical Health Informatics (ICBHI) respiratory sound dataset. Building upon\nthe proposed ASC framework, the ICBHI tasks were tackled with a deep learning\nframework, and the resulting system shown to be capable at detecting\nrespiratory anomaly cycles and diseases.",

    "title": "Locality-aware Channel-wise Dropout for Occluded Face Recognition",
    "abstract": "Face recognition remains a challenging task in unconstrained scenarios,\nespecially when faces are partially occluded. To improve the robustness against\nocclusion, augmenting the training images with artificial occlusions has been\nproved as a useful approach. However, these artificial occlusions are commonly\ngenerated by adding a black rectangle or several object templates including\nsunglasses, scarfs and phones, which cannot well simulate the realistic\nocclusions. In this paper, based on the argument that the occlusion essentially\ndamages a group of neurons, we propose a novel and elegant occlusion-simulation\nmethod via dropping the activations of a group of neurons in some elaborately\nselected channel. Specifically, we first employ a spatial regularization to\nencourage each feature channel to respond to local and different face regions.\nIn this way, the activations affected by an occlusion in a local region are\nmore likely to be located in a single feature channel. Then, the locality-aware\nchannel-wise dropout (LCD) is designed to simulate the occlusion by dropping\nout the entire feature channel. Furthermore, by randomly dropping out several\nfeature channels, our method can well simulate the occlusion of larger area.\nThe proposed LCD can encourage its succeeding layers to minimize the\nintra-class feature variance caused by occlusions, thus leading to improved\nrobustness against occlusion. In addition, we design an auxiliary spatial\nattention module by learning a channel-wise attention vector to reweight the\nfeature channels, which improves the contributions of non-occluded regions.\nExtensive experiments on various benchmarks show that the proposed method\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods with a remarkable improvement.",

    "abstract": "In the synthesis of distributed systems, we automate the development of\ndistributed programs and hardware by automatically deriving correct\nimplementations from formal specifications. For synchronous distributed\nsystems, the synthesis problem is well known to be undecidable. For\nasynchronous systems, the boundary between decidable and undecidable synthesis\nproblems is a long-standing open question. We study the problem in the setting\nof Petri games, a framework for distributed systems where asynchronous\nprocesses are equipped with causal memory. Petri games extend Petri nets with a\ndistinction between system places and environment places. The components of a\ndistributed system are the players of the game, represented as tokens that\nexchange information during each synchronization. Previous decidability results\nfor this model are limited to local winning conditions, i.e., conditions that\nonly refer to individual components. In this paper, we consider global winning\nconditions such as mutual exclusion, i.e., conditions that refer to the state\nof all components. We provide decidability and undecidability results for\nglobal winning conditions. First, we prove for winning conditions given as bad\nmarkings that it is decidable whether a winning strategy for the system players\nexists in Petri games with a bounded number of system players and one\nenvironment player. Second, we prove for winning conditions that refer to both\ngood and bad markings that it is undecidable whether a winning strategy for the\nsystem players exists in Petri games with at least two system players and one\nenvironment player. Our results thus show that, on the one hand, it is indeed\npossible to use global safety specifications like mutual exclusion in the\nsynthesis of distributed systems. However, on the other hand, adding global\nliveness specifications results in an undecidable synthesis problem for almost\nall Petri games.",

    "abstract": "Although virtual agents are increasingly situated in environments where\nnatural language is the most effective mode of interaction with humans, these\nexchanges are rarely used as an opportunity for learning. Leveraging language\ninteractions effectively requires addressing limitations in the two most common\napproaches to language grounding: semantic parsers built on top of fixed object\ncategories are precise but inflexible and end-to-end models are maximally\nexpressive, but fickle and opaque. Our goal is to develop a system that\nbalances the strengths of each approach so that users can teach agents new\ninstructions that generalize broadly from a single example. We introduce the\nidea of neural abstructions: a set of constraints on the inference procedure of\na label-conditioned generative model that can affect the meaning of the label\nin context. Starting from a core programming language that operates over\nabstructions, users can define increasingly complex mappings from natural\nlanguage to actions. We show that with this method a user population is able to\nbuild a semantic parser for an open-ended house modification task in Minecraft.\nThe semantic parser that results is both flexible and expressive: the\npercentage of utterances sourced from redefinitions increases steadily over the\ncourse of 191 total exchanges, achieving a final value of 28%.",

Many natural\nlanguage processing techniques, such as word2vec, RNN and self-attention, have\nbeen adapted for use in hierarchical and time stamped EHR data, but fail when\nthey lack either general or task-specific data. Hence, some recent works train\nhealthcare representations by incorporating medical ontology (a.k.a. knowledge\ngraph), by self-supervised tasks like diagnosis prediction, but (1) the\nsmall-scale, monotonous ontology is insufficient for robust learning, and (2)\ncritical contexts or dependencies underlying patient journeys are never\nexploited to enhance ontology learning. To address this, we propose an\nend-to-end robust Transformer-based solution, Mutual Integration of patient\njourney and Medical Ontology (MIMO) for healthcare representation learning and\npredictive analytics. Specifically, it consists of task-specific representation\nlearning and graph-embedding modules to learn both patient journey and medical\nontology interactively. Consequently, this creates a mutual integration to\nbenefit both healthcare representation learning and medical ontology embedding.\nMoreover, such integration is achieved by a joint training of both\ntask-specific predictive and ontology-based disease typing tasks based on fused\nembeddings of the two modules.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks often have a huge number of parameters, which posts\nchallenges in deployment in application scenarios with limited memory and\ncomputation capacity. Knowledge distillation is one approach to derive compact\nmodels from bigger ones. However, it has been observed that a converged heavy\nteacher model is strongly constrained for learning a compact student network\nand could make the optimization subject to poor local optima. In this paper, we\npropose ProKT, a new model-agnostic method by projecting the supervision\nsignals of a teacher model into the student's parameter space. Such projection\nis implemented by decomposing the training objective into local intermediate\ntargets with an approximate mirror descent technique. The proposed method could\nbe less sensitive with the quirks during optimization which could result in a\nbetter local optimum. Experiments on both image and text datasets show that our\nproposed ProKT consistently achieves superior performance compared to other\nexisting knowledge distillation methods.",

With the increasing demand of fast iteration and complexity of\nbusiness logic, it is challenging to achieve rapid development and continuous\ndelivery in such highly distributed cloud and edge computing environment. At\npresent, microservice-based architecture has been the dominant deployment\nstyle, and a microservice system has to evolve agilely to offer stable Quality\nof Service (QoS) in the situation where user requirement changes frequently.\nMany research have been conducted to optimally re-deploy microservices to adapt\nto changing requirements. Nevertheless, complex dependencies between\nmicroservices and the existence of multiple instances of one single\nmicroservice in a microservice system have not been fully considered in\nexisting works. This paper defines SPPMS, the Service Placement Problem in\nMicroservice Systems that feature complex dependencies and multiple instances,\nas a Fractional Polynomial Problem (FPP) . Considering the high computation\ncomplexity of FPP, it is then transformed into a Quadratic Sum-of-Ratios\nFractional Problem (QSRFP) which is further solved by the proposed greedy-based\nalgorithms.

In this work, we study a different type of stochastic\ngradient estimator: the Measure-Valued Derivative. This estimator is unbiased,\nhas low variance, and can be used with differentiable and non-differentiable\nfunction approximators. We empirically evaluate this estimator in the\nactor-critic policy gradient setting and show that it can reach comparable\nperformance with methods based on the likelihood-ratio or reparametrization\ntricks, both in low and high-dimensional action spaces.",

    "abstract": "Recent Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) managed to deliver superhuman accuracy\nlevels on many AI tasks. Several applications rely more and more on DNNs to\ndeliver sophisticated services and DNN accelerators are becoming integral\ncomponents of modern systems-on-chips. DNNs perform millions of arithmetic\noperations per inference and DNN accelerators integrate thousands of\nmultiply-accumulate units leading to increased energy requirements. Approximate\ncomputing principles are employed to significantly lower the energy consumption\nof DNN accelerators at the cost of some accuracy loss. Nevertheless, recent\nresearch demonstrated that complex DNNs are increasingly sensitive to\napproximation. Hence, the obtained energy savings are often limited when\ntargeting tight accuracy constraints. In this work, we present a dynamically\nconfigurable approximate multiplier that supports three operation modes, i.e.,\nexact, positive error, and negative error. In addition, we propose a\nfilter-oriented approximation method to map the weights to the appropriate\nmodes of the approximate multiplier. Our mapping algorithm balances the\npositive with the negative errors due to the approximate multiplications,\naiming at maximizing the energy reduction while minimizing the overall\nconvolution error. We evaluate our approach on multiple DNNs and datasets\nagainst state-of-the-art approaches, where our method achieves 18.33% energy\ngains on average across 7 NNs on 4 different datasets for a maximum accuracy\ndrop of only 1%.",

The receive IQI imbalance compensation is realized using two\nDNNs at the receiver, one DNN for explicit estimation of receive gain and phase\nimbalances and another DNN for compensation.

    "abstract": "The class of $k$-star caterpillar convex bipartite graphs generalizes the\nclass of convex bipartite graphs. For a bipartite graph with partitions $X$ and\n$Y$, we associate a $k$-star caterpillar on $X$ such that for each vertex in\n$Y$, its neighborhood induces a tree. The $k$-star caterpillar on $X$ is\nimaginary and if the imaginary structure is a path ($0$-star caterpillar), then\nit is the class of convex bipartite graphs. The minimum Steiner tree problem\n(STREE) is defined as follows: given a connected graph $G=(V,E)$ and a subset\nof vertices $R \\subseteq V(G)$, the objective is to find a minimum cardinality\nset $S \\subseteq V(G)$ such that the set $R \\cup S$ induces a connected\nsubgraph. STREE is known to be NP-complete on general graphs as well as for\nspecial graph classes such as chordal graphs, bipartite graphs, and chordal\nbipartite graphs. The complexity of STREE in convex bipartite graphs, which is\na popular subclass of chordal bipartite graphs, is open. In this paper, we\nintroduce $k$-star caterpillar convex bipartite graphs, and show that STREE is\nNP-complete for $1$-star caterpillar convex bipartite graphs and\npolynomial-time solvable for $0$-star caterpillar convex bipartite graphs (also\nknown as convex bipartite graphs). In \\cite{muller1987np}, it is shown that\nSTREE in chordal bipartite graphs is NP-complete. A close look at the reduction\ninstances reveal that the instances are $3$-star caterpillar convex bipartite\ngraphs, and in this paper, we strengthen the result of \\cite{muller1987np}.",

A popular approach to modeling SELD jointly is using\nconvolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) models, where CNNs learn\nhigh-level features from multi-channel audio input and the RNNs learn temporal\nrelationships from these high-level features. However, RNNs have some\ndrawbacks, such as a limited capability to model long temporal dependencies and\nslow training and inference times due to their sequential processing nature.\nRecently, a few SELD studies used multi-head self-attention (MHSA), among other\ninnovations in their models. MHSA and the related transformer networks have\nshown state-of-the-art performance in various domains. While they can model\nlong temporal dependencies, they can also be parallelized efficiently. In this\npaper, we study in detail the effect of MHSA on the SELD task. Specifically, we\nexamined the effects of replacing the RNN blocks with self-attention layers.

    "abstract": "Fault localization is to identify faulty source code. It could be done on\nvarious granularities, e.g., classes, methods, and statements. Most of the\nautomated fault localization (AFL) approaches are coarse-grained because it is\nchallenging to accurately locate fine-grained faulty software elements, e.g.,\nstatements. SBFL, based on dynamic execution of test cases only, is simple,\nintuitive, and generic (working on various granularities). However, its\naccuracy deserves significant improvement. To this end, in this paper, we\npropose a hybrid fine-grained AFL approach based on both dynamic spectrums and\nstatic statement types. The rationale of the approach is that some types of\nstatements are significantly more/less error-prone than others, and thus\nstatement types could be exploited for fault localization. On a crop of faulty\nprograms, we compute the error-proneness for each type of statements, and\nassign priorities to special statement types that are steadily more/less\nerror-prone than others. For a given faulty program under test, we first\nleverage traditional spectrum-based fault localization algorithm to identify\nall suspicious statements and to compute their suspicious scores. For each of\nthe resulting suspicious statements, we retrieve its statement type as well as\nthe special priority associated with the type. The final suspicious score is\nthe product of the SBFL suspicious score and the priority assigned to the\nstatement type. A significant advantage of the approach is that it is simple\nand intuitive, making it efficient and easy to interpret/implement. We evaluate\nthe proposed approach on widely used benchmark Defects4J. The evaluation\nresults suggest that the proposed approach outperforms widely used SBFL,\nreducing the absolute waste effort (AWE) by 9.3% on average.",

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved tremendous success for cognitive\napplications. The core operation in a DNN is the dot product between quantized\ninputs and weights. Prior works exploit the weight/input repetition that arises\ndue to quantization to avoid redundant computations in Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs). However, in this paper we show that their effectiveness is\nseverely limited when applied to Fully-Connected (FC) layers, which are\ncommonly used in state-of-the-art DNNs, as it is the case of modern Recurrent\nNeural Networks (RNNs) and Transformer models.\nTo improve energy-efficiency of FC computation we present CREW, a hardware\naccelerator that implements Computation Reuse and an Efficient Weight Storage\nmechanism to exploit the large number of repeated weights in FC layers. CREW\nfirst performs the multiplications of the unique weights by their respective\ninputs and stores the results in an on-chip buffer. The storage requirements\nare modest due to the small number of unique weights and the relatively small\nsize of the input compared to convolutional layers. Next, CREW computes each\noutput by fetching and adding its required products. To this end, each weight\nis replaced offline by an index in the buffer of unique products. Indices are\ntypically smaller than the quantized weights, since the number of unique\nweights for each input tends to be much lower than the range of quantized\nweights, which reduces storage and memory bandwidth requirements.\nOverall, CREW greatly reduces the number of multiplications and provides\nsignificant savings in model memory footprint and memory bandwidth usage. We\nevaluate CREW on a diverse set of modern DNNs. On average, CREW provides 2.61x\nspeedup and 2.42x energy savings over a TPU-like accelerator.

    "abstract": "While named entity recognition (NER) is a key task in natural language\nprocessing, most approaches only target flat entities, ignoring nested\nstructures which are common in many scenarios. Most existing nested NER methods\ntraverse all sub-sequences which is both expensive and inefficient, and also\ndon't well consider boundary knowledge which is significant for nested\nentities. In this paper, we propose a joint entity mention detection and typing\nmodel via prior boundary knowledge (BoningKnife) to better handle nested NER\nextraction and recognition tasks. BoningKnife consists of two modules,\nMentionTagger and TypeClassifier. MentionTagger better leverages boundary\nknowledge beyond just entity start/end to improve the handling of nesting\nlevels and longer spans, while generating high quality mention candidates.\nTypeClassifier utilizes a two-level attention mechanism to decouple different\nnested level representations and better distinguish entity types. We jointly\ntrain both modules sharing a common representation and a new dual-info\nattention layer, which leads to improved representation focus on entity-related\ninformation. Experiments over different datasets show that our approach\noutperforms previous state of the art methods and achieves 86.41, 85.46, and\n94.2 F1 scores on ACE2004, ACE2005, and NNE, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The success of deep neural networks in real-world problems has prompted many\nattempts to explain their training dynamics and generalization performance, but\nmore guiding principles for the training of neural networks are still needed.\nMotivated by the edge of chaos principle behind the optimal performance of\nneural networks, we study the role of various hyperparameters in modern neural\nnetwork training algorithms in terms of the order-chaos phase diagram. In\nparticular, we study a fully analytical feedforward neural network trained on\nthe widely adopted Fashion-MNIST dataset, and study the dynamics associated\nwith the hyperparameters in back-propagation during the training process. We\nfind that for the basic algorithm of stochastic gradient descent with momentum,\nin the range around the commonly used hyperparameter values, clear scaling\nrelations are present with respect to the training time during the ordered\nphase in the phase diagram, and the model's optimal generalization power at the\nedge of chaos is similar across different training parameter combinations. In\nthe chaotic phase, the same scaling no longer exists. The scaling allows us to\nchoose the training parameters to achieve faster training without sacrificing\nperformance. In addition, we find that the commonly used model regularization\nmethod - weight decay - effectively pushes the model towards the ordered phase\nto achieve better performance. Leveraging on this fact and the scaling\nrelations in the other hyperparameters, we derived a principled guideline for\nhyperparameter determination, such that the model can achieve optimal\nperformance by saturating it at the edge of chaos. Demonstrated on this simple\nneural network model and training algorithm, our work improves the\nunderstanding of neural network training dynamics, and can potentially be\nextended to guiding principles of more complex model architectures and\nalgorithms.",

These compute- and\nmemory-constrained parallel architectures need to run efficiently a wide range\nof algorithms, including key Non-Neural ML kernels that compete favorably with\nDeep Neural Networks (DNNs) in terms of accuracy under severe resource\nconstraints. In this paper, we focus on enabling efficient parallel execution\nof Non-Neural ML algorithms on two RISCV-based PULP platforms, namely GAP8, a\ncommercial chip, and PULP-OPEN, a research platform running on an FPGA\nemulator. We optimized the parallel algorithms through a fine-grained analysis\nand intensive optimization to maximize the speedup, considering two alternative\nFloating-Point (FP) emulation libraries on GAP8 and the native FPU support on\nPULP-OPEN. Experimental results show that a target-optimized emulation library\ncan lead to an average 1.61x runtime improvement compared to a standard\nemulation library, while the native FPU support reaches up to 32.09x. In terms\nof parallel speedup, our design improves the sequential execution by 7.04x on\naverage on the targeted octa-core platforms.

Static Learned Indexes have been very\nsuccessful in achieving such a speed-up, but leave open a major question: To\nwhat extent one can enjoy the speed-up of Learned Indexes while using constant\nor nearly constant additional space. By generalizing the experimental\nmethodology of a recent benchmarking study on Learned Indexes, we shed light on\nthis question, by considering two scenarios.

The goal is to select a set $C\\subseteq F$ of $k$ centers and assign\neach point in $P$ to a center in $C$, such that the maximum load over all\ncenters is minimized. Here the load of a center is the sum of the distances\nbetween it and the points assigned to it.\nAlthough clustering/facility location problems have a rich literature, the\nminimum-load objective is not studied substantially, and hence MLkC has\nremained a poorly understood problem. More interestingly, the problem is\nnotoriously hard even in some special cases including the one in line metrics\nas shown by Ahmadian et al. [ACM Trans. Algo. 2018]. They also show\nAPX-hardness of the problem in the plane. On the other hand, the best-known\napproximation factor for MLkC is $O(k)$, even in the plane.\nIn this work, we study a fair version of MLkC inspired by the work of\nChierichetti et al. [NeurIPS, 2017], which generalizes MLkC. Here the input\npoints are colored by one of the $\\ell$ colors denoting the group they belong\nto. MLkC is the special case with $\\ell=1$. Considering this problem, we are\nable to obtain a $3$-approximation in $f(k,\\ell)\\cdot n^{O(1)}$ time. Also, our\nscheme leads to an improved $(1 + \\epsilon)$-approximation in case of Euclidean\nnorm, and in this case, the running time depends only polynomially on the\ndimension $d$. Our results imply the same approximations for MLkC with running\ntime $f(k)\\cdot n^{O(1)}$, achieving the first constant approximations for this\nproblem in general and Euclidean metric spaces.",

    "abstract": "Computational intelligence-based ocean characteristics forecasting\napplications, such as Significant Wave Height (SWH) prediction, are crucial for\navoiding social and economic loss in coastal cities. Compared to the\ntraditional empirical-based or numerical-based forecasting models, \"soft\ncomputing\" approaches, including machine learning and deep learning models,\nhave shown numerous success in recent years. In this paper, we focus on\nenabling the deep learning model to learn both short-term and long-term\nspatial-temporal dependencies for SWH prediction. A Wavelet Graph Neural\nNetwork (WGNN) approach is proposed to integrate the advantages of wavelet\ntransform and graph neural network. Several parallel graph neural networks are\nseparately trained on wavelet decomposed data, and the reconstruction of each\nmodel's prediction forms the final SWH prediction.

    "abstract": "Friction systems are mechanical systems wherein friction is used for force\ntransmission (e.g. mechanical braking systems or automatic gearboxes). For\nfinding optimal and safe design parameters, engineers have to predict friction\nsystem performance. This is especially difficult in real-world applications,\nbecause it is affected by many parameters. We have used symbolic regression and\ngenetic programming for finding accurate and trustworthy prediction models for\nthis task. However, it is not straight-forward how nominal variables can be\nincluded. In particular, a one-hot-encoding is unsatisfactory because genetic\nprogramming tends to remove such indicator variables. We have therefore used\nso-called factor variables for representing nominal variables in symbolic\nregression models. Our results show that GP is able to produce symbolic\nregression models for predicting friction performance with predictive accuracy\nthat is comparable to artificial neural networks. The symbolic regression\nmodels with factor variables are less complex than models using a one-hot\nencoding.",

This paper\nexplains what is 'twined' in supply chain digital twin and how to 'twin' them\nto handle the spatio-temporal dynamic issue. A supply chain digital twin\nframework is developed based on the theories of system of systems and supply\nchain operations reference model. This framework is universal and can be\napplied in various types of supply chain systems. We firstly decompose the\nsupply chain system into unified standard blocks preparing for the adoption of\ndigital twin. Next, the idea of supply chain operations reference model is\nadopted to digitise basic supply chain activities within each block and explain\nhow to use existing information system. Then, individual sub-digital twin is\nestablished for each member in supply chain system. After that, we apply the\nconcept of system of systems to integrate and coordinate sub-digital twin into\nsupply chain digital twin from the views of supply chain business integration\nand information system integration. At last, one simple supply chain system is\napplied to illustrate the application of the proposed model.",

New mechanisms able to encode, generate,\nevaluate, and deform aesthetic curves are expected to improve the throughput\nand the quality of industrial design. In recent years, the study of (log)\naesthetic curves have attracted the community's attention due to its ubiquity\nin natural phenomena such as bird eggs, butterfly wings, falcon flights, and\nmanufactured products such as Japanese swords and automobiles.\nA (log) aesthetic curve renders a logarithmic curvature graph approximated by\na straight line, and polar aesthetic curves enable to mode user-defined\ndynamics of the polar tangential angle in the polar coordinate system. As such,\nthe curvature profile often becomes a by-product of the tangential angle.\nIn this paper, we extend the concept of polar aesthetic curves and establish\nthe analytical formulations to construct aesthetic curves with user-defined\ncriteria. In particular, we propose the closed-form analytic characterizations\nof polar log-aesthetic curves meeting user-defined criteria of curvature\nprofiles and dynamics of polar tangential angles. We present numerical examples\nportraying the feasibility of rendering the logarithmic curvature graphs\nrepresented by a straight line.

We aim to maximize the\nvideo quality while keeping rebuffering time small via encoding rate adaptation\nat each group of pictures (GOP) and transmission adaptation at each\n(transmission) slot. To capture the impact of field-of-view (FoV) prediction,\nwe consider three cases of FoV viewing probability distributions, i.e.,\nperfect, imperfect, and unknown FoV viewing probability distributions, and use\nthe average total utility, worst average total utility, and worst total utility\nas the respective performance metrics. In the single-user scenario, we optimize\nthe encoding rates of the tiles, encoding rates of the FoVs, and transmission\nbeamforming vectors for all subcarriers to maximize the total utility in each\ncase. In the multi-user scenario, we adopt rate splitting with successive\ndecoding and optimize the encoding rates of the tiles, encoding rates of the\nFoVs, rates of the common and private messages, and transmission beamforming\nvectors for all subcarriers to maximize the total utility in each case. Then,\nwe separate the challenging optimization problem into multiple tractable\nproblems in each scenario. In the single-user scenario, we obtain a globally\noptimal solution of each problem using transformation techniques and the\nKarush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. In the multi-user scenario, we obtain a\nKKT point of each problem using the concave-convex procedure (CCCP). Finally,\nnumerical results demonstrate that the proposed solutions achieve notable gains\nover existing schemes in all three cases. To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first work revealing the impact of FoV prediction on the performance of\nadaptive streaming of tiled 360 videos.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are under threat from adversarial example\nattacks. The adversary can easily change the outputs of DNNs by adding small\nwell-designed perturbations to inputs. Adversarial example detection is a\nfundamental work for robust DNNs-based service. Adversarial examples show the\ndifference between humans and DNNs in image recognition. From a human-centric\nperspective, image features could be divided into dominant features that are\ncomprehensible to humans, and recessive features that are incomprehensible to\nhumans, yet are exploited by DNNs. In this paper, we reveal that imperceptible\nadversarial examples are the product of recessive features misleading neural\nnetworks, and an adversarial attack is essentially a kind of method to enrich\nthese recessive features in the image. The imperceptibility of the adversarial\nexamples indicates that the perturbations enrich recessive features, yet hardly\naffect dominant features. Therefore, adversarial examples are sensitive to\nfiltering off recessive features, while benign examples are immune to such\noperation. Inspired by this idea, we propose a label-only adversarial detection\napproach that is referred to as feature-filter. Feature-filter utilizes\ndiscrete cosine transform to approximately separate recessive features from\ndominant features, and gets a mutant image that is filtered off recessive\nfeatures. By only comparing DNN's prediction labels on the input and its\nmutant, feature-filter can real-time detect imperceptible adversarial examples\nat high accuracy and few false positives.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has recently emerged as a promising technology to\nenable artificial intelligence (AI) at the network edge, where distributed\nmobile devices collaboratively train a shared AI model under the coordination\nof an edge server. To significantly improve the communication efficiency of FL,\nover-the-air computation allows a large number of mobile devices to\nconcurrently upload their local models by exploiting the superposition property\nof wireless multi-access channels. Due to wireless channel fading, the model\naggregation error at the edge server is dominated by the weakest channel among\nall devices, causing severe straggler issues. In this paper, we propose a\nrelay-assisted cooperative FL scheme to effectively address the straggler\nissue. In particular, we deploy multiple half-duplex relays to cooperatively\nassist the devices in uploading the local model updates to the edge server. The\nnature of the over-the-air computation poses system objectives and constraints\nthat are distinct from those in traditional relay communication systems.\nMoreover, the strong coupling between the design variables renders the\noptimization of such a system challenging. To tackle the issue, we propose an\nalternating-optimization-based algorithm to optimize the transceiver and relay\noperation with low complexity. Then, we analyze the model aggregation error in\na single-relay case and show that our relay-assisted scheme achieves a smaller\nerror than the one without relays provided that the relay transmit power and\nthe relay channel gains are sufficiently large. The analysis provides critical\ninsights on relay deployment in the implementation of cooperative FL.

    "abstract": "One of the leading university goals is to provide the students with the\nnecessary skills for better functioning in their future studies. Gaining and\ndeveloping skills, both technical and soft skills, are the critical building\nblocks for a successful career. The traditional teaching process, which\nincludes delivering lectures and conducting exams, emphasizes the upliftment of\ntechnical knowledge rather than building self-esteem and enhancing skills\ndevelopment among students. Development of non-technical skills like\nself-esteem, life-long learning among students is vital for a successful\ncareer. This paper targets to achieve the objective of identifying ways to\nempower students with non-technical skills along with technical skills. The\napproach adopted in this research work is to transform the delivery of a\nfaculty-wide course from teaching to coaching. One salient difference between\nteaching and coaching is to move students motivation away from grades towards\nlife-long learning. Thus, university students maximize skills through coaching\nlike course structure, course delivery, course assessment, and student\ninvolvement. As a case study, the proposed approach was successfully tested and\nvalidated on a course taught in the Faculty of Computing and Information\nTechnology (FCIT) at King Abdulaziz University (KAU). The outcome of this case\nstudy reveals that there is substantial potential towards enhancement of\nself-responsibility.

However, there is a lack of research to predict takeover time by\nconsidering these factors all at the same time. Toward this end, we used\neXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to predict the takeover time using a\ndataset from a meta-analysis study [1]. In addition, we used SHAP (SHapley\nAdditive exPlanation) to analyze and explain the effects of the predictors on\ntakeover time. We identified seven most critical predictors that resulted in\nthe best prediction performance. Their main effects and interaction effects on\ntakeover time were examined. The results showed that the proposed approach\nprovided both good performance and explainability. Our findings have\nimplications on the design of in-vehicle monitoring and alert systems to\nfacilitate the interaction between the drivers and the automated vehicle.",

To ensure that fundamental principles such as beneficence, respect for\nhuman autonomy, prevention of harm, justice, privacy, and transparency are\nrespected, medical machine learning applications must be developed responsibly.\nIn this paper, we survey the technical challenges involved in creating medical\nmachine learning systems responsibly and in conformity with existing\nregulations, as well as possible solutions to address these challenges. We\nbegin by providing a brief overview of existing regulations affecting medical\nmachine learning, showing that properties such as safety, robustness,\nreliability, privacy, security, transparency, explainability, and\nnondiscrimination are all demanded already by existing law and regulations -\nalbeit, in many cases, to an uncertain degree. Next, we discuss the underlying\ntechnical challenges, possible ways for addressing them, and their respective\nmerits and drawbacks. We notice that distribution shift, spurious correlations,\nmodel underspecification, and data scarcity represent severe challenges in the\nmedical context (and others) that are very difficult to solve with classical\nblack-box deep neural networks. Important measures that may help to address\nthese challenges include the use of large and representative datasets and\nfederated learning as a means to that end, the careful exploitation of domain\nknowledge wherever feasible, the use of inherently transparent models,\ncomprehensive model testing and verification, as well as stakeholder inclusion.",

We factor out regularly reoccurring\ntraffic phenomena, such as rush hours, mainly induced by the daytime, by\nmodelling and systematically exploiting temporal traffic load outliers.

In this work, we systematically construct train-test splits of\nincreasing difficulty and present the ooDML benchmark to characterize\ngeneralization under out-of-distribution shifts in DML. ooDML is designed to\nprobe the generalization performance on much more challenging, diverse\ntrain-to-test distribution shifts.

    "abstract": "Humans build 3D understandings of the world through active object\nexploration, using jointly their senses of vision and touch. However, in 3D\nshape reconstruction, most recent progress has relied on static datasets of\nlimited sensory data such as RGB images, depth maps or haptic readings, leaving\nthe active exploration of the shape largely unexplored. In active touch sensing\nfor 3D reconstruction, the goal is to actively select the tactile readings that\nmaximize the improvement in shape reconstruction accuracy. However, the\ndevelopment of deep learning-based active touch models is largely limited by\nthe lack of frameworks for shape exploration. In this paper, we focus on this\nproblem and introduce a system composed of: 1) a haptic simulator leveraging\nhigh spatial resolution vision-based tactile sensors for active touching of 3D\nobjects; 2) a mesh-based 3D shape reconstruction model that relies on tactile\nor visuotactile signals; and 3) a set of data-driven solutions with either\ntactile or visuotactile priors to guide the shape exploration. Our framework\nenables the development of the first fully data-driven solutions to active\ntouch on top of learned models for object understanding. Our experiments show\nthe benefits of such solutions in the task of 3D shape understanding where our\nmodels consistently outperform natural baselines.

Intuitively, problems and challenges can be better handled by managing\nexpectations in software teams. Aim: Our goal is to understand whether the\nexpectations of software developers vary towards diverse stakeholders in\nsoftware teams. Method: We surveyed 181 professional software developers to\nunderstand their expectations from five different stakeholders: (1)\norganizations, (2) managers, (3) peers, (4) new hires, and (5) government and\neducational institutions. The five stakeholders are determined by conducting\nsemi-formal interviews of software developers. We ask open-ended survey\nquestions and analyze the responses using open coding. Results: We observed 18\nmulti-faceted expectations types. While some expectations are more specific to\na stakeholder, other expectations are cross-cutting. For example, developers\nexpect work-benefits from their organizations, but expect the adoption of\nstandard software engineering (SE) practices from their organizations, peers,\nand new hires. Conclusion: Out of the 18 categories, three categories are\nrelated to career growth. This observation supports previous research that\nhappiness cannot be assured by simply offering more money or a promotion. Among\nthe most number of responses, we find expectations from educational\ninstitutions to offer relevant teaching and from governments to improve job\nstability, which indicate the increasingly important roles of these\norganizations to help software developers.

Generic reinforcement learning agents could be\ntrained to behave altruistically towards others by rewarding them for\naltruistic behaviour, i.e., rewarding them for benefiting other agents in a\ngiven situation. Such an approach assumes that other agents' goals are known so\nthat the altruistic agent can cooperate in achieving those goals. However,\nexplicit knowledge of other agents' goals is often difficult to acquire. Even\nassuming such knowledge to be given, training of altruistic agents would\nrequire manually-tuned external rewards for each new environment. Thus, it is\nbeneficial to develop agents that do not depend on external supervision and can\nlearn altruistic behaviour in a task-agnostic manner. Assuming that other\nagents rationally pursue their goals, we hypothesize that giving them more\nchoices will allow them to pursue those goals better. Some concrete examples\ninclude opening a door for others or safeguarding them to pursue their\nobjectives without interference. We formalize this concept and propose an\naltruistic agent that learns to increase the choices another agent has by\nmaximizing the number of states that the other agent can reach in its future.\nWe evaluate our approach on three different multi-agent environments where\nanother agent's success depends on the altruistic agent's behaviour.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation aims to adapt\na segmentation model trained on the labeled source domain to the unlabeled\ntarget domain. Existing methods try to learn domain invariant features while\nsuffering from large domain gaps that make it difficult to correctly align\ndiscrepant features, especially in the initial training phase. To address this\nissue, we propose a novel Dual Soft-Paste (DSP) method in this paper.\nSpecifically, DSP selects some classes from a source domain image using a\nlong-tail class first sampling strategy and softly pastes the corresponding\nimage patch on both the source and target training images with a fusion weight.\nTechnically, we adopt the mean teacher framework for domain adaptation, where\nthe pasted source and target images go through the student network while the\noriginal target image goes through the teacher network. Output-level alignment\nis carried out by aligning the probability maps of the target fused image from\nboth networks using a weighted cross-entropy loss. In addition, feature-level\nalignment is carried out by aligning the feature maps of the source and target\nimages from student network using a weighted maximum mean discrepancy loss. DSP\nfacilitates the model learning domain-invariant features from the intermediate\ndomains, leading to faster convergence and better performance.

    "abstract": "Detecting customized moments and highlights from videos given natural\nlanguage (NL) user queries is an important but under-studied topic. One of the\nchallenges in pursuing this direction is the lack of annotated data. To address\nthis issue, we present the Query-based Video Highlights (QVHighlights) dataset.\nIt consists of over 10,000 YouTube videos, covering a wide range of topics,\nfrom everyday activities and travel in lifestyle vlog videos to social and\npolitical activities in news videos. Each video in the dataset is annotated\nwith: (1) a human-written free-form NL query, (2) relevant moments in the video\nw.r.t. the query, and (3) five-point scale saliency scores for all\nquery-relevant clips. This comprehensive annotation enables us to develop and\nevaluate systems that detect relevant moments as well as salient highlights for\ndiverse, flexible user queries. We also present a strong baseline for this\ntask, Moment-DETR, a transformer encoder-decoder model that views moment\nretrieval as a direct set prediction problem, taking extracted video and query\nrepresentations as inputs and predicting moment coordinates and saliency scores\nend-to-end. While our model does not utilize any human prior, we show that it\nperforms competitively when compared to well-engineered architectures. With\nweakly supervised pretraining using ASR captions, Moment-DETR substantially\noutperforms previous methods. Lastly, we present several ablations and\nvisualizations of Moment-DETR.

    "abstract": "Testing with simulation environments helps to identify critical failing\nscenarios emerging autonomous systems such as self-driving cars (SDCs) and are\nsafer than in-field operational tests. However, these tests are very expensive\nand are too many to be run frequently within limited time constraints. In this\npaper, we investigate test case prioritization techniques to increase the\nability to detect SDC regression faults with virtual tests earlier. Our\napproach, called SDC-Prioritizer, prioritizes virtual tests for SDCs according\nto static features of the roads used within the driving scenarios. These\nfeatures are collected without running the tests and do not require past\nexecution results. SDC-Prioritizer utilizes meta-heuristics to prioritize the\ntest cases using diversity metrics (black-box heuristics) computed on these\nstatic features. Our empirical study conducted in the SDC domain shows that\nSDC-Prioritizer doubles the number of safety-critical failures that virtual\ntests can detect at the same level of execution time compared to baselines:\nrandom and greedy-based test case orderings. Furthermore, this meta-heuristic\nsearch performs statistically better than both baselines in terms of detecting\nsafety-critical failures. SDC-Prioritizer effectively prioritize test cases for\nSDCs with a large improvement in fault detection while its overhead (up to\n0.34% of the test execution cost) is negligible.",

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a promising technology to\nimprove the band-utilization efficiency via spectrum sharing or hardware\nsharing between radar and communication systems. Since a common radio resource\nbudget is shared by both functionalities, there exists a tradeoff between the\nsensing and communication performance. However, this tradeoff curve is\ncurrently unknown in ISAC systems with human motion recognition tasks based on\ndeep learning. To fill this gap, this paper formulates and solves a\nmulti-objective optimization problem which simultaneously maximizes the\nrecognition accuracy and the communication data rate. The key ingredient of\nthis new formulation is a nonlinear recognition accuracy model with respect to\nthe wireless resources, where the model is derived from power function\nregression of the system performance of the deep spectrogram network. To avoid\ncost-expensive data collection procedures, a primitive-based autoregressive\nhybrid (PBAH) channel model is developed, which facilitates efficient training\nand testing dataset generation for human motion recognition in a virtual\nenvironment. Extensive results demonstrate that the proposed wireless\nrecognition accuracy and PBAH channel models match the actual experimental data\nvery well. Moreover, it is found that the accuracy-rate region consists of a\ncommunication saturation zone, a sensing saturation zone, and a\ncommunication-sensing adversarial zone, of which the third zone achieves the\ndesirable balanced performance for ISAC systems.",

    "abstract": "A medical dialogue system is essential for healthcare service as providing\nprimary clinical advice and diagnoses. It has been gradually adopted and\npracticed in medical organizations in the form of a conversational bot, largely\ndue to the advancement of NLP. In recent years, the introduction of\nstate-of-the-art deep learning models and transfer learning techniques like\nUniversal Language Model Fine Tuning (ULMFiT) and Knowledge Distillation (KD)\nlargely contributes to the performance of NLP tasks. However, some deep neural\nnetworks are poorly calibrated and wrongly estimate the uncertainty. Hence the\nmodel is not trustworthy, especially in sensitive medical decision-making\nsystems and safety tasks. In this paper, we investigate the well-calibrated\nmodel for ULMFiT and self-distillation (SD) in a medical dialogue system. The\ncalibrated ULMFiT (CULMFiT) is obtained by incorporating label smoothing (LS),\na commonly used regularization technique to achieve a well-calibrated model.\nMoreover, we apply the technique to recalibrate the confidence score called\ntemperature scaling (TS) with KD to observe its correlation with network\ncalibration. To further understand the relation between SD and calibration, we\nuse both fixed and optimal temperatures to fine-tune the whole model. All\nexperiments are conducted on the consultation backpain dataset collected by\nexperts then further validated using a large publicly medial dialogue corpus.\nWe empirically show that our proposed methodologies outperform conventional\nmethods in terms of accuracy and robustness.",

    "title": "Learning to Share Autonomy Across Repeated Interaction",
    "abstract": "Wheelchair-mounted robotic arms (and other assistive robots) should help\ntheir users perform everyday tasks. One way robots can provide this assistance\nis shared autonomy. Within shared autonomy, both the human and robot maintain\ncontrol over the robot's motion: as the robot becomes confident it understands\nwhat the human wants, it increasingly intervenes to automate the task. But how\ndoes the robot know what tasks the human may want to perform in the first\nplace? Today's shared autonomy approaches often rely on prior knowledge: for\nexample, the robot must know the set of possible human goals a priori. In the\nlong-term, however, this prior knowledge will inevitably break down -- sooner\nor later the human will reach for a goal that the robot did not expect. In this\npaper we propose a learning approach to shared autonomy that takes advantage of\nrepeated interactions. Learning to assist humans would be impossible if they\nperformed completely different tasks at every interaction: but our insight is\nthat users living with physical disabilities repeat important tasks on a daily\nbasis (e.g., opening the fridge, making coffee, and having dinner). We\nintroduce an algorithm that exploits these repeated interactions to recognize\nthe human's task, replicate similar demonstrations, and return control when\nunsure. As the human repeatedly works with this robot, our approach continually\nlearns to assist tasks that were never specified beforehand: these tasks\ninclude both discrete goals (e.g., reaching a cup) and continuous skills (e.g.,\nopening a drawer). Across simulations and an in-person user study, we\ndemonstrate that robots leveraging our approach match existing shared autonomy\nmethods for known goals, and outperform imitation learning baselines on new\ntasks.

    "abstract": "Elasticity is one important feature in modern cloud computing systems and can\nresult in computation failure or significantly increase computing time. Such\nelasticity means that virtual machines over the cloud can be preempted under a\nshort notice (e.g., hours or minutes) if a high-priority job appears; on the\nother hand, new virtual machines may become available over time to compensate\nthe computing resources. Coded Storage Elastic Computing (CSEC) introduced by\nYang et al. in 2018 is an effective and efficient approach to overcome the\nelasticity and it costs relatively less storage and computation load. However,\none of the limitations of the CSEC is that it may only be applied to certain\ntypes of computations (e.g., linear) and may be challenging to be applied to\nmore involved computations because the coded data storage and approximation are\noften needed. Hence, it may be preferred to use uncoded storage by directly\ncopying data into the virtual machines. In addition, based on our own\nmeasurement, virtual machines on Amazon EC2 clusters often have heterogeneous\ncomputation speed even if they have exactly the same configurations (e.g., CPU,\nRAM, I/O cost). In this paper, we introduce a new optimization framework on\nUncoded Storage Elastic Computing (USEC) systems with heterogeneous computing\nspeed to minimize the overall computation time. Under this framework, we\npropose optimal solutions of USEC systems with or without straggler tolerance\nusing different storage placements.

    "abstract": "AI in finance broadly refers to the applications of AI techniques in\nfinancial businesses. This area has been lasting for decades with both classic\nand modern AI techniques applied to increasingly broader areas of finance,\neconomy and society. In contrast to either discussing the problems, aspects and\nopportunities of finance that have benefited from specific AI techniques and in\nparticular some new-generation AI and data science (AIDS) areas or reviewing\nthe progress of applying specific techniques to resolving certain financial\nproblems, this review offers a comprehensive and dense roadmap of the\noverwhelming challenges, techniques and opportunities of AI research in finance\nover the past decades. The landscapes and challenges of financial businesses\nand data are firstly outlined, followed by a comprehensive categorization and a\ndense overview of the decades of AI research in finance. We then structure and\nillustrate the data-driven analytics and learning of financial businesses and\ndata. The comparison, criticism and discussion of classic vs. modern AI\ntechniques for finance are followed.

    "abstract": "The stock market has been a popular topic of interest in the recent past. The\ngrowth in the inflation rate has compelled people to invest in the stock and\ncommodity markets and other areas rather than saving. Further, the ability of\nDeep Learning models to make predictions on the time series data has been\nproven time and again. Technical analysis on the stock market with the help of\ntechnical indicators has been the most common practice among traders and\ninvestors. One more aspect is the sentiment analysis - the emotion of the\ninvestors that shows the willingness to invest. A variety of techniques have\nbeen used by people around the globe involving basic Machine Learning and\nNeural Networks. Ranging from the basic linear regression to the advanced\nneural networks people have experimented with all possible techniques to\npredict the stock market. It's evident from recent events how news and\nheadlines affect the stock markets and cryptocurrencies. This paper proposes an\nensemble of state-of-the-art methods for predicting stock prices. Firstly\nsentiment analysis of the news and the headlines for the company Apple Inc,\nlisted on the NASDAQ is performed using a version of BERT, which is a\npre-trained transformer model by Google for Natural Language Processing (NLP).\nAfterward, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) predicts the stock price for\nApple Inc using the technical indicators, stock indexes of various countries,\nsome commodities, and historical prices along with the sentiment scores.\nComparison is done with baseline models like - Long Short Term Memory (LSTM),\nGated Recurrent Units (GRU), vanilla GAN, and Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving\nAverage (ARIMA) model.",

    "abstract": "Physiological motion, such as cardiac and respiratory motion, during Magnetic\nResonance (MR) image acquisition can cause image artifacts. Motion correction\ntechniques have been proposed to compensate for these types of motion during\nthoracic scans, relying on accurate motion estimation from undersampled\nmotion-resolved reconstruction. A particular interest and challenge lie in the\nderivation of reliable non-rigid motion fields from the undersampled\nmotion-resolved data. Motion estimation is usually formulated in image space\nvia diffusion, parametric-spline, or optical flow methods. However, image-based\nregistration can be impaired by remaining aliasing artifacts due to the\nundersampled motion-resolved reconstruction. In this work, we describe a\nformalism to perform non-rigid registration directly in the sampled Fourier\nspace, i.e. k-space. We propose a deep-learning based approach to perform fast\nand accurate non-rigid registration from the undersampled k-space data. The\nbasic working principle originates from the Local All-Pass (LAP) technique, a\nrecently introduced optical flow-based registration. The proposed LAPNet is\ncompared against traditional and deep learning image-based registrations and\ntested on fully-sampled and highly-accelerated (with two undersampling\nstrategies) 3D respiratory motion-resolved MR images in a cohort of 40 patients\nwith suspected liver or lung metastases and 25 healthy subjects. The proposed\nLAPNet provided consistent and superior performance to image-based approaches\nthroughout different sampling trajectories and acceleration factors.",

    "abstract": "The two leading hypotheses for the Galactic Center Excess (GCE) in the\n$\\textit{Fermi}$ data are an unresolved population of faint millisecond pulsars\n(MSPs) and dark-matter (DM) annihilation. The dichotomy between these\nexplanations is typically reflected by modeling them as two separate emission\ncomponents. However, point-sources (PSs) such as MSPs become statistically\ndegenerate with smooth Poisson emission in the ultra-faint limit (formally\nwhere each source is expected to contribute much less than one photon on\naverage), leading to an ambiguity that can render questions such as whether the\nemission is PS-like or Poissonian in nature ill-defined. We present a\nconceptually new approach that describes the PS and Poisson emission in a\nunified manner and only afterwards derives constraints on the Poissonian\ncomponent from the so obtained results. For the implementation of this\napproach, we leverage deep learning techniques, centered around a neural\nnetwork-based method for histogram regression that expresses uncertainties in\nterms of quantiles. We demonstrate that our method is robust against a number\nof systematics that have plagued previous approaches, in particular DM / PS\nmisattribution. In the $\\textit{Fermi}$ data, we find a faint GCE described by\na median source-count distribution (SCD) peaked at a flux of $\\sim4 \\times\n10^{-11} \\ \\text{counts} \\ \\text{cm}^{-2} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}$ (corresponding to\n$\\sim3 - 4$ expected counts per PS), which would require $N \\sim\n\\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ sources to explain the entire excess (median value $N =\n\\text{29,300}$ across the sky). Although faint, this SCD allows us to derive\nthe constraint $\\eta_P \\leq 66\\%$ for the Poissonian fraction of the GCE flux\n$\\eta_P$ at 95% confidence, suggesting that a substantial amount of the GCE\nflux is due to PSs.",

    "abstract": "The observed sub-structures, like annular gaps, in dust emissions from\nprotoplanetary disk, are often interpreted as signatures of embedded planets.\nFitting a model of planetary gaps to these observed features using customized\nsimulations or empirical relations can reveal the characteristics of the hidden\nplanets. However, customized fitting is often impractical owing to the\nincreasing sample size and the complexity of disk-planet interaction. In this\npaper we introduce the architecture of DPNNet-2.0, second in the series after\nDPNNet \\citep{aud20}, designed using a Convolutional Neural Network ( CNN, here\nspecifically ResNet50) for predicting exoplanet masses directly from simulated\nimages of protoplanetary disks hosting a single planet. DPNNet-2.0 additionally\nconsists of a multi-input framework that uses both a CNN and multi-layer\nperceptron (a class of artificial neural network) for processing image and disk\nparameters simultaneously. This enables DPNNet-2.0 to be trained using images\ndirectly, with the added option of considering disk parameters (disk\nviscosities, disk temperatures, disk surface density profiles, dust abundances,\nand particle Stokes numbers) generated from disk-planet hydrodynamic\nsimulations as inputs. This work provides the required framework and is the\nfirst step towards the use of computer vision (implementing CNN) to directly\nextract mass of an exoplanet from planetary gaps observed in dust-surface\ndensity maps by telescopes such as the Atacama Large (sub-)Millimeter Array.",

Moreover, interpretable models are concise and often yield\ncomputational efficiency. Here, we propose adaptive wavelet distillation (AWD),\na method which aims to distill information from a trained neural network into a\nwavelet transform. Specifically, AWD penalizes feature attributions of a neural\nnetwork in the wavelet domain to learn an effective multi-resolution wavelet\ntransform. The resulting model is highly predictive, concise, computationally\nefficient, and has properties (such as a multi-scale structure) which make it\neasy to interpret. In close collaboration with domain experts, we showcase how\nAWD addresses challenges in two real-world settings: cosmological parameter\ninference and molecular-partner prediction. In both cases, AWD yields a\nscientifically interpretable and concise model which gives predictive\nperformance better than state-of-the-art neural networks. Moreover, AWD\nidentifies predictive features that are scientifically meaningful in the\ncontext of respective domains.

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art 2D image compression schemes rely on the power of\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs). Although CNNs offer promising\nperspectives for 2D image compression, extending such models to omnidirectional\nimages is not straightforward. First, omnidirectional images have specific\nspatial and statistical properties that can not be fully captured by current\nCNN models. Second, basic mathematical operations composing a CNN architecture,\ne.g., translation and sampling, are not well-defined on the sphere. In this\npaper, we study the learning of representation models for omnidirectional\nimages and propose to use the properties of HEALPix uniform sampling of the\nsphere to redefine the mathematical tools used in deep learning models for\nomnidirectional images. In particular, we: i) propose the definition of a new\nconvolution operation on the sphere that keeps the high expressiveness and the\nlow complexity of a classical 2D convolution; ii) adapt standard CNN techniques\nsuch as stride, iterative aggregation, and pixel shuffling to the spherical\ndomain; and then iii) apply our new framework to the task of omnidirectional\nimage compression. Our experiments show that our proposed on-the-sphere\nsolution leads to a better compression gain that can save 13.7% of the bit rate\ncompared to similar learned models applied to equirectangular images. Also,\ncompared to learning models based on graph convolutional networks, our solution\nsupports more expressive filters that can preserve high frequencies and provide\na better perceptual quality of the compressed images. Such results demonstrate\nthe efficiency of the proposed framework, which opens new research venues for\nother omnidirectional vision tasks to be effectively implemented on the sphere\nmanifold.",

A\nrecent line of research promises to show that the optimum of the CV loss\nmatches the optimum of the out-of-sample loss (possibly after simple\ncorrections). It remains to show how tractable it is to minimize the CV loss.\nIn the present paper, we show that, in the case of ridge regression, the CV\nloss may fail to be quasiconvex and thus may have multiple local optima. We can\nguarantee that the CV loss is quasiconvex in at least one case: when the\nspectrum of the covariate matrix is nearly flat and the noise in the observed\nresponses is not too high. More generally, we show that quasiconvexity status\nis independent of many properties of the observed data (response norm,\ncovariate-matrix right singular vectors and singular-value scaling) and has a\ncomplex dependence on the few that remain.

As an alternative to standard direct injection, we investigate the\neffect of injecting the propellant near the channel exit and directing it\nbackwards, towards the anode. The resulting neutral density and average\nvelocity fields are studied with the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo method for\nboth cold and warm anode conditions. The residence time of neutral particles\ninside the channel and in the ionization region is computed using a\ntest-particle Monte Carlo method. The computations indicate that the reversed\ninjection allows for increasing the mass utilization efficiency of a standard\nfeed configuration from 2-5% to a maximum of 20-30% depending on the initial\nefficiency.",

    "title": "Looking at Euler flows through a contact mirror: Universality and  undecidability",
    "abstract": "The dynamics of an inviscid and incompressible fluid flow on a Riemannian\nmanifold is governed by the Euler equations. In recent papers [5, 6, 7, 8]\nseveral unknown facets of the Euler flows have been discovered, including\nuniversality properties of the stationary solutions to the Euler equations. The\nstudy of these universality features was suggested by Tao as a novel way to\naddress the problem of global existence for Euler and Navier-Stokes [28].\nUniversality of the Euler equations was proved in [7] for stationary solutions\nusing a contact mirror which reflects a Beltrami flow as a Reeb vector field.\nThis contact mirror permits the use of advanced geometric techniques in fluid\ndynamics. On the other hand, motivated by Tao's approach relating Turing\nmachines to Navier-Stokes equations, a Turing complete stationary Euler\nsolution on a Riemannian $3$-dimensional sphere was constructed in [8]. Since\nthe Turing completeness of a vector field can be characterized in terms of the\nhalting problem, which is known to be undecidable [30], a striking consequence\nof this fact is that a Turing complete Euler flow exhibits undecidable particle\npaths [8]. In this article, we give a panoramic overview of this fascinating\nsubject, and go one step further in investigating the undecidability of\ndifferent dynamical properties of Turing complete flows. In particular, we show\nthat variations of [8] allow us to construct a stationary Euler flow of\nBeltrami type (and, via the contact mirror, a Reeb vector field) for which it\nis undecidable to determine whether its orbits through an explicit set of\npoints are periodic.",

    "abstract": "In the context of electroencephalogram (EEG)-based driver drowsiness\nrecognition, it is still a challenging task to design a calibration-free\nsystem, since there exists a significant variability of EEG signals among\ndifferent subjects and recording sessions. As deep learning has received much\nresearch attention in recent years, many efforts have been made to use deep\nlearning methods for EEG signal recognition. However, existing works mostly\ntreat deep learning models as blackbox classifiers, while what have been\nlearned by the models and to which extent they are affected by the noise from\nEEG data are still underexplored. In this paper, we develop a novel\nconvolutional neural network that can explain its decision by highlighting the\nlocal areas of the input sample that contain important information for the\nclassification. The network has a compact structure for ease of interpretation\nand takes advantage of separable convolutions to process the EEG signals in a\nspatial-temporal sequence. Results show that the model achieves an average\naccuracy of 78.35% on 11 subjects for leave-one-out cross-subject drowsiness\nrecognition, which is higher than the conventional baseline methods of\n53.4%-72.68% and state-of-art deep learning methods of 63.90%-65.61%.\nVisualization results show that the model has learned to recognize biologically\nexplainable features from EEG signals, e.g., Alpha spindles, as strong\nindicators of drowsiness across different subjects. In addition, we also\nexplore reasons behind some wrongly classified samples and how the model is\naffected by artifacts and noise in the data. Our work illustrates a promising\ndirection on using interpretable deep learning models to discover meaning\npatterns related to different mental states from complex EEG signals.",

These smart health monitoring systems could be\nrealized in a smart home context to render long-term care to the elderly\npopulation. In this paper, we present the design of a wearable health\nmonitoring system suitable for older adults in a smart home context.

The stress detection\nmodel proposed in this work uses Electrodermal Activity (EDA),\nPhotoplethysmogram (PPG), and Skin Temperature (ST) sensors embedded in a smart\nwristband for detecting physiological stress. The stress detection model is\ntrained and tested using stress labels obtained from salivary cortisol which is\na clinically established biomarker for physiological stress. A voice-based\nprototype is also implemented and the feasibility of the proposed system for\nintegration in a smart home environment is analyzed by simulating a data\nacquisition and streaming scenario. We have also proposed a blood pressure\nestimation model using PPG signal and advanced regression techniques for\nintegration with the stress detection model in the wearable health monitoring\nsystem. Finally, the design of a voice-assisted indoor location system is\nproposed for integration with the proposed system within a smart home\nenvironment.

The description with optimum\npredictive capability for a dataset generated by a physical system is one that\nminimizes both predictive error on the dataset and the complexity of the\ndescription. The discovery of the governing physics of a system can therefore\nbe viewed as a mathematical optimization problem. We outline here a method to\noptimize the description of arbitrarily complex physical systems by minimizing\nthe entropy of the description of the system. The Recursive Domain Partitioning\n(RDP) procedure finds the optimum partitioning of each physical domain into\nsubdomains, and the optimum predictive function within each subdomain.

We introduce SynthSeg, the\nfirst segmentation CNN agnostic to brain MRI scans of any contrast and\nresolution. SynthSeg is trained with synthetic data sampled from a generative\nmodel inspired by Bayesian segmentation. Crucially, we adopt a \\textit{domain\nrandomisation} strategy where we fully randomise the generation parameters to\nmaximise the variability of the training data. Consequently, SynthSeg can\nsegment preprocessed and unpreprocessed real scans of any target domain,\nwithout retraining or fine-tuning. Because SynthSeg only requires segmentations\nto be trained (no images), it can learn from label maps obtained automatically\nfrom existing datasets of different populations (e.g., with atrophy and\nlesions), thus achieving robustness to a wide range of morphological\nvariability. We demonstrate SynthSeg on 5,500 scans of 6 modalities and 10\nresolutions, where it exhibits unparalleled generalisation compared to\nsupervised CNNs, test time adaptation, and Bayesian segmentation.

    "abstract": "Realizing edge intelligence consists of sensing, communication, training, and\ninference stages. Conventionally, the sensing and communication stages are\nexecuted sequentially, which results in excessive amount of dataset generation\nand uploading time. This paper proposes to accelerate edge intelligence via\nintegrated sensing and communication (ISAC). As such, the sensing and\ncommunication stages are merged so as to make the best use of the wireless\nsignals for the dual purpose of dataset generation and uploading. However, ISAC\nalso introduces additional interference between sensing and communication\nfunctionalities. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a\nclassification error minimization formulation to design the ISAC beamforming\nand time allocation. Globally optimal solution is derived via the rank-1\nguaranteed semidefinite relaxation, and performance analysis is performed to\nquantify the ISAC gain. Simulation results are provided to verify the\neffectiveness of the proposed ISAC scheme. Interestingly, it is found that when\nthe sensing time dominates the communication time, ISAC is always beneficial.\nHowever, when the communication time dominates, the edge intelligence with ISAC\nscheme may not be better than that with the conventional scheme, since ISAC\nintroduces harmful interference between the sensing and communication signals.",

The reviews of recent papers indicate that the highest\nclassification accuracy of 99.80% is obtained when InstaCovNet-19 DL method is\napplied to an X-ray dataset of 361 COVID-19 patients, 362 pneumonia patients\nand 365 normal people. Furthermore, it can be seen that the best classification\naccuracy of 99.054% can be achieved when EDL_COVID DL method is applied to a CT\nimage dataset of 7500 samples where COVID-19 patients, lung tumor patients and\nnormal people are equal in number. Moreover, we illustrate the potential DL\ntechniques in drug or vaccine discovery in combating the coronavirus. Finally,\nwe address a number of problems, concerns and future research directions\nrelevant to DL applications for COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "The usual problem for group testing is this: For a given number of\nindividuals and a given prevalence, how many tests T* are required to find\nevery infected individual? In real life, however, the problem is usually\ndifferent: For a given number of individuals, a given prevalence, and a limited\nnumber of tests T much smaller than T*, how can these tests best be used? In\nthis conference paper, we outline some recent results on this problem for two\nmodels. First, the \"practical\" model, which is relevant for screening for\nCOVID-19 and has tests that are highly specific but imperfectly sensitive,\nshows that simple algorithms can be outperformed at low prevalence and high\nsensitivity. Second, the \"theoretical\" model of very low prevalence with\nperfect tests gives interesting new mathematical results.",

    "abstract": "Simulating the dynamics of a nonequilibrium quantum many-body system by\ncomputing the two-time Green's function associated with such a system is\ncomputationally challenging. However, we are often interested in the time\ndiagonal of such a Green's function or time dependent physical observables that\nare functions of one time. In this paper, we discuss the possibility of using\ndynamic model decomposition (DMD), a data-driven model order reduction\ntechnique, to characterize one-time observables associated with the\nnonequilibrium dynamics using snapshots computed within a small time window.\nThe DMD method allows us to efficiently predict long time dynamics from a\nlimited number of trajectory samples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DMD\non a model two-band system. We show that, in the equilibrium limit, the DMD\nanalysis yields results that are consistent with those produced from a linear\nresponse analysis. In the nonequilibrium case, the extrapolated dynamics\nproduced by DMD is more accurate than a special Fourier extrapolation scheme\npresented in this paper. We point out a potential pitfall of the standard DMD\nmethod caused by insufficient spatial/momentum resolution of the discretization\nscheme. We show how this problem can be overcome by using a variant of the DMD\nmethod known as higher order DMD.",

    "abstract": "The lack of studying the complex organization of directed network usually\nlimits to the understanding of underlying relationship between network\nstructures and functions. Structural controllability and structural\npredictability, two seemingly unrelated subjects, are revealed in this paper to\nbe both highly dependent on the critical links previously thought to only be\nable to influence the number of driver nodes in controllable directed networks.\nHere, we show that critical links can not only contribute to structural\ncontrollability, but they can also have a significant impact on the structural\npredictability of networks, suggesting the universal pattern of structural\nreciprocity in directed networks. In addition, it is shown that the fraction\nand location of critical links have a strong influence on the performance of\nprediction algorithms. Moreover, these empirical results are interpreted by\nintroducing the link centrality based on corresponding line graphs. This work\nbridges the gap between the two independent research fields, and it provides\nindications of developing advanced control strategies and prediction algorithms\nfrom a microscopic perspective.",

    "abstract": "A central question in verification is characterizing when a system has\ninvariants of a certain form, and then synthesizing them. We say a system has a\n$k$ linear invariant, $k$-LI in short, if it has a conjunction of $k$ linear\n(non-strict) inequalities -- equivalently, an intersection of $k$ (closed) half\nspaces -- as an invariant. We present a sufficient condition -- solely in terms\nof eigenvalues of the $A$-matrix -- for an $n$-dimensional linear dynamical\nsystem to have a $k$-LI. Our proof of sufficiency is constructive, and we get a\nprocedure that computes a $k$-LI if the condition holds. We also present a\nnecessary condition, together with many example linear systems where either the\nsufficient condition, or the necessary is tight, and which show that the gap\nbetween the conditions is not easy to overcome. In practice, the gap implies\nthat using our procedure, we synthesize $k$-LI for a larger value of $k$ than\nwhat might be necessary. Our result enables analysis of continuous and hybrid\nsystems with linear dynamics in their modes solely using reasoning in the\ntheory of linear arithmetic (polygons), without needing reasoning over\nnonlinear arithmetic (ellipsoids).",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the estimation of a rank-one spiked tensor in the\npresence of heavy tailed noise. Our results highlight some of the fundamental\nsimilarities and differences in the tradeoff between statistical and\ncomputational efficiencies under heavy tailed and Gaussian noise. In\nparticular, we show that, for $p$ th order tensors, the tradeoff manifests in\nan identical fashion as the Gaussian case when the noise has finite $4(p-1)$ th\nmoment. The difference in signal strength requirements, with or without\ncomputational constraints, for us to estimate the singular vectors at the\noptimal rate, interestingly, narrows for noise with heavier tails and vanishes\nwhen the noise only has finite fourth moment. Moreover, if the noise has less\nthan fourth moment, tensor SVD, perhaps the most natural approach, is\nsuboptimal even though it is computationally intractable. Our analysis exploits\na close connection between estimating the rank-one spikes and the spectral norm\nof a random tensor with iid entries. In particular, we show that the order of\nthe spectral norm of a random tensor can be precisely characterized by the\nmoment of its entries, generalizing classical results for random matrices. In\naddition to the theoretical guarantees, we propose estimation procedures for\nthe heavy tailed regime, which are easy to implement and efficient to run.\nNumerical experiments are presented to demonstrate their practical merits.",
