In particular, recent recommendation methods based on graph\nembeddings have shown state-of-the-art performance. In general, these methods\nencode latent rating patterns and content features.

    "title": "A Graph-based Approach for Mitigating Multi-sided Exposure Bias in  Recommender Systems",
    "abstract": "Fairness is a critical system-level objective in recommender systems that has\nbeen the subject of extensive recent research. A specific form of fairness is\nsupplier exposure fairness where the objective is to ensure equitable coverage\nof items across all suppliers in recommendations provided to users. This is\nespecially important in multistakeholder recommendation scenarios where it may\nbe important to optimize utilities not just for the end-user, but also for\nother stakeholders such as item sellers or producers who desire a fair\nrepresentation of their items. This type of supplier fairness is sometimes\naccomplished by attempting to increasing aggregate diversity in order to\nmitigate popularity bias and to improve the coverage of long-tail items in\nrecommendations. In this paper, we introduce FairMatch, a general graph-based\nalgorithm that works as a post processing approach after recommendation\ngeneration to improve exposure fairness for items and suppliers. The algorithm\niteratively adds high quality items that have low visibility or items from\nsuppliers with low exposure to the users' final recommendation lists. A\ncomprehensive set of experiments on two datasets and comparison with\nstate-of-the-art baselines show that FairMatch, while significantly improves\nexposure fairness and aggregate diversity, maintains an acceptable level of\nrelevance of the recommendations.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning solutions for pattern classification problems are nowadays\nwidely deployed in society and industry. However, the lack of transparency and\naccountability of most accurate models often hinders their meaningful and safe\nuse. Thus, there is a clear need for developing explainable artificial\nintelligence mechanisms. There exist model-agnostic methods that summarize\nfeature contributions, but their interpretability is limited to specific\npredictions made by black-box models. An open challenge is to develop models\nthat have intrinsic interpretability and produce their own explanations, even\nfor classes of models that are traditionally considered black boxes like\n(recurrent) neural networks. In this paper, we propose an LTCN-based model for\ninterpretable pattern classification of structured data. Our method brings its\nown mechanism for providing explanations by quantifying the relevance of each\nfeature in the decision process. For supporting the interpretability without\naffecting the performance, the model incorporates more flexibility through a\nquasi-nonlinear reasoning rule that allows controlling nonlinearity. Besides,\nwe propose a recurrence-aware decision model that evades the issues posed by\nunique fixed points while introducing a deterministic learning method to\ncompute the learnable parameters. The simulations show that our interpretable\nmodel obtains competitive performance when compared to the state-of-the-art\nwhite and black boxes.",

Our approach is to predict the interests of the peripheral\nnodes starting from the interests of their influential connections.

    "title": "Comparing ML based Segmentation Models on Jet Fire Radiation Zone",
    "abstract": "Risk assessment is relevant in any workplace, however there is a degree of\nunpredictability when dealing with flammable or hazardous materials so that\ndetection of fire accidents by itself may not be enough. An example of this is\nthe impingement of jet fires, where the heat fluxes of the flame could reach\nnearby equipment and dramatically increase the probability of a domino effect\nwith catastrophic results. Because of this, the characterization of such fire\naccidents is important from a risk management point of view. One such\ncharacterization would be the segmentation of different radiation zones within\nthe flame, so this paper presents an exploratory research regarding several\ntraditional computer vision and Deep Learning segmentation approaches to solve\nthis specific problem. A data set of propane jet fires is used to train and\nevaluate the different approaches and given the difference in the distribution\nof the zones and background of the images, different loss functions, that seek\nto alleviate data imbalance, are also explored. Additionally, different metrics\nare correlated to a manual ranking performed by experts to make an evaluation\nthat closely resembles the expert's criteria. The Hausdorff Distance and\nAdjsted Random Index were the metrics with the highest correlation and the best\nresults were obtained from the UNet architecture with a Weighted Cross-Entropy\nLoss. These results can be used in future research to extract more geometric\ninformation from the segmentation masks or could even be implemented on other\ntypes of fire accidents.",

    "abstract": "A strong visual object tracker nowadays relies on its well-crafted modules,\nwhich typically consist of manually-designed network architectures to deliver\nhigh-quality tracking results. Not surprisingly, the manual design process\nbecomes a particularly challenging barrier, as it demands sufficient prior\nexperience, enormous effort, intuition and perhaps some good luck. Meanwhile,\nneural architecture search has gaining grounds in practical applications such\nas image segmentation, as a promising method in tackling the issue of automated\nsearch of feasible network structures. In this work, we propose a novel\ncell-level differentiable architecture search mechanism to automate the network\ndesign of the tracking module, aiming to adapt backbone features to the\nobjective of a tracking network during offline training. The proposed approach\nis simple, efficient, and with no need to stack a series of modules to\nconstruct a network. Our approach is easy to be incorporated into existing\ntrackers, which is empirically validated using different differentiable\narchitecture search-based methods and tracking objectives. Extensive\nexperimental evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of our approach\nover five commonly-used benchmarks.

Standard methodologies that\nrely solely on the extraction of facial features often fall short of accurate\nemotion prediction in cases where the aforementioned source of affective\ninformation is inaccessible due to head/body orientation, low resolution and\npoor illumination. We aspire to alleviate this problem by leveraging bodily as\nwell as contextual features, as part of a broader emotion recognition\nframework.

Our extensive experiments on the\nchallenging and newly assembled Affect-in-the-wild-2 (Aff-Wild2) dataset verify\nthe superiority of our methods over existing approaches, while by properly\nincorporating all of the aforementioned modules in a network ensemble, we\nmanage to surpass the previous best published recognition scores, in the\nofficial validation set.

    "abstract": "VM startup time is an essential factor in designing elastic cloud\napplications. For example, a cloud application with autoscaling can reduce\nunder- and over-provisioning of VM instances with a precise estimation of VM\nstartup time, and in turn, it is likely to guarantee the application's\nperformance and improve the cost efficiency. However, VM startup time has been\nlittle studied, and available measurement results performed previously did not\nconsider various configurations of VMs for modern cloud applications. In this\nwork, we perform comprehensive measurements and analysis of VM startup time\nfrom two major cloud providers, namely Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google\nCloud Platform (GCP). With three months of measurements, we collected more than\n300,000 data points from each provider by applying a set of configurations,\nincluding 11+ VM types, four different data center locations, four VM image\nsizes, two OS types, and two purchase models (e.g., spot/preemptible VMs vs.\non-demand VMs). With extensive analysis, we found that VM startup time can vary\nsignificantly because of several important factors, such as VM image sizes,\ndata center locations, VM types, and OS types. Moreover, by comparing with\nprevious measurement results, we confirm that cloud providers (specifically\nAWS) made significant improvements for the VM startup times and currently have\nmuch quicker VM startup times than in the past.",

    "abstract": "With the growing awareness to fairness in machine learning and the\nrealization of the central role that data representation has in data processing\ntasks, there is an obvious interest in notions of fair data representations.\nThe goal of such representations is that a model trained on data under the\nrepresentation (e.g., a classifier) will be guaranteed to respect some fairness\nconstraints.\nSuch representations are useful when they can be fixed for training models on\nvarious different tasks and also when they serve as data filtering between the\nraw data (known to the representation designer) and potentially malicious\nagents that use the data under the representation to learn predictive models\nand make decisions.\nA long list of recent research papers strive to provide tools for achieving\nthese goals.\nHowever, we prove that this is basically a futile effort. Roughly stated, we\nprove that no representation can guarantee the fairness of classifiers for\ndifferent tasks trained using it; even the basic goal of achieving\nlabel-independent Demographic Parity fairness fails once the marginal data\ndistribution shifts. More refined notions of fairness, like Odds Equality,\ncannot be guaranteed by a representation that does not take into account the\ntask specific labeling rule with respect to which such fairness will be\nevaluated (even if the marginal data distribution is known a priory).\nFurthermore, except for trivial cases, no representation can guarantee Odds\nEquality fairness for any two different tasks, while allowing accurate label\npredictions for both.\nWhile some of our conclusions are intuitive, we formulate (and prove) crisp\nstatements of such impossibilities, often contrasting impressions conveyed by\nmany recent works on fair representations.",

We preprocess\na given graph $G$ on $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, and a positive integer $f$, to\nconstruct a data structure that, when queried with a set $F$ of $|F| \\leq f$\nedges, returns the diameter of $G-F$.\nFor a single failure ($f=1$) in an unweighted directed graph of diameter $D$,\nthere exists an approximate FDO by Henzinger et al. [ITCS 2017] with stretch\n$(1+\\varepsilon)$, constant query time, space $O(m)$, and a combinatorial\npreprocessing time of $\\widetilde{O}(mn + n^{1.5} \\sqrt{Dm/\\varepsilon})$.We\npresent an FDO for directed graphs with the same stretch, query time, and\nspace.

In this paper,\nwe first develop a cohesive framework of algorithmic decision-making adapted\nfor the public sector (ADMAPS) that reflects the complex socio-technical\ninteractions between \\textit{human discretion}, \\textit{bureaucratic\nprocesses}, and \\textit{algorithmic decision-making} by synthesizing disparate\nbodies of work in the fields of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Science and\nTechnology Studies (STS), and Public Administration (PA).

Overall, we found there is a need to focus on\nstrength-based algorithmic outcomes centered in social ecological frameworks.\nIn addition, algorithmic systems need to support existing bureaucratic\nprocesses and augment human discretion, rather than replace it. Finally,\ncollective buy-in in algorithmic systems requires trust in the target outcomes\nat both the practitioner and bureaucratic levels. As a result of our study, we\npropose guidelines for the design of high-stakes algorithmic decision-making\ntools in the child-welfare system, and more generally, in the public sector.

    "title": "The Influence of Frequency Containment Reserve Flexibilization on the  Economics of Electric Vehicle Fleet Operation",
    "abstract": "Simultaneously with the transformation in the energy system, the spot and\nancillary service markets for electricity have become increasingly flexible\nwith shorter service periods and lower minimum powers. This flexibility has\nmade the fastest form of frequency regulation - the frequency containment\nreserve (FCR) - particularly attractive for large-scale battery storage systems\n(BSSs) and led to a market growth of these systems. However, this growth\nresulted in high competition and consequently falling FCR prices, making the\nFCR market increasingly unattractive to large-scale BSSs. In the context of\nmulti-use concepts, this market may be interesting especially for a pool of\nelectric vehicles (EVs), which can generate additional revenue during their\nidle times. In this paper, multi-year measurement data of 22 commercial EVs are\nused for the development of a simulation model for marketing FCR. In addition,\nlogbooks of more than 460 vehicles of different economic sectors are evaluated.\nBased on the simulations, the effects of flexibilization on the marketing of a\npool of EVs are analyzed for the example of the German FCR market design, which\nis valid for many countries in Europe. It is shown that depending on the\nsector, especially the recently made changes of service periods from one week\nto one day and from one day to four hours generate the largest increase in\navailable pool power. Further reductions in service periods, on the other hand,\noffer only a small advantage, as the idle times are often longer than the short\nservice periods. In principle, increasing flexibility overcompensates for\nfalling FCR prices and leads to higher revenues, even if this does not apply\nacross all sectors examined. A pool of 1,000 EVs could theoretically generate\nrevenues of about 5,000 EUR - 8,000 EUR per week on the German FCR market in\n2020.",

    "abstract": "A selection of intellectual goods produced by online communities - e.g. open\nsource software or knowledge bases like Wikipedia - are in daily use by a broad\naudience, and thus their quality impacts the public at large. Yet, it is still\nunclear what contributes to the effectiveness of such online peer production\nsystems: what conditions or social processes help them deliver quality\nproducts. Specifically, while co-contribution (i.e. bipartite networks) are\noften investigated in online collaboration, the role of interpersonal\ncommunication in coordination of online peer-production is much less\ninvestigated. To address this gap we have reconstructed networks of personal\ncommunication (direct messaging) between Wikipedia editors gathered in so\ncalled Wikiprojects - teams of contributors who focus on articles within\nspecific topical areas. We found that effective projects exchange larger volume\nof direct messages and that their communication structure allows for complex\ncoordination: for sharing of information locally through selective ties, and at\nthe same time globally across the whole group. To verify how these network\nmeasures relate to the subjective perception of importance of group\ncommunication we conducted semi-structured interviews with members of selected\nprojects. Our interviewees used direct communication for providing feedback,\nfor maintaining close relations and for tapping on the social capital of the\nWikipedia community. Our results underscore the importance of communication\nstructure in online collaboration: online peer production communities rely on\ninterpersonal communication to coordinate their work and to maintain high\nlevels of engagement. Design of platforms for such communities should allow for\nample group level communication as well as for one-on-one interactions.",

    "abstract": "We study federated edge learning, where a global model is trained\ncollaboratively using privacy-sensitive data at the edge of a wireless network.\nA parameter server (PS) keeps track of the global model and shares it with the\nwireless edge devices for training using their private local data. The devices\nthen transmit their local model updates, which are used to update the global\nmodel, to the PS. The algorithm, which involves transmission over PS-to-device\nand device-to-PS links, continues until the convergence of the global model or\nlack of any participating devices. In this study, we consider device selection\nbased on downlink channels over which the PS shares the global model with the\ndevices. Performing digital downlink transmission, we design a partial device\nparticipation framework where a subset of the devices is selected for training\nat each iteration. Therefore, the participating devices can have a better\nestimate of the global model compared to the full device participation case\nwhich is due to the shared nature of the broadcast channel with the price of\nupdating the global model with respect to a smaller set of data. At each\niteration, the PS broadcasts different quantized global model updates to\ndifferent participating devices based on the last global model estimates\navailable at the devices. We investigate the best number of participating\ndevices through experimental results for image classification using the MNIST\ndataset with biased distribution.",

To this end, we propose\na novel framework to overcome the limitation of SRSs, named ProxySR, which\nimitates the missing information in SRSs (i.e., general interest of users) by\nmodeling proxies of sessions. ProxySR selects a proxy for the input session in\nan unsupervised manner, and combines it with the encoded short-term interest of\nthe session. As a proxy is jointly learned with the short-term interest and\nselected by multiple sessions, a proxy learns to play the role of the general\ninterest of a user and ProxySR learns how to select a suitable proxy for an\ninput session. Moreover, we propose another real-world situation of SRSs where\na few users are logged-in and leave their identifiers in sessions, and a\nrevision of ProxySR for the situation.

    "abstract": "Data races are among the most common bugs in concurrency. The standard\napproach to data-race detection is via dynamic analyses, which work over\nexecutions of concurrent programs, instead of the program source code. The rich\nliterature on the topic has created various notions of dynamic data races,\nwhich are known to be detected efficiently when certain parameters (e.g.,\nnumber of threads) are small. However, the \\emph{fine-grained} complexity of\nall these notions of races has remained elusive, making it impossible to\ncharacterize their trade-offs between precision and efficiency.\nIn this work we establish several fine-grained separations between many\npopular notions of dynamic data races. The input is an execution trace with $N$\nevents, $T$ threads and $L$ locks. Our main results are as follows. First, we\nshow that happens-before (HB) races can be detected in $O(N\\cdot \\min(T, L))$\ntime, improving over the standard $O(N\\cdot T)$ bound when $L=o(T)$. Moreover,\nwe show that even reporting an HB race that involves a read access is hard for\n2-orthogonal vectors (2-OV). This is the first rigorous proof of the\nconjectured quadratic lower-bound in detecting HB races. Second, we show that\nthe recently introduced synchronization-preserving races are hard to detect for\nOV-3 and thus have a cubic lower bound, when $T=\\Omega(N)$. This establishes a\ncomplexity separation from HB races which are known to be less expressive.\nThird, we show that lock-cover races are hard for 2-OV, and thus have a\nquadratic lower-bound, even when $T=2$ and $L = \\omega(\\log N)$. The similar\nnotion of lock-set races is known to be detectable in $O(N\\cdot L)$ time, and\nthus we achieve a complexity separation between the two. Moreover, we show that\nlock-set races become hitting-set (HS)-hard when $L=\\Theta(N)$, and thus also\nhave a quadratic lower bound, when the input is sufficiently complex.",

    "abstract": "This work investigates the problem of learning temporal interaction networks.\nA temporal interaction network consists of a series of chronological\ninteractions between users and items. Previous methods tackle this problem by\nusing different variants of recurrent neural networks to model sequential\ninteractions, which fail to consider the structural information of temporal\ninteraction networks and inevitably lead to sub-optimal results. To this end,\nwe propose a novel Deep Structural Point Process termed as DSPP for learning\ntemporal interaction networks. DSPP simultaneously incorporates the topological\nstructure and long-range dependency structure into our intensity function to\nenhance model expressiveness. To be specific, by using the topological\nstructure as a strong prior, we first design a topological fusion encoder to\nobtain node embeddings. An attentive shift encoder is then developed to learn\nthe long-range dependency structure between users and items in continuous time.\nThe proposed two modules enable our model to capture the user-item correlation\nand dynamic influence in temporal interaction networks. DSPP is evaluated on\nthree real-world datasets for both tasks of item prediction and time\nprediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves\nconsistent and significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.",

Then, an\nuncertainty-guided learning scheme is proposed to quantitate the uncertainty\nand reduce the negative effect of the noisy samples during optimization for\nbetter performance.

In this paper, unlike the prior methods, we propose a\nRelation-based Pose Semantics Transfer Network (RPSTN) to locate joints\nassociatively. Specifically, we design a lightweight joint relation extractor\n(JRE) to model the pose structural features and associatively generate heatmaps\nfor joints by modeling the relation between any two joints heuristically\ninstead of building each joint heatmap independently. Actually, the proposed\nJRE module models the spatial configuration of human poses through the\nrelationship between any two joints. Moreover, considering the temporal\nsemantic continuity of videos, the pose semantic information in the current\nframe is beneficial for guiding the location of joints in the next frame.\nTherefore, we use the idea of knowledge reuse to propagate the pose semantic\ninformation between consecutive frames. In this way, the proposed RPSTN\ncaptures temporal dynamics of poses. On the one hand, the JRE module can infer\ninvisible joints according to the relationship between the invisible joints and\nother visible joints in space. On the other hand, in the time, the propose\nmodel can transfer the pose semantic features from the non-occluded frame to\nthe occluded frame to locate occluded joints. Therefore, our method is robust\nto the occlusion and achieves state-of-the-art results on the two challenging\ndatasets, which demonstrates its effectiveness for video-based human pose\nestimation.

    "abstract": "Precise localization of polyp is crucial for early cancer screening in\ngastrointestinal endoscopy. Videos given by endoscopy bring both richer\ncontextual information as well as more challenges than still images. The\ncamera-moving situation, instead of the common camera-fixed-object-moving one,\nleads to significant background variation between frames. Severe internal\nartifacts (e.g. water flow in the human body, specular reflection by tissues)\ncan make the quality of adjacent frames vary considerately. These factors\nhinder a video-based model to effectively aggregate features from neighborhood\nframes and give better predictions. In this paper, we present Spatial-Temporal\nFeature Transformation (STFT), a multi-frame collaborative framework to address\nthese issues. Spatially, STFT mitigates inter-frame variations in the\ncamera-moving situation with feature alignment by proposal-guided deformable\nconvolutions. Temporally, STFT proposes a channel-aware attention module to\nsimultaneously estimate the quality and correlation of adjacent frames for\nadaptive feature aggregation. Empirical studies and superior results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and stability of our method.

This\npaper reveals novel geometric laws of optical flow based on the insight and\ndetailed definition of non-occlusion. Then, two novel loss functions are\nproposed for the unsupervised learning of optical flow based on the geometric\nlaws of non-occlusion. Specifically, after the occlusion part of the images are\nmasked, the flowing process of pixels is carefully considered and geometric\nconstraints are conducted based on the geometric laws of optical flow. First,\nneighboring pixels in the first frame will not intersect during the pixel\ndisplacement to the second frame. Secondly, when the cluster containing\nadjacent four pixels in the first frame moves to the second frame, no other\npixels will flow into the quadrilateral formed by them. According to the two\ngeometrical constraints, the optical flow non-intersection loss and the optical\nflow non-blocking loss in the non-occlusion regions are proposed. Two loss\nfunctions punish the irregular and inexact optical flows in the non-occlusion\nregions. The experiments on datasets demonstrated that the proposed\nunsupervised losses of optical flow based on the geometric laws in\nnon-occlusion regions make the estimated optical flow more refined in detail,\nand improve the performance of unsupervised learning of optical flow. In\naddition, the experiments training on synthetic data and evaluating on real\ndata show that the generalization ability of optical flow network is improved\nby our proposed unsupervised approach.",

    "abstract": "Crowd counting is critical for numerous video surveillance scenarios. One of\nthe main issues in this task is how to handle the dramatic scale variations of\npedestrians caused by the perspective effect. To address this issue, this paper\nproposes a novel convolution neural network-based crowd counting method, termed\nPerspective-guided Fractional-Dilation Network (PFDNet). By modeling the\ncontinuous scale variations, the proposed PFDNet is able to select the proper\nfractional dilation kernels for adapting to different spatial locations. It\nsignificantly improves the flexibility of the state-of-the-arts that only\nconsider the discrete representative scales. In addition, by avoiding the\nmulti-scale or multi-column architecture that used in other methods, it is\ncomputationally more efficient. In practice, the proposed PFDNet is constructed\nby stacking multiple Perspective-guided Fractional-Dilation Convolutions (PFC)\non a VGG16-BN backbone. By introducing a novel generalized dilation convolution\noperation, the PFC can handle fractional dilation ratios in the spatial domain\nunder the guidance of perspective annotations, achieving continuous scales\nmodeling of pedestrians. To deal with the problem of unavailable perspective\ninformation in some cases, we further introduce an effective perspective\nestimation branch to the proposed PFDNet, which can be trained in either\nsupervised or weakly-supervised setting once the branch has been pre-trained.\nExtensive experiments show that the proposed PFDNet outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods on ShanghaiTech A, ShanghaiTech B, WorldExpo'10,\nUCF-QNRF, UCF_CC_50 and TRANCOS dataset, achieving MAE 53.8, 6.5, 6.8, 84.3,\n205.8, and 3.06 respectively.",

A MOD-Net is driven by a model to solve PDEs based on operator\nrepresentation with regularization from data. In this work, we use a deep\nneural network to parameterize the Green's function. The empirical risk\nconsists of the mean square of the governing equation, boundary conditions, and\na few labels, which are numerically computed by traditional schemes on coarse\ngrid points with cheap computation cost. With only the labeled dataset or only\nthe model constraints, it is insufficient to accurately train a MOD-Net for\ncomplicate problems. Intuitively, the labeled dataset works as a regularization\nin addition to the model constraints. The MOD-Net is much efficient than\noriginal neural operator because the MOD-Net also uses the information of\ngoverning equation and the boundary conditions of the PDE rather than purely\nthe expensive labels. Since the MOD-Net learns the Green's function of a PDE,\nit solves a type of PDEs but not a specific case. We numerically show MOD-Net\nis very efficient in solving Poisson equation and one-dimensional Boltzmann\nequation.

    "abstract": "Speech evaluation is an essential component in computer-assisted language\nlearning (CALL). While speech evaluation on English has been popular, automatic\nspeech scoring on low resource languages remains challenging. Work in this area\nhas focused on monolingual specific designs and handcrafted features stemming\nfrom resource-rich languages like English. Such approaches are often difficult\nto generalize to other languages, especially if we also want to consider\nsuprasegmental qualities such as rhythm. In this work, we examine three\ndifferent languages that possess distinct rhythm patterns: English\n(stress-timed), Malay (syllable-timed), and Tamil (mora-timed). We exploit\nrobust feature representations inspired by music processing and vector\nrepresentation learning. Empirical validations show consistent gains for all\nthree languages when predicting pronunciation, rhythm and intonation\nperformance.",

While robotics has made tremendous progress in the mechanic design of\nin-pipe inspection robots, the autonomous control of such robots is still a big\nopen challenge due to the high number of actuators and the complex manoeuvres\nrequired. To address this problem, we investigate the usage of Deep\nReinforcement Learning for achieving autonomous navigation of in-pipe robots in\npipeline networks with complex topologies. Moreover, we introduce a\nhierarchical policy decomposition based on Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning\nto learn robust high-level navigation skills.

    "abstract": "The simulation of growth processes within soft biological tissues is of\nutmost importance for many applications in the medical sector. Within this\ncontribution we propose a new macroscopic approach fro modelling stress-driven\nvolumetric growth occurring in soft tissues. Instead of using the standard\napproach of a-priori defining the structure of the growth tensor, we postulate\nthe existance of a general growth potential. Such a potential describes all\neligable homeostatic stress states that can ultimately be reached as a result\nof the growth process. Making use of well established methods from\nvisco-plasticity, the evolution of the growth related right Cauchy-Green tensor\nis subsequently defined as a time dependent associative evolution law with\nrespect to the introduced potential. This approach naturally leads to a\nformulation that is able to cover both, isotropic and anisotropic growth\nrelated changes in geometry. It furthermore allows the model to flexibly adapt\nto changing boundary and loading conditions. Besides the theoretical\ndevelopment, we also describe the algorithmic implementation and furthermore\ncompare the newly derived model with a standard formulation of isotropic\ngrowth.",

    "abstract": "Non-linear model predictive control (nMPC) is a powerful approach to control\ncomplex robots (such as humanoids, quadrupeds, or unmanned aerial manipulators\n(UAMs)) as it brings important advantages over other existing techniques. The\nfull-body dynamics, along with the prediction capability of the optimal control\nproblem (OCP) solved at the core of the controller, allows to actuate the robot\nin line with its dynamics. This fact enhances the robot capabilities and\nallows, e.g., to perform intricate maneuvers at high dynamics while optimizing\nthe amount of energy used. Despite the many similarities between humanoids or\nquadrupeds and UAMs, full-body torque-level nMPC has rarely been applied to\nUAMs.\nThis paper provides a thorough description of how to use such techniques in\nthe field of aerial manipulation. We give a detailed explanation of the\ndifferent parts involved in the OCP, from the UAM dynamical model to the\nresiduals in the cost function. We develop and compare three different nMPC\ncontrollers: Weighted MPC, Rail MPC, and Carrot MPC, which differ on the\nstructure of their OCPs and on how these are updated at every time step. To\nvalidate the proposed framework, we present a wide variety of simulated case\nstudies. First, we evaluate the trajectory generation problem, i.e., optimal\ncontrol problems solved offline, involving different kinds of motions (e.g.,\naggressive maneuvers or contact locomotion) for different types of UAMs. Then,\nwe assess the performance of the three nMPC controllers, i.e., closed-loop\ncontrollers solved online, through a variety of realistic simulations.

    "abstract": "As increasingly more sensitive data is being collected to gain valuable\ninsights, the need to natively integrate privacy controls in data analytics\nframeworks is growing in importance. Today, privacy controls are enforced by\ndata curators with full access to data in the clear. However, a plethora of\nrecent data breaches show that even widely trusted service providers can be\ncompromised. Additionally, there is no assurance that data processing and\nhandling comply with the claimed privacy policies.

This paper presents Zeph, a system that enables users to set privacy\npreferences on how their data can be shared and processed. Zeph enforces\nprivacy policies cryptographically and ensures that data available to\nthird-party applications complies with users' privacy policies. Zeph executes\nprivacy-adhering data transformations in real-time and scales to thousands of\ndata sources, allowing it to support large-scale low-latency data stream\nanalytics.

It offers the flexibility to explore the\ncontext of new clusters formed by an ensemble of algorithms based on internal\nvalidation indices.\nIt is worth mentioning that the input data set is considered to be a cluster\nof clusters. An anomaly can possibly manifest as a cluster as well. Each\npartitioned cluster is considered to be a new data set and is a candidate to\nexplore the most optimal algorithm and its number of partition splits until a\npredefined stopping criteria is met. The algorithms independently partition the\ndata set into clusters and the quality of the partitioning is assessed by an\nensemble of internal cluster validation indices. The 3EC algorithm presents the\nvalidation index scores from a choice of algorithms and its configuration of\npartitions and it is called the Tau Grid. 3EC chooses the most optimal score.\nThe 3EC algorithm owes its name to the two input ensembles of algorithms and\ninternal validation indices and an output ensemble of final clusters.\nQuality plays an important role in this clustering approach and it also acts\nas a stopping criteria from further partitioning. Quality is determined based\non the quality of the clusters provided by an algorithm and its optimal number\nof splits. The 3EC algorithm determines this from the score of the ensemble of\nvalidation indices. The user can configure the stopping criteria by providing\nquality thresholds for the score range of each of the validation indices and\nthe optimal size of the output cluster. The users can experiment with different\nsets of stopping criteria and choose the most 'sensible group' of quality\nclusters",

    "abstract": "As the data scale grows, deep recognition models often suffer from\nlong-tailed data distributions due to the heavy imbalanced sample number across\ncategories. Indeed, real-world data usually exhibit some similarity relation\namong different categories (e.g., pigeons and sparrows), called category\nsimilarity in this work. It is doubly difficult when the imbalance occurs\nbetween such categories with similar appearances. However, existing solutions\nmainly focus on the sample number to re-balance data distribution. In this\nwork, we systematically investigate the essence of the long-tailed problem from\na unified perspective. Specifically, we demonstrate that long-tailed\nrecognition suffers from both sample number and category similarity.\nIntuitively, using a toy example, we first show that sample number is not the\nunique influence factor for performance dropping of long-tailed recognition.\nTheoretically, we demonstrate that (1) category similarity, as an inevitable\nfactor, would also influence the model learning under long-tailed distribution\nvia similar samples, (2) using more discriminative representation methods\n(e.g., self-supervised learning) for similarity reduction, the classifier bias\ncan be further alleviated with greatly improved performance. Extensive\nexperiments on several long-tailed datasets verify the rationality of our\ntheoretical analysis, and show that based on existing state-of-the-arts\n(SOTAs), the performance could be further improved by similarity reduction.

    "abstract": "Representation learning over temporal networks has drawn considerable\nattention in recent years. Efforts are mainly focused on modeling structural\ndependencies and temporal evolving regularities in Euclidean space which,\nhowever, underestimates the inherent complex and hierarchical properties in\nmany real-world temporal networks, leading to sub-optimal embeddings. To\nexplore these properties of a complex temporal network, we propose a hyperbolic\ntemporal graph network (HTGN) that fully takes advantage of the exponential\ncapacity and hierarchical awareness of hyperbolic geometry. More specially,\nHTGN maps the temporal graph into hyperbolic space, and incorporates hyperbolic\ngraph neural network and hyperbolic gated recurrent neural network, to capture\nthe evolving behaviors and implicitly preserve hierarchical information\nsimultaneously. Furthermore, in the hyperbolic space, we propose two important\nmodules that enable HTGN to successfully model temporal networks: (1)\nhyperbolic temporal contextual self-attention (HTA) module to attend to\nhistorical states and (2) hyperbolic temporal consistency (HTC) module to\nensure stability and generalization. Experimental results on multiple\nreal-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of HTGN for temporal graph\nembedding, as it consistently outperforms competing methods by significant\nmargins in various temporal link prediction tasks. Specifically, HTGN achieves\nAUC improvement up to 9.98% for link prediction and 11.4% for new link\nprediction. Moreover, the ablation study further validates the representational\nability of hyperbolic geometry and the effectiveness of the proposed HTA and\nHTC modules.",

    "abstract": "Face recognition approaches often rely on equal image resolution for\nverification faces on two images.

In this work, we first analyze the impact of\nimage resolutions on the face verification performance with a state-of-the-art\nface recognition model. For images, synthetically reduced to $5\\, \\times 5\\,\n\\mathrm{px}$ resolution, the verification performance drops from $99.23\\%$\nincreasingly down to almost $55\\%$. Especially, for cross-resolution image\npairs (one high- and one low-resolution image), the verification accuracy\ndecreases even further. We investigate this behavior more in-depth by looking\nat the feature distances for every 2-image test pair. To tackle this problem,\nwe propose the following two methods: 1) Train a state-of-the-art\nface-recognition model straightforward with $50\\%$ low-resolution images\ndirectly within each batch. \\\\ 2) Train a siamese-network structure and adding\na cosine distance feature loss between high- and low-resolution features.

The reasonable combination\nof quadruplet loss and softmax loss function can reduce the impact of\nimbalance. Experiments on two open datasets are carried out to verify the\neffectiveness and robustness of the model. Experimental results show that the\nproposed method can effectively improve the performance of imbalanced\nclassification.",

    "title": "How to measure things",
    "abstract": "In classical information theory, a causal relationship between two random\nvariables is typically modelled by assuming that, for every possible state of\none of the variables, there exists a particular distribution of states of the\nsecond variable. Let us call these two variables the causal and caused\nvariables, respectively. We assume that both of these random variables are\ncontinuous and one-dimensional. Carrying out independent transformations on the\ncausal and caused variable creates two new random variables. Here, we consider\ntransformations that are differentiable and strictly increasing. We call these\nincreasing transformations. If, for example, the mass of an object is a caused\nvariable, a logarithmic transformation could be applied to produce a new caused\nvariable. Any causal relationship (as defined here) is associated with a\nchannel capacity, which is the maximum rate that information could be sent if\nthe causal relationship was used as a signalling system. Channel capacity is\nunaffected when the variables are changed by use of increasing transformations.\nFor any causal relationship we show that there is always a way to transform the\ncaused variable such that the entropy associated with the caused variable is\nindependent of the value of the causal variable. Furthermore, the resulting\nuniversal entropy has an absolute value that is equal to the channel capacity\nassociated with the causal relationship. This observation may be useful in\nstatistical applications, and it implies that, for any causal relationship,\nthere is a `natural' way to transform a continuous caused variable. With\nadditional constraints on the causal relationship, we show that a natural\ntransformation of both variables can be found such that the transformed system\nbehaves like a good measuring device, with the expected value of the caused\nvariable being approximately equal to the value of the causal variable.",

    "abstract": "In a digraph, a quasi-kernel is a subset of vertices that is independent and\nsuch that every vertex can reach some vertex in that set via a directed path of\nlength at most two. Whereas Chv\\'atal and Lov\\'asz proved in 1974 that every\ndigraph has a quasi-kernel, very little is known so far about the complexity of\nfinding small quasi-kernels. In 1976 Erd\\H{o}s and Sz\\'ekely conjectured that\nevery sink-free digraph $D = (V, A)$ has a quasi-kernel of size at most\n$|V|/2$. Obviously, if $D$ has two disjoint quasi-kernels then it has a\nquasi-kernel of size at most $|V|/2$, and in 2001 Gutin, Koh, Tay and Yeo\nconjectured that every sink-free digraph has two disjoint quasi-kernels. Yet,\nthey constructed in 2004 a counterexample, thereby disproving this stronger\nconjecture. We shall show that, not only sink-free digraphs occasionally fail\nto contain two disjoint quasi-kernels, but it is computationally hard to\ndistinguish those that do from those that do not. We also prove that the\nproblem of computing a small quasi-kernel is polynomial time solvable for\norientations of trees but is computationally hard in most other cases (and in\nparticular for restricted acyclic digraphs).",

    "abstract": "Due to its open-source nature, Android operating system has been the main\ntarget of attackers to exploit. Malware creators always perform different code\nobfuscations on their apps to hide malicious activities. Features extracted\nfrom these obfuscated samples through program analysis contain many useless and\ndisguised features, which leads to many false negatives. To address the issue,\nin this paper, we demonstrate that obfuscation-resilient malware analysis can\nbe achieved through contrastive learning. We take the Android malware\nclassification as an example to demonstrate our analysis. The key insight\nbehind our analysis is that contrastive learning can be used to reduce the\ndifference introduced by obfuscation while amplifying the difference between\nmalware and benign apps (or other types of malware).\nBased on the proposed analysis, we design a system that can achieve robust\nand interpretable classification of Android malware. To achieve robust\nclassification, we perform contrastive learning on malware samples to learn an\nencoder that can automatically extract robust features from malware samples. To\nachieve interpretable classification, we transform the function call graph of a\nsample into an image by centrality analysis. Then the corresponding heatmaps\nare obtained by visualization techniques. These heatmaps can help users\nunderstand why the malware is classified as this family. We implement IFDroid\nand perform extensive evaluations on two widely used datasets. Experimental\nresults show that IFDroid is superior to state-of-the-art Android malware\nfamilial classification systems. Moreover, IFDroid is capable of maintaining\n98.2% true positive rate on classifying 8,112 obfuscated malware samples.",

In\nthis paper, we explore the use of output randomization as a defense against\nattacks in both the black box and white box models and propose two defenses. In\nthe first defense, we propose output randomization at test time to thwart\nfinite difference attacks in black box settings. Since this type of attack\nrelies on repeated queries to the model to estimate gradients, we investigate\nthe use of randomization to thwart such adversaries from successfully creating\nadversarial examples. We empirically show that this defense can limit the\nsuccess rate of a black box adversary using the Zeroth Order Optimization\nattack to 0%. Secondly, we propose output randomization training as a defense\nagainst white box adversaries. Unlike prior approaches that use randomization,\nour defense does not require its use at test time, eliminating the Backward\nPass Differentiable Approximation attack, which was shown to be effective\nagainst other randomization defenses. Additionally, this defense has low\noverhead and is easily implemented, allowing it to be used together with other\ndefenses across various model architectures. We evaluate output randomization\ntraining against the Projected Gradient Descent attacker and show that the\ndefense can reduce the PGD attack's success rate down to 12% when using\ncross-entropy loss.",

Almost all existing works\nrely on item transition patterns, and neglect the impact of user historical\nsessions while modeling user preference, which often leads to non-personalized\nrecommendation. Additionally, existing personalized session-based recommenders\ncapture user preference only based on the sessions of the current user, but\nignore the useful item-transition patterns from other user's historical\nsessions. To address these issues, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Global\nGraph Neural Networks (HG-GNN) to exploit the item transitions over all\nsessions in a subtle manner for better inferring user preference from the\ncurrent and historical sessions. To effectively exploit the item transitions\nover all sessions from users, we propose a novel heterogeneous global graph\nthat contains item transitions of sessions, user-item interactions and global\nco-occurrence items. Moreover, to capture user preference from sessions\ncomprehensively, we propose to learn two levels of user representations from\nthe global graph via two graph augmented preference encoders. Specifically, we\ndesign a novel heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) on the heterogeneous\nglobal graph to learn the long-term user preference and item representations\nwith rich semantics. Based on the HGNN, we propose the Current Preference\nEncoder and the Historical Preference Encoder to capture the different levels\nof user preference from the current and historical sessions, respectively.

    "abstract": "We consider the problems of sampling and counting edges from a graph on $n$\nvertices where our basic access is via uniformly sampled vertices. When we have\na vertex, we can see its degree, and access its neighbors. Eden and Rosenbaum\n[SOSA 2018] have shown it is possible to sample an edge $\\epsilon$-uniformly in\n$O(\\sqrt{1/\\epsilon}\\frac{n}{\\sqrt{m}})$ vertex accesses. Here, we get down to\nexpected $O(\\log(1/\\epsilon)\\frac{n}{\\sqrt{m}})$ vertex accesses. Next, we\nconsider the problem of sampling $s>1$ edges. For this we introduce a model\nthat we call hash-based neighbor access. We show that, w.h.p, we can sample $s$\nedges exactly uniformly at random, with or without replacement, in\n$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{s} \\frac{n}{\\sqrt{m}} + s)$ vertex accesses. We present a\nmatching lower bound of $\\Omega(\\sqrt{s} \\frac{n}{\\sqrt{m}} + s)$ which holds\nfor $\\epsilon$-uniform edge multi-sampling with some constant $\\epsilon>0$ even\nthough our positive result has $\\epsilon=0$.\nWe then give an algorithm for edge counting.

When $\\epsilon$ is not too small (for $\\epsilon \\geq\n\\frac{\\sqrt m}{n}$), we present a near-matching lower-bound of\n$\\Omega(\\frac{n}{\\epsilon \\sqrt{m}})$. In the same range, the previous best\nupper and lower bounds were polynomially worse in $\\epsilon$.\nFinally, we give an algorithm that instead of hash-based neighbor access uses\nthe more standard pair queries (``are vertices $u$ and $v$ adjacent''). W.h.p.\nit returns $1+\\epsilon$ approximation of the number of edges and runs in\nexpected time $\\tilde{O}(\\frac{n}{\\epsilon \\sqrt{m}} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon^4})$.\nThis matches our lower bound when $\\epsilon$ is not too small, specifically for\n$\\epsilon \\geq \\frac{m^{1/6}}{n^{1/3}}$.",

In addition, we propose a novel method that\nutilizes the innovative Prophet model, an end-to-end forecasting tool that\nconsiders several kinds of nonlinear trends in decomposing the energy time\nseries before a tree-based ensemble provides short-term predictions. The\nperformance of the system is measured through representative evaluation\nmetrics, and by estimating the model's generalization under an industryprovided\nscheme of absolute error thresholds. The proposed hybrid model competes with\nbaseline persistence models, tree-based regression ensembles, and the Prophet\nmodel, managing to outperform them, presenting both lower error rates and more\nfavorable error distribution.",

Classical clustering techniques such as K-means, Gaussian mixture\nmodel and spectral clustering are central to many data-driven applications.\nHowever, recently unsupervised simultaneous feature learning and clustering\nusing neural networks also known as Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) has gained\nprominence. Pioneering works on deep feature clustering focus on defining\nrelevant clustering loss function and choosing the right neural network for\nextracting features. A central problem in all these cases is data sparsity\naccompanied by high intra-class and low inter-class variance, which\nsubsequently leads to poor clustering performance and erroneous candidate\nassignments. Towards this, we employ data augmentation techniques to improve\nthe density of the clusters, thus improving the overall performance. We train a\nvariant of Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) with augmented data to construct the\ninitial feature space as a novel model for deep clustering.

    "abstract": "The availability of large amounts of user-provided data has been key to the\nsuccess of machine learning for many real-world tasks. Recently, an increasing\nawareness has emerged that users should be given more control about how their\ndata is used. In particular, users should have the right to prohibit the use of\ntheir data for training machine learning systems, and to have it erased from\nalready trained systems. While several sample erasure methods have been\nproposed, all of them have drawbacks which have prevented them from gaining\nwidespread adoption. Most methods are either only applicable to very specific\nfamilies of models, sacrifice too much of the original model's accuracy, or\nthey have prohibitive memory or computational requirements. In this paper, we\npropose an efficient and effective algorithm, SSSE, for samples erasure, that\nis applicable to a wide class of machine learning models. From a second-order\nanalysis of the model's loss landscape we derive a closed-form update step of\nthe model parameters that only requires access to the data to be erased, not to\nthe original training set. Experiments on three datasets, CelebFaces attributes\n(CelebA), Animals with Attributes 2 (AwA2) and CIFAR10, show that in certain\ncases SSSE can erase samples almost as well as the optimal, yet impractical,\ngold standard of training a new model from scratch with only the permitted\ndata.",

Research\narticles linked to PHM XAI, in English language, from 2015 to 2021 are selected\nfrom IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, ACM Digital Library and Scopus\ndatabases using PRISMA guidelines. Data was extracted from 35 selected articles\nand examined using MS. Excel. Several findings were synthesized. Firstly, while\nthe discipline is still young, the analysis indicates the growing acceptance of\nXAI in PHM domain. Secondly, XAI functions as a double edge sword, where it is\nassimilated as a tool to execute PHM tasks as well as a mean of explanation, in\nparticular in diagnostic and anomaly detection.

Fourthly, human role, explainability metrics and uncertainty management\nare areas requiring further attention by the PHM community.

    "abstract": "A card guessing game is played between two players, Guesser and Dealer. At\nthe beginning of the game, the Dealer holds a deck of $n$ cards (labeled $1,\n..., n$). For $n$ turns, the Dealer draws a card from the deck, the Guesser\nguesses which card was drawn, and then the card is discarded from the deck. The\nGuesser receives a point for each correctly guessed card. With perfect memory,\na Guesser can keep track of all cards that were played so far and pick at\nrandom a card that has not appeared so far, yielding in expectation $\\ln n$\ncorrect guesses. With no memory, the best a Guesser can do will result in a\nsingle guess in expectation. We consider the case of a memory bounded Guesser\nthat has $m < n$ memory bits. We show that the performance of such a memory\nbounded Guesser depends much on the behavior of the Dealer. In more detail, we\nshow that there is a gap between the static case, where the Dealer draws cards\nfrom a properly shuffled deck or a prearranged one, and the adaptive case,\nwhere the Dealer draws cards thoughtfully, in an adversarial manner.\nSpecifically:\n1. We show a Guesser with $O(\\log^2 n)$ memory bits that scores a near\noptimal result against any static Dealer.\n2. We show that no Guesser with $m$ bits of memory can score better than\n$O(\\sqrt{m})$ correct guesses, thus, no Guesser can score better than $\\min\n\\{\\sqrt{m}, \\ln n\\}$, i.e., the above Guesser is optimal.\n3. We show an efficient adaptive Dealer against which no Guesser with $m$\nmemory bits can make more than $\\ln m + 2 \\ln \\log n + O(1)$ correct guesses in\nexpectation.\nThese results are (almost) tight, and we prove them using compression\narguments that harness the guessing strategy for encoding.",

    "abstract": "Perspective-n-Point-and-Line (P$n$PL) algorithms aim at fast, accurate, and\nrobust camera localization with respect to a 3D model from 2D-3D feature\ncorrespondences, being a major part of modern robotic and AR/VR systems.\nCurrent point-based pose estimation methods use only 2D feature detection\nuncertainties, and the line-based methods do not take uncertainties into\naccount. In our setup, both 3D coordinates and 2D projections of the features\nare considered uncertain. We propose PnP(L) solvers based on EPnP and DLS for\nthe uncertainty-aware pose estimation. We also modify motion-only bundle\nadjustment to take 3D uncertainties into account. We perform exhaustive\nsynthetic and real experiments on two different visual odometry datasets. The\nnew PnP(L) methods outperform the state-of-the-art on real data in isolation,\nshowing an increase in mean translation accuracy by 18% on a representative\nsubset of KITTI, while the new uncertain refinement improves pose accuracy for\nmost of the solvers, e.g. decreasing mean translation error for the EPnP by 16%\ncompared to the standard refinement on the same dataset.

    "abstract": "This paper examines how pharmaceutical Artificial Intelligence advancements\nmay affect the development of new drugs in the coming years. The question was\nanswered by reviewing a rich body of source material, including industry\nliterature, research journals, AI studies, market reports, market projections,\ndiscussion papers, press releases, and organizations' websites. The paper\nargues that continued innovation in pharmaceutical AI will enable rapid\ndevelopment of safe and effective therapies for previously untreatable\ndiseases. A series of major points support this conclusion: The pharmaceutical\nindustry is in a significant productivity crisis today, and AI-enabled research\nmethods can be directly applied to reduce the time and cost of drug discovery\nprojects. The industry already reported results such as a 10-fold reduction in\ndrug molecule discovery times. Numerous AI alliances between industry,\ngovernments, and academia enabled utilizing proprietary data and led to\noutcomes such as the largest molecule toxicity database to date or more than\n200 drug safety predictive models. The momentum was recently increased by the\ninvolvement of tech giants combined with record rounds of funding. The\nlong-term effects will range from safer and more effective therapies, through\nthe diminished role of pharmaceutical patents, to large-scale collaboration and\nnew business strategies oriented around currently untreatable diseases. The\npaper notes that while many reviewed resources seem to have overly optimistic\nfuture expectations, even a fraction of these developments would alleviate the\nproductivity crisis. Finally, the paper concludes that the focus on\npharmaceutical AI put the industry on a trajectory towards another significant\ndisruption: open data sharing and collaboration.",

Analyzed\nturbine operates in nuclear power plant while three of four operating regimes\nare obtained by using optimization algorithms - SA (Simplex Algorithm), GA\n(Genetic Algorithm) and IGSA (Improved Genetic-Simplex Algorithm). IGSA\noperating regime gives the highest developed mechanical power of the whole\nturbine equal to 1022.48 MW, followed by GA (1020.06 MW) and SA (1017.16 MW),\nwhile in Original operating regime whole turbine develop mechanical power equal\nto 996.29 MW. In addition, IGSA causes the highest increase in developed\nmechanical power of almost all cylinders and cylinder parts in comparison to\nthe Original operating regime. All observed optimization algorithms increases\nthe exergy destruction of the whole turbine in comparison to Original operating\nregime - the lowest increase causes IGSA, followed by GA and finally SA. The\nhighest exergy efficiency of the whole turbine, equal to 85.92% is obtained by\nIGSA, followed by GA (85.89%) and SA (85.82%), while the lowest exergy\nefficiency is obtained in Original operating regime (85.70%).

    "abstract": "Nearly a decade ago, Azrieli and Shmaya introduced the class of\n$\\lambda$-Lipschitz games in which every player's payoff function is\n$\\lambda$-Lipschitz with respect to the actions of the other players. They\nshowed that such games admit $\\epsilon$-approximate pure Nash equilibria for\ncertain settings of $\\epsilon$ and $\\lambda$. They left open, however, the\nquestion of how hard it is to find such an equilibrium. In this work, we\ndevelop a query-efficient reduction from more general games to Lipschitz games.\nWe use this reduction to show a query lower bound for any randomized algorithm\nfinding $\\epsilon$-approximate pure Nash equilibria of $n$-player,\nbinary-action, $\\lambda$-Lipschitz games that is exponential in\n$\\frac{n\\lambda}{\\epsilon}$. In addition, we introduce ``Multi-Lipschitz\ngames,'' a generalization involving player-specific Lipschitz values, and\nprovide a reduction from finding equilibria of these games to finding\nequilibria of Lipschitz games, showing that the value of interest is the sum of\nthe individual Lipschitz parameters. Finally, we provide an exponential lower\nbound on the deterministic query complexity of finding $\\epsilon$-approximate\ncorrelated equilibria of $n$-player, $m$-action, $\\lambda$-Lipschitz games for\nstrong values of $\\epsilon$, motivating the consideration of explicitly\nrandomized algorithms in the above results.

    "abstract": "In this article, a compliance minimisation scheme for designing spatially\nvarying orthotropic porous structures is proposed. With the utilisation of\nconformal mapping, the porous structures here can be generated by two\ncontrolling field variables, the (logarithm of) the local scaling factor and\nthe rotational angle of the matrix cell, and they are interrelated through the\nCauchy-Riemann equations. Thus the design variables are simply reduced to the\nlogarithm values of the local scaling factor on selected boundary points. Other\nattractive features shown by the present method are summarised as follows.\nFirstly, with the condition of total differential automatically met by the two\ncontrolling field variables, the integrability problem which necessitates\npost-processing treatments in many other similar methods can be resolved\nnaturally. Secondly, according to the maximum principle for harmonic functions,\nthe minimum feature size can be explicitly monitored during optimisation.\nThirdly, the rotational symmetry possessed by the matrix cell can be fully\nexploited in the context of conformal mapping, and the computational cost for\nsolving the cell problems for the homogenised elasticity tensor is maximally\nabased. In particular, when the design domain takes a rectangle shape,\nanalytical expressions for the controlling fields are available. The\nhomogenised results are shown, both theoretically and numerically, to converge\nto the corresponding fine-scale results, and the effectiveness of the proposed\nwork is further demonstrated with more numerical examples.",

For instance, lack of remote-working security\ntraining, heightened stress and anxiety, rushed technology deployment, and the\npresence of untrusted individuals in a remote-working environment (e.g., in\nflatshares), can result in new cyber-risk. Simultaneously, we find that as\norganisations look to manage these and other risks posed by their remote\nworkforces, employee's privacy (including personal information and activities)\nis often compromised.

    "abstract": "Pruning seeks to design lightweight architectures by removing redundant\nweights in overparameterized networks. Most of the existing techniques first\nremove structured sub-networks (filters, channels,...) and then fine-tune the\nresulting networks to maintain a high accuracy. However, removing a whole\nstructure is a strong topological prior and recovering the accuracy, with\nfine-tuning, is highly cumbersome. In this paper, we introduce an \"end-to-end\"\nlightweight network design that achieves training and pruning simultaneously\nwithout fine-tuning. The design principle of our method relies on\nreparametrization that learns not only the weights but also the topological\nstructure of the lightweight sub-network. This reparametrization acts as a\nprior (or regularizer) that defines pruning masks implicitly from the weights\nof the underlying network, without increasing the number of training\nparameters. Sparsity is induced with a budget loss that provides an accurate\npruning.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of allocating $m$ balls into $n$ bins with incomplete\ninformation. In the classical two-choice process, a ball first queries the load\nof $\\textit{two}$ randomly chosen bins and is then placed in the least loaded\nbin. In our setting, each ball also samples two random bins but can only\nestimate a bin's load by sending $\\textit{binary queries}$ of the form \"Is the\nload at least the median?\" or \"Is the load at least $100$?\".\nFor the lightly loaded case $m=O(n)$, one can achieve an $O(\\sqrt{\\log n/\\log\n\\log n})$ maximum load with one query per chosen bin using an oblivious\nstrategy, as shown by Feldheim and Gurel-Gurevich (2018). For the case\n$m=\\Omega(n)$, the authors conjectured that the same strategy achieves a\nmaximum load of $m/n+O(\\sqrt{\\log n/\\log \\log n})$. In this work, we disprove\nthis conjecture by showing a lower bound of $m/n+\\Omega( \\sqrt{\\log n})$ for a\nfixed $m=\\Theta(n \\sqrt{\\log n})$, and a lower bound of $m/n+\\Omega(\\log\nn/\\log\\log n)$ for some $m$ depending on the used strategy. Surprisingly, these\nlower bounds hold even for any $\\textit{adaptive strategy}$ with one query,\ni.e., queries may depend on the full history of the process.\nWe complement this negative result by proving a positive result for multiple\nqueries. In particular, we show that with only two binary queries per chosen\nbin, there is an oblivious strategy which ensures a maximum load of\n$m/n+O(\\sqrt{\\log n})$ whp for any $m \\geq 1$. For any $k=O(\\log \\log n)$\nbinary queries, the upper bound on the maximum load improves to $m/n+O(k(\\log\nn)^{1/k})$ whp for any $m \\geq 1$. Hence for $k=\\Theta(\\log\\log n)$, we recover\nthe two-choice result up to a constant multiplicative factor, including the\nheavily loaded case where $m=\\Omega(n)$. One novel aspect of our proof\ntechniques is the use of multiple super-exponential potential functions, which\nmight be of use in future work.",

In this work, we prove a simple lower bound on the target\ndomain error that complements the existing upper bound.

Our results\nshow that poisoning can significantly decrease the target domain accuracy,\ndropping it to almost 0\\% in some cases, with the addition of only 10\\%\npoisoned data in the source domain.

    "abstract": "Tracking locations is practical and speditive with smartphones, as they are\nomnipresent devices, relatively cheap, and have the necessary sensors for\npositioning and networking integrated in the same box. Nowadays recent models\nhave GNSS antennas capable of receiving multiple constellations. In the\nproposed work we test the hypothesis that GNSS positions directly recorded by\nsmartphones can be a valid solution for spatial analysis of people's behaviour\nin an urban garden. Particular behaviours can be linked to therapeutic spots\nthat promote health and well-being of visitors. Three parts are reported: (i)\nassessment of the accuracy of the positions relative to a reference track, (ii)\nimplementation of a framework for automating transmission and processing of the\nlocation information, (iii) analysis of preferred spots via spatial analytics.\nDifferent devices were used to survey at different times and with different\nmethods, i.e. in the pocket of the owner or on a rigid frame. Accuracy was\nestimated using distance of each located point to the reference track, and\nprecision was estimated with static multiple measures. A chat-bot through the\nTelegram application was implemented to allow users to send their data to a\ncentralized computing environment thus automating the spatial analysis. Results\nreport a horizontal accuracy below ~2.3 m at 95% confidence level, without\nsignificant difference between surveys, and very little differences between\ndevices. GNSS-only and assisted navigation with telephone cells also did not\nshow significant difference. Autocorrelation of the residuals over time and\nspace showed strong consistency of the residuals, thus proving a valid solution\nfor spatial analysis of walking behaviour.",

Under some mild Lov\\'asz local lemma\nconditions where each constraint of the CSP has a small number of forbidden\nlocal configurations, our algorithm is accurate and efficient: it outputs a\nperfect uniform random solution and its expected running time is quasilinear in\nthe number of variables. Prior to our work, perfect samplers are only shown to\nexist for CSPs under much more restrictive conditions (Guo, Jerrum, and Liu,\nJACM'19).\nOur algorithm has two components:\n1. A simple perfect sampling algorithm using bounding chains (Huber, STOC'98;\nHaggstrom and Nelander, Scandinavian Journal of Statistics'99). This sampler is\nefficient if each variable domain is small.\n2. A simple but powerful state tensorization trick to reduce large domains to\nsmaller ones. This trick is a generalization of state compression (Feng, He,\nand Yin, STOC'21).\nThe crux of our analysis is a simple information percolation argument which\nallows us to achieve bounds even beyond current best approximate samplers\n(Jain, Pham, and Vuong, ArXiv'21).\nPrevious related works either use intricate algorithms or need sophisticated\nanalysis or even both. Thus we view the simplicity of both our algorithm and\nanalysis as a strength of our work.",

    "abstract": "Network traffic classification, a task to classify network traffic and\nidentify its type, is the most fundamental step to improve network services and\nmanage modern networks. Classical machine learning and deep learning method\nhave developed well in the field of network traffic classification. However,\nthere are still two major challenges. One is how to protect the privacy of\nusers' traffic data, and the other is that it is difficult to obtain labeled\ndata in reality. In this paper, we propose a novel approach using federated\nsemi-supervised learning for network traffic classification. In our approach,\nthe federated servers and several clients work together to train a global\nclassification model. Among them, unlabeled data is used on the client, and\nlabeled data is used on the server. Moreover, we use two traffic subflow\nsampling methods: simple sampling and incremental sampling for data\npreprocessing. The experimental results in the QUIC dataset show that the\naccuracy of our federated semi-supervised approach can reach 91.08% and 97.81%\nwhen using the simple sampling method and incremental sampling method\nrespectively. The experimental results also show that the accuracy gap between\nour method and the centralized training method is minimal, and it can\neffectively protect users' privacy and does not require a large amount of\nlabeled data.",

    "abstract": "Leveraging the side information associated with entities (i.e.\\ users and\nitems) to enhance the performance of recommendation systems has been widely\nrecognized as an important modelling dimension. While many existing approaches\nfocus on the \\emph{integration scheme} to incorporate entity side information\n-- by combining the recommendation loss function with an extra side\ninformation-aware loss -- in this paper, we propose instead a novel\n\\emph{pre-training scheme} for leveraging the side information. In particular,\nwe first pre-train a representation model using the side information of the\nentities, and then fine-tune it using an existing general representation-based\nrecommendation model. Specifically, we propose two pre-training models, named\n\\gcn{} and \\com{}, by considering the entities and their relations constructed\nfrom side information as two different types of graphs respectively, to\npre-train entity embeddings. For the \\gcn{} model, two single-relational graphs\nare constructed from all the users' and items' side information respectively,\nto pre-train entity representations by using the Graph Convolutional Networks.\nFor the \\com{} model, two multi-relational graphs are constructed to pre-train\nthe entity representations by using the Composition-based Graph Convolutional\nNetworks. An extensive evaluation of our pre-training models fine-tuned under\nfour general representation-based recommender models, i.e.\\ MF, NCF, NGCF and\nLightGCN, shows that effectively pre-training embeddings with both the user's\nand item's side information can significantly improve these original models in\nterms of both effectiveness and stability.",

Meta learning studies how learning systems can increase in\nefficiency through experience and could thus evolve as an important concept to\novercome data sparsity. However, the core capability of meta learning-based\napproaches is the identification of similar previous tasks given a new task - a\nchallenge largely unexplored in the biomedical imaging domain. In this paper,\nwe address the problem of quantifying task similarity with a concept that we\nrefer to as task fingerprinting. The concept involves converting a given task,\nrepresented by imaging data and corresponding labels, to a fixed-length vector\nrepresentation. In fingerprint space, different tasks can be directly compared\nirrespective of their data set sizes, types of labels or specific resolutions.\nAn initial feasibility study in the field of surgical data science (SDS) with\n26 classification tasks from various medical and non-medical domains suggests\nthat task fingerprinting could be leveraged for both (1) selecting appropriate\ndata sets for pretraining and (2) selecting appropriate architectures for a new\ntask.

To achieve the\nreduced computational complexity, we utilize the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)\non a uniform grid of size $N$ for approximating the convolution. To facilitate\nthis and maintain the accuracy, we primarily rely on a periodic Fourier\nextension of the density with a suitably large period depending on the support\nof the density. The rate of convergence of the method increases with increasing\nsmoothness of the periodic extension and, in fact, approximations exhibit\nsuper-algebraic convergence when the extension is infinitely differentiable.\nFurthermore, when the density has jump discontinuities, we utilize a certain\nFourier smoothing technique to accelerate the convergence to achieve the\nquadratic rate in the overall approximation. Finally, we apply the integration\nscheme for numerical solution of certain partial differential equations.\nMoreover, we apply the quadrature to obtain a fast and high-order Nyst\\\"om\nsolver for the solution of the Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation.

Although parameter settings significantly affect the quality of the\nsensor output and the accuracy of insights derived from sensor data, most\nend-users use a fixed parameter setting because they lack the skill or\nunderstanding to appropriately configure these parameters. We propose CamTuner,\nwhich is a system to automatically, and dynamically adapt the complex sensor to\nchanging environments. CamTuner includes two key components. First, a bespoke\nanalytics quality estimator, which is a deep-learning model to automatically\nand continuously estimate the quality of insights from an analytics unit as the\nenvironment around a sensor change. Second, a reinforcement learning (RL)\nmodule, which reacts to the changes in quality, and automatically adjusts the\ncamera parameters to enhance the accuracy of insights. We improve the training\ntime of the RL module by an order of magnitude by designing virtual models to\nmimic essential behavior of the camera: we design virtual knobs that can be set\nto different values to mimic the effects of assigning different values to the\ncamera's configurable parameters, and we design a virtual camera model that\nmimics the output from a video camera at different times of the day. These\nvirtual models significantly accelerate training because (a) frame rates from a\nreal camera are limited to 25-30 fps while the virtual models enable processing\nat 300 fps, (b) we do not have to wait until the real camera sees different\nenvironments, which could take weeks or months, and (c) virtual knobs can be\nupdated instantly, while it can take 200-500 ms to change the camera parameter\nsettings.

The orientation angles computed from these sensors are combined\nusing the sensor fusion methodologies to obtain accurate estimates. The\ncomplementary filter is one of the widely adopted techniques whose performance\nis highly dependent on the appropriate selection of its gain parameters. This\npaper presents a novel cascaded architecture of the complementary filter that\nemploys a nonlinear and linear version of the complementary filter within one\nframework. The nonlinear version is used to correct the gyroscope bias, while\nthe linear version estimates the attitude angle. The significant advantage of\nthe proposed architecture is its independence of the filter parameters, thereby\navoiding tuning the filters gain parameters. The proposed architecture does not\nrequire any mathematical modeling of the system and is computationally\ninexpensive. The proposed methodology is applied to the real-world datasets,\nand the estimation results were found to be promising compared to the other\nstate-of-the-art algorithms.",

    "title": "Offline Meta-Reinforcement Learning with Online Self-Supervision",
    "abstract": "Meta-reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to train policies that quickly\nadapt to new tasks with orders of magnitude less data than standard RL, but\nthis fast adaptation often comes at the cost of greatly increasing the amount\nof reward supervision during meta-training time. Offline meta-RL removes the\nneed to continuously provide reward supervision because rewards must only be\nprovided once when the offline dataset is generated. In addition to the\nchallenges of offline RL, a unique distribution shift is present in meta RL:\nagents learn exploration strategies that can gather the experience needed to\nlearn a new task, and also learn adaptation strategies that work well when\npresented with the trajectories in the dataset, but the adaptation strategies\nare not adapted to the data distribution that the learned exploration\nstrategies collect. Unlike the online setting, the adaptation and exploration\nstrategies cannot effectively adapt to each other, resulting in poor\nperformance. In this paper, we propose a hybrid offline meta-RL algorithm,\nwhich uses offline data with rewards to meta-train an adaptive policy, and then\ncollects additional unsupervised online data, without any ground truth reward\nlabels, to bridge this distribution shift problem. Our method uses the offline\ndata to learn the distribution of reward functions, which is then sampled to\nself-supervise reward labels for the additional online data. By removing the\nneed to provide reward labels for the online experience, our approach can be\nmore practical to use in settings where reward supervision would otherwise be\nprovided manually. We compare our method to prior work on offline meta-RL on\nsimulated robot locomotion and manipulation tasks and find that using\nadditional data and self-generated rewards significantly improves an agent's\nability to generalize.",

    "abstract": "Multiparty session types (MSTs) provide an efficient methodology for\nspecifying and verifying message passing software systems. In the theory of\nMSTs, a global type specifies the interaction among the roles at the global\nlevel. A local specification for each role is generated by projecting from the\nglobal type on to the message exchanges it participates in. Whenever a global\ntype can be projected on to each role, the composition of the projections is\ndeadlock free and has exactly the behaviours specified by the global type. The\nkey to the usability of MSTs is the projection operation: a more expressive\nprojection allows more systems to be type-checked but requires a more difficult\nsoundness argument. In this paper, we generalise the standard projection\noperation in MSTs. This allows us to model and type-check many design patterns\nin distributed systems, such as load balancing, that are rejected by the\nstandard projection. The key to the new projection is an analysis that tracks\ncausality between messages. Our soundness proof uses novel graph-theoretic\ntechniques from the theory of message-sequence charts. We demonstrate the\nefficacy of the new projection operation by showing many global types for\ncommon patterns that can be projected under our projection but not under the\nstandard projection operation.",

While\nlearning-based locomotion has made great advances using RL, most methods still\nrely on domain randomization for training blind agents that generalize to\nchallenging terrains. Our key insight is that proprioceptive states only offer\ncontact measurements for immediate reaction, whereas an agent equipped with\nvisual sensory observations can learn to proactively maneuver environments with\nobstacles and uneven terrain by anticipating changes in the environment many\nsteps ahead. In this paper, we introduce LocoTransformer, an end-to-end RL\nmethod for quadrupedal locomotion that leverages a Transformer-based model for\nfusing proprioceptive states and visual observations. We evaluate our method in\nchallenging simulated environments with different obstacles and uneven terrain.\nWe show that our method obtains significant improvements over policies with\nonly proprioceptive state inputs, and that Transformer-based models further\nimprove generalization across environments.

    "abstract": "To safely navigate unknown environments, robots must accurately perceive\ndynamic obstacles. Instead of directly measuring the scene depth with a LiDAR\nsensor, we explore the use of a much cheaper and higher resolution sensor:\nprogrammable light curtains. Light curtains are controllable depth sensors that\nsense only along a surface that a user selects. We use light curtains to\nestimate the safety envelope of a scene: a hypothetical surface that separates\nthe robot from all obstacles. We show that generating light curtains that sense\nrandom locations (from a particular distribution) can quickly discover the\nsafety envelope for scenes with unknown objects. Importantly, we produce\ntheoretical safety guarantees on the probability of detecting an obstacle using\nrandom curtains. We combine random curtains with a machine learning based model\nthat forecasts and tracks the motion of the safety envelope efficiently. Our\nmethod accurately estimates safety envelopes while providing probabilistic\nsafety guarantees that can be used to certify the efficacy of a robot\nperception system to detect and avoid dynamic obstacles. We evaluate our\napproach in a simulated urban driving environment and a real-world environment\nwith moving pedestrians using a light curtain device and show that we can\nestimate safety envelopes efficiently and effectively.

Moreover, we have incorporated Berenger's\nperfectly matched layer (PML) absorbing boundary condition (ABC) into the\ndispersive formulation to truncate open-domain structures. In general, the LH\nmedium as a kind of dispersive media can be described by frequency-dependent\nconstitutive parameters. The most appropriate numerical techniques for analysis\nof LH media are dispersive formulations of conventional numerical methods. In\ncomparison to the conventional grid-based numerical methods, it is proved that\nmeshless methods not only are strong tools for accurate approximation of\nderivatives in Maxwell's equations but also can provide more flexibility in\nmodeling the spatial domain of problems. However, we have not seen any reports\non using dispersive forms of meshless methods for simulation of wave\npropagation in metamaterials and applying any PML ABCs to dispersive\nformulation of meshless method. The proposed formulation in this paper enables\nus to take advantage of meshless methods in analysis of LH media. For modeling\nthe frequency behavior of the medium in the proposed dispersive formulation, we\nhave used auxiliary differential equation (ADE) method based on the relations\nbetween electromagnetic fields intensities and current densities.

A growing body of research directs this goal towards augmenting the\ncreative writing abilities of human authors. In this paper, we pursue this\nobjective by analyzing how observing examples of automatically generated text\ninfluences writing. In particular, we examine a task referred to as sentence\ninfilling, which involves transforming a list of words into a complete\nsentence. We emphasize \"storiability\" as a desirable feature of the resulting\nsentences, where \"storiable\" sentences are those that suggest a story a reader\nwould be curious to hear about. Both humans and an automated system (based on a\nneural language model) performed this sentence infilling task. In one setting,\npeople wrote sentences on their own; in a different setting, people observed\nthe sentences produced by the model while writing their own sentences. Readers\nthen assigned storiability preferences to the resulting sentences in a\nsubsequent evaluation. We find that human-authored sentences were judged as\nmore storiable when authors observed the generated examples, and that\nstoriability increased as authors derived more semantic content from the\nexamples.

However, since labels for academic performance, such as test\nscores, are collected from outside of ITS, obtaining the labels is costly,\nleading to label-scarcity problem which brings challenge in taking machine\nlearning approaches for academic performance prediction. To this end, inspired\nby the recent advancement of pre-training method in natural language processing\ncommunity, we propose DPA, a transfer learning framework with Discriminative\nPre-training tasks for Academic performance prediction. DPA pre-trains two\nmodels, a generator and a discriminator, and fine-tunes the discriminator on\nacademic performance prediction. In DPA's pre-training phase, a sequence of\ninteractions where some tokens are masked is provided to the generator which is\ntrained to reconstruct the original sequence. Then, the discriminator takes an\ninteraction sequence where the masked tokens are replaced by the generator's\noutputs, and is trained to predict the originalities of all tokens in the\nsequence. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art generative pre-training\nmethod, DPA is more sample efficient, leading to fast convergence to lower\nacademic performance prediction error. We conduct extensive experimental\nstudies on a real-world dataset obtained from a multi-platform ITS application\nand show that DPA outperforms the previous state-of-the-art generative\npre-training method with a reduction of 4.05% in mean absolute error and more\nrobust to increased label-scarcity.",

The XGBoost models identify slippery runway conditions with a ROC AUC\nof 0.95, predict the friction coefficient with a MAE of 0.0254, and outperforms\nall the previous methods. The results show the strong abilities of machine\nlearning methods to model complex, physical phenomena with a good accuracy when\ndomain knowledge is used in the variable extraction. The XGBoost models are\ncombined with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) approximations to provide a\ncomprehensible decision support system for airport operators and pilots, which\ncan contribute to safer and more economic operations of airport runways.",

    "abstract": "Point clouds and RGB images are naturally complementary modalities for 3D\nvisual understanding - the former provides sparse but accurate locations of\npoints on objects, while the latter contains dense color and texture\ninformation. Despite this potential for close sensor fusion, many methods train\ntwo models in isolation and use simple feature concatenation to represent 3D\nsensor data. This separated training scheme results in potentially sub-optimal\nperformance and prevents 3D tasks from being used to benefit 2D tasks that are\noften useful on their own. To provide a more integrated approach, we propose a\nnovel Multi-Modality Task Cascade network (MTC-RCNN) that leverages 3D box\nproposals to improve 2D segmentation predictions, which are then used to\nfurther refine the 3D boxes. We show that including a 2D network between two\nstages of 3D modules significantly improves both 2D and 3D task performance.\nMoreover, to prevent the 3D module from over-relying on the overfitted 2D\npredictions, we propose a dual-head 2D segmentation training and inference\nscheme, allowing the 2nd 3D module to learn to interpret imperfect 2D\nsegmentation predictions. Evaluating our model on the challenging SUN RGB-D\ndataset, we improve upon state-of-the-art results of both single modality and\nfusion networks by a large margin ($\\textbf{+3.8}$ mAP@0.5).

Although synthesis of visually pleasant texture can be achieved by deep\nneural networks, the associated models are large in size, difficult to explain\nin theory, and computationally expensive in training. In contrast, TGHop is\nsmall in its model size, mathematically transparent, efficient in training and\ninference, and able to generate high quality texture. Given an exemplary\ntexture, TGHop first crops many sample patches out of it to form a collection\nof sample patches called the source. Then, it analyzes pixel statistics of\nsamples from the source and obtains a sequence of fine-to-coarse subspaces for\nthese patches by using the PixelHop++ framework. To generate texture patches\nwith TGHop, we begin with the coarsest subspace, which is called the core, and\nattempt to generate samples in each subspace by following the distribution of\nreal samples. Finally, texture patches are stitched to form texture images of a\nlarge size. It is demonstrated by experimental results that TGHop can generate\ntexture images of superior quality with a small model size and at a fast speed.",

    "abstract": "The world is heading towards a state in which Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nbased agents make most decisions on behalf of humans. From healthcare decision\nmaking to social media censoring, these agents face problems and make decisions\nthat have ethical and societal implications. Hence, ethical behaviour is a\ncritical characteristic of a human-centric AI. A common observation in\nhuman-centric industries, like the service industry and healthcare, is that\ntheir professionals tend to break rules, if necessary, for pro-social reasons.\nTo make AI agents more human-centric, we argue that there is a need for a\nmechanism that helps AI agents to identify when and how to break rules set by\ntheir designers. In this paper, we examine the when, i.e., conditions under\nwhich humans break rules for pro-social reasons. In the presented study, we\nintroduce a 'vaccination strategy dilemma' where one needs to decide whether\nthey would distribute Covid-19 vaccines only to members of a high-risk group\n(follow the rule) or, in selected cases, administer the vaccine to a few social\ninfluencers (break the rule), which might yield an overall greater benefit to\nsociety. Results of the empirical study suggest a relationship between\nstakeholder utilities and pro-social rule breaking (PSRB), which either\ndeontological or utilitarian ethics cannot completely explain. Finally, the\npaper discusses the design characteristics of an ethical agent capable of PSRB\nand the future research directions on PSRB in the AI realm.",

    "abstract": "The prediction of surrounding traffic participants behavior is a crucial and\nchallenging task for driver assistance and autonomous driving systems. Today's\napproaches mainly focus on modeling dynamic aspects of the traffic situation\nand try to predict traffic participants behavior based on this. In this article\nwe take a first step towards extending this common practice by calculating\nlocation-specific a-priori lane change probabilities. The idea behind this is\nstraight forward: The driving behavior of humans may vary in exactly the same\ntraffic situation depending on the respective location. E.g. drivers may ask\nthemselves: Should I pass the truck in front of me immediately or should I wait\nuntil reaching the less curvy part of my route lying only a few kilometers\nahead? Although, such information is far away from allowing behavior prediction\non its own, it is obvious that today's approaches will greatly benefit when\nincorporating such location-specific a-priori probabilities into their\npredictions. For example, our investigations show that highway interchanges\ntend to enhance driver's motivation to perform lane changes, whereas curves\nseem to have lane change-dampening effects. Nevertheless, the investigation of\nall considered local conditions shows that superposition of various effects can\nlead to unexpected probabilities at some locations. We thus suggest dynamically\nconstructing and maintaining a lane change probability map based on customer\nfleet data in order to support onboard prediction systems with additional\ninformation. For deriving reliable lane change probabilities a broad customer\nfleet is the key to success.",

    "abstract": "Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is quickly becoming the customary means for\nidentification of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) due to its ability to obtain\nhigh resolution information about the genes and mechanisms that are causing\nresistance and driving pathogen mobility. By contrast, traditional phenotypic\n(antibiogram) testing cannot easily elucidate such information. Yet development\nof AMR prediction tools from genotype-phenotype data can be biased, since\nsampling is non-randomized. Sample provenience, period of collection, and\nspecies representation can confound the association of genetic traits with AMR.\nThus, prediction models can perform poorly on new data with sampling\ndistribution shifts. In this work -- under an explicit set of causal\nassumptions -- we evaluate the effectiveness of propensity-based rebalancing\nand confounding adjustment on AMR prediction using genotype-phenotype AMR data\nfrom the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC). We select bacterial\ngenotypes (encoded as k-mer signatures, i.e. DNA fragments of length k),\ncountry, year, species, and AMR phenotypes for the tetracycline drug class,\npreparing test data with recent genomes coming from a single country. We test\nboosted logistic regression (BLR) and random forests (RF) with/without\nbias-handling. On 10,936 instances, we find evidence of species, location and\nyear imbalance with respect to the AMR phenotype. The crude versus\nbias-adjusted change in effect of genetic signatures on AMR varies but only\nmoderately (selecting the top 20,000 out of 40+ million k-mers). The area under\nthe receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of the RF (0.95) is comparable to\nthat of BLR (0.94) on both out-of-bag samples from bootstrap and the external\ntest (n=1,085), where AUROCs do not decrease. We observe a 1%-5% gain in AUROC\nwith bias-handling compared to the sole use of genetic signatures. ...",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate, both analytically and numerically, that learning dynamics of\nneural networks is generically attracted towards a self-organized critical\nstate. The effect can be modeled with quartic interactions between\nnon-trainable variables (e.g. states of neurons) and trainable variables (e.g.\nweight matrix). Non-trainable variables are rapidly driven towards stochastic\nequilibrium and trainable variables are slowly driven towards learning\nequilibrium described by a scale-invariant distribution on a wide range of\nscales. Our results suggest that the scale invariance observed in many physical\nand biological systems might be due to some kind of learning dynamics and\nsupport the claim that the universe might be a neural network.",

    "title": "Modality Completion via Gaussian Process Prior Variational Autoencoders  for Multi-Modal Glioma Segmentation",
    "abstract": "In large studies involving multi protocol Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),\nit can occur to miss one or more sub-modalities for a given patient owing to\npoor quality (e.g. imaging artifacts), failed acquisitions, or hallway\ninterrupted imaging examinations. In some cases, certain protocols are\nunavailable due to limited scan time or to retrospectively harmonise the\nimaging protocols of two independent studies. Missing image modalities pose a\nchallenge to segmentation frameworks as complementary information contributed\nby the missing scans is then lost. In this paper, we propose a novel model,\nMulti-modal Gaussian Process Prior Variational Autoencoder (MGP-VAE), to impute\none or more missing sub-modalities for a patient scan. MGP-VAE can leverage the\nGaussian Process (GP) prior on the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to utilize the\nsubjects/patients and sub-modalities correlations. Instead of designing one\nnetwork for each possible subset of present sub-modalities or using frameworks\nto mix feature maps, missing data can be generated from a single model based on\nall the available samples. We show the applicability of MGP-VAE on brain tumor\nsegmentation where either, two, or three of four sub-modalities may be missing.\nOur experiments against competitive segmentation baselines with missing\nsub-modality on BraTS'19 dataset indicate the effectiveness of the MGP-VAE\nmodel for segmentation tasks.",

We propose a successive\nrefinement based algorithm called Adaptive Contextual Bandit ({\\ttfamily ACB}),\nthat works in phases and successively eliminates model classes that are too\nsimple to fit the given instance. We prove that this algorithm is adaptive,\ni.e., the regret rate order-wise matches that of {\\ttfamily FALCON}, the\nstate-of-art contextual bandit algorithm of Levi et. al '20, that needs\nknowledge of the true model class. The price of not knowing the correct model\nclass is only an additive term contributing to the second order term in the\nregret bound. This cost possess the intuitive property that it becomes smaller\nas the model class becomes easier to identify, and vice-versa. We then show\nthat a much simpler explore-then-commit (ETC) style algorithm also obtains a\nregret rate of matching that of {\\ttfamily FALCON}, despite not knowing the\ntrue model class. However, the cost of model selection is higher in ETC as\nopposed to in {\\ttfamily ACB}, as expected.

In the envisioned system, IoT devices are\nconnected with the centralized cloud server (CS) via multiple fog access points\n(F-APs). We consider two different scenarios for training the local models. In\nthe first scenario, local models are trained at the IoT devices and the F-APs\nupload the local model parameters to the CS. In the second scenario, local\nmodels are trained at the F-APs based on the collected data from the IoT\ndevices and the F-APs collaborate with the CS for updating the model\nparameters. Our objective is to minimize the overall energy-consumption of both\nscenarios subject to FL time constraint. Towards this goal, we devise a joint\noptimization of scheduling of IoT devices with the F-APs, transmit power\nallocation, computation frequency allocation at the devices and F-APs and\ndecouple it into two subproblems. In the first subproblem, we optimize the IoT\ndevice scheduling and power allocation, while in the second subproblem, we\noptimize the computation frequency allocation. For each scenario, we develop a\nconflict graph based solution to iteratively solve the two subproblems.\nSimulation results show that the proposed two schemes achieve a considerable\nperformance gain in terms of the energy consumption minimization.

    "abstract": "Modern Internet of Things solutions are used in a variety of different areas,\nranging from connected vehicles and healthcare to industrial applications. They\nrely on a large amount of interconnected sensors, which can lead to both\ntechnical and economical challenges. Virtual sensing techniques aim to reduce\nthe number of physical sensors in a system by using data from available\nmeasurements to estimate additional unknown quantities of interest. Successful\nmodel-based solutions include Kalman filters or the combination of finite\nelement models and modal analysis, while many data-driven methods rely on\nmachine learning algorithms. The presented hybrid virtual sensing approach\ncombines Long Short-Term Memory networks with frequency response function\nmodels in order to estimate the behavior of non-linear dynamic systems with\nmultiple input and output channels. Network training and prediction make use of\nshort signal subsequences, which are later recombined by applying a windowing\ntechnique. The frequency response function model acts as a baseline estimate\nwhich perfectly captures linear dynamic systems and is augmented by the\nnon-linear Long Short-Term Memory network following two different hybrid\nmodeling strategies. The approach is tested using a non-linear experimental\ndataset, which results from measurements of a three-component servo-hydraulic\nfatigue test bench. A variety of metrics in time and frequency domains, as well\nas fatigue strength under variable amplitudes are used to evaluate the\napproximation quality of the proposed method.

We propose a StarGAN-based\nframework to learn a many-to-many mapping across different speakers, that takes\ninto account speaker-dependent emotional style without the need for parallel\ndata. To achieve this, we condition the generator on emotional style encoding\nderived from a pre-trained speech emotion recognition(SER) model. The\nexperiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in both\nobjective and subjective evaluations. To our best knowledge, this is the first\nstudy on expressive voice conversion.",

    "abstract": "Science advances by pushing the boundaries of the adjacent possible. While\nthe global scientific enterprise grows at an exponential pace, at the\nmesoscopic level the exploration and exploitation of research ideas is\nreflected through the rise and fall of research fields. The empirical\nliterature has largely studied such dynamics on a case-by-case basis, with a\nfocus on explaining how and why communities of knowledge production evolve.\nAlthough fields rise and fall on different temporal and population scales, they\nare generally argued to pass through a common set of evolutionary stages.To\nunderstand the social processes that drive these stages beyond case studies, we\nneed a way to quantify and compare different fields on the same terms. In this\npaper we develop techniques for identifying scale-invariant patterns in the\nevolution of scientific fields, and demonstrate their usefulness using 1.5\nmillion preprints from the arXiv repository covering $175$ research fields\nspanning Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Quantitative Biology and\nQuantitative Finance. We show that fields consistently follows a rise and fall\npattern captured by a two parameters right-tailed Gumbel temporal distribution.\nWe introduce a field-specific rescaled time and explore the generic properties\nshared by articles and authors at the creation, adoption, peak, and decay\nevolutionary phases. We find that the early phase of a field is characterized\nby the mixing of cognitively distant fields by small teams of interdisciplinary\nauthors, while late phases exhibit the role of specialized, large teams\nbuilding on the previous works in the field. This method provides foundations\nto quantitatively explore the generic patterns underlying the evolution of\nresearch fields in science, with general implications in innovation studies.",

    "abstract": "The declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic has largely amplified the spread of\nrelated information on social media, such as Twitter, Facebook, and\nWeChat.Unlike the previous studies which focused on how to detect the\nmisinformation or fake news related toCOVID-19, we investigate how the disease\nand information co-evolve in the population. We focus onCOVID-19and its\ninformation during the period when the disease was widely spread in China,\ni.e., from January 25th to March 24th, 2020. We first explore how the disease\nand information co-evolve via the spatial analysis of the two spreading\nprocesses. We visualize the geo-location of both disease and information at the\nprovince level and find that disease is more geo-localized compared to\ninformation. We find a high correlation between the disease and information\ndata, and also people care about the spread only when it comes to their\nneighborhood. Regard to the content of the information, we find that positive\nmessages are more negatively correlated with the disease compared to negative\nand neutral messages. Additionally, we introduce machine learning algorithms,\ni.e., linear regression and random forest, to further predict the number of\ninfected using different disease spatial related and information-related\ncharacteristics. We obtain that the disease spatial related characteristics of\nnearby cities can help to improve the prediction accuracy. Meanwhile,\ninformation-related characteristics can also help to improve the prediction\nperformance, but with a delay, i.e., the improvement comes from using, for\ninstance, the number of messages 10 days ago, for disease prediction.

The current work shows how an\nanalysis using geometric algebra provides a picture complementary to that of\nthe classic matrix Lie algebra approach, while retaining information about the\nnumber of reflections in a given transformation. This imposes a graded\nstructure on Lie groups, which is not evident in their matrix representation.\nBy embracing this graded structure, the invariant decomposition theorem was\nproven: any composition of $k$ linearly independent reflections can be\ndecomposed into $\\lceil k/2 \\rceil$ commuting factors, each of which is the\nproduct of at most two reflections. This generalizes a conjecture by M. Riesz,\nand has e.g. the Mozzi-Chasles' theorem as its 3D Euclidean special case. To\ndemonstrate its utility, we briefly discuss various examples such as Lorentz\ntransformations, Wigner rotations, and screw transformations. The invariant\ndecomposition also directly leads to closed form formulas for the exponential\nand logarithmic function for all Spin groups, and identifies element of\ngeometry such as planes, lines, points, as the invariants of $k$-reflections.\nWe conclude by presenting novel matrix/vector representations for geometric\nalgebras $\\mathbb{R}_{pqr}$, and use this in E(3) to illustrate the\nrelationship with the classic covariant, contravariant and adjoint\nrepresentations for the transformation of points, planes and lines.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have increased the accuracy of automatic segmentation,\nhowever, their accuracy depends on the availability of a large number of fully\nsegmented images. Methods to train deep neural networks using images for which\nsome, but not all, regions of interest are segmented are necessary to make\nbetter use of partially annotated datasets. In this paper, we propose the first\naxiomatic definition of label-set loss functions that are the loss functions\nthat can handle partially segmented images. We prove that there is one and only\none method to convert a classical loss function for fully segmented images into\na proper label-set loss function. Our theory also allows us to define the\nleaf-Dice loss, a label-set generalization of the Dice loss particularly suited\nfor partial supervision with only missing labels. Using the leaf-Dice loss, we\nset a new state of the art in partially supervised learning for fetal brain 3D\nMRI segmentation. We achieve a deep neural network able to segment white\nmatter, ventricles, cerebellum, extra-ventricular CSF, cortical gray matter,\ndeep gray matter, brainstem, and corpus callosum based on fetal brain 3D MRI of\nanatomically normal fetuses or with open spina bifida.

While\noptimization on low-rank matrices has been extensively studied, existing\nalgorithms do not provide such a basic guarantee. We trace this back to a\ngeometric obstacle: On a nonsmooth set, there may be sequences of points along\nwhich standard measures of stationarity tend to zero, but whose limit point is\nnot stationary. We name such events apocalypses, as they can cause optimization\nalgorithms to converge to non-stationary points. We illustrate this on an\nexisting algorithm using an explicit apocalypse on the bounded-rank matrix\nvariety. To provably find stationary points, we modify a trust-region method on\na standard smooth parameterization of the variety. The method relies on the\nknown fact that second-order stationary points on the parameter space map to\nstationary points on the variety. Our geometric observations and proposed\nalgorithm generalize beyond bounded-rank matrices. We give a geometric\ncharacterization of apocalypses on general constraint sets, which implies that\nClarke-regular sets do not admit apocalypses.

    "abstract": "In cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, a 3D high-resolution\nsegmentation of the heart is essential for detailed description of its\nanatomical structures. However, due to the limit of acquisition duration and\nrespiratory/cardiac motion, stacks of multi-slice 2D images are acquired in\nclinical routine. The segmentation of these images provides a low-resolution\nrepresentation of cardiac anatomy, which may contain artefacts caused by\nmotion. Here we propose a novel latent optimisation framework that jointly\nperforms motion correction and super resolution for cardiac image\nsegmentations. Given a low-resolution segmentation as input, the framework\naccounts for inter-slice motion in cardiac MR imaging and super-resolves the\ninput into a high-resolution segmentation consistent with input. A multi-view\nloss is incorporated to leverage information from both short-axis view and\nlong-axis view of cardiac imaging. To solve the inverse problem, iterative\noptimisation is performed in a latent space, which ensures the anatomical\nplausibility. This alleviates the need of paired low-resolution and\nhigh-resolution images for supervised learning. Experiments on two cardiac MR\ndatasets show that the proposed framework achieves high performance, comparable\nto state-of-the-art super-resolution approaches and with better cross-domain\ngeneralisability and anatomical plausibility.",

    "title": "Locally differentially private estimation of nonlinear functionals of  discrete distributions",
    "abstract": "We study the problem of estimating non-linear functionals of discrete\ndistributions in the context of local differential privacy. The initial data\n$x_1,\\ldots,x_n \\in [K]$ are supposed i.i.d. and distributed according to an\nunknown discrete distribution $p = (p_1,\\ldots,p_K)$. Only $\\alpha$-locally\ndifferentially private (LDP) samples $z_1,...,z_n$ are publicly available,\nwhere the term 'local' means that each $z_i$ is produced using one individual\nattribute $x_i$. We exhibit privacy mechanisms (PM) that are interactive (i.e.\nthey are allowed to use already published confidential data) or\nnon-interactive. We describe the behavior of the quadratic risk for estimating\nthe power sum functional $F_{\\gamma} = \\sum_{k=1}^K p_k^{\\gamma}$, $\\gamma >0$\nas a function of $K, \\, n$ and $\\alpha$. In the non-interactive case, we study\ntwo plug-in type estimators of $F_{\\gamma}$, for all $\\gamma >0$, that are\nsimilar to the MLE analyzed by Jiao et al. (2017) in the multinomial model.\nHowever, due to the privacy constraint the rates we attain are slower and\nsimilar to those obtained in the Gaussian model by Collier et al. (2020). In\nthe interactive case, we introduce for all $\\gamma >1$ a two-step procedure\nwhich attains the faster parametric rate $(n \\alpha^2)^{-1/2}$ when $\\gamma\n\\geq 2$. We give lower bounds results over all $\\alpha$-LDP mechanisms and all\nestimators using the private samples.",

In this study, we consider general quantum channel\ndiscrimination problems, and derive the lower bounds of the error probability.\nOur lower bounds are based on the triangle inequalities of the Bures angle and\nthe trace distance. As a consequence of the lower bound based on the Bures\nangle, we prove the optimality of Grover's search if the number of marked\nelements is fixed to some integer $k$. This result generalizes Zalka's result\nfor $k=1$. We also present several numerical results in which our lower bounds\nbased on the trace distance outperform recently obtained lower bounds.",

    "title": "On recovering the second-order convergence of the lattice Boltzmann  method with reaction-type source terms",
    "abstract": "This study derives a method to consistently recover the second-order\nconvergence of the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), which is frequently degraded\nby the improper discretisation of required source terms. The work focuses on\nadvection-diffusion models in which the source terms are dependent on the\nintensity of transported fields. The main findings are applicable to a wide\nrange of formulations within the LBM framework. All considered source terms are\ninterpreted as contributions to the zeroth-moment of the distribution function.\nThese account for sources in a scalar field, such as density, concentration or\ntemperature. In addition to this, certain immersed boundary methods can be\ninterpreted as a source term in their formulation, highlighting a further\napplication for this work.\nThis paper makes three primary contributions to the current state-of-the-art.\nFirstly, it identifies the differences observed between the ways source terms\nare included in the LBM schemes present in the literature. The algebraic\nmanipulations are explicitly presented in this paper to clarify the differences\nobserved, and identify their origin. Secondly, it derives in full detail, the\nimplicit relation between the value of the transported macroscopic field, and\nthe sum of the LBM densities. Moreover, this relation is valid for any source\nterm discretization scheme, and three equivalent forms of the second-order\naccurate collision operator are presented. Finally, closed-form solutions of\nthis implicit relation are shown for a variety of common models.\nThe second-order convergence of the proposed LBM schemes is verified on both\nlinear and non-linear source terms. Commonly used diffusive and acoustic\nscalings are discussed, and their pitfalls are identified. Moreover, for a\nsimplified case, the competing errors are shown visually with isolines of error\nin the space of spatial and temporal resolutions.",

    "abstract": "Automatic classification of disordered speech can provide an objective tool\nfor identifying the presence and severity of speech impairment. Classification\napproaches can also help identify hard-to-recognize speech samples to teach ASR\nsystems about the variable manifestations of impaired speech. Here, we develop\nand compare different deep learning techniques to classify the intelligibility\nof disordered speech on selected phrases. We collected samples from a diverse\nset of 661 speakers with a variety of self-reported disorders speaking 29 words\nor phrases, which were rated by speech-language pathologists for their overall\nintelligibility using a five-point Likert scale. We then evaluated classifiers\ndeveloped using 3 approaches: (1) a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained\nfor the task, (2) classifiers trained on non-semantic speech representations\nfrom CNNs that used an unsupervised objective [1], and (3) classifiers trained\non the acoustic (encoder) embeddings from an ASR system trained on typical\nspeech [2]. We found that the ASR encoder's embeddings considerably outperform\nthe other two on detecting and classifying disordered speech. Further analysis\nshows that the ASR embeddings cluster speech by the spoken phrase, while the\nnon-semantic embeddings cluster speech by speaker. Also, longer phrases are\nmore indicative of intelligibility deficits than single words.",

    "title": "Atlas-Based Segmentation of Intracochlear Anatomy in Metal Artifact  Affected CT Images of the Ear with Co-trained Deep Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "We propose an atlas-based method to segment the intracochlear anatomy (ICA)\nin the post-implantation CT (Post-CT) images of cochlear implant (CI)\nrecipients that preserves the point-to-point correspondence between the meshes\nin the atlas and the segmented volumes. To solve this problem, which is\nchallenging because of the strong artifacts produced by the implant, we use a\npair of co-trained deep networks that generate dense deformation fields (DDFs)\nin opposite directions. One network is tasked with registering an atlas image\nto the Post-CT images and the other network is tasked with registering the\nPost-CT images to the atlas image. The networks are trained using loss\nfunctions based on voxel-wise labels, image content, fiducial registration\nerror, and cycle-consistency constraint. The segmentation of the ICA in the\nPost-CT images is subsequently obtained by transferring the predefined\nsegmentation meshes of the ICA in the atlas image to the Post-CT images using\nthe corresponding DDFs generated by the trained registration networks. Our\nmodel can learn the underlying geometric features of the ICA even though they\nare obscured by the metal artifacts. We show that our end-to-end network\nproduces results that are comparable to the current state of the art (SOTA)\nthat relies on a two-steps approach that first uses conditional generative\nadversarial networks to synthesize artifact-free images from the Post-CT images\nand then uses an active shape model-based method to segment the ICA in the\nsynthetic images. Our method requires a fraction of the time needed by the\nSOTA, which is important for end-user acceptance.",
