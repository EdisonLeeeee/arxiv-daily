    "title": "Social Processes: Self-Supervised Forecasting of Nonverbal Cues in  Social Conversations",
    "abstract": "The default paradigm for the forecasting of human behavior in social\nconversations is characterized by top-down approaches. These involve\nidentifying predictive relationships between low level nonverbal cues and\nfuture semantic events of interest (e.g. turn changes, group leaving). A common\nhurdle however, is the limited availability of labeled data for supervised\nlearning. In this work, we take the first step in the direction of a bottom-up\nself-supervised approach in the domain. We formulate the task of Social Cue\nForecasting to leverage the larger amount of unlabeled low-level behavior cues,\nand characterize the modeling challenges involved. To address these, we take a\nmeta-learning approach and propose the Social Process (SP) models--socially\naware sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models within the Neural Process (NP)\nfamily. SP models learn extractable representations of non-semantic future cues\nfor each participant, while capturing global uncertainty by jointly reasoning\nabout the future for all members of the group. Evaluation on synthesized and\nreal-world behavior data shows that our SP models achieve higher log-likelihood\nthan the NP baselines, and also highlights important considerations for\napplying such techniques within the domain of social human interactions.",

    "title": "Pre-train, Prompt, and Predict: A Systematic Survey of Prompting Methods  in Natural Language Processing",
    "abstract": "This paper surveys and organizes research works in a new paradigm in natural\nlanguage processing, which we dub \"prompt-based learning\". Unlike traditional\nsupervised learning, which trains a model to take in an input x and predict an\noutput y as P(y|x), prompt-based learning is based on language models that\nmodel the probability of text directly. To use these models to perform\nprediction tasks, the original input x is modified using a template into a\ntextual string prompt x' that has some unfilled slots, and then the language\nmodel is used to probabilistically fill the unfilled information to obtain a\nfinal string x, from which the final output y can be derived. This framework is\npowerful and attractive for a number of reasons: it allows the language model\nto be pre-trained on massive amounts of raw text, and by defining a new\nprompting function the model is able to perform few-shot or even zero-shot\nlearning, adapting to new scenarios with few or no labeled data. In this paper\nwe introduce the basics of this promising paradigm, describe a unified set of\nmathematical notations that can cover a wide variety of existing work, and\norganize existing work along several dimensions, e.g.the choice of pre-trained\nmodels, prompts, and tuning strategies. To make the field more accessible to\ninterested beginners, we not only make a systematic review of existing works\nand a highly structured typology of prompt-based concepts, but also release\nother resources, e.g., a website this http URL including\nconstantly-updated survey, and paperlist.",

    "title": "Fast and Scalable Image Search For Histology",
    "abstract": "The expanding adoption of digital pathology has enabled the curation of large\nrepositories of histology whole slide images (WSIs), which contain a wealth of\ninformation. Similar pathology image search offers the opportunity to comb\nthrough large historical repositories of gigapixel WSIs to identify cases with\nsimilar morphological features and can be particularly useful for diagnosing\nrare diseases, identifying similar cases for predicting prognosis, treatment\noutcomes, and potential clinical trial success. A critical challenge in\ndeveloping a WSI search and retrieval system is scalability, which is uniquely\nchallenging given the need to search a growing number of slides that each can\nconsist of billions of pixels and are several gigabytes in size. Such systems\nare typically slow and retrieval speed often scales with the size of the\nrepository they search through, making their clinical adoption tedious and are\nnot feasible for repositories that are constantly growing. Here we present Fast\nImage Search for Histopathology (FISH), a histology image search pipeline that\nis infinitely scalable and achieves constant search speed that is independent\nof the image database size while being interpretable and without requiring\ndetailed annotations. FISH uses self-supervised deep learning to encode\nmeaningful representations from WSIs and a Van Emde Boas tree for fast search,\nfollowed by an uncertainty-based ranking algorithm to retrieve similar WSIs. We\nevaluated FISH on multiple tasks and datasets with over 22,000 patient cases\nspanning 56 disease subtypes. We additionally demonstrate that FISH can be used\nto assist with the diagnosis of rare cancer types where sufficient cases may\nnot be available to train traditional supervised deep models. FISH is available\nas an easy-to-use, open-source software package\n(https://github.com/mahmoodlab/FISH).",

    "abstract": "Deep Learning applications are becoming increasingly popular. Developers of\ndeep learning systems strive to write more efficient code. Deep learning\nsystems are constantly evolving, imposing tighter development timelines and\nincreasing complexity, which may lead to bad design decisions. A copy-paste\napproach is widely used among deep learning developers because they rely on\ncommon frameworks and duplicate similar tasks. Developers often fail to\nproperly propagate changes to all clones fragments during a maintenance\nactivity. To our knowledge, no study has examined code cloning practices in\ndeep learning development. Given the negative impacts of clones on software\nquality reported in the studies on traditional systems, it is very important to\nunderstand the characteristics and potential impacts of code clones on deep\nlearning systems. To this end, we use the NiCad tool to detect clones from 59\nPython, 14 C# and 6 Java-based deep learning systems and an equal number of\ntraditional software systems. We then analyze the frequency and distribution of\ncode clones in deep learning and traditional systems. We do further analysis of\nthe distribution of code clones using location-based taxonomy. We also study\nthe correlation between bugs and code clones to assess the impacts of clones on\nthe quality of the studied systems. Finally, we introduce a code clone taxonomy\nrelated to deep learning programs and identify the deep learning system\ndevelopment phases in which cloning has the highest risk of faults. Our results\nshow that code cloning is a frequent practice in deep learning systems and that\ndeep learning developers often clone code from files in distant repositories in\nthe system. In addition, we found that code cloning occurs more frequently\nduring DL model construction.

An important and still largely unexplored\ntask in this characterization is determining major factors within the real\nworld that affect the AI's behavior, such as weather conditions or lighting,\nand either a) being able to give justification for why it may have failed or b)\neliminating the influence the factor has. Determining these sensitive factors\nheavily relies on collected data that is diverse enough to cover numerous\ncombinations of these factors, which becomes more onerous when having many\npotential sensitive factors or operating in complex environments. This paper\ninvestigates methods that discover and separate out individual semantic\nsensitive factors from a given dataset to conduct this characterization as well\nas addressing mitigation of these factors' sensitivity. We also broaden\nremediation of fairness, which normally only addresses socially relevant\nfactors, and widen it to deal with the desensitization of AI with regard to all\npossible aspects of variation in the domain. The proposed methods which\ndiscover these major factors reduce the potentially onerous demands of\ncollecting a sufficiently diverse dataset.

    "title": "Beyond SDLC: Process Modeling and Documentation Using Thinging Machines",
    "abstract": "The software development life cycle (SDLC) is a procedure used to develop a\nsoftware system that meets both the customer s needs and real-world\nrequirements. The first phase of the SDLC involves creating a conceptual model\nthat represents the involved domain in reality. In requirements engineering,\nbuilding such a model is considered a bridge to the design and construction\nphases. However, this type of model can also serve as a basic model for\nidentifying business processes and how these processes are interconnected to\nachieve the final result. This paper focuses on process modeling in\norganizations, per se, beyond its application in the SDLC when an organization\nneeds further documentation to meet its growth needs and address regular\nchanges over time. The resultant process documentation is created alongside the\ndaily operations of the business process. The model provides process\nvisualization and documentation to assist in defining work patterns, avoiding\nredundancy, or even designing new processes. In this paper, a proposed\ndiagrammatic representation models each process using one diagram comprising\nfive actions and two types of relationships to build three levels of depiction.\nThese levels consist of a static description, events, and the behavior of the\nmodeled process. The viability of a thinging machine is demonstrated by\nre-modeling some examples from the literature.",

This study focuses on exploring a reverse search functionality where\na user can sign a query sign in front of a webcam and retrieve a set of\nmatching signs. By extracting different body joints combinations (upper body,\ndominant hand's arm and wrist) using the pose estimation framework OpenPose, we\ncompare four techniques (PCA, UMAP, DTW and Euclidean distance) as distance\nmetrics between 20 query signs, each performed by eight participants on a 1200\nsign lexicon. The results show that UMAP and DTW can predict a matching sign\nwith an 80\\% and 71\\% accuracy respectively at the top-20 retrieved signs using\nthe movement of the dominant hand arm. Using DTW and adding more sign instances\nfrom other participants in the lexicon, the accuracy can be raised to 90\\% at\nthe top-10 ranking.

    "abstract": "Adversarial training has been empirically proven to be one of the most\neffective and reliable defense methods against adversarial attacks. However,\nalmost all existing studies about adversarial training are focused on balanced\ndatasets, where each class has an equal amount of training examples. Research\non adversarial training with imbalanced training datasets is rather limited. As\nthe initial effort to investigate this problem, we reveal the facts that\nadversarially trained models present two distinguished behaviors from naturally\ntrained models in imbalanced datasets: (1) Compared to natural training,\nadversarially trained models can suffer much worse performance on\nunder-represented classes, when the training dataset is extremely imbalanced.\n(2) Traditional reweighting strategies may lose efficacy to deal with the\nimbalance issue for adversarial training. For example, upweighting the\nunder-represented classes will drastically hurt the model's performance on\nwell-represented classes, and as a result, finding an optimal reweighting value\ncan be tremendously challenging. In this paper, to further understand our\nobservations, we theoretically show that the poor data separability is one key\nreason causing this strong tension between under-represented and\nwell-represented classes. Motivated by this finding, we propose Separable\nReweighted Adversarial Training (SRAT) to facilitate adversarial training under\nimbalanced scenarios, by learning more separable features for different\nclasses.

To this aim, we devise an upper bounding\ntechnique based on the solution of a classical (and simpler) time-independent\nAsymmetric Travelling Salesman Problem, where the constant arc costs are\nsuitably defined by the combined use of a Linear Program and a mix of\nunsupervised and supervised Machine Learning techniques.

HPE aims to correctly identify the main joint locations of a single\nperson or multiple people in a given image or video. Locating joints of a\nperson in images or videos is an important task that can be applied in action\nrecognition and object tracking. As have many computer vision tasks, HPE has\nadvanced massively with the introduction of deep learning to the field. In this\npaper, we focus on one of the deep learning-based approaches of HPE proposed by\nNewell et al., which they named the stacked hourglass network. Their approach\nis widely used in many applications and is regarded as one of the best works in\nthis area. The main focus of their approach is to capture as much information\nas it can at all possible scales so that a coherent understanding of the local\nfeatures and full-body location is achieved. Their findings demonstrate that\nimportant cues such as orientation of a person, arrangement of limbs, and\nadjacent joints' relative location can be identified from multiple scales at\ndifferent resolutions. To do so, they makes use of a single pipeline to process\nimages in multiple resolutions, which comprises a skip layer to not lose\nspatial information at each resolution.

    "abstract": "The dominant paradigm in spatiotemporal action detection is to classify\nactions using spatiotemporal features learned by 2D or 3D Convolutional\nNetworks. We argue that several actions are characterized by their context,\nsuch as relevant objects and actors present in the video. To this end, we\nintroduce an architecture based on self-attention and Graph Convolutional\nNetworks in order to model contextual cues, such as actor-actor and\nactor-object interactions, to improve human action detection in video. We are\ninterested in achieving this in a weakly-supervised setting, i.e. using as less\nannotations as possible in terms of action bounding boxes. Our model aids\nexplainability by visualizing the learned context as an attention map, even for\nactions and objects unseen during training. We evaluate how well our model\nhighlights the relevant context by introducing a quantitative metric based on\nrecall of objects retrieved by attention maps. Our model relies on a 3D\nconvolutional RGB stream, and does not require expensive optical flow\ncomputation. We evaluate our models on the DALY dataset, which consists of\nhuman-object interaction actions.

    "abstract": "It is generally observed that the fraction of live lines in shared last-level\ncaches (SLLC) is very small for chip multiprocessors (CMPs). This can be\ntackled using promotion-based replacement policies like re-reference interval\nprediction (RRIP) instead of LRU, dead-block predictors, or reuse-based cache\nallocation schemes. In GPU systems, similar LLC issues are alleviated using\nvarious cache bypassing techniques. These issues are worsened in heterogeneous\nCPU-GPU systems because the two processors have different data access patterns\nand frequencies. GPUs generally work on streaming data, but have many more\nthreads accessing memory as compared to CPUs. As such, most traditional cache\nreplacement and allocation policies prove ineffective due to the higher number\nof cache accesses in GPU applications, resulting in higher allocation for GPU\ncache lines, despite their minimal reuse. In this work, we implement the Reuse\nCache approach for heterogeneous CPU-GPU systems. The reuse cache is a\ndecoupled tag/data SLLC which is designed to only store the data that is being\naccessed more than once. This design is based on the observation that most of\nthe cache lines in the LLC are stored but do not get reused before being\nreplaced. We find that the reuse cache achieves within 0.5% of the IPC gains of\na statically partitioned LLC, while decreasing the area cost of the LLC by an\naverage of 40%.",

    "title": "Learning User-Interpretable Descriptions of Black-Box AI System  Capabilities",
    "abstract": "Several approaches have been developed to answer specific questions that a\nuser may have about an AI system that can plan and act. However, the problems\nof identifying which questions to ask and that of computing a\nuser-interpretable symbolic description of the overall capabilities of the\nsystem have remained largely unaddressed. This paper presents an approach for\naddressing these problems by learning user-interpretable symbolic descriptions\nof the limits and capabilities of a black-box AI system using low-level\nsimulators. It uses a hierarchical active querying paradigm to generate\nquestions and to learn a user-interpretable model of the AI system based on its\nresponses. In contrast to prior work, we consider settings where imprecision of\nthe user's conceptual vocabulary precludes a direct expression of the agent's\ncapabilities. Furthermore, our approach does not require assumptions about the\ninternal design of the target AI system or about the methods that it may use to\ncompute or learn task solutions. Empirical evaluation on several game-based\nsimulator domains shows that this approach can efficiently learn symbolic\nmodels of AI systems that use a deterministic black-box policy in fully\nobservable scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal sentiment analysis aims to extract and integrate semantic\ninformation collected from multiple modalities to recognize the expressed\nemotions and sentiment in multimodal data. This research area's major concern\nlies in developing an extraordinary fusion scheme that can extract and\nintegrate key information from various modalities. However, one issue that may\nrestrict previous work to achieve a higher level is the lack of proper modeling\nfor the dynamics of the competition between the independence and relevance\namong modalities, which could deteriorate fusion outcomes by causing the\ncollapse of modality-specific feature space or introducing extra noise. To\nmitigate this, we propose the Bi-Bimodal Fusion Network (BBFN), a novel\nend-to-end network that performs fusion (relevance increment) and separation\n(difference increment) on pairwise modality representations. The two parts are\ntrained simultaneously such that the combat between them is simulated. The\nmodel takes two bimodal pairs as input due to the known information imbalance\namong modalities. In addition, we leverage a gated control mechanism in the\nTransformer architecture to further improve the final output. Experimental\nresults on three datasets (CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and UR-FUNNY) verifies that our\nmodel significantly outperforms the SOTA.

Further, advances in synthetic\nbiology herald the time when we'll be able to rationally engineer complex\nchemical systems, and when idealized formal models will become blueprints for\nengineering. Coupled chemical interactions in a well-mixed solution are\ncommonly formalized as chemical reaction networks (CRNs). However, despite the\nwidespread use of CRNs in the natural sciences, the range of computational\nbehaviors exhibited by CRNs is not well understood. Here we study the following\nproblem: what functions $f:\\mathbb{R}^k \\to \\mathbb{R}$ can be computed by a\nCRN, in which the CRN eventually produces the correct amount of the \"output\"\nmolecule, no matter the rate at which reactions proceed? This captures a\npreviously unexplored, but very natural class of computations: for example, the\nreaction $X_1 + X_2 \\to Y$ can be thought to compute the function $y =\n\\min(x_1, x_2)$. Such a CRN is robust in the sense that it is correct whether\nits evolution is governed by the standard model of mass-action kinetics,\nalternatives such as Hill-function or Michaelis-Menten kinetics, or other\narbitrary models of chemistry that respect the (fundamentally digital)\nstoichiometric constraints (what are the reactants and products?).

Many existing methods\non efficient network have already taken feature fusion into consideration,\nwhich largely boosts the performance. However, its performance is far inferior\nto large network such as ResNet and HRNet due to its limited fusion operation\nin the network. Specifically, we expand the number of fusion operation by\nbuilding bridges between two pyramid frameworks without adding layers.\nMeanwhile, to capture long-range dependency, we propose a lightweight attention\nblock -- HSA, which computes second-order attention map. In summary, SFM\nmaximizes the number of feature fusion in a limited number of layers. HSA\nlearns high precise spatial information by computing the attention of spatial\nattention map. With the help of SFM and HSA, our network is able to generate\nmulti-level feature and extract precise global spatial information with little\ncomputing resource. Thus, our method achieve comparable or even better accuracy\nwith less parameters and computational cost. Our SFM achieve 89.0 in PCKh@0.5,\n42.0 in PCKh@0.1 on MPII validation set and 71.7 in AP, 90.7 in AP@0.5 on COCO\nvalidation with only 1.7G FLOPs and 1.5M parameters.

We examine\nconsciousness from the perspective of theoretical computer science (TCS), a\nbranch of mathematics concerned with understanding the underlying principles of\ncomputation and complexity, including the implications and surprising\nconsequences of resource limitations. In the spirit of Alan Turing's simple yet\npowerful definition of a computer, the Turing Machine (TM), and perspective of\ncomputational complexity theory, we formalize a modified version of the Global\nWorkspace Theory (GWT) of consciousness originated by cognitive neuroscientist\nBernard Baars and further developed by him, Stanislas Dehaene, Jean-Pierre\nChangeaux and others. We are not looking for a complex model of the brain nor\nof cognition, but for a simple computational model of (the admittedly complex\nconcept of) consciousness. We do this by defining the Conscious Turing Machine\n(CTM), also called a conscious AI, and then we define consciousness and related\nnotions in the CTM. While these are only mathematical (TCS) definitions, we\nsuggest why the CTM has the feeling of consciousness. The TCS perspective\nprovides a simple formal framework to employ tools from computational\ncomplexity theory and machine learning to help us understand consciousness and\nrelated concepts. Previously we explored high level explanations for the\nfeelings of pain and pleasure in the CTM.

In previous work, Madsen et al. presented a precise static analysis\nfor detecting such problems, but their analysis does not scale because it may\nrequire a number of contexts that is exponential in the size of the program.\nConcentrating on the problem of detecting dead listeners, we present an\napproach to learn how to correctly use event-based APIs by first mining a large\ncorpus of JavaScript code using a simple static analysis to identify code\nsnippets that register an event listener, and then applying statistical\nmodeling to identify unusual patterns, which often indicate incorrect API\nusage.

    "title": "Maximize the Foot Clearance for a Hopping Robotic Leg ConsideringMotor  Saturation",
    "abstract": "A hopping leg, no matter in legged animals or humans, usually behaves like a\nspring during the periodic hopping. Hopping like a spring is efficient and\nwithout the requirement of complicated control algorithms. Position and force\ncontrol are two main methods to realize such a spring-like behaviour. The\nposition control usually consumes the torque resources to ensure the position\naccuracy and compensate the tracking errors. In comparison, the force control\nstrategy is able to maintain a high elasticity. Currently, the position and\nforce control both leads to the discount of motor saturation ratio as well as\nthe bandwidth of the control system, and thus attenuates the performance of the\nactuator. To augment the performance, this letter proposes a motor saturation\nstrategy based on the force control to maximize the output torque of the\nactuator and realize the continuous hopping motion with natural dynamics. The\nproposed strategy is able to maximize the saturation ratio of motor and thus\nmaximize the foot clearance of the single leg. The dynamics of the two-mass\nmodel is utilized to increase the force bandwidth and the performance of the\nactuator. A single leg with two degrees of freedom is designed as the\nexperiment platform. The actuator consists of a powerful electric motor, a\nharmonic gear and encoder. The effectiveness of this method is verified through\nsimulations and experiments using a robotic leg actuated by powerful high\nreduction ratio actuators.",

    "abstract": "Detecting abnormal activities in real-world surveillance videos is an\nimportant yet challenging task as the prior knowledge about video anomalies is\nusually limited or unavailable. Despite that many approaches have been\ndeveloped to resolve this problem, few of them can capture the normal\nspatio-temporal patterns effectively and efficiently. Moreover, existing works\nseldom explicitly consider the local consistency at frame level and global\ncoherence of temporal dynamics in video sequences. To this end, we propose\nConvolutional Transformer based Dual Discriminator Generative Adversarial\nNetworks (CT-D2GAN) to perform unsupervised video anomaly detection.\nSpecifically, we first present a convolutional transformer to perform future\nframe prediction. It contains three key components, i.e., a convolutional\nencoder to capture the spatial information of the input video clips, a temporal\nself-attention module to encode the temporal dynamics, and a convolutional\ndecoder to integrate spatio-temporal features and predict the future frame.\nNext, a dual discriminator based adversarial training procedure, which jointly\nconsiders an image discriminator that can maintain the local consistency at\nframe-level and a video discriminator that can enforce the global coherence of\ntemporal dynamics, is employed to enhance the future frame prediction. Finally,\nthe prediction error is used to identify abnormal video frames. Thoroughly\nempirical studies on three public video anomaly detection datasets, i.e., UCSD\nPed2, CUHK Avenue, and Shanghai Tech Campus, demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed adversarial spatio-temporal modeling framework.",

Inadequate\nconsideration of security in the choice of a programming language may lead to\npotential ramifications for secure development. Whilst theoretical analysis of\nthe supposed security properties of different programming languages has been\nconducted, there has been relatively little effort to empirically explore the\nactual security challenges experienced by developers. We have performed a\nlarge-scale study of the security challenges of 15 programming languages by\nquantitatively and qualitatively analysing the developers' discussions from\nStack Overflow and GitHub. By leveraging topic modelling, we have derived a\ntaxonomy of 18 major security challenges for 6 topic categories. We have also\nconducted comparative analysis to understand how the identified challenges vary\nregarding the different programming languages and data sources. Our findings\nsuggest that the challenges and their characteristics differ substantially for\ndifferent programming languages and data sources, i.e., Stack Overflow and\nGitHub. The findings provide evidence-based insights and understanding of\nsecurity challenges related to different programming languages to software\nprofessionals (i.e., practitioners or researchers). The reported taxonomy of\nsecurity challenges can assist both practitioners and researchers in better\nunderstanding and traversing the secure development landscape.

    "abstract": "In recent years, with the advent of deep-learning, face recognition has\nachieved exceptional success. However, many of these deep face recognition\nmodels perform much better in handling frontal faces compared to profile faces.\nThe major reason for poor performance in handling of profile faces is that it\nis inherently difficult to learn pose-invariant deep representations that are\nuseful for profile face recognition. In this paper, we hypothesize that the\nprofile face domain possesses a latent connection with the frontal face domain\nin a latent feature subspace. We look to exploit this latent connection by\nprojecting the profile faces and frontal faces into a common latent subspace\nand perform verification or retrieval in the latent domain. We leverage a\ncoupled conditional generative adversarial network (cpGAN) structure to find\nthe hidden relationship between the profile and frontal images in a latent\ncommon embedding subspace. Specifically, the cpGAN framework consists of two\nconditional GAN-based sub-networks, one dedicated to the frontal domain and the\nother dedicated to the profile domain. Each sub-network tends to find a\nprojection that maximizes the pair-wise correlation between the two feature\ndomains in a common embedding feature subspace. The efficacy of our approach\ncompared with the state-of-the-art is demonstrated using the CFP, CMU\nMulti-PIE, IJB-A, and IJB-C datasets. Additionally, we have also implemented a\ncoupled convolutional neural network (cpCNN) and an adversarial discriminative\ndomain adaptation network (ADDA) for profile to frontal face recognition. We\nhave evaluated the performance of cpCNN and ADDA and compared it with the\nproposed cpGAN. Finally, we have also evaluated our cpGAN for reconstruction of\nfrontal faces from input profile faces contained in the VGGFace2 dataset.",

The overall mean absolute error (MAE) for mm-fit\nwas 0.06 with off-by-one Accuracy (OBOA) 0.94. Overall MAE for UI-PRMD dataset\nwas 0.06 with OBOA 0.95. We have also tested the performance in a variety of\ncamera locations and concurrent motions with conveniently collected video with\noverall MAE 0.06 and OBOA 0.88. The proposed method provides a view-angle and\nmotion agnostic concurrent motion counting. This method can potentially use in\nlarge-scale remote rehabilitation and exercise training with only one camera.",

It estimates depth dependent on heights, which introduces\nmathematical priors into the deep model. But projection process also introduces\nthe error amplification problem, in which the error of the estimated height\nwill be amplified and reflected greatly at the output depth. This property\nleads to uncontrollable depth inferences and also damages the training\nefficiency. In this paper, we propose a Geometry Uncertainty Projection Network\n(GUP Net) to tackle the error amplification problem at both inference and\ntraining stages. Specifically, a GUP module is proposed to obtains the\ngeometry-guided uncertainty of the inferred depth, which not only provides high\nreliable confidence for each depth but also benefits depth learning.\nFurthermore, at the training stage, we propose a Hierarchical Task Learning\nstrategy to reduce the instability caused by error amplification. This learning\nalgorithm monitors the learning situation of each task by a proposed indicator\nand adaptively assigns the proper loss weights for different tasks according to\ntheir pre-tasks situation. Based on that, each task starts learning only when\nits pre-tasks are learned well, which can significantly improve the stability\nand efficiency of the training process.

    "abstract": "Multimodal deep learning systems which employ multiple modalities like text,\nimage, audio, video, etc., are showing better performance in comparison with\nindividual modalities (i.e., unimodal) systems. Multimodal machine learning\ninvolves multiple aspects: representation, translation, alignment, fusion, and\nco-learning. In the current state of multimodal machine learning, the\nassumptions are that all modalities are present, aligned, and noiseless during\ntraining and testing time. However, in real-world tasks, typically, it is\nobserved that one or more modalities are missing, noisy, lacking annotated\ndata, have unreliable labels, and are scarce in training or testing and or\nboth. This challenge is addressed by a learning paradigm called multimodal\nco-learning. The modeling of a (resource-poor) modality is aided by exploiting\nknowledge from another (resource-rich) modality using transfer of knowledge\nbetween modalities, including their representations and predictive models.\nCo-learning being an emerging area, there are no dedicated reviews explicitly\nfocusing on all challenges addressed by co-learning. To that end, in this work,\nwe provide a comprehensive survey on the emerging area of multimodal\nco-learning that has not been explored in its entirety yet. We review\nimplementations that overcome one or more co-learning challenges without\nexplicitly considering them as co-learning challenges. We present the\ncomprehensive taxonomy of multimodal co-learning based on the challenges\naddressed by co-learning and associated implementations. The various techniques\nemployed to include the latest ones are reviewed along with some of the\napplications and datasets. Our final goal is to discuss challenges and\nperspectives along with the important ideas and directions for future work that\nwe hope to be beneficial for the entire research community focusing on this\nexciting domain.",

Most\nRL algorithms typically assume that the environment satisfies Markov\nassumptions (i.e. the probability distribution over the next state depends only\non the current state).

Since two arms are occupied for the\noverhead task, it is desired to have additional arms to assist us in achieving\nother subtasks such as supporting the far end of a long plate and pushing it\nupward to fit in the ceiling. In this study, a method that maps human muscle\nforce to SRD for overhead task assistance is proposed. Our methodology is to\nutilize redundant DoFs such as the idle muscles in the leg to control the\nsupporting force of the SRD. A sEMG device is worn on the operator's shank\nwhere muscle signals are measured, parsed, and transmitted to SRD for control.\nIn the control aspect, we adopted stiffness control in the task space based on\ntorque control at the joint level. We are motivated by the fact that humans can\nachieve daily manipulation merely through simple inherent compliance property\nin joint driven by muscles. We explore to estimate the force of some particular\nmuscles in humans and control the SRD to imitate the behaviors of muscle and\noutput supporting forces to accomplish the subtasks such as overhead\nsupporting. The sEMG signals detected from human muscles are extracted,\nfiltered, rectified, and parsed to estimate the muscle force. We use this force\ninformation as the intent of the operator for proper overhead supporting force.\nAs one of the well-known compliance control methods, stiffness control is easy\nto achieve using a few of straightforward parameters such as stiffness and\nequilibrium point. Through tuning the stiffness and equilibrium point, the\nsupporting force of SRD in task space can be easily controlled.

    "title": "Generalisations of Matrix Partitions : Complexity and Obstructions",
    "abstract": "A trigraph is a graph where each pair of vertices is labelled either 0 (a\nnon-edge), 1 (an edge) or $\\star$ (both an edge and a non-edge). In a series of\npapers, Hell et al. proposed to study the complexity of homomorphisms from\ngraphs to trigraphs, called Matrix Partition Problems, where edges and\nnon-edges can be both mapped to $\\star$-edges, while a non-edge cannot be\nmapped to an edge, and vice-versa. Even though, Matrix Partition Problems are\ngeneralisations of CSPs, they share with them the property of being\n\"intrinsically\" combinatorial. So, the question of a possible dichotomy, i.e.\nP-time vs NP-complete, is a very natural one and raised in Hell et al.'s\npapers. We propose in this paper to study Matrix Partition Problems on\nrelational structures, wrt a dichotomy question, and, in particular,\nhomomorphisms between trigraphs. We first show that trigraph homomorphisms and\nMatrix Partition Problems are P-time equivalent, and then prove that one can\nalso restrict (wrt dichotomy) to relational structures with one relation.\nFailing in proving that Matrix Partition Problems on directed graphs are not\nP-time equivalent to Matrix Partitions on relational structures, we give some\nevidence that it is unlikely by showing that reductions used in the case of\nCSPs cannot work. We turn then our attention to Matrix Partitions with finite\nsets of obstructions. We show that, for a fixed trigraph, the set of\ninclusion-wise minimal obstructions is finite for directed graphs if and only\nif it is finite for trigraphs. We also prove similar results for relational\nstructures. We conclude by showing that on trees (seen as trigraphs) it is\nNP-complete to decide whether a given tree has a trigraph homomorphism to\nanother input trigraph. The latter shows a notable difference on tractability\nbetween CSP and Matrix Partition as it is well-known that CSP is tractable on\nthe class of trees.",

    "title": "From Continuity to Editability: Inverting GANs with Consecutive Images",
    "abstract": "Existing GAN inversion methods are stuck in a paradox that the inverted codes\ncan either achieve high-fidelity reconstruction, or retain the editing\ncapability. Having only one of them clearly cannot realize real image editing.\nIn this paper, we resolve this paradox by introducing consecutive images (\\eg,\nvideo frames or the same person with different poses) into the inversion\nprocess. The rationale behind our solution is that the continuity of\nconsecutive images leads to inherent editable directions. This inborn property\nis used for two unique purposes: 1) regularizing the joint inversion process,\nsuch that each of the inverted code is semantically accessible from one of the\nother and fastened in a editable domain; 2) enforcing inter-image coherence,\nsuch that the fidelity of each inverted code can be maximized with the\ncomplement of other images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nalternative significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of\nreconstruction fidelity and editability on both the real image dataset and\nsynthesis dataset. Furthermore, our method provides the first support of\nvideo-based GAN inversion, and an interesting application of unsupervised\nsemantic transfer from consecutive images.

The convergence speed is a key factor to be\nconsidered for distributed algorithms, and it is shown dependent on the\nspectral radius of the iteration matrix. However, the iteration matrix is\ndetermined by the network structure and is hardly pre-tuned, making the\niterative-based distributed algorithms may converge very slowly when the\nspectral radius is close to 1. In contrast, in centralized optimization, the\nConjugate Gradient (CG) is a widely adopted idea to speed up the convergence of\nthe centralized solvers, which can guarantee convergence in fixed steps. In\nthis paper, we propose a general distributed implementation of CG, called DCG.\nDCG only needs local communication and local computation, while inheriting the\ncharacteristic of fast convergence. DCG guarantees to converge in $4Hn$ rounds,\nwhere $H$ is the maximum hop number of the network and $n$ is the number of\nnodes. We present the applications of DCG in solving the least square problem\nand network localization problem.

    "abstract": "In recent years, sparse voxel-based methods have become the state-of-the-arts\nfor 3D semantic segmentation of indoor scenes, thanks to the powerful 3D CNNs.\nNevertheless, being oblivious to the underlying geometry, voxel-based methods\nsuffer from ambiguous features on spatially close objects and struggle with\nhandling complex and irregular geometries due to the lack of geodesic\ninformation. In view of this, we present Voxel-Mesh Network (VMNet), a novel 3D\ndeep architecture that operates on the voxel and mesh representations\nleveraging both the Euclidean and geodesic information. Intuitively, the\nEuclidean information extracted from voxels can offer contextual cues\nrepresenting interactions between nearby objects, while the geodesic\ninformation extracted from meshes can help separate objects that are spatially\nclose but have disconnected surfaces. To incorporate such information from the\ntwo domains, we design an intra-domain attentive module for effective feature\naggregation and an inter-domain attentive module for adaptive feature fusion.\nExperimental results validate the effectiveness of VMNet: specifically, on the\nchallenging ScanNet dataset for large-scale segmentation of indoor scenes, it\noutperforms the state-of-the-art SparseConvNet and MinkowskiNet (74.6% vs 72.5%\nand 73.6% in mIoU) with a simpler network structure (17M vs 30M and 38M\nparameters).

    "abstract": "Steganalysis is a collection of techniques used to detect whether secret\ninformation is embedded in a carrier using steganography. Most of the existing\nsteganalytic methods are based on machine learning, which typically requires\ntraining a classifier with \"laboratory\" data. However, applying\nmachine-learning classification to a new source of data is challenging, since\nthere is typically a mismatch between the training and the testing sets. In\naddition, other sources of uncertainty affect the steganlytic process,\nincluding the mismatch between the targeted and the true steganographic\nalgorithms, unknown parameters -- such as the message length -- and even having\na mixture of several algorithms and parameters, which would constitute a\nrealistic scenario. This paper presents subsequent embedding as a valuable\nstrategy that can be incorporated into modern steganalysis. Although this\nsolution has been applied in previous works, a theoretical basis for this\nstrategy was missing. Here, we cover this research gap by introducing the\n\"directionality\" property of features with respect to data embedding. Once this\nstrategy is sustained by a consistent theoretical framework, new practical\napplications are also described and tested against standard steganography,\nmoving steganalysis closer to real-world conditions.",

Then, we use those critical\npoints as the initial evolutionary seeds of the quasi-genetic algorithm. After\nevolving into several generations such as twenty generations, we obtain a\nsuboptimal point of the optimization problem.

    "abstract": "Recommender systems (RSs) employ user-item feedback, e.g., ratings, to match\ncustomers to personalized lists of products. Approaches to top-k recommendation\nmainly rely on Learning-To-Rank algorithms and, among them, the most widely\nadopted is Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), which bases on a pair-wise\noptimization approach. Recently, BPR has been found vulnerable against\nadversarial perturbations of its model parameters. Adversarial Personalized\nRanking (APR) mitigates this issue by robustifying BPR via an adversarial\ntraining procedure. The empirical improvements of APR's accuracy performance on\nBPR have led to its wide use in several recommender models. However, a key\noverlooked aspect has been the beyond-accuracy performance of APR, i.e.,\nnovelty, coverage, and amplification of popularity bias, considering that\nrecent results suggest that BPR, the building block of APR, is sensitive to the\nintensification of biases and reduction of recommendation novelty. In this\nwork, we model the learning characteristics of the BPR and APR optimization\nframeworks to give mathematical evidence that, when the feedback data have a\ntailed distribution, APR amplifies the popularity bias more than BPR due to an\nunbalanced number of received positive updates from short-head items. Using\nmatrix factorization (MF), we empirically validate the theoretical results by\nperforming preliminary experiments on two public datasets to compare BPR-MF and\nAPR-MF performance on accuracy and beyond-accuracy metrics.

    "abstract": "This paper presents an evaluation of efficient radial basis function mesh\ndeformation for complex iced geometries. Given the high computational cost of\nmesh deformation, state-of-the-art radial basis function techniques are used\nfor data reduction. The principle procedures adopted are multi-level greedy\nsurface point selection and volume point reduction. The multi-level greedy\nsurface point selection reduces the control point list to increase the\nefficiency of the interpolation operation and the volume point reduction\nimproves the computational cost of the volume mesh update operation which is\nimportant for large data sets. The study demonstrates the capabilities of\nradial basis function mesh deformation in both two and three-dimensions.\nFurthermore, it compares localised ice deformation to more standardized test\ncases with global deformation. The convergence history of the multi-level\ngreedy point selection is assessed in terms of number of control points and\ncomputational cost for all the test cases. The location of the selected control\npoints near the ice accretion illustrates the effectiveness of the method for\nlocalised deformation. The results show that the radial basis function mesh\ndeformation performs well for both the two and three-dimensional test cases.\nThe reduction of the relative surface error for the three-dimensional test\ncases understandably requires a larger number of control points and thus\nresults in a higher computational cost. Nevertheless, the data-reduction\nschemes presented in this work represent a significant improvement to standard\nradial basis function mesh deformation for three-dimensional aircraft icing\ntests with large data-sets.",

The majority of Re-ID methods focus on\nsmall-scale surveillance systems in which each pedestrian is captured in\ndifferent camera views of adjacent scenes. However, in large-scale surveillance\nsystems that cover larger areas, it is required to track a pedestrian of\ninterest across distant scenes (e.g., a criminal suspect escapes from one city\nto another). Since most pedestrians appear in limited local areas, it is\ndifficult to collect training data with cross-camera pairs of the same person.\nIn this work, we study intra-camera supervised person re-identification across\ndistant scenes (ICS-DS Re-ID), which uses cross-camera unpaired data with\nintra-camera identity labels for training. It is challenging as cross-camera\npaired data plays a crucial role for learning camera-invariant features in most\nexisting Re-ID methods. To learn camera-invariant representation from\ncross-camera unpaired training data, we propose a cross-camera feature\nprediction method to mine cross-camera self supervision information from\ncamera-specific feature distribution by transforming fake cross-camera positive\nfeature pairs and minimize the distances of the fake pairs. Furthermore, we\nautomatically localize and extract local-level feature by a transformer. Joint\nlearning of global-level and local-level features forms a global-local\ncross-camera feature prediction scheme for mining fine-grained cross-camera\nself supervision information. Finally, cross-camera self supervision and\nintra-camera supervision are aggregated in a framework. The experiments are\nconducted in the ICS-DS setting on Market-SCT, Duke-SCT and MSMT17-SCT\ndatasets.

Then we choose a linear finite difference scheme with suitable order of\naccuracy for the auxiliary variable(s), and two WENO schemes with unequal-sized\nsub-stencils for the primal variable. One WENO scheme uses one large stencil\nand several smaller stencils, and the other WENO scheme is based on the\nmulti-resolution idea which uses a series of unequal-sized hierarchical central\nstencils. Comparing with the classical WENO schemes which uses several small\nstencils of the same size to make up a big stencil, both WENO schemes with\nunequal-sized sub-stencils are simple in the the choice of the stencil and\nenjoy the freedom of arbitrary positive linear weights. Another advantage is\nthat the final reconstructed polynomial on the target cell is a polynomial of\nthe same degree as the polynomial over the big stencil, while the classical\nfinite difference WENO reconstruction can only be obtained for specific points\ninside the target interval.

    "title": "Learning Geometry-Guided Depth via Projective Modeling for Monocular 3D  Object Detection",
    "abstract": "As a crucial task of autonomous driving, 3D object detection has made great\nprogress in recent years. However, monocular 3D object detection remains a\nchallenging problem due to the unsatisfactory performance in depth estimation.\nMost existing monocular methods typically directly regress the scene depth\nwhile ignoring important relationships between the depth and various geometric\nelements (e.g. bounding box sizes, 3D object dimensions, and object poses). In\nthis paper, we propose to learn geometry-guided depth estimation with\nprojective modeling to advance monocular 3D object detection. Specifically, a\nprincipled geometry formula with projective modeling of 2D and 3D depth\npredictions in the monocular 3D object detection network is devised. We further\nimplement and embed the proposed formula to enable geometry-aware deep\nrepresentation learning, allowing effective 2D and 3D interactions for boosting\nthe depth estimation. Moreover, we provide a strong baseline through addressing\nsubstantial misalignment between 2D annotation and projected boxes to ensure\nrobust learning with the proposed geometric formula. Experiments on the KITTI\ndataset show that our method remarkably improves the detection performance of\nthe state-of-the-art monocular-based method without extra data by 2.80% on the\nmoderate test setting. The model and code will be released at\nhttps://github.com/YinminZhang/MonoGeo.",

In this work, we introduce the \"Break, Perturb, Build\" (BPB)\nframework for automatic reasoning-oriented perturbation of question-answer\npairs. BPB represents a question by decomposing it into the reasoning steps\nthat are required to answer it, symbolically perturbs the decomposition, and\nthen generates new question-answer pairs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nBPB by creating evaluation sets for three reading comprehension (RC)\nbenchmarks, generating thousands of high-quality examples without human\nintervention. We evaluate a range of RC models on our evaluation sets, which\nreveals large performance gaps on generated examples compared to the original\ndata. Moreover, symbolic perturbations enable fine-grained analysis of the\nstrengths and limitations of models. Last, augmenting the training data with\nexamples generated by BPB helps close performance gaps, without any drop on the\noriginal data distribution.",

However, in\nmany real-world RL problems, besides optimizing the main objectives, the agent\nis expected to satisfy a certain level of safety (e.g., avoiding collisions in\nautonomous driving). While RL problems are commonly formalized as Markov\ndecision processes (MDPs), safety constraints are incorporated via constrained\nMarkov decision processes (CMDPs). Although recent advances in safe RL have\nenabled learning safe policies in CMDPs, these safety requirements should be\nsatisfied during both training and in the deployment process. Furthermore, it\nis shown that in memory-based and partially observable environments, these\nmethods fail to maintain safety over unseen out-of-distribution observations.\nTo address these limitations, we propose a Lyapunov-based uncertainty-aware\nsafe RL model. The introduced model adopts a Lyapunov function that converts\ntrajectory-based constraints to a set of local linear constraints. Furthermore,\nto ensure the safety of the agent in highly uncertain environments, an\nuncertainty quantification method is developed that enables identifying\nrisk-averse actions through estimating the probability of constraint\nviolations. Moreover, a Transformers model is integrated to provide the agent\nwith memory to process long time horizons of information via the self-attention\nmechanism. The proposed model is evaluated in grid-world navigation tasks where\nsafety is defined as avoiding static and dynamic obstacles in fully and\npartially observable environments. The results of these experiments show a\nsignificant improvement in the performance of the agent both in achieving\noptimality and satisfying safety constraints.",

In this\npaper, we investigate the insensitivity of natural language models to\nword-order by quantifying perturbations and analysing their effect on neural\nmodels' performance on language understanding tasks in GLUE benchmark. Towards\nthat end, we propose two metrics - the Direct Neighbour Displacement (DND) and\nthe Index Displacement Count (IDC) - that score the local and global ordering\nof tokens in the perturbed texts and observe that perturbation functions found\nin prior literature affect only the global ordering while the local ordering\nremains relatively unperturbed.

Here, we introduce and formalize the problem of the k-shell attack and\ndevelop an efficient strategy to attack the k-shell structure by rewiring a\nsmall number of links. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to\nstudy the robustness of graph k-shell structure under adversarial attacks. In\nparticular, we propose a Simulated Annealing (SA) based k-shell attack method\nand testify it on four real-world social networks. The extensive experiments\nvalidate that the k-shell structure of a network is robust under random\nperturbation, but it is quite vulnerable under adversarial attack, e.g., in\nDolphin and Throne networks, more than 40% nodes change their k-shell values\nwhen only 10% links are changed based on our SA-based k-shell attack. Such\nresults suggest that a single structural feature could also be significantly\ndisturbed when only a small fraction of links are changed purposefully in a\nnetwork.

To date, it is\nwidely accepted that performance will degrade over time due to changes in care\nprocesses and patient populations. However, the extent to which this occurs is\npoorly understood, in part because few researchers report prospective\nvalidation performance. In this study, we compare the 2020-2021 ('20-'21)\nprospective performance of a patient risk stratification model for predicting\nhealthcare-associated infections to a 2019-2020 ('19-'20) retrospective\nvalidation of the same model.

We estimate how i) \"temporal\nshift\", i.e., changes in clinical workflows and patient populations, and ii)\n\"infrastructure shift\", i.e., changes in access, extraction and transformation\nof data, both contribute to the performance gap. Applied prospectively to\n26,864 hospital encounters during a twelve-month period from July 2020 to June\n2021, the model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic\ncurve (AUROC) of 0.767 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.737, 0.801) and a Brier\nscore of 0.189 (95% CI: 0.186, 0.191).

The resulting performance gap was primarily due to\ninfrastructure shift and not temporal shift. So long as we continue to develop\nand validate models using data stored in large research data warehouses, we\nmust consider differences in how and when data are accessed, measure how these\ndifferences may affect prospective performance, and work to mitigate those\ndifferences.",

Several years ago, Comcast helped to fund research and\ndevelopment in the technical community into new Active Queue Management (AQM)\ntechniques to eliminate this issue and AQM was later built into Data Over Cable\nService Interface Specification (DOCSIS) standards.\nJust prior to the pandemic, Comcast also deployed a large-scale network\nperformance measurement system that included a latency under load test.

This fortuitous confluence of\nevents has enabled Comcast to perform a comparative analysis of the differences\nbetween cable modem gateways using AQM with those that lack that enhancement,\nat a unique level of scale across many months of time and millions of devices.\nThe data reveals significantly better upstream latency under load performance\nwhen AQM is used.

We experimented with 3 kinds of\nmodels: Jigsaw solving as pretext task, adversarial learning (SRGAN) and\ncontrastive learning based (SimCLR) model. The learned features are used for\ndownstream tasks such as fine-grained image classification. Our code is\navailable at\nthis http URL",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the design of B-tree that can take full advantage of\nmodern storage hardware with built-in transparent compression. Recent years\nhave witnessed significant interest in applying log-structured merge tree\n(LSM-tree) as an alternative to B-tree. The current consensus is that, compared\nwith B-tree, LSM-tree has distinct advantages in terms of storage space\nefficiency and write amplification. This paper argues that one should revisit\nthis belief upon the arrival of storage hardware with built-in transparent\ncompression. Advanced storage appliances~(e.g., all-flash array) and emerging\ncomputational storage drives perform hardware-based lossless data compression,\ntransparent to OS and user applications. Beyond straightforwardly reducing the\nphysical storage cost difference between B-tree and LSM-tree, such modern\nstorage hardware brings new opportunities to innovate B-tree implementation in\norder to largely reduce its write amplification. As the first step to explore\nthe potential, this paper presents three simple design techniques (i.e.,\ndeterministic page shadowing, localized page modification logging, and sparse\nredo logging) that can leverage such modern storage hardware to significantly\nreduce the B-tree write amplification. We implemented these design techniques\nand carried out experiments on a commercial storage drive with built-in\ntransparent compression. The results show that the proposed design techniques\ncan reduce the B-tree write amplification by over 10x. Compared with RocksDB (a\npopular key-value store built upon LSM-tree), the implemented B-tree can\nachieve similar or even smaller write amplification and physical storage space\nusage.",

    "abstract": "Most of the existing 3D human pose estimation approaches mainly focus on\npredicting 3D positional relationships between the root joint and other human\njoints (local motion) instead of the overall trajectory of the human body\n(global motion). Despite the great progress achieved by these approaches, they\nare not robust to global motion, and lack the ability to accurately predict\nlocal motion with a small movement range. To alleviate these two problems, we\npropose a relative information encoding method that yields positional and\ntemporal enhanced representations. Firstly, we encode positional information by\nutilizing relative coordinates of 2D poses to enhance the consistency between\nthe input and output distribution. The same posture with different absolute 2D\npositions can be mapped to a common representation. It is beneficial to resist\nthe interference of global motion on the prediction results. Second, we encode\ntemporal information by establishing the connection between the current pose\nand other poses of the same person within a period of time. More attention will\nbe paid to the movement changes before and after the current pose, resulting in\nbetter prediction performance on local motion with a small movement range. The\nablation studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed relative\ninformation encoding method. Besides, we introduce a multi-stage optimization\nmethod to the whole framework to further exploit the positional and temporal\nenhanced representations.

The vast majority of\nperturbation-based XAI techniques face the challenge of Out-of-Distribution\n(OoD) data -- an artifact of randomly perturbed data becoming inconsistent with\nthe original dataset. OoD data leads to the over-confidence problem in model\npredictions, making the existing XAI approaches unreliable. To our best\nknowledge, the OoD data problem in perturbation-based XAI algorithms has not\nbeen adequately addressed in the literature. In this work, we address this OoD\ndata problem by designing an additional module quantifying the affinity between\nthe perturbed data and the original dataset distribution, which is integrated\ninto the process of aggregation. Our solution is shown to be compatible with\nthe most popular perturbation-based XAI algorithms, such as RISE, OCCLUSION,\nand LIME. Experiments have confirmed that our methods demonstrate a significant\nimprovement in general cases using both computational and cognitive metrics.\nEspecially in the case of degradation, our proposed approach demonstrates\noutstanding performance comparing to baselines.

Explanatory visualisation has the potential to\ndisplay these paths of redress in a clear way, such that people can see,\nunderstand and explore their options. The visualisation challenge is further\ncomplicated because information is spread across many documents, laws, guidance\nand policies and requires judicial interpretation.

    "abstract": "Respiratory rate (RR) is a clinical metric used to assess overall health and\nphysical fitness. An individual's RR can change from their baseline due to\nchronic illness symptoms (e.g., asthma, congestive heart failure), acute\nillness (e.g., breathlessness due to infection), and over the course of the day\ndue to physical exhaustion during heightened exertion. Remote estimation of RR\ncan offer a cost-effective method to track disease progression and\ncardio-respiratory fitness over time. This work investigates a model-driven\napproach to estimate RR from short audio segments obtained after physical\nexertion in healthy adults. Data was collected from 21 individuals using\nmicrophone-enabled, near-field headphones before, during, and after strenuous\nexercise. RR was manually annotated by counting perceived inhalations and\nexhalations. A multi-task Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network with\nconvolutional layers was implemented to process mel-filterbank energies,\nestimate RR in varying background noise conditions, and predict heavy\nbreathing, indicated by an RR of more than 25 breaths per minute. The\nmulti-task model performs both classification and regression tasks and\nleverages a mixture of loss functions. It was observed that RR can be estimated\nwith a concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.76 and a mean squared\nerror (MSE) of 0.2, demonstrating that audio can be a viable signal for\napproximating RR.",

    "title": "UNITI Mobile -- EMI-Apps for a Large-Scale European Study on Tinnitus",
    "abstract": "More and more observational studies exploit the achievements of mobile\ntechnology to ease the overall implementation procedure. Many strategies like\ndigital phenotyping, ecological momentary assessments or mobile crowdsensing\nare used in this context. Recently, an increasing number of intervention\nstudies makes use of mobile technology as well. For the chronic disorder\ntinnitus, only few long-running intervention studies exist, which use mobile\ntechnology in a larger setting. Tinnitus is characterized by its heterogeneous\npatient's symptom profiles, which complicates the development of general\ntreatments. In the UNITI project, researchers from different European countries\ntry to unify existing treatments and interventions to cope with this\nheterogeneity. One study arm (UNITI Mobile) exploits mobile technology to\ninvestigate newly implemented interventions types, especially within the\npan-European setting. The goals are to learn more about the validity and\nusefulness of mobile technology in this context. Furthermore, differences among\nthe countries shall be investigated. Practically, two native intervention apps\nhave been developed for UNITI and the mobile study arm, which pose features not\npresented so far in other apps of the authors. Along the implementation\nprocedure, it is discussed whether these features might leverage similar types\nof studies in future. Since instruments like the mHealth evidence reporting and\nassessment checklist (mERA), developed by the WHO mHealth technical evidence\nreview group, indicate that aspects shown for UNITI Mobile are important in the\ncontext of health interventions using mobile phones, our findings may be of a\nmore general interest and are therefore being discussed in the work at hand.",

    "abstract": "Women, visible minorities, and other socially disadvantaged groups continue\nto be underrepresented in STEM education. Understanding students' motivations\nfor pursuing a STEM major, and the roles gender, ethnicity, parental education\nattainment, and socio-economic background play in shaping students' motivations\ncan support the design of more effective recruitment efforts towards these\ngroups. In this paper, we propose and develop a novel text mining approach\nincorporating the Latent Dirichlet Allocation and word embeddings to extract\nand analyze applicants' motivational factors to choosing an engineering\nprogram. We apply the proposed method to a data set of over 40,000 applications\nto the engineering school of a large North American university. We then\ninvestigate the relationship between applicants' gender, nationality, family\nincome, and educational attainment, and their stated motivations for applying\nto their engineering program of choice. We find that interest in technology and\nthe desire to make social impacts are the two most powerful motivators for\napplicants. Additionally, while we find significant motivational differences\nrelated to applicants' nationality and family socioeconomic status, gender\ndifferences are isolated from the effects of these factors.",

    "abstract": "High-quality computer science education is limited by the difficulty of\nproviding instructor feedback to students at scale. While this feedback could\nin principle be automated, supervised approaches to predicting the correct\nfeedback are bottlenecked by the intractability of annotating large quantities\nof student code. In this paper, we instead frame the problem of providing\nfeedback as few-shot classification, where a meta-learner adapts to give\nfeedback to student code on a new programming question from just a few examples\nannotated by instructors. Because data for meta-training is limited, we propose\na number of amendments to the typical few-shot learning framework, including\ntask augmentation to create synthetic tasks, and additional side information to\nbuild stronger priors about each task. These additions are combined with a\ntransformer architecture to embed discrete sequences (e.g. code) to a\nprototypical representation of a feedback class label. On a suite of few-shot\nnatural language processing tasks, we match or outperform state-of-the-art\nperformance. Then, on a collection of student solutions to exam questions from\nan introductory university course, we show that our approach reaches an average\nprecision of 88% on unseen questions, surpassing the 82% precision of teaching\nassistants. Our approach was successfully deployed to deliver feedback to\n16,000 student exam-solutions in a programming course offered by a tier 1\nuniversity. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first successful\ndeployment of a machine learning based feedback to open-ended student code.",

A previous bitmap web\nAtlas was created in 1996, and was a pilot activity investigating the potential\nfor using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) in the South Pacific. The\nobjective of the new atlas is to provide sets of spatial and attributive data\nand maps for use of educators, students, researchers, policy makers and other\nrelevant user groups and the public. GIS is a highly flexible and dynamic\ntechnology that allows the construction and analysis of maps and data sets from\na variety of sources and formats. Nowadays, GIS application has moved from\nlocal and client-server applications to a three-tier architecture: Client (Web\nBrowser) -- Application Web Map Server -- Spatial Data Warehouses. The\nobjective of this project is to produce an Atlas that will include interactive\nmaps and data on an Application Web Map Server. Intergraph products such as\nGeoMedia Professional, Web Map and Web Publisher have been selected for the web\natlas production and design. In an interactive environment, an atlas will be\ncomposed from a series of maps and data profiles, which will be based on legend\nentries, queries, hot spots and cartographic tools.

The closed\nquestionnaire revealed the most preferred learning elements, and the open\nquestionnaire was to clarify their reasons. The data were arranged sequentially\nfrom the quantitative data to the qualitative data. The results of the study\nshowed that (1) the preferred online platforms were Moodle, Google Meet, and\nWhatsApp. They like Moodle because the content is well structured, Google Meet\nis easily accessible, and WhatsApp is their daily routine application; (2) The\nlearning content consists of 2 to 3 resources i.e.: 6-10 pages papers, 11-15\npages PowerPoint and 6-10 minute videos. Too much content causes a heavy\nlearning burden; (3) Most students preferred the blended learning strategy.

Such difficulties paved way for the\non-going research on few-shot learning and continual learning. To tackle these\nproblems, we introduce Attentive Independent Mechanisms (AIM). We incorporate\nthe idea of learning using fast and slow weights in conjunction with the\ndecoupling of the feature extraction and higher-order conceptual learning of a\nDNN. AIM is designed for higher-order conceptual learning, modeled by a mixture\nof experts that compete to learn independent concepts to solve a new task. AIM\nis a modular component that can be inserted into existing deep learning\nframeworks. We demonstrate its capability for few-shot learning by adding it to\nSIB and trained on MiniImageNet and CIFAR-FS, showing significant improvement.\nAIM is also applied to ANML and OML trained on Omniglot, CIFAR-100 and\nMiniImageNet to demonstrate its capability in continual learning.

First, we describe how starting from\nthe individual description of predator-prey dynamics, it is possible to derive\nthe mean-field equations for the homogeneous and heterogeneous space cases.\nThen, we see that the new approach is able to preserve the order and that it\nconverges to the mean-field solutions as the sample size increases. We show how\nto simulate the dynamics with the new approach, performing different numerical\nexperiments in order to test its efficiency.

A dataset from Shanxi Province is used to identify the risk of each\npatient's at four states low/medium/high/attack and provide the state\ntransition tendency through a SHAP DeepExplainer. To improve the accuracy on an\nimbalance sample set, the Quadratic Interactive Deep Neural Network (QIDNN)\nmodel is first proposed by flexible selecting and appending of quadratic\ninteractive features. The experimental results showed that the QIDNN model with\n7 interactive features achieve the state-of-art accuracy $83.25\\%$. Blood\npressure, physical inactivity, smoking, weight and total cholesterol are the\ntop five important features. Then, for the sake of high recall on the most\nurgent state, attack state, the stroke occurrence prediction is taken as an\nauxiliary objective to benefit from multi-objective optimization. The\nprediction accuracy was promoted, meanwhile the recall of the attack state was\nimproved by $24.9\\%$ (to $84.83\\%$) compared to QIDNN (from $67.93\\%$) with\nsame features.

Such high-dimensional models may manifest\ninstabilities and weird properties that resemble complex systems. Therefore, we\npropose Complex Network (CN) techniques to analyze the structure and\nperformance of fully connected neural networks. For that, we build a dataset\nwith 4 thousand models and their respective CN properties. They are employed in\na supervised classification setup considering four vision benchmarks. Each\nneural network is approached as a weighted and undirected graph of neurons and\nsynapses, and centrality measures are computed after training. Results show\nthat these measures are highly related to the network classification\nperformance. We also propose the concept of Bag-Of-Neurons (BoN), a CN-based\napproach for finding topological signatures linking similar neurons. Results\nsuggest that six neuronal types emerge in such networks, independently of the\ntarget domain, and are distributed differently according to classification\naccuracy. We also tackle specific CN properties related to performance, such as\nhigher subgraph centrality on lower-performing models.

The TERRA-REF program deployed a suite of high\nresolution, cutting edge technology sensors on a gantry system with the aim of\nscanning 1 hectare (~$10^4$ m) at around $1 mm^2$ spatial resolution multiple\ntimes per week. The system contains co-located sensors including a stereo-pair\nRGB camera, a thermal imager, a laser scanner to capture 3D structure, and two\nhyperspectral cameras covering wavelengths of 300-2500nm. This sensor data is\nprovided alongside over sixty types of traditional plant measurements that can\nbe used to train new machine learning models. Associated weather and\nenvironmental measurements, information about agronomic management and\nexperimental design, and the genomic sequences of hundreds of plant varieties\nhave been collected and are available alongside the sensor and plant trait\n(phenotype) data.\nOver the course of four years and ten growing seasons, the TERRA-REF system\ngenerated over 1 PB of sensor data and almost 45 million files.

The high morbidity and mortality rates of Dengue\nfever impose a huge economic and health burden for middle and low-income\ncountries. It is so prevalent in such regions that enforcing a granular level\nof surveillance is quite impossible. Therefore, it is crucial to explore an\nalternative cost-effective solution that can provide updates of the ongoing\nsituation in a timely manner. In this paper, we explore the scope and potential\nof a local newspaper-based dengue surveillance system, using well-known\ndata-mining techniques, in Bangladesh from the analysis of the news contents\nwritten in the native language. In addition, we explain the working procedure\nof developing a novel database, using human-in-the-loop technique, for further\nanalysis, and classification of dengue and its intervention-related news. Our\nclassification method has an f-score of 91.45%, and matches the ground truth of\nreported cases quite closely. Based on the dengue and intervention-related\nnews, we identified the regions where more intervention efforts are needed to\nreduce the rate of dengue infection.

    "abstract": "A negotiating team is a group of two or more agents who join together as a\nsingle negotiating party because they share a common goal related to the\nnegotiation. Since a negotiating team is composed of several stakeholders,\nrepresented as a single negotiating party, there is need for a voting rule for\nthe team to reach decisions. In this paper, we investigate the problem of\nstrategic voting in the context of negotiating teams. Specifically, we present\na polynomial-time algorithm that finds a manipulation for a single voter when\nusing a positional scoring rule. We show that the problem is still tractable\nwhen there is a coalition of manipulators that uses a x-approval rule. The\ncoalitional manipulation problem becomes computationally hard when using Borda,\nbut we provide a polynomial-time algorithm with the following guarantee: given\na manipulable instance with k manipulators, the algorithm finds a successful\nmanipulation with at most one additional manipulator. Our results hold for both\nconstructive and destructive manipulations.",

    "abstract": "In the event of a kidnapping or a medical emergency, a person is often\nincapacitated to be able to call for help. And it's usually too late before the\nfirst responders arrive on-scene. Currently, a vast array of 'safety' devices\navailable in the market are often far too rudimentary such as double tapping\nthe power button that isn't very practical, or an app on a smart watch that is\na huge investment in the first place. The Smart Band aims to eliminate the need\nfor a physical trigger by the person who finds himself in dangerous situations\nlike kidnapping, front-facing some wild animal, heart attack, etc., and rather\nsenses the heartbeat. The Smart Band is designed as a personalized wearable\ndevice, wherein the user heart beat rate is collected and trained using machine\nlearning algorithm, which triggers the alert system automatically when the\nevent is identified. Hence the accuracy of assessing emergency situation will\nbe high and false rate will be reduced. As soon as the event is detected, the\nband relays GPS coordinates to first responders and emergency contacts, which\nwill be sent via the Network Carrier (SIM card module) directly from the band,\nnot relying on a mobile phone, which is usually out of reach during such\nemergency situations. In essence, the Smart Band consists of a GPS tracker, a\nheartbeat sensor, a Network module, and a Bluetooth module, all existing\ntechnologies which have been mass produced to an extent that the end product\ncan be made affordable, and in huge quantities as well. On further development\nthe smart band can be customized to a finely wearable jewel which can serve the\npurpose autonomously.",

However, many\ntravellers prefer to avoid risky or unpleasant road conditions such as roads\nwith high crime rates (e.g., robberies, kidnapping, riots etc.) and bumpy\nroads. To facilitate safe travel, we introduce a novel query for road networks\ncalled the $k$ safest nearby neighbors ($k$SNN) query. Given a query location\n$v_l$, a distance constraint $d_c$ and a point of interest $p_i$, we define the\nsafest path from $v_l$ to $p_i$ as the path with the highest path safety score\namong all the paths from $v_l$ to $p_i$ with length less than $d_c$. The path\nsafety score is computed considering the road safety of each road segment on\nthe path. Given a query location $v_l$, a distance constraint $d_c$ and a set\nof POIs $P$, a $k$SNN query returns $k$ POIs with the $k$ highest path safety\nscores in $P$ along with their respective safest paths from the query location.\nWe develop two novel indexing structures called $Ct$-tree and a safety score\nbased Voronoi diagram (SNVD).

    "title": "The Complexity of Growing a Graph",
    "abstract": "Motivated by biological processes, we introduce here the model of growing\ngraphs, a new model of highly dynamic networks. Such networks have as nodes\nentities that can self-replicate and thus can expand the size of the network.\nThis gives rise to the problem of creating a target network $G$ starting from a\nsingle entity (node). To properly model this, we assume that every node $u$ can\ngenerate at most one node $v$ at every round (or time slot), and every\ngenerated node $v$ can activate edges with other nodes only at the time of its\nbirth, provided that these nodes are up to a small distance $d$ away from $v$.\nWe show that the most interesting case is when the distance is $d=2$. Edge\ndeletions are allowed at any time slot. This creates a natural balance between\nhow fast (time) and how efficiently (number of deleted edges) a target network\ncan be generated. A central question here is, given a target network $G$ of $n$\nnodes, can $G$ be constructed in the model of growing graphs in at most $k$\ntime slots and with at most $\\ell$ excess edges (i.e., auxiliary edges $\\notin\nE(G)$ that are activated and later deleted)? We consider here both centralized\nand distributed algorithms for such questions (and also their computational\ncomplexity). Our results include lower bounds based on properties of the target\nnetwork and algorithms for general graph classes that try to balance speed and\nefficiency. We then show that the optimal number of time slots to construct an\ninput target graph with zero-waste (i.e., no edge deletions allowed), is hard\neven to approximate within $n^{1-\\varepsilon}$, for any $\\varepsilon>0$, unless\nP=NP. On the contrary, the question of the feasibility of constructing a given\ntarget graph in $\\log n$ time slots and zero-waste, can be answered in\npolynomial time. Finally, we initiate a discussion on possible extensions for\nthis model for a distributed setting.",

Experiments show that the multi-task model\nperforms better than single-task models. Also, in MTL, binary-branch\narchitecture more adequately utilizes information from two levels than a\nuni-branch model. For the binary-branch architecture, fine-tuning a warm-up\nmodel works better than training from scratch. Models can handle both\nsegment-level and utterance-level predictions simultaneously overall under\nbinary-branch multi-task architecture.

    "abstract": "While deep learning succeeds in a wide range of tasks, it highly depends on\nthe massive collection of annotated data which is expensive and time-consuming.\nTo lower the cost of data annotation, active learning has been proposed to\ninteractively query an oracle to annotate a small proportion of informative\nsamples in an unlabeled dataset. Inspired by the fact that the samples with\nhigher loss are usually more informative to the model than the samples with\nlower loss, in this paper we present a novel deep active learning approach that\nqueries the oracle for data annotation when the unlabeled sample is believed to\nincorporate high loss. The core of our approach is a measurement Temporal\nOutput Discrepancy (TOD) that estimates the sample loss by evaluating the\ndiscrepancy of outputs given by models at different optimization steps. Our\ntheoretical investigation shows that TOD lower-bounds the accumulated sample\nloss thus it can be used to select informative unlabeled samples. On basis of\nTOD, we further develop an effective unlabeled data sampling strategy as well\nas an unsupervised learning criterion that enhances model performance by\nincorporating the unlabeled data. Due to the simplicity of TOD, our active\nlearning approach is efficient, flexible, and task-agnostic. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior\nperformances than the state-of-the-art active learning methods on image\nclassification and semantic segmentation tasks.",

    "title": "Brexit and bots: characterizing the behaviour of automated accounts on  Twitter during the UK election",
    "abstract": "Online Social Networks represent a novel opportunity for political campaigns,\nrevolutionising the paradigm of political communication. Nevertheless, many\nstudies uncovered the presence of d/misinformation campaigns or of malicious\nactivities by genuine or automated users, putting at severe risk the\ncredibility of online platforms. This phenomenon is particularly evident during\ncrucial political events, as political elections. In the present paper, we\nprovide a comprehensive description of the structure of the networks of\ninteractions among users and bots during the UK elections of 2019. In\nparticular, we focus on the polarised discussion about Brexit on Twitter\nanalysing a data set made of more than 10 million tweets posted for over a\nmonth. We found that the presence of automated accounts fostered the debate\nparticularly in the days before the UK national elections, in which we find a\nsteep increase of bots in the discussion; in the days after the election day,\ntheir incidence returned to values similar to the ones observed few weeks\nbefore the elections. On the other hand, we found that the number of suspended\nusers (i.e. accounts that were removed by the platform for some violation of\nthe Twitter policy) remained constant until the election day, after which it\nreached significantly higher values. Remarkably, after the TV debate between\nBoris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, we observed the injection of a large number of\nnovel bots whose behaviour is markedly different from that of pre-existing\nones. Finally, we explored the bots' stance, finding that their activity is\nspread across the whole political spectrum, although in different proportions,\nand we studied the different usage of hashtags by automated accounts and\nsuspended users, thus targeting the formation of common narratives in different\nsides of the debate.",

    "title": "Probabilistic and Geometric Depth: Detecting Objects in Perspective",
    "abstract": "3D object detection is an important capability needed in various practical\napplications such as driver assistance systems. Monocular 3D detection, as an\neconomical solution compared to conventional settings relying on binocular\nvision or LiDAR, has drawn increasing attention recently but still yields\nunsatisfactory results. This paper first presents a systematic study on this\nproblem and observes that the current monocular 3D detection problem can be\nsimplified as an instance depth estimation problem: The inaccurate instance\ndepth blocks all the other 3D attribute predictions from improving the overall\ndetection performance. However, recent methods directly estimate the depth\nbased on isolated instances or pixels while ignoring the geometric relations\nacross different objects, which can be valuable constraints as the key\ninformation about depth is not directly manifest in the monocular image.\nTherefore, we construct geometric relation graphs across predicted objects and\nuse the graph to facilitate depth estimation. As the preliminary depth\nestimation of each instance is usually inaccurate in this ill-posed setting, we\nincorporate a probabilistic representation to capture the uncertainty. It\nprovides an important indicator to identify confident predictions and further\nguide the depth propagation. Despite the simplicity of the basic idea, our\nmethod obtains significant improvements on KITTI and nuScenes benchmarks,\nachieving the 1st place out of all monocular vision-only methods while still\nmaintaining real-time efficiency.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the secrecy capacity region of multiple access\nwiretap (MAC-WT) channels where, besides confidential messages, the users have\nalso open messages to transmit. All these messages are intended for the\nlegitimate receiver (or Bob for brevity) but only the confidential messages\nneed to be protected from the eavesdropper (Eve). We first consider a discrete\nmemoryless (DM) MAC-WT channel where both Bob and Eve jointly decode their\ninterested messages. By using random coding, we find an achievable rate region,\nwithin which perfect secrecy can be realized, i.e., all users can communicate\nwith Bob with arbitrarily small probability of error, while the confidential\ninformation leaked to Eve tends to zero. Due to the high implementation\ncomplexity of joint decoding, we also consider the DM MAC-WT channel where Bob\nsimply decodes messages independently while Eve still applies joint decoding.\nWe then extend the results in the DM case to a Gaussian vector (GV) MAC-WT\nchannel. Based on the information theoretic results, we further maximize the\nsum secrecy rate of the GV MAC-WT system by designing precoders for all users.\nSince the problems are non-convex, we provide iterative algorithms to obtain\nsuboptimal solutions. Simulation results show that compared with existing\nschemes, secure communication can be greatly enhanced by the proposed\nalgorithms, and in contrast to the works which only focus on the network\nsecrecy performance, the system spectrum efficiency can be effectively improved\nsince open messages can be simultaneously transmitted.",

    "abstract": "Image captioning is shown to be able to achieve a better performance by using\nscene graphs to represent the relations of objects in the image. The current\ncaptioning encoders generally use a Graph Convolutional Net (GCN) to represent\nthe relation information and merge it with the object region features via\nconcatenation or convolution to get the final input for sentence decoding.\nHowever, the GCN-based encoders in the existing methods are less effective for\ncaptioning due to two reasons. First, using the image captioning as the\nobjective (i.e., Maximum Likelihood Estimation) rather than a relation-centric\nloss cannot fully explore the potential of the encoder. Second, using a\npre-trained model instead of the encoder itself to extract the relationships is\nnot flexible and cannot contribute to the explainability of the model. To\nimprove the quality of image captioning, we propose a novel architecture\nReFormer -- a RElational transFORMER to generate features with relation\ninformation embedded and to explicitly express the pair-wise relationships\nbetween objects in the image. ReFormer incorporates the objective of scene\ngraph generation with that of image captioning using one modified Transformer\nmodel. This design allows ReFormer to generate not only better image captions\nwith the bene-fit of extracting strong relational image features, but also\nscene graphs to explicitly describe the pair-wise relation-ships.

    "abstract": "Photo-realistic point cloud capture and transmission are the fundamental\nenablers for immersive visual communication. The coding process of dynamic\npoint clouds, especially video-based point cloud compression (V-PCC) developed\nby the MPEG standardization group, is now delivering state-of-the-art\nperformance in compression efficiency. V-PCC is based on the projection of the\npoint cloud patches to 2D planes and encoding the sequence as 2D texture and\ngeometry patch sequences. However, the resulting quantization errors from\ncoding can introduce compression artifacts, which can be very unpleasant for\nthe quality of experience (QoE). In this work, we developed a novel\nout-of-the-loop point cloud geometry artifact removal solution that can\nsignificantly improve reconstruction quality without additional bandwidth cost.\nOur novel framework consists of a point cloud sampling scheme, an artifact\nremoval network, and an aggregation scheme. The point cloud sampling scheme\nemploys a cube-based neighborhood patch extraction to divide the point cloud\ninto patches. The geometry artifact removal network then processes these\npatches to obtain artifact-removed patches. The artifact-removed patches are\nthen merged together using an aggregation scheme to obtain the final\nartifact-removed point cloud. We employ 3D deep convolutional feature learning\nfor geometry artifact removal that jointly recovers both the quantization\ndirection and the quantization noise level by exploiting projection and\nquantization prior. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method\nis highly effective and can considerably improve the quality of the\nreconstructed point cloud.",

    "title": "Feature Importance-aware Transferable Adversarial Attacks",
    "abstract": "Transferability of adversarial examples is of central importance for\nattacking an unknown model, which facilitates adversarial attacks in more\npractical scenarios, e.g., blackbox attacks. Existing transferable attacks tend\nto craft adversarial examples by indiscriminately distorting features to\ndegrade prediction accuracy in a source model without aware of intrinsic\nfeatures of objects in the images. We argue that such brute-force degradation\nwould introduce model-specific local optimum into adversarial examples, thus\nlimiting the transferability. By contrast, we propose the Feature\nImportance-aware Attack (FIA), which disrupts important object-aware features\nthat dominate model decisions consistently. More specifically, we obtain\nfeature importance by introducing the aggregate gradient, which averages the\ngradients with respect to feature maps of the source model, computed on a batch\nof random transforms of the original clean image. The gradients will be highly\ncorrelated to objects of interest, and such correlation presents invariance\nacross different models. Besides, the random transforms will preserve intrinsic\nfeatures of objects and suppress model-specific information. Finally, the\nfeature importance guides to search for adversarial examples towards disrupting\ncritical features, achieving stronger transferability. Extensive experimental\nevaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and superior performance of the\nproposed FIA, i.e., improving the success rate by 8.4% against normally trained\nmodels and 11.7% against defense models as compared to the state-of-the-art\ntransferable attacks.

When these effects were uncovered in the early\n2000s, understandably, the classifiers on which they were demonstrated belonged\nto the classical rather than Deep Learning categories of approaches. As Deep\nLearning is gaining ground over classical machine learning and is beginning to\nbe used in critical applied settings, it is important to assess systematically\nhow well they respond to the kind of challenges their classical counterparts\nhave struggled with in the past two decades. The purpose of this paper is to\nstudy the behavior of deep learning systems in settings that have previously\nbeen deemed challenging to classical machine learning systems to find out\nwhether the depth of the systems is an asset in such settings. The results in\nboth artificial and real-world image datasets (MNIST Fashion, CIFAR-10) show\nthat these settings remain mostly challenging for Deep Learning systems and\nthat deeper architectures seem to help with structural concept complexity but\nnot with overlap challenges in simple artificial domains. Data scarcity is not\novercome by deeper layers, either.

We\naddress this issue by conducting the first systematic study of effectiveness of\nweb audio fingerprinting mechanisms. We focus on studying the feasibility and\ndiversity properties of web audio fingerprinting. Along with 3 known audio\nfingerprinting vectors, we designed and implemented 4 new audio fingerprint\nvectors that work by obtaining FFTs of waveforms generated via different\nmethods. Our study analyzed audio fingerprints from 2093 web users and presents\nnew insights into the nature of Web Audio fingerprints. First, we show that\naudio fingeprinting vectors, unlike other prior vectors, reveal an apparent\nfickleness with some users' browsers giving away differing fingerprints in\nrepeated attempts. However, we show that it is possible to devise a graph-based\nanalysis mechanism to collectively consider all the different fingerprints of\nusers and thus craft a stable fingerprinting mechanism. Our analysis also shows\nthat it is possible to do this in a timely fashion.\nNext, we investigate the diversity of audio fingerprints and compare this\nwith prior techniques. Our results show that audio fingerprints are much less\ndiverse than other vectors with only 95 distinct fingerprints among 2093 users.\nAt the same time, further analysis shows that web audio fingerprinting can\npotentially bring considerable additive value (in terms of entropy) to existing\nfingerprinting mechanisms.

    "title": "Gossiping with Binary Freshness Metric",
    "abstract": "We consider the binary freshness metric for gossip networks that consist of a\nsingle source and $n$ end-nodes, where the end-nodes are allowed to share their\nstored versions of the source information with the other nodes. We develop\nrecursive equations that characterize binary freshness in arbitrarily connected\ngossip networks using the stochastic hybrid systems (SHS) approach. Next, we\nstudy binary freshness in several structured gossip networks, namely\ndisconnected, ring and fully connected networks. We show that for both\ndisconnected and ring network topologies, when the number of nodes gets large,\nthe binary freshness of a node decreases down to 0 as $n^{-1}$, but the\nfreshness is strictly larger for the ring topology. We also show that for the\nfully connected topology, the rate of decrease to 0 is slower, and it takes the\nform of $n^{-\\rho}$ for a $\\rho$ smaller than 1, when the update rates of the\nsource and the end-nodes are sufficiently large. Finally, we study the binary\nfreshness metric for clustered gossip networks, where multiple clusters of\nstructured gossip networks are connected to the source node through designated\naccess nodes, i.e., cluster heads. We characterize the binary freshness in such\nnetworks and numerically study how the optimal cluster sizes change with\nrespect to the update rates in the system.",

    "abstract": "Spanners for metric spaces have been extensively studied, both in general\nmetrics and in restricted classes, perhaps most notably in low-dimensional\nEuclidean spaces -- due to their numerous applications. Euclidean spanners can\nbe viewed as means of compressing the $\\binom{n}{2}$ pairwise distances of a\n$d$-dimensional Euclidean space into $O(n) = O_{\\epsilon,d}(n)$ spanner edges,\nso that the spanner distances preserve the original distances to within a\nfactor of $1+\\epsilon$, for any $\\epsilon > 0$. Moreover, one can compute such\nspanners in optimal $O(n \\log n)$ time. Once the spanner has been computed, it\nserves as a \"proxy\" overlay network, on which the computation can proceed,\nwhich gives rise to huge savings in space and other important quality measures.\nOn the negative side, by working on the spanner rather than the original\nmetric, one loses the key property of being able to efficiently \"navigate\"\nbetween pairs of points. While in the original metric, one can go from any\npoint to any other via a direct edge, it is unclear how to efficiently navigate\nin the spanner: How can we translate the existence of a \"good\" path into an\nefficient algorithm finding it? Moreover, usually by \"good\" path we mean a path\nwhose weight approximates the original distance between its endpoints -- but a\npriori the number of edges (or \"hops\") in the path could be huge. To control\nthe hop-length of paths, one can try to upper bound the spanner's hop-diameter,\nbut naturally bounded hop-diameter spanners are more complex than spanners with\nunbounded hop-diameter, which might render the algorithmic task of efficiently\nfinding good paths more challenging.\nThe original metric enables us to navigate optimally -- a single hop (for any\ntwo points) with the exact distance, but the price is high -- $\\Theta(n^2)$\nedges.

    "abstract": "Relative position encoding (RPE) is important for transformer to capture\nsequence ordering of input tokens. General efficacy has been proven in natural\nlanguage processing. However, in computer vision, its efficacy is not well\nstudied and even remains controversial, e.g., whether relative position\nencoding can work equally well as absolute position? In order to clarify this,\nwe first review existing relative position encoding methods and analyze their\npros and cons when applied in vision transformers. We then propose new relative\nposition encoding methods dedicated to 2D images, called image RPE (iRPE). Our\nmethods consider directional relative distance modeling as well as the\ninteractions between queries and relative position embeddings in self-attention\nmechanism. The proposed iRPE methods are simple and lightweight. They can be\neasily plugged into transformer blocks. Experiments demonstrate that solely due\nto the proposed encoding methods, DeiT and DETR obtain up to 1.5% (top-1 Acc)\nand 1.3% (mAP) stable improvements over their original versions on ImageNet and\nCOCO respectively, without tuning any extra hyperparameters such as learning\nrate and weight decay. Our ablation and analysis also yield interesting\nfindings, some of which run counter to previous understanding.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised skill learning objectives (Gregor et al., 2016, Eysenbach et\nal., 2018) allow agents to learn rich repertoires of behavior in the absence of\nextrinsic rewards. They work by simultaneously training a policy to produce\ndistinguishable latent-conditioned trajectories, and a discriminator to\nevaluate distinguishability by trying to infer latents from trajectories. The\nhope is for the agent to explore and master the environment by encouraging each\nskill (latent) to reliably reach different states. However, an inherent\nexploration problem lingers: when a novel state is actually encountered, the\ndiscriminator will necessarily not have seen enough training data to produce\naccurate and confident skill classifications, leading to low intrinsic reward\nfor the agent and effective penalization of the sort of exploration needed to\nactually maximize the objective. To combat this inherent pessimism towards\nexploration, we derive an information gain auxiliary objective that involves\ntraining an ensemble of discriminators and rewarding the policy for their\ndisagreement. Our objective directly estimates the epistemic uncertainty that\ncomes from the discriminator not having seen enough training examples, thus\nproviding an intrinsic reward more tailored to the true objective compared to\npseudocount-based methods (Burda et al., 2019). We call this exploration bonus\ndiscriminator disagreement intrinsic reward, or DISDAIN. We demonstrate\nempirically that DISDAIN improves skill learning both in a tabular grid world\n(Four Rooms) and the 57 games of the Atari Suite (from pixels). Thus, we\nencourage researchers to treat pessimism with DISDAIN.",

    "abstract": "Point cloud segmentation is a fundamental task in 3D. Despite recent progress\non point cloud segmentation with the power of deep networks, current deep\nlearning methods based on the clean label assumptions may fail with noisy\nlabels. Yet, object class labels are often mislabeled in real-world point cloud\ndatasets. In this work, we take the lead in solving this issue by proposing a\nnovel Point Noise-Adaptive Learning (PNAL) framework. Compared to existing\nnoise-robust methods on image tasks, our PNAL is noise-rate blind, to cope with\nthe spatially variant noise rate problem specific to point clouds.\nSpecifically, we propose a novel point-wise confidence selection to obtain\nreliable labels based on the historical predictions of each point. A novel\ncluster-wise label correction is proposed with a voting strategy to generate\nthe best possible label taking the neighbor point correlations into\nconsideration. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of PNAL on both synthetic and real-world noisy datasets. In\nparticular, even with $60\\%$ symmetric noisy labels, our proposed method\nproduces much better results than its baseline counterpart without PNAL and is\ncomparable to the ideal upper bound trained on a completely clean dataset.\nMoreover, we fully re-labeled the test set of a popular but noisy real-world\nscene dataset ScanNetV2 to make it clean, for rigorous experiment and future\nresearch.

    "abstract": "The typical model for measurement noise in quantum error correction is to\nrandomly flip the binary measurement outcome. In experiments, measurements\nyield much richer information - e.g., continuous current values, discrete\nphoton counts - which is then mapped into binary outcomes by discarding some of\nthis information. In this work, we consider methods to incorporate all of this\nricher information, typically called soft information, into the decoding of\nquantum error correction codes, and in particular the surface code. We describe\nhow to modify both the Minimum Weight Perfect Matching and Union-Find decoders\nto leverage soft information, and demonstrate these soft decoders outperform\nthe standard (hard) decoders that can only access the binary measurement\noutcomes. Moreover, we observe that the soft decoder achieves a threshold 25\\%\nhigher than any hard decoder for phenomenological noise with Gaussian soft\nmeasurement outcomes. We also introduce a soft measurement error model with\namplitude damping, in which measurement time leads to a trade-off between\nmeasurement resolution and additional disturbance of the qubits. Under this\nmodel we observe that the performance of the surface code is very sensitive to\nthe choice of the measurement time - for a distance-19 surface code, a\nfive-fold increase in measurement time can lead to a thousand-fold increase in\nlogical error rate. Moreover, the measurement time that minimizes the physical\nerror rate is distinct from the one that minimizes the logical performance,\npointing to the benefits of jointly optimizing the physical and quantum error\ncorrection layers.",

This process, however, traditionally requires access to individual\nsource recordings, restricting the creative process. To work around this,\nsource separation algorithms can separate a mixture into its respective\ncomponents. Then, a user can adjust their levels and mix them back together.\nThis two-step approach, however, still suffers from audible artifacts and\nmotivates further work. In this work, we seek to learn to remix music directly.\nTo do this, we propose two neural remixing architectures that extend\nConv-TasNet to either remix via a) source estimates directly or b) their latent\nrepresentations. Both methods leverage a remixing data augmentation scheme as\nwell as a mixture reconstruction loss to achieve an end-to-end separation and\nremixing process. We evaluate our methods using the Slakh and MUSDB datasets\nand report both source separation performance and the remixing quality.

Specifically, the learned map is a normalizing\nflow that deforms the support of the reference density to the support of each\nand every density snapshot in time. We demonstrate that this approach can learn\nsolutions to non-local Fokker-Planck equations, such as those arising in\nsystems driven by both Brownian and L\\'evy noise. We present examples with two-\nand three-dimensional, uni- and multimodal distributions to validate the\nmethod.",

To permit\nforecasting of expected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), interference-to-noise\nratio (INR) and probability of outage, we characterize the powers of desired\nand interference signals as received by ground users from such a LEO satellite.\nIn particular, building on the Shadowed Rician channel model, we observe that\nco-cell and cross-cell sky-to-ground signals travel along similar paths,\nwhereas terrestrial co- and cross-cell signals travel along very different\npaths. We characterize SNR, signal-to-interference ratio (SIR), and INR using\ntransmit beam profiles and linear relationships that we establish between\ncertain Shadowed Rician random variables.

Compared with previous\nstudy, our proposed model is robust to noise and able to fuse various imaging\nfeatures and spatiotemporal features of EBUS videos.

Physician can observe the characteristics\nof the lesion using grayscale mode, doppler mode, and elastography during the\nprocedure. To process the EBUS data in the form of a video and appropriately\nintegrate the features of multiple imaging modes, we used a time-series\nthree-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D CNN) to learn the\nspatiotemporal features and design a variety of architectures to fuse each\nimaging mode. Our model (Res3D_UDE) took grayscale mode, Doppler mode, and\nelastography as training data and achieved an accuracy of 82.00% and area under\nthe curve (AUC) of 0.83 on the validation set. Compared with previous study, we\ndirectly used videos recorded during procedure as training and validation data,\nwithout additional manual selection, which might be easier for clinical\napplication. In addition, model designed with 3D CNN can also effectively learn\nspatiotemporal features and improve accuracy.

    "abstract": "Materials' microstructures are signatures of their alloying composition and\nprocessing history. Therefore, microstructures exist in a wide variety. As\nmaterials become increasingly complex to comply with engineering demands,\nadvanced computer vision (CV) approaches such as deep learning (DL) inevitably\ngain relevance for quantifying microstrucutures' constituents from micrographs.\nWhile DL can outperform classical CV techniques for many tasks, shortcomings\nare poor data efficiency and generalizability across datasets. This is\ninherently in conflict with the expense associated with annotating materials\ndata through experts and extensive materials diversity. To tackle poor domain\ngeneralizability and the lack of labeled data simultaneously, we propose to\napply a sub-class of transfer learning methods called unsupervised domain\nadaptation (UDA). These algorithms address the task of finding domain-invariant\nfeatures when supplied with annotated source data and unannotated target data,\nsuch that performance on the latter distribution is optimized despite the\nabsence of annotations. Exemplarily, this study is conducted on a lath-shaped\nbainite segmentation task in complex phase steel micrographs. Here, the domains\nto bridge are selected to be different metallographic specimen preparations\n(surface etchings) and distinct imaging modalities. We show that a\nstate-of-the-art UDA approach surpasses the na\\\"ive application of source\ndomain trained models on the target domain (generalization baseline) to a large\nextent. This holds true independent of the domain shift, despite using little\ndata, and even when the baseline models were pre-trained or employed data\naugmentation. Through UDA, mIoU was improved over generalization baselines from\n82.2%, 61.0%, 49.7% to 84.7%, 67.3%, 73.3% on three target datasets,\nrespectively. This underlines this techniques' potential to cope with materials\nvariance.",

In\nthis paper, we present a collaborative temporal-relational modeling framework\nfor end-to-end stock trend prediction. The temporal dynamics of stocks is\nfirstly captured with an attention-based recurrent neural network. Then,\ndifferent from existing studies relying on the pairwise correlations between\nstocks, we argue that stocks are naturally connected as a collective group, and\nintroduce the hypergraph structures to jointly characterize the stock\ngroup-wise relationships of industry-belonging and fund-holding.

In this manner, HGTAN\nadaptively determines the importance of nodes, hyperedges, and hypergraphs\nduring the information propagation among stocks, so that the potential\nsynergies between stock movements can be fully exploited.

Notwithstanding, in order to prioritize measures for\nimproving service reliability and hence reducing passenger delays, it is\nparamount to identify the system components - stations and track segments -\nwhere most passenger delay occurs. To this end, we propose a novel method for\nestimating network passenger delay from individual trajectories. We decompose\nthe delay along a passenger trajectory into its corresponding track segment\ndelay, initial waiting time and transfer delay. We distinguish between two\ndifferent types of passenger delay in relation to the public transit network:\naverage passenger delay and total passenger delay. We employ temporal\nclustering on these two quantities to reveal daily and seasonal regularity in\ndelay patterns of the transit network. The estimation and clustering methods\nare demonstrated on one year of data from Washington metro network. The data\nconsists of schedule information and smart card data which includes\npassenger-train assignment of the metro network for the months of August 2017\nto August 2018.

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose a beam training codebook for Reconfigurable\nIntelligent Surface (RIS) assisted mmWave uplink communication. Beam training\nprocedure is important to establish a reliable link between user node and\nAccess point (AP). A codebook based training procedure reduces the search time\nto obtain best possible phase shift by RIS controller to align incident beam at\nRIS in the direction of receiving node. We consider a semi passive RIS to\nassist RIS controller with a feedback of minimum overhead. It is shown that the\nprocedure detects a mobile node with high probability in a short interval of\ntime. Further we use the same codebook at user node to know the desired\ndirection of communication via RIS.",

We fit these models by\nderiving functional gradients and implement regularization techniques for more\nparsimonious results.

    "title": "Swap-Free Fat-Water Separation in Dixon MRI using Conditional Generative  Adversarial Networks",
    "abstract": "Dixon MRI is widely used for body composition studies. Current processing\nmethods associated with large whole-body volumes are time intensive and prone\nto artifacts during fat-water separation performed on the scanner, making the\ndata difficult to analyse. The most common artifact are fat-water swaps, where\nthe labels are inverted at the voxel level. It is common for researchers to\ndiscard swapped data (generally around 10%), which can be wasteful and lead to\nunintended biases. The UK Biobank is acquiring Dixon MRI for over 100,000\nparticipants, and thousands of swaps will occur. If those go undetected, errors\nwill propagate into processes such as abdominal organ segmentation and dilute\nthe results in population-based analyses. There is a clear need for a fast and\nrobust method to accurately separate fat and water channels. In this work we\npropose such a method based on style transfer using a conditional generative\nadversarial network. We also introduce a new Dixon loss function for the\ngenerator model. Using data from the UK Biobank Dixon MRI, our model is able to\npredict highly accurate fat and water channels that are free from artifacts. We\nshow that the model separates fat and water channels using either single input\n(in-phase) or dual input (in-phase and opposed-phase), with the latter\nproducing improved results. Our proposed method enables faster and more\naccurate downstream analysis of body composition from Dixon MRI in population\nstudies by eliminating the need for visual inspection or discarding data due to\nfat-water swaps.",

    "title": "Did the Model Change? Efficiently Assessing Machine Learning API Shifts",
    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) prediction APIs are increasingly widely used. An ML API\ncan change over time due to model updates or retraining. This presents a key\nchallenge in the usage of the API because it is often not clear to the user if\nand how the ML model has changed. Model shifts can affect downstream\napplication performance and also create oversight issues (e.g. if consistency\nis desired). In this paper, we initiate a systematic investigation of ML API\nshifts. We first quantify the performance shifts from 2020 to 2021 of popular\nML APIs from Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and others on a variety of datasets. We\nidentified significant model shifts in 12 out of 36 cases we investigated.\nInterestingly, we found several datasets where the API's predictions became\nsignificantly worse over time. This motivated us to formulate the API shift\nassessment problem at a more fine-grained level as estimating how the API\nmodel's confusion matrix changes over time when the data distribution is\nconstant. Monitoring confusion matrix shifts using standard random sampling can\nrequire a large number of samples, which is expensive as each API call costs a\nfee. We propose a principled adaptive sampling algorithm, MASA, to efficiently\nestimate confusion matrix shifts. MASA can accurately estimate the confusion\nmatrix shifts in commercial ML APIs using up to 90% fewer samples compared to\nrandom sampling. This work establishes ML API shifts as an important problem to\nstudy and provides a cost-effective approach to monitor such shifts.",
