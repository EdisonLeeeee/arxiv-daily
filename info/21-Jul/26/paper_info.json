    "abstract": "In this paper we prove that Local (S)GD (or FedAvg) can optimize two-layer\nneural networks with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function in\npolynomial time. Despite the established convergence theory of Local SGD on\noptimizing general smooth functions in communication-efficient distributed\noptimization, its convergence on non-smooth ReLU networks still eludes full\ntheoretical understanding. The key property used in many Local SGD analysis on\nsmooth function is gradient Lipschitzness, so that the gradient on local models\nwill not drift far away from that on averaged model. However, this decent\nproperty does not hold in networks with non-smooth ReLU activation function. We\nshow that, even though ReLU network does not admit gradient Lipschitzness\nproperty, the difference between gradients on local models and average model\nwill not change too much, under the dynamics of Local SGD. We validate our\ntheoretical results via extensive experiments. This work is the first to show\nthe convergence of Local SGD on non-smooth functions, and will shed lights on\nthe optimization theory of federated training of deep neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies show that deep neural networks (DNN) are vulnerable to\nadversarial examples, which aim to mislead DNNs by adding perturbations with\nsmall magnitude. To defend against such attacks, both empirical and theoretical\ndefense approaches have been extensively studied for a single ML model. In this\nwork, we aim to analyze and provide the certified robustness for ensemble ML\nmodels, together with the sufficient and necessary conditions of robustness for\ndifferent ensemble protocols. Although ensemble models are shown more robust\nthan a single model empirically; surprisingly, we find that in terms of the\ncertified robustness the standard ensemble models only achieve marginal\nimprovement compared to a single model. Thus, to explore the conditions that\nguarantee to provide certifiably robust ensemble ML models, we first prove that\ndiversified gradient and large confidence margin are sufficient and necessary\nconditions for certifiably robust ensemble models under the model-smoothness\nassumption. We then provide the bounded model-smoothness analysis based on the\nproposed Ensemble-before-Smoothing strategy. We also prove that an ensemble\nmodel can always achieve higher certified robustness than a single base model\nunder mild conditions. Inspired by the theoretical findings, we propose the\nlightweight Diversity Regularized Training (DRT) to train certifiably robust\nensemble ML models. Extensive experiments show that our DRT enhanced ensembles\ncan consistently achieve higher certified robustness than existing single and\nensemble ML models, demonstrating the state-of-the-art certified L2-robustness\non MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet datasets.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) provides a regression framework for\nadaptively learning a best-fit linear dynamics model over snapshots of\ntemporal, or spatio-temporal, data. A diversity of regression techniques have\nbeen developed for producing the linear model approximation whose solutions are\nexponentials in time. For spatio-temporal data, DMD provides low-rank and\ninterpretable models in the form of dominant modal structures along with their\nexponential/oscillatory behavior in time. The majority of DMD algorithms,\nhowever, are prone to bias errors from noisy measurements of the dynamics,\nleading to poor model fits and unstable forecasting capabilities. The optimized\nDMD algorithm minimizes the model bias with a variable projection optimization,\nthus leading to stabilized forecasting capabilities. Here, the optimized DMD\nalgorithm is improved by using statistical bagging methods whereby a single set\nof snapshots is used to produce an ensemble of optimized DMD models. The\noutputs of these models are averaged to produce a bagging, optimized dynamic\nmode decomposition (BOP-DMD). BOP-DMD not only improves performance, it also\nrobustifies the model and provides both spatial and temporal uncertainty\nquantification (UQ). Thus unlike currently available DMD algorithms, BOP-DMD\nprovides a stable and robust model for probabilistic, or Bayesian forecasting\nwith comprehensive UQ metrics.",

This discussion aims at analyzing the\nstate of the art of current available Layer II solutions to overcome these\nlimitations, both focusing on theoretical and practical aspects and\nhighlighting the main differences among the examined frameworks. The structure\nof the work is based on three major sections. In particular, the first one is\nan introductory part about the technology, the scalability issue and Layer II\nas a solution. The second section represents the core of the discussion and\nconsists of three different subsections, each with a detailed examination of\nthe respective solution (Lightning Network, Plasma, Rollups); the analysis of\neach solution is based on how it affects five key aspects of blockchain\ntechnology and Layer II: scalability, security, decentralization, privacy, fees\nand micropayments (the last two are analyzed together given their high\ncorrelation). Finally, the third section includes a tabular summary, followed\nby a detailed description of a use-case specifically thought for a practical\nevaluation of the presented frameworks. The results of the work met\nexpectations: all solutions effectively contribute to increasing scalability.

    "abstract": "The 3D reconstruction of objects is a prerequisite for many highly relevant\napplications of computer vision such as mobile robotics or autonomous driving.\nTo deal with the inverse problem of reconstructing 3D objects from their 2D\nprojections, a common strategy is to incorporate prior object knowledge into\nthe reconstruction approach by establishing a 3D model and aligning it to the\n2D image plane. However, current approaches are limited due to inadequate shape\npriors and the insufficiency of the derived image observations for a reliable\nalignment with the 3D model. The goal of this paper is to show how 3D object\nreconstruction can profit from a more sophisticated shape prior and from a\ncombined incorporation of different observation types inferred from the images.\nWe introduce a subcategory-aware deformable vehicle model that makes use of a\nprediction of the vehicle type for a more appropriate regularisation of the\nvehicle shape. A multi-branch CNN is presented to derive predictions of the\nvehicle type and orientation. This information is also introduced as prior\ninformation for model fitting. Furthermore, the CNN extracts vehicle keypoints\nand wireframes, which are well-suited for model-to-image association and model\nfitting. The task of pose estimation and reconstruction is addressed by a\nversatile probabilistic model. Extensive experiments are conducted using two\nchallenging real-world data sets on both of which the benefit of the developed\nshape prior can be shown. A comparison to state-of-the-art methods for vehicle\npose estimation shows that the proposed approach performs on par or better,\nconfirming the suitability of the developed shape prior and probabilistic model\nfor vehicle reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose a domain generalization (DG) approach to learn on\nseveral labeled source domains and transfer knowledge to a target domain that\nis inaccessible in training. Considering the inherent conditional and label\nshifts, we would expect the alignment of $p(x|y)$ and $p(y)$. However, the\nwidely used domain invariant feature learning (IFL) methods relies on aligning\nthe marginal concept shift w.r.t. $p(x)$, which rests on an unrealistic\nassumption that $p(y)$ is invariant across domains. We thereby propose a novel\nvariational Bayesian inference framework to enforce the conditional\ndistribution alignment w.r.t. $p(x|y)$ via the prior distribution matching in a\nlatent space, which also takes the marginal label shift w.r.t. $p(y)$ into\nconsideration with the posterior alignment. Extensive experiments on various\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our framework is robust to the label shift and the\ncross-domain accuracy is significantly improved, thereby achieving superior\nperformance over the conventional IFL counterparts.",

    "abstract": "In boundary element methods (BEM) in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, matrix elements and\nright hand sides are typically computed via integration over line, triangle and\ntetrahedral volume elements. When the problem size gets large, the resulting\nlinear systems are often solved iteratively via Krylov methods, with fast\nmultipole methods (FMM) used to accelerate the matrix vector products needed.\nThe integrals are often computed via numerical or analytical quadrature. When\nFMM acceleration is used, most entries of the matrix never need be computed\nexplicitly - they are only needed in terms of their contribution to the\nmultipole expansion coefficients. Furthermore, the two parts of this resulting\nalgorithm - the integration and the FMM matrix vector product - are both\napproximate, and their errors have to be matched to avoid wasteful\ncomputations, or poorly controlled error. We propose a new fast method for\ngeneration of multipole expansion coefficients for the fields produced by the\nintegration of the single and double layer potentials on surface triangles;\ncharge distributions over line segments; and regular functions over tetrahedra\nin the volume; so that the overall method is well integrated into the FMM, with\ncontrolled error. The method is based on recursive computations of the\nmultipole moments for $O(1)$ cost per moment with a low asymptotic constant.\nThe method is developed for the Laplace Green's function in ${\\mathbb R}^3$.\nThe derived recursions are tested both for accuracy and performance.",

However, large scale\nconstruction of HD maps is limited by tedious human labeling and high\nmaintenance costs, especially for urban scenarios with complicated road\nstructures and irregular markings. This paper proposes an approach based on\nsemantic-particle filter to tackle the automatic lane-level mapping problem in\nurban scenes. The map skeleton is firstly structured as a directed cyclic graph\nfrom online mapping database OpenStreetMap. Our proposed method then performs\nsemantic segmentation on 2D front-view images from ego vehicles and explores\nthe lane semantics on a birds-eye-view domain with true topographical\nprojection. Exploiting OpenStreetMap, we further infer lane topology and\nreference trajectory at intersections with the aforementioned lane semantics.\nThe proposed algorithm has been tested in densely urbanized areas, and the\nresults demonstrate accurate and robust reconstruction of the lane-level HD\nmap.",

    "abstract": "In the past few decades, machine learning has revolutionized data processing\nfor large scale applications. Simultaneously, increasing privacy threats in\ntrending applications led to the redesign of classical data training models. In\nparticular, classical machine learning involves centralized data training,\nwhere the data is gathered, and the entire training process executes at the\ncentral server. Despite significant convergence, this training involves several\nprivacy threats on participants' data when shared with the central cloud\nserver. To this end, federated learning has achieved significant importance\nover distributed data training. In particular, the federated learning allows\nparticipants to collaboratively train the local models on local data without\nrevealing their sensitive information to the central cloud server. In this\npaper, we perform a convergence comparison between classical machine learning\nand federated learning on two publicly available datasets, namely,\nlogistic-regression-MNIST dataset and image-classification-CIFAR-10 dataset.\nThe simulation results demonstrate that federated learning achieves higher\nconvergence within limited communication rounds while maintaining participants'\nanonymity. We hope that this research will show the benefits and help federated\nlearning to be implemented widely.",

    "abstract": "AI-based methods have been widely applied to tourism demand forecasting.\nHowever, current AI-based methods are short of the ability to process long-term\ndependency, and most of them lack interpretability. The Transformer used\ninitially for machine translation shows an incredible ability to long-term\ndependency processing. Based on the Transformer, we proposed a time series\nTransformer (Tsformer) with Encoder-Decoder architecture for tourism demand\nforecasting. The proposed Tsformer encodes long-term dependency with encoder,\ncaptures short-term dependency with decoder, and simplifies the attention\ninteractions under the premise of highlighting dominant attention through a\nseries of attention masking mechanisms. These improvements make the multi-head\nattention mechanism process the input sequence according to the time\nrelationship, contributing to better interpretability. What's more, the context\nprocessing ability of the Encoder-Decoder architecture allows adopting the\ncalendar of days to be forecasted to enhance the forecasting performance.\nExperiments conducted on the Jiuzhaigou valley and Siguniang mountain tourism\ndemand datasets with other nine baseline methods indicate that the proposed\nTsformer outperformed all baseline models in the short-term and long-term\ntourism demand forecasting tasks. Moreover, ablation studies demonstrate that\nthe adoption of the calendar of days to be forecasted contributes to the\nforecasting performance of the proposed Tsformer. For better interpretability,\nthe attention weight matrix visualization is performed. It indicates that the\nTsformer concentrates on seasonal features and days close to days to be\nforecast in short-term forecasting.",

    "abstract": "The developers of Ethereum smart contracts often implement administrating\npatterns, such as censoring certain users, creating or destroying balances on\ndemand, destroying smart contracts, or injecting arbitrary code. These routines\nturn an ERC20 token into an administrated token - the type of Ethereum smart\ncontract that we scrutinize in this research. We discover that many smart\ncontracts are administrated, and the owners of these tokens carry lesser social\nand legal responsibilities compared to the traditional centralized actors that\nthose tokens intend to disrupt. This entails two major problems: a) the owners\nof the tokens have the ability to quickly steal all the funds and disappear\nfrom the market; and b) if the private key of the owner's account is stolen,\nall the assets might immediately turn into the property of the attacker. We\ndevelop a pattern recognition framework based on 9 syntactic features\ncharacterizing administrated ERC20 tokens, which we use to analyze existing\nsmart contracts deployed on Ethereum Mainnet. Our analysis of 84,062 unique\nEthereum smart contracts reveals that nearly 58% of them are administrated\nERC20 tokens, which accounts for almost 90% of all ERC20 tokens deployed on\nEthereum. To protect users from the frivolousness of unregulated token owners\nwithout depriving the ability of these owners to properly manage their tokens,\nwe introduce SafelyAdministrated - a library that enforces a responsible\nownership and management of ERC20 tokens. The library introduces three\nmechanisms: deferred maintenance, board of trustees and safe pause. We\nimplement and test SafelyAdministrated in the form of Solidity abstract\ncontract, which is ready to be used by the next generation of safely\nadministrated ERC20 tokens.",

The\ndistribution of a noisy point cloud can be viewed as the distribution of a set\nof noise-free samples $p(x)$ convolved with some noise model $n$, leading to\n$(p * n)(x)$ whose mode is the underlying clean surface. To denoise a noisy\npoint cloud, we propose to increase the log-likelihood of each point from $p *\nn$ via gradient ascent -- iteratively updating each point's position. Since $p\n* n$ is unknown at test-time, and we only need the score (i.e., the gradient of\nthe log-probability function) to perform gradient ascent, we propose a neural\nnetwork architecture to estimate the score of $p * n$ given only noisy point\nclouds as input. We derive objective functions for training the network and\ndevelop a denoising algorithm leveraging on the estimated scores.

However,\nmost existing approaches explicitly leverage the pose information extracted\nfrom the source images as a conditional input for the generative networks.\nMeanwhile, they usually focus on the visual fidelity of the synthesized images\nbut neglect the inherent consistency, which further confines their performance\nof pose transfer. To alleviate the current limitations and improve the quality\nof the synthesized images, we propose a pose transfer network with Disentangled\nFeature Consistency (DFC-Net) to facilitate human pose transfer. Given a pair\nof images containing the source and target person, DFC-Net extracts pose and\nstatic information from the source and target respectively, then synthesizes an\nimage of the target person with the desired pose from the source. Moreover,\nDFC-Net leverages disentangled feature consistency losses in the adversarial\ntraining to strengthen the transfer coherence and integrates the keypoint\namplifier to enhance the pose feature extraction. Additionally, an unpaired\nsupport dataset Mixamo-Sup providing more extra pose information has been\nfurther utilized during the training to improve the generality and robustness\nof DFC-Net. Extensive experimental results on Mixamo-Pose and EDN-10k have\ndemonstrated DFC-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on pose transfer.",

The symmetry\nrestriction is that the circuits which take a matrix input are unchanged by a\npermutation applied simultaneously to the rows and columns of the matrix. Under\nsuch restrictions we have polynomial-size circuits for computing the\ndeterminant but no subexponential size circuits for the permanent. Here, we\nconsider a more stringent symmetry requirement, namely that the circuits are\nunchanged by arbitrary even permutations applied separately to rows and\ncolumns, and prove an exponential lower bound even for circuits computing the\ndeterminant. The result requires substantial new machinery. We develop a\ngeneral framework for proving lower bounds for symmetric circuits with\nrestricted symmetries, based on a new support theorem and new two-player\nrestricted bijection games. These are applied to the determinant problem with a\nnovel construction of matrices that are bi-adjacency matrices of graphs based\non the CFI construction.

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) techniques have achieved great success in predictive\naccuracy in a variety of tasks, but deep neural networks (DNNs) are shown to\nproduce highly overconfident scores for even abnormal samples. Well-defined\nuncertainty indicates whether a model's output should (or should not) be\ntrusted and thus becomes critical in real-world scenarios which typically\ninvolves shifted input distributions due to many factors. Existing uncertainty\napproaches assume that testing samples from a different data distribution would\ninduce unreliable model predictions thus have higher uncertainty scores. They\nquantify model uncertainty by calibrating DL model's confidence of a given\ninput and evaluate the effectiveness in computer vision (CV) and natural\nlanguage processing (NLP)-related tasks. However, their methodologies'\nreliability may be compromised under programming tasks due to difference in\ndata representations and shift patterns. In this paper, we first define three\ndifferent types of distribution shift in program data and build a large-scale\nshifted Java dataset. We implement two common programming language tasks on our\ndataset to study the effect of each distribution shift on DL model performance.\nWe also propose a large-scale benchmark of existing state-of-the-art predictive\nuncertainty on programming tasks and investigate their effectiveness under data\ndistribution shift. Experiments show that program distribution shift does\ndegrade the DL model performance to varying degrees and that existing\nuncertainty methods all present certain limitations in quantifying uncertainty\non program dataset.",

Although some works have been proposed\nto improve the training efficiency of PINNs, few consider the influence of\ninitialization. To this end, we propose a New Reptile initialization based\nPhysics-Informed Neural Network (NRPINN). The original Reptile algorithm is a\nmeta-learning initialization method based on labeled data. PINNs can be trained\nwith less labeled data or even without any labeled data by adding partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs) as a penalty term into the loss function.\nInspired by this idea, we propose the new Reptile initialization to sample more\ntasks from the parameterized PDEs and adapt the penalty term of the loss. The\nnew Reptile initialization can acquire initialization parameters from related\ntasks by supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning. Then, PINNs\nwith initialization parameters can efficiently solve PDEs. Besides, the new\nReptile initialization can also be used for the variants of PINNs. Finally, we\ndemonstrate and verify the NRPINN considering both forward problems, including\nsolving Poisson, Burgers, and Schr\\\"odinger equations, as well as inverse\nproblems, where unknown parameters in the PDEs are estimated.

Unlike earlier approaches, which either rely on extraction\nof explicit feature descriptors and their classification, or fine-tuning\ngeneral scene parsing deep networks for sky segmentation, our approach learns\nlinear filters based on local structure analysis. At test time, for every\ncandidate edge pixel, a single filter is chosen from the set of learned filters\nbased on pixel's structure tensor, and then applied to the patch around it. We\nthen employ dynamic programming to solve the shortest path problem for the\nresultant multistage graph to get the sky-mountain boundary.

    "title": "Model Selection for Offline Reinforcement Learning: Practical  Considerations for Healthcare Settings",
    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to learn treatment policies and aid\ndecision making in healthcare. However, given the need for generalization over\ncomplex state/action spaces, the incorporation of function approximators (e.g.,\ndeep neural networks) requires model selection to reduce overfitting and\nimprove policy performance at deployment. Yet a standard validation pipeline\nfor model selection requires running a learned policy in the actual\nenvironment, which is often infeasible in a healthcare setting. In this work,\nwe investigate a model selection pipeline for offline RL that relies on\noff-policy evaluation (OPE) as a proxy for validation performance. We present\nan in-depth analysis of popular OPE methods, highlighting the additional\nhyperparameters and computational requirements (fitting/inference of auxiliary\nmodels) when used to rank a set of candidate policies. We compare the utility\nof different OPE methods as part of the model selection pipeline in the context\nof learning to treat patients with sepsis. Among all the OPE methods we\nconsidered, fitted Q evaluation (FQE) consistently leads to the best validation\nranking, but at a high computational cost. To balance this trade-off between\naccuracy of ranking and computational efficiency, we propose a simple two-stage\napproach to accelerate model selection by avoiding potentially unnecessary\ncomputation. Our work serves as a practical guide for offline RL model\nselection and can help RL practitioners select policies using real-world\ndatasets. To facilitate reproducibility and future extensions, the code\naccompanying this paper is available online at\nhttps://github.com/MLD3/OfflineRL_ModelSelection.",

    "abstract": "Video semantic segmentation is an essential task for the analysis and\nunderstanding of videos. Recent efforts largely focus on supervised video\nsegmentation by learning from fully annotated data, but the learnt models often\nexperience clear performance drop while applied to videos of a different\ndomain. This paper presents DA-VSN, a domain adaptive video segmentation\nnetwork that addresses domain gaps in videos by temporal consistency\nregularization (TCR) for consecutive frames of target-domain videos. DA-VSN\nconsists of two novel and complementary designs. The first is cross-domain TCR\nthat guides the prediction of target frames to have similar temporal\nconsistency as that of source frames (learnt from annotated source data) via\nadversarial learning. The second is intra-domain TCR that guides unconfident\npredictions of target frames to have similar temporal consistency as confident\npredictions of target frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority\nof our proposed domain adaptive video segmentation network which outperforms\nmultiple baselines consistently by large margins.",

    "abstract": "Transparent objects are a very challenging problem in computer vision. They\nare hard to segment or classify due to their lack of precise boundaries, and\nthere is limited data available for training deep neural networks. As such,\ncurrent solutions for this problem employ rigid synthetic datasets, which lack\nflexibility and lead to severe performance degradation when deployed on\nreal-world scenarios. In particular, these synthetic datasets omit features\nsuch as refraction, dispersion and caustics due to limitations in the rendering\npipeline. To address this issue, we present SuperCaustics, a real-time,\nopen-source simulation of transparent objects designed for deep learning\napplications. SuperCaustics features extensive modules for stochastic\nenvironment creation; uses hardware ray-tracing to support caustics,\ndispersion, and refraction; and enables generating massive datasets with\nmulti-modal, pixel-perfect ground truth annotations. To validate our proposed\nsystem, we trained a deep neural network from scratch to segment transparent\nobjects in difficult lighting scenarios. Our neural network achieved\nperformance comparable to the state-of-the-art on a real-world dataset using\nonly 10% of the training data and in a fraction of the training time. Further\nexperiments show that a model trained with SuperCaustics can segment different\ntypes of caustics, even in images with multiple overlapping transparent\nobjects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such result for a\nmodel trained on synthetic data. Both our open-source code and experimental\ndata are freely available online.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted\nInternet-of-Things (IoT) system in a sophisticated three-dimensional (3D)\nenvironment, where the UAV's trajectory is optimized to efficiently collect\ndata from multiple IoT ground nodes. Unlike existing approaches focusing only\non a simplified two-dimensional scenario and the availability of perfect\nchannel state information (CSI), this paper considers a practical 3D urban\nenvironment with imperfect CSI, where the UAV's trajectory is designed to\nminimize data collection completion time subject to practical throughput and\nflight movement constraints. Specifically, inspired from the state-of-the-art\ndeep reinforcement learning approaches, we leverage the twin-delayed deep\ndeterministic policy gradient (TD3) to design the UAV's trajectory and present\na TD3-based trajectory design for completion time minimization (TD3-TDCTM)\nalgorithm. In particular, we set an additional information, i.e., the merged\npheromone, to represent the state information of UAV and environment as a\nreference of reward which facilitates the algorithm design. By taking the\nservice statuses of IoT nodes, the UAV's position, and the merged pheromone as\ninput, the proposed algorithm can continuously and adaptively learn how to\nadjust the UAV's movement strategy. By interacting with the external\nenvironment in the corresponding Markov decision process, the proposed\nalgorithm can achieve a near-optimal navigation strategy. Our simulation\nresults show the superiority of the proposed TD3-TDCTM algorithm over three\nconventional non-learning based baseline methods.",

This paper develops a new shape model that allows synthesizing novel\ndistance views by optimizing a continuous signed directional distance function\n(SDDF). Similar to deep SDF models, our SDDF formulation can represent whole\ncategories of shapes and complete or interpolate across shapes from partial\ninput data. Unlike an SDF, which measures distance to the nearest surface in\nany direction, an SDDF measures distance in a given direction. This allows\ntraining an SDDF model without 3D shape supervision, using only distance\nmeasurements, readily available from depth camera or Lidar sensors. Our model\nalso removes post-processing steps like surface extraction or rendering by\ndirectly predicting distance at arbitrary locations and viewing directions.\nUnlike deep view-synthesis techniques, such as Neural Radiance Fields, which\ntrain high-capacity black-box models, our model encodes by construction the\nproperty that SDDF values decrease linearly along the viewing direction.

    "abstract": "Image inpainting aims to complete the missing or corrupted regions of images\nwith realistic contents. The prevalent approaches adopt a hybrid objective of\nreconstruction and perceptual quality by using generative adversarial networks.\nHowever, the reconstruction loss and adversarial loss focus on synthesizing\ncontents of different frequencies and simply applying them together often leads\nto inter-frequency conflicts and compromised inpainting. This paper presents\nWaveFill, a wavelet-based inpainting network that decomposes images into\nmultiple frequency bands and fills the missing regions in each frequency band\nseparately and explicitly. WaveFill decomposes images by using discrete wavelet\ntransform (DWT) that preserves spatial information naturally. It applies L1\nreconstruction loss to the decomposed low-frequency bands and adversarial loss\nto high-frequency bands, hence effectively mitigate inter-frequency conflicts\nwhile completing images in spatial domain. To address the inpainting\ninconsistency in different frequency bands and fuse features with distinct\nstatistics, we design a novel normalization scheme that aligns and fuses the\nmulti-frequency features effectively. Extensive experiments over multiple\ndatasets show that WaveFill achieves superior image inpainting qualitatively\nand quantitatively.",

In this study, we propose a hybrid vehicle\nplatoon system for the connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). First, a hybrid\nspacing policy combining the constant time gap (CTG) and constant spacing (CS)\nis formulated for the proposed platoon system, where the leader adopts the CTG\nand the followers use the CS policy. Based on the h2-norm string stability\ncriteria, the notions of exogenous-head-to-tail string stability and hybrid\nstring stability are newly introduced, and the sufficient conditions of the\nhybrid string stability in the frequency domain are derived using the Laplace\ntransform. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the hybrid string\nstability. Moreover, two typical scenarios and several measurements of\neffectiveness (MOE) are adopted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed\nhybrid platoon system in various aspects. The results show that the hybrid\nplatoon system performs better than the CS-based platoon system. It also\nindicates that the hybrid platoon system has obvious advantages over the\nCTG-based platoon system under the periodical fluctuation scenario and it is\nalso comparable to the CTG-based platoon system under the large deceleration\nand acceleration scenario. The findings have demonstrated the merits of the\ncombined implementation of CTG and CS policy in enhancing the performance and\napplicability of the platoon system for CAVs.",

    "abstract": "Due to the unstable nature of minimax game between generator and\ndiscriminator, improving the performance of GANs is a challenging task. Recent\nstudies have shown that selected high-quality samples in training improve the\nperformance of GANs. However, sampling approaches which discard samples show\nlimitations in some aspects such as the speed of training and optimality of the\nnetworks. In this paper we propose unrealistic feature suppression (UFS) module\nthat keeps high-quality features and suppresses unrealistic features. UFS\nmodule keeps the training stability of networks and improves the quality of\ngenerated images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of UFS module on various\nmodels such as WGAN-GP, SNGAN, and BigGAN. By using UFS module, we achieved\nbetter Frechet inception distance and inception score compared to various\nbaseline models. We also visualize how effectively our UFS module suppresses\nunrealistic features through class activation maps.",

In this regard, we\npropose a novel method to leverage the classifier discrepancies for the\nacquisition function for active learning.

    "abstract": "Existing Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) literature adopts the covariate\nshift and conditional shift assumptions, which essentially encourage models to\nlearn common features across domains. However, due to the lack of supervision\nin the target domain, they suffer from the semantic loss: the feature will\ninevitably lose non-discriminative semantics in source domain, which is however\ndiscriminative in target domain. We use a causal view -- transportability\ntheory -- to identify that such loss is in fact a confounding effect, which can\nonly be removed by causal intervention. However, the theoretical solution\nprovided by transportability is far from practical for UDA, because it requires\nthe stratification and representation of an unobserved confounder that is the\ncause of the domain gap. To this end, we propose a practical solution:\nTransporting Causal Mechanisms (TCM), to identify the confounder stratum and\nrepresentations by using the domain-invariant disentangled causal mechanisms,\nwhich are discovered in an unsupervised fashion. Our TCM is both theoretically\nand empirically grounded. Extensive experiments show that TCM achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on three challenging UDA benchmarks: ImageCLEF-DA,\nOffice-Home, and VisDA-2017. Codes are available in Appendix.",

    "abstract": "This article proposes a coupled thermomechanical finite element model\ntailored to the part-scale simulation of metal additive manufacturing processes\nsuch as selective laser melting. A first focus lies on the derivation of a\nconsistent constitutive law on basis of a Voigt-type spatial homogenization\nprocedure across the relevant phases, powder, melt and solid. The proposed\nconstitutive law accounts for the irreversibility of phase change and\nconsistently represents thermally induced residual stresses. In particular, the\nincorporation of a reference strain term, formulated in rate form, allows to\nconsistently enforce a stress-free configuration for newly solidifying material\nat melt temperature. Application to elementary test cases demonstrates the\nvalidity of the proposed constitutive law and allows for a comparison with\nanalytical and reference solutions. Moreover, these elementary solidification\nscenarios give detailed insights and foster understanding of basic mechanisms\nof residual stress generation in melting and solidification problems with\nlocalized, moving heat sources. As a second methodological aspect, mortar\nmeshtying strategies are proposed for the coupling of successively applied\npowder layers. This approach allows for very flexible mesh generation for\ncomplex geometries. As compared to collocation-type coupling schemes, e.g.,\nbased on hanging nodes, these mortar methods enforce the coupling conditions\nbetween non-matching meshes in an $L^2$-optimal manner. The combination of the\nproposed constitutive law and mortar meshtying approach is validated on\nthree-dimensional examples with rather complex geometry, representing a first\nstep towards part-scale predictions.",

CBS smoothes the features embedding\nusing anti-aliasing and helps the model to learn domain invariant features. We\nalso adopt label smoothing (LS) to calibrate prediction probability and obtain\nbetter feature representation with both feature extractor and captioning model.\nThe proposed techniques are empirically evaluated by using the datasets of two\nsurgical domains, such as nephrectomy operations and transoral robotic surgery.\nWe observe that domain invariant feature learning and the well-calibrated\nnetwork improves the surgical report generation performance in both source and\ntarget domain under domain shift and unseen classes in the manners of one-shot\nand few-shot learning.

    "abstract": "Sepsis is a life-threatening disease with high morbidity, mortality and\nhealthcare costs. The early prediction and administration of antibiotics and\nintravenous fluids is considered crucial for the treatment of sepsis and can\nsave potentially millions of lives and billions in health care costs.\nProfessional clinical care practitioners have proposed clinical criterion which\naid in early detection of sepsis; however, performance of these criterion is\noften limited. Clinical text provides essential information to estimate the\nseverity of the sepsis in addition to structured clinical data. In this study,\nwe explore how clinical text can complement structured data towards early\nsepsis prediction task. In this paper, we propose multi modal model which\nincorporates both structured data in the form of patient measurements as well\nas textual notes on the patient. We employ state-of-the-art NLP models such as\nBERT and a highly specialized NLP model in Amazon Comprehend Medical to\nrepresent the text. On the MIMIC-III dataset containing records of ICU\nadmissions, we show that by using these notes, one achieves an improvement of\n6.07 points in a standard utility score for Sepsis prediction and 2.89% in\nAUROC score. Our methods significantly outperforms a clinical criteria\nsuggested by experts, qSOFA, as well as the winning model of the PhysioNet\nComputing in Cardiology Challenge for predicting Sepsis.",

    "abstract": "As one of the most fundamental problems in machine learning, statistics and\ndifferential privacy, Differentially Private Stochastic Convex Optimization\n(DP-SCO) has been extensively studied in recent years. However, most of the\nprevious work can only handle either regular data distribution or irregular\ndata in the low dimensional space case. To better understand the challenges\narising from irregular data distribution, in this paper we provide the first\nstudy on the problem of DP-SCO with heavy-tailed data in the high dimensional\nspace. In the first part we focus on the problem over some polytope constraint\n(such as the $\\ell_1$-norm ball). We show that if the loss function is smooth\nand its gradient has bounded second order moment, it is possible to get a (high\nprobability) error bound (excess population risk) of $\\tilde{O}(\\frac{\\log\nd}{(n\\epsilon)^\\frac{1}{3}})$ in the $\\epsilon$-DP model, where $n$ is the\nsample size and $d$ is the dimensionality of the underlying space. Next, for\nLASSO, if the data distribution that has bounded fourth-order moments, we\nimprove the bound to $\\tilde{O}(\\frac{\\log d}{(n\\epsilon)^\\frac{2}{5}})$ in the\n$(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP model. In the second part of the paper, we study sparse\nlearning with heavy-tailed data. We first revisit the sparse linear model and\npropose a truncated DP-IHT method whose output could achieve an error of\n$\\tilde{O}(\\frac{s^{*2}\\log d}{n\\epsilon})$, where $s^*$ is the sparsity of the\nunderlying parameter. Then we study a more general problem over the sparsity\n({\\em i.e.,} $\\ell_0$-norm) constraint, and show that it is possible to achieve\nan error of $\\tilde{O}(\\frac{s^{*\\frac{3}{2}}\\log d}{n\\epsilon})$, which is\nalso near optimal up to a factor of $\\tilde{O}{(\\sqrt{s^*})}$, if the loss\nfunction is smooth and strongly convex.",

A reason for such high performance is the\nset of optimizations introduced in the protocol. One of these optimizations is\nread-only requests, a particular type of client request which avoids running\nthe three-step agreement protocol and allows replicas to respond directly, thus\nreducing the latency of reads from five to two communication steps. Given\nPBFT's broad influence, its design and optimizations influenced many BFT\nprotocols and systems that followed, e.g., BFT-SMaRt. We show, for the first\ntime, that the read-only request optimization introduced in PBFT more than 20\nyears ago can violate its liveness. Notably, the problem affects not only the\noptimized read-only operations but also standard, totally-ordered operations.\nWe show this weakness by presenting an attack in which a malicious leader\nblocks correct clients and present two solutions for patching the protocol,\nmaking read-only operations fast and correct. The two solutions were\nimplemented on BFT-SMaRt and evaluated in different scenarios, showing their\neffectiveness in preventing the identified attack.",

Since\nBoltzmann continua exhibit no inherent rotational degrees of freedom, suitable\ndefinitions of orthonormal triads are investigated that are representative for\nthe orientation of material directions in the 3D solid. The rotation tensor\ndefined by the polar decomposition of the deformation gradient is demonstrated\nto represent these material directions in a L2-optimal manner.

    "abstract": "Multi-label recognition is a fundamental, and yet is a challenging task in\ncomputer vision. Recently, deep learning models have achieved great progress\ntowards learning discriminative features from input images. However,\nconventional approaches are unable to model the inter-class discrepancies among\nfeatures in multi-label images, since they are designed to work for image-level\nfeature discrimination. In this paper, we propose a unified deep network to\nlearn discriminative features for the multi-label task. Given a multi-label\nimage, the proposed method first disentangles features corresponding to\ndifferent classes. Then, it discriminates between these classes via increasing\nthe inter-class distance while decreasing the intra-class differences in the\noutput space. By regularizing the whole network with the proposed loss, the\nperformance of applying the wellknown ResNet-101 is improved significantly.\nExtensive experiments have been performed on COCO-2014, VOC2007 and VOC2012\ndatasets, which demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art approaches by a significant margin of 3:5% on large-scale COCO\ndataset. Moreover, analysis of the discriminative feature learning approach\nshows that it can be plugged into various types of multi-label methods as a\ngeneral module.",

To address this\nchallenge, we propose a novel distributed sampling-based planning algorithm\nthat can significantly increase robot and target scalability while decreasing\ncomputational cost. In our non-myopic approach, all robots build in parallel\nlocal trees exploring the information space and their corresponding motion\nspace. As the robots construct their respective local trees, they communicate\nwith their neighbors to exchange and aggregate their local beliefs about the\nhidden state through a distributed Kalman filter.

The number of active smartphone users is expected to grow, stressing the\nimportance of research on the detection of mobile malware. Detection methods\nfor mobile malware exist but are still limited.\nIn this paper, we provide an overview of the performance of machine learning\n(ML) techniques to detect malware on Android, without using privileged access.\nThe ML-classifiers use device information such as the CPU usage, battery usage,\nand memory usage for the detection of 10 subtypes of Mobile Trojans on the\nAndroid Operating System (OS).\nWe use a real-life dataset containing device and malware data from 47 users\nfor a year (2016).

    "abstract": "Compact convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have witnessed exceptional\nimprovements in performance in recent years. However, they still fail to\nprovide the same predictive power as CNNs with a large number of parameters.\nThe diverse and even abundant features captured by the layers is an important\ncharacteristic of these successful CNNs. However, differences in this\ncharacteristic between large CNNs and their compact counterparts have rarely\nbeen investigated. In compact CNNs, due to the limited number of parameters,\nabundant features are unlikely to be obtained, and feature diversity becomes an\nessential characteristic. Diverse features present in the activation maps\nderived from a data point during model inference may indicate the presence of a\nset of unique descriptors necessary to distinguish between objects of different\nclasses. In contrast, data points with low feature diversity may not provide a\nsufficient amount of unique descriptors to make a valid prediction; we refer to\nthem as random predictions. Random predictions can negatively impact the\noptimization process and harm the final performance. This paper proposes\naddressing the problem raised by random predictions by reshaping the standard\ncross-entropy to make it biased toward data points with a limited number of\nunique descriptive features. Our novel Bias Loss focuses the training on a set\nof valuable data points and prevents the vast number of samples with poor\nlearning features from misleading the optimization process. Furthermore, to\nshow the importance of diversity, we present a family of SkipNet models whose\narchitectures are brought to boost the number of unique descriptors in the last\nlayers.

    "abstract": "We propose a novel method for solving regression tasks using few-shot or weak\nsupervision. At the core of our method is the fundamental observation that GANs\nare incredibly successful at encoding semantic information within their latent\nspace, even in a completely unsupervised setting. For modern generative\nframeworks, this semantic encoding manifests as smooth, linear directions which\naffect image attributes in a disentangled manner. These directions have been\nwidely used in GAN-based image editing. We show that such directions are not\nonly linear, but that the magnitude of change induced on the respective\nattribute is approximately linear with respect to the distance traveled along\nthem. By leveraging this observation, our method turns a pre-trained GAN into a\nregression model, using as few as two labeled samples. This enables solving\nregression tasks on datasets and attributes which are difficult to produce\nquality supervision for. Additionally, we show that the same latent-distances\ncan be used to sort collections of images by the strength of given attributes,\neven in the absence of explicit supervision. Extensive experimental evaluations\ndemonstrate that our method can be applied across a wide range of domains,\nleverage multiple latent direction discovery frameworks, and achieve\nstate-of-the-art results in few-shot and low-supervision settings, even when\ncompared to methods designed to tackle a single task.",

    "abstract": "The combined use of multiple modalities enables accurate pedestrian detection\nunder poor lighting conditions by using the high visibility areas from these\nmodalities together. The vital assumption for the combination use is that there\nis no or only a weak misalignment between the two modalities. In general,\nhowever, this assumption often breaks in actual situations. Due to this\nassumption's breakdown, the position of the bounding boxes does not match\nbetween the two modalities, resulting in a significant decrease in detection\naccuracy, especially in regions where the amount of misalignment is large. In\nthis paper, we propose a multi-modal Faster-RCNN that is robust against large\nmisalignment. The keys are 1) modal-wise regression and 2) multi-modal IoU for\nmini-batch sampling. To deal with large misalignment, we perform bounding box\nregression for both the RPN and detection-head with both modalities. We also\npropose a new sampling strategy called \"multi-modal mini-batch sampling\" that\nintegrates the IoU for both modalities. We demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod's performance is much better than that of the state-of-the-art methods\nfor data with large misalignment through actual image experiments.",

In this paper, we connect the tools\nfrom cryptology and complexity theory in the domain of Boolean functions with\nlow polynomial degree and high sensitivity. It is well known that the\npolynomial degree of of a Boolean function and its resiliency are directly\nconnected. Using this connection we analyze the polynomial degree-sensitivity\nvalues through the lens of resiliency, demonstrating existence and\nnon-existence results of functions with low polynomial degree and high\nsensitivity on small number of variables (upto 10). In this process, borrowing\nan idea from complexity theory, we show that one can implement resilient\nBoolean functions on a large number of variables with linear size and\nlogarithmic depth. Finally, we extend the notion of sensitivity to higher order\nand note that the existing construction idea of Nisan and Szegedy (1994) can\nprovide only constant higher order sensitivity when aiming for polynomial\ndegree of $n-\\omega(1)$. In this direction, we present a construction with low\n($n-\\omega(1)$) polynomial degree and super-constant $\\omega(1)$ order\nsensitivity exploiting Maiorana-McFarland constructions, that we borrow from\nconstruction of resilient functions. The questions we raise identify novel\ncombinatorial problems in the domain of Boolean functions.",

Wavelet design has been an active field of research\nfor over two decades, with the problem often being approached from an\nanalytical perspective. In this paper, we introduce a learning based approach\nto wavelet design. We draw a parallel between convolutional autoencoders and\nwavelet multiresolution approximation, and show how the learning angle provides\na coherent computational framework for addressing the design problem. We aim at\ndesigning data-independent wavelets by training filterbank autoencoders, which\nprecludes the need for customized datasets. In fact, we use high-dimensional\nGaussian vectors for training filterbank autoencoders, and show that a\nnear-zero training loss implies that the learnt filters satisfy the perfect\nreconstruction property with very high probability. Properties of a wavelet\nsuch as orthogonality, compact support, smoothness, symmetry, and vanishing\nmoments can be incorporated by designing the autoencoder architecture\nappropriately and with a suitable regularization term added to the mean-squared\nerror cost used in the learning process. Our approach not only recovers the\nwell known Daubechies family of orthogonal wavelets and the\nCohen-Daubechies-Feauveau family of symmetric biorthogonal wavelets, but also\nlearns wavelets outside these families.",

    "abstract": "Viewing neural network models in terms of their loss landscapes has a long\nhistory in the statistical mechanics approach to learning, and in recent years\nit has received attention within machine learning proper. Among other things,\nlocal metrics (such as the smoothness of the loss landscape) have been shown to\ncorrelate with global properties of the model (such as good generalization).\nHere, we perform a detailed empirical analysis of the loss landscape structure\nof thousands of neural network models, systematically varying learning tasks,\nmodel architectures, and/or quantity/quality of data. By considering a range of\nmetrics that attempt to capture different aspects of the loss landscape, we\ndemonstrate that the best test accuracy is obtained when: the loss landscape is\nglobally well-connected; ensembles of trained models are more similar to each\nother; and models converge to locally smooth regions. We also show that\nglobally poorly-connected landscapes can arise when models are small or when\nthey are trained to lower quality data; and that, if the loss landscape is\nglobally poorly-connected, then training to zero loss can actually lead to\nworse test accuracy. Based on these results, we develop a simple\none-dimensional model with load-like and temperature-like parameters, we\nintroduce the notion of an \\emph{effective loss landscape} depending on these\nparameters, and we interpret our results in terms of a \\emph{rugged convexity}\nof the loss landscape. When viewed through this lens, our detailed empirical\nresults shed light on phases of learning (and consequent double descent\nbehavior), fundamental versus incidental determinants of good generalization,\nthe role of load-like and temperature-like parameters in the learning process,\ndifferent influences on the loss landscape from model and data, and the\nrelationships between local and global metrics, all topics of recent interest.",

In the proposed model, both power generations and\nline susceptances become variables to minimize the expected generation cost and\nguarantee a low probability of constraint violation in terms of generations and\nline flows under renewable uncertainties. We figure out the mechanism of\nnetwork flexibility against uncertainties from the analytical form of CCED. On\none hand, renewable uncertainties shrink the usable line capacities in the line\nflow constraints and aggravate transmission congestion. On the other hand,\nnetwork flexibility significantly mitigates congestion by regulating the\nbase-case line flows and reducing the line capacity shrinkage caused by\nuncertainties. Further, we propose an alternate iteration solver for this\nproblem, which is efficient. With duality theory, we propose two convex\nsubproblems with respect to generation-related variables and network-related\nvariables, respectively. A satisfactory solution can be obtained by alternately\nsolving these two subproblems.

However, navigators trained with limited human-annotated\ninstructions may have difficulties in accurately capturing key information from\nthe complicated instruction at different timesteps, leading to poor navigation\nperformance. In this paper, we exploit to train a more robust navigator which\nis capable of dynamically extracting crucial factors from the long instruction,\nby using an adversarial attacking paradigm. Specifically, we propose a Dynamic\nReinforced Instruction Attacker (DR-Attacker), which learns to mislead the\nnavigator to move to the wrong target by destroying the most instructive\ninformation in instructions at different timesteps. By formulating the\nperturbation generation as a Markov Decision Process, DR-Attacker is optimized\nby the reinforcement learning algorithm to generate perturbed instructions\nsequentially during the navigation, according to a learnable attack score.\nThen, the perturbed instructions, which serve as hard samples, are used for\nimproving the robustness of the navigator with an effective adversarial\ntraining strategy and an auxiliary self-supervised reasoning task.

Existing\napproaches use images of unexpected objects from external datasets or require\nadditional training (e.g., retraining segmentation networks or training an\nextra network), which necessitate a non-trivial amount of labor intensity or\nlengthy inference time. One possible alternative is to use prediction scores of\na pre-trained network such as the max logits (i.e., maximum values among\nclasses before the final softmax layer) for detecting such objects. However,\nthe distribution of max logits of each predicted class is significantly\ndifferent from each other, which degrades the performance of identifying\nunexpected objects in urban-scene segmentation. To address this issue, we\npropose a simple yet effective approach that standardizes the max logits in\norder to align the different distributions and reflect the relative meanings of\nmax logits within each predicted class. Moreover, we consider the local regions\nfrom two different perspectives based on the intuition that neighboring pixels\nshare similar semantic information.

    "abstract": "Background: There is a growing awareness of the importance of human values\n(e.g., inclusiveness, privacy) in software systems. However, there are no\npractical tools to support the integration of human values during software\ndevelopment. We argue that a tool that can identify human values from software\ndevelopment artefacts and present them to varying software development roles\ncan (partially) address this gap. We refer to such a tool as human values\ndashboard. Further to this, our understanding of such a tool is limited. Aims:\nThis study aims to (1) investigate the possibility of using a human values\ndashboard to help address human values during software development, (2)\nidentify possible benefits of using a human values dashboard, and (3) elicit\npractitioners' needs from a human values dashboard. Method: We conducted an\nexploratory study by interviewing 15 software practitioners. A dashboard\nprototype was developed to support the interview process. We applied thematic\nanalysis to analyse the collected data. Results: Our study finds that a human\nvalues dashboard would be useful for the development team (e.g., project\nmanager, developer, tester). Our participants acknowledge that development\nartefacts, especially requirements documents and issue discussions, are the\nmost suitable source for identifying values for the dashboard.

    "abstract": "Robustness of huge Transformer-based models for natural language processing\nis an important issue due to their capabilities and wide adoption. One way to\nunderstand and improve robustness of these models is an exploration of an\nadversarial attack scenario: check if a small perturbation of an input can fool\na model.\nDue to the discrete nature of textual data, gradient-based adversarial\nmethods, widely used in computer vision, are not applicable per~se. The\nstandard strategy to overcome this issue is to develop token-level\ntransformations, which do not take the whole sentence into account.\nIn this paper, we propose a new black-box sentence-level attack. Our method\nfine-tunes a pre-trained language model to generate adversarial examples. A\nproposed differentiable loss function depends on a substitute classifier score\nand an approximate edit distance computed via a deep learning model.\nWe show that the proposed attack outperforms competitors on a diverse set of\nNLP problems for both computed metrics and human evaluation. Moreover, due to\nthe usage of the fine-tuned language model, the generated adversarial examples\nare hard to detect, thus current models are not robust. Hence, it is difficult\nto defend from the proposed attack, which is not the case for other attacks.",

The desired properties are enforced by applying a limiter to\nantidiffusive fluxes that represent the difference between the high-order\nbaseline scheme and a property-preserving approximation of Lax--Friedrichs\ntype. In the first step of the limiting procedure, the given target fluxes are\nadjusted in a way that guarantees preservation of local and/or global bounds.\nIn the second step, additional limiting is performed, if necessary,to ensure\nthe validity of fully discrete and/or semi-discrete entropy inequalities. The\nlimiter-based entropy fixes considered in this work are applicable to finite\nelement discretizations of scalar hyperbolic equations and systems alike. The\nunderlying inequality constraints are formulated using Tadmor's entropy\nstability theory.\nThe proposed limiters impose entropy-conservative or entropy-dissipative\nbounds on the rate of entropy production by antidiffusive fluxes and\nRunge--Kutta (RK) time discretizations. Two versions of the fully discrete\nentropy fix are developed for this purpose. To motivate the use of\nlimiter-based entropy fixes, we prove a finite element version of the\nLax--Wendroff theorem and perform numerical studies for standard test problems.\nIn our numerical experiments, entropy-dissipative schemes converge to correct\nweak solutions of scalar conservation laws, of the Euler equations, and of the\nshallow water equations.",

    "abstract": "Heatmap-based methods dominate in the field of human pose estimation by\nmodelling the output distribution through likelihood heatmaps. In contrast,\nregression-based methods are more efficient but suffer from inferior\nperformance. In this work, we explore maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to\ndevelop an efficient and effective regression-based methods. From the\nperspective of MLE, adopting different regression losses is making different\nassumptions about the output density function. A density function closer to the\ntrue distribution leads to a better regression performance. In light of this,\nwe propose a novel regression paradigm with Residual Log-likelihood Estimation\n(RLE) to capture the underlying output distribution. Concretely, RLE learns the\nchange of the distribution instead of the unreferenced underlying distribution\nto facilitate the training process. With the proposed reparameterization\ndesign, our method is compatible with off-the-shelf flow models. The proposed\nmethod is effective, efficient and flexible. We show its potential in various\nhuman pose estimation tasks with comprehensive experiments. Compared to the\nconventional regression paradigm, regression with RLE bring 12.4 mAP\nimprovement on MSCOCO without any test-time overhead. Moreover, for the first\ntime, especially on multi-person pose estimation, our regression method is\nsuperior to the heatmap-based methods.

    "abstract": "In recent years, computer vision algorithms have become more and more\npowerful, which enabled technologies such as autonomous driving to evolve with\nrapid pace. However, current algorithms mainly share one limitation: They rely\non directly visible objects. This is a major drawback compared to human\nbehavior, where indirect visual cues caused by the actual object (e.g.,\nshadows) are already used intuitively to retrieve information or anticipate\noccurring objects. While driving at night, this performance deficit becomes\neven more obvious: Humans already process the light artifacts caused by\noncoming vehicles to assume their future appearance, whereas current object\ndetection systems rely on the oncoming vehicle's direct visibility. Based on\nprevious work in this subject, we present with this paper a complete system\ncapable of solving the task to providently detect oncoming vehicles at\nnighttime based on their caused light artifacts. For that, we outline the full\nalgorithm architecture ranging from the detection of light artifacts in the\nimage space, localizing the objects in the three-dimensional space, and\nverifying the objects over time. To demonstrate the applicability, we deploy\nthe system in a test vehicle and use the information of providently detected\nvehicles to control the glare-free high beam system proactively. Using this\nexperimental setting, we quantify the time benefit that the provident vehicle\ndetection system provides compared to an in-production computer vision system.\nAdditionally, the glare-free high beam use case provides a real-time and\nreal-world visualization interface of the detection results. With this\ncontribution, we want to put awareness on the unconventional sensing task of\nprovident object detection and further close the performance gap between human\nbehavior and computer vision algorithms in order to bring autonomous and\nautomated driving a step forward.",

However, more recent deep learning\nbased solutions to SLP have tackled the problem using a single network that\nestimates the full skeletal structure.\nWe propose splitting the SLP task into two distinct jointly-trained\nsub-tasks.

    "abstract": "Forest carbon offsets are increasingly popular and can play a significant\nrole in financing climate mitigation, forest conservation, and reforestation.\nMeasuring how much carbon is stored in forests is, however, still largely done\nvia expensive, time-consuming, and sometimes unaccountable field measurements.\nTo overcome these limitations, many verification bodies are leveraging machine\nlearning (ML) algorithms to estimate forest carbon from satellite or aerial\nimagery. Aerial imagery allows for tree species or family classification, which\nimproves the satellite imagery-based forest type classification. However,\naerial imagery is significantly more expensive to collect and it is unclear by\nhow much the higher resolution improves the forest carbon estimation. This\nproposal paper describes the first systematic comparison of forest carbon\nestimation from aerial imagery, satellite imagery, and ground-truth field\nmeasurements via deep learning-based algorithms for a tropical reforestation\nproject. Our initial results show that forest carbon estimates from satellite\nimagery can overestimate above-ground biomass by more than 10-times for\ntropical reforestation projects. The significant difference between aerial and\nsatellite-derived forest carbon measurements shows the potential for aerial\nimagery-based ML algorithms and raises the importance to extend this study to a\nglobal benchmark between options for carbon measurements.",

    "abstract": "Recent work has shown that graph neural networks (GNNs) are vulnerable to\nadversarial attacks on graph data. Common attack approaches are typically\ninformed, i.e. they have access to information about node attributes such as\nlabels and feature vectors. In this work, we study adversarial attacks that are\nuninformed, where an attacker only has access to the graph structure, but no\ninformation about node attributes. Here the attacker aims to exploit structural\nknowledge and assumptions, which GNN models make about graph data. In\nparticular, literature has shown that structural node centrality and similarity\nhave a strong influence on learning with GNNs. Therefore, we study the impact\nof centrality and similarity on adversarial attacks on GNNs. We demonstrate\nthat attackers can exploit this information to decrease the performance of GNNs\nby focusing on injecting links between nodes of low similarity and,\nsurprisingly, low centrality. We show that structure-based uninformed attacks\ncan approach the performance of informed attacks, while being computationally\nmore efficient. With our paper, we present a new attack strategy on GNNs that\nwe refer to as Structack. Structack can successfully manipulate the performance\nof GNNs with very limited information while operating under tight computational\nconstraints.

    "title": "How to Trust Strangers: Composition of Byzantine Quorum Systems",
    "abstract": "Trust is the basis of any distributed, fault-tolerant, or secure system. A\ntrust assumption specifies the failures that a system, such as a blockchain\nnetwork, can tolerate and determines the conditions under which it operates\ncorrectly. In systems subject to Byzantine faults, the trust assumption is\nusually specified through sets of processes that may fail together. Trust has\ntraditionally been symmetric, such that all processes in the system adhere to\nthe same, global assumption about potential faults. Recently, asymmetric trust\nmodels have also been considered, especially in the context of blockchains,\nwhere every participant is free to choose who to trust.\nIn both cases, it is an open question how to compose trust assumptions.\nConsider two or more systems, run by different and possibly disjoint sets of\nparticipants, with different assumptions about faults: how can they work\ntogether? This work answers this question for the first time and offers\ncomposition rules for symmetric and for asymmetric quorum systems. These rules\nare static and do not require interaction or agreement on the new trust\nassumption among the participants. Moreover, they ensure that if the original\nsystems allow for running a particular protocol (guaranteeing consistency and\navailability), then so will the joint system. At the same time, the composed\nsystem tolerates as many faults as possible, subject to the underlying\nconsistency and availability properties.\nReaching consensus with asymmetric trust in the model of personal Byzantine\nquorum systems (Losa et al., DISC 2019) was shown to be impossible, if the\ntrust assumptions of the processes diverge from each other. With asymmetric\nquorum systems, and by applying our composition rule, we show how consensus is\nactually possible, even with the combination of disjoint sets of processes.",

    "abstract": "Most of existing studies on adaptive submodular optimization focus on the\naverage-case, i.e., their objective is to find a policy that maximizes the\nexpected utility over a known distribution of realizations. However, a policy\nthat has a good average-case performance may have very poor performance under\nthe worst-case realization. In this study, we propose to study two variants of\nadaptive submodular optimization problems, namely, worst-case adaptive\nsubmodular maximization and robust submodular maximization. The first problem\naims to find a policy that maximizes the worst-case utility and the latter one\naims to find a policy, if any, that achieves both near optimal average-case\nutility and worst-case utility simultaneously. We introduce a new class of\nstochastic functions, called \\emph{worst-case submodular function}. For the\nworst-case adaptive submodular maximization problem subject to a $p$-system\nconstraint, we develop an adaptive worst-case greedy policy that achieves a\n$\\frac{1}{p+1}$ approximation ratio against the optimal worst-case utility if\nthe utility function is worst-case submodular. For the robust adaptive\nsubmodular maximization problem subject to a cardinality constraint, if the\nutility function is both worst-case submodular and adaptive submodular, we\ndevelop a hybrid adaptive policy that achieves an approximation close to\n$1-e^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$ under both worst case setting and average case setting\nsimultaneously. We also describe several applications of our theoretical\nresults, including pool-base active learning, stochastic submodular set cover\nand adaptive viral marketing.",

    "abstract": "Side-channel attacks are a security exploit that take advantage of\ninformation leakage. They use measurement and analysis of physical parameters\nto reverse engineer and extract secrets from a system. Power analysis attacks\nin particular, collect a set of power traces from a computing device and use\nstatistical techniques to correlate this information with the attacked\napplication data and source code. Counter measures like just-in-time\ncompilation, random code injection and instruction descheduling obfuscate the\nexecution of instructions to reduce the security risk. Unfortunately, due to\nthe randomness and excess instructions executed by these solutions, they\nintroduce large overheads in performance, power and area.\nIn this work we propose a scheduling algorithm that dynamically reorders\ninstructions in an out-of-order processor to provide obfuscated execution and\nmitigate power analysis attacks with little-to-no effect on the performance,\npower or area of the processor. We exploit the time between operand\navailability of critical instructions (slack) to create high-performance random\nschedules without requiring additional instructions or static prescheduling.\nFurther, we perform an extended security analysis using different attacks.

One way to deal with this problem is\nby fully decentralizing the classic zero-forcing receiver across multiple\nprocessing nodes based on the gradient descent method. In this paper, we first\nexplicitly relate this decentralized receiver to a distributed version of the\nKaczmarz algorithm and to the use of the successive interference cancellation\n(SIC) philosophy to mitigate the residual across nodes. In addition, we propose\ntwo methods to further accelerate the initial convergence of these iterative\ndecentralized receivers by exploring the connection with the Kaczmarz\nalgorithm: 1) a new Bayesian distributed receiver, which can eliminate noise on\nan iteration basis; 2) a more practical method for choosing the relaxation\nparameter. The discussion also consider spatial non-stationarities that arise\nwhen the antenna arrays are extremely large (XL-MIMO). We were able to improve\nthe numerical results for both spatially stationary and non-stationary\nchannels, but mainly the non-stationary performance can still be improved\ncompared to the centralized ZF receiver.

    "abstract": "While achieving state-of-the-art results in multiple tasks and languages,\ntranslation-based cross-lingual transfer is often overlooked in favour of\nmassively multilingual pre-trained encoders. Arguably, this is due to its main\nlimitations: 1) translation errors percolating to the classification phase and\n2) the insufficient expressiveness of the maximum-likelihood translation. To\nremedy this, we propose a new technique that integrates both steps of the\ntraditional pipeline (translation and classification) into a single model, by\ntreating the intermediate translations as a latent random variable. As a\nresult, 1) the neural machine translation system can be fine-tuned with a\nvariant of Minimum Risk Training where the reward is the accuracy of the\ndownstream task classifier. Moreover, 2) multiple samples can be drawn to\napproximate the expected loss across all possible translations during\ninference. We evaluate our novel latent translation-based model on a series of\nmultilingual NLU tasks, including commonsense reasoning, paraphrase\nidentification, and natural language inference. We report gains for both\nzero-shot and few-shot learning setups, up to 2.7 accuracy points on average,\nwhich are even more prominent for low-resource languages (e.g., Haitian\nCreole).

However, there is little existing work testing\nassumption, especially given that visually computing ratios is relatively\nunimportant in real-world visualizations, compared to seeing, remembering, and\ncomparing trends and motifs, across displays that almost universally depict\nmore than two values.\nWe asked participants to immediately reproduce a set of values from memory.\nWith a Bayesian multilevel modeling approach, we observed how the relevant rank\npositions of visual channels shift across different numbers of marks (2, 4 or\n8) and for bias, precision, and error measures. The ranking did not hold, even\nfor reproductions of only 2 marks, and the new ranking was highly inconsistent\nfor reproductions of different numbers of marks. Other factors besides channel\nchoice far more influence on performance, such as the number of values in the\nseries (e.g. more marks led to larger errors), or the value of each mark (e.g.\nsmall values are systematically overestimated).\nRecall was worse for displays with 8 marks than 4, consistent with\nestablished limits on visual memory.

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles (AV) are expected to revolutionize transportation and\nimprove road safety significantly. However, these benefits do not come without\ncost; AVs require large Deep-Learning (DL) models and powerful hardware\nplatforms to operate reliably in real-time, requiring between several hundred\nwatts to one kilowatt of power. This power consumption can dramatically reduce\nvehicles' driving range and affect emissions. To address this problem, we\npropose SAGE: a methodology for selectively offloading the key energy-consuming\nmodules of DL architectures to the cloud to optimize edge energy usage while\nmeeting real-time latency constraints. Furthermore, we leverage Head Network\nDistillation (HND) to introduce efficient bottlenecks within the DL\narchitecture in order to minimize the network overhead costs of offloading with\nalmost no degradation in the model's performance. We evaluate SAGE using an\nNvidia Jetson TX2 and an industry-standard Nvidia Drive PX2 as the AV edge\ndevices and demonstrate that our offloading strategy is practical for a wide\nrange of DL models and internet connection bandwidths on 3G, 4G LTE, and WiFi\ntechnologies. Compared to edge-only computation, SAGE reduces energy\nconsumption by an average of 36.13%, 47.07%, and 55.66% for an AV with one\nlow-resolution camera, one high-resolution camera, and three high-resolution\ncameras, respectively. SAGE also reduces upload data size by up to 98.40%\ncompared to direct camera offloading.",

    "abstract": "We study the complexity of the decision problem known as Permutation Pattern\nMatching, or PPM. The input of PPM consists of a pair of permutations $\\tau$\n(the `text') and $\\pi$ (the `pattern'), and the goal is to decide whether\n$\\tau$ contains $\\pi$ as a subpermutation. On general inputs, PPM is known to\nbe NP-complete by a result of Bose, Buss and Lubiw. In this paper, we focus on\nrestricted instances of PPM where the text is assumed to avoid a fixed (small)\npattern $\\sigma$; this restriction is known as Av($\\sigma$)-PPM. It has been\npreviously shown that Av($\\sigma$)-PPM is polynomial for any $\\sigma$ of size\nat most 3, while it is NP-hard for any $\\sigma$ containing a monotone\nsubsequence of length four.\nIn this paper, we present a new hardness reduction which allows us to show,\nin a uniform way, that Av($\\sigma$)-PPM is hard for every $\\sigma$ of size at\nleast 6, for every $\\sigma$ of size 5 except the symmetry class of $41352$, as\nwell as for every $\\sigma$ symmetric to one of the three permutations $4321$,\n$4312$ and $4213$. Moreover, assuming the exponential time hypothesis, none of\nthese hard cases of Av($\\sigma$)-PPM can be solved in time $2^{o(n/\\log n)}$.\nPreviously, such conditional lower bound was not known even for the\nunconstrained PPM problem.\nOn the tractability side, we combine the CSP approach of Guillemot and Marx\nwith the structural results of Huczynska and Vatter to show that for any\nmonotone-griddable permutation class C, PPM is polynomial when the text is\nrestricted to a permutation from C.",

Exploiting\nthe recently-proposed unpaired image-to-image translation between cell nuclei\nimages and randomly synthetic masks, existing approaches, e.g., CycleGAN, have\nachieved encouraging results. However, these methods usually take a two-stage\npipeline and fail to learn end-to-end in cell nuclei images. More seriously,\nthey could lead to the lossy transformation problem, i.e., the content\ninconsistency between the original images and the corresponding segmentation\noutput. To address these limitations, we propose a novel end-to-end\nunsupervised framework called Aligned Disentangling Generative Adversarial\nNetwork (AD-GAN). Distinctively, AD-GAN introduces representation\ndisentanglement to separate content representation (the underling spatial\nstructure) from style representation (the rendering of the structure). With\nthis framework, spatial structure can be preserved explicitly, enabling a\nsignificant reduction of macro-level lossy transformation. We also propose a\nnovel training algorithm able to align the disentangled content in the latent\nspace to reduce micro-level lossy transformation. Evaluations on real-world 2D\nand 3D datasets show that AD-GAN substantially outperforms the other comparison\nmethods and the professional software both quantitatively and qualitatively.\nSpecifically, the proposed AD-GAN leads to significant improvement over the\ncurrent best unsupervised methods by an average 17.8% relatively (w.r.t. the\nmetric DICE) on four cell nuclei datasets. As an unsupervised method, AD-GAN\neven performs competitive with the best supervised models, taking a further\nleap towards end-to-end unsupervised nuclei segmentation.",

    "abstract": "All-digital basestation (BS) architectures for millimeter-wave (mmWave)\nmassive multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO), which equip each\nradio-frequency chain with dedicated data converters, have advantages in\nspectral efficiency, flexibility, and baseband-processing simplicity over\nhybrid analog-digital solutions. For all-digital architectures to be\ncompetitive with hybrid solutions in terms of power consumption, novel\nsignal-processing methods and baseband architectures are necessary. In this\npaper, we demonstrate that adapting the resolution of the analog-to-digital\nconverters (ADCs) and spatial equalizer of an all-digital system to the\ncommunication scenario (e.g., the number of users, modulation scheme, and\npropagation conditions) enables orders-of-magnitude power savings for realistic\nmmWave channels. For example, for a 256-BS-antenna 16-user system supporting 1\nGHz bandwidth, a traditional baseline architecture designed for a 64-user\nworst-case scenario would consume 23 W in 28 nm CMOS for the ADC array and the\nspatial equalizer, whereas a resolution-adaptive architecture is able to reduce\nthe power consumption by 6.7x.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of qubit numbers and coherence times in quantum\nhardware technology, implementing shallow neural networks on the so-called\nNoisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices has attracted a lot of\ninterest. Many quantum (convolutional) circuit ansaetze are proposed for\ngrayscale images classification tasks with promising empirical results.\nHowever, when applying these ansaetze on RGB images, the intra-channel\ninformation that is useful for vision tasks is not extracted effectively. In\nthis paper, we propose two types of quantum circuit ansaetze to simulate\nconvolution operations on RGB images, which differ in the way how inter-channel\nand intra-channel information are extracted. To the best of our knowledge, this\nis the first work of a quantum convolutional circuit to deal with RGB images\neffectively, with a higher test accuracy compared to the purely classical CNNs.\nWe also investigate the relationship between the size of quantum circuit ansatz\nand the learnability of the hybrid quantum-classical convolutional neural\nnetwork. Through experiments based on CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets, we\ndemonstrate that a larger size of the quantum circuit ansatz improves\npredictive performance in multiclass classification tasks, providing useful\ninsights for near term quantum algorithm developments.",

    "abstract": "Identification of the so-called dynamic networks is one of the most\nchallenging problems appeared recently in control literature. Such systems\nconsist of large-scale interconnected systems, also called modules. To recover\nfull networks dynamics the two crucial steps are topology detection, where one\nhas to infer from data which connections are active, and modules estimation.\nSince a small percentage of connections are effective in many real systems, the\nproblem finds also fundamental connections with group-sparse estimation. In\nparticular, in the linear setting modules correspond to unknown impulse\nresponses expected to have null norm but in a small fraction of samples. This\npaper introduces a new Bayesian approach for linear dynamic networks\nidentification where impulse responses are described through the combination of\ntwo particular prior distributions. The first one is a block version of the\nhorseshoe prior, a model possessing important global-local shrinkage features.\nThe second one is the stable spline prior, that encodes information on\nsmooth-exponential decay of the modules. The resulting model is called stable\nspline horseshoe (SSH) prior. It implements aggressive shrinkage of small\nimpulse responses while larger impulse responses are conveniently subject to\nstable spline regularization. Inference is performed by a Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo scheme, tailored to the dynamic context and able to efficiently return\nthe posterior of the modules in sampled form. We include numerical studies that\nshow how the new approach can accurately reconstruct sparse networks dynamics\nalso when thousands of unknown impulse response coefficients must be inferred\nfrom data sets of relatively small size.",

    "abstract": "Customers' emotions play a vital role in the service industry. The better\nfrontline personnel understand the customer, the better the service they can\nprovide. As human emotions generate certain (unintentional) bodily reactions,\nsuch as increase in heart rate, sweating, dilation, blushing and paling, which\nare measurable, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies can interpret these\nsignals. Great progress has been made in recent years to automatically detect\nbasic emotions like joy, anger etc. Complex emotions, consisting of multiple\ninterdependent basic emotions, are more difficult to identify. One complex\nemotion which is of great interest to the service industry is difficult to\ndetect: whether a customer is telling the truth or just a story. This research\npresents an AI-method for capturing and sensing emotional data. With an\naccuracy of around 98 %, the best trained model was able to detect whether a\nparticipant of a debating challenge was arguing for or against her/his\nconviction, using speech analysis. The data set was collected in an\nexperimental setting with 40 participants. The findings are applicable to a\nwide range of service processes and specifically useful for all customer\ninteractions that take place via telephone. The algorithm presented can be\napplied in any situation where it is helpful for the agent to know whether a\ncustomer is speaking to her/his conviction.

However, in some applications, the receiver only needs part of\nthe source data that represents critical semantic information, which prompts to\ntransmit the application-related information, especially when bandwidth\nresources are limited. In this paper, we consider a semantic communication\nsystem for speech recognition by designing the transceiver as an end-to-end\n(E2E) system. Particularly, a deep learning (DL)-enabled semantic communication\nsystem, named DeepSC-SR, is developed to learn and extract text-related\nsemantic features at the transmitter, which motivates the system to transmit\nmuch less than the source speech data without performance degradation.\nMoreover, in order to facilitate the proposed DeepSC-SR for dynamic channel\nenvironments, we investigate a robust model to cope with various channel\nenvironments without requiring retraining. The simulation results demonstrate\nthat our proposed DeepSC-SR outperforms the traditional communication systems\nin terms of the speech recognition metrics, such as character-error-rate and\nword-error-rate, and is more robust to channel variations, especially in the\nlow signal-to-noise (SNR) regime.",

Deriving joint Shapley\nvalues in ML attribution problems thus gives us the first measure of the joint\neffect of sets of features on model predictions. In a dataset with binary\nfeatures, we present a presence-adjusted method for calculating global values\nthat retains the efficiency property.",

    "title": "Optimum Risk Portfolio and Eigen Portfolio: A Comparative Analysis Using  Selected Stocks from the Indian Stock Market",
    "abstract": "Designing an optimum portfolio that allocates weights to its constituent\nstocks in a way that achieves the best trade-off between the return and the\nrisk is a challenging research problem. The classical mean-variance theory of\nportfolio proposed by Markowitz is found to perform sub-optimally on the\nreal-world stock market data since the error in estimation for the expected\nreturns adversely affects the performance of the portfolio. This paper presents\nthree approaches to portfolio design, viz, the minimum risk portfolio, the\noptimum risk portfolio, and the Eigen portfolio, for seven important sectors of\nthe Indian stock market. The daily historical prices of the stocks are scraped\nfrom Yahoo Finance website from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2020. Three\nportfolios are built for each of the seven sectors chosen for this study, and\nthe portfolios are analyzed on the training data based on several metrics such\nas annualized return and risk, weights assigned to the constituent stocks, the\ncorrelation heatmaps, and the principal components of the Eigen portfolios.\nFinally, the optimum risk portfolios and the Eigen portfolios for all sectors\nare tested on their return over a period of a six-month period. The\nperformances of the portfolios are compared and the portfolio yielding the\nhigher return for each sector is identified.",
