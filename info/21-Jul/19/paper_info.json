    "abstract": "Candidates arrive sequentially for an interview process which results in them\nbeing ranked relative to their predecessors. Based on the ranks available at\neach time, one must develop a decision mechanism that selects or dismisses the\ncurrent candidate in an effort to maximize the chance to select the best. This\nclassical version of the \"Secretary problem\" has been studied in depth using\nmostly combinatorial approaches, along with numerous other variants. In this\nwork we consider a particular new version where during reviewing one is allowed\nto query an external expert to improve the probability of making the correct\ndecision. Unlike existing formulations, we consider experts that are not\nnecessarily infallible and may provide suggestions that can be faulty. For the\nsolution of our problem we adopt a probabilistic methodology and view the\nquerying times as consecutive stopping times which we optimize with the help of\noptimal stopping theory. For each querying time we must also design a mechanism\nto decide whether we should terminate the search at the querying time or not.\nThis decision is straightforward under the usual assumption of infallible\nexperts but, when experts are faulty, it has a far more intricate structure.",

    "title": "Unsupervised 3D Human Mesh Recovery from Noisy Point Clouds",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel unsupervised approach to reconstruct human shape\nand pose from noisy point cloud. Traditional approaches search for\ncorrespondences and conduct model fitting iteratively where a good\ninitialization is critical. Relying on large amount of dataset with\nground-truth annotations, recent learning-based approaches predict\ncorrespondences for every vertice on the point cloud; Chamfer distance is\nusually used to minimize the distance between a deformed template model and the\ninput point cloud. However, Chamfer distance is quite sensitive to noise and\noutliers, thus could be unreliable to assign correspondences. To address these\nissues, we model the probability distribution of the input point cloud as\ngenerated from a parametric human model under a Gaussian Mixture Model. Instead\nof explicitly aligning correspondences, we treat the process of correspondence\nsearch as an implicit probabilistic association by updating the posterior\nprobability of the template model given the input. A novel unsupervised loss is\nfurther derived that penalizes the discrepancy between the deformed template\nand the input point cloud conditioned on the posterior probability. Our\napproach is very flexible, which works with both complete point cloud and\nincomplete ones including even a single depth image as input. Our network is\ntrained from scratch with no need to warm-up the network with supervised data.\nCompared to previous unsupervised methods, our method shows the capability to\ndeal with substantial noise and outliers. Extensive experiments conducted on\nvarious public synthetic datasets as well as a very noisy real dataset (i.e.\nCMU Panoptic) demonstrate the superior performance of our approach over the\nstate-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "This paper improves the robustness of the pretrained language model BERT\nagainst word substitution-based adversarial attacks by leveraging\nself-supervised contrastive learning with adversarial perturbations. One\nadvantage of our method compared to previous works is that it is capable of\nimproving model robustness without using any labels. Additionally, we also\ncreate an adversarial attack for word-level adversarial training on BERT. The\nattack is efficient, allowing adversarial training for BERT on adversarial\nexamples generated on the fly during training. Experimental results on four\ndatasets show that our method improves the robustness of BERT against four\ndifferent word substitution-based adversarial attacks. Furthermore, to\nunderstand why our method can improve the model robustness against adversarial\nattacks, we study vector representations of clean examples and their\ncorresponding adversarial examples before and after applying our method. As our\nmethod improves model robustness with unlabeled raw data, it opens up the\npossibility of using large text datasets to train robust language models.",

    "abstract": "Continual learning in computational systems is challenging due to\ncatastrophic forgetting. We discovered a two layer neural circuit in the fruit\nfly olfactory system that addresses this challenge by uniquely combining sparse\ncoding and associative learning. In the first layer, odors are encoded using\nsparse, high dimensional representations, which reduces memory interference by\nactivating non overlapping populations of neurons for different odors. In the\nsecond layer, only the synapses between odor activated neurons and the output\nneuron associated with the odor are modified during learning; the rest of the\nweights are frozen to prevent unrelated memories from being overwritten. We\nshow empirically and analytically that this simple and lightweight algorithm\nsignificantly boosts continual learning performance. The fly associative\nlearning algorithm is strikingly similar to the classic perceptron learning\nalgorithm, albeit two modifications, which we show are critical for reducing\ncatastrophic forgetting. Overall, fruit flies evolved an efficient lifelong\nlearning algorithm, and circuit mechanisms from neuroscience can be translated\nto improve machine computation.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the channel estimation problem in correlated massive\nmultiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems with a reduced number of\nradio-frequency (RF) chains. Importantly, other than the knowledge of channel\ncorrelation matrices, we make no assumption as to the structure of the channel.\nTo address the limitation in the number of RF chains, we employ hybrid\nbeamforming, comprising a low dimensional digital beamformer followed by an\nanalog beamformer implemented using phase shifters. Since there is no dedicated\nRF chain per transmitter/receiver antenna, the conventional channel estimation\ntechniques for fully-digital systems are impractical. By exploiting the fact\nthat the channel entries are uncorrelated in its eigen-domain, we seek to\nestimate the channel entries in this domain. Due to the limited number of RF\nchains, channel estimation is typically performed in multiple time slots. Under\na total energy budget, we aim to design the hybrid transmit beamformer\n(precoder) and the receive beamformer (combiner) in each training time slot, in\norder to estimate the channel using the minimum mean squared error criterion.\nTo this end, we choose the precoder and combiner in each time slot such that\nthey are aligned to transmitter and receiver eigen-directions, respectively.\nFurther, we derive a water-filling-type expression for the optimal energy\nallocation at each time slot. This expression illustrates that, with a low\ntraining energy budget, only significant components of the channel need to be\nestimated. In contrast, with a large training energy budget, the energy is\nalmost equally distributed among all eigen-directions. Simulation results show\nthat the proposed channel estimation scheme can efficiently estimate correlated\nmassive MIMO channels within a few training time slots.",

It frequently comes up in algorithms\nfor Knapsack, $k$-SUM, All-Pairs Shortest Paths, and string pattern matching\nproblems. For these applications it typically suffices to compute convolutions\nof nonnegative vectors. This problem can be classically solved in time $O(n\\log\nn)$ using the Fast Fourier Transform.\nHowever, often the involved vectors are sparse and hence one could hope for\noutput-sensitive algorithms to compute nonnegative convolutions. This question\nwas raised by Muthukrishnan and solved by Cole and Hariharan (STOC '02) by a\nrandomized algorithm running in near-linear time in the (unknown) output-size\n$t$. Chan and Lewenstein (STOC '15) presented a deterministic algorithm with a\n$2^{O(\\sqrt{\\log t\\cdot\\log\\log n})}$ overhead in running time and the\nadditional assumption that a small superset of the output is given; this\nassumption was later removed by Bringmann and Nakos (ICALP '21).\nIn this paper we present the first deterministic near-linear-time algorithm\nfor computing sparse nonnegative convolutions. This immediately gives improved\ndeterministic algorithms for the state-of-the-art of output-sensitive Subset\nSum, block-mass pattern matching, $N$-fold Boolean convolution, and others,\nmatching up to log-factors the fastest known randomized algorithms for these\nproblems. Our algorithm is a blend of algebraic and combinatorial ideas and\ntechniques.\nAdditionally, we provide two fast Las Vegas algorithms for computing sparse\nnonnegative convolutions. In particular, we present a simple $O(t\\log^2t)$ time\nalgorithm, which is an accessible alternative to Cole and Hariharan's\nalgorithm. We further refine this new algorithm to run in Las Vegas time\n$O(t\\log t\\cdot\\log\\log t)$, matching the running time of the dense case apart\nfrom the $\\log\\log t$ factor.",

State-of-the-art deep\nlearning solutions for image upsampling are currently trained using either\nresize or sub-pixel convolution to learn kernels that generate high fidelity\nimages with minimal artifacts. However, performing inference with these learned\nconvolution kernels requires memory-intensive feature map transformations that\ndominate time and energy costs in real-time applications. To alleviate this\npressure on memory bandwidth, we confine the use of resize or sub-pixel\nconvolution to training in the cloud by transforming learned convolution\nkernels to deconvolution kernels before deploying them for inference as a\nfunctionally equivalent deconvolution. These kernel transformations, intended\nas a one-time cost when shifting from training to inference, enable a systems\ndesigner to use each algorithm in their optimal context by preserving the image\nfidelity learned when training in the cloud while minimizing data transfer\npenalties during inference at the edge. We also explore existing variants of\ndeconvolution inference algorithms and introduce a novel variant for\nconsideration. We analyze and compare the inference properties of\nconvolution-based upsampling algorithms using a quantitative model of incurred\ntime and energy costs and show that using deconvolution for inference at the\nedge improves both system latency and energy efficiency when compared to their\nsub-pixel or resize convolution counterparts.",

    "abstract": "Formally reasoning about functional programs is supposed to be\nstraightforward and elegant, however, it is not typically done as a matter of\ncourse. Reasoning in a proof assistant requires \"reimplementing\" the code in\nthose tools, which is far from trivial. SMLtoCoq provides an automatic\ntranslation of SML programs and function contracts into Coq. Programs are\ntranslated into Coq specifications, and function contracts into theorems, which\ncan then be formally proved. Using the Equations plugin and other well\nestablished Coq libraries, SMLtoCoq is able to translate SML programs without\nside-effects containing partial functions, structures, functors, records, among\nothers. Additionally, we provide a Coq version of many parts of SML's basis\nlibrary, so that calls to these libraries are kept almost as is.",

    "abstract": "Despite recent advances in automating theorem proving in full first-order\ntheories, inductive reasoning still poses a serious challenge to\nstate-of-the-art theorem provers. The reason for that is that in first-order\nlogic induction requires an infinite number of axioms, which is not a feasible\ninput to a computer-aided theorem prover requiring a finite input. Mathematical\npractice is to specify these infinite sets of axioms as axiom schemes.\nUnfortunately these schematic definitions cannot be formalized in first-order\nlogic, and therefore not supported as inputs for first-order theorem provers.\nIn this work we introduce a new method, inspired by the field of axiomatic\ntheories of truth, that allows to express schematic inductive definitions, in\nthe standard syntax of multi-sorted first-order logic. Further we test the\npractical feasibility of the method with state-of-the-art theorem provers,\ncomparing it to solvers' native techniques for handling induction.",

However, proof assistant implementations\nthemselves are seldom verified, although they take a major share of the trusted\ncode base in any such certification effort. In this area, proof assistants\nbased on Higher-Order Logic enjoy stronger guarantees, as self-certified\nimplementations have been available for some years. One cause of this\ndifference is the inherent complexity of dependent type theories together with\ntheir extensions with inductive types, universe polymorphism and complex sort\nsystems, and the gap between theory on paper and practical implementations in\nefficient programming languages. MetaCoq is a collaborative project that aims\nto tackle these difficulties to provide the first fully-certified realistic\nimplementation of a type checker for the full calculus underlying the Coq proof\nassistant. To achieve this, we refined the sometimes blurry, if not incorrect,\nspecification and implementation of the system. We show how theoretical tools\nfrom this community such as bidirectional type-checking,\nTait-Martin-L\\\"of/Takahashi's confluence proof technique and monadic and\ndependently-typed programming can help construct the following artefacts: a\nspecification of Coq's syntax and type theory, the Polymorphic Cumulative\nCalculus of (Co)-Inductive Constructions (PCUIC); a monad for the manipulation\nof raw syntax and interaction with the Coq system; a verification of PCUIC's\nmetatheory, whose main results are the confluence of reduction, type\npreservation and principality of typing; a realistic, correct and complete\ntype-checker for PCUIC; a sound type and proof erasure procedure from PCUIC to\nuntyped lambda-calculus, i.e., the core of the extraction mechanism of Coq.",

Deep neural networks\nhave become a popular technique for tracing ECG signals, outperforming human\nexperts.

Moreover, they do not generalize well on the out-of-distribution\ndataset.

To alleviate this, we propose\na novel Conditional Generative Adversarial Network to simultaneously generate\nECG signals for different categories and detect cardiac abnormalities.\nMoreover, the model is conditioned on class-specific ECG signals to synthesize\nrealistic adversarial examples.

    "abstract": "Parts fabricated by additive manufacturing (AM) are often fabricated first as\na near-net shape, a combination of intended nominal geometry and sacrificial\nsupport structures, which need to be removed in a subsequent post-processing\nstage using subtractive manufacturing (SM). In this paper, we present a\nframework for optimizing the build orientation with respect to removability of\nsupport structures. In particular, given a general multi-axis machining setup\nand sampled build orientations, we define a Pareto-optimality criterion based\non the total support volume and the \"secluded\" support volume defined as the\nsupport volume that is not accessible by a given set of machining tools. Since\ntotal support volume mainly depends on the build orientation and the secluded\nvolume is dictated by the machining setup, in many cases the two objectives are\ncompeting and their trade-off needs to be taken into account. The accessibility\nanalysis relies on the inaccessibility measure field (IMF), which is a\ncontinuous field in the Euclidean space that quantifies the inaccessibility of\neach point given a collection of tools and fixturing devices. The value of IMF\nat each point indicates the minimum possible volumetric collision between\nobjects in relative motion including the part, fixtures, and the tools, over\nall possible tool orientations and sharp points on the tool. We also propose an\nautomated support removal planning algorithm based on IMF, where a sequence of\nactions are provided in terms of the fixturing devices, cutting tools, and tool\norientation at each step. In our approach, each step is chosen based on the\nmaximal removable volume to iteratively remove accessible supports. The\neffectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through benchmark\nexamples in 2D and realistic examples in 3D.",

    "abstract": "We introduce Neural Contextual Anomaly Detection (NCAD), a framework for\nanomaly detection on time series that scales seamlessly from the unsupervised\nto supervised setting, and is applicable to both univariate and multivariate\ntime series. This is achieved by effectively combining recent developments in\nrepresentation learning for multivariate time series, with techniques for deep\nanomaly detection originally developed for computer vision that we tailor to\nthe time series setting. Our window-based approach facilitates learning the\nboundary between normal and anomalous classes by injecting generic synthetic\nanomalies into the available data. Moreover, our method can effectively take\nadvantage of all the available information, be it as domain knowledge, or as\ntraining labels in the semi-supervised setting. We demonstrate empirically on\nstandard benchmark datasets that our approach obtains a state-of-the-art\nperformance in these settings.",

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation for scene understanding is nowadays widely demanded,\nraising significant challenges for the algorithm efficiency, especially its\napplications on resource-limited platforms. Current segmentation models are\ntrained and evaluated on massive high-resolution scene images (\"data level\")\nand suffer from the expensive computation arising from the required multi-scale\naggregation(\"network level\"). In both folds, the computational and energy costs\nin training and inference are notable due to the often desired large input\nresolutions and heavy computational burden of segmentation models. To this end,\nwe propose DANCE, general automated DAta-Network Co-optimization for Efficient\nsegmentation model training and inference. Distinct from existing efficient\nsegmentation approaches that focus merely on light-weight network design, DANCE\ndistinguishes itself as an automated simultaneous data-network co-optimization\nvia both input data manipulation and network architecture slimming.\nSpecifically, DANCE integrates automated data slimming which adaptively\ndownsamples/drops input images and controls their corresponding contribution to\nthe training loss guided by the images' spatial complexity. Such a downsampling\noperation, in addition to slimming down the cost associated with the input size\ndirectly, also shrinks the dynamic range of input object and context scales,\ntherefore motivating us to also adaptively slim the network to match the\ndownsampled data. Extensive experiments and ablating studies (on four SOTA\nsegmentation models with three popular segmentation datasets under two training\nsettings) demonstrate that DANCE can achieve \"all-win\" towards efficient\nsegmentation(reduced training cost, less expensive inference, and better mean\nIntersection-over-Union (mIoU)).",

    "abstract": "Clustering single-cell RNA sequence (scRNA-seq) data poses statistical and\ncomputational challenges due to their high-dimensionality and data-sparsity,\nalso known as `dropout' events. Recently, Regularized Auto-Encoder (RAE) based\ndeep neural network models have achieved remarkable success in learning robust\nlow-dimensional representations. The basic idea in RAEs is to learn a\nnon-linear mapping from the high-dimensional data space to a low-dimensional\nlatent space and vice-versa, simultaneously imposing a distributional prior on\nthe latent space, which brings in a regularization effect. This paper argues\nthat RAEs suffer from the infamous problem of bias-variance trade-off in their\nnaive formulation. While a simple AE without a latent regularization results in\ndata over-fitting, a very strong prior leads to under-representation and thus\nbad clustering. To address the above issues, we propose a modified RAE\nframework (called the scRAE) for effective clustering of the single-cell RNA\nsequencing data. scRAE consists of deterministic AE with a flexibly learnable\nprior generator network, which is jointly trained with the AE. This facilitates\nscRAE to trade-off better between the bias and variance in the latent space.

We work with models which are object-centric,\ni.e., explicitly work with object representations, and propagate a loss in the\nlatent space. Specifically, our research builds on recent work by Kipf et al.\n\\cite{kipf&al20}, which predicts the next state via contrastive learning of\nobject interactions in a latent space using a Graph Neural Network. We argue\nthat injecting explicit inductive bias in the model, in form of general\nphysical laws, can help not only make the model more interpretable, but also\nimprove the overall prediction of model. As a natural by-product, our model can\nlearn feature maps which closely resemble actual object positions in the image,\nwithout having any explicit supervision about the object positions at the\ntraining time. In comparison with earlier works \\cite{jaques&al20}, which\nassume a complete knowledge of the dynamics governing the motion in the form of\na physics engine, we rely only on the knowledge of general physical laws, such\nas, world consists of objects, which have position and velocity. We propose an\nadditional decoder based loss in the pixel space, imposed in a curriculum\nmanner, to further refine the latent space predictions. Experiments in multiple\ndifferent settings demonstrate that while Kipf et al. model is effective at\ncapturing object interactions, our model can be significantly more effective at\nlocalising objects, resulting in improved performance in 3 out of 4 domains\nthat we experiment with.

Such systems may suffer from the cold-start\nproblem: supervised models work well but, initially, there are no labels, which\nare costly or slow to obtain. This problem is even worse in imbalanced data\nscenarios. Online financial fraud detection is an example where labeling is: i)\nexpensive, or ii) it suffers from long delays, if relying on victims filing\ncomplaints. The latter may not be viable if a model has to be in place\nimmediately, so an option is to ask analysts to label events while minimizing\nthe number of annotations to control costs. We propose an Active Learning (AL)\nannotation system for datasets with orders of magnitude of class imbalance, in\na cold start streaming scenario.

We first tackle the buyer's bidding\nproblem subject to both budget and ROI constraints in repeated second-price\nauctions. We show that the optimal buyer hindsight policy admits a\n\"threshold-based\" structure that suggests the buyer win all auctions during\nwhich her valuation-to-expenditure ratio is greater than some threshold.

Next, we study the seller's pricing problem against\nan ROI and budget constrained buyer. We establish that the seller's revenue\nfunction admits a bell-shaped structure, and then further propose a pricing\nalgorithm that utilizes an episodic binary-search procedure to identify a\nrevenue-optimal selling price. During each binary search episode, our pricing\nalgorithm explores a particular price, allowing the buyer's learning algorithm\nto adapt and stabilize quickly.

    "abstract": "As an essential element for the diagnosis and rehabilitation of psychiatric\ndisorders, the electroencephalogram (EEG) based emotion recognition has\nachieved significant progress due to its high precision and reliability.\nHowever, one obstacle to practicality lies in the variability between subjects\nand sessions. Although several studies have adopted domain adaptation (DA)\napproaches to tackle this problem, most of them treat multiple EEG data from\ndifferent subjects and sessions together as a single source domain for\ntransfer, which either fails to satisfy the assumption of domain adaptation\nthat the source has a certain marginal distribution, or increases the\ndifficulty of adaptation. We therefore propose the multi-source marginal\ndistribution adaptation (MS-MDA) for EEG emotion recognition, which takes both\ndomain-invariant and domain-specific features into consideration. First, we\nassume that different EEG data share the same low-level features, then we\nconstruct independent branches for multiple EEG data source domains to adopt\none-to-one domain adaptation and extract domain-specific features. Finally, the\ninference is made by multiple branches. We evaluate our method on SEED and\nSEED-IV for recognizing three and four emotions, respectively. Experimental\nresults show that the MS-MDA outperforms the comparison methods and\nstate-of-the-art models in cross-session and cross-subject transfer scenarios\nin our settings.

    "abstract": "Not all examples are created equal, but standard deep neural network training\nprotocols treat each training point uniformly. Each example is propagated\nforward and backward through the network the same amount of times, independent\nof how much the example contributes to the learning protocol. Recent work has\nproposed ways to accelerate training by deviating from this uniform treatment.\nPopular methods entail up-weighting examples that contribute more to the loss\nwith the intuition that examples with low loss have already been learned by the\nmodel, so their marginal value to the training procedure should be lower. This\nview assumes that updating the model with high loss examples will be beneficial\nto the model. However, this may not hold for noisy, real world data. In this\npaper, we theorize and then empirically demonstrate that loss-based\nacceleration methods degrade in scenarios with noisy and corrupted data. Our\nwork suggests measures of example difficulty need to correctly separate out\nnoise from other types of challenging examples.",

    "abstract": "Few-Shot image classification aims to utilize pretrained knowledge learned\nfrom a large-scale dataset to tackle a series of downstream classification\ntasks. Typically, each task involves only few training examples from brand-new\ncategories. This requires the pretraining models to focus on well-generalizable\nknowledge, but ignore domain-specific information. In this paper, we observe\nthat image background serves as a source of domain-specific knowledge, which is\na shortcut for models to learn in the source dataset, but is harmful when\nadapting to brand-new classes. To prevent the model from learning this shortcut\nknowledge, we propose COSOC, a novel Few-Shot Learning framework, to\nautomatically figure out foreground objects at both pretraining and evaluation\nstage. COSOC is a two-stage algorithm motivated by the observation that\nforeground objects from different images within the same class share more\nsimilar patterns than backgrounds. At the pretraining stage, for each class, we\ncluster contrastive-pretrained features of randomly cropped image patches, such\nthat crops containing only foreground objects can be identified by a single\ncluster. We then force the pretraining model to focus on found foreground\nobjects by a fusion sampling strategy; at the evaluation stage, among images in\neach training class of any few-shot task, we seek for shared contents and\nfilter out background. The recognized foreground objects of each class are used\nto match foreground of testing images. Extensive experiments tailored to\ninductive FSL tasks on two benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art\nperformance of our method.",

Through this view, we find a\nsurprising result for homophily values that applies with only minimal\nassumptions on the graph topology. It can be phrased most simply as \"in a graph\nof red and blue nodes, red friends of red nodes are on average more homophilous\nthan red friends of blue nodes.\" This gap in averages defies simple intuitive\nexplanations, applies to globally heterophilous and homophilous networks and is\nreminiscent of but structurally distinct from the Friendship Paradox.

The\nstate-of-the-art work automatically models unknown peripherals by observing\ntheir access patterns, and then leverages heuristics to calculate the\nappropriate responses when unknown peripheral registers are accessed. However,\nwe empirically found that this approach and the corresponding heuristics are\nfrequently insufficient to emulate firmware.

Unlike\nexisting work that attempts to build a general model for each peripheral, our\napproach learns how to correctly emulate firmware execution at individual\nperipheral access points. It takes the image as input and symbolically executes\nit by representing unknown peripheral registers as symbols. During symbolic\nexecution, it infers the rules to respond to unknown peripheral accesses. These\nrules are stored in a knowledge base, which is referred to during the dynamic\nfirmware analysis. uEmu achieved a passing rate of 95% in a set of unit tests\nfor peripheral drivers without any manual assistance.

    "abstract": "Dense retrieval conducts text retrieval in the embedding space and has shown\nmany advantages compared to sparse retrieval. Existing dense retrievers\noptimize representations of queries and documents with contrastive training and\nmap them to the embedding space. The embedding space is optimized by aligning\nthe matched query-document pairs and pushing the negative documents away from\nthe query. However, in such training paradigm, the queries are only optimized\nto align to the documents and are coarsely positioned, leading to an\nanisotropic query embedding space. In this paper, we analyze the embedding\nspace distributions and propose an effective training paradigm, Contrastive\nDual Learning for Approximate Nearest Neighbor (DANCE) to learn fine-grained\nquery representations for dense retrieval. DANCE incorporates an additional\ndual training object of query retrieval, inspired by the classic information\nretrieval training axiom, query likelihood. With contrastive learning, the dual\ntraining object of DANCE learns more tailored representations for queries and\ndocuments to keep the embedding space smooth and uniform, thriving on the\nranking performance of DANCE on the MS MARCO document retrieval task. Different\nfrom ANCE that only optimized with the document retrieval task, DANCE\nconcentrates the query embeddings closer to document representations while\nmaking the document distribution more discriminative. Such concentrated query\nembedding distribution assigns more uniform negative sampling probabilities to\nqueries and helps to sufficiently optimize query representations in the query\nretrieval task.

Based on policy iteration, a novel\noff-policy reinforcement learning algorithm, named optimistic\nleast-squares-based policy iteration, is proposed which is able to iteratively\nfind near-optimal policies of the optimal stationary control problem directly\nfrom input/state data without explicitly identifying any system matrices,\nstarting from an initial admissible control policy. The solutions given by the\nproposed optimistic least-squares-based policy iteration are proved to converge\nto a small neighborhood of the optimal solution with probability one, under\nmild conditions. The application of the proposed algorithm to a triple inverted\npendulum example validates its feasibility and effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a unified computational framework for the estimation of\ndistances, geodesics and barycenters of merge trees. We extend recent work on\nthe edit distance [106] and introduce a new metric, called the Wasserstein\ndistance between merge trees, which is purposely designed to enable efficient\ncomputations of geodesics and barycenters. Specifically, our new distance is\nstrictly equivalent to the L2-Wasserstein distance between extremum persistence\ndiagrams, but it is restricted to a smaller solution space, namely, the space\nof rooted partial isomorphisms between branch decomposition trees. This enables\na simple extension of existing optimization frameworks [112] for geodesics and\nbarycenters from persistence diagrams to merge trees. We introduce a task-based\nalgorithm which can be generically applied to distance, geodesic, barycenter or\ncluster computation. The task-based nature of our approach enables further\naccelerations with shared-memory parallelism. Extensive experiments on public\nensembles and SciVis contest benchmarks demonstrate the efficiency of our\napproach -- with barycenter computations in the orders of minutes for the\nlargest examples -- as well as its qualitative ability to generate\nrepresentative barycenter merge trees, visually summarizing the features of\ninterest found in the ensemble. We show the utility of our contributions with\ndedicated visualization applications: feature tracking, temporal reduction and\nensemble clustering. We provide a lightweight C++ implementation that can be\nused to reproduce our results.",

We focus on the case where the input and the queries are\none-dimensional polygonal curves -- also called time series -- and we give a\ncomprehensive analysis for this case. We obtain new upper bounds that provide\ndifferent tradeoffs between approximation factor, preprocessing time, and query\ntime.\nOur data structures improve upon the state of the art in several ways. We\nshow that for any $0 < \\varepsilon \\leq 1$ an approximation factor of\n$(1+\\varepsilon)$ can be achieved within the same asymptotic time bounds as the\npreviously best result for $(2+\\varepsilon)$. Moreover, we show that an\napproximation factor of $(2+\\varepsilon)$ can be obtained by using\npreprocessing time and space $O(nm)$, which is linear in the input size, and\nquery time in $O(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon})^{k+2}$, where the previously best\nresult used preprocessing time in $n \\cdot O(\\frac{m}{\\varepsilon k})^k$ and\nquery time in $O(1)^k$. We complement our upper bounds with matching\nconditional lower bounds based on the Orthogonal Vectors Hypothesis.\nInterestingly, some of our lower bounds already hold for any super-constant\nvalue of $k$.

    "abstract": "Graph convolutional networks have significantly improved 3D human pose\nestimation by representing the human skeleton as an undirected graph. However,\nthis representation fails to reflect the articulated characteristic of human\nskeletons as the hierarchical orders among the joints are not explicitly\npresented. In this paper, we propose to represent the human skeleton as a\ndirected graph with the joints as nodes and bones as edges that are directed\nfrom parent joints to child joints. By so doing, the directions of edges can\nexplicitly reflect the hierarchical relationships among the nodes. Based on\nthis representation, we adopt the spatial-temporal directed graph convolution\n(ST-DGConv) to extract features from 2D poses represented in a temporal\nsequence of directed graphs. We further propose a spatial-temporal conditional\ndirected graph convolution (ST-CondDGConv) to leverage varying non-local\ndependence for different poses by conditioning the graph topology on input\nposes. Altogether, we form a U-shaped network with ST-DGConv and ST-CondDGConv\nlayers, named U-shaped Conditional Directed Graph Convolutional Network\n(U-CondDGCN), for 3D human pose estimation from monocular videos. To evaluate\nthe effectiveness of our U-CondDGCN, we conducted extensive experiments on two\nchallenging large-scale benchmarks: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Both\nquantitative and qualitative results show that our method achieves top\nperformance. Also, ablation studies show that directed graphs can better\nexploit the hierarchy of articulated human skeletons than undirected graphs,\nand the conditional connections can yield adaptive graph topologies for\ndifferent kinds of poses.",

A processor has two available states: a \\emph{sleep state} where no\nenergy is consumed but also no processing can take place, and an \\emph{active\nstate} which consumes energy at a rate of one, and in which jobs can be\nprocessed. Transitioning from the active to the sleep does not incur any\nfurther energy cost, but transitioning from the sleep to the active state\nrequires $q$ energy units. Jobs may be preempted and (in the multi-processor\ncase) migrated.\nThe single-processor case of the problem is known to be solvable in\npolynomial time via an involved dynamic program, whereas the only known\napproximation algorithm for the multi-processor case attains an approximation\nfactor of $3$ and is based on rounding the solution to a linear programming\nrelaxation of the problem. In this work, we present efficient and combinatorial\napproximation algorithms for both the single- and the multi-processor setting.\nBefore, only an algorithm based on linear programming was known for the\nmulti-processor case.

Finally, we further demonstrate the power of skeletons by providing\nan $2$-approximation algorithm for the multiprocessor case, thus improving upon\nthe recent breakthrough $3$-approximation result.

    "title": "A Theoretical Analysis of Granulometry-based Roughness Measures on  Cartosat DEMs",
    "abstract": "The study of water bodies such as rivers is an important problem in the\nremote sensing community. A meaningful set of quantitative features reflecting\nthe geophysical properties help us better understand the formation and\nevolution of rivers. Typically, river sub-basins are analysed using Cartosat\nDigital Elevation Models (DEMs), obtained at regular time epochs. One of the\nuseful geophysical features of a river sub-basin is that of a roughness measure\non DEMs. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is not much literature\navailable on theoretical analysis of roughness measures. In this article, we\nrevisit the roughness measure on DEM data adapted from multiscale\ngranulometries in mathematical morphology, namely multiscale directional\ngranulometric index (MDGI). This measure was classically used to obtain\nshape-size analysis in greyscale images. In earlier works, MDGIs were\nintroduced to capture the characteristic surficial roughness of a river\nsub-basin along specific directions. Also, MDGIs can be efficiently computed\nand are known to be useful features for classification of river sub-basins. In\nthis article, we provide a theoretical analysis of a MDGI. In particular, we\ncharacterize non-trivial sufficient conditions on the structure of DEMs under\nwhich MDGIs are invariant. These properties are illustrated with some\nfictitious DEMs. We also provide connections to a discrete derivative of volume\nof a DEM. Based on these connections, we provide intuition as to why a MDGI is\nconsidered a roughness measure. Further, we experimentally illustrate on\nLower-Indus, Wardha, and Barmer river sub-basins that the proposed features\ncapture the characteristics of the river sub-basin.",

    "abstract": "User intention which often changes dynamically is considered to be an\nimportant factor for modeling users in the design of recommendation systems.\nRecent studies are starting to focus on predicting user intention (what users\nwant) beyond user preference (what users like). In this work, a user intention\nmodel is proposed based on deep sequential topic analysis. The model predicts a\nuser's intention in terms of the topic of interest. The Hybrid Topic Model\n(HTM) comprising Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Word2Vec is proposed to\nderive the topic of interest of users and the history of preferences. HTM finds\nthe true topics of papers estimating word-topic distribution which includes\nsyntactic and semantic correlations among words. Next, to model user intention,\na Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based sequential deep learning model is\nproposed. This model takes into account temporal context, namely the time\ndifference between clicks of two consecutive papers seen by a user. Extensive\nexperiments with the real-world research paper dataset indicate that the\nproposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.\nFurther, the proposed approach introduces a new road map to model a user\nactivity suitable for the design of a research paper recommendation system.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the accuracy and robustness of car-following (CF) and\nadaptive cruise control (ACC) models used to simulate measured driving\nbehaviour of commercial ACCs. To this aim, a general modelling framework is\nproposed, in which ACC and CF models have been incrementally augmented with\nphysics extensions; namely, perception delay, linear or nonlinear vehicle\ndynamics, and acceleration constraints. The framework has been applied to the\nIntelligent Driver Model (IDM), the Gipps model, and to three basic ACCs. These\nare a linear controller coupled with a constant time-headway spacing policy and\nwith two other policies derived from the traffic flow theory, which are the IDM\ndesired-distance function and the Gipps equilibrium distance-speed function.\nThe ninety models resulting from the combination of the five base models and\nthe aforementioned physics extensions, have been assessed and compared through\na vast calibration and validation experiment against measured trajectory data\nof low-level automated vehicles. When a single extension has been applied,\nperception delay and linear dynamics have been the extensions to mostly\nincrease modelling accuracy, whatsoever the base model considered. Concerning\nmodels, Gipps-based ones have outperformed all other CF and ACC models in\ncalibration. Even among ACCs, the linear controllers coupled with a Gipps\nspacing policy have been the best performing. On the other hand, IDM-based\nmodels have been by far the most robust in validation, showing almost no crash\nwhen calibrated parameters have been used to simulate different trajectories.\nOverall, the paper shows the importance of cross-fertilization between traffic\nflow and vehicle studies.",

    "abstract": "To solve the issue of video dehazing, there are two main tasks to attain: how\nto align adjacent frames to the reference frame; how to restore the reference\nframe. Some papers adopt explicit approaches (e.g., the Markov random field,\noptical flow, deformable convolution, 3D convolution) to align neighboring\nframes with the reference frame in feature space or image space, they then use\nvarious restoration methods to achieve the final dehazing results. In this\npaper, we propose a progressive alignment and restoration method for video\ndehazing. The alignment process aligns consecutive neighboring frames stage by\nstage without using the optical flow estimation. The restoration process is not\nonly implemented under the alignment process but also uses a refinement network\nto improve the dehazing performance of the whole network. The proposed networks\ninclude four fusion networks and one refinement network. To decrease the\nparameters of networks, three fusion networks in the first fusion stage share\nthe same parameters.

    "abstract": "We study two-pass streaming algorithms for \\textsf{Maximum Bipartite\nMatching} (\\textsf{MBM}). All known two-pass streaming algorithms for\n\\textsf{MBM} operate in a similar fashion: They compute a maximal matching in\nthe first pass and find 3-augmenting paths in the second in order to augment\nthe matching found in the first pass. Our aim is to explore the limitations of\nthis approach and to determine whether current techniques can be used to\nfurther improve the state-of-the-art algorithms. We give the following results:\nWe show that every two-pass streaming algorithm that solely computes a\nmaximal matching in the first pass and outputs a $(2/3+\\epsilon)$-approximation\nrequires $n^{1+\\Omega(\\frac{1}{\\log \\log n})}$ space, for every $\\epsilon > 0$,\nwhere $n$ is the number of vertices of the input graph. This result is obtained\nby extending the Ruzsa-Szemer\\'{e}di graph construction of [GKK, SODA'12] so as\nto ensure that the resulting graph has a close to perfect matching, the key\nproperty needed in our construction. This result may be of independent\ninterest.\nFurthermore, we combine the two main techniques, i.e., subsampling followed\nby the \\textsc{Greedy} matching algorithm [Konrad, MFCS'18] which gives a\n$2-\\sqrt{2} \\approx 0.5857$-approximation, and the computation of\n\\emph{degree-bounded semi-matchings} [EHM, ICDMW'16][KT, APPROX'17] which gives\na $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{12} \\approx 0.5833$-approximation, and obtain a\nmeta-algorithm that yields Konrad's and Esfandiari et al.'s algorithms as\nspecial cases. This unifies two strands of research. By optimizing parameters,\nwe discover that Konrad's algorithm is optimal for the implied class of\nalgorithms and, perhaps surprisingly, that there is a second optimal algorithm.\nWe show that the analysis of our meta-algorithm is best possible.

The design of locomotion control is, however, still challenging.\nCurrently, controllers must be either manually designed for specific robots and\ntasks, or automatically designed via machine learning methods that require long\ntraining times and yield large opaque controllers. Drawing inspiration from\nanimal locomotion, we propose a simple yet versatile modular neural control\nstructure with fast learning. The key advantages of our approach are that\nbehavior-specific control modules can be added incrementally to obtain\nincreasingly complex emergent locomotion behaviors, and that neural connections\ninterfacing with existing modules can be quickly and automatically learned. In\na series of experiments, we show how eight modules can be quickly learned and\nadded to a base control module to obtain emergent adaptive behaviors allowing a\nhexapod robot to navigate in complex environments. We also show that modules\ncan be added and removed during operation without affecting the functionality\nof the remaining controller. Finally, the control approach was successfully\ndemonstrated on a physical hexapod robot.

For instance, with a baby seat on the\nrear, the driver might leave more space on one side to be able to get the baby\nout easily; or when grocery shopping, s/he may position the vehicle to remain\nthe trunk accessible. Autonomous vehicles are becoming technically effective at\ndriving from A to B and parking in a proper spot, with a default way. However,\nin order to satisfy users' expectations and to become trustworthy, they will\nalso need to park or make a temporary stop, appropriate to the given situation.\nIn addition, users want to understand better the capabilities of their driving\nassistance features, such as automated parking systems. A voice-based interface\ncan help with this and even ease the adoption of these features. Therefore, we\ndeveloped a voice-based in-car assistant (Park4U Mate), that is aware of\ninterior and exterior contexts (thanks to a variety of sensors), and that is\nable to park autonomously in a smart way (with a constraints minimization\nstrategy). The solution was demonstrated to thirty-five users in test-drives\nand their feedback was collected on the system's decision-making capability as\nwell as on the human-machine-interaction. The results show that: (1) the\nproposed optimization algorithm is efficient at deciding the best parking\nstrategy; hence, autonomous vehicles can adopt it; (2) a voice-based digital\nassistant for autonomous parking is perceived as a clear and effective\ninteraction method.

Measuring\ninter-cluster reliability is crucial as it directly affects how well\ninter-cluster tasks (e.g., identifying cluster relationships in the original\nspace from a projected view) can be conducted; however, despite the importance\nof inter-cluster tasks, we found that previous metrics, such as Trustworthiness\nand Continuity, fail to measure inter-cluster reliability. Our metrics consider\ntwo aspects of the inter-cluster reliability: Steadiness measures the extent to\nwhich clusters in the projected space form clusters in the original space, and\nCohesiveness measures the opposite. They extract random clusters with arbitrary\nshapes and positions in one space and evaluate how much the clusters are\nstretched or dispersed in the other space. Furthermore, our metrics can\nquantify pointwise distortions, allowing for the visualization of inter-cluster\nreliability in a projection, which we call a reliability map. Through\nquantitative experiments, we verify that our metrics precisely capture the\ndistortions that harm inter-cluster reliability while previous metrics have\ndifficulty capturing the distortions. A case study also demonstrates that our\nmetrics and the reliability map 1) support users in selecting the proper\nprojection techniques or hyperparameters and 2) prevent misinterpretation while\nperforming inter-cluster tasks, thus allow an adequate identification of\ninter-cluster structure.",

A very important special case is the\nlikelihood function $f\\left( A \\right ) = \\log{\\left( \\left| a_{ij}\\right|\n+1\\right)}$. A natural way to do this would be to simply apply $f$ to each\nentry of $A$, and then compute the matrix decomposition, but this requires\nstoring all of $A$ as well as multiple passes over its entries. Recent work of\nLiang et al.\\ shows how to find a rank-$k$ factorization to $f(A)$ for an $n\n\\times n$ matrix $A$ using only $n \\cdot \\operatorname{poly}(\\epsilon^{-1}k\\log\nn)$ words of memory, with overall error $10\\|f(A)-[f(A)]_k\\|_F^2 +\n\\operatorname{poly}(\\epsilon/k) \\|f(A)\\|_{1,2}^2$, where $[f(A)]_k$ is the best\nrank-$k$ approximation to $f(A)$ and $\\|f(A)\\|_{1,2}^2$ is the square of the\nsum of Euclidean lengths of rows of $f(A)$. Their algorithm uses three passes\nover the entries of $A$. The authors pose the open question of obtaining an\nalgorithm with $n \\cdot \\operatorname{poly}(\\epsilon^{-1}k\\log n)$ words of\nmemory using only a single pass over the entries of $A$. In this paper we\nresolve this open question, obtaining the first single-pass algorithm for this\nproblem and for the same class of functions $f$ studied by Liang et al.\nMoreover, our error is $\\|f(A)-[f(A)]_k\\|_F^2 + \\operatorname{poly}(\\epsilon/k)\n\\|f(A)\\|_F^2$, where $\\|f(A)\\|_F^2$ is the sum of squares of Euclidean lengths\nof rows of $f(A)$.

    "title": "Dark Patterns in Online Shopping: Of Sneaky Tricks, Perceived Annoyance  and Respective Brand Trust",
    "abstract": "Dark patterns utilize interface elements to trick users into performing\nunwanted actions. Online shopping websites often employ these manipulative\nmechanisms so as to increase their potential customer base, to boost their\nsales, or to optimize their advertising efforts. Although dark patterns are\noften successful, they clearly inhibit positive user experiences. Particularly,\nwith respect to customers' perceived annoyance and trust put into a given\nbrand, they may have negative effects. To investigate respective connections\nbetween the use of dark patterns, users' perceived level of annoyance and their\nexpressed brand trust, we conducted an experiment-based survey. We implemented\ntwo versions of a fictitious online shop; i.e. one which used five different\ntypes of dark patterns and a similar one without such manipulative user\ninterface elements. A total of $n=204$ participants were then forwarded to one\nof the two shops (approx. $2/3$ to the shop which used the dark patterns) and\nasked to buy a specific product. Subsequently, we measured participants'\nperceived annoyance level, their expressed brand trust and their affinity for\ntechnology. Results show a higher level of perceived annoyance with those who\nused the dark pattern version of the online shop. Also, we found a significant\nconnection between perceived annoyance and participants' expressed brand trust.\nA connection between participants' affinity for technology and their ability to\nrecognize and consequently counter dark patterns, however, is not supported by\nour data.",

    "abstract": "This paper discusses linearized models of hydropower plants (HPPs). First, it\nreviews state-of-the-art models and discusses their non-linearities, then it\nproposes suitable linearization strategies for the plant head, discharge, and\nturbine torque. It is shown that neglecting the dependency of the hydroacoustic\nresistance on the discharge leads to a linear formulation of the hydraulic\ncircuits model. For the turbine, a numerical linearization based on a\nfirst-order Taylor expansion is proposed. Model performance is evaluated for a\nmedium- and a low-head HPP with a Francis and Kaplan turbine, respectively.\nPerspective applications of these linear models are in the context of efficient\nmodel predictive control of HPPs based on convex optimization.",

    "abstract": "Reliable perception and efficient adaptation to novel conditions are priority\nskills for humanoids that function in dynamic environments. The vast\nadvancements in latest computer vision research, brought by deep learning\nmethods, are appealing for the robotics community. However, their adoption in\napplied domains is not straightforward since adapting them to new tasks is\nstrongly demanding in terms of annotated data and optimization time.\nNevertheless, robotic platforms, and especially humanoids, present\nopportunities (such as additional sensors and the chance to explore the\nenvironment) that can be exploited to overcome these issues. In this paper, we\npresent a pipeline for efficiently training an object detection system on a\nhumanoid robot. The proposed system allows to iteratively adapt an object\ndetection model to novel scenarios, by exploiting: (i) a teacher-learner\npipeline, (ii) weakly supervised learning techniques to reduce the human\nlabeling effort and (iii) an on-line learning approach for fast model\nre-training. We use the R1 humanoid robot for both testing the proposed\npipeline in a real-time application and acquire sequences of images to\nbenchmark the method.

    "abstract": "Multilingual language models have been a crucial breakthrough as they\nconsiderably reduce the need of data for under-resourced languages.\nNevertheless, the superiority of language-specific models has already been\nproven for languages having access to large amounts of data. In this work, we\nfocus on Catalan with the aim to explore to what extent a medium-sized\nmonolingual language model is competitive with state-of-the-art large\nmultilingual models. For this, we: (1) build a clean, high-quality textual\nCatalan corpus (CaText), the largest to date (but only a fraction of the usual\nsize of the previous work in monolingual language models), (2) train a\nTransformer-based language model for Catalan (BERTa), and (3) devise a thorough\nevaluation in a diversity of settings, comprising a complete array of\ndownstream tasks, namely, Part of Speech Tagging, Named Entity Recognition and\nClassification, Text Classification, Question Answering, and Semantic Textual\nSimilarity, with most of the corresponding datasets being created ex novo. The\nresult is a new benchmark, the Catalan Language Understanding Benchmark (CLUB),\nwhich we publish as an open resource, together with the clean textual corpus,\nthe language model, and the cleaning pipeline.

CV systems highly depend on the data they are fed with and\ncan learn and amplify biases within such data. Thus, both the problems of\nunderstanding and discovering biases are of utmost importance. Yet, to date\nthere is no comprehensive survey on bias in visual datasets. To this end, this\nwork aims to: i) describe the biases that can affect visual datasets; ii)\nreview the literature on methods for bias discovery and quantification in\nvisual datasets; iii) discuss existing attempts to collect bias-aware visual\ndatasets. A key conclusion of our study is that the problem of bias discovery\nand quantification in visual datasets is still open and there is room for\nimprovement in terms of both methods and the range of biases that can be\naddressed; moreover, there is no such thing as a bias-free dataset, so\nscientists and practitioners must become aware of the biases in their datasets\nand make them explicit. To this end, we propose a checklist that can be used to\nspot different types of bias during visual dataset collection.",

However, applying DP to the NLP domain comes with\nunique challenges. The most successful previous methods use a generalization of\nDP for metric spaces, and apply the privatization by adding noise to inputs in\nthe metric space of word embeddings. However, these methods assume that one\nspecific distance measure is being used, ignore the density of the space around\nthe input, and assume the embeddings used have been trained on non-sensitive\ndata.\nIn this work we propose Truncated Exponential Mechanism (TEM), a general\nmethod that allows the privatization of words using any distance metric, on\nembeddings that can be trained on sensitive data. Our method makes use of the\nexponential mechanism to turn the privatization step into a \\emph{selection\nproblem}. This allows the noise applied to be calibrated to the density of the\nembedding space around the input, and makes domain adaptation possible for the\nembeddings.

To realize\nconsistent colorization, we propose here a semi-automatic colorization method\nbased on generative adversarial networks (GAN); the method learns the painting\nstyle of a specific comic from small amount of training data. The proposed\nmethod takes a pair of a screen tone image and a flat colored image as input,\nand outputs a colorized image. Experiments show that the proposed method\nachieves better performance than the existing alternatives.",

    "abstract": "Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns,\nsoftware engineers' daily life was disrupted and they were abruptly forced into\nworking remotely from home. Across one exploratory and one confirmatory study\n(N = 482), we tested whether a typical working day is different to pre-pandemic\ntimes and whether specific tasks are associated with task-specific satisfaction\nand productivity. To explore the subject domain, we first run a two-wave\nlongitudinal study, where we found that the time software engineers spent doing\nspecific tasks (e.g., coding, bugfixing, helping others) from home was similar\nto pre-pandemic times. Also, the amount of time developers spent on each task\nwas unrelated to their general well-being, perceived productivity, and other\nvariables such as basic needs. In our confirmatory study, we found that task\nsatisfaction and productivity are predicted by task-specific variables (e.g.,\nhow much autonomy software engineers had during coding) but not by\ntask-independent variables such as general resilience or a good work-life\nbalance. Additionally, we found that satisfaction and autonomy were\nsignificantly higher when software engineers were helping others and lower when\nthey were bugfixing. Also, contrary to anecdotal evidence, software engineers'\nsatisfaction and productivity during meetings is not lower compared to other\ntasks. Finally, we discuss implications for software engineers, management, and\nresearchers.",

    "abstract": "Learning effective language representations from crowdsourced labels is\ncrucial for many real-world machine learning tasks. A challenging aspect of\nthis problem is that the quality of crowdsourced labels suffer high intra- and\ninter-observer variability. Since the high-capacity deep neural networks can\neasily memorize all disagreements among crowdsourced labels, directly applying\nexisting supervised language representation learning algorithms may yield\nsuboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose \\emph{TACMA}, a\n\\underline{t}emporal-\\underline{a}ware language representation learning\nheuristic for \\underline{c}rowdsourced labels with \\underline{m}ultiple\n\\underline{a}nnotators.

A neuro-dynamical mechanism called conceptors\noffers a method for controlling the dynamics of a recurrent neural network by\nwhich a variety of temporal patterns can be learned and recalled. However,\nconceptors are matrices whose size scales quadratically with the number of\nneurons in the recurrent neural network, hence they quickly become impractical.\nIn the work reported in this thesis, a variation of conceptors is introduced,\ncalled diagonal conceptors, which are diagonal matrices, thus reducing the\ncomputational cost drastically. It will be shown that diagonal conceptors\nachieve the same accuracy as conceptors, but are slightly more unstable. This\ninstability can be improved, but requires further research.

Some fake news detection methods are already quite successful.\nNevertheless, there are still many vulnerabilities in the detection algorithms.\nThe reason for this is that fake news publishers can structure and formulate\ntheir texts in such a way that a detection algorithm does not expose this text\nas fake news. This paper shows that it is possible to automatically attack\nstate-of-the-art models that have been trained to detect Fake News, making\nthese vulnerable. For this purpose, corresponding models were first trained\nbased on a dataset. Then, using Text-Attack, an attempt was made to manipulate\nthe trained models in such a way that previously correctly identified fake news\nwas classified as true news. The results show that it is possible to\nautomatically bypass Fake News detection mechanisms, leading to implications\nconcerning existing policy initiatives.",

    "abstract": "Exploiting sparsity is a key technique in accelerating quantized\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) inference on mobile devices. Prior sparse\nCNN accelerators largely exploit un-structured sparsity and achieve significant\nspeedups. Due to the unbounded, largely unpredictable sparsity patterns,\nhowever, exploiting unstructured sparsity requires complicated hardware design\nwith significant energy and area overhead, which is particularly detrimental to\nmobile/IoT inference scenarios where energy and area efficiency are crucial. We\npropose to exploit structured sparsity, more specifically, Density Bound Block\n(DBB) sparsity for both weights and activations. DBB block tensors bound the\nmaximum number of non-zeros per block. DBB thus exposes statically predictable\nsparsity patterns that enable lean sparsity-exploiting hardware. We propose new\nhardware primitives to implement DBB sparsity for (static) weights and\n(dynamic) activations, respectively, with very low overheads. Building on top\nof the primitives, we describe S2TA, a systolic array-based CNN accelerator\nthat exploits joint weight and activation DBB sparsity and new dimensions of\ndata reuse unavailable on the traditional systolic array. S2TA in 16nm achieves\nmore than 2x speedup and energy reduction compared to a strong baseline of a\nsystolic array with zero-value clock gating, over five popular CNN benchmarks.\nCompared to two recent non-systolic sparse accelerators, Eyeriss v2 (65nm) and\nSparTen (45nm), S2TA in 65nm uses about 2.2x and 3.1x less energy per\ninference, respectively.",

For this purpose, two datasets were captured, one (480\nimages) under constant conditions, and a second one (200 images) under\ndifferent variations such as use of a duvet, sleeping with a pet, or increased\nroom temperature. We test three machine learning algorithms: Support Vector\nMachines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Neural Network (NN). With\n10-fold cross validation, the highest accuracy in the main dataset is for both\nSVM and k-NN (99%). The results with variable data show a lower reliability\nunder certain circumstances, highlighting the need of extra work to meet the\nchallenge of variations in the environment.",

To obtain better ternary codes, we for\nthe first time propose to jointly learn the features with the codes by\nappending a smoothed function to the networks. During training, the function\ncould evolve into a non-smoothed ternary function by a continuation method. The\nmethod circumvents the difficulty of directly training discrete functions and\nreduces the quantization errors of ternary codes.

    "abstract": "Multiple studies in the past have shown that there is a strong correlation\nbetween human vocal characteristics and facial features. However, existing\napproaches generate faces simply from voice, without exploring the set of\nfeatures that contribute to these observed correlations. A computational\nmethodology to explore this can be devised by rephrasing the question to: \"how\nmuch would a target face have to change in order to be perceived as the\noriginator of a source voice?\" With this in perspective, we propose a framework\nto morph a target face in response to a given voice in a way that facial\nfeatures are implicitly guided by learned voice-face correlation in this paper.\nOur framework includes a guided autoencoder that converts one face to another,\ncontrolled by a unique model-conditioning component called a gating controller\nwhich modifies the reconstructed face based on input voice recordings.

The goal of the paper is\ntwofold. Proposed by us Graph Kernel Attention Transformers (or GKATs) are much\nmore expressive than SOTA GNNs as capable of modeling longer-range dependencies\nwithin a single layer.

Furthermore, GKAT attention layers scale linearly rather than\nquadratically in the number of nodes of the input graphs, even when those\ngraphs are dense, requiring less compute than their regular graph attention\ncounterparts. They achieve it by applying new classes of graph kernels\nadmitting random feature map decomposition via random walks on graphs. As a\nbyproduct of the introduced techniques, we obtain a new class of learnable\ngraph sketches, called graphots, compactly encoding topological graph\nproperties as well as nodes' features.

Despite the popularity and\nusefulness of social media, there have been many instances where corrupted\nusers found ways to abuse it, as for instance, through raising or lowering\nuser's credibility. As a result, while social media facilitates an\nunprecedented ease of access to information, it also introduces a new challenge\n- that of ascertaining the credibility of shared information. Currently, there\nis no automated way of determining which news or users are credible and which\nare not. Hence, establishing a system that can measure the social media user's\ncredibility has become an issue of great importance. Assigning a credibility\nscore to a user has piqued the interest of not only the research community but\nalso most of the big players on both sides - such as Facebook, on the side of\nindustry, and political parties on the societal one. In this work, we created a\nmodel which, we hope, will ultimately facilitate and support the increase of\ntrust in the social network communities. Our model collected data and analysed\nthe behaviour of~50,000 politicians on Twitter. Influence score, based on\nseveral chosen features, was assigned to each evaluated user. Further, we\nclassified the political Twitter users as either trusted or untrusted using\nrandom forest, multilayer perceptron, and support vector machine.

We also\nperformed sensitivity analysis by defining the outcome as lactate change of\n>10% and furthermore investigated the influence of the time interval between\nsubsequent lactate measurements on predictive performance.\nResults. The LSTM models were able to predict deterioration of serum lactate\nvalues of MIMIC-III patients with an AUC of 0.77 (95% CI 0.762-0.771) for the\nnormal group, 0.77 (95% CI 0.768-0.772) for the mild group, and 0.85 (95% CI\n0.840-0.851) for the severe group, with a slightly lower performance in the\nexternal validation.\nConclusion. The LSTM demonstrated good discrimination of patients who had\ndeterioration in serum lactate levels. Clinical studies are needed to evaluate\nwhether utilization of a clinical decision support tool based on these results\ncould positively impact decision-making and patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Clustering and visualizing high-dimensional (HD) data are important tasks in\na variety of fields. For example, in bioinformatics, they are crucial for\nanalyses of single-cell data such as mass cytometry (CyTOF) data. Some of the\nmost effective algorithms for clustering HD data are based on representing the\ndata by nodes in a graph, with edges connecting neighbouring nodes according to\nsome measure of similarity or distance. However, users of graph-based\nalgorithms are typically faced with the critical but challenging task of\nchoosing the value of an input parameter that sets the size of neighbourhoods\nin the graph, e.g. the number of nearest neighbours to which to connect each\nnode or a threshold distance for connecting nodes. The burden on the user could\nbe alleviated by a measure of inter-node similarity that can have value 0 for\ndissimilar nodes without requiring any user-defined parameters or thresholds.\nThis would determine the neighbourhoods automatically while still yielding a\nsparse graph. To this end, I propose a new method called ASTRICS to measure\nsimilarity between clusters of HD data points based on local dimensionality\nreduction and triangulation of critical alpha shapes. I show that my ASTRICS\nsimilarity measure can facilitate both clustering and visualization of HD data\nby using it in Stage 2 of a three-stage pipeline: Stage 1 = perform an initial\nclustering of the data by any method; Stage 2 = let graph nodes represent\ninitial clusters instead of individual data points and use ASTRICS to\nautomatically define edges between nodes; Stage 3 = use the graph for further\nclustering and visualization. This trades the critical task of choosing a graph\nneighbourhood size for the easier task of essentially choosing a resolution at\nwhich to view the data. The graph and consequently downstream clustering and\nvisualization are then automatically adapted to the chosen resolution.",

Although\na phoneme classifier can be used for KWS, exploiting a large amount of\ntranscribed data for automatic speech recognition (ASR), there is a mismatch\nbetween the training criterion (phoneme recognition) and the target task (KWS).\nRecently, multi-task learning has been applied to KWS to exploit both ASR and\nKWS training data. In this approach, an output of an acoustic model is split\ninto two branches for the two tasks, one for phoneme transcription trained with\nthe ASR data and one for keyword classification trained with the KWS data. In\nthis paper, we introduce a cross attention decoder in the multi-task learning\nframework.

    "abstract": "Algorithmic recourse explanations inform stakeholders on how to act to revert\nunfavorable predictions. However, in general ML models do not predict well in\ninterventional distributions. Thus, an action that changes the prediction in\nthe desired way may not lead to an improvement of the underlying target. Such\nrecourse is neither meaningful nor robust to model refits. Extending the work\nof Karimi et al. (2021), we propose meaningful algorithmic recourse (MAR) that\nonly recommends actions that improve both prediction and target. We justify\nthis selection constraint by highlighting the differences between model audit\nand meaningful, actionable recourse explanations. Additionally, we introduce a\nrelaxation of MAR called effective algorithmic recourse (EAR), which, under\ncertain assumptions, yields meaningful recourse by only allowing interventions\non causes of the target.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance velocimetry (MRV) is a non-invasive experimental technique\nwidely used in medicine and engineering to measure the velocity field of a\nfluid. These measurements are dense but have a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).\nThe measurements can be de-noised by imposing physical constraints on the flow,\nwhich are encapsulated in governing equations for mass and momentum. Previous\nstudies have required the shape of the boundary (for example, a blood vessel)\nto be known a priori. This, however, requires a set of additional measurements,\nwhich can be expensive to obtain. In this paper, we present a physics-informed\nneural network that instead uses the noisy MRV data alone to simultaneously\ninfer the most likely boundary shape and de-noised velocity field. We achieve\nthis by training an auxiliary neural network that takes the value 1.0 within\nthe inferred domain of the governing PDE and 0.0 outside. This network is used\nto weight the PDE residual term in the loss function accordingly and implicitly\nlearns the geometry of the system. We test our algorithm by assimilating both\nsynthetic and real MRV measurements for flows that can be well modeled by the\nPoisson and Stokes equations. We find that we are able to reconstruct very\nnoisy (SNR = 2.5) MRV signals and recover the ground truth with low\nreconstruction errors of 3.7 - 7.5%. The simplicity and flexibility of our\nphysics-informed neural network approach can readily scale to assimilating MRV\ndata with complex 3D geometries, time-varying 4D data, or unknown parameters in\nthe physical model.",

    "abstract": "Recently, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have offered a powerful\nnew paradigm for solving problems relating to differential equations. Compared\nto classical numerical methods PINNs have several advantages, for example their\nability to provide mesh-free solutions of differential equations and their\nability to carry out forward and inverse modelling within the same optimisation\nproblem. Whilst promising, a key limitation to date is that PINNs have\nstruggled to accurately and efficiently solve problems with large domains\nand/or multi-scale solutions, which is crucial for their real-world\napplication. Multiple significant and related factors contribute to this issue,\nincluding the increasing complexity of the underlying PINN optimisation problem\nas the problem size grows and the spectral bias of neural networks. In this\nwork we propose a new, scalable approach for solving large problems relating to\ndifferential equations called Finite Basis PINNs (FBPINNs). FBPINNs are\ninspired by classical finite element methods, where the solution of the\ndifferential equation is expressed as the sum of a finite set of basis\nfunctions with compact support. In FBPINNs neural networks are used to learn\nthese basis functions, which are defined over small, overlapping subdomains.\nFBINNs are designed to address the spectral bias of neural networks by using\nseparate input normalisation over each subdomain, and reduce the complexity of\nthe underlying optimisation problem by using many smaller neural networks in a\nparallel divide-and-conquer approach. Our numerical experiments show that\nFBPINNs are effective in solving both small and larger, multi-scale problems,\noutperforming standard PINNs in both accuracy and computational resources\nrequired, potentially paving the way to the application of PINNs on large,\nreal-world problems.",

The\nFibrilNet tool is applied to high-resolution Halpha images from an active\nregion (AR 12665) collected by the 1.6 m Goode Solar Telescope (GST) equipped\nwith high-order adaptive optics at the Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO). We\nquantitatively assess the FibrilNet tool, comparing its image segmentation\nalgorithm and fibril-fitting algorithm with those employed by the\nthreshold-based tool. Our experimental results and major findings are\nsummarized as follows. First, the image segmentation results (i.e., detected\nfibrils) of the two tools are quite similar, demonstrating the good learning\ncapability of FibrilNet. Second, FibrilNet finds more accurate and smoother\nfibril orientation angles than the threshold-based tool. Third, FibrilNet is\nfaster than the threshold-based tool and the uncertainty maps produced by\nFibrilNet not only provide a quantitative way to measure the confidence on each\ndetected fibril, but also help identify fibril structures that are not detected\nby the threshold-based tool but are inferred through machine learning. Finally,\nwe apply FibrilNet to full-disk Halpha images from other solar observatories\nand additional high-resolution Halpha images collected by BBSO/GST,\ndemonstrating the tool's usability in diverse datasets.",

In this paper, we present a deep learning based iTM method that takes\nadvantage of the feature extraction and mapping power of deep convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) and uses a lightness prior to modulate the CNN to better\nexploit observations in the surrounding areas of the over-exposed regions to\nenhance the quality of HDR image reconstruction.

Our contribution eliminates\ntwo requirements of distillation methods: (i) paired image sets by using an\nimage to image (I2I) translation and (ii) pre-training of the teacher network\nwith a large training set by using concurrent training of all networks. Our\nframework uses an end-to-end trained unpaired I2I translation, teacher, and\nstudent segmentation networks. Our framework can be combined with any I2I and\nsegmentation network.

To this purpose, we introduce a novel multivariate\nautoregressive model to infer the graph topology encoded in the coefficient\nmatrix which captures the sparse Granger causality dependency structure present\nin such matrix-valued time series. We decompose the graph by imposing a\nKronecker sum structure on the coefficient matrix. We develop two online\napproaches to learn the graph in a recursive way.

    "title": "Testing Surrogate-Based Optimization with the Fortified Branin-Hoo  Extended to Four Dimensions",
    "abstract": "Some popular functions used to test global optimization algorithms have\nmultiple local optima, all with the same value, making them all global optima.\nIt is easy to make them more challenging by fortifying them via adding a\nlocalized bump at the location of one of the optima. In previous work the\nauthors illustrated this for the Branin-Hoo function and the popular\ndifferential evolution algorithm, showing that the fortified Branin-Hoo\nrequired an order of magnitude more function evaluations. This paper examines\nthe effect of fortifying the Branin-Hoo function on surrogate-based\noptimization, which usually proceeds by adaptive sampling. Two algorithms are\nconsidered. The EGO algorithm, which is based on a Gaussian process (GP) and an\nalgorithm based on radial basis functions (RBF). EGO is found to be more frugal\nin terms of the number of required function evaluations required to identify\nthe correct basin, but it is expensive to run on a desktop, limiting the number\nof times the runs could be repeated to establish sound statistics on the number\nof required function evaluations. The RBF algorithm was cheaper to run,\nproviding more sound statistics on performance. A four-dimensional version of\nthe Branin-Hoo function was introduced in order to assess the effect of\ndimensionality. It was found that the difference between the ordinary function\nand the fortified one was much more pronounced for the four-dimensional\nfunction compared to the two dimensional one.",

    "title": "The strong converse exponent of discriminating infinite-dimensional  quantum states",
    "abstract": "The sandwiched R\\'enyi divergences of two finite-dimensional density\noperators quantify their asymptotic distinguishability in the strong converse\ndomain. This establishes the sandwiched R\\'enyi divergences as the\noperationally relevant ones among the infinitely many quantum extensions of the\nclassical R\\'enyi divergences for R\\'enyi parameter $\\alpha>1$. The known proof\nof this goes by showing that the sandwiched R\\'enyi divergence coincides with\nthe regularized measured R\\'enyi divergence, which in turn is proved by\nasymptotic pinching, a fundamentally finite-dimensional technique. Thus, while\nthe notion of the sandwiched R\\'enyi divergences was extended recently to\ndensity operators on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space (in fact, even for\nstates of an arbitrary von Neumann algebra), these quantities were so far\nlacking an operational interpretation similar to the finite-dimensional case,\nand it has also been open whether they coincide with the regularized measured\nR\\'enyi divergences. In this paper we fill this gap by answering both questions\nin the positive for density operators on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space,\nusing a simple finite-dimensional approximation technique.\nWe also initiate the study of the sandwiched R\\'enyi divergences, and the\nrelated problems of the strong converse exponent, for pairs of positive\nsemi-definite operators that are not necessarily trace-class (this corresponds\nto considering weights in a general von Neumann algebra setting). While this\nproblem does not have an immediate operational relevance, it might be\ninteresting from the purely mathematical point of view of extending the concept\nof R\\'enyi (and other) divergences to settings beyond the standard one of\npositive trace-class operators (positive normal functionals in the von Neumann\nalgebra case).",
