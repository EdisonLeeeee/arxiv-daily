    "abstract": "Power device reliability is a major concern during operation under extreme\nenvironments, as doing so reduces the operational lifetime of any power system\nor sensing infrastructure. Due to a potential for system failure, devices must\nbe experimentally validated before implementation, which is expensive and\ntime-consuming. In this paper, we have utilized machine learning algorithms to\npredict device reliability, significantly reducing the need for conducting\nexperiments. To train the models, we have tested 224 power devices from 10\ndifferent manufacturers. First, we describe a method to process the data for\nmodeling purposes. Based on the in-house testing data, we implemented various\nML models and observed that computational models such as Gradient Boosting and\nLSTM encoder-decoder networks can predict power device failure with high\naccuracy.",

The proposed shape registration method achieves\nthree major advantages through combining equivariant feature learning with\nimplicit shape models. First, the necessity of data association is removed\nbecause of the permutation-invariant property in network architectures similar\nto PointNet. Second, the registration in feature space can be solved in\nclosed-form using Horn's method due to the SO(3)-equivariance property. Third,\nthe registration is robust to noise in the point cloud because of implicit\nshape learning.

In turn, there has been a\nsignificant amount of interest and research in trajectory forecasting,\nresulting in a wide variety of approaches. Common to all works, however, is the\nuse of the same few accuracy-based evaluation metrics, e.g., displacement error\nand log-likelihood. While these metrics are informative, they are task-agnostic\nand predictions that are evaluated as equal can lead to vastly different\noutcomes, e.g., in downstream planning and decision making. In this work, we\ntake a step back and critically evaluate current trajectory forecasting\nmetrics, proposing task-aware metrics as a better measure of performance in\nsystems where prediction is being deployed.

Herein, we introduce a dynamic RF combining architecture for ambient\nRF EH use cases, and exemplify the attainable performance gains via three\nsimple mechanisms, namely, brute force (BF), sequential testing (ST) and\ncodebook based (CB).

    "abstract": "Causality knowledge is vital to building robust AI systems. Deep learning\nmodels often perform poorly on tasks that require causal reasoning, which is\noften derived using some form of commonsense knowledge not immediately\navailable in the input but implicitly inferred by humans. Prior work has\nunraveled spurious observational biases that models fall prey to in the absence\nof causality. While language representation models preserve contextual\nknowledge within learned embeddings, they do not factor in causal relationships\nduring training. By blending causal relationships with the input features to an\nexisting model that performs visual cognition tasks (such as scene\nunderstanding, video captioning, video question-answering, etc.), better\nperformance can be achieved owing to the insight causal relationships bring\nabout. Recently, several models have been proposed that have tackled the task\nof mining causal data from either the visual or textual modality. However,\nthere does not exist widespread research that mines causal relationships by\njuxtaposing the visual and language modalities. While images offer a rich and\neasy-to-process resource for us to mine causality knowledge from, videos are\ndenser and consist of naturally time-ordered events. Also, textual information\noffers details that could be implicit in videos. We propose iReason, a\nframework that infers visual-semantic commonsense knowledge using both videos\nand natural language captions. Furthermore, iReason's architecture integrates a\ncausal rationalization module to aid the process of interpretability, error\nanalysis and bias detection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of iReason using\na two-pronged comparative analysis with language representation learning models\n(BERT, GPT-2) as well as current state-of-the-art multimodal causality models.",

But most research on adversarial ML has\nnot engaged in developing tools for resistance against ML systems. Why? In this\npaper, we review the broader impact statements that adversarial ML researchers\nwrote as part of their NeurIPS 2020 papers and assess the assumptions that\nauthors have about the goals of their work. We also collect information about\nhow authors view their work's impact more generally. We find that most\nadversarial ML researchers at NeurIPS hold two fundamental assumptions that\nwill make it difficult for them to consider socially beneficial uses of\nattacks: (1) it is desirable to make systems robust, independent of context,\nand (2) attackers of systems are normatively bad and defenders of systems are\nnormatively good. That is, despite their expressed and supposed neutrality,\nmost adversarial ML researchers believe that the goal of their work is to\nsecure systems, making it difficult to conceptualize and build tools for\ndisrupting the status quo.",

Despite its simplicity, the model reveals new insights when applied to\nreal-life examples.

We provide sufficient\nconditions under which the optimal mechanism can be implemented via upgrade\npricing -- a menu of product bundles that are nested in the strong set order.\nOur approach exploits duality methods to identify conditions on the\ndistribution of consumer types under which (a) each product is purchased by the\nsame set of buyers as under separate monopoly pricing (though the transfers can\nbe different), and (b) these sets are nested.\nWe exhibit two distinct sets of sufficient conditions. The first set of\nconditions is given by a weak version of monotonicity of types and virtual\nvalues, while maintaining a regularity assumption, i.e., that the\nproduct-by-product revenue curves are single-peaked. The second set of\nconditions establishes the optimality of upgrade pricing for type spaces with\nmonotone marginal rates of substitution (MRS) -- the relative preference ratios\nfor any two products are monotone across types. The monotone MRS condition\nallows us to relax the earlier regularity assumption.\nUnder both sets of conditions, we fully characterize the product bundles and\nprices that form the optimal upgrade pricing menu. Finally, we show that, if\nthe consumer's types are monotone, the seller can equivalently post a vector of\nsingle-item prices: upgrade pricing and separate pricing are equivalent.",

One of the challenging IE tasks is Event Extraction (EE)\nwhich seeks to derive information about specific incidents and their actors\nfrom the text. EE is useful in many domains such as building a knowledge base,\ninformation retrieval, summarization and online monitoring systems. In the past\ndecades, some event ontologies like ACE, CAMEO and ICEWS were developed to\ndefine event forms, actors and dimensions of events observed in the text. These\nevent ontologies still have some shortcomings such as covering only a few\ntopics like political events, having inflexible structure in defining argument\nroles, lack of analytical dimensions, and complexity in choosing event\nsub-types. To address these concerns, we propose an event ontology, namely\nCOfEE, that incorporates both expert domain knowledge, previous ontologies and\na data-driven approach for identifying events from text. COfEE consists of two\nhierarchy levels (event types and event sub-types) that include new categories\nrelating to environmental issues, cyberspace, criminal activity and natural\ndisasters which need to be monitored instantly. Also, dynamic roles according\nto each event sub-type are defined to capture various dimensions of events. In\na follow-up experiment, the proposed ontology is evaluated on Wikipedia events,\nand it is shown to be general and comprehensive.

The uncertainty propagation\nover a task-allocation process is done by using the Unscented transform that\nuses the Sigma-Point sampling mechanism. It has great potential to be employed\nfor generic task-allocation schemes, in the sense that there is no need to\nmodify an existing task-allocation method that has been developed without\nconsidering the uncertainty in the situational awareness. The proposed\nframework was tested in a simulated environment where the decision-maker needs\nto determine an optimal allocation of multiple locations assigned to multiple\nmobile flying robots whose locations come as random variables of known mean and\ncovariance. The simulation result shows that the proposed stochastic task\nallocation approach generates an assignment with 30% less overall cost than the\none without considering the uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "Background: In medical imaging, prior studies have demonstrated disparate AI\nperformance by race, yet there is no known correlation for race on medical\nimaging that would be obvious to the human expert interpreting the images.\nMethods: Using private and public datasets we evaluate: A) performance\nquantification of deep learning models to detect race from medical images,\nincluding the ability of these models to generalize to external environments\nand across multiple imaging modalities, B) assessment of possible confounding\nanatomic and phenotype population features, such as disease distribution and\nbody habitus as predictors of race, and C) investigation into the underlying\nmechanism by which AI models can recognize race.\nFindings: Standard deep learning models can be trained to predict race from\nmedical images with high performance across multiple imaging modalities. Our\nfindings hold under external validation conditions, as well as when models are\noptimized to perform clinically motivated tasks. We demonstrate this detection\nis not due to trivial proxies or imaging-related surrogate covariates for race,\nsuch as underlying disease distribution. Finally, we show that performance\npersists over all anatomical regions and frequency spectrum of the images\nsuggesting that mitigation efforts will be challenging and demand further\nstudy.\nInterpretation: We emphasize that model ability to predict self-reported race\nis itself not the issue of importance. However, our findings that AI can\ntrivially predict self-reported race -- even from corrupted, cropped, and\nnoised medical images -- in a setting where clinical experts cannot, creates an\nenormous risk for all model deployments in medical imaging: if an AI model\nsecretly used its knowledge of self-reported race to misclassify all Black\npatients, radiologists would not be able to tell using the same data the model\nhas access to.",

In classical CVRP, a customer location is modeled as a point.\nIn many robotics applications, however, it is more appropriate to model such\n\"customer locations\" as 2D regions. For example, in aerial delivery, a drone\nmay drop a package anywhere in a customer's lot. This yields the problem of\nCVRG (Capacitated Vehicle Routing with Target Geometric Constraints).\nComputationally, CVRP is already strongly NP-hard; CVRG is therefore more\nchallenging. Nevertheless, we develop fast algorithms for CVRG, capable of\ncomputing high quality solutions for hundreds of regions. Our algorithmic\nsolution is guaranteed to be optimal when customer regions are convex.\nNumerical evaluations show that our proposed methods significantly outperform\ngreedy best-first approaches.

    "abstract": "Adaptive methods are popular within the control literature due to the\nflexibility and forgiveness they offer in the area of modelling. Neural network\nadaptive control is favorable specifically for the powerful nature of the\nmachine learning algorithm to approximate unknown functions and for the ability\nto relax certain constraints within traditional adaptive control. Deep neural\nnetworks are large framework networks with vastly superior approximation\ncharacteristics than their shallow counterparts. However, implementing a deep\nneural network can be difficult due to size specific complications such as\nvanishing/exploding gradients in training. In this paper, a neuro-adaptive\ncontroller is implemented featuring a deep neural network trained on a new\nweight update law that escapes the vanishing/exploding gradient problem by only\nincorporating the sign of the gradient. The type of controller designed is an\nadaptive dynamic inversion controller utilizing a modified state observer in a\nsecondary estimation loop to train the network. The deep neural network learns\nthe entire plant model on-line, creating a controller that is completely model\nfree. The controller design is tested in simulation on a 2 link planar robot\narm. The controller is able to learn the nonlinear plant quickly and displays\ngood performance in the tracking control problem.",

In particular, datasets which\ncontain information revealing insights about human responses to the given music\nsamples are rare. The issue of scale persists as a general hindrance towards\nbreakthroughs in the field, while the lack of listener evaluation is especially\nrelevant to the generative modelling problem-space, where clear objective\nmetrics correlating strongly with qualitative success remain elusive.\nWe propose the JS Fake Chorales, a dataset of 500 pieces generated by a new\nlearning-based algorithm, provided in MIDI form. We take consecutive outputs\nfrom the algorithm and avoid cherry-picking in order to validate the potential\nto further scale this dataset on-demand. We conduct an online experiment for\nhuman evaluation, designed to be as fair to the listener as possible, and find\nthat respondents were on average only 7\\% better than random guessing at\ndistinguishing JS Fake Chorales from real chorales composed by JS Bach.\nFurthermore, we make anonymised data collected from experiments available along\nwith the MIDI samples, such as the respondents' musical experience and how long\nthey took to submit their response for each sample. Finally, we conduct\nablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of using the synthetic pieces\nfor research in polyphonic music modelling, and find that we can improve on\nstate-of-the-art validation set loss for the canonical JSB Chorales dataset,\nusing a known algorithm, by simply augmenting the training set with the JS Fake\nChorales.",

To evaluate the effectiveness of TCK as a kernel, we\napplied several dimensionality reduction techniques for visualization and\nclassification tasks. The experimental results show that TCK allows identifying\na group of patients that acquire the AMR during the first 48 hours of their ICU\nstay, and it also provides good classification capabilities.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of early diagnostic technologies, including self-monitoring\nsystems and wearables, coupled with the application of these technologies on\nlarge segments of healthy populations may significantly aggravate the problem\nof overdiagnosis. This can lead to unwanted consequences such as overloading\nhealth care systems and overtreatment, with potential harms to healthy\nindividuals. The advent of machine-learning tools to assist diagnosis -- while\npromising rapid and more personalised patient management and screening -- might\ncontribute to this issue. The identification of overdiagnosis is usually post\nhoc and demonstrated after long periods (from years to decades) and costly\nrandomised control trials. In this paper, we present an innovative approach\nthat allows us to preemptively detect potential cases of overdiagnosis during\npredictive model development. This approach is based on the combination of\nlabels obtained from a prediction model and clustered medical trajectories,\nusing sepsis in adults as a test case. This is one of the first attempts to\nquantify machine-learning induced overdiagnosis and we believe will serves as a\nplatform for further development, leading to guidelines for safe deployment of\ncomputational diagnostic tools.",

Aside from greater\ngenerality, the advantage of our algorithms over alternatives is that they\nresolve some long-standing convergence difficulties of the ``natural\" policy\niteration algorithm, which have been known since the Pollatschek and Avi-Itzhak\nmethod [PoA69] for finite-state Markov games. Mathematically, this ``natural\"\nalgorithm is a form of Newton's method for solving Bellman's equation, but\nNewton's method, contrary to the case of single-player DP problems, is not\nglobally convergent in the case of a minimax problem, because the Bellman\noperator may have components that are neither convex nor concave. Our\nalgorithms address this difficulty by introducing alternating player choices,\nand by using a policy-dependent mapping with a uniform sup-norm contraction\nproperty, similar to earlier works by Bertsekas and Yu [BeY10], [BeY12],\n[YuB13]. Moreover, our algorithms allow a convergent and highly parallelizable\nimplementation, which is based on state space partitioning, and distributed\nasynchronous policy evaluation and policy improvement operations within each\nset of the partition.

    "abstract": "Location-based services (LBS) are increasingly used in recent years, and\nconsequently a large amount of location traces are accumulating in a data\ncenter. Although these traces can be provided to a data analyst for geo-data\nanalysis, the disclosure of location traces raises serious privacy concerns.\nFinding an appropriate anonymization method for location traces is also\nextremely challenging, especially for long traces. To address this issue, we\nhave designed and held a location trace anonymization contest that deals with a\nlong trace (400 events per user) and fine-grained locations (1024 regions). In\nour contest, each team anonymizes her original traces, and then the other teams\nperform privacy attacks against the anonymized traces (i.e., both defense and\nattack compete together) in a partial-knowledge attacker model where the\nadversary does not know the original traces. To realize such a contest, we\npropose a novel location synthesizer that has diversity in that synthetic\ntraces for each team are different from those for the other teams and utility\nin that synthetic traces preserve various statistical features of real traces.\nWe also show that re-identification alone is insufficient as a privacy risk,\nand that trace inference should be added as an additional risk. Specifically,\nwe show an example of anonymization that is perfectly secure against\nre-identification and is not secure against trace inference. Based on this, our\ncontest evaluates both the re-identification risk and trace inference risk, and\nanalyzes the relation between the two risks.

    "abstract": "Contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved great success in\nunsupervised visual representation learning by maximizing the similarity\nbetween two augmented views of the same image (positive pairs) and\nsimultaneously contrasting other different images (negative pairs). However,\nthis type of methods, such as SimCLR and MoCo, relies heavily on a large number\nof negative pairs and thus requires either large batches or memory banks. In\ncontrast, some recent non-contrastive SSL methods, such as BYOL and SimSiam,\nattempt to discard negative pairs by introducing asymmetry and show remarkable\nperformance. Unfortunately, to avoid collapsed solutions caused by not using\nnegative pairs, these methods require sophisticated asymmetry designs. In this\npaper, we argue that negative pairs are still necessary but one is sufficient,\ni.e., triplet is all you need. A simple triplet-based loss can achieve\nsurprisingly good performance without requiring large batches or asymmetry.\nMoreover, we observe that unsupervised visual representation learning can gain\nsignificantly from randomness. Based on this observation, we propose a simple\nplug-in RandOm MApping (ROMA) strategy by randomly mapping samples into other\nspaces and enforcing these randomly projected samples to satisfy the same\ncorrelation requirement.

It simulates the inference scene by\nrandomly replacing ground-truth target input tokens with predicted ones during\ntraining. Despite its success, its critical schedule strategies are merely\nbased on training steps, ignoring the real-time model competence, which limits\nits potential performance and convergence speed. To address this issue, we\npropose confidence-aware scheduled sampling. Specifically, we quantify\nreal-time model competence by the confidence of model predictions, based on\nwhich we design fine-grained schedule strategies. In this way, the model is\nexactly exposed to predicted tokens for high-confidence positions and still\nground-truth tokens for low-confidence positions. Moreover, we observe vanilla\nscheduled sampling suffers from degenerating into the original teacher forcing\nmode since most predicted tokens are the same as ground-truth tokens.\nTherefore, under the above confidence-aware strategy, we further expose more\nnoisy tokens (e.g., wordy and incorrect word order) instead of predicted ones\nfor high-confidence token positions.

This paper proposes a deep arbitrary polynomial chaos expansion\n(Deep aPCE) method to improve the balance between surrogate model accuracy and\ntraining data cost. On the one hand, the multilayer perceptron (MLP) model is\nused to solve the adaptive expansion coefficients of arbitrary polynomial chaos\nexpansion, which can improve the Deep aPCE model accuracy with lower expansion\norder.

Different from\nthese works, we propose a new dynamic modality-aware filter generation module\n(named MFGNet) to boost the message communication between visible and thermal\ndata by adaptively adjusting the convolutional kernels for various input images\nin practical tracking. Given the image pairs as input, we first encode their\nfeatures with the backbone network. Then, we concatenate these feature maps and\ngenerate dynamic modality-aware filters with two independent networks. The\nvisible and thermal filters will be used to conduct a dynamic convolutional\noperation on their corresponding input feature maps respectively. Inspired by\nresidual connection, both the generated visible and thermal feature maps will\nbe summarized with input feature maps. The augmented feature maps will be fed\ninto the RoI align module to generate instance-level features for subsequent\nclassification. To address issues caused by heavy occlusion, fast motion, and\nout-of-view, we propose to conduct a joint local and global search by\nexploiting a new direction-aware target-driven attention mechanism. The spatial\nand temporal recurrent neural network is used to capture the direction-aware\ncontext for accurate global attention prediction. Extensive experiments on\nthree large-scale RGB-T tracking benchmark datasets validated the effectiveness\nof our proposed algorithm.

    "title": "Impacts Towards a comprehensive assessment of the book impact by  integrating multiple evaluation sources",
    "abstract": "The surge in the number of books published makes the manual evaluation\nmethods difficult to efficiently evaluate books. The use of books' citations\nand alternative evaluation metrics can assist manual evaluation and reduce the\ncost of evaluation. However, most existing evaluation research was based on a\nsingle evaluation source with coarse-grained analysis, which may obtain\nincomprehensive or one-sided evaluation results of book impact. Meanwhile,\nrelying on a single resource for book assessment may lead to the risk that the\nevaluation results cannot be obtained due to the lack of the evaluation data,\nespecially for newly published books. Hence, this paper measured book impact\nbased on an evaluation system constructed by integrating multiple evaluation\nsources. Specifically, we conducted finer-grained mining on the multiple\nevaluation sources, including books' internal evaluation resources and external\nevaluation resources. Various technologies (e.g. topic extraction, sentiment\nanalysis, text classification) were used to extract corresponding evaluation\nmetrics from the internal and external evaluation resources. Then, Expert\nevaluation combined with analytic hierarchy process was used to integrate the\nevaluation metrics and construct a book impact evaluation system. Finally, the\nreliability of the evaluation system was verified by comparing with the results\nof expert evaluation, detailed and diversified evaluation results were then\nobtained. The experimental results reveal that differential evaluation\nresources can measure the books' impacts from different dimensions, and the\nintegration of multiple evaluation data can assess books more comprehensively.\nMeanwhile, the book impact evaluation system can provide personalized\nevaluation results according to the users' evaluation purposes. In addition,\nthe disciplinary differences should be considered for assessing books' impacts.",

    "abstract": "We investigate a new threat to neural sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models:\ntraining-time attacks that cause models to \"spin\" their output and support a\ncertain sentiment when the input contains adversary-chosen trigger words. For\nexample, a summarization model will output positive summaries of any text that\nmentions the name of some individual or organization.\nWe introduce the concept of a \"meta-backdoor\" to explain model-spinning\nattacks. These attacks produce models whose output is valid and preserves\ncontext, yet also satisfies a meta-task chosen by the adversary (e.g., positive\nsentiment). Previously studied backdoors in language models simply flip\nsentiment labels or replace words without regard to context. Their outputs are\nincorrect on inputs with the trigger. Meta-backdoors, on the other hand, are\nthe first class of backdoors that can be deployed against seq2seq models to (a)\nintroduce adversary-chosen spin into the output, while (b) maintaining standard\naccuracy metrics.\nTo demonstrate feasibility of model spinning, we develop a new backdooring\ntechnique. It stacks the adversarial meta-task (e.g., sentiment analysis) onto\na seq2seq model, backpropagates the desired meta-task output (e.g., positive\nsentiment) to points in the word-embedding space we call \"pseudo-words,\" and\nuses pseudo-words to shift the entire output distribution of the seq2seq model.\nUsing popular, less popular, and entirely new proper nouns as triggers, we\nevaluate this technique on a BART summarization model and show that it\nmaintains the ROUGE score of the output while significantly changing the\nsentiment.\nWe explain why model spinning can be a dangerous technique in AI-powered\ndisinformation and discuss how to mitigate these attacks.",

We aim to address several practical challenges,\nincluding limited storage and computation capacities of edge servers, delay of\nreconfiguring edge servers, and unknown future request arrival patterns. To\nthis end, we formulate the problem as an online optimization problem, in which\nthe objective function includes both the costs of forwarding requests,\nprocessing requests, and reconfiguring edge servers. By leveraging a natural\ntimescale separation between service routing and service caching, namely, the\nformer happens faster than the latter, we propose an online two-stage algorithm\nand its randomized variant.

    "abstract": "We develop a Random Forest model to estimate the species distribution of\nAsian elephants in India and study the inter and intra-annual spatiotemporal\nvariability of habitats suitable for them. Climatic, topographic variables and\nsatellite-derived Land Use/Land Cover (LULC), Net Primary Productivity (NPP),\nLeaf Area Index (LAI), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) are\nused as predictors, and the species sighting data of Asian elephants from\nGlobal Biodiversity Information Reserve is used to develop the Random Forest\nmodel. A careful hyper-parameter tuning and training-validation-testing cycle\nare completed to identify the significant predictors and develop a final model\nthat gives precision and recall of 0.78 and 0.77. The model is applied to\nestimate the spatial and temporal variability of suitable habitats. We observe\nthat seasonal reduction in the suitable habitat may explain the migration\npatterns of Asian elephants and the increasing human-elephant conflict.\nFurther, the total available suitable habitat area is observed to have reduced,\nwhich exacerbates the problem. This machine learning model is intended to serve\nas an input to the Agent-Based Model that we are building as part of our\nArtificial Intelligence-driven decision support tool to reduce human-wildlife\nconflict.",

It's developing very fast, but there is no processing\nmethod for the ReID task in multiple scenarios at this stage. However, this\ndose happen all the time in real life, such as the security scenarios. This\npaper explores a new scenario of Re-identification, which differs in\nperspective, background, and pose(walking or cycling).\nObviously, ordinary ReID processing methods cannot handle this scenario well.\nAs we all konw, the best way to deal with that it is to introduce image\ndatasets in this scanario, But this one is very expensive. To solve this\nproblem, this paper proposes a simple and effective way to generate images in\nsome new scenario, which is named Copy and Paste method based on Pose(CPP). The\nCPP is a method based on key point detection, using copy and paste, to\ncomposite a new semantic image dataset in two different semantic image\ndatasets. Such as, we can use pedestrians and bicycles to generate some images\nthat shows the same person rides on different bicycles. The CPP is suitable for\nReID tasks in new scenarios and it outperforms state-of-the-art on the original\ndatasets in original ReID tasks.

In this paper, we present ENCO, an efficient structure\nlearning method for directed, acyclic causal graphs leveraging observational\nand interventional data.

    "abstract": "In this work we show that high dimensional expansion implies locally testable\ncode. Specifically, we define a notion that we call\nhigh-dimensional-expanding-system (HDE-system). This is a set system defined by\nincidence relations with certain high dimensional expansion relations between\nits sets. We say that a linear code is modelled over HDE-system, if the\ncollection of linear constraints that the code satisfies could by described via\nthe HDE-system. We show that a code that can be modelled over HDE-system is\nlocally testable.\nThis implies that high dimensional expansion phenomenon solely implies local\ntestability of codes. Prior work had to rely to local notions of local\ntestability to get some global forms of testability (e.g. co-systolic expansion\nfrom local one, global agreement from local one), while our work infers global\ntestability directly from high dimensional expansion without relying on some\nlocal form of testability.\nThe local testability result that we obtain from HDE-systems is, in fact,\nstronger than standard one, and we term it amplified local testability.\nWe further show that most of the well studied locally testable codes as\nReed-Muller codes and more generally affine invariant codes with single-orbit\nproperty fall into our framework. Namely, it is possible to show that they are\nmodelled over an HDE-system, and hence the family of all p-ary affine invariant\ncodes is amplified locally testable. This yields the strongest known testing\nresults for affine invariant codes with single orbit, strengthening the work of\nKaufman and Sudan.",

    "abstract": "Zero-resource named entity recognition (NER) severely suffers from data\nscarcity in a specific domain or language. Most studies on zero-resource NER\ntransfer knowledge from various data by fine-tuning on different auxiliary\ntasks. However, how to properly select training data and fine-tuning tasks is\nstill an open problem. In this paper, we tackle the problem by transferring\nknowledge from three aspects, i.e., domain, language and task, and\nstrengthening connections among them. Specifically, we propose four practical\nguidelines to guide knowledge transfer and task fine-tuning. Based on these\nguidelines, we design a target-oriented fine-tuning (TOF) framework to exploit\nvarious data from three aspects in a unified training manner. Experimental\nresults on six benchmarks show that our method yields consistent improvements\nover baselines in both cross-domain and cross-lingual scenarios. Particularly,\nwe achieve new state-of-the-art performance on five benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Deep convolutional networks have become the mainstream in computer vision\napplications. Although CNNs have been successful in many computer vision tasks,\nit is not free from drawbacks. The performance of CNN is dramatically degraded\nby geometric transformation, such as large rotations. In this paper, we propose\na novel CNN architecture that can improve the robustness against geometric\ntransformations without modifying the existing backbones of their CNNs. The key\nis to enclose the existing backbone with a geometric transformation (and the\ncorresponding reverse transformation) and a feature map ensemble. The proposed\nmethod can inherit the strengths of existing CNNs that have been presented so\nfar. Furthermore, the proposed method can be employed in combination with\nstate-of-the-art data augmentation algorithms to improve their performance. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method using standard datasets\nsuch as CIFAR, CUB-200, and Mnist-rot-12k.",

    "title": "CGuard: Efficient Spatial Safety for C",
    "abstract": "Spatial safety violations are the root cause of many security attacks and\nunexpected behavior of applications. Existing techniques to enforce spatial\nsafety work broadly at either object or pointer granularity. Object-based\napproaches tend to incur high CPU overheads, whereas pointer-based approaches\nincur both high CPU and memory overheads. SGXBounds, an object-based approach,\nis so far the most efficient technique that provides complete out-of-bounds\nprotection for objects. However, a major drawback of this approach is that it\nrestricts the application address space to 4GB.\nIn this paper, we present CGuard, a tool that provides object-bounds\nprotection for C applications with comparable overheads to SGXBounds without\nrestricting the application address space. CGuard stores the bounds information\njust before the base address of an object and encodes the relative offset of\nthe base address in the spare bits of the virtual address available in x86_64\narchitecture. For an object that can't fit in the spare bits, CGuard uses a\ncustom memory layout that enables it to find the base address of the object in\njust one memory access. Our study revealed spatial safety violations in the gcc\nand x264 benchmarks from the SPEC CPU2017 benchmark suite and the string_match\nbenchmark from the Phoenix benchmark suite. The execution time overheads for\nthe SPEC CPU2017 and Phoenix benchmark suites were 44% and 25% respectively,\nwhereas the reduction in the throughput for the Apache webserver when the CPUs\nwere fully saturated was 30%. These results indicate that CGuard can be highly\neffective while maintaining a reasonable degree of efficiency.",

    "title": "Improving the Authentication with Built-in Camera ProtocolUsing Built-in  Motion Sensors: A Deep Learning Solution",
    "abstract": "We propose an enhanced version of the Authentication with Built-in Camera\n(ABC) protocol by employing a deep learning solution based on built-in motion\nsensors. The standard ABC protocol identifies mobile devices based on the\nphoto-response non-uniformity (PRNU) of the camera sensor, while also\nconsidering QR-code-based meta-information. During authentication, the user is\nrequired to take two photos that contain two QR codes presented on a screen.\nThe presented QR code images also contain a unique probe signal, similar to a\ncamera fingerprint, generated by the protocol. During verification, the server\ncomputes the fingerprint of the received photos and authenticates the user if\n(i) the probe signal is present, (ii) the metadata embedded in the QR codes is\ncorrect and (iii) the camera fingerprint is identified correctly. However, the\nprotocol is vulnerable to forgery attacks when the attacker can compute the\ncamera fingerprint from external photos, as shown in our preliminary work. In\nthis context, we propose an enhancement for the ABC protocol based on motion\nsensor data, as an additional and passive authentication layer. Smartphones can\nbe identified through their motion sensor data, which, unlike photos, is never\nposted by users on social media platforms, thus being more secure than using\nphotographs alone. To this end, we transform motion signals into embedding\nvectors produced by deep neural networks, applying Support Vector Machines for\nthe smartphone identification task. Our change to the ABC protocol results in a\nmulti-modal protocol that lowers the false acceptance rate for the attack\nproposed in our previous work to a percentage as low as 0.07%.",

    "abstract": "With the ever-increasing popularity of Service-oriented Architecture (SoA)\nand Internet of Things (IoT), a considerable number of enterprises or\norganizations are attempting to encapsulate their provided complex business\nservices into various lightweight and accessible web APIs (application\nprogramming interfaces) with diverse functions. In this situation, a software\ndeveloper can select a group of preferred web APIs from a massive number of\ncandidates to create a complex mashup economically and quickly based on the\nkeywords typed by the developer. However, traditional keyword-based web API\nsearch approaches often suffer from the following difficulties and challenges.\nFirst, they often focus more on the functional matching between the candidate\nweb APIs and the mashup to be developed while neglecting the compatibility\namong different APIs, which probably returns a group of incompatible web APIs\nand further leads to a mashup development failure. Second, existing approaches\noften return a web API composition solution to the mashup developer for\nreference, which narrows the developer's API selection scope considerably and\nmay reduce developer satisfaction heavily. In view of the above challenges and\nsuccessful application of game theory in the IoT, based on the idea of game\ntheory, we propose a compatible and diverse web APIs recommendation approach\nfor mashup creations, named MCCOMP+DIV, to return multiple sets of diverse and\ncompatible web APIs with higher success rate. Finally, we validate the\neffectiveness and efficiency of MCCOMP+DIV through a set of experiments based\non a real-world web API dataset, i.e., the PW dataset crawled from\nProgrammableWeb.com.",

    "abstract": "A key challenge of affective computing research is discovering ways to\nreliably transfer affect models that are built in the laboratory to real world\nsettings, namely in the wild. The existing gap between in vitro and in vivo\naffect applications is mainly caused by limitations related to affect sensing\nincluding intrusiveness, hardware malfunctions, availability of sensors, but\nalso privacy and security. As a response to these limitations in this paper we\nare inspired by recent advances in machine learning and introduce the concept\nof privileged information for operating affect models in the wild. The presence\nof privileged information enables affect models to be trained across multiple\nmodalities available in a lab setting and ignore modalities that are not\navailable in the wild with no significant drop in their modeling performance.\nThe proposed privileged information framework is tested in a game arousal\ncorpus that contains physiological signals in the form of heart rate and\nelectrodermal activity, game telemetry, and pixels of footage from two\ndissimilar games that are annotated with arousal traces. By training our\narousal models using all modalities (in vitro) and using solely pixels for\ntesting the models (in vivo), we reach levels of accuracy obtained from models\nthat fuse all modalities both for training and testing. The findings of this\npaper make a decisive step towards realizing affect interaction in the wild.",

To examine this apparent resurgence,\nwe conduct a large-scale study of Anonymous affiliates on Twitter. To this end,\nwe first use machine learning to identify a significant network of more than\n33,000 Anonymous accounts. Through topic modelling of tweets collected from\nthese accounts, we find evidence of sustained interest in topics related to\nBLM. We then use sentiment analysis on tweets focused on these topics, finding\nevidence of a united approach amongst the group, with positive tweets typically\nbeing used to express support towards BLM, and negative tweets typically being\nused to criticize police actions. Finally, we examine the presence of\nautomation in the network, identifying indications of bot-like behavior across\nthe majority of Anonymous accounts.

Such\napplications can be provided upon humongous volumes of data collected by IoT\ndevices being transferred to the edge nodes through the network. Various\nprocessing activities can be performed on the discussed data and multiple\ncollaborative opportunities between EC nodes can facilitate the execution of\nthe desired tasks. In order to support an effective interaction between edge\nnodes, the knowledge about the geographically distributed data should be\nshared. Obviously, the migration of large amounts of data will harm the\nstability of the network stability and its performance. In this paper, we\nrecommend the exchange of data synopses than real data between EC nodes to\nprovide them with the necessary knowledge about peer nodes owning similar data.\nThis knowledge can be valuable when considering decisions such as data/service\nmigration and tasks offloading. We describe an continuous reasoning model that\nbuilds a temporal similarity map of the available datasets to get nodes\nunderstanding the evolution of data in their peers. We support the proposed\ndecision making mechanism through an intelligent similarity extraction scheme\nbased on an unsupervised machine learning model, and, at the same time, combine\nit with a statistical measure that represents the trend of the so-called\ndiscrepancy quantum. Our model can reveal the differences in the exchanged\nsynopses and provide a datasets similarity map which becomes the appropriate\nknowledge base to support the desired processing activities.

    "abstract": "Over the past two decades, C++ has been adopted as a major HPC language\n(displacing C to a large extent, andFortran to some degree as well).

Demand is demonstrably\nstrong for this second attempt at language support for C++ in MPI after the\noriginal interface, which was added in MPI-2, then was found to lack specific\nbenefits over theC binding, and so was subsequently removed in MPI-3. Since C++\nand its idiomatic usage have evolved since the original C++ language binding\nwas removed from the standard, this new effort is both timely and important for\nMPI applications.

    "abstract": "\"Bad\" data has a direct impact on 88% of companies, with the average company\nlosing 12% of its revenue due to it. Duplicates - multiple but different\nrepresentations of the same real-world entities - are among the main reasons\nfor poor data quality. Therefore, finding and configuring the right\ndeduplication solution is essential. Various data matching benchmarks exist\nwhich address this issue. However, many of them focus on the quality of\nmatching results and neglect other important factors, such as business\nrequirements. Additionally, they often do not specify how to explore benchmark\nresults, which helps understand matching solution behavior. To address this gap\nbetween the mere counting of record pairs vs. a comprehensive means to evaluate\ndata matching approaches, we present the benchmark platform Frost. Frost\ncombines existing benchmarks, established quality metrics, a benchmark\ndimension for soft KPIs, and techniques to systematically explore and\nunderstand matching results. Thus, it can be used to compare multiple matching\nsolutions regarding quality, usability, and economic aspects, but also to\ncompare multiple runs of the same matching solution for understanding its\nbehavior. Frost is implemented and published in the open-source application\nSnowman, which includes the visual exploration of matching results.",

    "abstract": "Despite their potential of increasing operational efficiency, transparency,\nand safety, the use of Localization and Tracking Systems (LTSs) in warehouse\nenvironments remains seldom. One reason is the lack of market transparency and\nstakeholder's trust in the systems' performance as a consequence of poor use of\nTest and Evaluation (T&E) methods and transferability of the obtained T&E\nresults. The T&E 4Log (Test and Evaluation for Logistics) Framework was\ndeveloped to examine how the transferability of T&E results to practical\nscenarios in warehouse environments can be increased. Conventional T&E\napproaches are integrated and extended under consideration of the warehouse\nenvironment, logistics applications, and domain-specific requirements, into an\napplication-driven T&E framework. The application of the proposed framework in\nstandard and application-dependent test cases leads to a set of performance\ncriteria and corresponding application-specific requirements. This enables a\nwell-founded identification of suitable LTSs for given warehouse applications.\nThe T&E 4Log Framework was implemented at the Institute for Technical Logistics\n(ITL) and validated by T&E of a reflector-based Light Detection and Ranging\n(LiDAR) LTS, a contour-based LiDAR LTS, and an Ultra-Wideband (UWB) LTS for the\nexemplary applications Automated Pallet Booking, Goods Tracking, and Autonomous\nForklift Navigation.",

To remedy these\nissues, we propose to train the GAN on grids (i.e. each cell covers a part of a\nshape). In this representation each cell is equipped with a latent vector\nprovided by an AE. This localized representation enables more expressiveness\n(since the cell-based latent vectors can be combined in novel ways) as well as\nspatial control of the generation process (e.g. via bounding boxes).

The commonly used hardware-aware network\ncompression techniques address this question with pruning, kernel fusion,\nquantization and lowering precision. However, these approaches do not change\nthe underlying network operations. In this paper, we propose hardware-aware\nnetwork transformation (HANT), which accelerates a network by replacing\ninefficient operations with more efficient alternatives using a neural\narchitecture search like approach. HANT tackles the problem in two phase: In\nthe first phase, a large number of alternative operations per every layer of\nthe teacher model is trained using layer-wise feature map distillation. In the\nsecond phase, the combinatorial selection of efficient operations is relaxed to\nan integer optimization problem that can be solved in a few seconds. We extend\nHANT with kernel fusion and quantization to improve throughput even further.\nOur experimental results on accelerating the EfficientNet family show that HANT\ncan accelerate them by up to 3.6x with <0.4% drop in the top-1 accuracy on the\nImageNet dataset. When comparing the same latency level, HANT can accelerate\nEfficientNet-B4 to the same latency as EfficientNet-B1 while having 3% higher\naccuracy.

    "abstract": "Background: During the last years, there has been a lot of discussion and\nestimations on the energy consumption of Bitcoin miners. However, most of the\nstudies are focused on estimating energy consumption, not in exploring the\nfactors that determine it.\nGoal: To explore the factors that determine maximum energy consumption of\nBitcoin miners. In particular, analyze the limits of energy consumption, and to\nwhich extent variations of the factors could produce its reduction.\nMethod: Estimate the overall profit of all Bitcoin miners during a certain\nperiod of time, and the costs (including energy) that they face during that\ntime, because of the mining activity. The underlying assumptions is that miners\nwill only consume energy to mine Bitcoin if they have the expectation of\nprofit, and at the same time they are competitive with respect of each other.\nTherefore, they will operate as a group in the point where profits balance\nexpenditures.\nResults: We show a basic equation that determines energy consumption based on\nsome specific factors: minting, transaction fees, exchange rate, energy price,\nand amortization cost. We also define the Amortization Factor, which can be\ncomputed for mining devices based on their cost and energy consumption, helps\nto understand how the cost of equipment influences total energy consumption.\nConclusions: The factors driving energy consumption are identified, and from\nthem, some ways in which Bitcoin energy consumption could be reduced are\ndiscussed. Some of these ways do not reduce the most important properties of\nBitcoin, such as the chances of control of the aggregated hashpower, or the\nfundamentals of the proof of work mechanism. In general, the methods presented\ncan help to predict energy consumption in different scenarios, based on factors\nthat can be calculated from available data, or assumed in scenarios.",

Automatically tagging\nnew questions with existing taxonomy will help organize these questions into\ndifferent classes of hierarchical taxonomy so that they can be searched based\non the facets like chapter. This task can be formulated as a flat multi-class\nclassification problem. Usually, flat classification based methods ignore the\nsemantic relatedness between the terms in the hierarchical taxonomy and the\nquestions. Some traditional methods also suffer from the class imbalance issues\nas they consider only the leaf nodes ignoring the hierarchy. Hence, we\nformulate the problem as a similarity-based retrieval task where we optimize\nthe semantic relatedness between the taxonomy and the questions. We demonstrate\nthat our method helps to handle the unseen labels and hence can be used for\ntaxonomy tagging in the wild. In this method, we augment the question with its\ncorresponding answer to capture more semantic information and then align the\nquestion-answer pair's contextualized embedding with the corresponding label\n(taxonomy) vector representations. The representations are aligned by\nfine-tuning a transformer based model with a loss function that is a\ncombination of the cosine similarity and hinge rank loss. The loss function\nmaximizes the similarity between the question-answer pair and the correct label\nrepresentations and minimizes the similarity to unrelated labels. Finally, we\nperform experiments on two real-world datasets. We show that the proposed\nlearning method outperforms representations learned using the multi-class\nclassification method and other state of the art methods by 6% as measured by\nRecall@k.

    "abstract": "Codification of free-text clinical narratives have long been recognised to be\nbeneficial for secondary uses such as funding, insurance claim processing and\nresearch. The current scenario of assigning codes is a manual process which is\nvery expensive, time-consuming and error prone. In recent years, many\nresearchers have studied the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP), related\nMachine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methods and techniques to resolve\nthe problem of manual coding of clinical narratives and to assist human coders\nto assign clinical codes more accurately and efficiently. This systematic\nliterature review provides a comprehensive overview of automated clinical\ncoding systems that utilises appropriate NLP, ML and DL methods and techniques\nto assign ICD codes to discharge summaries. We have followed the Preferred\nReporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses(PRISMA) guidelines and\nconducted a comprehensive search of publications from January, 2010 to December\n2020 in four academic databases- PubMed, ScienceDirect, Association for\nComputing Machinery(ACM) Digital Library, and the Association for Computational\nLinguistics(ACL) Anthology. We reviewed 7,556 publications; 38 met the\ninclusion criteria. This review identified: datasets having discharge\nsummaries; NLP techniques along with some other data extraction processes,\ndifferent feature extraction and embedding techniques. To measure the\nperformance of classification methods, different evaluation metrics are used.\nLastly, future research directions are provided to scholars who are interested\nin automated ICD code assignment. Efforts are still required to improve ICD\ncode prediction accuracy, availability of large-scale de-identified clinical\ncorpora with the latest version of the classification system. This can be a\nplatform to guide and share knowledge with the less experienced coders and\nresearchers.",

    "abstract": "We envision robots that can collaborate and communicate seamlessly with\nhumans. It is necessary for such robots to decide both what to say and how to\nact, while interacting with humans. To this end, we introduce a new task,\ndialogue object search: A robot is tasked to search for a target object (e.g.\nfork) in a human environment (e.g., kitchen), while engaging in a \"video call\"\nwith a remote human who has additional but inexact knowledge about the target's\nlocation. That is, the robot conducts speech-based dialogue with the human,\nwhile sharing the image from its mounted camera. This task is challenging at\nmultiple levels, from data collection, algorithm and system development,to\nevaluation. Despite these challenges, we believe such a task blocks the path\ntowards more intelligent and collaborative robots. In this extended abstract,\nwe motivate and introduce the dialogue object search task and analyze examples\ncollected from a pilot study. We then discuss our next steps and conclude with\nseveral challenges on which we hope to receive feedback.",

Once\ntrained, the forward pass of a DNN is often much faster than traditional,\noptimization-based methods used to solve inverse problems. This is however done\nat the cost of lower interpretability, a fundamental limitation in most medical\napplications. We propose an approach for solving general inverse problems which\ncombines the efficiency of DNN and the interpretability of traditional\nanalytical methods.

Our method can handle generative forward models that are\ncostly to evaluate and exhibits similar performance in accuracy and computation\ntime as a fully-learned DNN, while maintaining high interpretability and being\neasier to train.

    "abstract": "Topology Optimization is the process of finding the optimal arrangement of\nmaterials within a design domain by minimizing a cost function, subject to some\nperformance constraints. Robust topology optimization (RTO) also incorporates\nthe effect of input uncertainties and produces a design with the best average\nperformance of the structure while reducing the response sensitivity to input\nuncertainties. It is computationally expensive to carry out RTO using finite\nelement and Monte Carlo sampling. In this work, we use neural network\nsurrogates to enable a faster solution approach via surrogate-based\noptimization and build a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to transform the the\nhigh dimensional design space into a low dimensional one. Furthermore, finite\nelement solvers will be replaced by a neural network surrogate. Also, to\nfurther facilitate the design exploration, we limit our search to a subspace,\nwhich consists of designs that are solutions to deterministic topology\noptimization problems under different realizations of input uncertainties. With\nthese neural network approximations, a gradient-based optimization approach is\nformed to minimize the predicted objective function over the low dimensional\ndesign subspace. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on\ntwo compliance minimization problems and show that VAE performs well on\nlearning the features of the design from minimal training data, and that\nconverting the design space into a low dimensional latent space makes the\nproblem computationally efficient.

    "abstract": "In this work, we establish a convenient similarity between an adaptive\nbackstepping control law and a standard proportional-integral-derivative (PID)\ncontroller for a class of second-order systems. The extracted similarity\nprovides a deeper understanding of the adaptive backstepping design from a\nperformance perspective via an intuitive method to select its otherwise\nabstract controller gains, on top of its traditional stability perspective.\nSuch a similarity analysis opens the door for researchers to use\nwell-established PID tuning methods to predict the performance of Lyapunov\nstability-based controllers. At the same time, the obtained formulation reveals\nhow the corresponding PID control law can be linked to Lyapunov stability\ntheory.",

    "abstract": "Causal discovery from observational data is a challenging task to which an\nexact solution cannot always be identified. Under assumptions about the\ndata-generative process, the causal graph can often be identified up to an\nequivalence class. Proposing new realistic assumptions to circumscribe such\nequivalence classes is an active field of research. In this work, we propose a\nnew set of assumptions that constrain possible causal relationships based on\nthe nature of the variables. We thus introduce typed directed acyclic graphs,\nin which variable types are used to determine the validity of causal\nrelationships. We demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, that the\nproposed assumptions can result in significant gains in the identification of\nthe causal graph.",

    "abstract": "In order to construct an ethical artificial intelligence (AI) two complex\nproblems must be overcome. Firstly, humans do not consistently agree on what is\nor is not ethical. Second, contemporary AI and machine learning methods tend to\nbe blunt instruments which either search for solutions within the bounds of\npredefined rules, or mimic behaviour. An ethical AI must be capable of\ninferring unspoken rules, interpreting nuance and context, possess and be able\nto infer intent, and explain not just its actions but its intent. Using\nenactivism, semiotics, perceptual symbol systems and symbol emergence, we\nspecify an agent that learns not just arbitrary relations between signs but\ntheir meaning in terms of the perceptual states of its sensorimotor system.\nSubsequently it can learn what is meant by a sentence and infer the intent of\nothers in terms of its own experiences. It has malleable intent because the\nmeaning of symbols changes as it learns, and its intent is represented\nsymbolically as a goal. As such it may learn a concept of what is most likely\nto be considered ethical by the majority within a population of humans, which\nmay then be used as a goal. The meaning of abstract symbols is expressed using\nperceptual symbols of raw sensorimotor stimuli as the weakest (consistent with\nOckham's Razor) necessary and sufficient concept, an intensional definition\nlearned from an ostensive definition, from which the extensional definition or\ncategory of all ethical decisions may be obtained. Because these abstract\nsymbols are the same for both situation and response, the same symbol is used\nwhen either performing or observing an action. This is akin to mirror neurons\nin the human brain. Mirror symbols may allow the agent to empathise, because\nits own experiences are associated with the symbol, which is also associated\nwith the observation of another agent experiencing something that symbol\nrepresents.",

These faces, also known as \"Deep Fakes\", appear as\nrealistic photographs with very little pixel-level distortions. While some work\nhas enabled the training of models that lead to the generation of specific\nproperties of the subject, generating a facial image based on a natural\nlanguage description has not been fully explored. For security and criminal\nidentification, the ability to provide a GAN-based system that works like a\nsketch artist would be incredibly useful. In this paper, we present a novel\napproach to generate facial images from semantic text descriptions. The learned\nmodel is provided with a text description and an outline of the type of face,\nwhich the model uses to sketch the features. Our models are trained using an\nAffine Combination Module (ACM) mechanism to combine the text embedding from\nBERT and the GAN latent space using a self-attention matrix. This avoids the\nloss of features due to inadequate \"attention\", which may happen if text\nembedding and latent vector are simply concatenated. Our approach is capable of\ngenerating images that are very accurately aligned to the exhaustive textual\ndescriptions of faces with many fine detail features of the face and helps in\ngenerating better images. The proposed method is also capable of making\nincremental changes to a previously generated image if it is provided with\nadditional textual descriptions or sentences.",

    "abstract": "Efficiently modeling spatial-temporal information in videos is crucial for\naction recognition. To achieve this goal, state-of-the-art methods typically\nemploy the convolution operator and the dense interaction modules such as\nnon-local blocks. However, these methods cannot accurately fit the diverse\nevents in videos. On the one hand, the adopted convolutions are with fixed\nscales, thus struggling with events of various scales. On the other hand, the\ndense interaction modeling paradigm only achieves sub-optimal performance as\naction-irrelevant parts bring additional noises for the final prediction. In\nthis paper, we propose a unified action recognition framework to investigate\nthe dynamic nature of video content by introducing the following designs.\nFirst, when extracting local cues, we generate the spatial-temporal kernels of\ndynamic-scale to adaptively fit the diverse events. Second, to accurately\naggregate these cues into a global video representation, we propose to mine the\ninteractions only among a few selected foreground objects by a Transformer,\nwhich yields a sparse paradigm. We call the proposed framework as Event\nAdaptive Network (EAN) because both key designs are adaptive to the input video\ncontent. To exploit the short-term motions within local segments, we propose a\nnovel and efficient Latent Motion Code (LMC) module, further improving the\nperformance of the framework.

    "abstract": "Human-in-the-loop telerobotic systems (HiLTS) are robotic tools designed to\nextend and in some circumstances improve the dexterous capabilities of the\nhuman operator in virtual and remote environments. Dexterous manipulation,\nhowever, depends on how well the telerobot is incorporated into the operator's\nsensorimotor control scheme. Empirical evidence suggests that haptic feedback\ncan lead to improved dexterity. Unfortunately, haptic feedback can also\nintroduce dynamics between the leader and follower of the telerobot that affect\nboth stability and device performance. While concerted research effort has\nfocused on masking these device dynamics or bypassing them altogether, it is\nnot well understood how human operators incorporate these dynamics into their\ncontrol scheme. We believe that to advance dexterous telerobotic manipulation,\nit is crucial to understand the process by which humans operators incorporate\nteleoperator dynamics and distinguish them from the dynamics of the\nenvironment. Key to this knowledge is an understanding of how advanced\ntelerobotic architectures compare to the gold standard, the rigid mechanical\nteleoperators first introduced in the 1950's. In this manuscript, we present a\nteleoperator testbed that has reconfigurable transmissions between the leader\nand follower to change its dynamic behavior. The intent of this testbed is to\ninvestigate the effect of the teleoperator's dynamics on perception of and task\nperformance in the remote/virtual environment. We describe the hardware and\nsoftware components of the testbed and then demonstrate how the different\nteleoperator transmissions can lead to differences, sometimes significant, in\nthe dynamics that would be felt by the operator when exploring the same\nenvironment.",

    "abstract": "The polymorphic RPC calculus allows programmers to write succinct multitier\nprograms using polymorphic location constructs. However, until now it lacked an\nimplementation. We develop an experimental programming language based on the\npolymorphic RPC calculus. We introduce a polymorphic Client-Server (CS)\ncalculus with the client and server parts separated. In contrast to existing\nuntyped CS calculi, our calculus is not only able to resolve polymorphic\nlocations statically, but it is also able to do so dynamically. We design a\ntype-based slicing compilation of the polymorphic RPC calculus into this CS\ncalculus, proving type and semantic correctness. We propose a method to erase\ntypes unnecessary for execution but retaining locations at runtime by\ntranslating the polymorphic CS calculus into an untyped CS calculus, proving\nsemantic correctness.",

    "abstract": "The micro-macro (mM) decomposition approach is considered for the numerical\nsolution of the Vlasov--Poisson--Lenard--Bernstein (VPLB) system, which is\nrelevant for plasma physics applications. In the mM approach, the kinetic\ndistribution function is decomposed as\n$f=\\mathcal{E}[\\boldsymbol{\\rho}_{f}]+g$, where $\\mathcal{E}$ is a local\nequilibrium distribution, depending on the macroscopic moments\n$\\boldsymbol{\\rho}_{f}=\\int_{\\mathbb{R}}\\boldsymbol{e}\nfdv=\\langle\\boldsymbol{e} f\\rangle_{\\mathbb{R}}$, where\n$\\boldsymbol{e}=(1,v,\\frac{1}{2}v^{2})^{\\rm{T}}$, and $g$, the microscopic\ndistribution, is defined such that $\\langle\\boldsymbol{e}\ng\\rangle_{\\mathbb{R}}=0$. We aim to design numerical methods for the mM\ndecomposition of the VPLB system, which consists of coupled equations for\n$\\boldsymbol{\\rho}_{f}$ and $g$. To this end, we use the discontinuous Galerkin\n(DG) method for phase-space discretization, and implicit-explicit (IMEX) time\nintegration, where the phase-space advection terms are integrated explicitly\nand the collision operator is integrated implicitly. We give special\nconsideration to ensure that the resulting mM method maintains the\n$\\langle\\boldsymbol{e} g\\rangle_{\\mathbb{R}}=0$ constraint, which may be\nnecessary for obtaining (i) satisfactory results in the collision dominated\nregime with coarse velocity resolution, and (ii) unambiguous conservation\nproperties. The constraint-preserving property is achieved through a consistent\ndiscretization of the equations governing the micro and macro components.

    "title": "Active Learning in Incomplete Label Multiple Instance Multiple Label  Learning",
    "abstract": "In multiple instance multiple label learning, each sample, a bag, consists of\nmultiple instances. To alleviate labeling complexity, each sample is associated\nwith a set of bag-level labels leaving instances within the bag unlabeled. This\nsetting is more convenient and natural for representing complicated objects,\nwhich have multiple semantic meanings. Compared to single instance labeling,\nthis approach allows for labeling larger datasets at an equivalent labeling\ncost. However, for sufficiently large datasets, labeling all bags may become\nprohibitively costly. Active learning uses an iterative labeling and retraining\napproach aiming to provide reasonable classification performance using a small\nnumber of labeled samples. To our knowledge, only a few works in the area of\nactive learning in the MIML setting are available. These approaches can provide\npractical solutions to reduce labeling cost but their efficacy remains unclear.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel bag-class pair based approach for active\nlearning in the MIML setting. Due to the partial availability of bag-level\nlabels, we focus on the incomplete-label MIML setting for the proposed active\nlearning approach. Our approach is based on a discriminative graphical model\nwith efficient and exact inference. For the query process, we adapt active\nlearning criteria to the novel bag-class pair selection strategy. Additionally,\nwe introduce an online stochastic gradient descent algorithm to provide an\nefficient model update after each query. Numerical experiments on benchmark\ndatasets illustrate the robustness of the proposed approach.",

In the past few years,\nmany such private constellations have been launched or are in planning, e.g.\nSpaceX and OneWeb to name a few. In this article we take a closer look at the\nprivate constellations and give a comprehensive overview of their features. We\nthen discuss major technical challenges resulting from their design and briefly\nreview the recent literature addressing these challenges. Studying the emerging\nprivate constellations gives us useful insights for engineering the future\nSTNs. To this end, we study the satellite mobility and evaluate the impact of\ntwo handover strategies on the space-to-ground link performance of four real\nprivate NGSO constellations. We show that the link capacity, delay, and\nhandover rate vary across the constellations, so the optimal handover strategy\ndepends on the constellation design. Consequently, the communications solutions\nof future STNs should be compliant with the constellation specifics, and the\nSTN standards need to be flexible enough to support satellite operation with\nthe large parameter space observed in the emerging private constellations.",

The Grassmannian $\\mathbb{G}_q(n,k)$ is the collection of all\nsubspaces of dimension $k$ in $\\mathbb{P}_q(n)$. We study equidistant linear\ncodes in $\\mathbb{P}_q(n)$ in this paper and establish that the normalized\nminimum distance of a linear code is maximum if and only if it is equidistant.\nWe prove that the upper bound on the size of such class of linear codes is\n$2^n$ when $q=2$ as conjectured by Braun et al. Moreover, the codes attaining\nthis bound are shown to have structures akin to combinatorial objects, viz.\n\\emph{Fano plane} and \\emph{sunflower}. We also prove the existence of\nequidistant linear codes in $\\mathbb{P}_q(n)$ for any prime power $q$ using\n\\emph{Steiner triple system}.

    "abstract": "An $(m,n,a,b)$-tensor code consists of $m\\times n$ matrices whose columns\nsatisfy `$a$' parity checks and rows satisfy `$b$' parity checks (i.e., a\ntensor code is the tensor product of a column code and row code). Tensor codes\nare useful in distributed storage because a single erasure can be corrected\nquickly either by reading its row or column. Maximally Recoverable (MR) Tensor\nCodes, introduced by Gopalan et al., are tensor codes which can correct every\nerasure pattern that is information theoretically possible to correct. The main\nquestions about MR Tensor Codes are characterizing which erasure patterns are\ncorrectable and obtaining explicit constructions over small fields.\nIn this paper, we study the important special case when $a=1$, i.e., the\ncolumns satisfy a single parity check equation. We introduce the notion of\nhigher order MDS codes (MDS$(\\ell)$ codes) which is an interesting\ngeneralization of the well-known MDS codes, where $\\ell$ captures the order of\ngenericity of points in a low-dimensional space. We then prove that a tensor\ncode with $a=1$ is MR iff the row code is an MDS$(m)$ code. We then show that\nMDS$(m)$ codes satisfy some weak duality. Using this characterization and\nduality, we prove that $(m,n,a=1,b)$-MR tensor codes require fields of size\n$q=\\Omega_{m,b}(n^{\\min\\{b,m\\}-1})$. Our lower bound also extends to the\nsetting of $a>1$. We also give a deterministic polynomial time algorithm to\ncheck if a given erasure pattern is correctable by the MR tensor code (when\n$a=1$).",

Many current micro-assembly methods\nare serial in nature, resulting in unfeasibly low throughput.

Specifically, we devise two passive inference techniques\nto demonstrate how a passive eavesdropper, located outside the smart home, can\nreliably identify in-home devices or events from the encrypted wireless Zigbee\ntraffic by 1) inferring a single application layer (APL) command in the event's\ntraffic burst, and 2) exploiting the device's periodic reporting pattern and\ninterval.

The use of Transformer is\nrooted in the need of extracting local discriminative features adaptively for\ndifferent labels, which is a strongly desired property due to the existence of\nmultiple objects in one image. The built-in cross-attention module in the\nTransformer decoder offers an effective way to use label embeddings as queries\nto probe and pool class-related features from a feature map computed by a\nvision backbone for subsequent binary classifications.

    "abstract": "The full range of activity in a temporal network is captured in its edge\nactivity data -- time series encoding the tie strengths or on-off dynamics of\neach edge in the network. However, in many practical applications, edge-level\ndata are unavailable, and the network analyses must rely instead on node\nactivity data which aggregates the edge-activity data and thus is less\ninformative. This raises the question: Is it possible to use the static network\nto recover the richer edge activities from the node activities? Here we show\nthat recovery is possible, often with a surprising degree of accuracy given how\nmuch information is lost, and that the recovered data are useful for subsequent\nnetwork analysis tasks. Recovery is more difficult when network density\nincreases, either topologically or dynamically, but exploiting dynamical and\ntopological sparsity enables effective solutions to the recovery problem. We\nformally characterize the difficulty of the recovery problem both theoretically\nand empirically, proving the conditions under which recovery errors can be\nbounded and showing that, even when these conditions are not met, good quality\nsolutions can still be derived. Effective recovery carries both promise and\nperil, as it enables deeper scientific study of complex systems but in the\ncontext of social systems also raises privacy concerns when social information\ncan be aggregated across multiple data sources.",

Existing methods rely on explicit supervision to establish multi-view\ncorrespondences, such as template shape models and keypoint annotations, which\nrestricts their applicability on objects \"in the wild\". In this paper, we\npropose to use monocular videos, which naturally provide correspondences across\ntime, allowing us to learn 3D shapes of deformable object categories without\nexplicit keypoints or template shapes. Specifically, we present DOVE, which\nlearns to predict 3D canonical shape, deformation, viewpoint and texture from a\nsingle 2D image of a bird, given a bird video collection as well as\nautomatically obtained silhouettes and optical flows as training data. Our\nmethod reconstructs temporally consistent 3D shape and deformation, which\nallows us to animate and re-render the bird from arbitrary viewpoints from a\nsingle image.",

These methods face two persistent\nchallenges: manual hyperparameter tuning and convergence time to high-accuracy\nsolutions. To address these, we explore how Reinforcement Learning (RL) can\nlearn a policy to tune parameters to accelerate convergence. In experiments\nwith well-known QP benchmarks we find that our RL policy, RLQP, significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art QP solvers by up to 3x. RLQP generalizes\nsurprisingly well to previously unseen problems with varying dimension and\nstructure from different applications, including the QPLIB, Netlib LP and\nMaros-Meszaros problems.

Ternary braiding gates acting on three qubit states\nare studied in detail. We also consider exotic non-invertible gates which can\nbe related to qubit loss, and define partial identities (which can be\northogonal), partial unitarity, and partially bounded operators (which can be\nnon-invertible). We define two classes of matrices, the star and circle types,\nand find that the magic matrices (connected with the Cartan decomposition)\nbelong to the star class. The general algebraic structure of the classes\nintroduced here is described in terms of semigroups, ternary and 5-ary groups\nand modules. The higher braid group and its representation by higher braid\noperators are given. Finally, we show that for each multi-qubit state there\nexist higher braiding gates which are not entangling, and the concrete\nconditions to be non-entangling are given for the binary and ternary gates\ndiscussed.",

We apply the\nsparsity algorithm to provide a simple suggestion to publicly traded companies\nin order to improve their credit ratings. We validate the sparsity algorithm\nwith a synthetically generated dataset and we further apply it to quarterly\nfinancial statements from companies in financial, healthcare and IT sectors of\nthe US market.

To the best of the author's\nknowledge, this is the first method to precisely estimate upto 25 skeletal\nkey-points using mmWave radar data alone. Skeletal pose estimation is critical\nin several applications ranging from autonomous vehicles, traffic monitoring,\npatient monitoring, gait analysis, to defense security forensics, and aid both\npreventative and actionable decision making. The use of mmWave radars for this\ntask, over traditionally employed optical sensors, provide several advantages,\nprimarily its operational robustness to scene lighting and adverse weather\nconditions, where optical sensor performance degrade significantly. The mmWave\nradar point-cloud (PCL) data is first voxelized (analogous to tokenization in\nNLP) and $N$ frames of the voxelized radar data (analogous to a text paragraph\nin NLP) is subjected to the proposed mmPose-NLP architecture, where the voxel\nindices of the 25 skeletal key-points (analogous to keyword extraction in NLP)\nare predicted. The voxel indices are converted back to real world 3-D\ncoordinates using the voxel dictionary used during the tokenization process.\nMean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics were used to measure the accuracy of the\nproposed system against the ground truth, with the proposed mmPose-NLP offering\n<3 cm localization errors in the depth, horizontal and vertical axes. The\neffect of the number of input frames vs performance/accuracy was also studied\nfor N = {1,2,..,10}. A comprehensive methodology, results, discussions and\nlimitations are presented in this paper.

The blood\nsera of cancer patients are enriched with heterogeneous secretory lipid bound\nextracellular vesicles (EVs), which present a complex repertoire of information\nand biomarkers, representing their cell of origin, that are being currently\nstudied in the field of liquid biopsy and cancer screening. Vibrational\nspectroscopies provide non-invasive approaches for the assessment of structural\nand biophysical properties in complex biological samples. In this study,\nmultiple Raman spectroscopy measurements were performed on the EVs extracted\nfrom the blood sera of 9 patients consisting of four different cancer subtypes\n(colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer and pancreatic\ncancer) and five healthy patients (controls). FTIR(Fourier Transform Infrared)\nspectroscopy measurements were performed as a complementary approach to Raman\nanalysis, on two of the four cancer subtypes.\nThe AdaBoost Random Forest Classifier, Decision Trees, and Support Vector\nMachines (SVM) distinguished the baseline corrected Raman spectra of cancer EVs\nfrom those of healthy controls (18 spectra) with a classification accuracy of\ngreater than 90% when reduced to a spectral frequency range of 1800 to 1940\ninverse cm, and subjected to a 0.5 training/testing split. FTIR classification\naccuracy on 14 spectra showed an 80% classification accuracy.

    "abstract": "Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) is a non-invasive and\nnon-contacting imaging technique providing visualization of microvasculature of\nretina and optic nerve head in human eyes in vivo. The adequate image quality\nof OCTA is the prerequisite for the subsequent quantification of retinal\nmicrovasculature. Traditionally, the image quality score based on signal\nstrength is used for discriminating low quality. However, it is insufficient\nfor identifying artefacts such as motion and off-centration, which rely\nspecialized knowledge and need tedious and time-consuming manual\nidentification. One of the most primary issues in OCTA analysis is to sort out\nthe foveal avascular zone (FAZ) region in the retina, which highly correlates\nwith any visual acuity disease. However, the variations in OCTA visual quality\naffect the performance of deep learning in any downstream marginally. Moreover,\nfiltering the low-quality OCTA images out is both labor-intensive and\ntime-consuming. To address these issues, we develop an automated computer-aided\nOCTA image processing system using deep neural networks as the classifier and\nsegmentor to help ophthalmologists in clinical diagnosis and research. This\nsystem can be an assistive tool as it can process OCTA images of different\nformats to assess the quality and segment the FAZ area.

    "abstract": "In recent years, light field (LF) capture and processing has become an\nintegral part of media production. The richness of information available in LFs\nhas enabled novel applications like post-capture depth-of-field editing, 3D\nreconstruction, segmentation and matting, saliency detection, object detection\nand recognition, and mixed reality. The efficacy of such applications depends\non certain underlying requirements, which are often ignored. For example, some\noperations such as noise-reduction, or hyperfan-filtering are only possible if\na scene point Lambertian radiator. Some other operations such as the removal of\nobstacles or looking behind objects are only possible if there is at least one\nray capturing the required scene point. Consequently, the ray distribution\nrepresenting a certain scene point is an important characteristic for\nevaluating processing possibilities. The primary idea in this paper is to\nestablish a relation between the capturing setup and the rays of the LF. To\nthis end, we discretize the view frustum. Traditionally, a uniform\ndiscretization of the view frustum results in voxels that represents a single\nsample on a regularly spaced, 3-D grid. Instead, we use frustum-shaped voxels\n(froxels), by using depth and capturing-setup dependent discretization of the\nview frustum. Based on such discretization, we count the number of rays mapping\nto the same pixel on the capturing device(s). By means of this count, we\npropose histograms of ray-counts over the froxels (fristograms). Fristograms\ncan be used as a tool to analyze and reveal interesting aspects of the\nunderlying LF, like the number of rays originating from a scene point and the\ncolor distribution of these rays. As an example, we show its ability by\nsignificantly reducing the number of rays which enables noise reduction while\nmaintaining the realistic rendering of non-Lambertian or partially occluded\nregions.",

    "title": "An overcome of far-distance limitation on tunnel CCTV-based accident  detection in AI deep-learning frameworks",
    "abstract": "Tunnel CCTVs are installed to low height and long-distance interval. However,\nbecause of the limitation of installation height, severe perspective effect in\ndistance occurs, and it is almost impossible to detect vehicles in far distance\nfrom the CCTV in the existing tunnel CCTV-based accident detection system\n(Pflugfelder 2005). To overcome the limitation, a vehicle object is detected\nthrough an object detection algorithm based on an inverse perspective transform\nby re-setting the region of interest (ROI). It can detect vehicles that are far\naway from the CCTV. To verify this process, this paper creates each dataset\nconsisting of images and bounding boxes based on the original and warped images\nof the CCTV at the same time, and then compares performance of the deep\nlearning object detection models trained with the two datasets. As a result,\nthe model that trained the warped image was able to detect vehicle objects more\naccurately at the position far from the CCTV compared to the model that trained\nthe original image.",

Theoretically, we show that\npredictions on newdata from all K models belong to the same predictive\nposterior distribution under a neural tangent kernel regime.

Recent advances have shown great promise in applying graph\nneural networks (GNNs) for better affinity prediction by learning the\nrepresentations of protein-ligand complexes.

To this\nend, we propose a structure-aware interactive graph neural network (SIGN) which\nconsists of two components: polar-inspired graph attention layers (PGAL) and\npairwise interactive pooling (PiPool). Specifically, PGAL iteratively performs\nthe node-edge aggregation process to update embeddings of nodes and edges while\npreserving the distance and angle information among atoms.

Different from prior works,\neither component here doesn't need to perform pre-training and fine-tuning\nprocesses separately. Through analysis, we found that the success of the\nproposed method lies in the following aspects. Firstly, multitask learning is\nessential, that is the SE network is not only learning to produce more\nIntelligent speech, it is also aimed to generate speech that is beneficial to\nrecognition. Secondly, we also found speech phase preserved from noisy speech\nis critical for improving ASR performance. Thirdly, we propose a dual channel\ndata augmentation training method to obtain further improvement.Specifically,\nwe combine the clean and enhanced speech to train the whole system. We evaluate\nthe proposed method on the RATS English data set, achieving a relative WER\nreduction of 4.6% with the joint training method, and up to a relative WER\nreduction of 11.2% with the proposed data augmentation method.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a framework for modeling failure in quasi-brittle\ngeomaterials under different loading conditions. A micromechanics-based model\nis proposed in which the field variables are linked to physical mechanisms at\nthe microcrack level: damage is related to the growth of microcracks, while\nplasticity is related to the frictional sliding of closed microcracks.\nConsequently, the hardening/softening functions and parameters entering the\nfree energy follow from the definition of a single degradation function and the\nelastic material properties. The evolution of opening microcracks in tension\nleads to brittle behavior and mode I fracture, while the evolution of closed\nmicrocracks under frictional sliding in compression/shear leads to ductile\nbehavior and mode II fracture. Frictional sliding is endowed with a\nnon-associative law, a crucial aspect of the model that considers the effect of\ndilation and allows for realistic material responses with non-vanishing\nfrictional energy dissipation. Despite the non-associative law, a variationally\nconsistent formulation is presented using notions of energy balance and\nstability, following the energetic formulation for rate-independent systems.\nThe material response of the model is first described, followed by several\nbenchmark finite element simulations. The results highlight the ability of the\nmodel to describe tensile, shear, and mixed-mode fracture, as well as responses\nwith brittle-to-ductile transition. A key result is that, by virtue of the\nmicromechanical arguments, realistic failure modes can be captured, without\nresorting to the usual heuristic modifications considered in the phase-field\nliterature. The numerical results are thoroughly discussed with reference to\nprevious numerical studies, experimental evidence, and analytical fracture\ncriteria.",

Accurate segmentation of cardiac structures from cine\nMRI is a crucial step for early diagnosis and prognosis of CVD, and has been\ngreatly improved with convolutional neural networks (CNN).

Moreover, the MRPN concept shows its potential for\nmulti-modal classifiers dealing with signal sources not only of optical and\nacoustical type.",

    "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) is crucial for the monitoring and diagnosis of\nbrain disorders. However, EEG signals suffer from perturbations caused by\nnon-cerebral artifacts limiting their efficacy. Current artifact detection\npipelines are resource-hungry and rely heavily on hand-crafted features.\nMoreover, these pipelines are deterministic in nature, making them unable to\ncapture predictive uncertainty. We propose E4G, a deep learning framework for\nhigh frequency EEG artifact detection. Our framework exploits the early exit\nparadigm, building an implicit ensemble of models capable of capturing\nuncertainty. We evaluate our approach on the Temple University Hospital EEG\nArtifact Corpus (v2.0) achieving state-of-the-art classification results. In\naddition, E4G provides well-calibrated uncertainty metrics comparable to\nsampling techniques like Monte Carlo dropout in just a single forward pass. E4G\nopens the door to uncertainty-aware artifact detection supporting\nclinicians-in-the-loop frameworks.",

We evaluate the required overhead in terms of input dimension\nand precision, which reveals that the algorithm depends on the roughly square\nroot of input dimension and achieves an exponential speedup on precision\ncompared with previous work.

However, the lack of interpretability of these algorithms\nmay hinder their applicability to medical decision support systems. This paper\nstudies an interpretable deep learning technique, called SincNet. SincNet is a\nconvolutional neural network that efficiently learns customized band-pass\nfilters through trainable sinc-functions. In this study, we use SincNet to\nanalyze the neural activity of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD),\nwho experience characteristic differences in neural oscillatory activity. In\nparticular, we propose a novel SincNet-based neural network for detecting\nemotions in ASD patients using EEG signals. The learned filters can be easily\ninspected to detect which part of the EEG spectrum is used for predicting\nemotions. We found that our system automatically learns the high-$\\alpha$ (9-13\nHz) and $\\beta$ (13-30 Hz) band suppression often present in individuals with\nASD. This result is consistent with recent neuroscience studies on emotion\nrecognition, which found an association between these band suppressions and the\nbehavioral deficits observed in individuals with ASD. The improved\ninterpretability of SincNet is achieved without sacrificing performance in\nemotion recognition.",

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer diagnosed among men\nworldwide. The current PCa diagnostic pathway comes at the cost of substantial\noverdiagnosis, leading to unnecessary treatment and further testing.\nBi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (bp-MRI) based on apparent diffusion\ncoefficient maps (ADC) and T2-weighted (T2w) sequences has been proposed as a\ntriage test to differentiate between clinically significant (cS) and\nnon-clinically significant (ncS) prostate lesions. However, analysis of the\nsequences relies on expertise, requires specialized training, and suffers from\ninter-observer variability. Deep learning (DL) techniques hold promise in tasks\nsuch as classification and detection. Nevertheless, they rely on large amounts\nof annotated data which is not common in the medical field. In order to\npalliate such issues, existing works rely on transfer learning (TL) and\nImageNet pre-training, which has been proven to be sub-optimal for the medical\nimaging domain. In this paper, we present a patch-based pre-training strategy\nto distinguish between cS and ncS lesions which exploit the region of interest\n(ROI) of the patched source domain to efficiently train a classifier in the\nfull-slice target domain which does not require annotations by making use of\ntransfer learning (TL). We provide a comprehensive comparison between several\nCNNs architectures and different settings which are presented as a baseline.\nMoreover, we explore cross-domain TL which exploits both MRI modalities and\nimproves single modality results.

Limited research efforts have explored a higher level of\noptimization by making the quantum circuit resilient to noise. We propose and\nexperimentally implement QuantumNAS, the first comprehensive framework for\nnoise-adaptive co-search of variational circuit and qubit mapping. Variational\nquantum circuits are a promising approach for constructing quantum neural\nnetworks for machine learning and variational ansatzes for quantum simulation.\nHowever, finding the best variational circuit and its optimal parameters is\nchallenging in a high-dimensional Hilbert space. We propose to decouple the\nparameter training and circuit search by introducing a novel gate-sharing\nSuperCircuit. The SuperCircuit is trained by sampling and updating the\nSubCircuits in it and provides an accurate estimation of SubCircuit performance\ntrained from scratch. Then we perform an evolutionary co-search of SubCircuit\nand its qubit mapping. The SubCircuit performance is estimated with parameters\ninherited from SuperCircuit and simulated with real device noise models.\nFinally, we perform iterative gate pruning and finetuning to further remove the\nredundant gates in a fine-grained manner.\nExtensively evaluated with 12 QML and VQE benchmarks on 10 quantum computers,\nQuantumNAS significantly outperforms noise-unaware search, human and random\nbaselines. For QML tasks, QuantumNAS is the first to demonstrate over 95%\n2-class, 85% 4-class, and 32% 10-class classification accuracy on real quantum\ncomputers. It also achieves the lowest eigenvalue for VQE tasks on H2, H2O,\nLiH, CH4, BeH2 compared with UCCSD baselines.
