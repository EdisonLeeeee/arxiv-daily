How information is provided to users and their\nbehavior plays a central role in such configurations.

The model is applied on a case study\nbased on a stated preference survey for a segment of Paris suburban train\nnetwork. We systematically explore the parameter space and show non-trivial\npatterns of congestion for some values of discrete choice parameters linked to\nperceived wait time and congestion. We also apply a genetic optimisation\nalgorithm to the model to search for optimal compromises between congestion in\ndifferent modes.",

    "abstract": "With the rise of deep neural networks, the challenge of explaining the\npredictions of these networks has become increasingly recognized. While many\nmethods for explaining the decisions of deep neural networks exist, there is\ncurrently no consensus on how to evaluate them. On the other hand, robustness\nis a popular topic for deep learning research; however, it is hardly talked\nabout in explainability until very recently. In this tutorial paper, we start\nby presenting gradient-based interpretability methods. These techniques use\ngradient signals to assign the burden of the decision on the input features.\nLater, we discuss how gradient-based methods can be evaluated for their\nrobustness and the role that adversarial robustness plays in having meaningful\nexplanations. We also discuss the limitations of gradient-based methods.\nFinally, we present the best practices and attributes that should be examined\nbefore choosing an explainability method. We conclude with the future\ndirections for research in the area at the convergence of robustness and\nexplainability.",

MARS consists of a generic user-level sensing/actuation\ninterface that allows for portable policy design, and a reflective system model\nused to coordinate multiple policies.

    "abstract": "About 26% of total U.S. energy consumption is used in the transportation\nsector. Conventional vehicles use fuels such as gasoline, emit harmful gases,\nand have adverse effects on the environment. Electric vehicles (EVs) provide an\nalternative solution that decreases the dependency on traditional fuels such as\ngasoline and reduces hazardous gas emissions. EVs can drive longer distances by\nemploying dynamic wireless power transfer systems (DWPT) without increasing\ntheir battery size or having stopovers. Additionally, developing a decision\nsystem that avoids an excessive load on the power grid is essential. These\ndecision systems are particularly beneficial for autonomous driving for\npersonal and public transportation. This study briefly reviews the available\nliterature in dynamic wireless power transfer systems and proposes a novel\nsystem-level mathematical decision model to find the optimal profile for\nwireless charging infrastructures. We analyze the role of renewable energy\nintegration on DWPT systems and identify the framework, benefits, and\nchallenges in implementing DWPT for EVs. The mathematical model is\nmixed-integer, multi-period, and linear, minimizing the total system cost while\nsatisfying the systems requirements. The proposed model and the case study\nanalysis in this research determine the near-optimal plan for DWPT\ninfrastructure allocations and pave the road toward a more detailed power grid\nand renewable energy integration. Our result indicates that renewable energies\ncan significantly decrease the DWPT total system cost, infrastructure\nrequirements and increase the EVs' reliability.

In this work, we develop a more accurate\nweakly-supervised solution by introducing Cross-Sentence Relations Mining (CRM)\nin video moment proposal generation and matching when only a paragraph\ndescription of activities without per-sentence temporal annotation is\navailable. Specifically, we explore two cross-sentence relational constraints:\n(1) Temporal ordering and (2) semantic consistency among sentences in a\nparagraph description of video activities. Existing weakly-supervised\ntechniques only consider within-sentence video segment correlations in training\nwithout considering cross-sentence paragraph context.

Very recently,\nexploration methods that consider cooperation among multiple agents have been\ndeveloped. However, existing methods suffer from a common challenge: agents\nstruggle to identify states that are worth exploring, and hardly coordinate\nexploration efforts toward those states. To address this shortcoming, in this\npaper, we propose cooperative multi-agent exploration (CMAE): agents share a\ncommon goal while exploring. The goal is selected from multiple projected state\nspaces via a normalized entropy-based technique. Then, agents are trained to\nreach this goal in a coordinated manner. We demonstrate that CMAE consistently\noutperforms baselines on various tasks, including a sparse-reward version of\nthe multiple-particle environment (MPE) and the Starcraft multi-agent challenge\n(SMAC).",

    "abstract": "Neural networks are increasingly being deployed in contexts where safety is a\ncritical concern. In this work, we propose a way to construct neural network\nclassifiers that dynamically repair violations of non-relational safety\nconstraints called safe ordering properties. Safe ordering properties relate\nrequirements on the ordering of a network's output indices to conditions on\ntheir input, and are sufficient to express most useful notions of\nnon-relational safety for classifiers. Our approach is based on a novel\nself-repairing layer, which provably yields safe outputs regardless of the\ncharacteristics of its input. We compose this layer with an existing network to\nconstruct a self-repairing network (SR-Net), and show that in addition to\nproviding safe outputs, the SR-Net is guaranteed to preserve the accuracy of\nthe original network. Notably, our approach is independent of the size and\narchitecture of the network being repaired, depending only on the specified\nproperty and the dimension of the network's output; thus it is scalable to\nlarge state-of-the-art networks. We show that our approach can be implemented\nusing vectorized computations that execute efficiently on a GPU, introducing\nrun-time overhead of less than one millisecond on current hardware -- even on\nlarge, widely-used networks containing hundreds of thousands of neurons and\nmillions of parameters.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning methods are the de-facto solutions to a multitude of medical\nimage analysis tasks. Cardiac MRI segmentation is one such application which,\nlike many others, requires a large number of annotated data so a trained\nnetwork can generalize well. Unfortunately, the process of having a large\nnumber of manually curated images by medical experts is both slow and utterly\nexpensive. In this paper, we set out to explore whether expert knowledge is a\nstrict requirement for the creation of annotated datasets that machine learning\ncan successfully train on. To do so, we gauged the performance of three\nsegmentation models, namely U-Net, Attention U-Net, and ENet, trained with\ndifferent loss functions on expert and non-expert groundtruth for cardiac\ncine-MRI segmentation. Evaluation was done with classic segmentation metrics\n(Dice index and Hausdorff distance) as well as clinical measurements, such as\nthe ventricular ejection fractions and the myocardial mass. Results reveal that\ngeneralization performances of a segmentation neural network trained on\nnon-expert groundtruth data is, to all practical purposes, as good as on expert\ngroundtruth data, in particular when the non-expert gets a decent level of\ntraining, highlighting an opportunity for the efficient and cheap creation of\nannotations for cardiac datasets.",

    "title": "Applying Inter-rater Reliability and Agreement in Grounded Theory  Studies in Software Engineering",
    "abstract": "In recent years, the qualitative research on empirical software engineering\nthat applies Grounded Theory is increasing. Grounded Theory (GT) is a technique\nfor developing theory inductively e iteratively from qualitative data based on\ntheoretical sampling, coding, constant comparison, memoing, and saturation, as\nmain characteristics. Large or controversial GT studies may involve multiple\nresearchers in collaborative coding, which requires a kind of rigor and\nconsensus that an individual coder does not. Although many qualitative\nresearchers reject quantitative measures in favor of other qualitative\ncriteria, many others are committed to measuring consensus through Inter-Rater\nReliability (IRR) and/or Inter-Rater Agreement (IRA) techniques to develop a\nshared understanding of the phenomenon being studied. However, there are no\nspecific guidelines about how and when to apply IRR/IRA during the iterative\nprocess of GT, so researchers have been using ad hoc methods for years. This\npaper presents a process for systematically applying IRR/IRA in GT studies that\nmeets the iterative nature of this qualitative research method, which is\nsupported by a previous systematic literature review on applying IRR/RA in GT\nstudies in software engineering. This process allows researchers to\nincrementally generate a theory while ensuring consensus on the constructs that\nsupport it and, thus, improving the rigor of qualitative research. This\nformalization helps researchers to apply IRR/IRA to GT studies when various\nraters are involved in coding. Measuring consensus among raters promotes\ncommunicability, transparency, reflexivity, replicability, and trustworthiness\nof the research.",

This work investigates the feasibility\nand performance of an automatic detection system to count noise events. An\nempirical evaluation was done by collecting data at a newly constructed\nshooting range and training facility. The data includes tests of multiple\nweapon configurations from small firearms to high caliber rifles and\nexplosives, at multiple source positions, and collected on multiple different\ndays.

A single laser pulse can be\npartially reflected by multiple objects along its path, resulting in multiple\nmeasurements called echoes. Multi-echo measurement can provide information\nabout object contours and semi-transparent surfaces which can be used to better\nidentify and locate objects. LiDAR can also measure surface reflectance\n(intensity of laser pulse return), as well as ambient light of the scene\n(sunlight reflected by objects). These signals are already available in\ncommercial LiDAR devices but have not been used in most LiDAR-based detection\nmodels. We present a 3D object detection model which leverages the full\nspectrum of measurement signals provided by LiDAR. First, we propose a\nmulti-signal fusion (MSF) module to combine (1) the reflectance and ambient\nfeatures extracted with a 2D CNN, and (2) point cloud features extracted using\na 3D graph neural network (GNN). Second, we propose a multi-echo aggregation\n(MEA) module to combine the information encoded in different set of echo\npoints.

Hyperbolic Neural Networks (HNNs) that operate directly\nin hyperbolic space have also been proposed recently to further exploit the\npotential of hyperbolic representations. While HNNs have achieved better\nperformance than Euclidean neural networks (ENNs) on datasets with implicit\nhierarchical structure, they still perform poorly on standard classification\nbenchmarks such as CIFAR and ImageNet. The traditional wisdom is that it is\ncritical for the data to respect the hyperbolic geometry when applying HNNs. In\nthis paper, we first conduct an empirical study showing that the inferior\nperformance of HNNs on standard recognition datasets can be attributed to the\nnotorious vanishing gradient problem. We further discovered that this problem\nstems from the hybrid architecture of HNNs. Our analysis leads to a simple yet\neffective solution called Feature Clipping, which regularizes the hyperbolic\nembedding whenever its norm exceeding a given threshold. Our thorough\nexperiments show that the proposed method can successfully avoid the vanishing\ngradient problem when training HNNs with backpropagation.

This paper develops a computationally efficient framework for (fast)\ninverse design of LREM, by integrating a new type of machine learning models\ncalled invertible neural networks or INN. An INN can be trained to predict the\nbandgap bounds as a function of the unit cell design, and interestingly at the\nsame time it learns to predict the unit cell design given a bandgap, when\nexecuted in reverse. In our case the unit cells are represented in terms of the\nwidth's of the outer matrix and middle soft filler layer of the unit cell.\nTraining data on the frequency response of the unit cell is provided by Bloch\ndispersion analyses. The trained INN is used to instantaneously retrieve\nfeasible (or near feasible) inverse designs given a specified bandgap\nconstraint, which is then used to initialize a forward constrained optimization\n(based on sequential quadratic programming) to find the bandgap satisfying unit\ncell with minimum mass. Case studies show favorable performance of this\napproach, in terms of the bandgap characteristics and minimized mass, when\ncompared to the median scenario over ten randomly initialized optimizations for\nthe same specified bandgaps.

    "abstract": "Computer graphics seeks to deliver compelling images, generated within a\ncomputing budget, targeted at a specific display device, and ultimately viewed\nby an individual user. The foveated nature of human vision offers an\nopportunity to efficiently allocate computation and compression to appropriate\nareas of the viewer's visual field, especially with the rise of high resolution\nand wide field-of-view display devices. However, while the ongoing study of\nfoveal vision is advanced, much less is known about how humans process imagery\nin the periphery of their vision -- which comprises, at any given moment, the\nvast majority of the pixels in the image. We advance computational models for\nperipheral vision aimed toward their eventual use in computer graphics. In\nparticular, we present a dataflow computational model of peripheral encoding\nthat is more efficient than prior pooling - based methods and more compact than\ncontrast sensitivity-based methods. Further, we account for the explicit\nencoding of \"end stopped\" features in the image, which was missing from\nprevious methods. Finally, we evaluate our model in the context of perception\nof textures in the periphery. Our improved peripheral encoding may simplify\ndevelopment and testing of more sophisticated, complete models in more robust\nand realistic settings relevant to computer graphics.",

    "abstract": "Learning from imbalanced data is among the most challenging areas in\ncontemporary machine learning. This becomes even more difficult when considered\nthe context of big data that calls for dedicated architectures capable of\nhigh-performance processing. Apache Spark is a highly efficient and popular\narchitecture, but it poses specific challenges for algorithms to be implemented\nfor it. While oversampling algorithms are an effective way for handling class\nimbalance, they have not been designed for distributed environments. In this\npaper, we propose a holistic look on oversampling algorithms for imbalanced big\ndata. We discuss the taxonomy of oversampling algorithms and their mechanisms\nused to handle skewed class distributions. We introduce a Spark library with 14\nstate-of-the-art oversampling algorithms implemented and evaluate their\nefficacy via extensive experimental study. Using binary and multi-class massive\ndata sets, we analyze the effectiveness of oversampling algorithms and their\nrelationships with different types of classifiers. We evaluate the trade-off\nbetween accuracy and time complexity of oversampling algorithms, as well as\ntheir scalability when increasing the size of data. This allows us to gain\ninsight into the usefulness of specific components of oversampling algorithms\nfor big data, as well as formulate guidelines and recommendations for designing\nfuture resampling approaches for massive imbalanced data.

    "abstract": "Phase Change Memory (PCM) is an attractive candidate for main memory as it\noffers non-volatility and zero leakage power, while providing higher cell\ndensities, longer data retention time, and higher capacity scaling compared to\nDRAM. In PCM, data is stored in the crystalline or amorphous state of the phase\nchange material. The typical electrically-controlled PCM (EPCM), however,\nsuffers from longer write latency and higher write energy compared to DRAM and\nlimited multi-level cell (MLC) capacities. These challenges limit the\nperformance of data-intensive applications running on computing systems with\nEPCMs.\nRecently, researchers demonstrated optically-controlled PCM (OPCM) cells,\nwith support for 5 bits/cell in contrast to 2 bits/cell in EPCM. These OPCM\ncells can be accessed directly with optical signals that are multiplexed in\nhigh-bandwidth-density silicon-photonic links. The higher MLC capacity in OPCM\nand the direct cell access using optical signals enable an increased read/write\nthroughput and lower energy per access than EPCM. However, due to the direct\ncell access using optical signals, OPCM systems cannot be designed using\nconventional memory architecture. We need a complete redesign of the memory\narchitecture that is tailored to the properties of OPCM technology.\nThis paper presents the design of a unified network and main memory system\ncalled COSMOS that combines OPCM and silicon-photonic links to achieve high\nmemory throughput. COSMOS is composed of a hierarchical multi-banked OPCM array\nwith novel read and write access protocols, and uses an\nElectrical-Optical-Electrical (E-O-E) control unit to interface with the\nprocessor. Our evaluation of a 2.5D-integrated system containing a processor\nand COSMOS demonstrates 2.14x average speedup compared to an EPCM system.\nCOSMOS consumes 3.8x lower read energy-per-bit and 5.97x lower write\nenergy-per-bit compared to EPCM.",

To address these difficulties, square kernel-based encoder-decoder\narchitecture has been proposed and widely used, but its performance remains\nstill unsatisfactory. To further cope with these challenges, we present a novel\ndouble-branch encoder architecture. Our architecture is inspired by two\nobservations: 1) Since the discrimination of features learned via square\nconvolutional kernels needs to be further improved, we propose to utilize\nnon-square vertical and horizontal convolutional kernels in the double-branch\nencoder, so features learned by the two branches can be expected to complement\neach other. 2) Considering that spatial attention can help models to better\nfocus on the target region in a large-sized image, we develop an attention loss\nto further emphasize the segmentation on small-sized targets. Together, the\nabove two schemes give rise to a novel double-branch encoder segmentation\nframework for medical image segmentation, namely Crosslink-Net.

This task\nis quite challenging and has not been fully studied to date. Current works\nmainly focus on body shape or contour sketch, but they are not robust enough\ndue to view and posture variations. The key to this task is to exploit\ncloth-irrelevant cues. This paper proposes a semantic-guided pixel sampling\napproach for the cloth-changing person re-ID task. We do not explicitly define\nwhich feature to extract but force the model to automatically learn\ncloth-irrelevant cues. Specifically, we first recognize the pedestrian's upper\nclothes and pants, then randomly change them by sampling pixels from other\npedestrians. The changed samples retain the identity labels but exchange the\npixels of clothes or pants among different pedestrians. Besides, we adopt a\nloss function to constrain the learned features to keep consistent before and\nafter changes. In this way, the model is forced to learn cues that are\nirrelevant to upper clothes and pants. We conduct extensive experiments on the\nlatest released PRCC dataset. Our method achieved 65.8% on Rank1 accuracy,\nwhich outperforms previous methods with a large margin. The code is available\nat https://github.com/shuxjweb/pixel_sampling.git.",

    "abstract": "An immersive audio-visual experience in games and virtual reality requires\nfast calculation of diffraction-based acoustic effects. To maintain\nplausibility, the effects must retain spatial smoothness on source and listener\nmotion within geometrically complex scenes. Precomputed wave-based techniques\ncan render such results at low runtime CPU cost, but remain limited to static\nscenes. Modeling the occlusion effect of dynamic portals such as doors present\nan unresolved challenge to maintain audio-visual consistency. We present a fast\nsolution implementable as a drop-in extension to existing precomputed systems.\nKey is a novel portal-search method that leverages precomputed propagation\ndelay and direction data to find portals intervening the diffracted shortest\npath connecting dynamic source and listener at runtime. The method scales\nlinearly with number of portals in worst case, far cheaper than explicit global\npath search that scales with scene area. We discuss culling techniques to\naccelerate further. The search algorithm is combined with geometric-acoustic\napproximations to model the additional direct and indirect energy loss from\nintervening portals depending on their dynamic closure state. We demonstrate\nplausible audio-visual animations within our system integrated with Unreal\nEngine 4 (TM) and Wwise (TM).",

    "abstract": "Person re-identification is the challenging task of identifying a person\nacross different camera views. Training a convolutional neural network (CNN)\nfor this task requires annotating a large dataset, and hence, it involves the\ntime-consuming manual matching of people across cameras. To reduce the need for\nlabeled data, we focus on a semi-supervised approach that requires only a\nsubset of the training data to be labeled. We conduct a comprehensive survey in\nthe area of person re-identification with limited labels. Existing works in\nthis realm are limited in the sense that they utilize features from multiple\nCNNs and require the number of identities in the unlabeled data to be known. To\novercome these limitations, we propose to employ part-based features from a\nsingle CNN without requiring the knowledge of the label space (i.e., the number\nof identities). This makes our approach more suitable for practical scenarios,\nand it significantly reduces the need for computational resources. We also\npropose a PartMixUp loss that improves the discriminative ability of learned\npart-based features for pseudo-labeling in semi-supervised settings. Our method\noutperforms the state-of-the-art results on three large-scale person re-id\ndatasets and achieves the same level of performance as fully supervised methods\nwith only one-third of labeled identities.",

To reduce the\npunctuation errors generated by the ASR model, we employ our previous work\nSlotRefine to train a punctuation correction model. To achieve better\ntranslation performance, we explored the most recent effective strategies,\nincluding back translation, knowledge distillation, multi-feature reranking and\ntransductive finetuning. For model structure, we tried auto-regressive and\nnon-autoregressive models, respectively.

    "abstract": "Encouraging progress has been made towards Visual Question Answering (VQA) in\nrecent years, but it is still challenging to enable VQA models to adaptively\ngeneralize to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Intuitively, recompositions of\nexisting visual concepts (i.e., attributes and objects) can generate unseen\ncompositions in the training set, which will promote VQA models to generalize\nto OOD samples. In this paper, we formulate OOD generalization in VQA as a\ncompositional generalization problem and propose a graph generative\nmodeling-based training scheme (X-GGM) to handle the problem implicitly. X-GGM\nleverages graph generative modeling to iteratively generate a relation matrix\nand node representations for the predefined graph that utilizes\nattribute-object pairs as nodes. Furthermore, to alleviate the unstable\ntraining issue in graph generative modeling, we propose a gradient distribution\nconsistency loss to constrain the data distribution with adversarial\nperturbations and the generated distribution. The baseline VQA model (LXMERT)\ntrained with the X-GGM scheme achieves state-of-the-art OOD performance on two\nstandard VQA OOD benchmarks, i.e., VQA-CP v2 and GQA-OOD.

Due to the constrained bandwidth,\nonly a subset of devices can upload their updates at each communication round.\nThis has led to an active research area in FEEL studying the optimal device\nscheduling policy for minimizing communication time. However, owing to the\ndifficulty in quantifying the exact communication time, prior work in this area\ncan only tackle the problem partially by considering either the communication\nrounds or per-round latency, while the total communication time is determined\nby both metrics. To close this gap, we make the first attempt in this paper to\nformulate and solve the communication time minimization problem. We first\nderive a tight bound to approximate the communication time through\ncross-disciplinary effort involving both learning theory for convergence\nanalysis and communication theory for per-round latency analysis. Building on\nthe analytical result, an optimized probabilistic scheduling policy is derived\nin closed-form by solving the approximate communication time minimization\nproblem. It is found that the optimized policy gradually turns its priority\nfrom suppressing the remaining communication rounds to reducing per-round\nlatency as the training process evolves.

    "abstract": "Smart contract vulnerability detection draws extensive attention in recent\nyears due to the substantial losses caused by hacker attacks. Existing efforts\nfor contract security analysis heavily rely on rigid rules defined by experts,\nwhich are labor-intensive and non-scalable. More importantly, expert-defined\nrules tend to be error-prone and suffer the inherent risk of being cheated by\ncrafty attackers. Recent researches focus on the symbolic execution and formal\nanalysis of smart contracts for vulnerability detection, yet to achieve a\nprecise and scalable solution. Although several methods have been proposed to\ndetect vulnerabilities in smart contracts, there is still a lack of effort that\nconsiders combining expert-defined security patterns with deep neural networks.\nIn this paper, we explore using graph neural networks and expert knowledge for\nsmart contract vulnerability detection. Specifically, we cast the rich control-\nand data- flow semantics of the source code into a contract graph. To highlight\nthe critical nodes in the graph, we further design a node elimination phase to\nnormalize the graph. Then, we propose a novel temporal message propagation\nnetwork to extract the graph feature from the normalized graph, and combine the\ngraph feature with designed expert patterns to yield a final detection system.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on all the smart contracts that have source\ncode in Ethereum and VNT Chain platforms. Empirical results show significant\naccuracy improvements over the state-of-the-art methods on three types of\nvulnerabilities, where the detection accuracy of our method reaches 89.15%,\n89.02%, and 83.21% for reentrancy, timestamp dependence, and infinite loop\nvulnerabilities, respectively.",

The first approach investigated in this\npaper uses a one-dimensional (1-D) Z-complementary pair (ZCP), which is an\nextension of the 1-D Golay complementary pair (GCP) where the autocorrelations\nof constituent sequences are complementary within a zero correlation zone\n(ZCZ). The second approach involves directly generalized Boolean functions\n(which are important components with many applications, particularly in\n(symmetric) cryptography).

    "abstract": "The convolution operation is a powerful tool for feature extraction and plays\na prominent role in the field of computer vision. However, when targeting the\npixel-wise tasks like image fusion, it would not fully perceive the\nparticularity of each pixel in the image if the uniform convolution kernel is\nused on different patches. In this paper, we propose a local adaptive\nconvolution (LAConv), which is dynamically adjusted to different spatial\nlocations. LAConv enables the network to pay attention to every specific local\narea in the learning process. Besides, the dynamic bias (DYB) is introduced to\nprovide more possibilities for the depiction of features and make the network\nmore flexible. We further design a residual structure network equipped with the\nproposed LAConv and DYB modules, and apply it to two image fusion tasks.\nExperiments for pansharpening and hyperspectral image super-resolution (HISR)\ndemonstrate the superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art methods.\nIt is worth mentioning that LAConv can also be competent for other\nsuper-resolution tasks with less computation effort.",

In contrast to existing fixation-level or object-level\nsaliency detection tasks, we focus on multi-modal salient object detection\n(SOD), which mimics human attention mechanism by segmenting salient objects\nwith the guidance of audio-visual cues. To support this task, we collect the\nfirst large-scale dataset, named ASOD60K, which contains 4K-resolution video\nframes annotated with a six-level hierarchy, thus distinguishing itself with\nrichness, diversity and quality. Specifically, each sequence is marked with\nboth its super-/sub-class, with objects of each sub-class being further\nannotated with human eye fixations, bounding boxes, object-/instance-level\nmasks, and associated attributes (e.g., geometrical distortion).

While conventional human-visual inspection of casting products\nis slow and unproductive in mass productions, an automatic and reliable defect\ndetection not just enhances the quality control process but positively improves\nproductivity.

Convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) have been widely applied in both image classification and defect\ndetection tasks. Howbeit, CNNs with frequentist inference require a massive\namount of data to train on and still fall short in reporting beneficial\nestimates of their predictive uncertainty. Accordingly, leveraging the transfer\nlearning paradigm, we first apply four powerful CNN-based models (VGG16,\nResNet50, DenseNet121, and InceptionResNetV2) on a small dataset to extract\nmeaningful features. Extracted features are then processed by various machine\nlearning algorithms to perform the classification task. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that linear support vector machine (SVM) and multi-layer perceptron\n(MLP) show the finest performance in defect detection of casting images.\nSecondly, to achieve a reliable classification and to measure epistemic\nuncertainty, we employ an uncertainty quantification (UQ) technique (ensemble\nof MLP models) using features extracted from four pre-trained CNNs.

To further\nimprove the performance of these tasks, we propose a novel Hand Image\nUnderstanding (HIU) framework to extract comprehensive information of the hand\nobject from a single RGB image, by jointly considering the relationships\nbetween these tasks. To achieve this goal, a cascaded multi-task learning (MTL)\nbackbone is designed to estimate the 2D heat maps, to learn the segmentation\nmask, and to generate the intermediate 3D information encoding, followed by a\ncoarse-to-fine learning paradigm and a self-supervised learning strategy.\nQualitative experiments demonstrate that our approach is capable of recovering\nreasonable mesh representations even in challenging situations. Quantitatively,\nour method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on various\nwidely-used datasets, in terms of diverse evaluation metrics.",

    "abstract": "We propose Rank & Sort (RS) Loss, as a ranking-based loss function to train\ndeep object detection and instance segmentation methods (i.e. visual\ndetectors). RS Loss supervises the classifier, a sub-network of these methods,\nto rank each positive above all negatives as well as to sort positives among\nthemselves with respect to (wrt.) their continuous localisation qualities (e.g.\nIntersection-over-Union - IoU). To tackle the non-differentiable nature of\nranking and sorting, we reformulate the incorporation of error-driven update\nwith backpropagation as Identity Update, which enables us to model our novel\nsorting error among positives. With RS Loss, we significantly simplify\ntraining: (i) Thanks to our sorting objective, the positives are prioritized by\nthe classifier without an additional auxiliary head (e.g. for centerness, IoU,\nmask-IoU), (ii) due to its ranking-based nature, RS Loss is robust to class\nimbalance, and thus, no sampling heuristic is required, and (iii) we address\nthe multi-task nature of visual detectors using tuning-free task-balancing\ncoefficients. Using RS Loss, we train seven diverse visual detectors only by\ntuning the learning rate, and show that it consistently outperforms baselines:\ne.g. our RS Loss improves (i) Faster R-CNN by ~ 3 box AP and aLRP Loss\n(ranking-based baseline) by ~ 2 box AP on COCO dataset, (ii) Mask R-CNN with\nrepeat factor sampling (RFS) by 3.5 mask AP (~ 7 AP for rare classes) on LVIS\ndataset; and also outperforms all counterparts.

HLS tools can be used to deliver solutions for many\ndifferent kinds of design problems, which are often better solved with\ndifferent levels of abstraction. While existing HLS tools are built using\ncompiler infrastructures largely based on a single-level abstraction (e.g.,\nLLVM), we propose ScaleHLS, a next-generation HLS compilation flow, on top of a\nmulti-level compiler infrastructure called MLIR, for the first time. By using\nan intermediate representation (IR) that can be better tuned to particular\nalgorithms at different representation levels, we are able to build this new\nHLS tool that is more scalable and customizable towards various applications\ncoming with intrinsic structural or functional hierarchies. ScaleHLS is able to\nrepresent and optimize HLS designs at multiple levels of abstraction and\nprovides an HLS-dedicated transform and analysis library to solve the\noptimization problems at the suitable representation levels. On top of the\nlibrary, we also build an automated DSE engine to explore the multi-dimensional\ndesign space efficiently. In addition, we develop an HLS C front-end and a\nC/C++ emission back-end to translate HLS designs into/from MLIR for enabling\nthe end-to-end ScaleHLS flow.

We\nassume that the devices exploit different types of sensors to extract and\nprocess the respiration signal. We illustrate B2P for the case of two devices\nthat use respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP) and accelerometer\nsensors, respectively. Allowing for different types of sensors in pairing\nallows us to include wearable devices that use a variety of different sensors.\nIn practice, this form of sensor variety creates a number of challenges that\nlimit the ability of the shared-key establishment algorithm to generate\nmatching keys. The two main obstacles are the lack of synchronization across\nthe devices and the need for correct noise-induced mismatches between the\ngenerated key bit-strings.\nB2P addresses the synchronization challenge by utilizing Change Point\nDetection (CPD) to detect abrupt changes in the respiration signal and consider\ntheir occurrences as synchronizing points. Any potential mismatches are handled\nby optimal quantization and encoding of the respiration signal in order to\nmaximize the error correction rate and minimize the message overheads.\nExtensive evaluation on a dataset collected from 30 volunteers demonstrates\nthat our protocol can generate a secure 256-bit key every 2.85 seconds (around\none breathing cycle).

A number\nof publicly available datasets have been built with data from different\nhospitals and clinics. However, using models trained on these datasets for\nlater work on images sampled from a different hospital or clinic might result\nin lower performance.

Many users want to gain followers to increase the visibility\nand reach of their profiles to wide audiences. This has provoked several\nblackmarket services to garner huge attention by providing artificial followers\nvia the network of agreeable and compromised accounts in a collusive manner.\nTheir activity is difficult to detect as the blackmarket services shape their\nbehavior in such a way that users who are part of these services disguise\nthemselves as genuine users.\nIn this paper, we propose DECIFE, a framework to detect collusive users\ninvolved in producing 'following' activities through blackmarket services with\nthe intention to gain collusive followers in return. We first construct a\nheterogeneous user-tweet-topic network to leverage the follower/followee\nrelationships and linguistic properties of a user. The heterogeneous network is\nthen decomposed to form four different subgraphs that capture the semantic\nrelations between the users. An attention-based subgraph aggregation network is\nproposed to learn and combine the node representations from each subgraph. The\ncombined representation is finally passed on to a hypersphere learning\nobjective to detect collusive users. Comprehensive experiments on our curated\ndataset are conducted to validate the effectiveness of DECIFE by comparing it\nwith other state-of-the-art approaches.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we develop a sharp interface tumor growth model to study the\neffect of both the intratumoral structure using a controlled necrotic core and\nthe extratumoral nutrient supply from vasculature on tumor morphology. We first\nshow that our model extends the benchmark results in the literature using\nlinear stability analysis. Then we solve this generalized model numerically\nusing a spectrally accurate boundary integral method in an evolving annular\ndomain, not only with a Robin boundary condition on the outer boundary for the\nnutrient field which models tumor vasculature, but also with a static boundary\ncondition on the inner boundary for pressure field which models the control of\ntumor necrosis. The discretized linear systems for both pressure and nutrient\nfields are shown to be well-conditioned through tracing GMRES iteration\nnumbers. Our nonlinear simulations reveal the stabilizing effects of\nangiogenesis and the destabilizing ones of chemotaxis and necrosis in the\ndevelopment of tumor morphological instabilities if the necrotic core is fixed\nin a circular shape. When the necrotic core is controlled in a non-circular\nshape, the stabilizing effects of proliferation and the destabilizing ones of\napoptosis are observed. Finally, the values of the nutrient concentration with\nits fluxes and the pressure level with its normal derivatives, which are solved\naccurately at the boundaries, help us to characterize the corresponding tumor\nmorphology and the level of the biophysical quantities on interfaces required\nin keeping various shapes of the necrotic region of the tumor. Interestingly,\nwe notice that when the necrotic region is fixed in a 3-fold non-circular\nshape, even if the initial shape of the tumor is circular, the tumor will\nevolve into a shape corresponding to the 3-fold symmetry of the shape of the\nfixed necrotic region.",

This paper proposes a novel external balance mechanism for\nhumanoid robot to maintain sideway balance. First, a dynamic model of the\nhumanoid robot with balance mechanism and its simplified model are introduced.\nSecondly, a backstepping-based control method is utilized to split the system\ninto two sub-systems. Then, a minimum observer-based controller is used to\ncontrol the first sub-system. Since the second sub-system has unknown\nparameters, a model reference adaptive controller (MRAC) is used to control it.\nThe proposed design divides the walking and balancing into two separated tasks,\nallowing the walking control can be executed independently of the balancing\ncontrol. Furthermore, the use of the balance mechanism ensures the humanoid\nrobot's hip movement does not exceed the threshold of a human when walking.\nThus, making the overall pose of the humanoid robot looks more natural. An\nexperiment is carried out on a commercial humanoid robot known as UXA-90 to\nevaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "One of the main challenges in autonomous robotic exploration and navigation\nin unknown and unstructured environments is determining where the robot can or\ncannot safely move. A significant source of difficulty in this determination\narises from stochasticity and uncertainty, coming from localization error,\nsensor sparsity and noise, difficult-to-model robot-ground interactions, and\ndisturbances to the motion of the vehicle. Classical approaches to this problem\nrely on geometric analysis of the surrounding terrain, which can be prone to\nmodeling errors and can be computationally expensive. Moreover, modeling the\ndistribution of uncertain traversability costs is a difficult task, compounded\nby the various error sources mentioned above. In this work, we take a\nprincipled learning approach to this problem. We introduce a neural network\narchitecture for robustly learning the distribution of traversability costs.\nBecause we are motivated by preserving the life of the robot, we tackle this\nlearning problem from the perspective of learning tail-risks, i.e. the\nConditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). We show that this approach reliably learns\nthe expected tail risk given a desired probability risk threshold between 0 and\n1, producing a traversability costmap which is more robust to outliers, more\naccurately captures tail risks, and is more computationally efficient, when\ncompared against baselines.

Considering the\nachieved training accuracy of the global model as the utility of the selected\nworkers, which is typically a monotone submodular function, we formulate the\nworker selection problem as a new multi-round monotone submodular maximization\nproblem with cardinality and fairness constraints. The objective is to maximize\nthe time-average utility over multiple rounds subject to an additional fairness\nrequirement that each worker must be selected for a certain fraction of time.\nWhile the traditional submodular maximization with a cardinality constraint is\nalready a well-known NP-Hard problem, the fairness constraint in the\nmulti-round setting adds an extra layer of difficulty. To address this novel\nchallenge, we propose three algorithms: Fair Continuous Greedy (FairCG1 and\nFairCG2) and Fair Discrete Greedy (FairDG), all of which satisfy the fairness\nrequirement whenever feasible. Moreover, we prove nontrivial lower bounds on\nthe achieved time-average utility under FairCG1 and FairCG2. In addition, by\ngiving a higher priority to fairness, FairDG ensures a stronger short-term\nfairness guarantee, which holds in every round.

The objective is to minimize a\nglobal function that is a sum of the agents' local loss functions. And the\noptimization is conducted by analog over-the-air model training. Specifically,\neach agent modulates its local gradient onto a set of waveforms and transmits\nto the edge server simultaneously. From the received analog signal the edge\nserver extracts a noisy aggregated gradient which is distorted by the channel\nfading and interference, and uses it to update the global model and feedbacks\nto all the agents for another round of local computing. Since the\nelectromagnetic interference generally exhibits a heavy-tailed intrinsic, we\nuse the $\\alpha$-stable distribution to model its statistic. In consequence,\nthe global gradient has an infinite variance that hinders the use of\nconventional techniques for convergence analysis that rely on second-order\nmoments' existence. To circumvent this challenge, we take a new route to\nestablish the analysis of convergence rate, as well as generalization error, of\nthe algorithm. Our analyses reveal a two-sided effect of the interference on\nthe overall training procedure. On the negative side, heavy tail noise slows\ndown the convergence rate of the model training: the heavier the tail in the\ndistribution of interference, the slower the algorithm converges. On the\npositive side, heavy tail noise has the potential to increase the\ngeneralization power of the trained model: the heavier the tail, the better the\nmodel generalizes. This perhaps counterintuitive conclusion implies that the\nprevailing thinking on interference -- that it is only detrimental to the edge\nlearning system -- is outdated and we shall seek new techniques that exploit,\nrather than simply mitigate, the interference for better machine learning in\nwireless networks.",

In this contribution, we focus on\nthe uplink communications of cellular-connected UAV. To cope with the severe\ninterference among UAV-UEs, several different scheduling and power control\nalgorithms are proposed to optimize the spectrum efficiency (SE) based on the\ngeometrical programming (GP) principle together with the successive convex\napproximation (SCA) technique. The proposed schemes include maximizing the sum\nSE of UAVs, maximizing the minimum SE of UAVs, etc., applied in the frequency\ndomain and/or the time domain. Moreover, the quality of service (QoS)\nconstraint and the uplink single-carrier (SC) constraint are also considered.\nThe performances of these power and resource allocation algorithms are\nevaluated via extensive simulations in both full buffer transmission mode and\nbursty traffic mode. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithms can\neffectively enhance the uplink SEs of cellular-connected UAVs.",

    "abstract": "Although spiking neural networks (SNNs) take benefits from the bio-plausible\nneural modeling, the low accuracy under the common local synaptic plasticity\nlearning rules limits their application in many practical tasks. Recently, an\nemerging SNN supervised learning algorithm inspired by backpropagation through\ntime (BPTT) from the domain of artificial neural networks (ANNs) has\nsuccessfully boosted the accuracy of SNNs and helped improve the practicability\nof SNNs. However, current general-purpose processors suffer from low efficiency\nwhen performing BPTT for SNNs due to the ANN-tailored optimization. On the\nother hand, current neuromorphic chips cannot support BPTT because they mainly\nadopt local synaptic plasticity rules for simplified implementation.\nIn this work, we propose H2Learn, a novel architecture that can achieve high\nefficiency for BPTT-based SNN learning which ensures high accuracy of SNNs. At\nthe beginning, we characterized the behaviors of BPTT-based SNN learning.\nBenefited from the binary spike-based computation in the forward pass and the\nweight update, we first design lookup table (LUT) based processing elements in\nForward Engine and Weight Update Engine to make accumulations implicit and to\nfuse the computations of multiple input points. Second, benefited from the rich\nsparsity in the backward pass, we design a dual-sparsity-aware Backward Engine\nwhich exploits both input and output sparsity. Finally, we apply a pipeline\noptimization between different engines to build an end-to-end solution for the\nBPTT-based SNN learning. Compared with the modern NVIDIA V100 GPU, H2Learn\nachieves 7.38x area saving, 5.74-10.20x speedup, and 5.25-7.12x energy saving\non several benchmark datasets.",

    "abstract": "Uncertainties in machine learning are a significant roadblock for its\napplication in safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPS). One source of\nuncertainty arises from distribution shifts in the input data between training\nand test scenarios. Detecting such distribution shifts in real-time is an\nemerging approach to address the challenge. The high dimensional input space in\nCPS applications involving imaging adds extra difficulty to the task.\nGenerative learning models are widely adopted for the task, namely\nout-of-distribution (OoD) detection. To improve the state-of-the-art, we\nstudied existing proposals from both machine learning and CPS fields. In the\nlatter, safety monitoring in real-time for autonomous driving agents has been a\nfocus. Exploiting the spatiotemporal correlation of motion in videos, we can\nrobustly detect hazardous motion around autonomous driving agents. Inspired by\nthe latest advances in the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) theory and practice,\nwe tapped into the prior knowledge in data to further boost OoD detection's\nrobustness. Comparison studies over nuScenes and Synthia data sets show our\nmethods significantly improve detection capabilities of OoD factors unique to\ndriving scenarios, 42% better than state-of-the-art approaches. Our model also\ngeneralized near-perfectly, 97% better than the state-of-the-art across the\nreal-world and simulation driving data sets experimented. Finally, we\ncustomized one proposed method into a twin-encoder model that can be deployed\nto resource limited embedded devices for real-time OoD detection. Its execution\ntime was reduced over four times in low-precision 8-bit integer inference,\nwhile detection capability is comparable to its corresponding floating-point\nmodel.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the misinformation problem has been addressed with a\ncrowdsourcing-based approach: to assess the truthfulness of a statement,\ninstead of relying on a few experts, a crowd of non-expert is exploited. We\nstudy whether crowdsourcing is an effective and reliable method to assess\ntruthfulness during a pandemic, targeting statements related to COVID-19, thus\naddressing (mis)information that is both related to a sensitive and personal\nissue and very recent as compared to when the judgment is done. In our\nexperiments, crowd workers are asked to assess the truthfulness of statements,\nand to provide evidence for the assessments. Besides showing that the crowd is\nable to accurately judge the truthfulness of the statements, we report results\non workers behavior, agreement among workers, effect of aggregation functions,\nof scales transformations, and of workers background and bias. We perform a\nlongitudinal study by re-launching the task multiple times with both novice and\nexperienced workers, deriving important insights on how the behavior and\nquality change over time. Our results show that: workers are able to detect and\nobjectively categorize online (mis)information related to COVID-19; both\ncrowdsourced and expert judgments can be transformed and aggregated to improve\nquality; worker background and other signals (e.g., source of information,\nbehavior) impact the quality of the data.

The SEA module contains a simple fully\nconvolutional semantic segmentation branch with extra supervision to strengthen\nthe activation of interest instances on the feature map and reduce the\nbackground noise's interference. To handle the under-segmentation of geospatial\ninstances with large varying scales, we design the SCMB that extends the\noriginal single mask branch to trident mask branches and introduces\ncomplementary mask supervision at different scales to sufficiently leverage the\nmulti-scale information.

The DID problem is first\nformulated as a nonlinear program (NLP) by the Radua collocation method which\nis flexible to handle various types of disturbances and bounds constraints.\nSince the NLP of DID is highly non-convex, semi-definite programming (SDP)\nrelaxation for the NLP is further derived to tackle the non-convexity, followed\nby its sparsity being exploited hierarchically based on chordality of graphs to\nseek enhancement of computational efficiency. Considering high dimension and\ninexactness of the SDP relaxation, a feasibility-embedded distributed approach\nis finally proposed under the framework of alternating direction method of\nmultipliers (ADMM), which achieves parallel computing and solution feasibility\nregarding the original NLP.

Only relying on class activation maps (CAM) with image-level\nlabels provides deficient segmentation supervision. Prior works thus consider\npre-trained models to produce coarse saliency maps to guide the generation of\npseudo segmentation labels. However, the commonly used off-line heuristic\ngeneration process cannot fully exploit the benefits of these coarse saliency\nmaps. Motivated by the significant inter-task correlation, we propose a novel\nweakly supervised multi-task framework termed as AuxSegNet, to leverage\nsaliency detection and multi-label image classification as auxiliary tasks to\nimprove the primary task of semantic segmentation using only image-level\nground-truth labels. Inspired by their similar structured semantics, we also\npropose to learn a cross-task global pixel-level affinity map from the saliency\nand segmentation representations. The learned cross-task affinity can be used\nto refine saliency predictions and propagate CAM maps to provide improved\npseudo labels for both tasks. The mutual boost between pseudo label updating\nand cross-task affinity learning enables iterative improvements on segmentation\nperformance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed auxiliary learning network structure and the cross-task affinity\nlearning method. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art weakly\nsupervised segmentation performance on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS\nCOCO benchmarks.",

    "title": "ROD: Reception-aware Online Distillation for Sparse Graphs",
    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used in many graph-based tasks\nsuch as node classification, link prediction, and node clustering. However,\nGNNs gain their performance benefits mainly from performing the feature\npropagation and smoothing across the edges of the graph, thus requiring\nsufficient connectivity and label information for effective propagation.\nUnfortunately, many real-world networks are sparse in terms of both edges and\nlabels, leading to sub-optimal performance of GNNs. Recent interest in this\nsparse problem has focused on the self-training approach, which expands\nsupervised signals with pseudo labels. Nevertheless, the self-training approach\ninherently cannot realize the full potential of refining the learning\nperformance on sparse graphs due to the unsatisfactory quality and quantity of\npseudo labels.\nIn this paper, we propose ROD, a novel reception-aware online knowledge\ndistillation approach for sparse graph learning. We design three supervision\nsignals for ROD: multi-scale reception-aware graph knowledge, task-based\nsupervision, and rich distilled knowledge, allowing online knowledge transfer\nin a peer-teaching manner. To extract knowledge concealed in the multi-scale\nreception fields, ROD explicitly requires individual student models to preserve\ndifferent levels of locality information. For a given task, each student would\npredict based on its reception-scale knowledge, while simultaneously a strong\nteacher is established on-the-fly by combining multi-scale knowledge. Our\napproach has been extensively evaluated on 9 datasets and a variety of\ngraph-based tasks, including node classification, link prediction, and node\nclustering. The result demonstrates that ROD achieves state-of-art performance\nand is more robust for the graph sparsity.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we propose the first multi-rate\nNyquist-subcarriers modulation (SCM) for C-band 100Gbit/s signal transmission\nover 50km dispersion-uncompensated link. Chromatic dispersion (CD) introduces\nsevere spectral nulls on optical double-sideband signal, which greatly degrades\nthe performance of intensity-modulation and direct-detection systems. In the\nprevious works, high-complexity digital signal processing (DSP) is required to\nresist the CD-caused spectral nulls. Based on the characteristics of dispersive\nchannel, Nyquist-SCM with multi-rate subcarriers is proposed to keep away from\nthe CD-caused spectral nulls flexibly. Signal on each subcarrier can be\nindividually recovered by a DSP with an acceptable complexity, including the\nfeed-forward equalizer with no more than 31 taps, a two-tap post filter, and\nmaximum likelihood sequence estimation with one memory length. Combining with\nentropy loading based on probabilistic constellation shaping to maximize the\ncapacity-reach, the C-band 100Gbit/s multi-rate Nyquist-SCM signal over 50km\ndispersion-uncompensated link can achieve 7% hard-decision forward error\ncorrection limit and average normalized generalized mutual information of\n0.967.

In contrast to most other recommendation domains, which\npredominantly rely on collaborative filtering (CF) techniques, music\nrecommenders have traditionally embraced content-based (CB) approaches. In the\npast years, music recommendation models that leverage collaborative and content\ndata -- which we refer to as content-driven models -- have been replacing pure\nCF or CB models.\nIn this survey, we review 47 articles on content-driven music recommendation.\nBased on a thorough literature analysis, we first propose an onion model\ncomprising five layers, each of which corresponds to a category of music\ncontent we identified: signal, embedded metadata, expert-generated content,\nuser-generated content, and derivative content. We provide a detailed\ncharacterization of each category along several dimensions. Second, we identify\nsix overarching challenges, according to which we organize our main discussion:\nincreasing recommendation diversity and novelty, providing transparency and\nexplanations, accomplishing context-awareness, recommending sequences of music,\nimproving scalability and efficiency, and alleviating cold start. Each article\naddressing one or more of these challenges is categorized according to the\ncontent layers of our onion model, the article's goal(s), and main\nmethodological choices. Furthermore, articles are discussed in temporal order\nto shed light on the evolution of content-driven music recommendation\nstrategies.

Several approaches exist, yet at large scale we face a combinatorial\nexplosion of possible solutions and state-of-the-art methods like RANSAC, Hough\ntransform or Branch\\&Bound require a minimum inlier ratio or prior knowledge to\nremain practical. In fact, for problems such as camera posing in very large\nscenes these approaches become useless as they have exponential runtime growth\nif these conditions aren't met. To approach the problem we present a efficient\nand general algorithm for outlier rejection based on \"intersecting\"\n$k$-dimensional surfaces in $R^d$. We provide a recipe for casting a variety of\ngeometric problems as finding a point in $R^d$ which maximizes the number of\nnearby surfaces (and thus inliers). The resulting algorithm has linear\nworst-case complexity with a better runtime dependency in the approximation\nfactor than competing algorithms while not requiring domain specific bounds.\nThis is achieved by introducing a space decomposition scheme that bounds the\nnumber of computations by successively rounding and grouping samples. Our\nrecipe (and open-source code) enables anybody to derive such fast approaches to\nnew problems across a wide range of domains.

    "abstract": "How to model fine-grained spatial-temporal dynamics in videos has been a\nchallenging problem for action recognition. It requires learning deep and rich\nfeatures with superior distinctiveness for the subtle and abstract motions.\nMost existing methods generate features of a layer in a pure feedforward\nmanner, where the information moves in one direction from inputs to outputs.\nAnd they rely on stacking more layers to obtain more powerful features,\nbringing extra non-negligible overheads. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive\nRecursive Circle (ARC) framework, a fine-grained decorator for pure feedforward\nlayers. It inherits the operators and parameters of the original layer but is\nslightly different in the use of those operators and parameters. Specifically,\nthe input of the layer is treated as an evolving state, and its update is\nalternated with the feature generation. At each recursive step, the input state\nis enriched by the previously generated features and the feature generation is\nmade with the newly updated input state. We hope the ARC framework can\nfacilitate fine-grained action recognition by introducing deeply refined\nfeatures and multi-scale receptive fields at a low cost. Significant\nimprovements over feedforward baselines are observed on several benchmarks.

To\nfurther improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the transformer, there are\ntwo trains of thought among existing works: (1) going wider by scaling to more\ntrainable parameters; (2) going shallower by parameter sharing or model\ncompressing along with the depth. However, larger models usually do not scale\nwell when fewer tokens are available to train, and advanced parallelisms are\nrequired when the model is extremely large. Smaller models usually achieve\ninferior performance compared to the original transformer model due to the loss\nof representation power. In this paper, to achieve better performance with\nfewer trainable parameters, we propose a framework to deploy trainable\nparameters efficiently, by going wider instead of deeper. Specially, we scale\nalong model width by replacing feed-forward network (FFN) with\nmixture-of-experts (MoE). We then share the MoE layers across transformer\nblocks using individual layer normalization. Such deployment plays the role to\ntransform various semantic representations, which makes the model more\nparameter-efficient and effective. To evaluate our framework, we design WideNet\nand evaluate it on ImageNet-1K. Our best model outperforms Vision Transformer\n(ViT) by $1.46\\%$ with $0.72 \\times$ trainable parameters.

We posit\nthat doing so requires our community to shift, from operational aspects taken\nin isolation to holistic analysis of datacenter resources, energy, and\nworkloads. In turn, this shift will require new analysis methods, and\nopen-access, FAIR datasets with fine temporal and spatial granularity. We\nleverage in this work one of the (rare) public datasets providing fine-grained\ninformation on datacenter operations. Using it, we show strong evidence that\nfine-grained information reveals new operational aspects. We then propose a\nmethod for holistic analysis of datacenter operations, providing statistical\ncharacterization of node, energy, and workload aspects. We demonstrate the\nbenefits of our holistic analysis method by applying it to the operations of a\ndatacenter infrastructure with over 300 nodes. Our analysis reveals both\ngeneric and ML-specific aspects, and further details how the operational\nbehavior of the datacenter changed during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. We make\nover 30 main observations, providing holistic insight into the long-term\noperation of a large-scale, public scientific infrastructure. We suggest such\nobservations can help immediately with performance engineering tasks such as\npredicting future datacenter load, and also long-term with the design of\ndatacenter infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "Model-based control usually relies on an accurate model, which is often\nobtained from CAD and actuator models. The more accurate the model the better\nthe control performance. However, in bipedal robots that demonstrate high\nagility actions, such as running and hopping, the robot hardware will suffer\nfrom impacts with the environment and deform in vulnerable parts, which\ninvalidates the predefined model. Thus, it is desired to have an adaptable\nkinematic structure that takes deformation into consideration. To account for\nthis we propose an approach that models all of the robotic joints as 6-DOF\njoints and develop an algorithm that can identify the kinematic structure from\nmotion capture data. We evaluate the algorithm's performance both in simulation\n- a three link pendulum, and on a bipedal robot - ATRIAS. In the simulated case\nthe algorithm produces a result that has a 3.6% error compared to the ground\ntruth, and on the real life bipedal robot the algorithm's result confirms our\nprior assumption where the joint deforms on out-of-plane degrees of freedom. In\naddition our algorithm is able to predict torques and forces using the\nreconstructed joint mode.",

This basic construction can be extended with propositional\nquantification, resulting in an algorithm for HyperQPTL.

An attractive compromise is offered by\nMPL[E], i.e., monadic path logic extended with the equal-level predicate. The\nexpressiveness of MPL[E] falls strictly between that of HyperCTL* and\nHyperQCTL*. MPL[E] subsumes both HyperCTL* and HyperKCTL*, the extension of\nHyperCTL* with the knowledge operator.

While\nfluid democracy has been viewed as a system that can combine the best aspects\nof direct and representative democracy, it can also result in situations where\nfew voters amass a large amount of influence. To analyze the impact of this\nshortcoming, we consider what has been called an epistemic setting, where\nvoters decide on a binary issue for which there is a ground truth. Previous\nwork has shown that under certain assumptions on the delegation mechanism, the\nconcentration of power is so severe that fluid democracy is less likely to\nidentify the ground truth than direct voting. We examine different, arguably\nmore realistic, classes of mechanisms, and prove they behave well by ensuring\nthat (with high probability) there is a limit on concentration of power.

    "abstract": "Side-channel analysis, originally used in cryptanalysis is growing in use\ncases, both offensive and defensive. Wavelet analysis is a commonly employed\ntime-frequency analysis technique used across disciplines, with a variety of\npurposes, and has shown increasing prevalence within side-channel literature.\nThis paper explores wavelet selection and analysis parameters for use in\nside-channel analysis, particularly power side-channel-based instruction\ndisassembly and classification. Experiments are conducted on an ATmega328P\nmicrocontroller and a subset of the AVR instruction set. Classification\nperformance is evaluated with a time-series convolutional neural network (CNN)\nat clock-cycle fidelity. This work demonstrates that wavelet selection and\nemployment parameters have meaningful impact on analysis outcomes.\nPractitioners should make informed decisions and consider optimizing these\nfactors similarly to machine learning architecture and hyperparameters. We\nconclude that the gaus1 wavelet with scales 1-21 and grayscale colormap\nprovided the best balance of classification performance, time, and memory\nefficiency in our application.",

    "abstract": "Despite much recent progress in video-based person re-identification (re-ID),\nthe current state-of-the-art still suffers from common real-world challenges\nsuch as appearance similarity among various people, occlusions, and frame\nmisalignment. To alleviate these problems, we propose Spatio-Temporal\nRepresentation Factorization module (STRF), a flexible new computational unit\nthat can be used in conjunction with most existing 3D convolutional neural\nnetwork architectures for re-ID. The key innovations of STRF over prior work\ninclude explicit pathways for learning discriminative temporal and spatial\nfeatures, with each component further factorized to capture complementary\nperson-specific appearance and motion information. Specifically, temporal\nfactorization comprises two branches, one each for static features (e.g., the\ncolor of clothes) that do not change much over time, and dynamic features\n(e.g., walking patterns) that change over time. Further, spatial factorization\nalso comprises two branches to learn both global (coarse segments) as well as\nlocal (finer segments) appearance features, with the local features\nparticularly useful in cases of occlusion or spatial misalignment. These two\nfactorization operations taken together result in a modular architecture for\nour parameter-wise economic STRF unit that can be plugged in between any two 3D\nconvolutional layers, resulting in an end-to-end learning framework. We\nempirically show that STRF improves performance of various existing baseline\narchitectures while demonstrating new state-of-the-art results using standard\nperson re-identification evaluation protocols on three benchmarks.",

A recently\ndeveloped approach for conducting RLAs, SHANGRLA, provides a flexible framework\nthat can encompass a wide variety of social choice functions and audit\nstrategies.

To\naccomplish this goal, we conducted a systematic literature review on privacy\nenhancement in data markets for the IoT, covering $50$ publications dated up to\nJuly 2020.

    "abstract": "Road curb detection is important for autonomous driving. It can be used to\ndetermine road boundaries to constrain vehicles on roads, so that potential\naccidents could be avoided. Most of the current methods detect road curbs\nonline using vehicle-mounted sensors, such as cameras or 3-D Lidars. However,\nthese methods usually suffer from severe occlusion issues. Especially in\nhighly-dynamic traffic environments, most of the field of view is occupied by\ndynamic objects. To alleviate this issue, we detect road curbs offline using\nhigh-resolution aerial images in this paper. Moreover, the detected road curbs\ncan be used to create high-definition (HD) maps for autonomous vehicles.\nSpecifically, we first predict the pixel-wise segmentation map of road curbs,\nand then conduct a series of post-processing steps to extract the graph\nstructure of road curbs. To tackle the disconnectivity issue in the\nsegmentation maps, we propose an innovative connectivity-preserving loss\n(CP-loss) to improve the segmentation performance. The experimental results on\na public dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed loss function.\nThis paper is accompanied with a demonstration video and a supplementary\ndocument, which are available at\n\\texttt{\\url{https://sites.google.com/view/cp-loss}}.",

    "abstract": "Weighting strategy prevails in machine learning. For example, a common\napproach in robust machine learning is to exert lower weights on samples which\nare likely to be noisy or hard. This study reveals another undiscovered\nstrategy, namely, compensating, that has also been widely used in machine\nlearning. Learning with compensating is called compensation learning and a\nsystematic taxonomy is constructed for it in this study. In our taxonomy,\ncompensation learning is divided on the basis of the compensation targets,\ninference manners, and granularity levels. Many existing learning algorithms\nincluding some classical ones can be seen as a special case of compensation\nlearning or partially leveraging compensating. Furthermore, a family of new\nlearning algorithms can be obtained by plugging the compensation learning into\nexisting learning algorithms. Specifically, three concrete new learning\nalgorithms are proposed for robust machine learning. Extensive experiments on\ntext sentiment analysis, image classification, and graph classification verify\nthe effectiveness of the three new algorithms. Compensation learning can also\nbe used in various learning scenarios, such as imbalance learning, clustering,\nregression, and so on.",

    "abstract": "Blame attribution is one of the key aspects of accountable decision making,\nas it provides means to quantify the responsibility of an agent for a decision\nmaking outcome. In this paper, we study blame attribution in the context of\ncooperative multi-agent sequential decision making. As a particular setting of\ninterest, we focus on cooperative decision making formalized by Multi-Agent\nMarkov Decision Processes (MMDP), and we analyze different blame attribution\nmethods derived from or inspired by existing concepts in cooperative game\ntheory. We formalize desirable properties of blame attribution in the setting\nof interest, and we analyze the relationship between these properties and the\nstudied blame attribution methods. Interestingly, we show that some of the well\nknown blame attribution methods, such as Shapley value, are not\nperformance-incentivizing, while others, such as Banzhaf index, may over-blame\nagents. To mitigate these value misalignment and fairness issues, we introduce\na novel blame attribution method, unique in the set of properties it satisfies,\nwhich trade-offs explanatory power (by under-blaming agents) for the\naforementioned properties. We further show how to account for uncertainty about\nagents' decision making policies, and we experimentally: a) validate the\nqualitative properties of the studied blame attribution methods, and b) analyze\ntheir robustness to uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "Detecting rumors on social media is a very critical task with significant\nimplications to the economy, public health, etc. Previous works generally\ncapture effective features from texts and the propagation structure. However,\nthe uncertainty caused by unreliable relations in the propagation structure is\ncommon and inevitable due to wily rumor producers and the limited collection of\nspread data. Most approaches neglect it and may seriously limit the learning of\nfeatures. Towards this issue, this paper makes the first attempt to explore\npropagation uncertainty for rumor detection.

The model adaptively rethinks the reliability of latent\nrelations by adopting a Bayesian approach. Besides, we design a new edge-wise\nconsistency training framework to optimize the model by enforcing consistency\non relations.

Since the number of parameters increases quadratically\nwith the size of the convolution kernel, many popular models use small\nconvolution kernels, resulting in small local receptive fields in lower layers.\nThis paper proposes a novel log-polar space convolution (LPSC) method, where\nthe convolution kernel is elliptical and adaptively divides its local receptive\nfield into different regions according to the relative directions and\nlogarithmic distances.

    "abstract": "Although federated learning (FL) has recently been proposed for efficient\ndistributed training and data privacy protection, it still encounters many\nobstacles. One of these is the naturally existing statistical heterogeneity\namong clients, making local data distributions non independently and\nidentically distributed (i.e., non-iid), which poses challenges for model\naggregation and personalization. For FL with a deep neural network (DNN),\nprivatizing some layers is a simple yet effective solution for non-iid\nproblems. However, which layers should we privatize to facilitate the learning\nprocess? Do different categories of non-iid scenes have preferred privatization\nways? Can we automatically learn the most appropriate privatization way during\nFL? In this paper, we answer these questions via abundant experimental studies\non several FL benchmarks. First, we present the detailed statistics of these\nbenchmarks and categorize them into covariate and label shift non-iid scenes.\nThen, we investigate both coarse-grained and fine-grained network splits and\nexplore whether the preferred privatization ways have any potential relations\nto the specific category of a non-iid scene. Our findings are exciting, e.g.,\nprivatizing the base layers could boost the performances even in label shift\nnon-iid scenes, which are inconsistent with some natural conjectures. We also\nfind that none of these privatization ways could improve the performances on\nthe Shakespeare benchmark, and we guess that Shakespeare may not be a seriously\nnon-iid scene. Finally, we propose several approaches to automatically learn\nwhere to aggregate via cross-stitch, soft attention, and hard selection. We\nadvocate the proposed methods could serve as a preliminary try to explore where\nto privatize for a novel non-iid scene.",

    "abstract": "Price movement forecasting aims at predicting the future trends of financial\nassets based on the current market conditions and other relevant information.\nRecently, machine learning(ML) methods have become increasingly popular and\nachieved promising results for price movement forecasting in both academia and\nindustry. Most existing ML solutions formulate the forecasting problem as a\nclassification(to predict the direction) or a regression(to predict the return)\nproblem in the entire set of training data. However, due to the extremely low\nsignal-to-noise ratio and stochastic nature of financial data, good trading\nopportunities are extremely scarce. As a result, without careful selection of\npotentially profitable samples, such ML methods are prone to capture the\npatterns of noises instead of real signals. To address the above issues, we\npropose a novel framework-LARA(Locality-Aware Attention and Adaptive Refined\nLabeling), which contains the following three components: 1)Locality-aware\nattention automatically extracts the potentially profitable samples by\nattending to their label information in order to construct a more accurate\nclassifier on these selected samples. 2)Adaptive refined labeling further\niteratively refines the labels, alleviating the noise of samples. 3)Equipped\nwith metric learning techniques, Locality-aware attention enjoys task-specific\ndistance metrics and distributes attention on potentially profitable samples in\na more effective way. To validate our method, we conduct comprehensive\nexperiments on three real-world financial markets: ETFs, the China's A-share\nstock market, and the cryptocurrency market.

    "abstract": "Few-shot learning aims to train a classifier that can generalize well when\njust a small number of labeled samples per class are given. We introduce\nTransductive Maximum Margin Classifier (TMMC) for few-shot learning. The basic\nidea of the classical maximum margin classifier is to solve an optimal\nprediction function that the corresponding separating hyperplane can correctly\ndivide the training data and the resulting classifier has the largest geometric\nmargin. In few-shot learning scenarios, the training samples are scarce, not\nenough to find a separating hyperplane with good generalization ability on\nunseen data. TMMC is constructed using a mixture of the labeled support set and\nthe unlabeled query set in a given task. The unlabeled samples in the query set\ncan adjust the separating hyperplane so that the prediction function is optimal\non both the labeled and unlabeled samples. Furthermore, we leverage an\nefficient and effective quasi-Newton algorithm, the L-BFGS method to optimize\nTMMC. Experimental results on three standard few-shot learning benchmarks\nincluding miniImagenet, tieredImagenet and CUB suggest that our TMMC achieves\nstate-of-the-art accuracies.",

This motivates the task of Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning\n(CD-FSL). In this paper, we realize that the labeled target data in CD-FSL has\nnot been leveraged in any way to help the learning process. Thus, we advocate\nutilizing few labeled target data to guide the model learning. Technically, a\nnovel meta-FDMixup network is proposed. We tackle this problem mainly from two\naspects. Firstly, to utilize the source and the newly introduced target data of\ntwo different class sets, a mixup module is re-proposed and integrated into the\nmeta-learning mechanism. Secondly, a novel disentangle module together with a\ndomain classifier is proposed to extract the disentangled domain-irrelevant and\ndomain-specific features. These two modules together enable our model to narrow\nthe domain gap thus generalizing well to the target datasets. Additionally, a\ndetailed feasibility and pilot study is conducted to reflect the intuitive\nunderstanding of CD-FSL under our new setting.

However, the accurate processing\nof the spectral and spatial correlation between the bands requires the use of\nenergy-expensive 3-D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). To address this\nchallenge, we propose the use of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) that are\ngenerated from iso-architecture CNNs and trained with quantization-aware\ngradient descent to optimize their weights, membrane leak, and firing\nthresholds. During both training and inference, the analog pixel values of a\nHSI are directly applied to the input layer of the SNN without the need to\nconvert to a spike-train. The reduced latency of our training technique\ncombined with high activation sparsity yields significant improvements in\ncomputational efficiency.

The core design of ThunderRW is motivated by our\nprofiling results: common RW algorithms have as high as 73.1% CPU pipeline\nslots stalled due to irregular memory access, which suffers significantly more\nmemory stalls than the conventional graph workloads such as BFS and SSSP. To\nimprove the memory efficiency, we first design a generic step-centric\nprogramming model named Gather-Move-Update to abstract different RW algorithms.\nBased on the programming model, we develop the step interleaving technique to\nhide memory access latency by switching the executions of different random walk\nqueries. In our experiments, we use four representative RW algorithms including\nPPR, DeepWalk, Node2Vec and MetaPath to demonstrate the efficiency and\nprogramming flexibility of ThunderRW.

    "abstract": "Data augmentation is practically helpful for visual recognition, especially\nat the time of data scarcity. However, such success is only limited to quite a\nfew light augmentations (e.g., random crop, flip). Heavy augmentations (e.g.,\ngray, grid shuffle) are either unstable or show adverse effects during\ntraining, owing to the big gap between the original and augmented images. This\npaper introduces a novel network design, noted as Augmentation Pathways (AP),\nto systematically stabilize training on a much wider range of augmentation\npolicies. Notably, AP tames heavy data augmentations and stably boosts\nperformance without a careful selection among augmentation policies. Unlike\ntraditional single pathway, augmented images are processed in different neural\npaths. The main pathway handles light augmentations, while other pathways focus\non heavy augmentations. By interacting with multiple paths in a dependent\nmanner, the backbone network robustly learns from shared visual patterns among\naugmentations, and suppresses noisy patterns at the same time. Furthermore, we\nextend AP to a homogeneous version and a heterogeneous version for high-order\nscenarios, demonstrating its robustness and flexibility in practical usage.\nExperimental results on ImageNet benchmarks demonstrate the compatibility and\neffectiveness on a much wider range of augmentations (e.g., Crop, Gray, Grid\nShuffle, RandAugment), while consuming fewer parameters and lower computational\ncosts at inference time.

Therefore, algorithms to detect such attacks (Presentation Attack\nDetection (PAD)) have been increasing in relevance. The LivDet-2020 competition\nwhich focuses on Presentation Attacks Detection (PAD) algorithms have shown\nstill open problems, specially for unknown attacks scenarios. In order to\nimprove the robustness of biometric systems, it is crucial to improve PAD\nmethods. This can be achieved by augmenting the number of presentation attack\ninstruments (PAI) and bona fide images that are used to train such algorithms.\nUnfortunately, the capture and creation of presentation attack instruments and\neven the capture of bona fide images is sometimes complex to achieve.

Surprisingly, The PAD\nalgorithm was not able to detect the synthetic images as a Presentation Attack,\ncategorizing all of them as bona fide.

    "abstract": "Land cover maps are of vital importance to various fields such as land use\npolicy development, ecosystem services, urban planning and agriculture\nmonitoring, which are mainly generated from remote sensing image classification\ntechniques. Traditional land cover classification usually needs tremendous\ncomputational resources, which often becomes a huge burden to the remote\nsensing community. Undoubtedly cloud computing is one of the best choices for\nland cover classification, however, if not managed properly, the computation\ncost on the cloud could be surprisingly high. Recently, cutting the unnecessary\ncomputation long tail has become a promising solution for saving the cost in\nthe cloud. For land cover classification, it is generally not necessary to\nachieve the best accuracy and 85% can be regarded as a reliable land cover\nclassification. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a framework for\ncost-effective remote sensing classification. Given the desired accuracy, the\nclustering algorithm can stop early for cost-saving whilst achieving sufficient\naccuracy for land cover image classification. Experimental results show that\nachieving 85%-99.9% accuracy needs only 27.34%-60.83% of the total cloud\ncomputation cost for achieving a 100% accuracy. To put it into perspective, for\nthe US land cover classification example, the proposed approach can save over\n$721,580.46 for the government in each single-use when the desired accuracy is\n90%.",

    "abstract": "Adiabatic quantum-flux-parametron (AQFP) logic is an energy-efficient\nsuperconductor logic family. The latency of AQFP circuits is relatively long\ncompared to that of other superconductor logic families and thus such circuits\nrequire low-latency clocking schemes. In a previous study, we proposed a\nlow-latency clocking scheme called delay-line clocking, in which the latency\nfor each logic operation is determined by the propagation delay of the\nexcitation current, and demonstrated a simple AQFP buffer chain that adopts\ndelay-line clocking. However, it is unclear whether more complex AQFP circuits\ncan adopt delay-line clocking. In the present study, we demonstrate AQFP logic\ngates (AND and XOR gates) that use delay-line clocking as a step towards\nimplementing large-scale AQFP circuits with delay-line clocking. AND and XOR\ngates with a latency of approximately 20 ps per gate are shown to operate at up\nto 5 and 4 GHz, respectively, in experiments. We also demonstrate that\ndelay-line clocking enables phase skipping operation, in which some of the AQFP\nbuffers for phase synchronization are removed to reduce the junction count and\nenergy dissipation. The results indicate that delay-line clocking can enable\nlow-latency, low-energy, large-scale AQFP circuits.",

Though many models have been proposed such\nas FM, FFM and DeepFM in recent years, feature engineering is still a very\nimportant way to improve the model performance in many applications because\nusing raw features can rarely lead to optimal results. For example, the\ncontinuous features are usually transformed to the power forms by adding a new\nfeature to allow it to easily form non-linear functions of the feature.\nHowever, this kind of feature engineering heavily relies on peoples experience\nand it is both time consuming and labor consuming. On the other side, concise\nCTR model with both fast online serving speed and good model performance is\ncritical for many real life applications. In this paper, we propose LeafFM\nmodel based on FM to generate new features from the original feature embedding\nby learning the transformation functions automatically. We also design three\nconcrete Leaf-FM models according to the different strategies of combing the\noriginal and the generated features. Extensive experiments are conducted on\nthree real-world datasets and the results show Leaf-FM model outperforms\nstandard FMs by a large margin. Compared with FFMs, Leaf-FM can achieve\nsignificantly better performance with much less parameters. In Avazu and\nMalware dataset, add version Leaf-FM achieves comparable performance with some\ndeep learning based models such as DNN and AutoInt.

The main method of acquiring brain tumors in the clinic\nis MRI. Segmentation of brain tumor regions from multi-modal MRI scan images is\nhelpful for treatment inspection, post-diagnosis monitoring, and effect\nevaluation of patients. However, the common operation in clinical brain tumor\nsegmentation is still manual segmentation, lead to its time-consuming and large\nperformance difference between different operators, a consistent and accurate\nautomatic segmentation method is urgently needed. Methods: To meet the above\nchallenges, we propose an automatic brain tumor MRI data segmentation framework\nwhich is called AGSE-VNet. In our study, the Squeeze and Excite (SE) module is\nadded to each encoder, the Attention Guide Filter (AG) module is added to each\ndecoder, using the channel relationship to automatically enhance the useful\ninformation in the channel to suppress the useless information, and use the\nattention mechanism to guide the edge information and remove the influence of\nirrelevant information such as noise. Results: We used the BraTS2020 challenge\nonline verification tool to evaluate our approach. The focus of verification is\nthat the Dice scores of the whole tumor (WT), tumor core (TC) and enhanced\ntumor (ET) are 0.68, 0.85 and 0.70, respectively. Conclusion: Although MRI\nimages have different intensities, AGSE-VNet is not affected by the size of the\ntumor, and can more accurately extract the features of the three regions, it\nhas achieved impressive results and made outstanding contributions to the\nclinical diagnosis and treatment of brain tumor patients.",

To tackle this\nemerging challenge, we design and develop SVEva Fair, an accessible, actionable\nand model-agnostic framework for evaluating the fairness of speaker\nverification components. The framework provides evaluation measures and\nvisualisations to interrogate model performance across speaker subgroups and\ncompare fairness between models.

The proposed parent selection method considers the search frequency of\nsolutions to reduce such an adverse influence of APEAs while maintaining their\ncomputational efficiency. We conduct experiments on toy problems that reproduce\nthe evaluation time bias on multi-objective optimization problems to\ninvestigate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experiments use\nNSGA-III, a well-known multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. In the\nexperiments, we compare the proposed method with the synchronous and\nasynchronous methods. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method\ncan reduce the effect of the evaluation time bias while reducing the computing\ntime of the parallel NSGA-III.",

    "abstract": "Video-text retrieval is an important yet challenging task in vision-language\nunderstanding, which aims to learn a joint embedding space where related video\nand text instances are close to each other. Most current works simply measure\nthe video-text similarity based on video-level and text-level embeddings.\nHowever, the neglect of more fine-grained or local information causes the\nproblem of insufficient representation. Some works exploit the local details by\ndisentangling sentences, but overlook the corresponding videos, causing the\nasymmetry of video-text representation. To address the above limitations, we\npropose a Hierarchical Alignment Network (HANet) to align different level\nrepresentations for video-text matching. Specifically, we first decompose video\nand text into three semantic levels, namely event (video and text), action\n(motion and verb), and entity (appearance and noun). Based on these, we\nnaturally construct hierarchical representations in the individual-local-global\nmanner, where the individual level focuses on the alignment between frame and\nword, local level focuses on the alignment between video clip and textual\ncontext, and global level focuses on the alignment between the whole video and\ntext. Different level alignments capture fine-to-coarse correlations between\nvideo and text, as well as take the advantage of the complementary information\namong three semantic levels. Besides, our HANet is also richly interpretable by\nexplicitly learning key semantic concepts. Extensive experiments on two public\ndatasets, namely MSR-VTT and VATEX, show the proposed HANet outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art methods, which demonstrates the effectiveness of hierarchical\nrepresentation and alignment.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to automated playtesting for the\nprediction of human player behavior and experience. It has previously been\ndemonstrated that Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) game-playing agents can\npredict both game difficulty and player engagement, operationalized as average\npass and churn rates. We improve this approach by enhancing DRL with Monte\nCarlo Tree Search (MCTS). We also motivate an enhanced selection strategy for\npredictor features, based on the observation that an AI agent's best-case\nperformance can yield stronger correlations with human data than the agent's\naverage performance. Both additions consistently improve the prediction\naccuracy, and the DRL-enhanced MCTS outperforms both DRL and vanilla MCTS in\nthe hardest levels. We conclude that player modelling via automated playtesting\ncan benefit from combining DRL and MCTS. Moreover, it can be worthwhile to\ninvestigate a subset of repeated best AI agent runs, if AI gameplay does not\nyield good predictions on average.",

In this work, we develop a flexible\narchitecture for detecting anomalies in adaptive video streaming comprising\nthree main components: i) A pattern recognizer that learns a typical pattern\nfor video quality from the client-side application traces of a specific\nreference video, ii) A predictor for mapping Radio Frequency (RF) performance\nindicators collected on the network-side using user-based traces to a video\nquality measure, iii) An anomaly detector for comparing the predicted video\nquality pattern with the typical pattern to identify anomalies. We use real\nnetwork traces (i.e., on-device measurements) collected in different\ngeographical locations and at various times of day to train our machine\nlearning models. We perform extensive numerical analysis to demonstrate key\nparameters impacting correct video quality prediction and anomaly detection. In\nparticular, we have shown that the video playback time is the most crucial\nparameter determining the video quality since buffering continues during the\nplayback and resulting in better video quality further into the playback.\nHowever, we also reveal that RF performance indicators characterizing the\nquality of the cellular connectivity are required to correctly predict QoE in\nanomalous cases.

We collect data about the production and circulation of online news\nstories in France over the course of one year, adopting a multi-layer\nperspective on the media ecosystem. We source our data from websites, Twitter\nand Facebook. We also identify a certain number of important structural\nfeatures. A stochastic block model of the hyperlinks structure shows the\nsystematic rejection of counter-informational press in a separate cluster which\nhardly receives any attention from the mainstream media. Counter-informational\nsub-spaces are also peripheral on the consumption side. We measure their\nrespective audiences on Twitter and Facebook and do not observe a large\ndiscrepancy between both social networks, with counter-information space, far\nright and far left media gathering limited audiences. Finally, we also measure\nthe ideological distribution of news stories using Twitter data, which also\nsuggests that the French media landscape is quite balanced. We therefore\nconclude that the French media ecosystem does not suffer from the same level of\npolarization as the US media ecosystem. The comparison with the American\nsituation also allows us to consolidate a result from studies on\ndisinformation: the polarization of the journalistic space and the circulation\nof fake news are phenomena that only become more widespread when dominant and\ninfluential actors in the political or journalistic space spread topics and\ndubious content originally circulating in the fringe of the information space.",

In this work, we explore the robustness of visual object\ntrackers against motion blur from a new angle, i.e., adversarial blur attack\n(ABA). Our main objective is to online transfer input frames to their natural\nmotion-blurred counterparts while misleading the state-of-the-art trackers\nduring the tracking process. To this end, we first design the motion blur\nsynthesizing method for visual tracking based on the generation principle of\nmotion blur, considering the motion information and the light accumulation\nprocess. With this synthetic method, we propose \\textit{optimization-based ABA\n(OP-ABA)} by iteratively optimizing an adversarial objective function against\nthe tracking w.r.t. the motion and light accumulation parameters. The OP-ABA is\nable to produce natural adversarial examples but the iteration can cause heavy\ntime cost, making it unsuitable for attacking real-time trackers. To alleviate\nthis issue, we further propose \\textit{one-step ABA (OS-ABA)} where we design\nand train a joint adversarial motion and accumulation predictive network\n(JAMANet) with the guidance of OP-ABA, which is able to efficiently estimate\nthe adversarial motion and accumulation parameters in a one-step way.

    "abstract": "Although text recognition has significantly evolved over the years,\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models still struggle in the wild scenarios due to\ncomplex backgrounds, varying fonts, uncontrolled illuminations, distortions and\nother artefacts. This is because such models solely depend on visual\ninformation for text recognition, thus lacking semantic reasoning capabilities.\nIn this paper, we argue that semantic information offers a complementary role\nin addition to visual only. More specifically, we additionally utilize semantic\ninformation by proposing a multi-stage multi-scale attentional decoder that\nperforms joint visual-semantic reasoning. Our novelty lies in the intuition\nthat for text recognition, the prediction should be refined in a stage-wise\nmanner. Therefore our key contribution is in designing a stage-wise unrolling\nattentional decoder where non-differentiability, invoked by discretely\npredicted character labels, needs to be bypassed for end-to-end training. While\nthe first stage predicts using visual features, subsequent stages refine on top\nof it using joint visual-semantic information. Additionally, we introduce\nmulti-scale 2D attention along with dense and residual connections between\ndifferent stages to deal with varying scales of character sizes, for better\nperformance and faster convergence during training.

    "title": "A Multiple-Instance Learning Approach for the Assessment of Gallbladder  Vascularity from Laparoscopic Images",
    "abstract": "An important task at the onset of a laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC)\noperation is the inspection of gallbladder (GB) to evaluate the thickness of\nits wall, presence of inflammation and extent of fat. Difficulty in\nvisualization of the GB wall vessels may be due to the previous factors,\npotentially as a result of chronic inflammation or other diseases. In this\npaper we propose a multiple-instance learning (MIL) technique for assessment of\nthe GB wall vascularity via computer-vision analysis of images from LC\noperations. The bags correspond to a labeled (low vs. high) vascularity dataset\nof 181 GB images, from 53 operations. The instances correspond to unlabeled\npatches extracted from these images. Each patch is represented by a vector with\ncolor, texture and statistical features. We compare various state-of-the-art\nMIL and single-instance learning approaches, as well as a proposed MIL\ntechnique based on variational Bayesian inference. The methods were compared\nfor two experimental tasks: image-based and video-based (i.e. patient-based)\nclassification. The proposed approach presents the best performance with\naccuracy 92.1% and 90.3% for the first and second task, respectively. A\nsignificant advantage of the proposed technique is that it does not require the\ntime-consuming task of manual labelling the instances.",

    "abstract": "Reasoning about potential occlusions is essential for robots to efficiently\npredict whether an object exists in an environment. Though existing work shows\nthat a robot with active perception can achieve various tasks, it is still\nunclear if occlusion reasoning can be achieved. To answer this question, we\nintroduce the task of robotic object existence prediction: when being asked\nabout an object, a robot needs to move as few steps as possible around a table\nwith randomly placed objects to predict whether the queried object exists. To\naddress this problem, we propose a novel recurrent neural network model that\ncan be jointly trained with supervised and reinforcement learning methods using\na curriculum training strategy. Experimental results show that 1) both active\nperception and occlusion reasoning are necessary to successfully achieve the\ntask; 2) the proposed model demonstrates a good occlusion reasoning ability by\nachieving a similar prediction accuracy to an exhaustive exploration baseline\nwhile requiring only about $10\\%$ of the baseline's number of movement steps on\naverage; and 3) the model generalizes to novel object combinations with a\nmoderate loss of accuracy.",

Such dataset characteristics are usually treated as dataset\nbias, which damages the robustness and generalization performance of these\nrecognition systems. In this work, we scrutinize this problem from the\nperspective of causal inference, where such dataset characteristic is termed as\na confounder which misleads the system to learn the spurious correlation. To\nalleviate the negative effects brought by the dataset bias, we propose a novel\nInterventional Emotion Recognition Network (IERN) to achieve the backdoor\nadjustment, which is one fundamental deconfounding technique in causal\ninference.

    "abstract": "Networks are frequently used to model complex systems comprised of\ninteracting elements. While links capture the topology of direct interactions,\nthe true complexity of many systems originates from higher-order patterns in\npaths by which nodes can indirectly influence each other. Path data,\nrepresenting ordered sequences of consecutive direct interactions, can be used\nto model these patterns. However, to avoid overfitting, such models should only\nconsider those higher-order patterns for which the data provide sufficient\nstatistical evidence. On the other hand, we hypothesise that network models,\nwhich capture only direct interactions, underfit higher-order patterns present\nin data. Consequently, both approaches are likely to misidentify influential\nnodes in complex networks. We contribute to this issue by proposing eight\ncentrality measures based on MOGen, a multi-order generative model that\naccounts for all paths up to a maximum distance but disregards paths at higher\ndistances. We compare MOGen-based centralities to equivalent measures for\nnetwork models and path data in a prediction experiment where we aim to\nidentify influential nodes in out-of-sample data. Our results show strong\nevidence supporting our hypothesis. MOGen consistently outperforms both the\nnetwork model and path-based prediction. We further show that the performance\ndifference between MOGen and the path-based approach disappears if we have\nsufficient observations, confirming that the error is due to overfitting.",

In this part we explain the role of\nfunctional programming paradigm in the management of complex software systems,\nand how the functional programming concepts play important role in the\ndesigning such systems. Key prerequisite for implementing functional\nprogramming concepts is properly designed system structure following well\ndefined design principles and rules.

Furthermore, we also explain\nhow new emerging technologies are designed in such a way that they enforce the\ndevelopment of systems that comply to the design rules inspired by the\nfunctional programming. This is extremely important in view of the current\nnetwork evolution and virtualization concepts, which will require many\nfunctional programming concepts in the network services and functions, as will\nbe discussed in part II of these lecture notes. These notes provide an\nintroduction to the subject, with the goal of explaining the problems and the\nprinciples, methods and techniques used for their solution.

First, it should allow precise and targeted\nediting of individual facial actions. Second, it should generate high fidelity\noutputs without artifacts. We build a solution based on StyleGAN, which has\nbeen used extensively for semantic manipulation of faces. As we do so, we add\nto our understanding of how various semantic attributes are encoded in\nStyleGAN. In particular, we show that a naive strategy to perform editing in\nthe latent space results in undesired coupling between certain action units,\neven if they are conceptually distinct. For example, although brow lowerer and\nlip tightener are distinct action units, they appear correlated in the training\ndata. Hence, StyleGAN has difficulty in disentangling them.

First, most existing\nPINNs are based on point-wise formulation with fully-connected networks to\nlearn continuous functions, which suffer from poor scalability and hard\nboundary enforcement. Second, the infinite search space over-complicates the\nnon-convex optimization for network training. Third, although the convolutional\nneural network (CNN)-based discrete learning can significantly improve training\nefficiency, CNNs struggle to handle irregular geometries with unstructured\nmeshes. To properly address these challenges, we present a novel discrete PINN\nframework based on graph convolutional network (GCN) and variational structure\nof PDE to solve forward and inverse partial differential equations (PDEs) in a\nunified manner. The use of a piecewise polynomial basis can reduce the\ndimension of search space and facilitate training and convergence. Without the\nneed of tuning penalty parameters in classic PINNs, the proposed method can\nstrictly impose boundary conditions and assimilate sparse data in both forward\nand inverse settings.

As evident from our results, we overcome the\nmodality specific limitations, to a large extent, by the addition of other\nmodalities. This work highlights the importance of multimodal sensing,\nespecially when moving towards natural user interaction. Furthermore, our user\nbased analysis shows noteworthy differences in recognition of user behavior\ndepending upon the vehicle pose.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in linguistic steganalysis have successively applied CNNs,\nRNNs, GNNs and other deep learning models for detecting secret information in\ngenerative texts. These methods tend to seek stronger feature extractors to\nachieve higher steganalysis effects. However, we have found through experiments\nthat there actually exists significant difference between automatically\ngenerated steganographic texts and carrier texts in terms of the conditional\nprobability distribution of individual words. Such kind of statistical\ndifference can be naturally captured by the language model used for generating\nsteganographic texts, which drives us to give the classifier a priori knowledge\nof the language model to enhance the steganalysis ability. To this end, we\npresent two methods to efficient linguistic steganalysis in this paper. One is\nto pre-train a language model based on RNN, and the other is to pre-train a\nsequence autoencoder. Experimental results show that the two methods have\ndifferent degrees of performance improvement when compared to the randomly\ninitialized RNN classifier, and the convergence speed is significantly\naccelerated. Moreover, our methods have achieved the best detection results.",

    "abstract": "An over-the-air membership inference attack (MIA) is presented to leak\nprivate information from a wireless signal classifier. Machine learning (ML)\nprovides powerful means to classify wireless signals, e.g., for PHY-layer\nauthentication. As an adversarial machine learning attack, the MIA infers\nwhether a signal of interest has been used in the training data of a target\nclassifier. This private information incorporates waveform, channel, and device\ncharacteristics, and if leaked, can be exploited by an adversary to identify\nvulnerabilities of the underlying ML model (e.g., to infiltrate the PHY-layer\nauthentication). One challenge for the over-the-air MIA is that the received\nsignals and consequently the RF fingerprints at the adversary and the intended\nreceiver differ due to the discrepancy in channel conditions. Therefore, the\nadversary first builds a surrogate classifier by observing the spectrum and\nthen launches the black-box MIA on this classifier. The MIA results show that\nthe adversary can reliably infer signals (and potentially the radio and channel\ninformation) used to build the target classifier. Therefore, a proactive\ndefense is developed against the MIA by building a shadow MIA model and fooling\nthe adversary. This defense can successfully reduce the MIA accuracy and\nprevent information leakage from the wireless signal classifier.",

    "abstract": "The performance of spectral clustering heavily relies on the quality of\naffinity matrix. A variety of affinity-matrix-construction methods have been\nproposed but they have hyper-parameters to determine beforehand, which requires\nstrong experience and lead to difficulty in real applications especially when\nthe inter-cluster similarity is high or/and the dataset is large. On the other\nhand, we often have to determine to use a linear model or a nonlinear model,\nwhich still depends on experience. To solve these two problems, in this paper,\nwe present an eigen-gap guided search method for subspace clustering. The main\nidea is to find the most reliable affinity matrix among a set of candidates\nconstructed by linear and kernel regressions, where the reliability is\nquantified by the \\textit{relative-eigen-gap} of graph Laplacian defined in\nthis paper. We show, theoretically and numerically, that the Laplacian matrix\nwith a larger relative-eigen-gap often yields a higher clustering accuracy and\nstability. Our method is able to automatically search the best model and\nhyper-parameters in a pre-defined space. The search space is very easy to\ndetermine and can be arbitrarily large, though a relatively compact search\nspace can reduce the highly unnecessary computation. Our method has high\nflexibility and convenience in real applications, and also has low\ncomputational cost because the affinity matrix is not computed by iterative\noptimization. We extend the method to large-scale datasets such as MNIST, on\nwhich the time cost is less than 90s and the clustering accuracy is\nstate-of-the-art. Extensive experiments of natural image clustering show that\nour method is more stable, accurate, and efficient than baseline methods.",

Design an automatic pest recognition system is necessary\nbecause manual recognition is slow, time-consuming, and expensive. The\nImage-based pest classifier using the traditional computer vision method is not\nefficient due to the complexity. Insect pest classification is a difficult task\nbecause of various kinds, scales, shapes, complex backgrounds in the field, and\nhigh appearance similarity among insect species. With the rapid development of\ndeep learning technology, the CNN-based method is the best way to develop a\nfast and accurate insect pest classifier.

Existing diversity tests of samples from GANs are usually\nconducted qualitatively on a small scale, and/or depends on the access to\noriginal training data as well as the trained model parameters. This paper\nexplores to diagnose GAN intra-mode collapse and calibrate that, in a novel\nblack-box setting: no access to training data, nor the trained model\nparameters, is assumed.

In this work we\nintroduce a novel decomposition theorem for the convergence of FL, allowing to\nclearly quantify the impact of client sampling on the global model update.\nContrarily to previous convergence analyses, our theorem provides the exact\ndecomposition of a given convergence step, thus enabling accurate\nconsiderations about the role of client sampling and heterogeneity. First, we\nprovide a theoretical ground for previously reported results on the\nrelationship between FL convergence and the variance of the aggregation\nweights. Second, we prove for the first time that the quality of FL convergence\nis also impacted by the resulting covariance between aggregation weights.\nThird, we establish that the sum of the aggregation weights is another source\nof slow-down and should be equal to 1 to improve FL convergence speed. Our\ntheory is general, and is here applied to Multinomial Distribution (MD) and\nUniform sampling, the two default client sampling in FL, and demonstrated\nthrough a series of experiments in non-iid and unbalanced scenarios. Our\nresults suggest that MD sampling should be used as default sampling scheme, due\nto the resilience to the changes in data ratio during the learning process,\nwhile Uniform sampling is superior only in the special case when clients have\nthe same amount of data.",

Our proposed span-level approach explicitly\nconsiders the interaction between the whole spans of targets and opinions when\npredicting their sentiment relation. Thus, it can make predictions with the\nsemantics of whole spans, ensuring better sentiment consistency. To ease the\nhigh computational cost caused by span enumeration, we propose a dual-channel\nspan pruning strategy by incorporating supervision from the Aspect Term\nExtraction (ATE) and Opinion Term Extraction (OTE) tasks. This strategy not\nonly improves computational efficiency but also distinguishes the opinion and\ntarget spans more properly.

    "abstract": "Policy gradient methods are appealing in deep reinforcement learning but\nsuffer from high variance of gradient estimate. To reduce the variance, the\nstate value function is applied commonly. However, the effect of the state\nvalue function becomes limited in stochastic dynamic environments, where the\nunexpected state dynamics and rewards will increase the variance. In this\npaper, we propose to replace the state value function with a novel hindsight\nvalue function, which leverages the information from the future to reduce the\nvariance of the gradient estimate for stochastic dynamic environments.\nParticularly, to obtain an ideally unbiased gradient estimate, we propose an\ninformation-theoretic approach, which optimizes the embeddings of the future to\nbe independent of previous actions. In our experiments, we apply the proposed\nhindsight value function in stochastic dynamic environments, including\ndiscrete-action environments and continuous-action environments. Compared with\nthe standard state value function, the proposed hindsight value function\nconsistently reduces the variance, stabilizes the training, and improves the\neventual policy.",

    "title": "Effective Capacity Analysis of HARQ-enabled D2D Communication in  Multi-Tier Cellular Networks",
    "abstract": "This work does the statistical quality-of-service (QoS) analysis of a\nblock-fading device-to-device (D2D) link in a multi-tier cellular network that\nconsists of a macro-BS (BSMC) and a micro-BS (BSmC) which both operate in\nfull-duplex (FD) mode. For the D2D link under consideration, we first formulate\nthe mode selection problem-whereby D2D pair could either communicate directly,\nor, through the BSmC, or, through the BSMC-as a ternary hypothesis testing\nproblem. Next, to compute the effective capacity (EC) for the given D2D link,\nwe assume that the channel state information (CSI) is not available at the\ntransmit D2D node, and hence, it transmits at a fixed rate r with a fixed\npower. This allows us to model the D2D link as a Markov system with six-states.\nWe consider both overlay and underlay modes for the D2D link. Moreover, to\nimprove the throughput of the D2D link, we assume that the D2D pair utilizes\ntwo special automatic repeat request (ARQ) schemes, i.e., Hybrid-ARQ (HARQ) and\ntruncated HARQ. Furthermore, we consider two distinct queue models at the\ntransmit D2D node, based upon how it responds to the decoding failure at the\nreceive D2D node. Eventually, we provide closed-form expressions for the EC for\nboth HARQ-enabled D2D link and truncated HARQ-enabled D2D link, under both\nqueue models. Noting that the EC looks like a quasi-concave function of r, we\nfurther maximize the EC by searching for an optimal rate via the\ngradient-descent method. Simulation results provide us the following insights:\ni) EC decreases with an increase in the QoS exponent, ii) EC of the D2D link\nimproves when HARQ is employed, iii) EC increases with an increase in the\nquality of self-interference cancellation techniques used at BSmC and BSMC in\nFD mode.",

    "abstract": "When humans solve complex problems, they rarely come up with a decision\nright-away. Instead, they start with an intuitive decision, reflect upon it,\nspot mistakes, resolve contradictions and jump between different hypotheses.\nThus, they create a sequence of ideas and follow a train of thought that\nultimately reaches a conclusive decision. Contrary to this, today's neural\nclassification models are mostly trained to map an input to one single and\nfixed output. In this paper, we investigate how we can give models the\nopportunity of a second, third and $k$-th thought. We take inspiration from\nHegel's dialectics and propose a method that turns an existing classifier's\nclass prediction (such as the image class forest) into a sequence of\npredictions (such as forest $\\rightarrow$ tree $\\rightarrow$ mushroom).\nConcretely, we propose a correction module that is trained to estimate the\nmodel's correctness as well as an iterative prediction update based on the\nprediction's gradient. Our approach results in a dynamic system over class\nprobability distributions $\\unicode{x2014}$ the thought flow. We evaluate our\nmethod on diverse datasets and tasks from computer vision and natural language\nprocessing. We observe surprisingly complex but intuitive behavior and\ndemonstrate that our method (i) can correct misclassifications, (ii)\nstrengthens model performance, (iii) is robust to high levels of adversarial\nattacks, (iv) can increase accuracy up to 4% in a label-distribution-shift\nsetting and (iv) provides a tool for model interpretability that uncovers model\nknowledge which otherwise remains invisible in a single distribution\nprediction.",

As such, discrepancies are\nlikely to be encountered within any given system and between different systems.\nIn this study, we set to examine both types of discrepancies in the two most\nwidely used indexing systems - Web Of Science and Scopus. We use known distance\nmeasures, as well as logical set theory to examine and compare the category\nschemes defined by these systems. Our results demonstrate significant\ndiscrepancies within each system where a higher number of classified categories\ncorrelates with increased range and variance of rankings within them, and where\nredundant categories are found. Our results also show significant discrepancies\nbetween the two system.

    "abstract": "We propose a decentralised \"local2global\" approach to graph representation\nlearning, that one can a-priori use to scale any embedding technique. Our\nlocal2global approach proceeds by first dividing the input graph into\noverlapping subgraphs (or \"patches\") and training local representations for\neach patch independently. In a second step, we combine the local\nrepresentations into a globally consistent representation by estimating the set\nof rigid motions that best align the local representations using information\nfrom the patch overlaps, via group synchronization. A key distinguishing\nfeature of local2global relative to existing work is that patches are trained\nindependently without the need for the often costly parameter synchronisation\nduring distributed training. This allows local2global to scale to large-scale\nindustrial applications, where the input graph may not even fit into memory and\nmay be stored in a distributed manner. Preliminary results on medium-scale data\nsets (up to $\\sim$7K nodes and $\\sim$200K edges) are promising, with a graph\nreconstruction performance for local2global that is comparable to that of\nglobally trained embeddings. A thorough evaluation of local2global on large\nscale data and applications to downstream tasks, such as node classification\nand link prediction, constitutes ongoing work.",

    "abstract": "Distributed quantum applications impose requirements on the quality of the\nquantum states that they consume. When analyzing architecture implementations\nof quantum hardware, characterizing this quality forms an important factor in\nunderstanding their performance. Fundamental characteristics of quantum\nhardware lead to inherent tradeoffs between the quality of states and\ntraditional performance metrics such as throughput. Furthermore, any real-world\nimplementation of quantum hardware exhibits time-dependent noise that degrades\nthe quality of quantum states over time. Here, we study the performance of two\npossible architectures for interfacing a quantum processor with a quantum\nnetwork. The first corresponds to the current experimental state of the art in\nwhich the same device functions both as a processor and a network device. The\nsecond corresponds to a future architecture that separates these two functions\nover two distinct devices. We model these architectures as Markov chains and\ncompare their quality of executing quantum operations and producing entangled\nquantum states as functions of their memory lifetimes, as well as the time that\nit takes to perform various operations within each architecture. As an\nillustrative example, we apply our analysis to architectures based on\nNitrogen-Vacancy centers in diamond, where we find that for present-day device\nparameters one architecture is more suited to computation-heavy applications,\nand the other for network-heavy ones. Besides the detailed study of these\narchitectures, a novel contribution of our work are several formulas that\nconnect an understanding of waiting time distributions to the decay of quantum\nquality over time for the most common noise models employed in quantum\ntechnologies.

And at the end of the course,\n72% of the 210 students completed the course. Additionally, students'\nassignment submissions and self-reports showed an understanding of the\nprogramming concepts, with comparable performance between males and females and\nacross educational levels. Also, students mentioned that the lesson notes were\neasy to understand and they enjoyed the experience of writing code on their\nsmartphones. Moreover, students adequately received help from peers and\nfacilitators in the course forum. Lastly, results of a survey sent to students\na year after completing this program showed that they had developed various\napplications, wrote online tutorials, and learned several tools and\ntechnologies. We were successful at introducing coding skills to Africans using\nsmartphones through SuaCode Africa.",

    "abstract": "Meta-learning has emerged as a trending technique to tackle few-shot text\nclassification and achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, existing\nsolutions heavily rely on the exploitation of lexical features and their\ndistributional signatures on training data, while neglecting to strengthen the\nmodel's ability to adapt to new tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmeta-learning framework integrated with an adversarial domain adaptation\nnetwork, aiming to improve the adaptive ability of the model and generate\nhigh-quality text embedding for new classes. Extensive experiments are\nconducted on four benchmark datasets and our method demonstrates clear\nsuperiority over the state-of-the-art models in all the datasets. In\nparticular, the accuracy of 1-shot and 5-shot classification on the dataset of\n20 Newsgroups is boosted from 52.1% to 59.6%, and from 68.3% to 77.8%,\nrespectively.",

    "abstract": "Past work on optimizing fabrication plans given a carpentry design can\nprovide Pareto-optimal plans trading off between material waste, fabrication\ntime, precision, and other considerations. However, when developing fabrication\nplans, experts rarely restrict to a single design, instead considering families\nof design variations, sometimes adjusting designs to simplify fabrication.\nJointly exploring the design and fabrication plan spaces for each design is\nintractable using current techniques. We present a new approach to jointly\noptimize design and fabrication plans for carpentered objects. To make this\nbi-level optimization tractable, we adapt recent work from program synthesis\nbased on equality graphs (e-graphs), which encode sets of equivalent programs.\nOur insight is that subproblems within our bi-level problem share significant\nsubstructures. By representing both designs and fabrication plans in a new bag\nof parts(BOP) e-graph, we amortize the cost of optimizing design components\nshared among multiple candidates. Even using BOP e-graphs, the optimization\nspace grows quickly in practice. Hence, we also show how a feedback-guided\nsearch strategy dubbed Iterative Contraction and Expansion on E-graphs(ICEE)\ncan keep the size of the e-graph manage-able and direct the search toward\npromising candidates. We illustrate the advantages of our pipeline through\nexamples from the carpentry domain.",

    "abstract": "Our work is motivated by the challenges presented in preparing arrays of\natoms for use in quantum simulation. The recently-developed process of loading\natoms into traps results in approximately half of the traps being filled. To\nconsolidate the atoms so that they form a dense and regular arrangement, such\nas all locations in a grid, atoms are rearranged using moving optical tweezers.\nTime is of the essence, as the longer that the process takes and the more that\natoms are moved, the higher the chance that atoms will be lost in the process.\nViewed as a problem on graphs, we wish to solve the problem of reconfiguring\none arrangement of tokens (representing atoms) to another using as few moves as\npossible. Because the problem is NP-complete on general graphs as well as on\ngrids, we focus on the parameterized complexity for various parameters,\nconsidering both undirected and directed graphs, and tokens with and without\nlabels. For unlabelled tokens, the problem is in FPT when parameterizing by the\nnumber of tokens, the number of moves, or the number of moves plus the number\nof vertices without tokens in either the source or target configuration, but\nintractable when parameterizing by the difference between the number of moves\nand the number of differences in the placement of tokens in the source and\ntarget configurations. When labels are added to tokens, however, most of the\ntractability results are replaced by hardness results.",

Such information can be particularly useful\nin developing regions where alternative data sources may be scarce. In this\nwork, we describe a model training pipeline for detecting buildings across the\nentire continent of Africa, using 50 cm satellite imagery. Starting with the\nU-Net model, widely used in satellite image analysis, we study variations in\narchitecture, loss functions, regularization, pre-training, self-training and\npost-processing that increase instance segmentation performance. Experiments\nwere carried out using a dataset of 100k satellite images across Africa\ncontaining 1.75M manually labelled building instances, and further datasets for\npre-training and self-training.

    "abstract": "Transformer with self-attention has led to the revolutionizing of natural\nlanguage processing field, and recently inspires the emergence of\nTransformer-style architecture design with competitive results in numerous\ncomputer vision tasks. Nevertheless, most of existing designs directly employ\nself-attention over a 2D feature map to obtain the attention matrix based on\npairs of isolated queries and keys at each spatial location, but leave the rich\ncontexts among neighbor keys under-exploited. In this work, we design a novel\nTransformer-style module, i.e., Contextual Transformer (CoT) block, for visual\nrecognition. Such design fully capitalizes on the contextual information among\ninput keys to guide the learning of dynamic attention matrix and thus\nstrengthens the capacity of visual representation. Technically, CoT block first\ncontextually encodes input keys via a $3\\times3$ convolution, leading to a\nstatic contextual representation of inputs. We further concatenate the encoded\nkeys with input queries to learn the dynamic multi-head attention matrix\nthrough two consecutive $1\\times1$ convolutions. The learnt attention matrix is\nmultiplied by input values to achieve the dynamic contextual representation of\ninputs. The fusion of the static and dynamic contextual representations are\nfinally taken as outputs. Our CoT block is appealing in the view that it can\nreadily replace each $3\\times3$ convolution in ResNet architectures, yielding a\nTransformer-style backbone named as Contextual Transformer Networks (CoTNet).\nThrough extensive experiments over a wide range of applications (e.g., image\nrecognition, object detection and instance segmentation), we validate the\nsuperiority of CoTNet as a stronger backbone.

The field has attracted considerable interest and a diverse set of\nmethods have been presented for overcoming this challenge. Learning without\nForgetting (LwF) is one of the earliest and most frequently cited methods. It\nhas the advantages of not requiring the storage of samples from the previous\ntasks, of implementation simplicity, and of being well-grounded by relying on\nknowledge distillation. However, the prevailing view is that while it shows a\nrelatively small amount of forgetting when only two tasks are introduced, it\nfails to scale to long sequences of tasks. This paper challenges this view, by\nshowing that using the right architecture along with a standard set of\naugmentations, the results obtained by LwF surpass the latest algorithms for\ntask incremental scenario. This improved performance is demonstrated by an\nextensive set of experiments over CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet, where it is also\nshown that other methods cannot benefit as much from similar improvements.",

Intuitively, each user has to do some implicit\nactions (e.g., click) before making an explicit decision (e.g., purchase).\nPrevious studies showed that implicit and explicit feedback have different\nroles for a useful recommendation. However, these studies either exploit\nimplicit and explicit behaviour separately or ignore the semantic of sequential\ninteractions between users and items. In addition, we go from the hypothesis\nthat a user's preference at a time is a combination of long-term and short-term\ninterests. In this paper, we propose some Deep Learning architectures. The\nfirst one is Implicit to Explicit (ITE), to exploit users' interests through\nthe sequence of their actions. And two versions of ITE with Bidirectional\nEncoder Representations from Transformers based (BERT-based) architecture\ncalled BERT-ITE and BERT-ITE-Si, which combine users' long- and short-term\npreferences without and with side information to enhance user representation.\nThe experimental results show that our models outperform previous\nstate-of-the-art ones and also demonstrate our views on the effectiveness of\nexploiting the implicit to explicit order as well as combining long- and\nshort-term preferences in two large-scale datasets.",

    "abstract": "The time-to-market pressure and continuous growing complexity of hardware\ndesigns have promoted the globalization of the Integrated Circuit (IC) supply\nchain. However, such globalization also poses various security threats in each\nphase of the IC supply chain. Although the advancements of Machine Learning\n(ML) have pushed the frontier of hardware security, most conventional ML-based\nmethods can only achieve the desired performance by manually finding a robust\nfeature representation for circuits that are non-Euclidean data. As a result,\nmodeling these circuits using graph learning to improve design flows has\nattracted research attention in the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) field.\nHowever, due to the lack of supporting tools, only a few existing works apply\ngraph learning to resolve hardware security issues. To attract more attention,\nwe propose HW2VEC, an open-source graph learning tool that lowers the threshold\nfor newcomers to research hardware security applications with graphs. HW2VEC\nprovides an automated pipeline for extracting a graph representation from a\nhardware design in various abstraction levels (register transfer level or\ngate-level netlist). Besides, HW2VEC users can automatically transform the\nnon-Euclidean hardware designs into Euclidean graph embeddings for solving\ntheir problems. In this paper, we demonstrate that HW2VEC can achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance on two hardware security-related tasks: Hardware\nTrojan Detection and Intellectual Property Piracy Detection. We provide the\ntime profiling results for the graph extraction and the learning pipelines in\nHW2VEC.",

Their success can\nlargely be attributed to data augmentation pipelines which generate multiple\nviews of a single input that preserve the underlying semantics. In this work,\nwe introduce augmentation-augmented variational autoencoders (AAVAE), a third\napproach to self-supervised learning based on autoencoding. We derive AAVAE\nstarting from the conventional variational autoencoder (VAE), by replacing the\nKL divergence regularization, which is agnostic to the input domain, with data\naugmentations that explicitly encourage the internal representations to encode\ndomain-specific invariances and equivariances. We empirically evaluate the\nproposed AAVAE on image classification, similar to how recent contrastive and\nnon-contrastive learning algorithms have been evaluated. Our experiments\nconfirm the effectiveness of data augmentation as a replacement for KL\ndivergence regularization. The AAVAE outperforms the VAE by 30% on CIFAR-10 and\n40% on STL-10. The results for AAVAE are largely comparable to the\nstate-of-the-art for self-supervised learning.",

    "abstract": "In modern relational machine learning it is common to encounter large graphs\nthat arise via interactions or similarities between observations in many\ndomains. Further, in many cases the target entities for analysis are actually\nsignals on such graphs. We propose to compare and organize such datasets of\ngraph signals by using an earth mover's distance (EMD) with a geodesic cost\nover the underlying graph. Typically, EMD is computed by optimizing over the\ncost of transporting one probability distribution to another over an underlying\nmetric space. However, this is inefficient when computing the EMD between many\nsignals. Here, we propose an unbalanced graph earth mover's distance that\nefficiently embeds the unbalanced EMD on an underlying graph into an $L^1$\nspace, whose metric we call unbalanced diffusion earth mover's distance\n(UDEMD). This leads us to an efficient nearest neighbors kernel over many\nsignals defined on a large graph. Next, we show how this gives distances\nbetween graph signals that are robust to noise. Finally, we apply this to\norganizing patients based on clinical notes who are modelled as signals on the\nSNOMED-CT medical knowledge graph, embedding lymphoblast cells modeled as\nsignals on a gene graph, and organizing genes modeled as signals over a large\nperipheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) cell graph. In each case, we show that\nUDEMD-based embeddings find accurate distances that are highly efficient\ncompared to other methods.",

    "abstract": "Privacy concerns in client-server machine learning have given rise to private\ninference (PI), where neural inference occurs directly on encrypted inputs. PI\nprotects clients' personal data and the server's intellectual property. A\ncommon practice in PI is to use garbled circuits to compute nonlinear functions\nprivately, namely ReLUs. However, garbled circuits suffer from high storage,\nbandwidth, and latency costs. To mitigate these issues, PI-friendly polynomial\nactivation functions have been employed to replace ReLU. In this work, we ask:\nIs it feasible to substitute all ReLUs with low-degree polynomial activation\nfunctions for building deep, privacy-friendly neural networks? We explore this\nquestion by analyzing the challenges of substituting ReLUs with polynomials,\nstarting with simple drop-and-replace solutions to novel, more involved\nreplace-and-retrain strategies. We examine the limitations of each method and\nprovide commentary on the use of polynomial activation functions for PI.

    "abstract": "Voice conversion (VC) consists of digitally altering the voice of an\nindividual to manipulate part of its content, primarily its identity, while\nmaintaining the rest unchanged. Research in neural VC has accomplished\nconsiderable breakthroughs with the capacity to falsify a voice identity using\na small amount of data with a highly realistic rendering. This paper goes\nbeyond voice identity and presents a neural architecture that allows the\nmanipulation of voice attributes (e.g., gender and age). Leveraging the latest\nadvances on adversarial learning of structured speech representation, a novel\nstructured neural network is proposed in which multiple auto-encoders are used\nto encode speech as a set of idealistically independent linguistic and\nextra-linguistic representations, which are learned adversariarly and can be\nmanipulated during VC. Moreover, the proposed architecture is time-synchronized\nso that the original voice timing is preserved during conversion which allows\nlip-sync applications. Applied to voice gender conversion on the real-world\nVCTK dataset, our proposed architecture can learn successfully\ngender-independent representation and convert the voice gender with a very high\nefficiency and naturalness.",

But in this paper, we find this conclusion may not hold when the\ntarget dataset has very few labeled samples for finetuning, \\ie, few-label\ntransfer. We analyze the possible reason from the clustering perspective: 1)\nThe clustering quality of target samples is of great importance to few-label\ntransfer; 2) Though contrastive learning is essential to learn how to cluster,\nits clustering quality is still inferior to supervised pretraining due to lack\nof label supervision. Based on the analysis, we interestingly discover that\nonly involving some unlabeled target domain into the unsupervised pretraining\ncan improve the clustering quality, subsequently reducing the transfer\nperformance gap with supervised pretraining. This finding also motivates us to\npropose a new progressive few-label transfer algorithm for real applications,\nwhich aims to maximize the transfer performance under a limited annotation\nbudget. To support our analysis and proposed method, we conduct extensive\nexperiments on nine different target datasets.

We demonstrate that\nADR-bandit has nearly optimal performance when the abrupt or global changes\noccur in a coordinated manner that we call global changes.

Posterior distributions\nare typically computed from collections of individual participant actions, yet\nare used to draw conclusions about the internal structure of participant\nbeliefs. Also not explicitly measured are the prior distributions that\ndistinguish Bayesian models from others by representing initial states of\nbelief. Instead, priors are usually derived from experimenters' intuitions or\nmodel assumptions and applied equally to all participants. Here we present\nthree experiments using \"Plinko\", a behavioral task in which participants\nestimate distributions of ball drops over all available outcomes and where\ndistributions are explicitly measured before any observations. In Experiment 1,\nwe show that participant priors cluster around prototypical probability\ndistributions (Gaussian, bimodal, etc.), and that prior cluster membership may\nindicate learning ability. In Experiment 2, we highlight participants' ability\nto update to unannounced changes of presented distributions and how this\nability is affected by environmental manipulation. Finally, in Experiment 3, we\nverify that individual participant priors are reliable representations and that\nlearning is not impeded when faced with a physically implausible ball drop\ndistribution that is dynamically defined according to individual participant\ninput.

On smooth nonconvex problems, a few acceleration\ntechniques have been applied to improve the convergence rate of SGMs. However,\nlittle exploration has been made on applying a certain acceleration technique\nto a stochastic subgradient method (SsGM) for nonsmooth nonconvex problems. In\naddition, few efforts have been made to analyze an (accelerated) SsGM with\ndelayed derivatives. The information delay naturally happens in a distributed\nsystem, where computing workers do not coordinate with each other.\nIn this paper, we propose an inertial proximal SsGM for solving nonsmooth\nnonconvex stochastic optimization problems. The proposed method can have\nguaranteed convergence even with delayed derivative information in a\ndistributed environment. Convergence rate results are established to three\nclasses of nonconvex problems: weakly-convex nonsmooth problems with a convex\nregularizer, composite nonconvex problems with a nonsmooth convex regularizer,\nand smooth nonconvex problems. For each problem class, the convergence rate is\n$O(1/K^{\\frac{1}{2}})$ in the expected value of the gradient norm square, for\n$K$ iterations. In a distributed environment, the convergence rate of the\nproposed method will be slowed down by the information delay. Nevertheless, the\nslow-down effect will decay with the number of iterations for the latter two\nproblem classes. We test the proposed method on three applications. The\nnumerical results clearly demonstrate the advantages of using the\ninertial-based acceleration. Furthermore, we observe higher parallelization\nspeed-up in asynchronous updates over the synchronous counterpart, though the\nformer uses delayed derivatives.",

Until now, there have being\ndeveloped several techniques for imaging of a single object through scattering\nmedium by using neural networks, however how to reconstruct images of more than\none object simultaneously seems hard to realize. In this paper, we demonstrate\nan approach by using generative adversarial network (GAN) to reconstruct images\nof two adjacent objects through scattering media. We construct an imaging\nsystem for imaging of two adjacent objects behind the scattering media. In\ngeneral, as the light field of two adjacent object images pass through the\nscattering slab, a speckle pattern is obtained. The designed adversarial\nnetwork, which is called as YGAN, is employed to reconstruct the images\nsimultaneously. It is shown that based on the trained YGAN, we can reconstruct\nimages of two adjacent objects from one speckle pattern with high fidelity. In\naddition, we study the influence of the object image types, and the distance\nbetween the two adjacent objects on the fidelity of the reconstructed images.\nMoreover even if another scattering medium is inserted between the two objects,\nwe can also reconstruct the images of two objects from a speckle with high\nquality.

However, a common challenge is low image\nquality arising from undersampling. Deep learning (DL) is an emerging and\npowerful tool in computational imaging for many applications and researchers\nhave applied DL in SPI to achieve higher image quality than conventional\nreconstruction approaches. One outstanding challenge, however, is that the\naccuracy of DL predictions in SPI cannot be assessed in practical applications\nwhere the ground truths are unknown. Here, we propose the use of the Bayesian\nconvolutional neural network (BCNN) to approximate the uncertainty (coming from\nfinite training data and network model) of the DL predictions in SPI. Each\npixel in the predicted result from BCNN represents the parameter of a\nprobability distribution rather than the image intensity value. Then, the\nuncertainty can be approximated with BCNN by minimizing a negative\nlog-likelihood loss function in the training stage and Monte Carlo dropout in\nthe prediction stage. The results show that the BCNN can reliably approximate\nthe uncertainty of the DL predictions in SPI with varying compression ratios\nand noise levels. The predicted uncertainty from BCNN in SPI reveals that most\nof the reconstruction errors in deep-learning-based SPI come from the edges of\nthe image features.

    "abstract": "Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) is recognized as a\nunifying framework for modeling a wide range of problems. Problems can be\nsolved with commercial solvers customized for solving QUBO and since QUBO have\ndegree two, it is useful to have a method for transforming higher degree\npseudo-Boolean problems to QUBO format. The standard transformation approach\nrequires additional auxiliary variables supported by penalty terms for each\nhigher degree term. This paper improves on the existing cubic-to-quadratic\ntransformation approach by minimizing the number of additional variables as\nwell as penalty coefficient. Extensive experimental testing on Max 3-SAT\nmodeled as QUBO shows a near 100% reduction in the subproblem size used for\nminimization of the number of auxiliary variables.",

    "abstract": "Neuromorphic vision sensors (NVS) can enable energy savings due to their\nevent-driven that exploits the temporal redundancy in video streams from a\nstationary camera. However, noise-driven events lead to the false triggering of\nthe object recognition processor. Image denoise operations require\nmemoryintensive processing leading to a bottleneck in energy and latency. In\nthis paper, we present in-memory filtering (IMF), a 6TSRAM in-memory computing\nbased image denoising for eventbased binary image (EBBI) frame from an NVS. We\npropose a non-overlap median filter (NOMF) for image denoising. An inmemory\ncomputing framework enables hardware implementation of NOMF leveraging the\ninherent read disturb phenomenon of 6T-SRAM. To demonstrate the energy-saving\nand effectiveness of the algorithm, we fabricated the proposed architecture in\na 65nm CMOS process. As compared to fully digital implementation, IMF enables >\n70x energy savings and a > 3x improvement of processing time when tested with\nthe video recordings from a DAVIS sensor and achieves a peak throughput of\n134.4 GOPS. Furthermore, the peak energy efficiencies of the NOMF is 51.3\nTOPS/W, comparable with state of the art inmemory processors. We also show that\nthe accuracy of the images obtained by NOMF provide comparable accuracy in\ntracking and classification applications when compared with images obtained by\nconventional median filtering.",

    "abstract": "Statistical signal processing applications usually require the estimation of\nsome parameters of interest given a set of observed data. These estimates are\ntypically obtained either by solving a multi-variate optimization problem, as\nin the maximum likelihood (ML) or maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimators, or by\nperforming a multi-dimensional integration, as in the minimum mean squared\nerror (MMSE) estimators. Unfortunately, analytical expressions for these\nestimators cannot be found in most real-world applications, and the Monte Carlo\n(MC) methodology is one feasible approach. MC methods proceed by drawing random\nsamples, either from the desired distribution or from a simpler one, and using\nthem to compute consistent estimators. The most important families of MC\nalgorithms are Markov chain MC (MCMC) and importance sampling (IS). On the one\nhand, MCMC methods draw samples from a proposal density, building then an\nergodic Markov chain whose stationary distribution is the desired distribution\nby accepting or rejecting those candidate samples as the new state of the\nchain. On the other hand, IS techniques draw samples from a simple proposal\ndensity, and then assign them suitable weights that measure their quality in\nsome appropriate way. In this paper, we perform a thorough review of MC methods\nfor the estimation of static parameters in signal processing applications.

The fundamental\narchitecture of the proposed DiffuSE model is similar to that of DiffWave--a\nhigh-quality audio waveform generation model that has a relatively low\ncomputational cost and footprint.

    "abstract": "Data from multi-modality provide complementary information in clinical\nprediction, but missing data in clinical cohorts limits the number of subjects\nin multi-modal learning context. Multi-modal missing imputation is challenging\nwith existing methods when 1) the missing data span across heterogeneous\nmodalities (e.g., image vs. non-image); or 2) one modality is largely missing.\nIn this paper, we address imputation of missing data by modeling the joint\ndistribution of multi-modal data. Motivated by partial bidirectional generative\nadversarial net (PBiGAN), we propose a new Conditional PBiGAN (C-PBiGAN) method\nthat imputes one modality combining the conditional knowledge from another\nmodality. Specifically, C-PBiGAN introduces a conditional latent space in a\nmissing imputation framework that jointly encodes the available multi-modal\ndata, along with a class regularization loss on imputed data to recover\ndiscriminative information. To our knowledge, it is the first generative\nadversarial model that addresses multi-modal missing imputation by modeling the\njoint distribution of image and non-image data. We validate our model with both\nthe national lung screening trial (NLST) dataset and an external clinical\nvalidation cohort. The proposed C-PBiGAN achieves significant improvements in\nlung cancer risk estimation compared with representative imputation methods\n(e.g., AUC values increase in both NLST (+2.9\\%) and in-house dataset (+4.3\\%)\ncompared with PBiGAN, p$<$0.05).",

PS is a conventional technique in optics to measure phase\ndifference between two waves at different frequencies of the spectrum. Here we\nadapt PS for the same purpose in the radio frequency band. We show that we can\nemulate a large array exploiting only two antennas. To this end, we measure\nphase difference between the two antennas for different frequencies using PS.\nConsequently, we demonstrate that we can radically reduce the complexity of the\nreceiver required for DoA estimation employing PS. We consider two different\nschemes for implementation of PS: via a long wave-guide and frequency\ncode-book. We show that using a frequency code-book, higher processing gain can\nbe achieved. Moreover, we introduce three PS architectures: for device to\ndevice DoA estimation, for base-station in uplink scenario and an ultra-fast\nDoA estimation technique mainly for radar and aerial and satellite\ncommunications. Simulation and analytical results show that, PS is capable of\ndetecting and discriminating between multiple incoming signals with different\nDoAs. Moreover, our results also show that, the angular resolution of PS\ndepends on the distance between the two antennas and the band-width of the\nfrequency code-book. Finally, the performance of PS is compared with a uniform\nlinear array (ULA) and it is shown that PS can perform the same, with a much\nless complex receiver, and without the prerequisite of spatial search for DoA\nestimation.",

Thus, there is substantial value in\nunderstanding the performance of index policies and other policies that can be\ncomputed efficiently for large $N$. We study the growth of the optimality gap,\ni.e., the loss in expected performance compared to an optimal policy, for such\npolicies in a classical asymptotic regime proposed by Whittle in which $N$\ngrows while holding constant the fraction of arms that can be pulled per\nperiod. Intuition from the Central Limit Theorem and the tightest previous\ntheoretical bounds suggest that this optimality gap should grow like\n$O(\\sqrt{N})$.

Reconstructed four-chamber\nviews of the heart on chest CT can detect right ventricular enlargement. CT\npulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the golden standard in the diagnostic workup of\nsuspected PE. Therefore, it can link between diagnosis and risk stratification\nstrategies. We developed a weakly supervised deep learning algorithm, with an\nemphasis on a novel attention mechanism, to automatically classify RV strain on\nCTPA. Our method is a 3D DenseNet model with integrated 3D residual attention\nblocks. We evaluated our model on a dataset of CTPAs of emergency department\n(ED) PE patients. This model achieved an area under the receiver operating\ncharacteristic curve (AUC) of 0.88 for classifying RV strain. The model showed\na sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 83.7%. Our solution outperforms\nstate-of-the-art 3D CNN networks. The proposed design allows for a fully\nautomated network that can be trained easily in an end-to-end manner without\nrequiring computationally intensive and time-consuming preprocessing or\nstrenuous labeling of the data.We infer that unmarked CTPAs can be used for\neffective RV strain classification. This could be used as a second reader,\nalerting for high-risk PE patients. To the best of our knowledge, there are no\nprevious deep learning-based studies that attempted to solve this problem.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present UR-AIR system submission to the logical access (LA)\nand the speech deepfake (DF) tracks of the ASVspoof 2021 Challenge. The LA and\nDF tasks focus on synthetic speech detection (SSD), i.e. detecting\ntext-to-speech and voice conversion as spoofing attacks. Different from\nprevious ASVspoof challenges, the LA task this year presents codec and\ntransmission channel variability, while the new task DF presents general audio\ncompression. Built upon our previous research work on improving the robustness\nof the SSD systems to channel effects, we propose a channel-robust synthetic\nspeech detection system for the challenge. To mitigate the channel variability\nissue, we use an acoustic simulator to apply transmission codec, compression\ncodec, and convolutional impulse responses to the original datasets. For the\nneural network backbone, we propose to use Emphasized Channel Attention,\nPropagation and Aggregation Time Delay Neural Networks (ECAPA-TDNN) as our\nprimary model. We also incorporate one-class learning with channel-robust\ntraining strategies to further learn a channel-invariant speech representation.\nOur submission achieved EER 20.33% in the DF task; EER 5.46% and min-tDCF\n0.3094 in the LA task.",

Unfortunately, such a \"Pigouvian\" tax may also induce other,\nsocially inefficient, equilibria. We observe that this social inefficiency may\nbe unbounded, and study whether alternative tax structures may lead to milder\nlosses in the worst case, i.e. to a lower price of anarchy. We show that no tax\nstructure leads to bounded losses in the worst case.

In this paper, we experimented with transfer learning\nand adaptation of a Tacotron2 text-to-speech model to improve the final\nsynthesis quality of ultrasound-based articulatory-to-acoustic mapping with a\nlimited database. We use a multi-speaker pre-trained Tacotron2 TTS model and a\npre-trained WaveGlow neural vocoder.

In the paper, thus, we propose a class\nof efficient bilevel optimization methods based on Bregman distance. In our\nmethods, we use the mirror decent iteration to solve the outer subproblem of\nthe bilevel problem by using strongly-convex Bregman functions. Specifically,\nwe propose a bilevel optimization method based on Bregman distance (BiO-BreD)\nfor solving deterministic bilevel problems, which reaches the lower\ncomputational complexities than the best known results. We also propose a\nstochastic bilevel optimization method (SBiO-BreD) for solving stochastic\nbilevel problems based on the stochastic approximated gradients and Bregman\ndistance. Further, we propose an accelerated version of SBiO-BreD method\n(ASBiO-BreD) by using the variance-reduced technique.

    "title": "MAG-Net: Mutli-task attention guided network for brain tumor  segmentation and classification",
    "abstract": "Brain tumor is the most common and deadliest disease that can be found in all\nage groups. Generally, MRI modality is adopted for identifying and diagnosing\ntumors by the radiologists. The correct identification of tumor regions and its\ntype can aid to diagnose tumors with the followup treatment plans. However, for\nany radiologist analysing such scans is a complex and time-consuming task.\nMotivated by the deep learning based computer-aided-diagnosis systems, this\npaper proposes multi-task attention guided encoder-decoder network (MAG-Net) to\nclassify and segment the brain tumor regions using MRI images. The MAG-Net is\ntrained and evaluated on the Figshare dataset that includes coronal, axial, and\nsagittal views with 3 types of tumors meningioma, glioma, and pituitary tumor.\nWith exhaustive experimental trials the model achieved promising results as\ncompared to existing state-of-the-art models, while having least number of\ntraining parameters among other state-of-the-art models.",

    "title": "Structure-Preserving Multi-Domain Stain Color Augmentation using  Style-Transfer with Disentangled Representations",
    "abstract": "In digital pathology, different staining procedures and scanners cause\nsubstantial color variations in whole-slide images (WSIs), especially across\ndifferent laboratories. These color shifts result in a poor generalization of\ndeep learning-based methods from the training domain to external pathology\ndata. To increase test performance, stain normalization techniques are used to\nreduce the variance between training and test domain. Alternatively, color\naugmentation can be applied during training leading to a more robust model\nwithout the extra step of color normalization at test time. We propose a novel\ncolor augmentation technique, HistAuGAN, that can simulate a wide variety of\nrealistic histology stain colors, thus making neural networks stain-invariant\nwhen applied during training. Based on a generative adversarial network (GAN)\nfor image-to-image translation, our model disentangles the content of the\nimage, i.e., the morphological tissue structure, from the stain color\nattributes. It can be trained on multiple domains and, therefore, learns to\ncover different stain colors as well as other domain-specific variations\nintroduced in the slide preparation and imaging process. We demonstrate that\nHistAuGAN outperforms conventional color augmentation techniques on a\nclassification task on the publicly available dataset Camelyon17 and show that\nit is able to mitigate present batch effects.",

    "title": "Inference for Heteroskedastic PCA with Missing Data",
    "abstract": "This paper studies how to construct confidence regions for principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA) in high dimension, a problem that has been vastly\nunder-explored. While computing measures of uncertainty for nonlinear/nonconvex\nestimators is in general difficult in high dimension, the challenge is further\ncompounded by the prevalent presence of missing data and heteroskedastic noise.\nWe propose a suite of solutions to perform valid inference on the principal\nsubspace based on two estimators: a vanilla SVD-based approach, and a more\nrefined iterative scheme called $\\textsf{HeteroPCA}$ (Zhang et al., 2018). We\ndevelop non-asymptotic distributional guarantees for both estimators, and\ndemonstrate how these can be invoked to compute both confidence regions for the\nprincipal subspace and entrywise confidence intervals for the spiked covariance\nmatrix. Particularly worth highlighting is the inference procedure built on top\nof $\\textsf{HeteroPCA}$, which is not only valid but also statistically\nefficient for broader scenarios (e.g., it covers a wider range of missing rates\nand signal-to-noise ratios). Our solutions are fully data-driven and adaptive\nto heteroskedastic random noise, without requiring prior knowledge about the\nnoise levels and noise distributions.",
