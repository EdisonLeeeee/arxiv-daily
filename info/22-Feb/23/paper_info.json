    "abstract": "Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is the problem of finding collision-free\npaths for multiple agents from their start locations to end locations. We\nconsider an extension to this problem, Precedence Constrained Multi-Agent Path\nFinding (PC-MAPF), wherein agents are assigned a sequence of planning tasks\nthat contain precedence constraints between them. PC-MAPF has various\napplications, for example in multi-agent pickup and delivery problems where\nsome objects might require multiple agents to collaboratively pickup and move\nthem in unison. Precedence constraints also arise in warehouse assembly\nproblems where before a manufacturing task can begin, its input resources must\nbe manufactured and delivered. We propose a novel algorithm, Precedence\nConstrained Conflict Based Search (PC-CBS), which finds makespan-optimal\nsolutions for this class of problems. PC-CBS utilizes a Precedence-Constrained\nTask-Graph to define valid intervals for each planning task and updates them\nwhen precedence conflicts are encountered. We benchmark the performance of this\nalgorithm over various warehouse assembly, and multi-agent pickup and delivery\ntasks, and use it to evaluate the sub-optimality of a recently proposed\nefficient baseline.",

    "abstract": "Automatic machine learning, or AutoML, holds the promise of truly\ndemocratizing the use of machine learning (ML), by substantially automating the\nwork of data scientists. However, the huge combinatorial search space of\ncandidate pipelines means that current AutoML techniques, generate sub-optimal\npipelines, or none at all, especially on large, complex datasets. In this work\nwe propose an AutoML technique SapientML, that can learn from a corpus of\nexisting datasets and their human-written pipelines, and efficiently generate a\nhigh-quality pipeline for a predictive task on a new dataset. To combat the\nsearch space explosion of AutoML, SapientML employs a novel divide-and-conquer\nstrategy realized as a three-stage program synthesis approach, that reasons on\nsuccessively smaller search spaces. The first stage uses a machine-learned\nmodel to predict a set of plausible ML components to constitute a pipeline. In\nthe second stage, this is then refined into a small pool of viable concrete\npipelines using syntactic constraints derived from the corpus and the\nmachine-learned model. Dynamically evaluating these few pipelines, in the third\nstage, provides the best solution. We instantiate SapientML as part of a fully\nautomated tool-chain that creates a cleaned, labeled learning corpus by mining\nKaggle, learns from it, and uses the learned models to then synthesize\npipelines for new predictive tasks. We have created a training corpus of 1094\npipelines spanning 170 datasets, and evaluated SapientML on a set of 41\nbenchmark datasets, including 10 new, large, real-world datasets from Kaggle,\nand against 3 state-of-the-art AutoML tools and 2 baselines. Our evaluation\nshows that SapientML produces the best or comparable accuracy on 27 of the\nbenchmarks while the second best tool fails to even produce a pipeline on 9 of\nthe instances.",

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection is widely used to distinguish system anomalies by analyzing\nthe temporal and spatial features of wireless sensor network (WSN) data\nstreams; it is one of critical technique that ensures the reliability of WSNs.\nCurrently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become popular state-of-the-art\nmethods for conducting anomaly detection on WSN data streams. However, the\nexisting anomaly detection methods based on GNNs do not consider the temporal\nand spatial features of WSN data streams simultaneously, such as multi-node,\nmulti-modal and multi-time features, seriously impacting their effectiveness.\nIn this paper, a novel anomaly detection model is proposed for multimodal WSN\ndata flows, where three GNNs are used to separately extract the temporal\nfeatures of WSN data flows, the correlation features between different modes\nand the spatial features between sensor node positions. Specifically, first,\nthe temporal features and modal correlation features extracted from each sensor\nnode are fused into one vector representation, which is further aggregated with\nthe spatial features, i.e., the spatial position relationships of the nodes;\nfinally, the current time-series data of WSN nodes are predicted, and abnormal\nstates are identified according to the fusion features. The simulation results\nobtained on a public dataset show that the proposed approach is able to\nsignificantly improve upon the existing methods in terms of its robustness, and\nits F1 score reaches 0.90, which is 14.2% higher than that of the graph\nconvolution network (GCN) with long short-term memory (LSTM).",

    "abstract": "Network pruning and knowledge distillation are two widely-known model\ncompression methods that efficiently reduce computation cost and model size. A\ncommon problem in both pruning and distillation is to determine compressed\narchitecture, i.e., the exact number of filters per layer and layer\nconfiguration, in order to preserve most of the original model capacity. In\nspite of the great advances in existing works, the determination of an\nexcellent architecture still requires human interference or tremendous\nexperimentations. In this paper, we propose an architecture slimming method\nthat automates the layer configuration process. We start from the perspective\nthat the capacity of the over-parameterized model can be largely preserved by\nfinding the minimum number of filters preserving the maximum parameter variance\nper layer, resulting in a thin architecture. We formulate the determination of\ncompressed architecture as a one-step orthogonal linear transformation, and\nintegrate principle component analysis (PCA), where the variances of filters in\nthe first several projections are maximized. We demonstrate the rationality of\nour analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed method through extensive\nexperiments. In particular, we show that under the same overall compression\nrate, the compressed architecture determined by our method shows significant\nperformance gain over baselines after pruning and distillation. Surprisingly,\nwe find that the resulting layer-wise compression rates correspond to the layer\nsensitivities found by existing works through tremendous experimentations.",

Generally, such methods select these\ndifferent step sizes based on experimentation or stability considerations.\nMeanwhile for problems that evolve on a single time scale, adaptivity\napproaches that strive to control local temporal error are widely used to\nachieve numerical results of a desired accuracy with minimal computational\neffort, while alleviating the need for manual experimentation with different\ntime step sizes. However, there is a notable gap in the publication record on\nthe development of adaptive time-step controllers for multirate methods. In\nthis paper, we extend the single-rate controller work of Gustafsson (1994) to\nthe multirate method setting. Specifically, we develop controllers based on\npolynomial approximations to the principal error functions for both the \"fast\"\nand \"slow\" time scales within infinitesimal multirate (MRI) methods. We\nadditionally investigate a variety of approaches for estimating the errors\narising from each time scale within MRI methods. We then numerically evaluate\nthe proposed multirate controllers and error estimation strategies on a range\nof multirate test problems, comparing their performance against an estimated\noptimal performance.

Its influence can be seen in the power systems operation and the\nmarket as well. The power consumers habits and demand curves have been changed\nat a breakneck pace. In this work, a one year mixed integer programming (MIP)\nproblem has been developed to compare the power consumption between 2019 and\n2020 in the United States as an example regarding the COVID19 pandemic effect\nin order to better prepare for possible similar future events. 100 percent\nrenewable single microgrids (SMGs) are studied using wind turbines and\nphotovoltaics. Batteries are also employed since it is inevitable when the\nsystem uses renewables. Additionally, it is possible for the SMGs to trade\npower with the main grid as needed. The effect of the SMGs clustering to form\nthe multi microgrids (MMGs) is also considered. In order to investigate the\nrisk of the system during the COVID19 and formation of MMG, downside risk\nconstraints are applied to the proposed model. Furthermore, a stylized short\nrun consumers demand model is proposed, using elasticity and assessed responses\nregarding the average household consumption for households during on peak and\noff peak periods. The simulation results show that COVID19 generally reduces\nthe demand, increases the profit of the system, and decreases the economic risk\nof the power systems operation. Moreover, SMGs clustering to organize MMG\ndramatically enhances the profit of the system as well as improves the risk\nlevel of the system.",

First, most cluster\nassignment methods are based on simple distance comparison and highly dependent\non the target distribution generated by a handcrafted nonlinear mapping. These\nfacts largely limit the possible performance that deep clustering methods can\nreach. Second, the clustering results can be easily guided towards wrong\ndirection by the misassigned samples in each cluster. The existing deep\nclustering methods are incapable of discriminating such samples.

Fuzzy theory is used to score the\nsample membership with probability which evaluates the intermediate clustering\nresult certainty of each sample. Based on which, the most reliable samples can\nbe selected and augmented. The augmented data are employed to fine-tune an\noff-the-shelf deep network classifier with the labels from the clustering,\nwhich results in a model to generate the target distribution. The proposed\nframework can efficiently discriminate sample outliers and generate better\ntarget distribution with the assistance of self-supervised classifier.\nExtensive experiments indicate that the Self-EvoC remarkably outperforms\nstate-of-the-art deep clustering methods on three benchmark datasets.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel data-driven approach of learning traffic flow patterns of\na transportation network given that many instances of origin to destination\n(OD) travel demand and link flows of the network are available. Instead of\nestimating traffic flow patterns assuming certain user behavior (e.g., user\nequilibrium or system optimal), here we explore the idea of learning those flow\npatterns directly from the data. To implement this idea, we have formulated the\ntraffic-assignment problem as a data-driven learning problem and developed a\nneural network-based framework known as Graph Convolutional Neural Network\n(GCNN) to solve it. The proposed framework represents the transportation\nnetwork and OD demand in an efficient way and utilizes the diffusion process of\nmultiple OD demands from nodes to links. We validate the solutions of the model\nagainst analytical solutions generated from running static user\nequilibrium-based traffic assignments over Sioux Falls and East Massachusetts\nnetworks. The validation result shows that the implemented GCNN model can learn\nthe flow patterns very well with less than 2% mean absolute difference between\nthe actual and estimated link flows for both networks under varying congested\nconditions. When the training of the model is complete, it can instantly\ndetermine the traffic flows of a large-scale network. Hence this approach can\novercome the challenges of deploying traffic assignment models over large-scale\nnetworks and open new directions of research in data-driven network modeling.",

    "abstract": "Applying machine learning (ML) to sensitive domains requires privacy\nprotection of the underlying training data through formal privacy frameworks,\nsuch as differential privacy (DP). Yet, usually, the privacy of the training\ndata comes at the costs of the resulting ML models' utility. One reason for\nthis is that DP uses one homogeneous privacy budget epsilon for all training\ndata points, which has to align with the strictest privacy requirement\nencountered among all data holders. In practice, different data holders might\nhave different privacy requirements and data points of data holders with lower\nrequirements could potentially contribute more information to the training\nprocess of the ML models. To account for this possibility, we propose three\nnovel methods that extend the DP framework Private Aggregation of Teacher\nEnsembles (PATE) to support training an ML model with different personalized\nprivacy guarantees within the training data. We formally describe the methods,\nprovide theoretical analyses of their privacy bounds, and experimentally\nevaluate their effect on the final model's utility at the example of the MNIST\nand Adult income datasets.

    "abstract": "In real-time rendering, a 3D scene is modelled with meshes of triangles that\nthe GPU projects to the screen. They are discretized by sampling each triangle\nat regular space intervals to generate fragments which are then added texture\nand lighting effects by a shader program. Realistic scenes require detailed\ngeometric models, complex shaders, high-resolution displays and high screen\nrefreshing rates, which all come at a great compute time and energy cost. This\ncost is often dominated by the fragment shader, which runs for each sampled\nfragment. Conventional GPUs sample the triangles once per pixel, however, there\nare many screen regions containing low variation that produce identical\nfragments and could be sampled at lower than pixel-rate with no loss in\nquality. Additionally, as temporal frame coherence makes consecutive frames\nvery similar, such variations are usually maintained from frame to frame. This\nwork proposes Dynamic Sampling Rate (DSR), a novel hardware mechanism to reduce\nredundancy and improve the energy efficiency in graphics applications. DSR\nanalyzes the spatial frequencies of the scene once it has been rendered. Then,\nit leverages the temporal coherence in consecutive frames to decide, for each\nregion of the screen, the lowest sampling rate to employ in the next frame that\nmaintains image quality. We evaluate the performance of a state-of-the-art\nmobile GPU architecture extended with DSR for a wide variety of applications.\nExperimental results show that DSR is able to remove most of the redundancy\ninherent in the color computations at fragment granularity, which brings\naverage speedups of 1.68x and energy savings of 40%.",

In\nthis work, we propose a pre-training scheme and a new loss function for\nimproving deep-learning-based nowcasting. First, we adapt U-Net, a widely-used\ndeep-learning model, for the two problems of interest here: precipitation\nnowcasting and precipitation estimation from radar images. We formulate the\nformer as a classification problem with three precipitation intervals and the\nlatter as a regression problem. For these tasks, we propose to pre-train the\nmodel to predict radar images in the near future without requiring ground-truth\nprecipitation, and we also propose the use of a new loss function for\nfine-tuning to mitigate the class imbalance problem. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach using radar images and precipitation datasets\ncollected from South Korea over seven years. It is highlighted that our\npre-training scheme and new loss function improve the critical success index\n(CSI) of nowcasting of heavy rainfall (at least 10 mm/hr) by up to 95.7% and\n43.6%, respectively, at a 5-hr lead time.

    "abstract": "Deep generative models have demonstrated effectiveness in learning compact\nand expressive design representations that significantly improve geometric\ndesign optimization. However, these models do not consider the uncertainty\nintroduced by manufacturing or fabrication. Past work that quantifies such\nuncertainty often makes simplifying assumptions on geometric variations, while\nthe \"real-world\", \"free-form\" uncertainty and its impact on design performance\nare difficult to quantify due to the high dimensionality. To address this\nissue, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network-based Design under\nUncertainty Framework (GAN-DUF), which contains a deep generative model that\nsimultaneously learns a compact representation of nominal (ideal) designs and\nthe conditional distribution of fabricated designs given any nominal design.\nThis opens up new possibilities of 1)~building a universal uncertainty\nquantification model compatible with both shape and topological designs,\n2)~modeling free-form geometric uncertainties without the need to make any\nassumptions on the distribution of geometric variability, and 3)~allowing fast\nprediction of uncertainties for new nominal designs. We can combine the\nproposed deep generative model with robust design optimization or\nreliability-based design optimization for design under uncertainty.

    "abstract": "Inspired by the recent success of deep learning in diverse domains,\ndata-driven metamaterials design has emerged as a compelling design paradigm to\nunlock the potential of multiscale architecture. However, existing\nmodel-centric approaches lack principled methodologies dedicated to\nhigh-quality data generation. Resorting to space-filling design in shape\ndescriptor space, existing metamaterial datasets suffer from property\ndistributions that are either highly imbalanced or at odds with design tasks of\ninterest. To this end, we propose t-METASET: an intelligent data acquisition\nframework for task-aware dataset generation. We seek a solution to a\ncommonplace yet frequently overlooked scenario at early design stages: when a\nmassive ($~\\sim O(10^4)$) shape library has been prepared with no properties\nevaluated. The key idea is to exploit a data-driven shape descriptor learned\nfrom generative models, fit a sparse regressor as the start-up agent, and\nleverage diversity-related metrics to drive data acquisition to areas that help\ndesigners fulfill design goals. We validate the proposed framework in three\nhypothetical deployment scenarios, which encompass general use, task-aware use,\nand tailorable use. Two large-scale shape-only mechanical metamaterial datasets\nare used as test datasets. The results demonstrate that t-METASET can\nincrementally grow task-aware datasets.

In this paper, we found that the recent\nemerging paradigm of implicit neural representations (INRs) that encodes a\ncontinuous signal into a parameterized neural network effectively mitigates the\nissue. By utilizing INRs of video, we propose dynamics-aware implicit\ngenerative adversarial network (DIGAN), a novel generative adversarial network\nfor video generation.

The volume of data to handle, and still elusive need to have the\nregistration occur fully reliably and fully automatically, mean there is a need\nto innovate further. One largely untapped area of innovation is that of\nexploiting the {\\em semantic information} of the points in question.

It is also\ntimely - due to the recent advances in semantic classification capabilities.\nThis paper advances this theme by demonstrating that state of the art\nregistration techniques, in particular ones that rely on \"preservation of\nlength under rigid motion\" as an underlying matching consistency constraint,\ncan be augmented with semantic information. Semantic identity is of course also\npreserved under rigid-motion, but also under wider motions present in a scene.\nWe demonstrate that not only the potential obstacle of cost of semantic\nsegmentation, and the potential obstacle of the unreliability of semantic\nsegmentation; are both no impediment to achieving both speed and accuracy in\nfully automatic registration of large scale point clouds.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: As databases grow larger, it becomes harder to fully control\ntheir collection, and they frequently come with missing values: incomplete\nobservations. These large databases are well suited to train machine-learning\nmodels, for instance for forecasting or to extract biomarkers in biomedical\nsettings. Such predictive approaches can use discriminative -- rather than\ngenerative -- modeling, and thus open the door to new missing-values\nstrategies. Yet existing empirical evaluations of strategies to handle missing\nvalues have focused on inferential statistics. RESULTS: Here we conduct a\nsystematic benchmark of missing-values strategies in predictive models with a\nfocus on large health databases: four electronic health record datasets, a\npopulation brain imaging one, a health survey and two intensive care ones.\nUsing gradient-boosted trees, we compare native support for missing values with\nsimple and state-of-the-art imputation prior to learning. We investigate\nprediction accuracy and computational time. For prediction after imputation, we\nfind that adding an indicator to express which values have been imputed is\nimportant, suggesting that the data are missing not at random. Elaborate\nmissing values imputation can improve prediction compared to simple strategies\nbut requires longer computational time on large data. Learning trees that model\nmissing values-with missing incorporated attribute-leads to robust, fast, and\nwell-performing predictive modeling. CONCLUSIONS: Native support for missing\nvalues in supervised machine learning predicts better than state-of-the-art\nimputation with much less computational cost. When using imputation, it is\nimportant to add indicator columns expressing which values have been imputed.",

    "abstract": "Despite recent successes in natural language processing and computer vision,\nTransformer suffers from the scalability problem when dealing with graphs. The\ncomputational complexity is unacceptable for large-scale graphs, e.g.,\nknowledge graphs. One solution is to consider only the near neighbors, which,\nhowever, will lose the key merit of Transformer to attend to the elements at\nany distance. In this paper, we propose a new Transformer architecture, named\ndual-encoding Transformer (DET). DET has a structural encoder to aggregate\ninformation from connected neighbors and a semantic encoder to focus on\nsemantically useful distant nodes. In comparison with resorting to multi-hop\nneighbors, DET seeks the desired distant neighbors via self-supervised\ntraining. We further find these two encoders can be incorporated to boost each\nothers' performance. Our experiments demonstrate DET has achieved superior\nperformance compared to the respective state-of-the-art methods in dealing with\nmolecules, networks and knowledge graphs with various sizes.",

To\nmaximize data-reduction efficiency, existing post-deduplication\ndelta-compression techniques perform delta compression along with traditional\ndata deduplication and lossless compression. Unfortunately, we observe that\nexisting techniques achieve significantly lower data-reduction ratios than the\noptimal due to their limited accuracy in identifying similar data blocks.\nIn this paper, we propose DeepSketch, a new reference search technique for\npost-deduplication delta compression that leverages the learning-to-hash method\nto achieve higher accuracy in reference search for delta compression, thereby\nimproving data-reduction efficiency. DeepSketch uses a deep neural network to\nextract a data block's sketch, i.e., to create an approximate data signature of\nthe block that can preserve similarity with other blocks. Our evaluation using\neleven real-world workloads shows that DeepSketch improves the data-reduction\nratio by up to 33% (21% on average) over a state-of-the-art post-deduplication\ndelta-compression technique.",

    "abstract": "A temporal point process is a stochastic process that predicts which type of\nevents is likely to happen and when the event will occur given a history of a\nsequence of events. There are various examples of occurrence dynamics in the\ndaily life, and it is important to train the temporal dynamics and solve two\ndifferent prediction problems, time and type predictions. Especially, deep\nneural network based models have outperformed the statistical models, such as\nHawkes processes and Poisson processes. However, many existing approaches\noverfit to specific events, instead of learning and predicting various event\ntypes. Therefore, such approaches could not cope with the modified\nrelationships between events and fail to predict the intensity functions of\ntemporal point processes very well. In this paper, to solve these problems, we\npropose a variational neural temporal point process (VNTPP). We introduce the\ninference and the generative networks, and train a distribution of latent\nvariable to deal with stochastic property on deep neural network. The intensity\nfunctions are computed using the distribution of latent variable so that we can\npredict event types and the arrival times of the events more accurately. We\nempirically demonstrate that our model can generalize the representations of\nvarious event types. Moreover, we show quantitatively and qualitatively that\nour model outperforms other deep neural network based models and statistical\nprocesses on synthetic and real-world datasets.",

    "abstract": "Time series forecasting plays a key role in a variety of domains. In a lot of\nreal-world scenarios, there exist multiple forecasting entities (e.g. power\nstation in the solar system, stations in the traffic system). A straightforward\nforecasting solution is to mine the temporal dependency for each individual\nentity through 1d-CNN, RNN, transformer, etc. This approach overlooks the\nrelations between these entities and, in consequence, loses the opportunity to\nimprove performance using spatial-temporal relation. However, in many\nreal-world scenarios, beside explicit relation, there could exist crucial yet\nimplicit relation between entities. How to discover the useful implicit\nrelation between entities and effectively utilize the relations for each entity\nunder various circumstances is crucial. In order to mine the implicit relation\nbetween entities as much as possible and dynamically utilize the relation to\nimprove the forecasting performance, we propose an attentional multi-graph\nneural network with automatic graph learning (A2GNN) in this work.\nParticularly, a Gumbel-softmax based auto graph learner is designed to\nautomatically capture the implicit relation among forecasting entities. We\nfurther propose an attentional relation learner that enables every entity to\ndynamically pay attention to its preferred relations.

Recent advances in Machine\nLearning, Natural Language Processing, voice recognition, and speech processing\ntechnologies have naturally allowed the development and deployment of\nspeech-based conversational interfaces to interact with various\nmachine-critical applications. While these conversational interfaces have\nallowed users to give voice commands to carry out strategic and critical\nactivities, their robustness to adversarial attacks remains uncertain and\nunclear. Indeed, Adversarial Artificial Intelligence (AI) which refers to a set\nof techniques that attempt to fool machine learning models with deceptive data,\nis a growing threat in the AI and machine learning research community, in\nparticular for machine-critical applications. The most common reason of\nadversarial attacks is to cause a malfunction in a machine learning model.

While focusing on speech recognition\nfor machine-critical applications, in this paper, we first review existing\nspeech recognition techniques, then, we investigate the effectiveness of\nadversarial attacks and defenses against these systems, before outlining\nresearch challenges, defense recommendations, and future work.

The first approach works directly\nwith the orientation matrix and therefore eschews the need for generalized\ncoordinates used to produce the orientation matrix $ \\mathbf{A} $. The approach\nis informed by the fact that rotation matrices belong to the SO(3) Lie matrix\ngroup. The second approach employs Euler parameters, while the third uses Euler\nangles. In all cases, the index 3 DAE problem is solved via a first order\nimplicit numerical integrator.

The tests were carried out in\nconjunction with four 3D mechanisms. The improvements in simulation speed of\nthe $ \\mathbf{rA} $ approach are traced back to a simpler form of the equations\nof motion and more concise Jacobians that enter the numerical solution. The\ncontributions made herein are twofold. First, we provide first order variations\nof all the quantities that enter the $ \\mathbf{rA} $ formulation when used in\nthe context of implicit integration; i.e., sensitivity of the kinematic\nconstraints for all lower pair joints, as well as the sensitivity of the\nconstraint reaction forces.

In this work, we study a machine learning formulation of\nthese types of mechanisms, presenting algorithms that are no-regret from the\nbuyer's perspective. Specifically, a buyer who wishes to maximize his utility\ninteracts repeatedly with a platform over a series of $T$ rounds. In each\nround, a new item is drawn from an unknown distribution and the platform\npublishes a price together with incomplete, \"masked\" information about the\nitem. The buyer then decides whether to purchase the item. We formalize this\nproblem as an online learning task where the goal is to have low regret with\nrespect to a myopic oracle that has perfect knowledge of the distribution over\nitems and the seller's masking function. When the distribution over items is\nknown to the buyer and the mask is a SimHash function mapping $\\mathbb{R}^d$ to\n$\\{0,1\\}^{\\ell}$, our algorithm has regret $\\tilde\n{\\mathcal{O}}((Td\\ell)^{\\frac{1}{2}})$.

    "abstract": "Precisely modeling interactions and accurately predicting trajectories of\nsurrounding vehicles are essential to the decision-making and path-planning of\nintelligent vehicles. This paper proposes a novel framework based on ensemble\nlearning to improve the performance of trajectory predictions in interactive\nscenarios. The framework is termed Interactive Ensemble Trajectory Predictor\n(IETP). IETP assembles interaction-aware trajectory predictors as base learners\nto build an ensemble learner. Firstly, each base learner in IETP observes\nhistorical trajectories of vehicles in the scene. Then each base learner\nhandles interactions between vehicles to predict trajectories. Finally, an\nensemble learner is built to predict trajectories by applying two ensemble\nstrategies on the predictions from all base learners. Predictions generated by\nthe ensemble learner are final outputs of IETP. In this study, three\nexperiments using different data are conducted based on the NGSIM dataset.\nExperimental results show that IETP improves the predicting accuracy and\ndecreases the variance of errors compared to base learners. In addition, IETP\nexceeds baseline models with 50% of the training data, indicating that IETP is\ndata-efficient. Moreover, the implementation of IETP is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/BIT-Jack/IETP.",

    "abstract": "DNNs' demand for massive data forces practitioners to collect data from the\nInternet without careful check due to the unacceptable cost, which brings\npotential risks of backdoor attacks. A backdoored model always predicts a\ntarget class in the presence of a predefined trigger pattern, which can be\neasily realized via poisoning a small amount of data. In general, adversarial\ntraining is believed to defend against backdoor attacks since it helps models\nto keep their prediction unchanged even if we perturb the input image (as long\nas within a feasible range). Unfortunately, few previous studies succeed in\ndoing so. To explore whether adversarial training could defend against backdoor\nattacks or not, we conduct extensive experiments across different threat models\nand perturbation budgets, and find the threat model in adversarial training\nmatters. For instance, adversarial training with spatial adversarial examples\nprovides notable robustness against commonly-used patch-based backdoor attacks.\nWe further propose a hybrid strategy which provides satisfactory robustness\nacross different backdoor attacks.",

    "abstract": "The huge amount of data generated by the Internet of things (IoT) devices\nneeds the computational power and storage capacity provided by cloud, edge, and\nfog computing paradigms. Each of these computing paradigms has its own pros and\ncons. Cloud computing provides enhanced data storage and computing power but\ncauses high communication latency. Edge and fog computing provide similar\nservices with lower latency but with limited capacity, capability, and\ncoverage. A single computing paradigm cannot fulfil all the requirements of IoT\ndevices and a federation between them is needed to extend their capacity,\ncapability, and services. This federation is beneficial to both subscribers and\nproviders and also reveals research issues in traffic offloading between\nclouds, edges, and fogs. Optimization has traditionally been used to solve the\nproblem of traffic offloading. However, in such a complex federated system,\ntraditional optimization cannot keep up with the strict latency requirements of\ndecision making, ranging from milliseconds to sub-seconds. Machine learning\napproaches, especially reinforcement learning, are consequently becoming\npopular because they can quickly solve offloading problems in dynamic\nenvironments with large amounts of unknown information. This study provides a\nnovel federal classification between cloud, edge, and fog and presents a\ncomprehensive research roadmap on offloading for different federated scenarios.\nWe survey the relevant literature on the various optimization approaches used\nto solve this offloading problem, and compare their salient features.

    "abstract": "In data-rich domains such as vision, language, and speech, deep learning\nprevails to deliver high-performance task-specific models and can even learn\ngeneral task-agnostic representations for efficient finetuning to downstream\ntasks. However, deep learning in resource-limited domains still faces the\nfollowing challenges including (i) limited data, (ii) constrained model\ndevelopment cost, and (iii) lack of adequate pre-trained models for effective\nfinetuning. This paper introduces a new technique called model reprogramming to\nbridge this gap. Model reprogramming enables resource-efficient cross-domain\nmachine learning by repurposing and reusing a well-developed pre-trained model\nfrom a source domain to solve tasks in a target domain without model\nfinetuning, where the source and target domains can be vastly different. In\nmany applications, model reprogramming outperforms transfer learning and\ntraining from scratch. This paper elucidates the methodology of model\nreprogramming, summarizes existing use cases, provides a theoretical\nexplanation on the success of model reprogramming, and concludes with a\ndiscussion on open-ended research questions and opportunities.

    "abstract": "Penetration Testing plays a critical role in evaluating the security of a\ntarget network by emulating real active adversaries. Deep Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) is seen as a promising solution to automating the process of\npenetration tests by reducing human effort and improving reliability. Existing\nRL solutions focus on finding a specific attack path to impact the target\nhosts. However, in reality, a diverse range of attack variations are needed to\nprovide comprehensive assessments of the target network's security level.\nHence, the attack agents must consider multiple objectives when penetrating the\nnetwork. Nevertheless, this challenge is not adequately addressed in the\nexisting literature. To this end, we formulate the automatic penetration\ntesting in the Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) framework and\npropose a Chebyshev decomposition critic to find diverse adversary strategies\nthat balance different objectives in the penetration test. Additionally, the\nnumber of available actions increases with the agent consistently probing the\ntarget network, making the training process intractable in many practical\nsituations. Thus, we introduce a coverage-based masking mechanism that reduces\nattention on previously selected actions to help the agent adapt to future\nexploration. Experimental evaluation on a range of scenarios demonstrates the\nsuperiority of our proposed approach when compared to adapted algorithms in\nterms of multi-objective learning and performance efficiency.",

Safety is\nmathematically encoded using stochastic control barrier functions and safe\ncontrols are computed by solving quadratic programs. Decentralization is\nachieved by augmenting to each agent's optimization variables, copy variables,\nfor its neighbors. This allows us to decouple the centralized multi-agent\noptimization problem. However, to ensure safety, neighboring agents must agree\non \"what is safe for both of us\" and this creates a need for consensus. To\nenable safe consensus solutions, we incorporate an ADMM-based approach.\nSpecifically, we propose a Merged CADMM-OSQP implicit neural network layer,\nthat solves a mini-batch of both, local quadratic programs as well as the\noverall consensus problem, as a single optimization problem.

All the Challenges are based on a\ncommon benchmark database, Aff-Wild2, which is a large scale in-the-wild\ndatabase and the first one to be annotated in terms of valence-arousal,\nexpressions and action units. In this paper, we present the four Challenges,\nwith the utilized Competition corpora, we outline the evaluation metrics and\npresent the baseline systems along with their obtained results.",

    "abstract": "The $K$-armed dueling bandit problem, where the feedback is in the form of\nnoisy pairwise comparisons, has been widely studied. Previous works have only\nfocused on the sequential setting where the policy adapts after every\ncomparison. However, in many applications such as search ranking and\nrecommendation systems, it is preferable to perform comparisons in a limited\nnumber of parallel batches. We study the batched $K$-armed dueling bandit\nproblem under two standard settings: (i) existence of a Condorcet winner, and\n(ii) strong stochastic transitivity and stochastic triangle inequality. For\nboth settings, we obtain algorithms with a smooth trade-off between the number\nof batches and regret. Our regret bounds match the best known sequential regret\nbounds (up to poly-logarithmic factors), using only a logarithmic number of\nbatches. We complement our regret analysis with a nearly-matching lower bound.\nFinally, we also validate our theoretical results via experiments on synthetic\nand real data.",

    "abstract": "Causal inference from observational datasets often relies on measuring and\nadjusting for covariates. In practice, measurements of the covariates can often\nbe noisy and/or biased, or only measurements of their proxies may be available.\nDirectly adjusting for these imperfect measurements of the covariates can lead\nto biased causal estimates. Moreover, without additional assumptions, the\ncausal effects are not point-identifiable due to the noise in these\nmeasurements. To this end, we study the partial identification of causal\neffects given noisy covariates, under a user-specified assumption on the noise\nlevel. The key observation is that we can formulate the identification of the\naverage treatment effects (ATE) as a robust optimization problem. This\nformulation leads to an efficient robust optimization algorithm that bounds the\nATE with noisy covariates. We show that this robust optimization approach can\nextend a wide range of causal adjustment methods to perform partial\nidentification, including backdoor adjustment, inverse propensity score\nweighting, double machine learning, and front door adjustment. Across synthetic\nand real datasets, we find that this approach provides ATE bounds with a higher\ncoverage probability than existing methods.",

    "abstract": "The goal of relation extraction (RE) is to extract the semantic relations\nbetween/among entities in the text. As a fundamental task in natural language\nprocessing, it is crucial to ensure the robustness of RE models. Despite the\nhigh accuracy current deep neural models have achieved in RE tasks, they are\neasily affected by spurious correlations. One solution to this problem is to\ntrain the model with counterfactually augmented data (CAD) such that it can\nlearn the causation rather than the confounding. However, no attempt has been\nmade on generating counterfactuals for RE tasks. In this paper, we formulate\nthe problem of automatically generating CAD for RE tasks from an entity-centric\nviewpoint, and develop a novel approach to derive contextual counterfactuals\nfor entities. Specifically, we exploit two elementary topological properties,\ni.e., the centrality and the shortest path, in syntactic and semantic\ndependency graphs, to first identify and then intervene on the contextual\ncausal features for entities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on four RE\ndatasets by combining our proposed approach with a variety of backbone RE\nmodels. The results demonstrate that our approach not only improves the\nperformance of the backbones, but also makes them more robust in the\nout-of-domain test.",

Yet, with the rapid advances in synthetic media\ntechniques (e.g., deepfake), the security of FLV is facing unprecedented\nchallenges, about which little is known thus far.\nTo bridge this gap, in this paper, we conduct the first systematic study on\nthe security of FLV in real-world settings. Specifically, we present\nLiveBugger, a new deepfake-powered attack framework that enables customizable,\nautomated security evaluation of FLV. Leveraging LiveBugger, we perform a\ncomprehensive empirical assessment of representative FLV platforms, leading to\na set of interesting findings. For instance, most FLV APIs do not use\nanti-deepfake detection; even for those with such defenses, their effectiveness\nis concerning (e.g., it may detect high-quality synthesized videos but fail to\ndetect low-quality ones). We then conduct an in-depth analysis of the factors\nimpacting the attack performance of LiveBugger: a) the bias (e.g., gender or\nrace) in FLV can be exploited to select victims; b) adversarial training makes\ndeepfake more effective to bypass FLV; c) the input quality has a varying\ninfluence on different deepfake techniques to bypass FLV. Based on these\nfindings, we propose a customized, two-stage approach that can boost the attack\nsuccess rate by up to 70%. Further, we run proof-of-concept attacks on several\nrepresentative applications of FLV (i.e., the clients of FLV APIs) to\nillustrate the practical implications: due to the vulnerability of the APIs,\nmany downstream applications are vulnerable to deepfake. Finally, we discuss\npotential countermeasures to improve the security of FLV. Our findings have\nbeen confirmed by the corresponding vendors.",

    "abstract": "In today's economy, it becomes important for Internet platforms to consider\nthe sequential information design problem to align its long term interest with\nincentives of the gig service providers. This paper proposes a novel model of\nsequential information design, namely the Markov persuasion processes (MPPs),\nwhere a sender, with informational advantage, seeks to persuade a stream of\nmyopic receivers to take actions that maximizes the sender's cumulative\nutilities in a finite horizon Markovian environment with varying prior and\nutility functions. Planning in MPPs thus faces the unique challenge in finding\na signaling policy that is simultaneously persuasive to the myopic receivers\nand inducing the optimal long-term cumulative utilities of the sender.\nNevertheless, in the population level where the model is known, it turns out\nthat we can efficiently determine the optimal (resp. $\\epsilon$-optimal) policy\nwith finite (resp. infinite) states and outcomes, through a modified\nformulation of the Bellman equation.\nOur main technical contribution is to study the MPP under the online\nreinforcement learning (RL) setting, where the goal is to learn the optimal\nsignaling policy by interacting with with the underlying MPP, without the\nknowledge of the sender's utility functions, prior distributions, and the\nMarkov transition kernels. We design a provably efficient no-regret learning\nalgorithm, the Optimism-Pessimism Principle for Persuasion Process (OP4), which\nfeatures a novel combination of both optimism and pessimism principles. Our\nalgorithm enjoys sample efficiency by achieving a sublinear $\\sqrt{T}$-regret\nupper bound. Furthermore, both our algorithm and theory can be applied to MPPs\nwith large space of outcomes and states via function approximation, and we\nshowcase such a success under the linear setting.",

A meal delivery platform aims to provide\nexcellent and stable services for customers and restaurants. However, in\nreality, several hundred thousand orders are canceled per day in the Meituan\nmeal delivery platform since they are not accepted by the crowd soucing\ndrivers. The cancellation of the orders is incredibly detrimental to the\ncustomer's repurchase rate and the reputation of the Meituan meal delivery\nplatform. To solve this problem, a certain amount of specific funds is provided\nby Meituan's business managers to encourage the crowdsourcing drivers to accept\nmore orders. To make better use of the funds, in this work, we propose a\nframework to deal with the multi-stage bonus allocation problem for a meal\ndelivery platform. The objective of this framework is to maximize the number of\naccepted orders within a limited bonus budget. This framework consists of a\nsemi-black-box acceptance probability model, a Lagrangian dual-based dynamic\nprogramming algorithm, and an online allocation algorithm. The semi-black-box\nacceptance probability model is employed to forecast the relationship between\nthe bonus allocated to order and its acceptance probability, the Lagrangian\ndual-based dynamic programming algorithm aims to calculate the empirical\nLagrangian multiplier for each allocation stage offline based on the historical\ndata set, and the online allocation algorithm uses the results attained in the\noffline part to calculate a proper delivery bonus for each order. To verify the\neffectiveness and efficiency of our framework, both offline experiments on a\nreal-world data set and online A/B tests on the Meituan meal delivery platform\nare conducted. Our results show that using the proposed framework, the total\norder cancellations can be decreased by more than 25\\% in reality.",

    "title": "Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) with Deep Features -- Patch Classification  Model for Limited Dataset of Breast Tumours",
    "abstract": "Currently, the computational complexity limits the training of high\nresolution gigapixel images using Convolutional Neural Networks. Therefore,\nsuch images are divided into patches or tiles. Since, these high resolution\npatches are encoded with discriminative information therefore; CNNs are trained\non these patches to perform patch-level predictions. However, the problem with\npatch-level prediction is that pathologist generally annotates at image-level\nand not at patch level. Due to this limitation most of the patches may not\ncontain enough class-relevant features. Through this work, we tried to\nincorporate patch descriptive capability within the deep framework by using Bag\nof Visual Words (BoVW) as a kind of regularisation to improve generalizability.\nUsing this hypothesis, we aim to build a patch based classifier to discriminate\nbetween four classes of breast biopsy image patches (normal, benign, \\textit{In\nsitu} carcinoma, invasive carcinoma). The task is to incorporate quality deep\nfeatures using CNN to describe relevant information in the images while\nsimultaneously discarding irrelevant information using Bag of Visual Words\n(BoVW). The proposed method passes patches obtained from WSI and microscopy\nimages through pre-trained CNN to extract features. BoVW is used as a feature\nselector to select most discriminative features among the CNN features.\nFinally, the selected feature sets are classified as one of the four classes.\nThe hybrid model provides flexibility in terms of choice of pre-trained models\nfor feature extraction. The pipeline is end-to-end since it does not require\npost processing of patch predictions to select discriminative patches. We\ncompared our observations with state-of-the-art methods like ResNet50,\nDenseNet169, and InceptionV3 on the BACH-2018 challenge dataset. Our proposed\nmethod shows better performance than all the three methods.",

    "abstract": "Recently, in-bed human pose estimation has attracted the interest of\nresearchers due to its relevance to a wide range of healthcare applications.\nCompared to the general problem of human pose estimation, in-bed pose\nestimation has several inherent challenges, the most prominent being frequent\nand severe occlusions caused by bedding. In this paper we explore the effective\nuse of images from multiple non-visual and privacy-preserving modalities such\nas depth, long-wave infrared (LWIR) and pressure maps for the task of in-bed\npose estimation in two settings. First, we explore the effective fusion of\ninformation from different imaging modalities for better pose estimation.\nSecondly, we propose a framework that can estimate in-bed pose estimation when\nvisible images are unavailable, and demonstrate the applicability of fusion\nmethods to scenarios where only LWIR images are available. We analyze and\ndemonstrate the effect of fusing features from multiple modalities. For this\npurpose, we consider four different techniques: 1) Addition, 2) Concatenation,\n3) Fusion via learned modal weights, and 4) End-to-end fully trainable\napproach; with a state-of-the-art pose estimation model. We also evaluate the\neffect of reconstructing a data-rich modality (i.e., visible modality) from a\nprivacy-preserving modality with data scarcity (i.e., long-wavelength infrared)\nfor in-bed human pose estimation. For reconstruction, we use a conditional\ngenerative adversarial network. We conduct ablative studies across different\ndesign decisions of our framework. This includes selecting features with\ndifferent levels of granularity, using different fusion techniques, and varying\nmodel parameters.

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation of point cloud usually relies on dense annotation that\nis exhausting and costly, so it attracts wide attention to investigate\nsolutions for the weakly supervised scheme with only sparse points annotated.\nExisting works start from the given labels and propagate them to highly-related\nbut unlabeled points, with the guidance of data, e.g. intra-point relation.\nHowever, it suffers from (i) the inefficient exploitation of data information,\nand (ii) the strong reliance on labels thus is easily suppressed when given\nmuch fewer annotations. Therefore, we propose a novel framework, PointMatch,\nthat stands on both data and label, by applying consistency regularization to\nsufficiently probe information from data itself and leveraging weak labels as\nassistance at the same time. By doing so, meaningful information can be learned\nfrom both data and label for better representation learning, which also enables\nthe model more robust to the extent of label sparsity. Simple yet effective,\nthe proposed PointMatch achieves the state-of-the-art performance under various\nweakly-supervised schemes on both ScanNet-v2 and S3DIS datasets, especially on\nthe settings with extremely sparse labels, e.g. surpassing SQN by 21.2% and\n17.2% on the 0.01% and 0.1% setting of ScanNet-v2, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Causal reasoning in relational domains is fundamental to studying real-world\nsocial phenomena in which individual units can influence each other's traits\nand behavior. Dynamics between interconnected units can be represented as an\ninstantiation of a relational causal model; however, causal reasoning over such\ninstantiation requires additional templating assumptions that capture feedback\nloops of influence. Previous research has developed lifted representations to\naddress the relational nature of such dynamics but has strictly required that\nthe representation has no cycles. To facilitate cycles in relational\nrepresentation and learning, we introduce relational $\\sigma$-separation, a new\ncriterion for understanding relational systems with feedback loops. We also\nintroduce a new lifted representation, $\\sigma$-abstract ground graph which\nhelps with abstracting statistical independence relations in all possible\ninstantiations of the cyclic relational model. We show the necessary and\nsufficient conditions for the completeness of $\\sigma$-AGG and that relational\n$\\sigma$-separation is sound and complete in the presence of one or more cycles\nwith arbitrary length.

    "abstract": "Collecting intensive longitudinal thermal preference data from building\noccupants is emerging as an innovative means of characterizing the performance\nof buildings and the people who use them. These techniques have occupants\ngiving subjective feedback using smartphones or smartwatches frequently over\nthe course of days or weeks. The intention is that the data will be collected\nwith high spatial and temporal diversity to best characterize a building and\nthe occupant's preferences. But in reality, leaving the occupant to respond in\nan ad-hoc or fixed interval way creates unneeded survey fatigue and redundant\ndata. This paper outlines a scenario-based (virtual experiment) method for\noptimizing data sampling using a smartwatch to achieve comparable accuracy in a\npersonal thermal preference model with less data. This method uses\nBIM-extracted spatial data, and Graph Neural Network (GNN) based modeling to\nfind regions of similar comfort preference to identify the best scenarios for\ntriggering the occupant to give feedback. This method is compared to two\nbaseline scenarios based on the spatial context of specific spaces and 4 x 4 m\ngrid squares in the building using a theoretical implementation on two\nfield-collected data sets. The results show that the proposed Build2Vec method\nis 18-23% more in the overall sampling quality than the spaces-based and the\nsquare-grid-based sampling methods.

MDA is a challenging task due to\nthe severe domain shift, which not only exists between target and source but\nalso exists among diverse sources. Prior studies on MDA either estimate a mixed\ndistribution of source domains or combine multiple single-source models, but\nfew of them delve into the relevant information among diverse source domains.\nFor this reason, we propose a novel MDA approach, termed Pseudo Target for MDA\n(PTMDA). Specifically, PTMDA maps each group of source and target domains into\na group-specific subspace using adversarial learning with a metric constraint,\nand constructs a series of pseudo target domains correspondingly. Then we align\nthe remainder source domains with the pseudo target domain in the subspace\nefficiently, which allows to exploit additional structured source information\nthrough the training on pseudo target domain and improves the performance on\nthe real target domain. Besides, to improve the transferability of deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs), we replace the traditional batch normalization layer with an\neffective matching normalization layer, which enforces alignments in latent\nlayers of DNNs and thus gains further promotion. We give theoretical analysis\nshowing that PTMDA as a whole can reduce the target error bound and leads to a\nbetter approximation of the target risk in MDA settings.

    "abstract": "Gossip algorithms and their accelerated versions have been studied\nexclusively in discrete time on graphs. In this work, we take a different\napproach, and consider the scaling limit of gossip algorithms in both large\ngraphs and large number of iterations. These limits lead to well-known partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs) with insightful properties. On lattices, we prove\nthat the non-accelerated gossip algorithm of Boyd et al. [2006] converges to\nthe heat equation, and the accelerated Jacobi polynomial iteration of Berthier\net al. [2020] converges to the Euler-Poisson-Darboux (EPD) equation - a damped\nwave equation. Remarkably, with appropriate parameters, the fundamental\nsolution of the EPD equation has the ideal gossip behaviour: a uniform density\nover an ellipsoid, whose radius increases at a rate proportional to t - the\nfastest possible rate for locally communicating gossip algorithms. This is in\ncontrast with the heat equation where the density spreads on a typical scale of\n$\\sqrt{t}$. Additionally, we provide simulations demonstrating that the gossip\nalgorithms are accurately approximated by their limiting PDEs.",

To represent multi-sentence features by pronouns, we imitate the\nreading process of humans by leveraging coreference information when\ndynamically constructing a heterogeneous graph to enhance semantic information.\nSince the pronoun is notoriously ambiguous in the graph, a mention-pronoun\ncoreference resolution is introduced to calculate the affinity between pronouns\nand corresponding mentions, and the noise suppression mechanism is proposed to\nreduce the noise caused by pronouns.

    "abstract": "Systematic generalization is the ability to combine known parts into novel\nmeaning; an important aspect of efficient human learning, but a weakness of\nneural network learning. In this work, we investigate how two well-known\nmodeling principles -- modularity and data augmentation -- affect systematic\ngeneralization of neural networks in grounded language learning. We analyze how\nlarge the vocabulary needs to be to achieve systematic generalization and how\nsimilar the augmented data needs to be to the problem at hand. Our findings\nshow that even in the controlled setting of a synthetic benchmark, achieving\nsystematic generalization remains very difficult. After training on an\naugmented dataset with almost forty times more adverbs than the original\nproblem, a non-modular baseline is not able to systematically generalize to a\nnovel combination of a known verb and adverb. When separating the task into\ncognitive processes like perception and navigation, a modular neural network is\nable to utilize the augmented data and generalize more systematically,\nachieving 70% and 40% exact match increase over state-of-the-art on two gSCAN\ntests that have not previously been improved.

This is a problem known as domain\nadaptation, since models that learned from a sample distribution (or source\ndomain) struggle to maintain their performance on samples extracted from a\ndifferent distribution or target domain. In this work, we address the complex\ncase of deep learning based domain adaptation for mitochondria segmentation\nacross EM datasets from different tissues and species. We present three\nunsupervised domain adaptation strategies to improve mitochondria segmentation\nin the target domain based on (1) state-of-the-art style transfer between\nimages of both domains; (2) self-supervised learning to pre-train a model using\nunlabeled source and target images, and then fine-tune it only with the source\nlabels; and (3) multi-task neural network architectures trained end-to-end with\nboth labeled and unlabeled images. Additionally, we propose a new training\nstopping criterion based on morphological priors obtained exclusively in the\nsource domain. We carried out all possible cross-dataset experiments using\nthree publicly available EM datasets. We evaluated our proposed strategies on\nthe mitochondria semantic labels predicted on the target datasets.

    "abstract": "Cloud-based enterprise resource planning (cloud ERP) systems have existed in\nthe business market for around ten years. Cloud ERP supports enterprises' daily\nactivities by integrating organizational back-end systems in the cloud\nenvironment. One of the critical functions that cloud ERP offers is the\npurchasing application. The purchasing function of cloud ERP enables\nenterprises to streamline all the online purchasing transactions in real-time\nautomatically. Even cloud ERP is deployed quite often these days, organizations\nsomehow still lack the knowledge of it; to be specific, there are many issues\nattached to cloud ERP implementation yet to be solved. Hence, this paper\ncompares four leading cloud ERP platforms in Australia and proposes a hybrid\ncloud ERP framework to process online purchasing transactions. By adopting a\ncase study approach, a purchasing web-based application is designed and\npresented in this paper. In general, the proposed hybrid cloud ERP framework\nand the integrated web-based purchasing application allow user companies to\nprocess online purchasing transactions with short operation time and increased\nbusiness efficiency; in the meantime, the proposed framework also reduces\nsecurity risks attached to the public cloud.",

    "abstract": "Despite perfectly interpolating the training data, deep neural networks\n(DNNs) can often generalize fairly well, in part due to the \"implicit\nregularization\" induced by the learning algorithm. Nonetheless, various forms\nof regularization, such as \"explicit regularization\" (via weight decay), are\noften used to avoid overfitting, especially when the data is corrupted. There\nare several challenges with explicit regularization, most notably unclear\nconvergence properties. Inspired by convergence properties of stochastic mirror\ndescent (SMD) algorithms, we propose a new method for training DNNs with\nregularization, called regularizer mirror descent (RMD). In highly\noverparameterized DNNs, SMD simultaneously interpolates the training data and\nminimizes a certain potential function of the weights. RMD starts with a\nstandard cost which is the sum of the training loss and a convex regularizer of\nthe weights. Reinterpreting this cost as the potential of an \"augmented\"\noverparameterized network and applying SMD yields RMD. As a result, RMD\ninherits the properties of SMD and provably converges to a point \"close\" to the\nminimizer of this cost. RMD is computationally comparable to stochastic\ngradient descent (SGD) and weight decay, and is parallelizable in the same\nmanner. Our experimental results on training sets with various levels of\ncorruption suggest that the generalization performance of RMD is remarkably\nrobust and significantly better than both SGD and weight decay, which\nimplicitly and explicitly regularize the $\\ell_2$ norm of the weights. RMD can\nalso be used to regularize the weights to a desired weight vector, which is\nparticularly relevant for continual learning.",

    "abstract": "Analyzing long time series with RNNs often suffers from infeasible training.\nSegmentation is therefore commonly used in data pre-processing. However, in\nnon-stationary time series, there exists often distribution shift among\ndifferent segments. RNN is easily swamped in the dilemma of fitting bias in\nthese segments due to the lack of global information, leading to poor\ngeneralization, known as Temporal Covariate Shift (TCS) problem, which is only\naddressed by a recently proposed RNN-based model. One of the assumptions in TCS\nis that the distribution of all divided intervals under the same segment are\nidentical. This assumption, however, may not be true on high-frequency time\nseries, such as traffic flow, that also have large stochasticity. Besides,\nmacro information across long periods isn't adequately considered in the latest\nRNN-based methods. To address the above issues, we propose Hyper Attention\nRecurrent Neural Network (HARNN) for the modeling of temporal patterns\ncontaining both micro and macro information. An HARNN consists of a meta layer\nfor parameter generation and an attention-enabled main layer for inference.\nHigh-frequency segments are transformed into low-frequency segments and fed\ninto the meta layers, while the first main layer consumes the same\nhigh-frequency segments as conventional methods. In this way, each\nlow-frequency segment in the meta inputs generates a unique main layer,\nenabling the integration of both macro information and micro information for\ninference. This forces all main layers to predict the same target which fully\nharnesses the common knowledge in varied distributions when capturing temporal\npatterns. Evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrated that our model\noutperforms a couple of RNN-based methods on a federation of key metrics.",

However, this requires either accurately predicting the\nplugin duration to ensure the EV is charged before it is plugged out or\ninfluencing the driver behaviour to ensure the that a vehicle remains connected\nuntil the EV is charged. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that uses\nreinforcement learning for EV charging and requires neither coordination with\nthe grid nor predicting the session duration.

The results also\nreveal two interesting features: Firstly, our approach is able to spread the\ncharging power in time without knowing the session duration.

Existing models on the scene graph generation task\nnotoriously require tens or hundreds of labeled samples. By contrast, human\nbeings can learn visual relationships from a few or even one example. Inspired\nby this, we design a task named One-Shot Scene Graph Generation, where each\nrelationship triplet (e.g., \"dog-has-head\") comes from only one labeled\nexample. The key insight is that rather than learning from scratch, one can\nutilize rich prior knowledge. In this paper, we propose Multiple Structured\nKnowledge (Relational Knowledge and Commonsense Knowledge) for the one-shot\nscene graph generation task. Specifically, the Relational Knowledge represents\nthe prior knowledge of relationships between entities extracted from the visual\ncontent, e.g., the visual relationships \"standing in\", \"sitting in\", and \"lying\nin\" may exist between \"dog\" and \"yard\", while the Commonsense Knowledge encodes\n\"sense-making\" knowledge like \"dog can guard yard\". By organizing these two\nkinds of knowledge in a graph structure, Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) are\nused to extract knowledge-embedded semantic features of the entities. Besides,\ninstead of extracting isolated visual features from each entity generated by\nFaster R-CNN, we utilize an Instance Relation Transformer encoder to fully\nexplore their context information.

    "abstract": "Scene graph generation (SGG) is built on top of detected objects to predict\nobject pairwise visual relations for describing the image content abstraction.\nExisting works have revealed that if the links between objects are given as\nprior knowledge, the performance of SGG is significantly improved. Inspired by\nthis observation, in this article, we propose a relation regularized network\n(R2-Net), which can predict whether there is a relationship between two objects\nand encode this relation into object feature refinement and better SGG.\nSpecifically, we first construct an affinity matrix among detected objects to\nrepresent the probability of a relationship between two objects. Graph\nconvolution networks (GCNs) over this relation affinity matrix are then used as\nobject encoders, producing relation-regularized representations of objects.\nWith these relation-regularized features, our R2-Net can effectively refine\nobject labels and generate scene graphs. Extensive experiments are conducted on\nthe visual genome dataset for three SGG tasks (i.e., predicate classification,\nscene graph classification, and scene graph detection), demonstrating the\neffectiveness of our proposed method. Ablation studies also verify the key\nroles of our proposed components in performance improvement.",

    "abstract": "Automatically describing videos with natural language is a fundamental\nchallenge for computer vision and natural language processing. Recently,\nprogress in this problem has been achieved through two steps: 1) employing 2-D\nand/or 3-D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (e.g. VGG, ResNet or C3D) to\nextract spatial and/or temporal features to encode video contents; and 2)\napplying Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to generate sentences to describe\nevents in videos. Temporal attention-based model has gained much progress by\nconsidering the importance of each video frame. However, for a long video,\nespecially for a video which consists of a set of sub-events, we should\ndiscover and leverage the importance of each sub-shot instead of each frame. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel approach, namely temporal and spatial LSTM\n(TS-LSTM), which systematically exploits spatial and temporal dynamics within\nvideo sequences. In TS-LSTM, a temporal pooling LSTM (TP-LSTM) is designed to\nincorporate both spatial and temporal information to extract long-term temporal\ndynamics within video sub-shots; and a stacked LSTM is introduced to generate a\nlist of words to describe the video. Experimental results obtained in two\npublic video captioning benchmarks indicate that our TS-LSTM outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

A promising approach is to leverage time obtained over\nnetworks a mobile device can connect to, and detect discrepancies between the\nGNSS-provided time and the network time. The challenge lies in having reliably\nboth accurate and trustworthy network time as the basis for the GNSS attack\ndetection. Here, we provide a concrete proposal that leverages, together with\nthe network time servers, the nearly ubiquitous IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi)\ninfrastructure. Our framework supports application-layer, secure and robust\nreal time broadcasting by Wi-Fi Access Points (APs), based on hash chains and\ninfrequent digital signatures verification to minimize computational and\ncommunication overhead, allowing mobile nodes to efficiently obtain\nauthenticated and rich time information as they roam. We pair this method with\nNetwork Time Security (NTS), for enhanced resilience through multiple sources,\navailable, ideally, simultaneously. We analyze the performance of our scheme in\na dedicated setup, gauging the overhead for authenticated time data (Wi-Fi\ntimestamped beacons and NTS). The results show that it is possible to provide\nsecurity for the external to GNSS time sources, with minimal overhead for\nauthentication and integrity, even when the GNSS-equipped nodes are mobile, and\nthus have short interactions with the Wi-Fi infrastructure and possibly\nintermittent Internet connectivity, as well as limited resources.",

A proof-of-concept design\nof a crawling robot for pipe inspection and preliminary analysis of its\nlocomotion capabilities are presented in this work. The novelty of the proposed\ndesign is the combination of silicone based elements of different stiffness to\nenable global shape reconfiguration and whole-body track-based locomotion. The\nproposed system makes use of a plurality of multi-materials elastic tracks\nactuated by an on-board motor through a worm gear that pairs with all of them,\ncausing their constant eversion from the inside to the outside of the chassis\nof the robot. Two toroidal inflatable chambers surround the chassis of the\nrobot while passing through the loops created by the tracks. Upon inflation of\nthe chambers the tracks are deformed, changing the overall diameter of the\nsystem. This feature allows the system to adjust to the local diameter of the\npipe navigated, enabling also active contact force control between the tracks\nand the pipe walls. We demonstrate how the proposed system efficiently moves\nthrough rigid pipes of different diameters, both straight and curved,\nincrementing its outer diameter up to 100% of his original size. Maximum\nnavigation speed and stall force applied are evaluated. With two front cameras\nembedded, the proposed robotic system can represent a cost-effective and\neasy-to-control solution for inspection applications, when adaptability and\ncompliance are critical requirements.",

    "abstract": "Utilizing pre-trained language models has achieved great success for neural\ndocument ranking. Limited by the computational and memory requirements, long\ndocument modeling becomes a critical issue. Recent works propose to modify the\nfull attention matrix in Transformer by designing sparse attention patterns.\nHowever, most of them only focus on local connections of terms within a\nfixed-size window. How to build suitable remote connections between terms to\nbetter model document representation remains underexplored. In this paper, we\npropose the model Socialformer, which introduces the characteristics of social\nnetworks into designing sparse attention patterns for long document modeling in\ndocument ranking. Specifically, we consider several attention patterns to\nconstruct a graph like social networks. Endowed with the characteristic of\nsocial networks, most pairs of nodes in such a graph can reach with a short\npath while ensuring the sparsity. To facilitate efficient calculation, we\nsegment the graph into multiple subgraphs to simulate friend circles in social\nscenarios. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our model on long\ndocument modeling.",

    "abstract": "Fuzzy rough set theory can be used as a tool for dealing with inconsistent\ndata when there is a gradual notion of indiscernibility between objects. It\ndoes this by providing lower and upper approximations of concepts. In classical\nfuzzy rough sets, the lower and upper approximations are determined using the\nminimum and maximum operators, respectively. This is undesirable for machine\nlearning applications, since it makes these approximations sensitive to\noutlying samples. To mitigate this problem, ordered weighted average (OWA)\nbased fuzzy rough sets were introduced. In this paper, we show how the\nOWA-based approach can be interpreted intuitively in terms of vague\nquantification, and then generalize it to Choquet-based fuzzy rough sets\n(CFRS). This generalization maintains desirable theoretical properties, such as\nduality and monotonicity. Furthermore, it provides more flexibility for machine\nlearning applications. In particular, we show that it enables the seamless\nintegration of outlier detection algorithms, to enhance the robustness of\nmachine learning algorithms based on fuzzy rough sets.",

In AMOT,\neach camera only receives partial information from its observation, which may\nmislead cameras to take locally optimal action. Besides, the global goal, i.e.,\nmaximum coverage of objects, is hard to be directly optimized. To address the\nabove issues, we propose a coordinate-aligned multi-camera collaboration system\nfor AMOT. In our approach, we regard each camera as an agent and address AMOT\nwith a multi-agent reinforcement learning solution. To represent the\nobservation of each agent, we first identify the targets in the camera view\nwith an image detector, and then align the coordinates of the targets in 3D\nenvironment. We define the reward of each agent based on both global coverage\nas well as four individual reward terms. The action policy of the agents is\nderived with a value-based Q-network. To the best of our knowledge, we are the\nfirst to study the AMOT task. To train and evaluate the efficacy of our system,\nwe build a virtual yet credible 3D environment, named \"Soccer Court\", to mimic\nthe real-world AMOT scenario.

Therefore, it is possible to\nrank and categorize papers based on their sentiment and intent. For this\npurpose, larger citation sentiment datasets are required. However, from a time\nand cost perspective, curating a large citation sentiment dataset is a\nchallenging task. Particularly, citation sentiment analysis suffers from both\ndata scarcity and tremendous costs for dataset annotation. To overcome the\nbottleneck of data scarcity in the citation analysis domain we explore the\nimpact of out-domain data during training to enhance the model performance. Our\nresults emphasize the use of different scheduling methods based on the use\ncase. We empirically found that a model trained using sequential data\nscheduling is more suitable for domain-specific usecases.

Existing audio-visual navigation works assume a clean environment\nthat solely contains the target sound, which, however, would not be suitable in\nmost real-world applications due to the unexpected sound noise or intentional\ninterference. In this work, we design an acoustically complex environment in\nwhich, besides the target sound, there exists a sound attacker playing a\nzero-sum game with the agent.

These kinds of simulations are\nrequired for e.g., the numerical investigation of wear mechanisms at small\nlength scales, which is still a challenging task in engineering. The basic idea\nof the proposed algorithm is to combine the advantages of the Finite Cell\nMethod allowing for a convenient integration of heterogeneous finite element\nproblems with the eigenerosion approach to still enable the mesh-independent\nsimulation of crack propagation. The major component is to switch from finite\nsubcells to finite elements wherever the crack progresses, thereby\nautomatically adaptively refining at the crack tip by managing the newly\nappearing nodes as hanging nodes. Technically relevant problems of crack\npropagation at the microscale are mostly linked with sub-critical crack growth\nwhere the crack moves fast and stepwise with subsequent load cycles. Therefore,\ninertia may become important which is why dynamics are taken into account by\nspreading the mass of the eroded elements to the nodes to avoid a loss in mass\nresulting from the erosion procedure. Furthermore, a certain treatment for the\nfinite cell decomposition is considered in order to ensure efficiency and\naccuracy.

Further, older adults' crisis technology preferences were\nlinked to their sense of control, social relationships, and digital readiness.\nWe discuss how a focus on community resilience can yield crisis technologies\nthat more effectively support older adults.",

In this work, we provide an optimal rate convergence analysis and error\nestimate for finite difference schemes based on the Slotboom reformulation.\nDifferent options of mobility average at the staggered mesh points are\nconsidered in the finite-difference spatial discretization, such as the\nharmonic mean, geometric mean, arithmetic mean, and entropic mean. A\nsemi-implicit temporal discretization is applied, which in turn results in a\nnon-constant coefficient, positive-definite linear system at each time step. A\nhigher order asymptotic expansion is applied in the consistency analysis, and\nsuch a higher order consistency estimate is necessary to control the discrete\nmaximum norm of the concentration variables. In convergence estimate, the\nharmonic mean for the mobility average, which turns out to bring lots of\nconvenience in the theoretical analysis, is taken for simplicity, while other\noptions of mobility average would also lead to the desired error estimate, with\nmore technical details involved. As a result, an optimal rate convergence\nanalysis on concentrations, electric potential, and ionic fluxes is derived,\nwhich is the first such results for the structure-preserving numerical schemes\nbased on the Slotboom reformulation. It is remarked that the convergence\nanalysis leads to a theoretical justification of the conditional energy\ndissipation analysis, which relies on the maximum norm bounds of the\nconcentration and the gradient of the electric potential. Some numerical\nresults are also presented to demonstrate the accuracy and structure-preserving\nperformance of the associated schemes.",

It is challenging to implement on-device training on\nresource-limited FPGAs due to the low efficiency caused by different memory\naccess patterns among forward, backward propagation, and weight update.\nTherefore, we developed a data reshaping approach with intra-tile continuous\nmemory allocation and weight reuse.

However, future pick-up requests vary significantly\nwith time. While the assignment results are generally static without changing\nwith time. Using the historical pick-up request number to conduct AOI\nassignment (or pick-up request assignment) for couriers is thus unreasonable.\nMoreover, even we can first predict future pick-up requests and then use the\nprediction results to conduct the assignments, this kind of two-stage method is\nalso impractical and trivial, and exists some drawbacks, such as the best\nprediction results might not ensure the best clustering results. To solve these\nproblems, we put forward an intelligent end-to-end predict-then-optimize\nclustering method to simultaneously predict the future pick-up requests of AOIs\nand assign AOIs to couriers by clustering. At first, we propose a deep\nlearning-based prediction model to predict order numbers on AOIs.

We finally propose a one-stage end-to-end\npredict-then-optimize clustering method to assign AOIs to couriers reasonably,\ndynamically, and intelligently.

Previous work focused on designing\nalgorithms when forecasts are available, which are not robust to inaccuracies\nin the forecast, or online algorithms with worst-case performance guarantees,\nwhich can be too conservative in practice. In this work, we look at the\nsingle-leg revenue management problem through the lens of the\nalgorithms-with-advice framework, which attempts to optimally incorporate\nadvice/predictions about the future into online algorithms. In particular, we\ncharacterize the Pareto frontier that captures the tradeoff between consistency\n(performance when advice is accurate) and competitiveness (performance when\nadvice is inaccurate) for every advice. Moreover, we provide an online\nalgorithm that always achieves performance on this Pareto frontier. We also\nstudy the class of protection level policies, which is the most widely-deployed\ntechnique for single-leg revenue management: we provide an algorithm to\nincorporate advice into protection levels that optimally trades off consistency\nand competitiveness. Moreover, we empirically evaluate the performance of these\nalgorithms on synthetic data.

    "abstract": "How are abstract concepts and musical themes recognized on the basis of some\nprevious experience? It is interesting to compare the different behaviors of\nhuman and of artificial intelligences with respect to this problem. Generally,\na human mind that abstracts a concept (say, table) from a given set of known\nexamples creates a table-Gestalt: a kind of vague and out of focus image that\ndoes not fully correspond to a particular table with well determined features.\nA similar situation arises in the case of musical themes. Can the construction\nof a gestaltic pattern, which is so natural for human minds, be taught to an\nintelligent machine? This problem can be successfully discussed in the\nframework of a quantum approach to pattern recognition and to machine learning.\nThe basic idea is replacing classical data sets with quantum data sets, where\neither objects or musical themes can be formally represented as pieces of\nquantum information, involving the uncertainties and the ambiguities that\ncharacterize the quantum world. In this framework, the intuitive concept of\nGestalt can be simulated by the mathematical concept of positive centroid of a\ngiven quantum data set. Accordingly, the crucial problem \"how can we classify a\nnew object or a new musical theme (we have listened to) on the basis of a\nprevious experience?\" can be dealt with in terms of some special quantum\nsimilarity-relations. Although recognition procedures are different for human\nand for artificial intelligences, there is a common method of \"facing the\nproblems\" that seems to work in both cases.",

This is in contrast to the well-studied setting in which\nsamples of the customer's valuation (willingness to pay) are observed. In our\nsetting, the observed data is influenced by the historic pricing policy, and we\ndo not know how customers would have responded to alternative prices. We\nintroduce suitable loss functions for this pricing setting which can be\ndirectly optimized to find an effective pricing policy with expected revenue\nguarantees without the need for estimation of an intermediate demand function.\nWe focus on convex loss functions. This is particularly relevant when linear\npricing policies are desired for interpretability reasons, resulting in a\ntractable convex revenue optimization problem. We further propose generalized\nhinge and quantile pricing loss functions, which price at a multiplicative\nfactor of the conditional expected value or a particular quantile of the\nvaluation distribution when optimized, despite the valuation data not being\nobserved. We prove expected revenue bounds for these pricing policies\nrespectively when the valuation distribution is log-concave, and provide\ngeneralization bounds for the finite sample case.

MISELBO is\napplicable in both amortized and classical VI, and it uses ensembles, e.g.,\ndeep ensembles, of independently inferred variational approximations. As far as\nwe are aware, the concept of deep ensembles in amortized VI has not previously\nbeen established. We prove that MISELBO provides a tighter bound than the\naverage of standard ELBOs, and demonstrate empirically that it gives tighter\nbounds than the average of IWELBOs. MISELBO is evaluated in density-estimation\nexperiments that include MNIST and several real-data phylogenetic tree\ninference problems. First, on the MNIST dataset, MISELBO boosts the\ndensity-estimation performances of a state-of-the-art model, nouveau VAE.\nSecond, in the phylogenetic tree inference setting, our framework enhances a\nstate-of-the-art VI algorithm that uses normalizing flows. On top of the\ntechnical benefits of MISELBO, it allows to unveil connections between VI and\nrecent advances in the importance sampling literature, paving the way for\nfurther methodological advances.

    "abstract": "In the context of 6th generation (6G) networks, vehicular edge computing\n(VEC) is emerging as a promising solution to let battery-powered ground\nvehicles with limited computing and storage resources offload processing tasks\nto more powerful devices. Given the dynamic vehicular environment, VEC systems\nneed to be as flexible, intelligent, and adaptive as possible. To this aim, in\nthis paper we study the opportunity to realize VEC via non-terrestrial networks\n(NTNs), where ground vehicles offload resource-hungry tasks to Unmanned Aerial\nVehicles (UAVs), High Altitude Platforms (HAPs), or a combination of the two.\nWe define an optimization problem in which tasks are modeled as a Poisson\narrival process, and apply queuing theory to find the optimal offloading factor\nin the system. Numerical results show that aerial-assisted VEC is feasible even\nin dense networks, provided that high-capacity HAP/UAV platforms are available.",

    "abstract": "As a main use case of 5G and Beyond wireless network, the ever-increasing\nmachine type communications (MTC) devices pose critical challenges over MTC\nnetwork in recent years. It is imperative to support massive MTC devices with\nlimited resources. To this end, Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based\nrandom access network has been deemed as a prospective candidate for MTC\nnetwork. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (RL) based\napproach for NOMA-based random access network with truncated channel inversion\npower control. Specifically, each MTC device randomly selects a pre-defined\npower level with a certain probability for data transmission. Devices are using\nchannel inversion power control yet subject to the upper bound of the\ntransmission power. Due to the stochastic feature of the channel fading and the\nlimited transmission power, devices with different achievable power levels have\nbeen categorized as different types of devices. In order to achieve high\nthroughput with considering the fairness between all devices, two objective\nfunctions are formulated. One is to maximize the minimum long-term expected\nthroughput of all MTC devices, the other is to maximize the geometric mean of\nthe long-term expected throughput for all MTC devices. A Policy based deep\nreinforcement learning approach is further applied to tune the transmission\nprobabilities of each device to solve the formulated optimization problems.\nExtensive simulations are conducted to show the merits of our proposed\napproach.",

    "abstract": "We study hidden-action principal-agent problems in which a principal commits\nto an outcome-dependent payment scheme (called contract) so as to incentivize\nthe agent to take a costly, unobservable action leading to favorable outcomes.\nIn particular, we focus on Bayesian settings where the agent has private\ninformation. This is collectively encoded by the agent's type, which is unknown\nto the principal, but randomly drawn according to a finitely-supported,\ncommonly-known probability distribution. The agent's type determines both the\nprobability distribution over outcomes and the cost associated with each\nagent's action. In Bayesian principal-agent problems, the principal may be\nbetter off by committing to a menu of contracts specifying a contract for each\nagent's type, rater than committing to a single contract. This induces a\ntwo-stage process that resembles interactions studied in mechanism design:\nafter the principal has committed to a menu, the agent first reports a type to\nthe principal, and, then, the latter puts in place the contract in the menu\nthat corresponds to the reported type. Thus, the principal's computational\nproblem boils down to designing a menu of contracts that incentivizes the agent\nto report their true type and maximizes expected utility. Previous works showed\nthat computing an optimal menu of contracts or an optimal (single) contract is\nAPX-hard, which is in sharp contrast from what happens in non-Bayesian\nsettings, where an optimal contract can be computed efficiently. Crucially,\nprevious works focus on menus of deterministic contracts. Surprisingly, in this\npaper we show that, if one considers menus of randomized contracts, then an\noptimal menu can be computed in polynomial time. Besides this main result, we\nalso close several gaps in the computational complexity analysis of the problem\nof computing menus of deterministic contracts.",

In these\nmodels, during fine-tuning, the encoder transforms sentences to context vectors\nin the latent space and the decoder learns the summary generation task based on\nthe context vectors. In our approach, we consider two clusters of salient and\nnon-salient context vectors, using which the decoder can attend more to salient\ncontext vectors for summary generation. For this, we propose a novel clustering\ntransformer layer between the encoder and the decoder, which first generates\ntwo clusters of salient and non-salient vectors, and then normalizes and\nshrinks the clusters to make them apart in the latent space. Our experimental\nresult shows that the proposed model outperforms the existing BART model by\nlearning these distinct cluster patterns, improving up to 4% in ROUGE and 0.3%\nin BERTScore on average in CNN/DailyMail and XSUM data sets.",

    "title": "Forgiving Debt in Financial Network Games",
    "abstract": "A financial system is represented by a network, where nodes correspond to\nbanks, and directed labeled edges correspond to debt contracts between banks.\nOnce a payment schedule has been defined, where we assume that a bank cannot\nrefuse a payment towards one of its lenders if it has sufficient funds, the\nliquidity of the system is defined as the sum of total payments made in the\nnetwork. Maximizing systemic liquidity is a natural objective of any financial\nauthority, so, we study the setting where the financial authority offers\nbailout money to some bank(s) or forgives the debts of others in order to\nmaximize liquidity, and examine efficient ways to achieve this. We investigate\nthe approximation ratio provided by the greedy bailout policy compared to the\noptimal one, and we study the computational hardness of finding the optimal\ndebt-removal and budget-constrained optimal bailout policy, respectively.\nWe also study financial systems from a game-theoretic standpoint. We observe\nthat the removal of some incoming debt might be in the best interest of a bank,\nif that helps one of its borrowers remain solvent and avoid costs related to\ndefault. Assuming that a bank's well-being (i.e., utility) is aligned with the\nincoming payments they receive from the network, we define and analyze a game\namong banks who want to maximize their utility by strategically giving up some\nincoming payments. In addition, we extend the previous game by considering\nbailout payments. After formally defining the above games, we prove results\nabout the existence and quality of pure Nash equilibria, as well as the\ncomputational complexity of finding such equilibria.",

    "abstract": "Reliably and physically accurately transferring information between images\nthrough deformable image registration with large anatomical differences is an\nopen challenge in medical image analysis. Most existing methods have two key\nshortcomings: first, they require extensive up-front parameter tuning to each\nspecific registration problem, and second, they have difficulty capturing large\ndeformations and content mismatches between images. There have however been\ndevelopments that have laid the foundation for potential solutions to both\nshortcomings. Towards the first shortcoming, a multi-objective optimization\napproach using the Real-Valued Gene-pool Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm\n(RV-GOMEA) has been shown to be capable of producing a diverse set of\nregistrations for 2D images in one run of the algorithm, representing different\ntrade-offs between conflicting objectives in the registration problem. This\nallows the user to select a registration afterwards and removes the need for\nup-front tuning. Towards the second shortcoming, a dual-dynamic grid\ntransformation model has proven effective at capturing large differences in 2D\nimages. These two developments have recently been accelerated through GPU\nparallelization, delivering large speed-ups. Based on this accelerated version,\nit is now possible to extend the approach to 3D images. Concordantly, this work\nintroduces the first method for multi-objective 3D deformable image\nregistration, using a 3D dual-dynamic grid transformation model based on\nsimplex meshes while still supporting the incorporation of annotated guidance\ninformation and multi-resolution schemes. Our proof-of-concept prototype shows\npromising results on synthetic and clinical 3D registration problems, forming\nthe foundation for a new, insightful method that can include bio-mechanical\nproperties in the registration.",

Many state-of-the-art approaches\nto SLR focus on the classification of static hand gestures, but communication\nis a temporal activity, which is reflected by many of the dynamic gestures\npresent. Given this, temporal information during the delivery of a gesture is\nnot often considered within SLR. The experiments in this work consider the\nproblem of SL gesture recognition regarding how dynamic gestures change during\ntheir delivery, and this study aims to explore how single types of features as\nwell as mixed features affect the classification ability of a machine learning\nmodel. 18 common gestures recorded via a Leap Motion Controller sensor provide\na complex classification problem. Two sets of features are extracted from a 0.6\nsecond time window, statistical descriptors and spatio-temporal attributes.\nFeatures from each set are compared by their ANOVA F-Scores and p-values,\narranged into bins grown by 10 features per step to a limit of the 250\nhighest-ranked features. Results show that the best statistical model selected\n240 features and scored 85.96% accuracy, the best spatio-temporal model\nselected 230 features and scored 80.98%, and the best mixed-feature model\nselected 240 features from each set leading to a classification accuracy of\n86.75%. When all three sets of results are compared (146 individual machine\nlearning models), the overall distribution shows that the minimum results are\nincreased when inputs are any number of mixed features compared to any number\nof either of the two single sets of features.",

Accompanying these\nstaged leaps is the evaluation research and development of MT, especially the\nimportant role of evaluation methods in statistical translation and neural\ntranslation research. The evaluation task of MT is not only to evaluate the\nquality of machine translation, but also to give timely feedback to machine\ntranslation researchers on the problems existing in machine translation itself,\nhow to improve and how to optimise. In some practical application fields, such\nas in the absence of reference translations, the quality estimation of machine\ntranslation plays an important role as an indicator to reveal the credibility\nof automatically translated target languages. This report mainly includes the\nfollowing contents: a brief history of machine translation evaluation (MTE),\nthe classification of research methods on MTE, and the the cutting-edge\nprogress, including human evaluation, automatic evaluation, and evaluation of\nevaluation methods (meta-evaluation).

Our\nmain result is a randomized method satisfying quota, ex ante proportionality\nand house monotonicity - a property that prevents paradoxes when the number of\nseats changes and which we require to hold ex post. This result is based on a\ngeneralization of dependent rounding on bipartite graphs, which we call\ncumulative rounding and which might be of independent interest, as we\ndemonstrate via applications beyond apportionment.",

Dealing with\nsuch a policy space is a hefty challenge, which often causes sample and\ncomputation inefficiencies. However, we argue that a limited number of policies\nare actually relevant when we also account for the structure of the environment\nand of the policy parameterization, as many of them would induce very similar\ninteractions, i.e., state-action distributions. In this paper, we seek for a\nreward-free compression of the policy space into a finite set of representative\npolicies, such that, given any policy $\\pi$, the minimum R\\'enyi divergence\nbetween the state-action distributions of the representative policies and the\nstate-action distribution of $\\pi$ is bounded.

    "abstract": "Long Range (LoRa) is the most widely used technology for enabling Low Power\nWide Area Networks (LPWANs) on unlicensed frequency bands. Despite its modest\nData Rates (DRs), it provides extensive coverage for low-power devices, making\nit an ideal communication system for many Internet of Things (IoT)\napplications. In general, LoRa radio is considered as the physical layer,\nwhereas Long Range Wide Area Networks (LoRaWAN) is the MAC layer of the LoRa\nstack that adopts star topology to enable communication between multiple End\nDevices (EDs) and the network Gateway (GW). The Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS)\nmodulation deals with LoRa signals interference and ensures long-range\ncommunication. At the same time, the Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) mechanism allows\nEDs to dynamically alter some LoRa features such as the Spreading Factor (SF),\nCode Rate (CR), and carrier frequency to address the time variance of\ncommunication conditions in dense networks. Despite the high LoRa connectivity\ndemand, LoRa signals interference and concurrent transmission collisions are\nmajor limitations. Therefore, to enhance LoRaWAN capacity, the LoRa alliance\nreleased many LoRaWAN versions, and the research community provided numerous\nsolutions to develop scalable LoRaWAN technology. Hence, we thoroughly examined\nLoRaWAN scalability challenges and the state-of-the-art solutions in both the\nPHY and MAC layers. Most of these solutions rely on SF, logical, and frequency\nchannel assignment, while others propose new network topologies or implement\nsignal processing schemes to cancel the interference and allow LoRaWAN to\nconnect more EDs efficiently. A summary of the existing solutions in the\nliterature is provided at the end of the paper by describing the advantages and\ndrawbacks of each solution and suggesting possible enhancements as future\nresearch directions.",

Two\ncommonly desired properties for learned prediction sets are \\emph{valid\ncoverage} and \\emph{good efficiency} (such as low length or low cardinality).\nConformal prediction is a powerful technique for learning prediction sets with\nvalid coverage, yet by default its conformalization step only learns a single\nparameter, and does not optimize the efficiency over more expressive function\nclasses.\nIn this paper, we propose a generalization of conformal prediction to\nmultiple learnable parameters, by considering the constrained empirical risk\nminimization (ERM) problem of finding the most efficient prediction set subject\nto valid empirical coverage. This meta-algorithm generalizes existing conformal\nprediction algorithms, and we show that it achieves approximate valid\npopulation coverage and near-optimal efficiency within class, whenever the\nfunction class in the conformalization step is low-capacity in a certain sense.\nNext, this ERM problem is challenging to optimize as it involves a\nnon-differentiable coverage constraint. We develop a gradient-based algorithm\nfor it by approximating the original constrained ERM using differentiable\nsurrogate losses and Lagrangians.

    "abstract": "Grouping and recognition are important components of visual scene\nunderstanding, e.g., for object detection and semantic segmentation. With\nend-to-end deep learning systems, grouping of image regions usually happens\nimplicitly via top-down supervision from pixel-level recognition labels.\nInstead, in this paper, we propose to bring back the grouping mechanism into\ndeep networks, which allows semantic segments to emerge automatically with only\ntext supervision. We propose a hierarchical Grouping Vision Transformer\n(GroupViT), which goes beyond the regular grid structure representation and\nlearns to group image regions into progressively larger arbitrary-shaped\nsegments. We train GroupViT jointly with a text encoder on a large-scale\nimage-text dataset via contrastive losses. With only text supervision and\nwithout any pixel-level annotations, GroupViT learns to group together semantic\nregions and successfully transfers to the task of semantic segmentation in a\nzero-shot manner, i.e., without any further fine-tuning. It achieves a\nzero-shot accuracy of 51.2% mIoU on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and 22.3% mIoU on\nPASCAL Context datasets, and performs competitively to state-of-the-art\ntransfer-learning methods requiring greater levels of supervision.

    "title": "Graph Coloring and Semidefinite Rank",
    "abstract": "This paper considers the interplay between semidefinite programming, matrix\nrank, and graph coloring. Karger, Motwani, and Sudan \\cite{KMS98} give a vector\nprogram for which a coloring of the graph can be encoded as a semidefinite\nmatrix of low rank. By complementary slackness conditions of semidefinite\nprogramming, if an optimal dual solution has sufficiently high rank, any\noptimal primal solution must have low rank. We attempt to characterize graphs\nfor which we can show that the corresponding dual optimal solution must have\nsufficiently high rank. In the case of the original Karger, Motwani, and Sudan\nvector program, we show that any graph which is a $k$-tree has sufficiently\nhigh dual rank, and we can extract the coloring from the corresponding low-rank\nprimal solution. We can also show that if the graph is not uniquely colorable,\nthen no sufficiently high rank dual optimal solution can exist. This allows us\nto completely characterize the planar graphs for which dual optimal solutions\nhave sufficiently high dual rank. We then modify the semidefinite program to\nhave an objective function with costs, and explore when we can create a cost\nfunction whose optimal dual solution has sufficiently high rank. We show that\nit is always possible to construct such a cost function given the graph\ncoloring. The construction of the cost function gives rise to a heuristic for\ngraph coloring which we show works well in the case of planar graphs. Our\nresearch was motivated by the Colin de Verdi\\`ere graph invariant\n\\cite{CDV90}(and a corresponding conjecture of Colin de Verdi\\`ere), in which\nmatrices that have some similarities to the dual feasible matrices must have\nhigh rank in the case that graphs are of a certain type. We explore the\nconnection between the conjecture and the rank of the dual solutions.",

Recently, many convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) have been proposed for various LF image processing tasks.\nHowever, it is challenging for CNNs to effectively process LF images since the\nspatial and angular information are highly inter-twined with varying\ndisparities. In this paper, we propose a generic mechanism to disentangle these\ncoupled information for LF image processing.

Our disentangling mechanism can well incorporate the LF\nstructure prior and effectively handle 4D LF data.

In this dissertation, we develop techniques for\nbroadening the applicability of Gaussian processes. This is done in two ways.\nFirstly, we develop pathwise conditioning techniques for Gaussian processes,\nwhich allow one to express posterior random functions as prior random functions\nplus a dependent update term. We introduce a wide class of efficient\napproximations built from this viewpoint, which can be randomly sampled once in\nadvance, and evaluated at arbitrary locations without any subsequent\nstochasticity. This key property improves efficiency and makes it simpler to\ndeploy Gaussian process models in decision-making settings. Secondly, we\ndevelop a collection of Gaussian process models over non-Euclidean spaces,\nincluding Riemannian manifolds and graphs. We derive fully constructive\nexpressions for the covariance kernels of scalar-valued Gaussian processes on\nRiemannian manifolds and graphs. Building on these ideas, we describe a\nformalism for defining vector-valued Gaussian processes on Riemannian\nmanifolds. The introduced techniques allow all of these models to be trained\nusing standard computational methods. In total, these contributions make\nGaussian processes easier to work with and allow them to be used within a wider\nclass of domains in an effective and principled manner.

However, this kind of annotation which is generally\nrequired for semantic or instance segmentation is time consuming and tedious.\nIn this proposed work, therefore, we have tried to imitate pathologist like\nannotation by segmenting tumour extents by polygonal boundaries. For polygon\nlike annotation or segmentation, we have used Active Contours whose vertices or\nsnake points move towards the boundary of the object of interest to find the\nregion of minimum energy. To penalize the Active Contour we used modified U-Net\narchitecture for learning penalization values. The proposed hybrid deep\nlearning model fuses the modern deep learning segmentation algorithm with\ntraditional Active Contours segmentation technique. The model is tested against\nboth state-of-the-art semantic segmentation and hybrid models for performance\nevaluation against contemporary work. The results obtained show that the\npathologist like annotation could be achieved by developing such hybrid models\nthat integrate the domain knowledge through classical segmentation methods like\nActive Contours and global knowledge through semantic segmentation deep\nlearning models.",

    "abstract": "Differential privacy has been an exceptionally successful concept when it\ncomes to providing provable security guarantees for classical computations.\nMore recently, the concept was generalized to quantum computations. While\nclassical computations are essentially noiseless and differential privacy is\noften achieved by artificially adding noise, near-term quantum computers are\ninherently noisy and it was observed that this leads to natural differential\nprivacy as a feature. In this work we discuss quantum differential privacy in\nan information theoretic framework by casting it as a quantum divergence. A\nmain advantage of this approach is that differential privacy becomes a property\nsolely based on the output states of the computation, without the need to check\nit for every measurement. This leads to simpler proofs and generalized\nstatements of its properties as well as several new bounds for both, general\nand specific, noise models. In particular, these include common representations\nof quantum circuits and quantum machine learning concepts. Here, we focus on\nthe difference in the amount of noise required to achieve certain levels of\ndifferential privacy versus the amount that would make any computation useless.\nFinally, we also generalize the classical concepts of local differential\nprivacy, R\\'enyi differential privacy and the hypothesis testing interpretation\nto the quantum setting, providing several new properties and insights.",

Nevertheless, further classification had rarely been attempted.\nThis study proposes a novel approach, using continuous Mandarin speech instead\nof a single vowel, to classify four common voice disorders (i.e. functional\ndysphonia, neoplasm, phonotrauma, and vocal palsy). Methods: In the proposed\nframework, acoustic signals are transformed into mel-frequency cepstral\ncoefficients, and a bi-directional long-short term memory network (BiLSTM) is\nadopted to model the sequential features. The experiments were conducted on a\nlarge-scale database, wherein 1,045 continuous speech were collected by the\nspeech clinic of a hospital from 2012 to 2019. Results: Experimental results\ndemonstrated that the proposed framework yields significant accuracy and\nunweighted average recall improvements of 78.12-89.27% and 50.92-80.68%,\nrespectively, compared with systems that use a single vowel. Conclusions: The\nresults are consistent with other machine learning algorithms, including gated\nrecurrent units, random forest, deep neural networks, and LSTM.

    "abstract": "The fluctuation effect of gradient expectation and variance caused by\nparameter update between consecutive iterations is neglected or confusing by\ncurrent mainstream gradient optimization algorithms.Using this fluctuation\neffect, combined with the stratified sampling strategy, this paper designs a\nnovel \\underline{M}emory \\underline{S}tochastic s\\underline{T}ratified Gradient\nDescend(\\underline{MST}GD) algorithm with an exponential convergence rate.\nSpecifically, MSTGD uses two strategies for variance reduction: the first\nstrategy is to perform variance reduction according to the proportion p of used\nhistorical gradient, which is estimated from the mean and variance of sample\ngradients before and after iteration, and the other strategy is stratified\nsampling by category. The statistic \\ $\\bar{G}_{mst}$\\ designed under these two\nstrategies can be adaptively unbiased, and its variance decays at a geometric\nrate. This enables MSTGD based on $\\bar{G}_{mst}$ to obtain an exponential\nconvergence rate of the form $\\lambda^{2(k-k_0)}$($\\lambda\\in (0,1)$,k is the\nnumber of iteration steps,$\\lambda$ is a variable related to proportion\np).Unlike most other algorithms that claim to achieve an exponential\nconvergence rate, the convergence rate is independent of parameters such as\ndataset size N, batch size n, etc., and can be achieved at a constant step\nsize.Theoretical and experimental results show the effectiveness of MSTGD",

    "abstract": "When the threat of COVID-19 became widely acknowledged, many hoped that this\nepidemic would squash \"the anti-vaccine movement\". However, when vaccines\nstarted arriving in rich countries at the end of 2020, it appeared that vaccine\nhesitancy might be an issue even in the context of this major epidemic. Does it\nmean that the mobilization of vaccine-critical activists on social media is one\nof the main causes of this reticence to vaccinate against COVID-19? In this\npaper, we wish to contribute to current work on vaccine hesitancy during the\nCOVID-19 epidemic by looking at one of the many mechanisms which can cause\nreticence towards vaccines: the capacity of vaccine-critical activists to\ninfluence a wider public on social media. We analyze the evolution of debates\nover the COVID-19 vaccine on the French Twittosphere, during two first years of\nthe pandemic, with a particular attention to the spreading capacity of\nvaccine-critical websites. We address two main questions: 1) Did\nvaccine-critical contents gain ground during this period? 2) Who were the\ncentral actors in the diffusion of these contents? While debates over vaccines\nexperienced a tremendous surge during this period, the share of\nvaccine-critical contents in these debates remains stable except for a limited\nnumber of short periods associated with specific events. Secondly, analyzing\nthe community structure of the re-tweets hyper-graph, we reconstruct the\nmesoscale structure of the information flows, identifying and characterizing\nthe major communities of users. We analyze their role in the information\necosystem: the largest right-wing community has a typical echo-chamber behavior\ncollecting all the vaccine-critical tweets from outside and recirculating it\ninside the community. The smaller left-wing community is less permeable to\nvaccine-critical contents but, has a large capacity to spread it once adopted.",

    "abstract": "Cut selection is a subroutine used in all modern mixed-integer linear\nprogramming solvers with the goal of selecting a subset of generated cuts that\ninduce optimal solver performance. These solvers have millions of parameter\ncombinations, and so are excellent candidates for parameter tuning.

We present a parametric family of\nmixed-integer linear programs together with infinitely many family-wide valid\ncuts. Some of these cuts can induce integer optimal solutions directly after\nbeing applied, while others fail to do so even if an infinite amount are\napplied. We show for a specific cut selection rule, that any finite grid search\nof the parameter space will always miss all parameter values, which select\ninteger optimal inducing cuts in an infinite amount of our problems. We propose\na variation on the design of existing graph convolutional neural networks,\nadapting them to learn cut selection rule parameters.

We give a general framework for implementing\nquantum query algorithms in Quantum CONGEST, using the concept of\nparallel-queries. We apply our framework for distributed quantum queries in two\nsettings: when data is distributed over the network, and graph theoretical\nproblems where the network defines the input. The first is slightly unusual in\nCONGEST but our results follow almost directly. The second is more traditional\nfor the CONGEST model but here we require some classical CONGEST steps to get\nour results. In the setting with distributed data, we show how a network can\nschedule a meeting in one of $k$ dates using $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{kD}+D)$ rounds,\nwith $D$ the network diameter. We also give an efficient algorithm for element\ndistinctness: if all nodes are given numbers, then the nodes can find any\nduplicates in $\\tilde{O}(n^{2/3}D^{1/3})$ rounds. We also generalize the\nprotocol for the distributed Deutsch-Jozsa problem from the two-party setting\nconsidered in [arXiv:quant-ph/9802040] to general networks, giving a novel\nseparation between exact classical and exact quantum protocols in CONGEST. When\nthe input is the network structure itself, we almost directly recover the\n$O(\\sqrt{nD})$ round diameter computation algorithm of Le Gall and Magniez\n[arXiv:1804.02917].

Finally, we give quantum speedups for\nthe problems of cycle detection and girth computation. We detect whether a\ngraph has a cycle of length at most $k$ in $O(D+(Dn)^{1/2-1/\\Theta(k)})$\nrounds.

In computer-aided diagnosis, extracting the relevant region of\ninterest, i.e., isolating the lung region of each radiography image, can be an\nessential step towards improved performance in diagnosing pulmonary disorders.\nMethods: In this work, we propose a deep learning approach to enhance abnormal\nchest x-ray (CXR) identification performance through segmentations. Our\napproach is designed in a cascaded manner and incorporates two modules: a deep\nneural network with criss-cross attention modules (XLSor) for localizing lung\nregion in CXR images and a CXR classification model with a backbone of a\nself-supervised momentum contrast (MoCo) model pre-trained on large-scale CXR\ndata sets. The proposed pipeline is evaluated on Shenzhen Hospital (SH) data\nset for the segmentation module, and COVIDx data set for both segmentation and\nclassification modules. Novel statistical analysis is conducted in addition to\nregular evaluation metrics for the segmentation module. Furthermore, the\nresults of the optimized approach are analyzed with gradient-weighted class\nactivation mapping (Grad-CAM) to investigate the rationale behind the\nclassification decisions and to interpret its choices. Results and Conclusion:\nDifferent data sets, methods, and scenarios for each module of the proposed\npipeline are examined for designing an optimized approach, which has achieved\nan accuracy of 0.946 in distinguishing abnormal CXR images (i.e., Pneumonia and\nCOVID-19) from normal ones. Numerical and visual validations suggest that\napplying automated segmentation as a pre-processing step for classification\nimproves the generalization capability and the performance of the\nclassification models.",
