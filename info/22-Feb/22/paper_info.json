    "title": "Analytic Method for Estimating Aircraft Fix Displacement from  Gyroscope's Allan-Deviation Parameters",
    "abstract": "The noise and drift requirements for a navigation-grade gyroscope are widely\nknown, yet there is no simple analytic model of how the noise and drift of a\ngyroscope influence the fix displacement error (FDE) of an inertial navigation\nsystem (INS). This work derives simple analytical expressions for the\ncross-track and along-track errors of an aircraft whose INS consists solely of\na three-axis gyroscope system with perfect knowledge of the vertical direction.\nThe error signal of each gyroscope is Gaussian white noise and drift modeled as\na first-order Markov random walk. These expressions provide a straightforward\nmean of calculating the FDE of an aircraft as a function of the flight\nduration, velocity, noise amplitude, drift amplitude, and drift's time\nconstant. These expressions are validated with Monte-Carlo simulations of long\nflights. This model quantifies the noise-versus-drift trade-off for a gyroscope\nin an inertial navigation system. It can save time when estimating the noise\nand drift that a gyroscope must exhibit to satisfy a given position-error\nrequirement, or vice versa. They are used in particular to confirm the values,\noften cited without demonstration, of the noise and drift required to meet the\nmaximum position error of an aircraft imposed by the Federal Aviation\nAdministration's required navigation performance 10 specification. Finally, it\ndemonstrates that using the minimum in the measured Allan deviation of a\ngyroscope as a metric of the drift is incorrect, because it fails to capture\nthe drift's time constant. The proper metric is the maximum in the Allan\ndeviation.",

    "abstract": "In increasingly different contexts, it happens that a human player has to\ninteract with artificial players who make decisions following decision-making\nalgorithms. How should the human player play against these algorithms to\nmaximize his utility? Does anything change if he faces one or more artificial\nplayers? The main goal of the paper is to answer these two questions. Consider\nn-player games in normal form repeated over time, where we call the human\nplayer optimizer, and the (n -- 1) artificial players, learners. We assume that\nlearners play no-regret algorithms, a class of algorithms widely used in online\nlearning and decision-making. In these games, we consider the concept of\nStackelberg equilibrium. In a recent paper, Deng, Schneider, and Sivan have\nshown that in a 2-player game the optimizer can always guarantee an expected\ncumulative utility of at least the Stackelberg value per round. In our first\nresult, we show, with counterexamples, that this result is no longer true if\nthe optimizer has to face more than one player. Therefore, we generalize the\ndefinition of Stackelberg equilibrium introducing the concept of correlated\nStackelberg equilibrium. Finally, in the main result, we prove that the\noptimizer can guarantee at least the correlated Stackelberg value per round.\nMoreover, using a version of the strong law of large numbers, we show that our\nresult is also true almost surely for the optimizer utility instead of the\noptimizer's expected utility.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental challenge in multi- and many-core systems is the correct\nexecution of concurrent access to shared data. A common drawback from existing\nsynchronization mechanisms is the loss of data locality as the shared data is\ntransferred between the accessing cores. In real-time systems, this is\nespecially important as knowledge about data access times is crucial to\nestablish bounds on execution times and guarantee the meeting of deadlines.We\npropose in this paper a refinement of our previously sketched approach of\nMigration-Based Synchronization (MBS) as well as its first practical\nimplementation. The core concept of MBS is the replacement of data migration\nwith control-flow migration to achieve synchronized memory accesses with\nguaranteed data locality. This leads to both shorter and more predictable\nexecution times for critical sections. As MBS can be used as a substitute for\nclassical locks, it can be employed in legacy applications without code\nalterations.We further examine how the gained data locality improves the\nresults of worst-case timing analyses and results in tighter bounds on\nexecution and response time. We reason about the similarity of MBS to existing\nsynchronization approaches and how it enables us to reuse existing analysis\ntechniques.Finally, we evaluate our prototype implementation, showing that MBS\ncan exploit data locality with similar overheads as traditional locking\nmechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Most existing point cloud completion methods suffered from discrete nature of\npoint clouds and unstructured prediction of points in local regions, which\nmakes it hard to reveal fine local geometric details. To resolve this issue, we\npropose SnowflakeNet with Snowflake Point Deconvolution (SPD) to generate the\ncomplete point clouds. SPD models the generation of complete point clouds as\nthe snowflake-like growth of points, where the child points are progressively\ngenerated by splitting their parent points after each SPD. Our insight of\nrevealing detailed geometry is to introduce skip-transformer in SPD to learn\npoint splitting patterns which can fit local regions the best. Skip-transformer\nleverages attention mechanism to summarize the splitting patterns used in\nprevious SPD layer to produce the splitting in current SPD layer. The locally\ncompact and structured point clouds generated by SPD precisely reveal the\nstructure characteristic of 3D shape in local patches, which enables us to\npredict highly detailed geometries. Moreover, since SPD is a general operation,\nwhich is not limited to completion, we further explore the applications of SPD\non other generative tasks, including point cloud auto-encoding, generation,\nsingle image reconstruction and upsampling.

Prior work\nallocates a fixed number of experts to each token using a top-k function\nregardless of the relative importance of different tokens. To address this, we\npropose a heterogeneous mixture-of-experts employing an expert choice method.\nInstead of letting tokens select the top-k experts, we have experts selecting\nthe top-k tokens. As a result, each token can be routed to a variable number of\nexperts and each expert can have a fixed bucket size.

Specifically, one can ask how the classical Shannon entropy,\nmutual information, and higher interaction information functions relate to each\nother. This is formally answered by Hu's theorem, which is widely known in the\nform of information diagrams: it relates disjoint unions of shapes in a Venn\ndiagram to summation rules of information functions; this establishes a bridge\nfrom set theory to information theory. While a proof of this theorem is known,\nto date it was not analyzed in detail in what generality it could be\nestablished. In this work, we view random variables together with the joint\noperation as a monoid that acts by conditioning on information functions, and\nentropy as the unique function satisfying the chain rule of information. This\nallows us to abstract away from Shannon's theory and to prove a generalization\nof Hu's theorem, which applies to Shannon entropy of countably infinite\ndiscrete random variables, Kolmogorov complexity, Tsallis entropy, (Tsallis)\nKullback-Leibler Divergence, cross-entropy, submodular information functions,\nand the generalization error in machine learning.

    "abstract": "Contact tracing has been proven an effective approach to mitigate the virus\nspread in pandemics like COVID-19. As an emerging powerful decentralized data\nsharing and storage technique, blockchain has been explored to ensure data\nprivacy and security in contact tracing processes. Existing work mostly treats\nblockchain as a separate storage system requiring third-party servers to\nperform data collection and computation, and avoids revealing detailed interior\ndesign of blockchain storage. However, blockchain system is capable to work as\na fully automatic distributed contact tracing system without any third-party\nserver by tackling the following challenges: 1) how to ensure the contact\ntracing correctness without compromising privacy; 2) how to design efficient\nand effective consensus mechanism to ensure the system security and robustness;\n3) how to design an incentive mechanism to motivate people to behave honestly.\nIn this article, we present the Blockchain Based Contact Tracing Framework for\nthe contact tracing problem. In the framework, RSA encryption based transaction\nverification algorithm (RSA-TVA) is proposed to ensure contact tracing\ncorrectness, which can achieve more than 97% contact case recording accuracy\neven when each person has 60% chance of failing to verify the contact\ninformation. Reputation Corrected Delegated Proof of Stack (RC-DPoS) consensus\nmechanism is applied to jointly work with the proposed incentive mechanism,\nwhich can ensure timeliness of reporting contact cases and meanwhile balance\nthe reward gained by different people. A novel contact tracing simulation\nenvironment is created in the simulation part, which considers three different\ncontact scenarios. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness,\nrobustness and attack resistance of RSA-TVA and RC-DPoS in the proposed\nBlockchain Based Contact Tracing Framework.",

    "abstract": "Leader-based consensus protocols must undergo a view-change phase to elect a\nnew leader when the current leader fails. The new leader is often decided upon\na candidate server that collects votes from a quorum of servers. However,\nvoting-based election mechanisms intrinsically cause competition in leadership\ncandidacy when each candidate collects only partial votes. This split-vote\nscenario can result in no leadership winner and prolong the undesired\nview-change period. In this paper, we investigate a case study of Raft's leader\nelection mechanism and propose a new leader election protocol, called ESCAPE,\nthat fundamentally solves split votes by prioritizing servers based on their\nlog responsiveness. ESCAPE dynamically assigns servers with a configuration\nthat offers different priorities through Raft's periodic heartbeat. In each\nassignment, ESCAPE keeps track of server log responsiveness and assigns\nconfigurations that are inclined to win an election to more up-to-date servers,\nthereby preparing a pool of prioritized candidates. Consequently, when the next\nelection takes place, the candidate with the highest priority will defeat its\ncounterparts and becomes the next leader without competition. The evaluation\nresults show that ESCAPE progressively reduces the leader election time when\nthe cluster scales up, and the improvement becomes more significant under\nmessage loss.",

We employ a hybrid precoding\n(HP) architecture with three stages: (i) radio frequency (RF) beamformer, (ii)\nbaseband (BB) precoder, (iii) resource allocation (RA) block. First, a single\nRF beamformer block is built for all subcarriers via the slow time-varying\nangle-of-departure (AoD) information. For enhancing the energy efficiency, the\nRF beamformer aims to reduce the hardware cost/complexity and total power\nconsumption via a low number of RF chains. Afterwards, the reduced-size\neffective channel state information (CSI) is utilized in the design of a\ndistinct BB precoder and RA block for each subcarrier. The BB precoder is\ndeveloped via regularized zero-forcing technique. Finally, the RA block is\nbuilt via the proposed GA-RA technique for throughput maximization by\nallocating the power and subcarrier resources. The illustrative results show\nthat the throughput performance in the MU-mMIMO-OFDM systems is greatly\nenhanced via the proposed GA-RA technique compared to both equal RA (EQ-RA) and\nparticle swarm optimization based RA (PSO-RA). Moreover, the performance gain\nratio increases with the increasing number of subcarriers, particularly for low\ntransmission powers.",

    "title": "Enabling Volatile Caches for Energy Harvesting Systems",
    "abstract": "Energy harvesting systems have shown their unique benefit of ultra-long\noperation time without maintenance and are expected to be more prevalent in the\nera of Internet of Things. However, due to the batteryless nature, they suffer\nunpredictable frequent power outages. They thus require a lightweight mechanism\nfor crash consistency since saving/restoring checkpoints across the outages can\nlimit forward progress by consuming hard-won energy. For the reason, energy\nharvesting systems have been designed with a non-volatile memory (NVM) only.\nThe use of a volatile data cache has been assumed to be not viable or at least\nchallenging due to the difficulty to ensure cacheline persistence. In this\npaper, we propose ReplayCache, a software-only crash consistency scheme that\nenables commodity energy harvesting systems to exploit a volatile data cache.\nReplayCache does not have to ensure the persistence of dirty cachelines or\nrecord their logs at run time. Instead, ReplayCache recovery runtime\nre-executes the potentially unpersisted stores in the wake of power failure to\nrestore the consistent NVM state, from which interrupted program can safely\nresume. To support store replay during recovery, ReplayCache partitions program\ninto a series of regions in a way that store operand registers remain intact\nwithin each region, and checkpoints all registers just before power failure\nusing the crash consistency mechanism of the commodity systems. For\nperformance, ReplayCache enables region-level persistence that allows the\nstores in a region to be asynchronously persisted until the region ends,\nexploiting ILP. The evaluation with 23 benchmark applications show that\ncompared to the baseline with no caches, ReplayCache can achieve about 10.72x\nand 8.5x-8.9x speedup (on geometric mean) for the scenarios without and with\npower outages, respectively.",

Experimental results with 36 benchmarks demonstrate\nthat Turnpike only incurs a 0-14% run-time overhead on average while the\nstate-of-the-art incurs a 29-84% overhead when the worst-case latency of the\nsensor based error detection is 10-50 cycles.",

The strategy is\nformulated under an optimization framework, where the optimal control plan is\ndetermined based on real-time traffic conditions. The impacts of tunable model\nparameters on the produced control plan are discussed in detail. The efficiency\nof the proposed multilane strategy is demonstrated in a micro-simulation\nenvironment. The results show that the coordination can substantially improve\nthe overall ramp merging efficiency and prevent recurrent traffic congestions,\nespecially under high traffic volume conditions.",

    "abstract": "On-ramp merging areas are typical bottlenecks in the freeway network, since\nmerging on-ramp vehicles may cause intensive disturbances on the mainline\ntraffic flow and lead to various negative impacts on traffic efficiency and\nsafety. The connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), with their capabilities\nof real-time communication and precise motion control, hold a great potential\nto facilitate ramp merging operation through enhanced coordination strategies.\nThis paper presents a comprehensive review of the existing ramp merging\nstrategies leveraging CAVs, focusing on the latest trends and developments in\nthe research field. The review comprehensively covers 44 papers recently\npublished in leading transportation journals. Based on the application context,\ncontrol strategies are categorized into three categories: merging into\nsing-lane freeways with total CAVs, merging into sing-lane freeways with mixed\ntraffic flows, and merging into multilane freeways. Relevant literature is\nreviewed regarding the required technologies, control decision level, applied\nmethods, and impacts on traffic performance.

We demonstrate GraphQ through two\nexample usage scenarios: analyzing reusable subroutines in program workflows\nand semantic scene graph search in images. Quantitative experiments show that\nNeuroAlign achieves 19-29% improvement in node-alignment accuracy compared to\nbaseline GNN and provides up to 100x speedup compared to combinatorial\nalgorithms.

GeomE subsumes several state-of-the-art KGE models and is able to\nmodel diverse relations patterns. On top of this, we extend GeomE to TGeomE for\ntemporal KGE, which performs 4th-order tensor factorization of a temporal KG\nand devises a new linear temporal regularization for time representation\nlearning. Moreover, we study the effect of time granularity on the performance\nof TGeomE models.

Neuroscience-inspired learning algorithms, however, such as\n\\emph{predictive coding}, which utilize local learning, have the potential to\novercome these limitations and advance beyond current deep learning\ntechnologies.

In this survey, we review works that have contributed to\nthis perspective and demonstrate the close theoretical connections between\npredictive coding and backpropagation, as well as works that highlight the\nmultiple advantages of using predictive coding models over\nbackpropagation-trained neural networks.

Such techniques, in general, require a formal\nrepresentation of the protocol, often in the form of a finite state machine\n(FSM). Unfortunately, many protocols are only described in English prose, and\nimplementing even a simple network protocol as an FSM is time-consuming and\nprone to subtle logical errors. Automatically extracting protocol FSMs from\ndocumentation can significantly contribute to increased use of these techniques\nand result in more robust and secure protocol implementations.\nIn this work we focus on attacker synthesis as a representative technique for\nprotocol security, and on RFCs as a representative format for protocol prose\ndescription. Unlike other works that rely on rule-based approaches or use\noff-the-shelf NLP tools directly, we suggest a data-driven approach for\nextracting FSMs from RFC documents. Specifically, we use a hybrid approach\nconsisting of three key steps: (1) large-scale word-representation learning for\ntechnical language, (2) focused zero-shot learning for mapping protocol text to\na protocol-independent information language, and (3) rule-based mapping from\nprotocol-independent information to a specific protocol FSM. We show the\ngeneralizability of our FSM extraction by using the RFCs for six different\nprotocols: BGPv4, DCCP, LTP, PPTP, SCTP and TCP. We demonstrate how automated\nextraction of an FSM from an RFC can be applied to the synthesis of attacks,\nwith TCP and DCCP as case-studies.

    "abstract": "The notion of concept drift refers to the phenomenon that the distribution,\nwhich is underlying the observed data, changes over time; as a consequence\nmachine learning models may become inaccurate and need adjustment. Many\nunsupervised approaches for drift detection rely on measuring the discrepancy\nbetween the sample distributions of two time windows. This may be done\ndirectly, after some preprocessing (feature extraction, embedding into a latent\nspace, etc.), or with respect to inferred features (mean, variance, conditional\nprobabilities etc.). Most drift detection methods can be distinguished in what\nmetric they use, how this metric is estimated, and how the decision threshold\nis found. In this paper, we analyze structural properties of the drift induced\nsignals in the context of different metrics. We compare different types of\nestimators and metrics theoretically and empirically and investigate the\nrelevance of the single metric components. In addition, we propose new choices\nand demonstrate their suitability in several experiments.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning involves agents interacting with an environment to\ncomplete tasks. When rewards provided by the environment are sparse, agents may\nnot receive immediate feedback on the quality of actions that they take,\nthereby affecting learning of policies. In this paper, we propose to methods to\naugment the reward signal from the environment with an additional reward termed\nshaping advice in both single and multi-agent reinforcement learning. The\nshaping advice is specified as a difference of potential functions at\nconsecutive time-steps. Each potential function is a function of observations\nand actions of the agents. The use of potential functions is underpinned by an\ninsight that the total potential when starting from any state and returning to\nthe same state is always equal to zero. We show through theoretical analyses\nand experimental validation that the shaping advice does not distract agents\nfrom completing tasks specified by the environment reward. Theoretically, we\nprove that the convergence of policy gradients and value functions when using\nshaping advice implies the convergence of these quantities in the absence of\nshaping advice. We design two algorithms- Shaping Advice in Single-agent\nreinforcement learning (SAS) and Shaping Advice in Multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (SAM). Shaping advice in SAS and SAM needs to be specified only once\nat the start of training, and can easily be provided by non-experts.\nExperimentally, we evaluate SAS and SAM on two tasks in single-agent\nenvironments and three tasks in multi-agent environments that have sparse\nrewards. We observe that using shaping advice results in agents learning\npolicies to complete tasks faster, and obtain higher rewards than algorithms\nthat do not use shaping advice.",

The major challenge of SBR is how to capture richer\nrelations in between items and learn ID-based item embeddings to capture such\nrelations. Recent studies propose to first construct an item graph from\nsessions and employ a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to encode item embedding from\nthe graph. Although such graph-based approaches have achieved performance\nimprovements, their GNNs are not suitable for ID-based embedding learning for\nthe SBR task. In this paper, we argue that the objective of such ID-based\nembedding learning is to capture a kind of \\textit{neighborhood affinity} in\nthat the embedding of a node is similar to that of its neighbors' in the\nembedding space. We propose a new graph neural network, called Graph Spring\nNetwork (GSN), for learning ID-based item embedding on an item graph to\noptimize neighborhood affinity in the embedding space. Furthermore, we argue\nthat even stacking multiple GNN layers may not be enough to encode potential\nrelations for two item nodes far-apart in a graph. In this paper, we propose a\nstrategy that first selects some informative item anchors and then encode\nitems' potential relations to such anchors. In summary, we propose a GSN-IAS\nmodel (Graph Spring Network and Informative Anchor Selection) for the SBR task.\nWe first construct an item graph to describe items' co-occurrences in all\nsessions. We design the GSN for ID-based item embedding learning and propose an\n\\textit{item entropy} measure to select informative anchors.

To dynamically match the products with the best\nadopters, in this work, we propose a novel free trial user selection model\nnamed SMILE, which is based on reinforcement learning (RL) where an agent\nactively selects specific adopters aiming to maximize the profit after free\ntrials. Specifically, we design a tree structure to reformulate the action\nspace, which allows us to select adopters from massive user space efficiently.\nThe experimental analysis on three datasets demonstrates the proposed model's\nsuperiority and elucidates why reinforcement learning and tree structure can\nimprove performance.

Here we introduce a\ndistributed non-negative RESCAL algorithm for heterogeneous CPU/GPU\narchitectures with automatic selection of the number of latent communities\n(model selection), called pyDRESCALk. We demonstrate the correctness of\npyDRESCALk with real-world and large synthetic tensors, and the efficacy\nshowing near-linear scaling that concurs with the theoretical complexities.\nFinally, pyDRESCALk determines the number of latent communities in an\n11-terabyte dense and 9-exabyte sparse synthetic tensor.",

    "abstract": "Robust Reinforcement Learning (RL) focuses on improving performances under\nmodel errors or adversarial attacks, which facilitates the real-life deployment\nof RL agents. Robust Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (RARL) is one of the\nmost popular frameworks for robust RL. However, most of the existing literature\nmodels RARL as a zero-sum simultaneous game with Nash equilibrium as the\nsolution concept, which could overlook the sequential nature of RL deployments,\nproduce overly conservative agents, and induce training instability. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel hierarchical formulation of robust RL - a\ngeneral-sum Stackelberg game model called RRL-Stack - to formalize the\nsequential nature and provide extra flexibility for robust training. We develop\nthe Stackelberg Policy Gradient algorithm to solve RRL-Stack, leveraging the\nStackelberg learning dynamics by considering the adversary's response. Our\nmethod generates challenging yet solvable adversarial environments which\nbenefit RL agents' robust learning. Our algorithm demonstrates better training\nstability and robustness against different testing conditions in the\nsingle-agent robotics control and multi-agent highway merging tasks.",

    "abstract": "Agents that operate in an unknown environment are bound to make mistakes\nwhile learning, including, at least occasionally, some that lead to\ncatastrophic consequences. When humans make catastrophic mistakes, they are\nexpected to learn never to repeat them, such as a toddler who touches a hot\nstove and immediately learns never to do so again. In this work we consider a\nnovel class of POMDPs, called POMDP with Catastrophic Actions (POMDP-CA) in\nwhich pairs of states and actions are labeled as catastrophic. Agents that act\nin a POMDP-CA do not have a priori knowledge about which (state, action) pairs\nare catastrophic, thus they are sure to make mistakes when trying to learn any\nmeaningful policy. Rather, their aim is to maximize reward while never\nrepeating mistakes.\nAs a first step of avoiding mistake repetition, we leverage the concept of a\nshield which prevents agents from executing specific actions from specific\nstates.\nIn particular, we store catastrophic mistakes (unsafe pairs of states and\nactions) that agents make in a database. Agents are then forbidden to pick\nactions that appear in the database. This approach is especially useful in a\ncontinual learning setting, where groups of agents perform a variety of tasks\nover time in the same underlying environment. In this setting, a task-agnostic\nshield can be constructed in a way that stores mistakes made by any agent, such\nthat once one agent in a group makes a mistake the entire group learns to never\nrepeat that mistake. This paper introduces a variant of the PPO algorithm that\nutilizes this shield, called ShieldPPO, and empirically evaluates it in a\ncontrolled environment.\nResults indicate that ShieldPPO outperforms PPO, as well as baseline methods\nfrom the safe reinforcement learning literature, in a range of settings.",

Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a well-known\nexplainable unsupervised learning method for dimensionality reduction, latent\nfeature extraction, blind source separation, data mining, and machine learning.\nIn this paper, we introduce a new distributed out-of-memory NMF method, named\npyDNMF-GPU, designed for modern heterogeneous CPU/GPU architectures that is\ncapable of factoring exascale-sized dense and sparse matrices. Our method\nreduces the latency associated with local data transfer between the GPU and\nhost using CUDA streams, and reduces the latency associated with collective\ncommunications (both intra-node and inter-node) via NCCL primitives. In\naddition, sparse and dense matrix multiplications are significantly accelerated\nwith GPU cores, resulting in good scalability. We set new benchmarks for the\nsize of the data being analyzed: in experiments, we measure up to 76x\nimprovement on a single GPU over running on a single 18 core CPU and we show\ngood weak scaling on up to 4096 multi-GPU cluster nodes with approximately\n25,000 GPUs, when decomposing a dense 340 Terabyte-size matrix and a 11\nExabyte-size sparse matrix of density 10e-6.

Organizations across North America perform outreach to sex\nindustry workers to offer assistance in the form of services (e.g., healthcare,\nfinancial assistance, housing), prayer, and intervention.

However, little is known about the\nefficacy of anti-trafficking outreach technology, nor the potential risks of\nusing it to identify and contact the highly stigmatized and marginalized\npopulation of those working in the sex industry.\nIn this work, we investigate the use, context, benefits, and harms of an\nanti-trafficking technology platform via qualitative interviews with multiple\nstakeholders: the technology developers (n=6), organizations that use the\ntechnology (n=17), and sex industry workers who have been contacted or wish to\nbe contacted (n=24).

HAAN is designed to\nexploit the self-similarity of texture and structure information by learning\nthe holistic channel-spatial feature correlations between the foggy image with\nits several derived images. Moreover, in the fog synthetic module, we utilize\nthe atmospheric scattering model to guide it to improve the generative quality\nby focusing on an atmospheric light optimization with a novel sky segmentation\nnetwork. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show\nthat HAAN outperforms state-of-the-art defogging methods in terms of\nquantitative accuracy and subjective visual quality.",

    "title": "SODA: Site Object Detection dAtaset for Deep Learning in Construction",
    "abstract": "Computer vision-based deep learning object detection algorithms have been\ndeveloped sufficiently powerful to support the ability to recognize various\nobjects. Although there are currently general datasets for object detection,\nthere is still a lack of large-scale, open-source dataset for the construction\nindustry, which limits the developments of object detection algorithms as they\ntend to be data-hungry. Therefore, this paper develops a new large-scale image\ndataset specifically collected and annotated for the construction site, called\nSite Object Detection dAtaset (SODA), which contains 15 kinds of object classes\ncategorized by workers, materials, machines, and layout. Firstly, more than\n20,000 images were collected from multiple construction sites in different site\nconditions, weather conditions, and construction phases, which covered\ndifferent angles and perspectives. After careful screening and processing,\n19,846 images including 286,201 objects were then obtained and annotated with\nlabels in accordance with predefined categories. Statistical analysis shows\nthat the developed dataset is advantageous in terms of diversity and volume.\nFurther evaluation with two widely-adopted object detection algorithms based on\ndeep learning (YOLO v3/ YOLO v4) also illustrates the feasibility of the\ndataset for typical construction scenarios, achieving a maximum mAP of 81.47%.\nIn this manner, this research contributes a large-scale image dataset for the\ndevelopment of deep learning-based object detection methods in the construction\nindustry and sets up a performance benchmark for further evaluation of\ncorresponding algorithms in this area.",

    "title": "HDAM: Heuristic Difference Attention Module for Convolutional Neural  Networks",
    "abstract": "The attention mechanism is one of the most important priori knowledge to\nenhance convolutional neural networks. Most attention mechanisms are bound to\nthe convolutional layer and use local or global contextual information to\nrecalibrate the input. This is a popular attention strategy design method.\nGlobal contextual information helps the network to consider the overall\ndistribution, while local contextual information is more general. The\ncontextual information makes the network pay attention to the mean or maximum\nvalue of a particular receptive field. Different from the most attention\nmechanism, this article proposes a novel attention mechanism with the heuristic\ndifference attention module, HDAM. HDAM's input recalibration is based on the\ndifference between the local and global contextual information instead of the\nmean and maximum values. At the same time, to make different layers have a more\nsuitable local receptive field size and increase the exibility of the local\nreceptive field design, we use genetic algorithm to heuristically produce local\nreceptive fields. First, HDAM extracts the mean value of the global and local\nreceptive fields as the corresponding contextual information. Then the\ndifference between the global and local contextual information is calculated.\nFinally HDAM uses this difference to recalibrate the input. In addition, we use\nthe heuristic ability of genetic algorithm to search for the local receptive\nfield size of each layer. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that\nHDAM can use fewer parameters than other attention mechanisms to achieve higher\naccuracy. We implement HDAM with the Python library, Pytorch, and the code and\nmodels will be publicly available.",

    "abstract": "Motor imagery (MI) is a common brain computer interface (BCI) paradigm. EEG\nis non-stationary with low signal-to-noise, classifying motor imagery tasks of\nthe same participant from different EEG recording sessions is generally\nchallenging, as EEG data distribution may vary tremendously among different\nacquisition sessions. Although it is intuitive to consider the cross-session MI\nclassification as a domain adaptation problem, the rationale and feasible\napproach is not elucidated. In this paper, we propose a Siamese deep domain\nadaptation (SDDA) framework for cross-session MI classification based on\nmathematical models in domain adaptation theory. The proposed framework can be\neasily applied to most existing artificial neural networks without altering the\nnetwork structure, which facilitates our method with great flexibility and\ntransferability. In the proposed framework, domain invariants were firstly\nconstructed jointly with channel normalization and Euclidean alignment. Then,\nembedding features from source and target domain were mapped into the\nReproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) and aligned accordingly. A cosine-based\ncenter loss was also integrated into the framework to improve the\ngeneralizability of the SDDA. The proposed framework was validated with two\nclassic and popular convolutional neural networks from BCI research field\n(EEGNet and ConvNet) in two MI-EEG public datasets (BCI Competition IV IIA,\nIIB). Compared to the vanilla EEGNet and ConvNet, the proposed SDDA framework\nwas able to boost the MI classification accuracy by 15.2%, 10.2% respectively\nin IIA dataset, and 5.5%, 4.2% in IIB dataset. The final MI classification\naccuracy reached 82.01% in IIA dataset and 87.52% in IIB, which outperformed\nthe state-of-the-art methods in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Deep imitation learning is a promising method for dexterous robot\nmanipulation because it only requires demonstration samples for learning\nmanipulation skills. In this paper, deep imitation learning is applied to tasks\nthat require force feedback, such as bottle opening. However, simple visual\nfeedback systems, such as teleoperation, cannot be applied because they do not\nprovide force feedback to operators. Bilateral teleoperation has been used for\ndemonstration with force feedback; however, this requires an expensive and\ncomplex bilateral robot system. In this paper, a new master-to-robot (M2R)\ntransfer learning system is presented that does not require robots but can\nstill teach dexterous force feedback-based manipulation tasks to robots. The\nhuman directly demonstrates a task using a low-cost controller that resembles\nthe kinematic parameters of the robot arm. Using this controller, the operator\ncan naturally feel the force feedback without any expensive bilateral system.\nFurthermore, the M2R transfer system can overcome domain gaps between the\nmaster and robot using the gaze-based imitation learning framework and a simple\ncalibration method. To demonstrate this, the proposed system was evaluated on a\nbottle-cap-opening task that requires force feedback only for the master\ndemonstration.",

    "abstract": "Samples in large-scale datasets may be mislabeled due to various reasons, and\nDeep Neural Networks can easily over-fit to the noisy label data. To tackle\nthis problem, the key point is to alleviate the harm of these noisy labels.\nMany existing methods try to divide training data into clean and noisy subsets\nin terms of loss values, and then process the noisy label data varied. One of\nthe reasons hindering a better performance is the hard samples. As hard samples\nalways have relatively large losses whether their labels are clean or noisy,\nthese methods could not divide them precisely. Instead, we propose a Tripartite\nsolution to partition training data more precisely into three subsets: hard,\nnoisy, and clean. The partition criteria are based on the inconsistent\npredictions of two networks, and the inconsistency between the prediction of a\nnetwork and the given label. To minimize the harm of noisy labels but maximize\nthe value of noisy label data, we apply a low-weight learning on hard data and\na self-supervised learning on noisy label data without using the given labels.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that Tripartite can filter out noisy label\ndata more precisely, and outperforms most state-of-the-art methods on five\nbenchmark datasets, especially on real-world datasets.",

However, there is a lack of\nunderstanding on tools capable of achieving differential privacy, and it is not\nclear what to expect from existing differential privacy tools when implementing\nprivacy protection. Such an obstacle limits private applications' further\nprosperity. This paper reviews and evaluates the state-of-the-art open-source\ndifferential privacy tools of different domains using various estimating\ncategories and privacy settings. Particularly, we look into the performances of\nthree differential privacy tools for machine learning, two for statistical\nquery, and four for synthetic data generation.

Finally, we openly release our evaluation\ncoding repository, a framework that users can reuse to further evaluate the\nstudied tools and beyond.

Thus, high-quality negative samples are extremely important in KGE.\nHowever, the present KGE models either rely on simple negative sampling\nmethods, which makes it difficult to obtain informative negative triplets; or\nemploy complex adversarial methods, which requires more training data and\nstrategies. In addition, these methods can only construct negative triplets\nusing the existing entities, which limits the potential to explore harder\nnegative triplets. To address these issues, we adopt mixing operation in\ngenerating harder negative samples for knowledge graphs and introduce an\ninexpensive but effective method called MixKG. Technically, MixKG first\nproposes two kinds of criteria to filter hard negative triplets among the\nsampled negatives: based on scoring function and based on correct entity\nsimilarity. Then, MixKG synthesizes harder negative samples via the convex\ncombinations of the paired selected hard negatives. Experiments on two public\ndatasets and four classical KGE methods show MixKG is superior to previous\nnegative sampling algorithms.",

Using the tools of information theory, we estimate\nthe information that the spikes carry on relevant aspects of an input stimulus.\nWe find disparities in the coding efficiencies of the algorithms, where Leaky\nIntegrate-and-Fire coding performs best.

Tools for data validation may save the day of computer programmers. In\nfact, processing invalid data is a waste of resources at best, and a drama at\nworst if the problem remains unnoticed and wrong results are used for business.\nAnswer Set Programming (ASP) is not an exception, but the quest for better and\nbetter performance resulted in systems that essentially do not validate data.\nEven under the simplistic assumption that input/output data are eventually\nvalidated by external tools, invalid data may appear in other portions of the\nprogram, and go undetected until some other module of the designed software\nsuddenly breaks. This paper formalizes the problem of data validation for ASP\nprograms, introduces a language to specify data validation, and presents\n\\textsc{valasp}, a tool to inject data validation in ordinary programs. The\nproposed approach promotes fail-fast techniques at coding time without imposing\nany lag on the deployed system if data are pretended to be valid. Validation\ncan be specified in terms of statements using YAML, ASP and Python.\nAdditionally, the proposed approach opens the possibility to use ASP for\nvalidating data of imperative programming languages.

    "abstract": "Single image deraining has been an important topic in low-level computer\nvision tasks. The atmospheric veiling effect (which is generated by rain\naccumulation, similar to fog) usually appears with the rain. Most deep\nlearning-based single image deraining methods mainly focus on rain streak\nremoval by disregarding this effect, which leads to low-quality deraining\nperformance. In addition, these methods are trained only on synthetic data,\nhence they do not take into account real-world rainy images. To address the\nabove issues, we propose a novel unsupervised attentive-adversarial learning\nframework (UALF) for single image deraining that trains on both synthetic and\nreal rainy images while simultaneously capturing both rain streaks and rain\naccumulation features. UALF consists of a Rain-fog2Clean (R2C) transformation\nblock and a Clean2Rain-fog (C2R) transformation block. In R2C, to better\ncharacterize the rain-fog fusion feature and to achieve high-quality deraining\nperformance, we employ an attention rain-fog feature extraction network (ARFE)\nto exploit the self-similarity of global and local rain-fog information by\nlearning the spatial feature correlations. Moreover, to improve the\ntransformation ability of C2R, we design a rain-fog feature decoupling and\nreorganization network (RFDR) by embedding a rainy image degradation model and\na mixed discriminator to preserve richer texture details. Extensive experiments\non benchmark rain-fog and rain datasets show that UALF outperforms\nstate-of-the-art deraining methods.

    "title": "Reward Modeling for Mitigating Toxicity in Transformer-based Language  Models",
    "abstract": "Transformer-based language models are able to generate fluent text and be\nefficiently adapted across various natural language generation tasks. However,\nlanguage models that are pretrained on large unlabeled web text corpora have\nbeen shown to suffer from degenerating toxic content and social bias behaviors,\nconsequently hindering their safe deployment. Various detoxification methods\nwere proposed to mitigate the language model's toxicity; however, these methods\nstruggled to detoxify language models when conditioned on prompts that contain\nspecific social identities related to gender, race, or religion. In this study,\nwe propose Reinforce-Detoxify; A reinforcement learning-based method for\nmitigating toxicity in language models. We address the challenge of safety in\nlanguage models and propose a new reward model that is able to detect toxic\ncontent and mitigate unintended bias towards social identities in toxicity\nprediction. The experiments demonstrate that the Reinforce-Detoxify method for\nlanguage model detoxification outperforms existing detoxification approaches in\nautomatic evaluation metrics, indicating the ability of our approach in\nlanguage model detoxification and less prone to unintended bias toward social\nidentities in generated content.",

OPE/L is nonetheless sensitive to discrepancies between\nthe data-generating environment and that where policies are deployed. Recent\nwork proposed distributionally robust OPE/L (DROPE/L) to remedy this, but the\nproposal relies on inverse-propensity weighting, whose regret rates may\ndeteriorate if propensities are estimated and whose variance is suboptimal even\nif not. For vanilla OPE/L, this is solved by doubly robust (DR) methods, but\nthey do not naturally extend to the more complex DROPE/L, which involves a\nworst-case expectation. In this paper, we propose the first DR algorithms for\nDROPE/L with KL-divergence uncertainty sets. For evaluation, we propose\nLocalized Doubly Robust DROPE (LDR$^2$OPE) and prove its semiparametric\nefficiency under weak product rates conditions. Notably, thanks to a\nlocalization technique, LDR$^2$OPE only requires fitting a small number of\nregressions, just like DR methods for vanilla OPE. For learning, we propose\nContinuum Doubly Robust DROPL (CDR$^2$OPL) and show that, under a product rate\ncondition involving a continuum of regressions, it enjoys a fast regret rate of\n$\\mathcal{O}(N^{-1/2})$ even when unknown propensities are nonparametrically\nestimated.

    "abstract": "Voltage unbalance in distribution networks (DN) is expected to grow with\nincreasing penetration of single-phase distributed generation and single-phase\nloads such as electric vehicle chargers. Unbalance mitigation will be a\nsignificant concern as voltage unbalance leads to increased losses, reduced\nmotor and inverter efficiency, and becomes a limiting factor for DN operation.\nThe true definition of the unbalance metric needs phasor measurements of\nnetwork voltage and current. However, such phasor measurements are generally\nnot available in real life and as such approximate definitions are widely used\ndue to their simplicity. This work aims to compare the true voltage unbalance\ndefinition and approximate unbalance metrics derived from phase voltage\nmagnitude, as phase voltage magnitudes are commonly measured by digital\nmetering infrastructure. For the comparison, multi-period power flow\nsimulations are performed for 161 Spanish distribution feeders with R/X ratios\nvarying from 2.87 to 14.68. We observe that phase magnitude-based unbalance\nmetrics reasonably approximate the true unbalance for higher R/X ratios with a\nvarying load power factor in a DN. Furthermore, the approximate unbalance\nmetrics slightly improve for a low DN power factor due to the increase in DN\nunbalance.

The latter concerns\nfinite codes $Y$ which are subsets of $a^* B a^*$, where $a$ is a letter and\n$B$ is an alphabet not containing $a$.

    "abstract": "Modern cloud computing advances have been pressing application modernization\nin the last 15 years, stressing the need for application redesign towards the\nuse of more distributed and ephemeral resources. From the initial IaaS and PaaS\napproaches, to microservices and now to the serverless model (and especially\nthe Function as a Service approach), new challenges arise constantly for\napplication developers. This paper presents a design and development\nenvironment that aims to ease application evolution and migration to the new\nFaaS model, based on the widely used Node-RED open source tool. The goal of the\nenvironment is to enable a more user friendly and abstract function and\nworkflow creation for complex FaaS applications. To this end, it bypasses\nworkflow description and function reuse limitations of the current FaaS\nplatforms, by providing an extendable, pattern-enriched palette of ready-made,\nreusable functionality that can be combined in arbitrary ways. The environment\nembeds seamless DevOps processes for generating the deployable artefacts (i.e.\nfunctions and images) of the FaaS platform (Openwhisk). Annotation mechanisms\nare also available for the developer to dictate diverse execution options or\nmanagement guidelines towards the deployment and operation stacks. The\nevaluation is based on case studies of indicative scenarios, including\ncreating, registering and executing functions and flows based on the Node-RED\nruntime, embedding of existing legacy code in a FaaS environment, parallelizing\na workload, collecting data at the edge and creating function orchestrators to\naccompany the application. For the latter, a detailed argumentation is provided\nas to why this process should not be constrained by the \"double billing\"\nprinciple of FaaS.",

We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of various\nparallel versions of these algorithms and evaluate their performance on\nmulti-core processors. We show that a straightforward coarse-grained\nparallelisation approach is not scalable and suffers from load imbalance\nissues. To eliminate the load imbalance, we modify the Johnson and the\nRead-Tarjan algorithms to exploit finer-grained parallelism. We show that our\nfine-grained parallel Read-Tarjan algorithm is theoretically work efficient --\ni.e., it does no more work than its serial version. However, our fine-grained\nparallel Johnson algorithm does not share this property. Yet, in practice, our\nfine-grained parallel Johnson algorithm outperforms our fine-grained parallel\nRead-Tarjan algorithm. In any case, both of our contributed fine-grained\nparallel algorithms are scalable, meaning that they can effectively utilise an\nincreasing number of software threads, which we prove theoretically and\ndemonstrate through extensive experiments. On a cluster of multi-core CPUs with\n$256$ physical cores that can execute $1024$ simultaneous threads, our\nfine-grained parallel Johnson and Read-Tarjan algorithms are respectively up to\n$435\\times$ and $470\\times$ faster than their single-threaded versions.

Hex meshes vary in\ncomplexity from structured to unstructured depending on application or domain\nof interest. Fully structured meshes require that all interior mesh edges are\nadjacent to exactly four hexes. Edges not satisfying this criteria are\nconsidered singular and indicate an unstructured hex mesh. Singular edges join\ntogether into singular curves that either form closed cycles, end on the mesh\nboundary, or end at a singular node, a complex junction of more than two\nsingular curves. While all hex meshes with singularities are unstructured,\nthose with more complex singular nodes tend to have more distorted elements and\nsmaller scaled Jacobian values. In this work, we study the topology of singular\nnodes. We show that all eight of the most common singular nodes are\ndecomposable into just singular curves. We further show that all singular\nnodes, regardless of edge valence, are locally decomposable. Finally we\ndemonstrate these decompositions on hex meshes, thereby decreasing their\ndistortion and converting all singular nodes into singular curves.

    "abstract": "Multiscale elliptic equations with scale separation are often approximated by\nthe corresponding homogenized equations with slowly varying homogenized\ncoefficients (the G-limit). The traditional homogenization techniques typically\nrely on the periodicity of the multiscale coefficients, thus finding the\nG-limits often requires sophisticated techniques in more general settings even\nwhen multiscale coefficient is known, if possible. Alternatively, we propose a\nsimple approach to estimate the G-limits from (noisy-free or noisy) multiscale\nsolution data, either from the existing forward multiscale solvers or sensor\nmeasurements. By casting this problem into an inverse problem, our approach\nadopts physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) algorithm to estimate the\nG-limits from the multiscale solution data by leveraging a priori knowledge of\nthe underlying homogenized equations. Unlike the existing approaches, our\napproach does not rely on the periodicity assumption or the known multiscale\ncoefficient during the learning stage, allowing us to estimate homogenized\ncoefficients in more general settings beyond the periodic setting.

    "abstract": "Robot manipulation of rope-like objects is an interesting problem that has\nsome critical applications, such as autonomous robotic suturing. Solving for\nand controlling rope is difficult due to the complexity of rope physics and the\nchallenge of building fast and accurate models of deformable materials. While\nmore data-driven approaches have become more popular for finding controllers\nthat learn to do a single task, there is still a strong motivation for a\nmodel-based method that could be used to solve a large variety of optimization\nproblems. Towards this end, we introduced compliant, position-based dynamics\n(XPBD) to model rope-like objects. Using geometric constraints, the model can\nrepresent the coupling of shear/stretch and bend/twist effects. Of crucial\nimportance is that our formulation is differentiable, which can solve parameter\nestimation problems and improve the matching of rope physics to real-life\nscenarios (i.e., the real-to-sim problem). For the generality of rope-like\nobjects, two different solvers are proposed to handle the inextensible and\nextensible effects of varied material stiffness for the rope. We demonstrate\nour framework's robustness and accuracy on real-to-sim experimental setups\nusing the Baxter robot and the da Vinci research kit (DVRK).

In the field of 3D object detection, previous methods have been taking\nthe advantage of context encoding, graph embedding, or explicit relation\nreasoning to extract relation context. However, there exists inevitably\nredundant relation context due to noisy or low-quality proposals. In fact,\ninvalid relation context usually indicates underlying scene misunderstanding\nand ambiguity, which may, on the contrary, reduce the performance in complex\nscenes. Inspired by recent attention mechanism like Transformer, we propose a\nnovel 3D attention-based relation module (ARM3D). It encompasses object-aware\nrelation reasoning to extract pair-wise relation contexts among qualified\nproposals and an attention module to distribute attention weights towards\ndifferent relation contexts. In this way, ARM3D can take full advantage of the\nuseful relation context and filter those less relevant or even confusing\ncontexts, which mitigates the ambiguity in detection. We have evaluated the\neffectiveness of ARM3D by plugging it into several state-of-the-art 3D object\ndetectors and showing more accurate and robust detection results.

    "abstract": "In the wake of increasing political extremism, online platforms have been\ncriticized for contributing to polarization. One line of criticism has focused\non echo chambers and the recommended content served to users by these\nplatforms. In this work, we introduce the fair exposure problem: given limited\nintervention power of the platform, the goal is to enforce balance in the\nspread of content (e.g., news articles) among two groups of users through\nconstraints similar to those imposed by the Fairness Doctrine in the United\nStates in the past. Groups are characterized by different affiliations (e.g.,\npolitical views) and have different preferences for content. We develop a\nstylized framework that models intra- and inter-group content propagation under\nhomophily, and we formulate the platform's decision as an optimization problem\nthat aims at maximizing user engagement, potentially under fairness\nconstraints. Our main notion of fairness requires that each group see a mixture\nof their preferred and non-preferred content, encouraging information\ndiversity. Promoting such information diversity is often viewed as desirable\nand a potential means for breaking out of harmful echo chambers. We study the\nsolutions to both the fairness-agnostic and fairness-aware problems. We prove\nthat a fairness-agnostic approach inevitably leads to group-homogeneous\ntargeting by the platform. This is only partially mitigated by imposing\nfairness constraints: we show that there exist optimal fairness-aware solutions\nwhich target one group with different types of content and the other group with\nonly one type that is not necessarily the group's most preferred.

    "abstract": "Although product graphs (PGs) have gained increasing attentions in recent\nyears for their successful applications in product search and recommendations,\nthe extensive power of PGs can be limited by the inevitable involvement of\nvarious kinds of errors. Thus, it is critical to validate the correctness of\ntriples in PGs to improve their reliability. Knowledge graph (KG) embedding\nmethods have strong error detection abilities. Yet, existing KG embedding\nmethods may not be directly applicable to a PG due to its distinct\ncharacteristics: (1) PG contains rich textual signals, which necessitates a\njoint exploration of both text information and graph structure; (2) PG contains\na large number of attribute triples, in which attribute values are represented\nby free texts. Since free texts are too flexible to define entities in KGs,\ntraditional way to map entities to their embeddings using ids is no longer\nappropriate for attribute value representation; (3) Noisy triples in a PG\nmislead the embedding learning and significantly hurt the performance of error\ndetection. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose an end-to-end\nnoise-tolerant embedding learning framework, PGE, to jointly leverage both text\ninformation and graph structure in PG to learn embeddings for error detection.\nExperimental results on real-world product graph demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the proposed framework comparing with the state-of-the-art approaches.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present an innovative risk-bounded motion planning\nmethodology for stochastic multi-agent systems. For this methodology, the\ndisturbance, noise, and model uncertainty are considered; and a velocity\nobstacle method is utilized to formulate the collision-avoidance constraints in\nthe velocity space. With the exploitation of geometric information of static\nobstacles and velocity obstacles, a distributed optimization problem with\nprobabilistic chance constraints is formulated for the stochastic multi-agent\nsystem. Consequently, collision-free trajectories are generated under a\nprescribed collision risk bound. Due to the existence of probabilistic and\ndisjunctive constraints, the distributed chance-constrained optimization\nproblem is reformulated as a mixed-integer program by introducing the binary\nvariable to improve computational efficiency. This approach thus renders it\npossible to execute the motion planning task in the velocity space instead of\nthe position space, which leads to smoother collision-free trajectories for\nmulti-agent systems and higher computational efficiency. Moreover, the risk of\npotential collisions is bounded with this robust motion planning methodology.\nTo validate the effectiveness of the methodology, different scenarios for\nmultiple agents are investigated, and the simulation results clearly show that\nthe proposed approach can generate high-quality trajectories under a predefined\ncollision risk bound and avoid potential collisions effectively in the velocity\nspace.",

Brain signals, though, manifest a\nhighly complex structure that makes processing and retrieving meaningful\nfeatures challenging, particularly of abstract constructs like affect.\nMoreover, the performance of learning models is undermined by the limited\namount of available neuronal data and their severe inter-subject variability.\nIn this paper we extract efficient, personalized affective representations from\nEEG signals during music listening. To this end, we employ music signals as a\nsupervisory modality to EEG, aiming to project their semantic correspondence\nonto a common representation space. We utilize a bi-modal framework by\ncombining an LSTM-based attention model to process EEG and a pre-trained model\nfor music tagging, along with a reverse domain discriminator to align the\ndistributions of the two modalities, further constraining the learning process\nwith emotion tags. The resulting framework can be utilized for emotion\nrecognition both directly, by performing supervised predictions from either\nmodality, and indirectly, by providing relevant music samples to EEG input\nqueries.

    "abstract": "Image-guided depth completion aims to generate dense depth maps with sparse\ndepth measurements and corresponding RGB images. Currently, spatial propagation\nnetworks (SPNs) are the most popular affinity-based methods in depth\ncompletion, but they still suffer from the representation limitation of the\nfixed affinity and the over smoothing during iterations. Our solution is to\nestimate independent affinity matrices in each SPN iteration, but it is\nover-parameterized and heavy calculation. This paper introduces an efficient\nmodel that learns the affinity among neighboring pixels with an\nattention-based, dynamic approach. Specifically, the Dynamic Spatial\nPropagation Network (DySPN) we proposed makes use of a non-linear propagation\nmodel (NLPM). It decouples the neighborhood into parts regarding to different\ndistances and recursively generates independent attention maps to refine these\nparts into adaptive affinity matrices. Furthermore, we adopt a diffusion\nsuppression (DS) operation so that the model converges at an early stage to\nprevent over-smoothing of dense depth. Finally, in order to decrease the\ncomputational cost required, we also introduce three variations that reduce the\namount of neighbors and attentions needed while still retaining similar\naccuracy. In practice, our method requires less iteration to match the\nperformance of other SPNs and yields better results overall. DySPN outperforms\nother state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods on KITTI Depth Completion (DC) evaluation\nby the time of submission and is able to yield SoTA performance in NYU Depth v2\ndataset as well.",

Our novel\nclustering algorithm thus models the distributions of distances to centroids\nover a threshold by Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) in Extreme Value\nTheory (EVT). Notably, we propose the concept of centroid margin distance, use\nGPD to establish a probability model for each cluster, and perform a clustering\nalgorithm based on the covering probability function derived from GPD. Such a\nGPD k-means thus enables the clustering algorithm from the probabilistic\nperspective. Correspondingly, we also introduce a naive baseline, dubbed as\nGeneralized Extreme Value (GEV) k-means. GEV fits the distribution of the block\nmaxima. In contrast, the GPD fits the distribution of distance to the centroid\nexceeding a sufficiently large threshold, leading to a more stable performance\nof GPD k-means. Notably, GEV k-means can also estimate cluster structure and\nthus perform reasonably well over classical k-means. Thus, extensive\nexperiments on synthetic datasets and real datasets demonstrate that GPD\nk-means outperforms competitors.

    "abstract": "A shellcode is a small piece of code and it is executed to exploit a software\nvulnerability, which allows the target computer to execute arbitrary commands\nfrom the attacker through a code injection attack. Similar to the purpose of\nautomated vulnerability generation techniques, the automated generation of\nshellcode can generate attack instructions, which can be used to detect\nvulnerabilities and implement defensive measures. While the automated\nsummarization of shellcode can help users unfamiliar with shellcode and network\ninformation security understand the intent of shellcode attacks. In this study,\nwe propose a novel approach DualSC to solve the automatic shellcode generation\nand summarization tasks. Specifically, we formalize automatic shellcode\ngeneration and summarization as dual tasks, use a shallow Transformer for model\nconstruction, and design a normalization method Adjust QKNorm to adapt these\nlow-resource tasks (i.e., insufficient training data). Finally, to alleviate\nthe out-of-vocabulary problem, we propose a rulebased repair component to\nimprove the performance of automatic shellcode generation. In our empirical\nstudy, we select a highquality corpus Shellcode IA32 as our empirical subject.\nThis corpus was gathered from two real-world projects based on the line-by-line\ngranularity. We first compare DualSC with six state-of-the-art baselines from\nthe code generation and code summarization domains in terms of four performance\nmeasures. The comparison results show the competitiveness of DualSC. Then, we\nverify the effectiveness of the component setting in DualSC. Finally, we\nconduct a human study to further verify the effectiveness of DualSC.",

Our result considerably strengthens the result of Nelson and\nNguyen (ICALP, 2014), as it (1) applies only to estimating the operator norm,\nwhich can be estimated given any OSE, and (2) applies to distributions over\ngeneral linear operators $S$ which treat $A$ as a vector and compute $S(A)$,\nrather than the restricted class of linear operators corresponding to matrix\nmultiplication.

    "abstract": "Intelligent robot grasping is a very challenging task due to its inherent\ncomplexity and non availability of sufficient labelled data. Since making\nsuitable labelled data available for effective training for any deep learning\nbased model including deep reinforcement learning is so crucial for successful\ngrasp learning, in this paper we propose to solve the problem of generating\ngrasping Poses/Rectangles using a Pix2Pix Generative Adversarial Network\n(Pix2Pix GAN), which takes an image of an object as input and produces the\ngrasping rectangle tagged with the object as output. Here, we have proposed an\nend-to-end grasping rectangle generating methodology and embedding it to an\nappropriate place of an object to be grasped. We have developed two modules to\nobtain an optimal grasping rectangle. With the help of the first module, the\npose (position and orientation) of the generated grasping rectangle is\nextracted from the output of Pix2Pix GAN, and then the extracted grasp pose is\ntranslated to the centroid of the object, since here we hypothesize that like\nthe human way of grasping of regular shaped objects, the center of\nmass/centroids are the best places for stable grasping. For other irregular\nshaped objects, we allow the generated grasping rectangles as it is to be fed\nto the robot for grasp execution. The accuracy has significantly improved for\ngenerating the grasping rectangle with limited number of Cornell Grasping\nDataset augmented by our proposed approach to the extent of 87.79%. Experiments\nshow that our proposed generative model based approach gives the promising\nresults in terms of executing successful grasps for seen as well as unseen\nobjects.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies demonstrate that deep networks, even robustified by the\nstate-of-the-art adversarial training (AT), still suffer from large robust\ngeneralization gaps, in addition to the much more expensive training costs than\nstandard training. In this paper, we investigate this intriguing problem from a\nnew perspective, i.e., injecting appropriate forms of sparsity during\nadversarial training. We introduce two alternatives for sparse adversarial\ntraining: (i) static sparsity, by leveraging recent results from the lottery\nticket hypothesis to identify critical sparse subnetworks arising from the\nearly training; (ii) dynamic sparsity, by allowing the sparse subnetwork to\nadaptively adjust its connectivity pattern (while sticking to the same sparsity\nratio) throughout training. We find both static and dynamic sparse methods to\nyield win-win: substantially shrinking the robust generalization gap and\nalleviating the robust overfitting, meanwhile significantly saving training and\ninference FLOPs. Extensive experiments validate our proposals with multiple\nnetwork architectures on diverse datasets, including CIFAR-10/100 and\nTiny-ImageNet. For example, our methods reduce robust generalization gap and\noverfitting by 34.44% and 4.02%, with comparable robust/standard accuracy\nboosts and 87.83%/87.82% training/inference FLOPs savings on CIFAR-100 with\nResNet-18. Besides, our approaches can be organically combined with existing\nregularizers, establishing new state-of-the-art results in AT.

    "abstract": "In Federated Learning (FL), datasets across clients tend to be heterogeneous\nor personalized, and this poses challenges to the convergence of standard FL\nschemes that do not account for personalization. To address this, we present a\nnew approach for personalized FL that achieves exact stochastic gradient\ndescent (SGD) minimization. We start from the FedPer (Arivazhagan et al., 2019)\nneural network (NN) architecture for personalization, whereby the NN has two\ntypes of layers: the first ones are the common layers across clients, while the\nfew final ones are client-specific and are needed for personalization. We\npropose a novel SGD-type scheme where, at each optimization round, randomly\nselected clients perform gradient-descent updates over their client-specific\nweights towards optimizing the loss function on their own datasets, without\nupdating the common weights. At the final update, each client computes the\njoint gradient over both client-specific and common weights and returns the\ngradient of common parameters to the server. This allows to perform an exact\nand unbiased SGD step over the full set of parameters in a distributed manner,\ni.e. the updates of the personalized parameters are performed by the clients\nand those of the common ones by the server. Our method is superior to FedAvg\nand FedPer baselines in multi-class classification benchmarks such as Omniglot,\nCIFAR-10, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and EMNIST and has much lower computational\ncomplexity per round.",

The\nstate-of-the-art approaches involve arranging tasks in a hierarchy and\ndecoupling lower from higher priority tasks on velocity or torque level.\nVelocities and torques are elements of vector and covector spaces,\nrespectively, and thus the approaches are inherently based on linear algebra\ntools. In this paper, we develop an approach to redundancy resolution and\ndecoupling on position level. That requires moving from vector spaces and\nlinear algebra to manifolds and differential geometry. We propose to determine,\nin addition to the task forward kinematics, another set of coordinate\nfunctions. The Jacobian of those functions shall resemble the conditions known\nfrom the linear algebra-based velocity- and torque-level decoupling to the best\nextent possible. The approach provides a better insight into the topological\nproperties of robot kinematics and control problems, allowing a more global\ngeometrical view. Quasi-decoupled coordinates can help to avoid or diminish\nsome practical and theoretical difficulties related to the classical projection\napproaches at the cost of higher offline computational efforts. A condition for\nthe existence of these coordinates is derived. If the condition is not\nsatisfied, one can still find approximate solutions by numerical optimization.\nFinally, we show simulation results for both, trajectory tracking and classical\nimpedance control.",

    "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) techniques are increasingly adopted to tackle\never-evolving high-profile network attacks, including DDoS, botnet, and\nransomware, due to their unique ability to extract complex patterns hidden in\ndata streams. These approaches are however routinely validated with data\ncollected in the same environment, and their performance degrades when deployed\nin different network topologies and/or applied on previously unseen traffic, as\nwe uncover. This suggests malicious/benign behaviors are largely learned\nsuperficially and ML-based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) need\nrevisiting, to be effective in practice. In this paper we dive into the\nmechanics of large-scale network attacks, with a view to understanding how to\nuse ML for Network Intrusion Detection (NID) in a principled way. We reveal\nthat, although cyberattacks vary significantly in terms of payloads, vectors\nand targets, their early stages, which are critical to successful attack\noutcomes, share many similarities and exhibit important temporal correlations.\nTherefore, we treat NID as a time-sensitive task and propose NetSentry, perhaps\nthe first of its kind NIDS that builds on Bidirectional Asymmetric LSTM\n(Bi-ALSTM), an original ensemble of sequential neural models, to detect network\nthreats before they spread. We cross-evaluate NetSentry using two practical\ndatasets, training on one and testing on the other, and demonstrate F1 score\ngains above 33% over the state-of-the-art, as well as up to 3 times higher\nrates of detecting attacks such as XSS and web bruteforce. Further, we put\nforward a novel data augmentation technique that boosts the generalization\nabilities of a broad range of supervised deep learning algorithms, leading to\naverage F1 score gains above 35%.",

    "abstract": "The grant-free access is envisioned as one of the enablers of the\nultra-reliable low-latency communications. Yet, when there are many devices\nthat tend to be active only intermittently, the fully orthogonal resource\nallocation is largely inefficient. The solution is to employ a common, shared\npool of resources and account for the fact that some collisions and\ninterference will inevitably occur. In this contribution we study the\nreliability aspects of such multi-user uplink communication scenario over a\nshared pool of channel resources, where intermittently active devices utilize\nmultiple transmissions (K-repetition coding) to achieve diversity. We focus on\ntwo access methods -- one where devices choose the K slots at random and one\nwhere the access patterns are deterministic and follow a specific code design,\nnamely the Steiner System. We analyze the problem under two signal models that\ninvolve different complexity for the receiver. Firstly, a model which treats\ncollisions as destructive, i.e. only those K' among K transmissions that do not\ncontain interference can be used and combined. Second, where receiver is\ncapable of utilizing all K replicas and applies maximum ratio combining (MRC)\ntreating interference as noise. Furthermore, in both cases we investigate the\nreceiver with and without successive interference cancellation (SIC)\ncapabilities. As one of the main contributions of this work, we develop useful\napproximations and bounds for the outage probabilities in the aforementioned\nscenarios that match very closely the simulation results. We also show that\ndeterministic patterns have the potential to significantly outperform fully\nrandom selection, both in terms of raw performance and by simplifying the\nsystem design.",

The proposed SLR-SOA approach introduces a novel autoencoder\nmodel, SOA, that is designed to learn a representation domain where the data\nare sparsely represented. Moreover, the network composes of 1D-operational\nlayers with the non-linear neuron model. Hence, the learning capability of\nneurons (filters) is greatly improved with shallow architectures. Using compact\narchitectures is especially crucial in autoencoders as they tend to overfit\neasily because of their identity mapping objective. Overall, we show that the\nproposed SRL-SOA band selection approach outperforms the competing methods over\ntwo HSI data including Indian Pines and Salinas-A considering the achieved land\ncover classification accuracies. The software implementation of the SRL-SOA\napproach is shared publicly at https://github.com/meteahishali/SRL-SOA.",

In safety-critical applications, a human\nsupervisor may want to verify that the plan is indeed collision-free. To this\nend, a recent work introduces a notion of explainability for MAPF based on a\nvisualization of the plan as a short sequence of images representing time\nsegments, where in each time segment the trajectories of the agents are\ndisjoint. Then, the explainable MAPF problem asks for a set of non-colliding\npaths that admits a short-enough explanation. Explainable MAPF adds a new\ndifficulty to MAPF, in that it is NP-hard with respect to the size of the\nenvironment, and not just the number of agents. Thus, traditional MAPF\nalgorithms are not equipped to directly handle explainable-MAPF. In this work,\nwe adapt Conflict Based Search (CBS), a well-studied algorithm for MAPF, to\nhandle explainable MAPF. We show how to add explainability constraints on top\nof the standard CBS tree and its underlying A* search.

We\nfind that profiles can yield new insights into the structure of both models and\ndata -- in and out-of-distribution. For example, we empirically show that real\ndata distributions consist of points with qualitatively different profiles.

    "abstract": "Siamese trackers perform similarity matching with templates (i.e., target\nmodels) to recursively localize objects within a search region. Several\nstrategies have been proposed in the literature to update a template based on\nthe tracker output, typically extracted from the target search region in the\ncurrent frame, and thereby mitigate the effects of target drift. However, this\nmay lead to corrupted templates, limiting the potential benefits of a template\nupdate strategy.\nThis paper proposes a model adaptation method for Siamese trackers that uses\na generative model to produce a synthetic template from the object search\nregions of several previous frames, rather than directly using the tracker\noutput. Since the search region encompasses the target, attention from the\nsearch region is used for robust model adaptation. In particular, our approach\nrelies on an auto-encoder trained through adversarial learning to detect\nchanges in a target object's appearance and predict a future target template,\nusing a set of target templates localized from tracker outputs at previous\nframes. To prevent template corruption during the update, the proposed tracker\nalso performs change detection using the generative model to suspend updates\nuntil the tracker stabilizes, and robust matching can resume through dynamic\ntemplate fusion.\nExtensive experiments conducted on VOT-16, VOT-17, OTB-50, and OTB-100\ndatasets highlight the effectiveness of our method, along with the impact of\nits key components.

In the literature, researchers\nhave explored various techniques to test, analyze, and verify DL models, since\ntheir quality directly affects the corresponding system behaviors. Recently,\nresearchers have also proposed novel techniques for testing the underlying\noperator-level DL libraries (such as TensorFlow and PyTorch), which provide\ngeneral binary implementations for each high-level DL operator for running\nvarious DL models on many platforms. However, there is still limited work\ntargeting the reliability of the emerging tensor compilers, which aim to\ndirectly compile high-level tensor computation graphs into high-performance\nbinaries for better efficiency, portability, and scalability. In this paper, we\ntarget the important problem of tensor compiler testing, and have proposed\nTzer, a practical fuzzing technique for the widely used TVM tensor compiler.\nTzer focuses on mutating the low-level Intermediate Representation (IR) for TVM\ndue to the limited mutation space for the high-level IR. More specifically,\nTzer leverages both general-purpose and tensor-compiler-specific mutators\nguided by coverage feedback for evolutionary IR mutation; furthermore, Tzer\nalso performs pass mutation in tandem with IR mutation for more effective\nfuzzing. Our results show that Tzer substantially outperforms existing fuzzing\ntechniques on tensor compiler testing, with 75% higher coverage and 50% more\nvaluable tests than the 2nd-best technique. To date, Tzer has detected 49\npreviously unknown bugs for TVM, with 37 bugs confirmed and 25 bugs fixed (PR\nmerged).",

    "abstract": "The text-based speech editor allows the editing of speech through intuitive\ncutting, copying, and pasting operations to speed up the process of editing\nspeech. However, the major drawback of current systems is that edited speech\noften sounds unnatural due to cut-copy-paste operation. In addition, it is not\nobvious how to synthesize records according to a new word not appearing in the\ntranscript. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end text-based speech editing\nmethod called context-aware mask prediction network (CampNet). The model can\nsimulate the text-based speech editing process by randomly masking part of\nspeech and then predicting the masked region by sensing the speech context. It\ncan solve unnatural prosody in the edited region and synthesize the speech\ncorresponding to the unseen words in the transcript. Secondly, for the possible\noperation of text-based speech editing, we design three text-based operations\nbased on CampNet: deletion, insertion, and replacement. These operations can\ncover various situations of speech editing. Thirdly, to synthesize the speech\ncorresponding to long text in insertion and replacement operations, a\nword-level autoregressive generation method is proposed. Fourthly, we propose a\nspeaker adaptation method using only one sentence for CampNet and explore the\nability of few-shot learning based on CampNet, which provides a new idea for\nspeech forgery tasks. The subjective and objective experiments on VCTK and\nLibriTTS datasets show that the speech editing results based on CampNet are\nbetter than TTS technology, manual editing, and VoCo method. We also conduct\ndetailed ablation experiments to explore the effect of the CampNet structure on\nits performance. Finally, the experiment shows that speaker adaptation with\nonly one sentence can further improve the naturalness of speech.

    "abstract": "The complementary fusion of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data and\nimage data is a promising but challenging task for generating high-precision\nand high-density point clouds. This study proposes an innovative LiDAR-guided\nstereo matching approach called LiDAR-guided stereo matching (LGSM), which\nconsiders the spatial consistency represented by continuous disparity or depth\nchanges in the homogeneous region of an image. The LGSM first detects the\nhomogeneous pixels of each LiDAR projection point based on their color or\nintensity similarity. Next, we propose a riverbed enhancement function to\noptimize the cost volume of the LiDAR projection points and their homogeneous\npixels to improve the matching robustness. Our formulation expands the\nconstraint scopes of sparse LiDAR projection points with the guidance of image\ninformation to optimize the cost volume of pixels as much as possible. We\napplied LGSM to semi-global matching and AD-Census on both simulated and real\ndatasets. When the percentage of LiDAR points in the simulated datasets was\n0.16%, the matching accuracy of our method achieved a subpixel level, while\nthat of the original stereo matching algorithm was 3.4 pixels. The experimental\nresults show that LGSM is suitable for indoor, street, aerial, and satellite\nimage datasets and provides good transferability across semi-global matching\nand AD-Census. Furthermore, the qualitative and quantitative evaluations\ndemonstrate that LGSM is superior to two state-of-the-art optimizing cost\nvolume methods, especially in reducing mismatches in difficult matching areas\nand refining the boundaries of objects.",

    "abstract": "Cross-slide image analysis provides additional information by analysing the\nexpression of different biomarkers as compared to a single slide analysis.\nSlides stained with different biomarkers are analysed side by side which may\nreveal unknown relations between the different biomarkers. During the slide\npreparation, a tissue section may be placed at an arbitrary orientation as\ncompared to other sections of the same tissue block. The problem is compounded\nby the fact that tissue contents are likely to change from one section to the\nnext and there may be unique artefacts on some of the slides. This makes\nregistration of each section to a reference section of the same tissue block an\nimportant pre-requisite task before any cross-slide analysis. We propose a deep\nfeature based registration (DFBR) method which utilises data-driven features to\nestimate the rigid transformation. We adopted a multi-stage strategy for\nimproving the quality of registration. We also developed a visualisation tool\nto view registered pairs of WSIs at different magnifications. With the help of\nthis tool, one can apply a transformation on the fly without the need to\ngenerate transformed source WSI in a pyramidal form. We compared the\nperformance of data-driven features with that of hand-crafted features on the\nCOMET dataset. Our approach can align the images with low registration errors.\nGenerally, the success of non-rigid registration is dependent on the quality of\nrigid registration.

    "abstract": "Modeling stochastic traffic dynamics is critical to developing self-driving\ncars. Because it is difficult to develop first principle models of cars driven\nby humans, there is great potential for using data driven approaches in\ndeveloping traffic dynamical models. While there is extensive literature on\nthis subject, previous works mainly address the prediction accuracy of\ndata-driven models. Moreover, it is often difficult to apply these models to\ncommon planning frameworks since they fail to meet the assumptions therein. In\nthis work, we propose a new stochastic traffic model, Recurrent Traffic Graph\nNeural Network (RTGNN), by enforcing additional structures on the model so that\nthe proposed model can be seamlessly integrated with existing motion planning\nalgorithms. RTGNN is a Markovian model and is able to infer future traffic\nstates conditioned on the motion of the ego vehicle. Specifically, RTGNN uses a\ndefinition of the traffic state that includes the state of all players in a\nlocal region and is therefore able to make joint predictions for all agents of\ninterest. Meanwhile, we explicitly model the hidden states of agents,\n\"intentions,\" as part of the traffic state to reflect the inherent partial\nobservability of traffic dynamics.

Our AVSD model with its Transformer-based feature attains\nhigher objective performance scores for answer generation. In addition, our\nmodel achieves a subjective score close to that of human answers in DSTC10.

Recently, data\naugmentation techniques aiming at enhancing data diversity have demonstrated\nproven performance in improving the generalization ability of learned policies.\nHowever, due to the sensitivity of RL training, naively applying data\naugmentation, which transforms each pixel in a task-agnostic manner, may suffer\nfrom instability and damage the sample efficiency, thus further exacerbating\nthe generalization performance. At the heart of this phenomenon is the diverged\naction distribution and high-variance value estimation in the face of augmented\nimages. To alleviate this issue, we propose Task-aware Lipschitz Data\nAugmentation (TLDA) for visual RL, which explicitly identifies the\ntask-correlated pixels with large Lipschitz constants, and only augments the\ntask-irrelevant pixels. To verify the effectiveness of TLDA, we conduct\nextensive experiments on DeepMind Control suite, CARLA and DeepMind\nManipulation tasks, showing that TLDA improves both sample efficiency in\ntraining time and generalization in test time.

    "abstract": "Unstructured environments are difficult for autonomous driving. This is\nbecause various unknown obstacles are lied in drivable space without lanes, and\nits width and curvature change widely. In such complex environments, searching\nfor a path in real-time is difficult. Also, inaccurate localization data reduce\nthe path tracking accuracy, increasing the risk of collision. Instead of\nsearching and tracking the path, an alternative approach has been proposed that\nreactively avoids obstacles in real-time. Some methods are available for\ntracking global path while avoiding obstacles using the candidate paths and the\nartificial potential field. However, these methods require heuristics to find\nspecific parameters for handling various complex environments. In addition, it\nis difficult to track the global path accurately in practice because of\ninaccurate localization data. If the drivable space is not accurately\nrecognized (i.e., noisy state), the vehicle may not smoothly drive or may\ncollide with obstacles. In this study, a method in which the vehicle drives\ntoward drivable space only using a vision-based occupancy grid map is proposed.\nThe proposed method uses imitation learning, where a deep neural network is\ntrained with expert driving data.

However, a prior study found that laypeople did not\nunderstand the data perturbation processes of DP and how DP noise protects\ntheir sensitive personal information. Consequently, they distrusted the\ntechniques and chose to opt out of participating. In this project, we designed\nexplanative illustrations of three DP models (Central DP, Local DP, Shuffler\nDP) to help laypeople conceptualize how random noise is added to protect\nindividuals' privacy and preserve group utility. Following pilot surveys and\ninterview studies, we conducted two online experiments (N = 595) examining\nparticipants' comprehension, privacy and utility perception, and data-sharing\ndecisions across the three DP models. Besides the comparisons across the three\nmodels, we varied the noise levels of each model. We found that the\nillustrations can be effective in communicating DP to the participants. Given\nan adequate comprehension of DP, participants preferred strong privacy\nprotection for a certain type of data usage scenarios (i.e., commercial\ninterests) at both the model level and the noise level.

To do so, coefficients are hidden among decoys, which are selected\nbeyond possible values of coefficients using three alternative methods.

    "abstract": "There has been a long-standing interest in computing diverse solutions to\noptimization problems. Motivated by reallocation of governmental institutions\nin Sweden, in 1995 J. Krarup posed the problem of finding $k$ edge-disjoint\nHamiltonian Circuits of minimum total weight, called the peripatetic salesman\nproblem (PSP). Since then researchers have investigated the complexity of\nfinding diverse solutions to spanning trees, paths, vertex covers, matchings,\nand more. Unlike the PSP that has a constraint on the total weight of the\nsolutions, recent work has involved finding diverse solutions that are all\noptimal.\nHowever, sometimes the space of exact solutions may be too small to achieve\nsufficient diversity. Motivated by this, we initiate the study of obtaining\nsufficiently-diverse, yet approximately-optimal solutions to optimization\nproblems. Formally, given an integer $k$, an approximation factor $c$, and an\ninstance $I$ of an optimization problem, we aim to obtain a set of $k$\nsolutions to $I$ that a) are all $c$ approximately-optimal for $I$ and b)\nmaximize the diversity of the $k$ solutions. Finding such solutions, therefore,\nrequires a better understanding of the global landscape of the optimization\nfunction.\nWe show that, given any metric on the space of solutions, and the diversity\nmeasure as the sum of pairwise distances between solutions, this problem can be\nsolved by combining ideas from dispersion and multicriteria optimization. We\nfirst provide a general reduction to an associated budget-constrained\noptimization (BCO) problem, where one objective function is to be maximized\n(minimized) subject to a bound on the second objective function. We then prove\nthat bi-approximations to the BCO can be used to give bi-approximations to the\ndiverse approximately optimal solutions problem with a little overhead.",

Existing\nmethods only process sentences independently, without considering the\ndomain-level relationship between sentences, and fail to provide effective\nsolutions to the problem of class-imbalance.

We introduce a new open-source framework\nfor systematic reviews that significantly reduces time and human resource\nallocation for collecting and screening scientific literature. The framework\nprovides three main tools: 1) an automatic citation search engine and manager\nthat collects records from multiple online sources with a unified query syntax,\n2) a Bayesian, active machine learning, citation screening tool based on\niterative human-machine interaction to increase predictive accuracy and, 3) a\nsemi-automatic, data-driven query generator to create new search queries from\nexisting citation data sets. To evaluate the automatic screener's performance,\nwe estimated the median posterior sensitivity and efficiency [90% Credible\nIntervals] using Bayesian simulation to predict the distribution of undetected\npotentially relevant records. Tested on an example topic, the framework\ncollected 17,755 unique records through the citation manager; 766 records\nrequired human evaluation while the rest were excluded by the automatic\nclassifier; the theoretical efficiency was 95.6% [95.3%, 95.7%] with a\nsensitivity of 100% [93.5%, 100%]. A new search query was generated from the\nlabelled dataset, and 82,579 additional records were collected; only 567\nrecords required human review after automatic screening, and six additional\npositive matches were found. The overall expected sensitivity decreased to\n97.3% [73.8%, 100%] while the efficiency increased to 98.6% [98.2%, 98.7%]. For\nlarge studies, the framework can significantly reduce the human resources\nrequired to conduct literature reviews by simplifying citation collection and\nscreening while demonstrating exceptional sensitivity.

Existing visual attention models, such as Deep Spatial Autoencoders,\nhave improved the data-efficiency by training the model to selectively extract\nonly the task relevant image area. However, since the models are unable to\nselect attention targets on demand, the diversity of trainable tasks are\nlimited.

Such structure is capable of incorporating\nexternal inputs to create the Query, which will be trained to represent the\ntarget objects. The separation of Query creation improved the model's\nflexibility, enabling to simultaneously obtain and switch between multiple\ntargets in a top-down manner.

    "abstract": "The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology is a promising\nenabler for millimeter wave (mmWave) wireless communications, as it can\npotentially provide spectral efficiency comparable to the conventional massive\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) but with significantly lower hardware\ncomplexity. In this paper, we focus on the estimation and projection of the\nuplink RIS-aided massive MIMO channel, which can be time-varying. We propose to\nlet the user equipments (UE) transmit Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences and let the\nbase station (BS) conduct maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of the uplink\nchannel. The proposed scheme is computationally efficient: it uses ZC sequences\nto decouple the estimation of the frequency and time offsets; it uses the\nspace-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) method to reduce\nthe high-dimensional problem due to the multipaths to multiple\nlower-dimensional ones per path. Owing to the estimation of the Doppler\nfrequency offsets, the time-varying channel state can be projected, which can\nsignificantly lower the overhead of the pilots for channel estimation. The\nnumerical simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",

As the Light Detection And Range (LiDAR) sensor is widely used in the\nautonomous car, fast semantic segmentation of LiDAR point cloud, which is the\npoint-wise classification of the point cloud within the sensor framerate, has\nattracted attention in recognition of the driving environment. Although the\nvoxel and fusion-based semantic segmentation models are the state-of-the-art\nmodel in point cloud semantic segmentation recently, their real-time\nperformance suffer from high computational load due to high voxel resolution.\nIn this paper, we propose the fast voxel-based semantic segmentation model\nusing Point Convolution and 3D Sparse Convolution (PCSCNet).

    "abstract": "When transferring a pretrained model to a downstream task, two popular\nmethods are full fine-tuning (updating all the model parameters) and linear\nprobing (updating only the last linear layer -- the \"head\"). It is well known\nthat fine-tuning leads to better accuracy in-distribution (ID). However, in\nthis paper, we find that fine-tuning can achieve worse accuracy than linear\nprobing out-of-distribution (OOD) when the pretrained features are good and the\ndistribution shift is large. On 10 distribution shift datasets\n(Breeds-Living17, Breeds-Entity30, DomainNet, CIFAR $\\to$ STL, CIFAR10.1, FMoW,\nImageNetV2, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-A, ImageNet-Sketch), fine-tuning obtains on\naverage 2% higher accuracy ID but 7% lower accuracy OOD than linear probing. We\nshow theoretically that this tradeoff between ID and OOD accuracy arises even\nin a simple setting: fine-tuning overparameterized two-layer linear networks.\nWe prove that the OOD error of fine-tuning is high when we initialize with a\nfixed or random head -- this is because while fine-tuning learns the head, the\nlower layers of the neural network change simultaneously and distort the\npretrained features. Our analysis suggests that the easy two-step strategy of\nlinear probing then full fine-tuning (LP-FT), sometimes used as a fine-tuning\nheuristic, combines the benefits of both fine-tuning and linear probing.\nEmpirically, LP-FT outperforms both fine-tuning and linear probing on the above\ndatasets (1% better ID, 10% better OOD than full fine-tuning).",

Finally, we also induce unsupervised multilingual sentence\nembeddings from pseudo-parallel data.

    "abstract": "Crowdsourcing has become an important tool to collect data for various\nartificial intelligence applications and auction can be an effective way to\nallocate work and determine reward in a crowdsourcing platform. In this paper,\nwe focus on the crowdsourcing of small tasks such as image labelling and voice\nrecording where we face a number of challenges. First, workers have different\nlimits on the amount of work they would be willing to do, and they may also\nmisreport these limits in their bid for work. Secondly, if the auction is\nrepeated over time, unsuccessful workers may drop out of the system, reducing\ncompetition and diversity. To tackle these issues, we first extend the results\nof the celebrated Myerson's optimal auction mechanism for a single-parameter\nbid to the case where the bid consists of the unit cost of work, the maximum\namount of work one is willing to do, and the actual work completed. We show\nthat a simple payment mechanism is sufficient to ensure a dominant strategy\nfrom the workers, and that this dominant strategy is robust to the true utility\nfunction of the workers. Secondly, we propose a novel, flexible work allocation\nmechanism, which allows the requester to balance between cost efficiency and\nequality. While cost minimization is obviously important, encouraging equality\nin the allocation of work increases the diversity of the workforce as well as\npromotes long-term participation on the crowdsourcing platform.

Unlike\ndigitization, digitalization is a transformation to improve processes by\nleveraging digital technologies and digitized data. The cyberspace has evolved\nfrom a hardware internetworking infrastructure to the notion of a virtual\nenvironment, transforming how people, business and government interact and\noperate. Through this transformation, lots of personal data are captured which\nindividuals have no ownership or control over, threatening their privacy. It is\ntherefore necessary for the data owners to have control over the ownership,\ncustody and utilization of their data and to protect one's digital assets and\nidentity through proper data governance, cybersecurity control and privacy\nprotection.

This paper\nfirst explains these two concepts in terms of their guiding principles, laws\nand regulations requirements, and analyse and discuss the technical challenges\nof implementing these requirements.

The integration of prosumers and\naccommodation of incurred bidirectional flows of energy and information rely on\ntwo key factors: flexible structures of energy markets and intelligent\noperations of power systems. The blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI)\nare innovative technologies to fulfil these two factors, by which the\nblockchain provides decentralised trading platforms for energy markets and the\nAI supports the optimal operational control of power systems. This paper\nattempts to address how to incorporate the blockchain and AI in the smart grids\nfor facilitating prosumers to participate in energy markets. To achieve this\nobjective, first, this paper reviews how policy designs price carbon emissions\ncaused by the fossil-fuel based generation so as to facilitate the integration\nof prosumers with renewable energy sources. Second, the potential structures of\nenergy markets with the support of the blockchain technologies are discussed.\nLast, how to apply the AI for enhancing the state monitoring and decision\nmaking during the operations of power systems is introduced.",

One\nkey problem underlying the training of deep neural networks is the immanent\nlack of a sufficient amount of training data. The problem worsens especially if\nlabels cannot be generated automatically, but have to be annotated manually.\nThis challenge occurs for instance if expert knowledge related to 3D parts\nshould be externalized based on example models. One way to reduce the necessary\namount of labeled data may be the use of autoencoders, which can be learned in\nan unsupervised fashion without labeled data. In this work, we present a deep\nresidual 3D autoencoder based on the EfficientNet architecture, intended for\ntransfer learning tasks related to 3D CAD model assessment. For this purpose,\nwe adopted EfficientNet to 3D problems like voxel models derived from a STEP\nfile.

    "abstract": "Deep Learning (DL) has shown impressive performance in many mobile\napplications. Most existing works have focused on reducing the computational\nand resource overheads of running Deep Neural Networks (DNN) inference on\nresource-constrained mobile devices. However, the other aspect of DNN\noperations, i.e. training (forward and backward passes) on smartphone GPUs, has\nreceived little attention thus far. To this end, we conduct an initial analysis\nto examine the feasibility of on-device training on smartphones using mobile\nGPUs. We first employ the open-source mobile DL framework (MNN) and its OpenCL\nbackend for running compute kernels on GPUs. Next, we observed that training on\nCPUs is much faster than on GPUs and identified two possible bottlenecks\nrelated to this observation: (i) computation and (ii) memory bottlenecks. To\nsolve the computation bottleneck, we optimize the OpenCL backend's kernels,\nshowing 2x improvements (40-70 GFLOPs) over CPUs (15-30 GFLOPs) on the\nSnapdragon 8 series processors. However, we find that the full DNN training is\nstill much slower on GPUs than on CPUs, indicating that memory bottleneck plays\na significant role in the lower performance of GPU over CPU. The data movement\ntakes almost 91% of training time due to the low bandwidth. Lastly, based on\nthe findings and failures during our investigation, we present limitations and\npractical guidelines for future directions.",

Therefore,\nstate-of-the-art models need the ability of lifelong learning in order to\nimprove performance as soon as new data are available - without the need of\nretraining the whole model from scratch.

    "abstract": "Vision transformers have shown great potential in various computer vision\ntasks owing to their strong capability to model long-range dependency using the\nself-attention mechanism. Nevertheless, they treat an image as a 1D sequence of\nvisual tokens, lacking an intrinsic inductive bias (IB) in modeling local\nvisual structures and dealing with scale variance, which is instead learned\nimplicitly from large-scale training data with longer training schedules. In\nthis paper, we propose a Vision Transformer Advanced by Exploring intrinsic IB\nfrom convolutions, i.e., ViTAE. Technically, ViTAE has several spatial pyramid\nreduction modules to downsample and embed the input image into tokens with rich\nmulti-scale context using multiple convolutions with different dilation rates.\nIn this way, it acquires an intrinsic scale invariance IB and can learn robust\nfeature representation for objects at various scales. Moreover, in each\ntransformer layer, ViTAE has a convolution block parallel to the multi-head\nself-attention module, whose features are fused and fed into the feed-forward\nnetwork. Consequently, it has the intrinsic locality IB and is able to learn\nlocal features and global dependencies collaboratively. The proposed two kinds\nof cells are stacked in both isotropic and multi-stage manners to formulate two\nfamilies of ViTAE models, i.e., the vanilla ViTAE and ViTAEv2. Experiments on\nthe ImageNet dataset as well as downstream tasks on the MS COCO, ADE20K, and\nAP10K datasets validate the superiority of our models over the baseline\ntransformer models and concurrent works. Besides, we scale up our ViTAE model\nto 644M parameters and obtain the state-of-the-art classification performance,\ni.e., 88.5% Top-1 classification accuracy on ImageNet validation set and the\nbest 91.2% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet real validation set, without using extra\nprivate data.",

The segmentation framework generally consists of two stages: smoothing\nand thresholding, thus referred to as SaT.

Convergence of the ADMM algorithm is analyzed. In the second\nstage, we threshold the smoothed image by $k$-means clustering to obtain the\nfinal segmentation result. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed\nsegmentation framework is versatile for both grayscale and color images,\nefficient in producing high-quality segmentation results within a few seconds,\nand robust to input images that are corrupted with noise, blur, or both.

    "abstract": "In cooperative multi-agent tasks, a team of agents jointly interact with an\nenvironment by taking actions, receiving a team reward and observing the next\nstate. During the interactions, the uncertainty of environment and reward will\ninevitably induce stochasticity in the long-term returns and the randomness can\nbe exacerbated with the increasing number of agents. However, most of the\nexisting value-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods only\nmodel the expectations of individual Q-values and global Q-value, ignoring such\nrandomness. Compared to the expectations of the long-term returns, it is more\npreferable to directly model the stochasticity by estimating the returns\nthrough distributions. With this motivation, this work proposes DQMIX, a novel\nvalue-based MARL method, from a distributional perspective. Specifically, we\nmodel each individual Q-value with a categorical distribution. To integrate\nthese individual Q-value distributions into the global Q-value distribution, we\ndesign a distribution mixing network, based on five basic operations on the\ndistribution. We further prove that DQMIX satisfies the\n\\emph{Distributional-Individual-Global-Max} (DIGM) principle with respect to\nthe expectation of distribution, which guarantees the consistency between joint\nand individual greedy action selections in the global Q-value and individual\nQ-values. To validate DQMIX, we demonstrate its ability to factorize a matrix\ngame with stochastic rewards. Furthermore, the experimental results on a\nchallenging set of StarCraft II micromanagement tasks show that DQMIX\nconsistently outperforms the value-based multi-agent reinforcement learning\nbaselines.",

It is clinically approved to thermally ablate\nregions of the thalamus and is being explored for other therapies, such as\nblood brain barrier opening and neuromodulation. To accurately target\nultrasound through the skull, the transmitted waves must constructively\ninterfere at the target region. However, heterogeneity of the sound speed,\ndensity, and ultrasound attenuation in different individuals' skulls requires\npatient-specific estimates of these parameters for optimal treatment planning.\nCT imaging is currently the gold standard for estimating acoustic properties of\nan individual skull during clinical procedures, but CT imaging exposes patients\nto radiation and increases the overall number of imaging procedures required\nfor therapy. A method to estimate acoustic parameters in the skull without the\nneed for CT would be desirable.

    "title": "Dynamic Relation Repairing for Knowledge Enhancement",
    "abstract": "Dynamic relation repair aims to efficiently validate and repair the instances\nfor knowledge graph enhancement (KGE), where KGE captures missing relations\nfrom unstructured data and leads to noisy facts to the knowledge graph. With\nthe prosperity of unstructured data, an online approach is asked to clean the\nnew RDF tuples before adding them to the knowledge base. To clean the noisy RDF\ntuples, graph constraint processing is a common but intractable approach. Plus,\nwhen adding new tuples to the knowledge graph, new graph patterns would be\ncreated, whereas the explicit discovery of graph constraints is also\nintractable. Therefore, although the dynamic relation repair has an unfortunate\nhardness, it is a necessary approach for enhancing knowledge graphs effectively\nunder the fast-growing unstructured data. Motivated by this, we establish a\ndynamic repairing and enhancing structure to analyze its hardness on basic\noperations. To ensure dynamic repair and validation, we introduce implicit\ngraph constraints, approximate graph matching, and linkage prediction based on\nlocalized graph patterns. To validate and repair the RDF tuples efficiently, we\nfurther study the cold start problems for graph constraint processing.\nExperimental results on real datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach\ncan capture and repair instances with wrong relation labels dynamically and\neffectively.",

    "abstract": "Network structures play important roles in social, technological and\nbiological systems. However, the observable nodes and connections in real cases\nare often incomplete or unavailable due to measurement errors, private\nprotection issues, or other problems. Therefore, inferring the complete network\nstructure is useful for understanding human interactions and complex dynamics.\nThe existing studies have not fully solved the problem of inferring network\nstructure with partial information about connections or nodes. In this paper,\nwe tackle the problem by utilizing time-series data generated by network\ndynamics. We regard the network inference problem based on dynamical time\nseries data as a problem of minimizing errors for predicting states of\nobservable nodes and proposed a novel data-driven deep learning model called\nGumbel-softmax Inference for Network (GIN) to solve the problem under\nincomplete information. The GIN framework includes three modules: a dynamics\nlearner, a network generator, and an initial state generator to infer the\nunobservable parts of the network. We implement experiments on artificial and\nempirical social networks with discrete and continuous dynamics. The\nexperiments show that our method can infer the unknown parts of the structure\nand the initial states of the observable nodes with up to 90\\% accuracy. The\naccuracy declines linearly with the increase of the fractions of unobservable\nnodes. Our framework may have wide applications where the network structure is\nhard to obtain and the time series data is rich.",

The sender chooses\nsignals to maximize its own utility function while the receiver aims to\nascertain the value of a source that is privately known to the sender. It is\nwell known that such sender-receiver games admit a vast number of equilibria\nand not all signals from the sender can be relied on as truthful. Our main\ncontribution is an exact characterization of the minimum number of distinct\nsource symbols that can be correctly recovered by a receiver in \\textit{any}\nequilibrium of this game; we call this quantity the \\textit{informativeness} of\nthe sender. We show that the informativeness is given by the \\textit{vertex\nclique cover number} of a certain graph induced by the utility function,\nwhereby it can be computed based on the utility function alone without the need\nto enumerate all equilibria. We find that informativeness characterizes the\nexistence of well-known classes of separating, pooling and semi-separating\nequilibria.

    "abstract": "Modeling the preferences of agents over a set of alternatives is a principal\nconcern in many areas. The dominant approach has been to find a single\nreward/utility function with the property that alternatives yielding higher\nrewards are preferred over alternatives yielding lower rewards. However, in\nmany settings, preferences are based on multiple, often competing, objectives;\na single reward function is not adequate to represent such preferences. This\npaper proposes a method for inferring multi-objective reward-based\nrepresentations of an agent's observed preferences. We model the agent's\npriorities over different objectives as entering lexicographically, so that\nobjectives with lower priorities matter only when the agent is indifferent with\nrespect to objectives with higher priorities.

The first step is to\ngenerate an artificial dataset from the original set of levels by introducing\nmany different sequences of mutations to existing levels. In the generated\ndataset, features are observations of destroyed levels and targets are the\nspecific actions that repair the mutated tile in the middle of the\nobservations. Using this dataset, a convolutional network is trained to map\nfrom observations to their respective appropriate repair actions. The trained\nnetwork is then used to iteratively produce levels from random starting states.\nWe demonstrate this method by applying it to generate unique and playable\ntile-based levels for several 2D games (Zelda, Danger Dave, and Sokoban) and\nvary key hyperparameters.",

    "title": "Analytic Solutions for Wheeled Mobile Manipulator Supporting Forces",
    "abstract": "When a mobile manipulator's wheel loses contact with the ground, tipping-over\nmay occur, causing material damage, and in the worst case, it can put human\nlives in danger. The tip-over stability of wheeled mobile manipulators must not\nbe overlooked at any stage of a mobile manipulator's life, starting from the\ndesign phase, continuing through the commissioning period and extending to the\noperational phase. Many tip-over stability criteria formulated throughout the\nyears do not explicitly consider the normal wheel loads, with most of them\nrelying on prescribed stability margins in terms of overturning moments. In\nthese formulations, it is commonly argued that overturning will occur about one\nof the axes connecting adjacent manipulator's contact points with the ground.\nThis claim may not always be valid and is certainly restrictive. Explicit\nexpressions for the manipulator supporting forces provide the best insight into\nrelevant affecting terms which contribute to the tip-over (in)stability. They\nalso remove the necessity for thinking about which axis the manipulator could\ntip over and simultaneously enable the formulation of more intuitive stability\nmargins and on-line tip-over prevention techniques. The present study presents\na general dynamics modelling approach in the Newton--Euler framework using 6D\nvectors and gives normal wheel load equations in a typical 4-wheeled mobile\nmanipulator negotiating a slope. The given expressions are expected to become\nstandard in wheeled mobile manipulators and to provide a basis for effective\ntip-over stability criteria and tip-over avoidance techniques. Based on the\npresented results, specific improvements of the state-of-the-art criteria are\ndiscussed.",

    "abstract": "Although previous CNN based face anti-spoofing methods have achieved\npromising performance under intra-dataset testing, they suffer from poor\ngeneralization under cross-dataset testing. The main reason is that they learn\nthe network with only binary supervision, which may learn arbitrary cues\noverfitting on the training dataset. To make the learned feature explainable\nand more generalizable, some researchers introduce facial depth and reflection\nmap as the auxiliary supervision. However, many other generalizable cues are\nunexplored for face anti-spoofing, which limits their performance under\ncross-dataset testing. To this end, we propose a novel framework to learn\nmultiple explainable and generalizable cues (MEGC) for face anti-spoofing.\nSpecifically, inspired by the process of human decision, four mainly used cues\nby humans are introduced as auxiliary supervision including the boundary of\nspoof medium, moir\\'e pattern, reflection artifacts and facial depth in\naddition to the binary supervision. To avoid extra labelling cost,\ncorresponding synthetic methods are proposed to generate these auxiliary\nsupervision maps. Extensive experiments on public datasets validate the\neffectiveness of these cues, and state-of-the-art performances are achieved by\nour proposed method.",

Existing CL approaches often keep a buffer of\npreviously-seen samples, perform knowledge distillation, or use regularization\ntechniques towards this goal.

To ameliorate\nthis problem, we propose to only activate and select sparse neurons for\nlearning current and past tasks at any stage.

Full\nExperience Replay (FER) provides effective supervision in learning the sparse\nactivations of the neurons in different layers.

Our approach is\ntext-independent and does not place any restrictions on the size of the input\nword images under consideration. To begin with, we employ the SIFT algorithm to\nextract multiple key points at various levels of abstraction (comprising\nallograph, character, or combination of characters). These key points are then\npassed through a trained CNN network to generate feature maps corresponding to\na convolution layer. However, owing to the scale corresponding to the SIFT key\npoints, the size of a generated feature map may differ. As an alleviation to\nthis issue, the histogram of gradients is applied on the feature map to produce\na fixed representation. Typically, in a CNN, the number of filters of each\nconvolution block increase depending on the depth of the network. Thus,\nextracting histogram features for each of the convolution feature map increase\nthe dimension as well as the computational load. To address this aspect, we use\nan entropy-based method to learn the weights of the feature maps of a\nparticular CNN layer during the training phase of our algorithm.

    "title": "Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search under Neural Similarity Metric for  Large-Scale Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Model-based methods for recommender systems have been studied extensively for\nyears. Modern recommender systems usually resort to 1) representation learning\nmodels which define user-item preference as the distance between their\nembedding representations, and 2) embedding-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor\n(ANN) search to tackle the efficiency problem introduced by large-scale corpus.\nWhile providing efficient retrieval, the embedding-based retrieval pattern also\nlimits the model capacity since the form of user-item preference measure is\nrestricted to the distance between their embedding representations. However,\nfor other more precise user-item preference measures, e.g., preference scores\ndirectly derived from a deep neural network, they are computationally\nintractable because of the lack of an efficient retrieval method, and an\nexhaustive search for all user-item pairs is impractical. In this paper, we\npropose a novel method to extend ANN search to arbitrary matching functions,\ne.g., a deep neural network. Our main idea is to perform a greedy walk with a\nmatching function in a similarity graph constructed from all items. To solve\nthe problem that the similarity measures of graph construction and user-item\nmatching function are heterogeneous, we propose a pluggable adversarial\ntraining task to ensure the graph search with arbitrary matching function can\nachieve fairly high precision. Experimental results in both open source and\nindustry datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The proposed\nmethod has been fully deployed in the Taobao display advertising platform and\nbrings a considerable advertising revenue increase. We also summarize our\ndetailed experiences in deployment in this paper.",

    "abstract": "Cross-modal retrieval aims to search for data with similar semantic meanings\nacross different content modalities. However, cross-modal retrieval requires\nhuge amounts of storage and retrieval time since it needs to process data in\nmultiple modalities. Existing works focused on learning single-source compact\nfeatures such as binary hash codes that preserve similarities between different\nmodalities. In this work, we propose a jointly learned deep hashing and\nquantization network (HQ) for cross-modal retrieval. We simultaneously learn\nbinary hash codes and quantization codes to preserve semantic information in\nmultiple modalities by an end-to-end deep learning architecture. At the\nretrieval step, binary hashing is used to retrieve a subset of items from the\nsearch space, then quantization is used to re-rank the retrieved items. We\ntheoretically and empirically show that this two-stage retrieval approach\nprovides faster retrieval results while preserving accuracy. Experimental\nresults on the NUS-WIDE, MIR-Flickr, and Amazon datasets demonstrate that HQ\nachieves boosts of more than 7% in precision compared to supervised neural\nnetwork-based compact coding models.",

As an effective way to alleviate information overload, recommender\nsystem can improve the quality of various services by adding application data\ngenerated by users on edge devices, such as visual and textual information, on\nthe basis of sparse rating data. The visual information in the movie trailer is\na significant part of the movie recommender system.

Fortunately, the convolutional neural network can be used\nto extract the visual features precisely. Therefore, the end-to-end neural\nimage caption (NIC) model can be utilized to obtain the textual information\ndescribing the visual features of movie trailers. This paper proposes a trailer\ninception probabilistic matrix factorization model called Ti-PMF, which\ncombines NIC, recurrent convolutional neural network, and probabilistic matrix\nfactorization models as the rating prediction model.

However, the rule of\ndifferent sequence ordering in computer vision (CV) was not well explored,\ne.g., why the \"zigzag\" flattening (ZF) is commonly utilized as a default option\nto get the image patches ordering in vision transformers (ViTs). Notably, when\ndecomposing multi-scale images, the ZF could not maintain the invariance of\nfeature point positions. To this end, we investigate the Hilbert fractal\nflattening (HF) as another method for sequence ordering in CV and contrast it\nagainst ZF. The HF has proven to be superior to other curves in maintaining\nspatial locality, when performing multi-scale transformations of dimensional\nspace.

Like an online algorithm, a priority algorithm\nreceives its input only sequentially and must output irrevocable decisions for\nindividual input items before having seen the input in its entirety. However,\nin contrast to the online setting, a priority algorithm may choose an order on\nthe set of all possible input items and the actual input is then presented\naccording to this order. A priority algorithm is a natural model for the\nintuitively well-understood concept of a greedy algorithm. Apart from analyzing\nthe classical priority setting, we also consider priority algorithms with\nadvice. Originally conceived to study online algorithms from an\ninformation-theoretic point of view, the concept of advice has recently been\nextended to the priority framework.

Informally, a combinatorial AONT\nis an array with the unbiased requirements and its security properties in\ngeneral depend on the prior probability distribution on the inputs $s$-tuples.\nRecently, it was shown by Esfahani and Stinson that a combinatorial AONT has\nperfect security provided that all the inputs $s$-tuples are equiprobable, and\nhas weak security provided that all the inputs $s$-tuples are with non-zero\nprobability.\nThis paper aims to explore on the gap between perfect security and weak\nsecurity for combinatorial $(t,s,v)$-AONTs. Concretely, we consider the typical\nscenario that all the $s$ inputs take values independently (but not necessarily\nidentically) and quantify the amount of information\n$H(\\mathcal{X}|\\mathcal{Y})$ about any $t$ inputs $\\mathcal{X}$ that is not\nrevealed by any $s-t$ outputs $\\mathcal{Y}$. In particular, we establish the\ngeneral lower and upper bounds on $H(\\mathcal{X}|\\mathcal{Y})$ for\ncombinatorial AONTs using information-theoretic techniques, and also show that\nthe derived bounds can be attained in certain cases. Furthermore, the\ndiscussions are extended for the security properties of combinatorial\nasymmetric AONTs.",

In this paper, we propose an Anomalous Latent variable\nGenerative Adversarial Network (ALGAN) in which the GAN generator produces\npseudo-anomalous data as well as fake-normal data, whereas the discriminator is\ntrained to distinguish between normal and pseudo-anomalous data. This differs\nfrom the standard GAN discriminator, which specializes in classifying two\nsimilar classes. The training dataset contains only normal data as anomalous\nstates are introduced in the latent variable and input them into the generator\nto produce diverse pseudo-anomalous data. We compared the performance of ALGAN\nwith other existing methods using the MVTec-AD, Magnetic Tile Defects, and\nCOIL-100 datasets.

Though\npresentation attack detection (PAD) systems try to address this problem, the\nlack of generalization and robustness continues to be a major concern. Several\nworks have shown that using multi-channel PAD systems could alleviate this\nvulnerability and result in more robust systems. However, there is a wide\nselection of channels available for a PAD system such as RGB, Near Infrared,\nShortwave Infrared, Depth, and Thermal sensors. Having a lot of sensors\nincreases the cost of the system, and therefore an understanding of the\nperformance of different sensors against a wide variety of attacks is necessary\nwhile selecting the modalities. In this work, we perform a comprehensive study\nto understand the effectiveness of various imaging modalities for PAD. The\nstudies are performed on a multi-channel PAD dataset, collected with 14\ndifferent sensing modalities considering a wide range of 2D, 3D, and partial\nattacks. We used the multi-channel convolutional network-based architecture,\nwhich uses pixel-wise binary supervision. The model has been evaluated with\ndifferent combinations of channels, and different image qualities on a variety\nof challenging known and unknown attack protocols. The results reveal\ninteresting trends and can act as pointers for sensor selection for\nsafety-critical presentation attack detection systems.

We propose a PoSW\nthat allows any verifier, even the one with no parallelism, to verify using\njust a single sequential computation on a single challenge. All the existing\nPoSWs [6, 3, 1, 4] mandate a prover to compute a sequence of responses from a\nrandom oracle against N -rounds of queries. Then the prover commits this\nsequence using a commitment scheme (e.g., Merkle root (like) commitment)\npredefined in the PoSWs. Now the verifier asks the prover to provide a set of\nproofs against t randomly chosen checkpoints, called as challenges, in the\ncomputed sequence. The verifier finds out the commitment from each of these\nproofs spending O(log N ) rounds of queries to the oracle. It can be reduced to\na single round of queries only if the verifier owns O(log N ) parallelism [4].\nThe verifier in our PoSW demands no parallelism but uses a single query to the\nrandom oracle in order to verify each of the t challenges. The key observation\nis that the commitment schemes themselves in the prior works demand O(log N )\noracle queries to verify. So our PoSW asks the prover to undergo an additional\nefficient binary operation x on the responses from the random oracle against N\n-rounds of queries.

The representations of existing PAD works with simple global\npooling method, however, lose the local feature discriminability.

    "title": "AF$_2$: Adaptive Focus Framework for Aerial Imagery Segmentation",
    "abstract": "As a specific semantic segmentation task, aerial imagery segmentation has\nbeen widely employed in high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing images\nunderstanding. Besides common issues (e.g. large scale variation) faced by\ngeneral semantic segmentation tasks, aerial imagery segmentation has some\nunique challenges, the most critical one among which lies in\nforeground-background imbalance. There have been some recent efforts that\nattempt to address this issue by proposing sophisticated neural network\narchitectures, since they can be used to extract informative multi-scale\nfeature representations and increase the discrimination of object boundaries.\nNevertheless, many of them merely utilize those multi-scale representations in\nad-hoc measures but disregard the fact that the semantic meaning of objects\nwith various sizes could be better identified via receptive fields of diverse\nranges. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Focus Framework (AF$_2$), which\nadopts a hierarchical segmentation procedure and focuses on adaptively\nutilizing multi-scale representations generated by widely adopted neural\nnetwork architectures. Particularly, a learnable module, called Adaptive\nConfidence Mechanism (ACM), is proposed to determine which scale of\nrepresentation should be used for the segmentation of different objects.\nComprehensive experiments show that AF$_2$ has significantly improved the\naccuracy on three widely used aerial benchmarks, as fast as the mainstream\nmethod.",

Our framework has three stages: in stage 1, we leverage non-RL\ndatasets (e.g. ImageNet) to learn task-agnostic visual representations; in\nstage 2, we use offline RL data (e.g. a limited number of expert\ndemonstrations) to convert the task-agnostic representations into more powerful\ntask-specific representations; in stage 3, we fine-tune the agent with online\nRL. On a set of highly challenging hand manipulation tasks with sparse reward\nand realistic visual inputs, our framework learns 370%-1200% faster than the\nprevious SOTA method while using an encoder that is 50 times smaller, fully\ndemonstrating the potential of data-driven deep reinforcement learning.",

    "abstract": "Traffic flow prediction is an integral part of an intelligent transportation\nsystem and thus fundamental for various traffic-related applications. Buses are\nan indispensable way of moving for urban residents with fixed routes and\nschedules, which leads to latent travel regularity. However, human mobility\npatterns, specifically the complex relationships between bus passengers, are\ndeeply hidden in this fixed mobility mode. Although many models exist to\npredict traffic flow, human mobility patterns have not been well explored in\nthis regard. To reduce this research gap and learn human mobility knowledge\nfrom this fixed travel behaviors, we propose a multi-pattern passenger flow\nprediction framework, MPGCN, based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN).\nFirstly, we construct a novel sharing-stop network to model relationships\nbetween passengers based on bus record data. Then, we employ GCN to extract\nfeatures from the graph by learning useful topology information and introduce a\ndeep clustering method to recognize mobility patterns hidden in bus passengers.\nFurthermore, to fully utilize Spatio-temporal information, we propose GCN2Flow\nto predict passenger flow based on various mobility patterns. To the best of\nour knowledge, this paper is the first work to adopt a multipattern approach to\npredict the bus passenger flow from graph learning. We design a case study for\noptimizing routes. Extensive experiments upon a real-world bus dataset\ndemonstrate that MPGCN has potential efficacy in passenger flow prediction and\nroute optimization.",

Given the very limited budget of human intervention,\nit remains challenging to design when and how human expert interacts with the\nlearning agent in the training. In this work, we develop a novel\nhuman-in-the-loop learning method called Human-AI Copilot Optimization\n(HACO).To allow the agent's sufficient exploration in the risky environments\nwhile ensuring the training safety, the human expert can take over the control\nand demonstrate how to avoid probably dangerous situations or trivial\nbehaviors.

HACO extracts proxy state-action values from partial\nhuman demonstration and optimizes the agent to improve the proxy values\nmeanwhile reduce the human interventions. The experiments show that HACO\nachieves a substantially high sample efficiency in the safe driving benchmark.\nHACO can train agents to drive in unseen traffic scenarios with a handful of\nhuman intervention budget and achieve high safety and generalizability,\noutperforming both reinforcement learning and imitation learning baselines with\na large margin.

    "abstract": "In many applications, e.g. fault diagnostics and optimized control of\nsupermarket refrigeration systems, it is important to determine the heat demand\nof the cabinets. This can easily be achieved by measuring the mass flow through\neach cabinet, however, that is expensive and not feasible in large-scale\ndeployments. Therefore it is important to be able to estimate the valve sizes\nfrom the monitoring data, which is typically measured. The valve size is\nmeasured by an area, which can be used to calculate mass flow through the valve\n-- this estimated value is referred to as the valve constant. A novel method\nfor estimating the cabinet evaporator valve constants is proposed in the\npresent paper. It is demonstrated using monitoring data from a refrigeration\nsystem in a supermarket consisting of data sampled at a one-minute sampling\nrate, however it is shown that a sampling time of around 10-20 minutes is\nadequate for the method. Through thermodynamic analysis of a two-stage CO2\nrefrigeration system, a linear regression model for estimating valve constants\nwas developed using time series data. The linear regression requires that\ntransient dynamics are not present in the data, which depends on multiple\nfactors e.g. the sampling time. If dynamics are not modeled it can be detected\nby a significant auto-correlation of the residuals. In order to include the\ndynamics in the model, an Auto-Regressive Moving Average model with eXogenous\nvariables (ARMAX) was applied, and it is shown how it effectively eliminates\nthe auto-correlation and provides more unbiased estimates, as well as improved\nthe accuracy estimates. Furthermore, it is shown that the sample time has a\nhuge impact on the valve estimates. Thus, a method for selecting the optimal\nsampling time is introduced. It works individually for each of the evaporators,\nby exploring their respective frequency spectrum.",

Traditionally,\nAQM policies relied on heuristics to approximately provide Quality of Service\n(QoS) such as a target delay for a given flow.

    "title": "Self-Supervised Bulk Motion Artifact Removal in Optical Coherence  Tomography Angiography",
    "abstract": "Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is an important imaging\nmodality in many bioengineering tasks. The image quality of OCTA, however, is\noften hurt by Bulk Motion Artifacts (BMA), which are due to micromotion of\nsubjects and typically appear as bright stripes surrounded by blurred areas.\nState-of-the-art BMA handling solutions usually treat the problem as an image\ninpainting one with deep neural network algorithms. These solutions, however,\nrequire numerous training samples with nontrivial annotation. Nevertheless,\nthis context-based inpainting model has limited correction capability because\nit discards the rich structural and appearance information carried in the BMA\nstripe region. To address these issues, in this paper we propose a\nself-supervised content-aware BMA recover model. First, the gradient-based\nstructural information and appearance feature are extracted from the BMA area\nand injected into the model to capture more connectivity. Second, with easily\ncollected defective masks, the model is trained in a self-supervised manner\nthat only the clear areas are for training while the BMA areas for inference.\nWith structural information and appearance feature from noisy image as\nreferences, our model could correct larger BMA and produce better visualizing\nresult. Only 2D images with defective masks are involved so our method is more\nefficient. Experiments on OCTA of mouse cortex demonstrate that our model could\ncorrect most BMA with extremely large sizes and inconsistent intensities while\nexisting methods fail.",

    "abstract": "Device density in cellular networks is expected to increase considerably in\nthe next future. Accordingly, the access point (AP) will equip massive\nmultiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) antennas, using collimated\nmillimeter-wave (mmW) and sub-THz communications, and increase the bandwidth to\naccommodate the growing data rate demands. In this scenario, interference plays\na critical role and, if not characterized and mitigated properly, might limit\nthe performances of the network. In this context, this paper derives the\nstatistical properties of the aggregated interference power for a cellular\nnetwork equipping a mMIMO cylindrical array. The proposed statistical model\nconsiders the link blockage and other network parameters such as antenna\nconfiguration and device density. The findings show that the characteristic\nfunction (CF) of the aggregated interference power can be regarded as a\nweighted mixture of two alpha-stable distributions. Furthermore, by analyzing\nthe service probability, it is found that there is an optimal configuration of\nthe array depending on the AP height and device density. The proposed\nstatistical model can be part of the design of dense networks providing\nvaluable insights for optimal network deployment",

    "abstract": "Dependencies on the relative frequency of a state in the domain are common\nwhen modelling probabilistic dependencies on relational data. For instance, the\nlikelihood of a school closure during an epidemic might depend on the\nproportion of infected pupils exceeding a threshold. Often, rather than\ndepending on discrete thresholds, dependencies are continuous: for instance,\nthe likelihood of any one mosquito bite transmitting an illness depends on the\nproportion of carrier mosquitoes. Current approaches usually only consider\nprobabilities over possible worlds rather than over domain elements themselves.\nWe introduce two formalisms that explicitly incorporate relative frequencies\ninto statistical relational artificial intelligence. The first formalism,\nLifted Bayesian Networks for Conditional Probability Logic, expresses discrete\ndependencies on probabilistic data. The second formalism, Functional Lifted\nBayesian Networks, expresses continuous dependencies. Incorporating relative\nfrequencies is not only beneficial to modelling; it also provides a more\nrigorous approach to learning problems where training and test or application\ndomains have different sizes. To this end, we provide a representation of the\nasymptotic probability distributions induced by the two formalisms on domains\nof increasing sizes. Since that representation has well-understood scaling\nbehaviour across domain sizes, it can be used to estimate parameters for a\nlarge domain consistently from randomly sampled subpopulations.",

Given any family of such problems\nand space of mechanisms for the principal to choose from, the delegation gap is\nthe worst-case ratio of the principal's optimal utility when they delegate\nversus their optimal utility when solving the problem on their own. In this\nwork, we consider the delegation gap of the generalized Pandora's box problem,\na search problem in which searching for solutions incurs known costs and\nsolutions are restricted by some downward-closed constraint. First, we show\nthat there is a special case when all random variables have binary support for\nwhich there exist constant-factor delegation gaps for matroid constraints.\nHowever, there is no constant-factor delegation gap for even simple non-binary\ninstances of the problem. Getting around this impossibility, we consider two\nvariants: the free-agent model, in which the agent doesn't pay the cost of\nprobing elements, and discounted-cost approximations, in which we discount all\ncosts and aim for a bicriteria approximation of the discount factor and\ndelegation gap. We show that there are constant-factor delegation gaps in the\nfree-agent model with discounted-cost approximations for certain downward\nclosed constraints and constant discount factors.

In this paper, we explore how machine\nlearning methods used successfully in cyber domains, such as malware detection,\ncan be leveraged to substantially enhance physical space detection. We focus on\none important exemplar application--the detection and localization of\nradioactive materials. We show that the ML-based approaches can significantly\nexceed traditional table-based approaches in predicting angular direction.\nMoreover, the developed models can be expanded to include approximations of the\ndistance to radioactive material (a critical dimension that reference tables\nused in practice do not capture). With four and eight detector arrays, we\ncollect counts of gamma-rays as features for a suite of machine learning models\nto localize radioactive material. We explore seven unique scenarios via\nsimulation frameworks frequently used for radiation detection and with physical\nexperiments using radioactive material in laboratory environments.

The success of this\nalignment strategy is attributed to its capability in maximizing the mutual\ninformation (MI) between an image and its matched text. However, simply\nperforming cross-modal alignment (CMA) ignores data potential within each\nmodality, which may result in degraded representations. For instance, although\nCMA-based models are able to map image-text pairs close together in the\nembedding space, they fail to ensure that similar inputs from the same modality\nstay close by. This problem can get even worse when the pre-training data is\nnoisy. In this paper, we propose triple contrastive learning (TCL) for\nvision-language pre-training by leveraging both cross-modal and intra-modal\nself-supervision. Besides CMA, TCL introduces an intra-modal contrastive\nobjective to provide complementary benefits in representation learning. To take\nadvantage of localized and structural information from image and text input,\nTCL further maximizes the average MI between local regions of image/text and\ntheir global summary. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work that\ntakes into account local structure information for multi-modality\nrepresentation learning.

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection among a large number of processes arises in many\napplications ranging from dynamic spectrum access to\n\\textcolor{NewColor}{cybersecurity}. In such problems one can often obtain\nnoisy observations aggregated from a chosen subset of processes\n\\textcolor{NewColor}{that} {conforms} to a tree structure. The distribution of\nthese observation\\textcolor{NewColor}{s}, based on which the presence of\nanomalies is detected, may be only partially known. This gives rise to the need\nfor a search strategy designed to account for both the sample complexity and\nthe detection accuracy, as well as cope with statistical models that are known\nonly up to some missing parameters. In this work we propose\n\\textcolor{NewColor}{a} sequential search strategy using two variations of the\n\\acl{gllr} \\textcolor{NewColor}{statistic}. Our proposed \\ac{hds} strategy is\nshown to be order-optimal with respect to the size of the search space and\nasymptotically optimal with respect to the detection accuracy.

    "abstract": "Model interpretability methods are often used to explain NLP model decisions\non tasks such as text classification, where the output space is relatively\nsmall. However, when applied to language generation, where the output space\noften consists of tens of thousands of tokens, these methods are unable to\nprovide informative explanations. Language models must consider various\nfeatures to predict a token, such as its part of speech, number, tense, or\nsemantics. Existing explanation methods conflate evidence for all these\nfeatures into a single explanation, which is less interpretable for human\nunderstanding.\nTo disentangle the different decisions in language modeling, we focus on\nexplaining language models contrastively: we look for salient input tokens that\nexplain why the model predicted one token instead of another. We demonstrate\nthat contrastive explanations are quantifiably better than non-contrastive\nexplanations in verifying major grammatical phenomena, and that they\nsignificantly improve contrastive model simulatability for human observers. We\nalso identify groups of contrastive decisions where the model uses similar\nevidence, and we are able to characterize what input tokens models use during\nvarious language generation decisions.",

Existing methods often\nfocus on state-based metrics, which do not consider the underlying causal\nstructures of the environment, and while recent research has begun to explore\nRL environments for causal learning, these environments primarily leverage\ncausal information through causal inference or induction rather than\nexploration.

In this\nwork, we introduce a novel RL environment designed with a controllable causal\nstructure, which allows us to evaluate exploration strategies used by both\nagents and children in a unified environment. In addition, through\nexperimentation on both computation models and children, we demonstrate that\nthere are significant differences between information-gain optimal RL\nexploration in causal environments and the exploration of children in the same\nenvironments.

    "abstract": "Robot planning in partially observable domains is difficult, because a robot\nneeds to estimate the current state and plan actions at the same time. When the\ndomain includes many objects, reasoning about the objects and their\nrelationships makes robot planning even more difficult. In this paper, we\ndevelop an algorithm called scene analysis for robot planning (SARP) that\nenables robots to reason with visual contextual information toward achieving\nlong-term goals under uncertainty. SARP constructs scene graphs, a factored\nrepresentation of objects and their relations, using images captured from\ndifferent positions, and reasons with them to enable context-aware robot\nplanning under partial observability. Experiments have been conducted using\nmultiple 3D environments in simulation, and a dataset collected by a real\nrobot. In comparison to standard robot planning and scene analysis methods, in\na target search domain, SARP improves both efficiency and accuracy in task\ncompletion.

It is therefore important\nto investigate the challenges that software teams and organizations face with\nnew remote and hybrid work. Consequently, this paper reports a year-long,\nparticipant-observation, constructivist grounded theory study investigating the\nimpact of working from home on software development. This study resulted in a\ntheory of software team coordination. Briefly, shifting from in-office to\nat-home work fundamentally altered coordination within software teams. While\ngroup cohesion and more effective communication appear protective, coordination\nis undermined by distrust, parenting and communication bricolage. Poor\ncoordination leads to numerous problems including misunderstandings, help\nrequests, lower job satisfaction among team members, and more ill-defined\ntasks. These problems, in turn, reduce overall project success and prompt\nprofessionals to alter their software development processes (in this case, from\nScrum to Kanban). Our findings suggest that software organizations with many\nremote employees can improve performance by encouraging greater engagement\nwithin teams and supporting employees with family and childcare\nresponsibilities.",

The robot observes the\nhuman operator via a single RGB camera and imitates their actions in real-time.\nHuman hands and robot hands differ in shape, size, and joint structure, and\nperforming this translation from a single uncalibrated camera is a highly\nunderconstrained problem. Moreover, the retargeted trajectories must\neffectively execute tasks on a physical robot, which requires them to be\ntemporally smooth and free of self-collisions.

We leverage\nthis data to train a system that understands human hands and retargets a human\nvideo stream into a robot hand-arm trajectory that is smooth, swift, safe, and\nsemantically similar to the guiding demonstration. We demonstrate that it\nenables previously untrained people to teleoperate a robot on various dexterous\nmanipulation tasks.

In benchmark generative\nmodeling tasks such as training binary variational autoencoders, our gradient\nestimator achieves substantially lower variance than state-of-the-art\nestimators with the same number of function evaluations.",

Recently, convolutional neural networks have shown significant\nability to extract the blood vessel structure. However, it remains challenging\nto refined segmentation for the capillaries and the edges of retinal vessels\ndue to thickness inconsistencies and blurry boundaries. In this paper, we\npropose a novel deep neural network for retinal vessel segmentation based on\nshared decoder and pyramid-like loss (SPNet) to address the above problems.\nSpecifically, we introduce a decoder-sharing mechanism to capture multi-scale\nsemantic information, where feature maps at diverse scales are decoded through\na sequence of weight-sharing decoder modules. Also, to strengthen\ncharacterization on the capillaries and the edges of blood vessels, we define a\nresidual pyramid architecture which decomposes the spatial information in the\ndecoding phase. A pyramid-like loss function is designed to compensate possible\nsegmentation errors progressively. Experimental results on public benchmarks\nshow that the proposed method outperforms the backbone network and the\nstate-of-the-art methods, especially in the regions of the capillaries and the\nvessel contours. In addition, performances on cross-datasets verify that SPNet\nshows stronger generalization ability.",

Due\nto the adverse effects of radiation on patients, the radiation dose is expected\nto be reduced as low as possible. Sparse sampling is an effective way, but it\nwill lead to severe artifacts on the reconstructed CT image, thus sparse-view\nCT image reconstruction has been a prevailing and challenging research area.\nWith the popularity of mobile devices, the requirements for lightweight and\nreal-time networks are increasing rapidly. In this paper, we design a novel\nlightweight network called CAGAN, and propose a dual-domain reconstruction\npipeline for parallel beam sparse-view CT. CAGAN is an adversarial\nauto-encoder, combining the Coordinate Attention unit, which preserves the\nspatial information of features. Also, the application of Shuffle Blocks\nreduces the parameters by a quarter without sacrificing its performance. In the\nRadon domain, the CAGAN learns the mapping between the interpolated data and\nfringe-free projection data. After the restored Radon data is reconstructed to\nan image, the image is sent into the second CAGAN trained for recovering the\ndetails, so that a high-quality image is obtained.

The choice of\npolytope reflects the presumed features of the latent components and their\nmutual relationships.

    "abstract": "The optimistic gradient method has seen increasing popularity as an efficient\nfirst-order method for solving convex-concave saddle point problems. To analyze\nits iteration complexity, a recent work [arXiv:1901.08511] proposed an\ninteresting perspective that interprets the optimistic gradient method as an\napproximation to the proximal point method. In this paper, we follow this\napproach and distill the underlying idea of optimism to propose a generalized\noptimistic method, which encompasses the optimistic gradient method as a\nspecial case. Our general framework can handle constrained saddle point\nproblems with composite objective functions and can work with arbitrary norms\nwith compatible Bregman distances. Moreover, we also develop an adaptive line\nsearch scheme to select the stepsizes without knowledge of the smoothness\ncoefficients. We instantiate our method with first-order, second-order and\nhigher-order oracles and give sharp global iteration complexity bounds. When\nthe objective function is convex-concave, we show that the averaged iterates of\nour $p$-th-order method ($p\\geq 1$) converge at a rate of\n$\\mathcal{O}(1/N^\\frac{p+1}{2})$. When the objective function is further\nstrongly-convex-strongly-concave, we prove a complexity bound of\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{L_1}{\\mu}\\log\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})$ for our first-order method\nand a bound of $\\mathcal{O}((L_p\nD^\\frac{p-1}{2}/\\mu)^{\\frac{2}{p+1}}+\\log\\log\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})$ for our\n$p$-th-order method ($p\\geq 2$) respectively, where $L_p$ ($p\\geq 1$) is the\nLipschitz constant of the $p$-th-order derivative, $\\mu$ is the strongly-convex\nparameter, and $D$ is the initial Bregman distance to the saddle point.\nMoreover, our line search scheme provably only requires an almost constant\nnumber of calls to a subproblem solver per iteration on average, making our\nfirst-order and second-order methods particularly amenable to implementation.",

We propose a new\nframework for channel prediction that can not only predict the detailed\nvariations of the received power, but can also predict the detailed makeup of\nthe wireless rays (i.e., amplitude, angle-of-arrival, and phase of all the\nincoming paths). More specifically, we show how an enclosure-based robotic\nroute design ensures that the received power measurements at the prior\nmeasurement locations can be utilized to fully predict detailed ray parameters\nat unvisited locations. We then show how to first estimate the detailed ray\nparameters at the prior measurement route and then fully extend them to predict\nthe detailed ray makeup at unvisited locations in the workspace. We\nexperimentally validate our proposed framework through extensive real-world\nexperiments in three different areas, and show that our approach can accurately\npredict the received channel power and the detailed makeup of the rays at\nunvisited locations in an area, considerably outperforming the state-of-the-art\nin wireless channel prediction.",

    "abstract": "Change detection (CD) is an essential earth observation technique. It\ncaptures the dynamic information of land objects. With the rise of deep\nlearning, neural networks (NN) have shown great potential in CD. However,\ncurrent NN models introduce backbone architectures that lose the detail\ninformation during learning. Moreover, current NN models are heavy in\nparameters, which prevents their deployment on edge devices such as drones. In\nthis work, we tackle this issue by proposing RDP-Net: a region detail\npreserving network for CD. We propose an efficient training strategy that\nquantifies the importance of individual samples during the warmup period of NN\ntraining. Then, we perform non-uniform sampling based on the importance score\nso that the NN could learn detail information from easy to hard. Next, we\npropose an effective edge loss that improves the network's attention on details\nsuch as boundaries and small regions. As a result, we provide a NN model that\nachieves the state-of-the-art empirical performance in CD with only 1.70M\nparameters. We hope our RDP-Net would benefit the practical CD applications on\ncompact devices and could inspire more people to bring change detection to a\nnew level with the efficient training strategy.",

    "abstract": "Image quality assessment (IQA) in medical imaging can be used to ensure that\ndownstream clinical tasks can be reliably performed. Quantifying the impact of\nan image on the specific target tasks, also named as task amenability, is\nneeded. A task-specific IQA has recently been proposed to learn an\nimage-amenability-predicting controller simultaneously with a target task\npredictor. This allows for the trained IQA controller to measure the impact an\nimage has on the target task performance, when this task is performed using the\npredictor, e.g. segmentation and classification neural networks in modern\nclinical applications. In this work, we propose an extension to this\ntask-specific IQA approach, by adding a task-agnostic IQA based on\nauto-encoding as the target task. Analysing the intersection between\nlow-quality images, deemed by both the task-specific and task-agnostic IQA, may\nhelp to differentiate the underpinning factors that caused the poor target task\nperformance. For example, common imaging artefacts may not adversely affect the\ntarget task, which would lead to a low task-agnostic quality and a high\ntask-specific quality, whilst individual cases considered clinically\nchallenging, which can not be improved by better imaging equipment or\nprotocols, is likely to result in a high task-agnostic quality but a low\ntask-specific quality. We first describe a flexible reward shaping strategy\nwhich allows for the adjustment of weighting between task-agnostic and\ntask-specific quality scoring. Furthermore, we evaluate the proposed algorithm\nusing a clinically challenging target task of prostate tumour segmentation on\nmultiparametric magnetic resonance (mpMR) images, from 850 patients. The\nproposed reward shaping strategy, with appropriately weighted task-specific and\ntask-agnostic qualities, successfully identified samples that need\nre-acquisition due to defected imaging process.",

    "abstract": "Brain tumor detection can make the difference between life and death.\nRecently, deep learning-based brain tumor detection techniques have gained\nattention due to their higher performance. However, obtaining the expected\nperformance of such deep learning-based systems requires large amounts of\nclassified images to train the deep models. Obtaining such data is usually\nboring, time-consuming, and can easily be exposed to human mistakes which\nhinder the utilization of such deep learning approaches. This paper introduces\na novel framework for brain tumor detection and classification. The basic idea\nis to generate a large synthetic MRI images dataset that reflects the typical\npattern of the brain MRI images from a small class-unbalanced collected\ndataset. The resulted dataset is then used for training a deep model for\ndetection and classification. Specifically, we employ two types of deep models.\nThe first model is a generative model to capture the distribution of the\nimportant features in a set of small class-unbalanced brain MRI images. Then by\nusing this distribution, the generative model can synthesize any number of\nbrain MRI images for each class. Hence, the system can automatically convert a\nsmall unbalanced dataset to a larger balanced one. The second model is the\nclassifier that is trained using the large balanced dataset to detect brain\ntumors in MRI images. The proposed framework acquires an overall detection\naccuracy of 96.88% which highlights the promise of the proposed framework as an\naccurate low-overhead brain tumor detection system.",

    "abstract": "Machine Learning explainability techniques have been proposed as a means of\n`explaining' or interrogating a model in order to understand why a particular\ndecision or prediction has been made. Such an ability is especially important\nat a time when machine learning is being used to automate decision processes\nwhich concern sensitive factors and legal outcomes. Indeed, it is even a\nrequirement according to EU law. Furthermore, researchers concerned with\nimposing overly restrictive functional form (e.g. as would be the case in a\nlinear regression) may be motivated to use machine learning algorithms in\nconjunction with explainability techniques, as part of exploratory research,\nwith the goal of identifying important variables which are associated with an\noutcome of interest. For example, epidemiologists might be interested in\nidentifying 'risk factors' - i.e., factors which affect recovery from disease -\nby using random forests and assessing variable relevance using importance\nmeasures. However, and as we aim to demonstrate, machine learning algorithms\nare not as flexible as they might seem, and are instead incredibly sensitive to\nthe underling causal structure in the data. The consequences of this are that\npredictors which are, in fact, critical to a causal system and highly\ncorrelated with the outcome, may nonetheless be deemed by explainability\ntechniques to be unrelated/unimportant/unpredictive of the outcome. Rather than\nthis being a limitation of explainability techniques per se, it is rather a\nconsequence of the mathematical implications of regressions, and the\ninteraction of these implications with the associated conditional\nindependencies of the underlying causal structure.

In this work, we investigate two major\nforms of biases, i.e., class-dependent residuals and mode collapse, in a case\nstudy of estimating photometric redshifts as a classification problem using\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and galaxy images with spectroscopic\nredshifts. We focus on point estimates and propose a set of consecutive steps\nfor resolving the two biases based on CNN models, involving representation\nlearning with multi-channel outputs, balancing the training data and leveraging\nsoft labels. The residuals can be viewed as a function of spectroscopic\nredshifts or photometric redshifts, and the biases with respect to these two\ndefinitions are incompatible and should be treated in a split way. We suggest\nthat resolving biases in the spectroscopic space is a prerequisite for\nresolving biases in the photometric space. Experiments show that our methods\npossess a better capability in controlling biases compared to benchmark\nmethods, and exhibit robustness under varying implementing and training\nconditions provided with high-quality data. Our methods have promises for\nfuture cosmological surveys that require a good constraint of biases, and may\nbe applied to regression problems and other studies that make use of\ndata-driven models.

The ability to be able to make long-range forecasts of sea\nsurface temperature anomalies, especially those associated with extreme marine\nheatwave events, has potentially significant economic and societal benefits. We\nhave developed a deep learning time series prediction model (Unet-LSTM) based\non more than 70 years (1950-2021) of ECMWF ERA5 monthly mean sea surface\ntemperature and 2-metre air temperature data. The Unet-LSTM model is able to\nlearn the underlying physics driving the temporal evolution of the\n2-dimensional global sea surface temperatures. The model accurately predicts\nsea surface temperatures over a 24 month period with a root mean square error\nremaining below 0.75$^\\circ$C for all predicted months.

    "abstract": "Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using clinical evaluation\n(cognitive tests) is challenging due to wide variations amongst individuals.\nSince no effective treatment exists, prompt and reliable ASD diagnosis can\nenable the effective preparation of treatment regimens. This paper proposes\nstructural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI)-based ASD diagnosis via an outlier\ndetection approach. To learn Spatio-temporal patterns in structural brain\nconnectivity, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is trained exclusively\nwith sMRI scans of healthy subjects. Given a stack of three adjacent slices as\ninput, the GAN generator reconstructs the next three adjacent slices; the GAN\ndiscriminator then identifies ASD sMRI scan reconstructions as outliers. This\nmodel is compared against two other baselines -- a simpler UNet and a\nsophisticated Self-Attention GAN. Axial, Coronal, and Sagittal sMRI slices from\nthe multi-site ABIDE II dataset are used for evaluation. Extensive experiments\nreveal that our ASD detection framework performs comparably with the\nstate-of-the-art with far fewer training data. Furthermore, longitudinal data\n(two scans per subject over time) achieve 17-28% higher accuracy than\ncross-sectional data (one scan per subject). Among other findings, metrics\nemployed for model training as well as reconstruction loss computation impact\ndetection performance, and the coronal modality is found to best encode\nstructural information for ASD detection.",

Recent\nstudies show that speaker extraction benefits from the location or direction of\nthe target speaker.

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end localized target\nspeaker extraction on pure speech cues, that is called L-SpEx.

Then, the spatial cues and target speaker's\nembedding are both used to form a top-down auditory attention to the target\nspeaker.

We consider that a low dimensional linear representation is\nshared across the tasks, and study the benefit of learning this representation\nin the multi-task learning setting. Following recent results to design\nstochastic bandit policies, we propose an efficient greedy policy based on\ntrace norm regularization. It implicitly learns a low dimensional\nrepresentation by encouraging the matrix formed by the task regression vectors\nto be of low rank. Unlike previous work in the literature, our policy does not\nneed to know the rank of the underlying matrix. We derive an upper bound on the\nmulti-task regret of our policy, which is, up to logarithmic factors, of order\n$\\sqrt{NdT(T+d)r}$, where $T$ is the number of tasks, $r$ the rank, $d$ the\nnumber of variables and $N$ the number of rounds per task. We show the benefit\nof our strategy compared to the baseline $Td\\sqrt{N}$ obtained by solving each\ntask independently.

A set of logical rules are defined which construct a minimally\nsized virtual reaction network comprising three additional nodes (N, NO, NO2).\nThis NOX virtual reaction network is appended to a pre-existing compact model\nfor methane combustion comprising fifteen nodes.\nThe resulting eighteen node virtual reaction network is processed by the\nMLOCK coded algorithm to produce a plethora of compact model candidates for NOX\nformation during methane combustion. MLOCK automatically; populates the terms\nof the virtual reaction network with candidate inputs; measures the success of\nthe resulting compact model candidates (in reproducing a broad set of gas\nturbine industry-defined performance targets); selects regions of input\nparameters space showing models of best performance; refines the input\nparameters to give better performance; and makes an ultimate selection of the\nbest performing model or models.\nBy this method, it is shown that a number of compact model candidates exist\nthat show fidelities in excess of 75% in reproducing industry defined\nperformance targets, with one model valid to >75% across fuel/air equivalence\nratios of 0.5-1.0.

    "abstract": "Inhomogeneities in the aortic wall can lead to localized stress\naccumulations, possibly initiating dissection. In many cases, a dissection\nresults from pathological changes such as fragmentation or loss of elastic\nfibers. But it has been shown that even the healthy aortic wall has an inherent\nheterogeneous microstructure. Some parts of the aorta are particularly\nsusceptible to the development of inhomogeneities due to pathological changes,\nhowever, the distribution in the aortic wall and the spatial extent, such as\nsize, shape, and type, are difficult to predict. Motivated by this observation,\nwe describe the heterogeneous distribution of elastic fiber degradation in the\ndissected aortic wall using a stochastic constitutive model. For this purpose,\nrandom field realizations, which model the stochastic distribution of degraded\nelastic fibers, are generated over a non-equidistant grid. The random field\nthen serves as input for a uni-axial extension test of the pathological aortic\nwall, solved with the finite-element (FE) method. To include the microstructure\nof the dissected aortic wall, a constitutive model developed in a previous\nstudy is applied, which also includes an approach to model the degradation of\ninter-lamellar elastic fibers. Then to assess the uncertainty in the output\nstress distribution due to this stochastic constitutive model, a convolutional\nneural network, specifically a Bayesian encoder-decoder, was used as a\nsurrogate model that maps the random input fields to the output stress\ndistribution obtained from the FE analysis. The results show that the neural\nnetwork is able to predict the stress distribution of the FE analysis while\nsignificantly reducing the computational time. In addition, it provides the\nprobability for exceeding critical stresses within the aortic wall, which could\nallow for the prediction of delamination or fatal rupture.",

    "abstract": "To study information processing in the brain, neuroscientists manipulate\nexperimental stimuli while recording participant brain activity. They can then\nuse encoding models to find out which brain \"zone\" (e.g. which region of\ninterest, volume pixel or electrophysiology sensor) is predicted from the\nstimulus properties. Given the assumptions underlying this setup, when stimulus\nproperties are predictive of the activity in a zone, these properties are\nunderstood to cause activity in that zone.\nIn recent years, researchers have used neural networks to construct\nrepresentations that capture the diverse properties of complex stimuli, such as\nnatural language or natural images. Encoding models built using these\nhigh-dimensional representations are often able to significantly predict the\nactivity in large swathes of cortex, suggesting that the activity in all these\nbrain zones is caused by stimulus properties captured in the representation. It\nis then natural to ask: \"Is the activity in these different brain zones caused\nby the stimulus properties in the same way?\" In neuroscientific terms, this\ncorresponds to asking if these different zones process the stimulus properties\nin the same way.\nHere, we propose a new framework that enables researchers to ask if the\nproperties of a stimulus affect two brain zones in the same way. We use\nsimulated data and two real fMRI datasets with complex naturalistic stimuli to\nshow that our framework enables us to make such inferences. Our inferences are\nstrikingly consistent between the two datasets, indicating that the proposed\nframework is a promising new tool for neuroscientists to understand how\ninformation is processed in the brain.",

    "title": "Selling to a principal and a budget-constrained agent",
    "abstract": "We analyze a model of selling a single object to a principal-agent pair who\nwant to acquire the object for a firm. The principal and the agent have\ndifferent assessments of the object's value to the firm. The agent is\nbudget-constrained while the principal is not. The agent participates in the\nmechanism, but she can (strategically) delegate decision-making to the\nprincipal. We derive the revenue-maximizing mechanism in a two-dimensional type\nspace (values of the agent and the principal). We show that below a threshold\nbudget, a mechanism involving two posted prices and three outcomes (one of\nwhich involves randomization) is the optimal mechanism for the seller.\nOtherwise, a single posted price mechanism is optimal.",

    "title": "(Dis)assortative Partitions on Random Regular Graphs",
    "abstract": "We study the problem of assortative and disassortative partitions on random\n$d$-regular graphs. Nodes in the graph are partitioned into two non-empty\ngroups. In the assortative partition every node requires at least $H$ of their\nneighbors to be in their own group. In the disassortative partition they\nrequire less than $H$ neighbors to be in their own group. Using the cavity\nmethod based on analysis of the Belief Propagation algorithm we establish for\nwhich combinations of parameters $(d,H)$ these partitions exist with high\nprobability and for which they do not. For $H>\\lceil \\frac{d}{2} \\rceil $ we\nestablish that the structure of solutions to the assortative partition problems\ncorresponds to the so-called frozen-1RSB. This entails a conjecture of\nalgorithmic hardness of finding these partitions efficiently. For $H \\le \\lceil\n\\frac{d}{2} \\rceil $ we argue that the assortative partition problem is\nalgorithmically easy on average for all $d$. Further we provide arguments about\nasymptotic equivalence between the assortative partition problem and the\ndisassortative one, going trough a close relation to the problem of\nsingle-spin-flip-stable states in spin glasses. In the context of spin glasses,\nour results on algorithmic hardness imply a conjecture that gapped single spin\nflip stable states are hard to find which may be a universal reason behind the\nobservation that physical dynamics in glassy systems display convergence to\nmarginal stability.",

Recent advancements in deep learning research show that generative\nmodels have achieved substantial improvement in the aspects of style transfer\nand image synthesis. In this work, we formulate generating the missing MR\nmodality from existing MR modalities as an imputation problem using style\ntransfer. With a multiple-to-one mapping, we model a network that accommodates\ndomain specific styles in generating the target image. We analyse the style\ndiversity both within and across MR modalities. Our model is tested on the\nBraTS'18 dataset and the results obtained are observed to be on par with the\nstate-of-the-art in terms of visual metrics, SSIM and PSNR. After being\nevaluated by two expert radiologists, we show that our model is efficient,\nextendable, and suitable for clinical applications.",
