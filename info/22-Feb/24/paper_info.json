    "abstract": "Deep-learning-based intelligent services have become prevalent in\ncyber-physical applications including smart cities and health-care.\nCollaborative end-edge-cloud computing for deep learning provides a range of\nperformance and efficiency that can address application requirements through\ncomputation offloading. The decision to offload computation is a\ncommunication-computation co-optimization problem that varies with both system\nparameters (e.g., network condition) and workload characteristics (e.g.,\ninputs). Identifying optimal orchestration considering the cross-layer\nopportunities and requirements in the face of varying system dynamics is a\nchallenging multi-dimensional problem. While Reinforcement Learning (RL)\napproaches have been proposed earlier, they suffer from a large number of\ntrial-and-errors during the learning process resulting in excessive time and\nresource consumption. We present a Hybrid Learning orchestration framework that\nreduces the number of interactions with the system environment by combining\nmodel-based and model-free reinforcement learning. Our Deep Learning inference\norchestration strategy employs reinforcement learning to find the optimal\norchestration policy. Furthermore, we deploy Hybrid Learning (HL) to accelerate\nthe RL learning process and reduce the number of direct samplings. We\ndemonstrate efficacy of our HL strategy through experimental comparison with\nstate-of-the-art RL-based inference orchestration, demonstrating that our HL\nstrategy accelerates the learning process by up to 166.6x.",

    "abstract": "One fundamental challenge in building an instance segmentation model for a\nlarge number of classes in complex scenes is the lack of training examples,\nespecially for rare objects. In this paper, we explore the possibility to\nincrease the training examples without laborious data collection and\nannotation. We find that an abundance of instance segments can potentially be\nobtained freely from object-centric im-ages, according to two insights: (i) an\nobject-centric image usually contains one salient object in a simple\nbackground; (ii) objects from the same class often share similar appearances or\nsimilar contrasts to the background. Motivated by these insights, we propose a\nsimple and scalable framework FreeSeg for extracting and leveraging these\n\"free\" object foreground segments to facilitate model training in long-tailed\ninstance segmentation. Concretely, we employ off-the-shelf object foreground\nextraction techniques (e.g., image co-segmentation) to generate instance mask\ncandidates, followed by segments refinement and ranking. The resulting\nhigh-quality object segments can be used to augment the existing long-tailed\ndataset, e.g., by copying and pasting the segments onto the original training\nimages. On the LVIS benchmark, we show that FreeSeg yields substantial\nimprovements on top of strong baselines and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy\nfor segmenting rare object categories.",

In this paper, we consider modelling the interactions between\nbags using a graph and employ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to facilitate\nend-to-end learning. Since a meaningful graph representing dependencies between\nbags is rarely available, we propose to use a Bayesian GNN framework that can\ngenerate a likely graph structure for scenarios where there is uncertainty in\nthe graph or when no graph is available.

    "abstract": "Proper indoor ventilation through buildings' heating, ventilation, and air\nconditioning (HVAC) systems has become an increasing public health concern that\nsignificantly impacts individuals' health and safety at home, work, and school.\nWhile much work has progressed in providing energy-efficient and user comfort\nfor HVAC systems through IoT devices and mobile-sensing approaches, ventilation\nis an aspect that has received lesser attention despite its importance. With a\nmotivation to monitor airflow from building ventilation systems through\ncommodity sensing devices, we present FlowSense, a machine learning-based\nalgorithm to predict airflow rate from sensed audio data in indoor spaces. Our\nML technique can predict the state of an air vent-whether it is on or off-as\nwell as the rate of air flowing through active vents. By exploiting a low-pass\nfilter to obtain low-frequency audio signals, we put together a\nprivacy-preserving pipeline that leverages a silence detection algorithm to\nonly sense for sounds of air from HVAC air vent when no human speech is\ndetected. We also propose the Minimum Persistent Sensing (MPS) as a\npost-processing algorithm to reduce interference from ambient noise, including\nongoing human conversation, office machines, and traffic noises. Together,\nthese techniques ensure user privacy and improve the robustness of FlowSense.\nWe validate our approach yielding over 90% accuracy in predicting vent status\nand 0.96 MSE in predicting airflow rate when the device is placed within 2.25\nmeters away from an air vent. Additionally, we demonstrate how our approach as\na mobile audio-sensing platform is robust to smartphone models, distance, and\norientation.

    "abstract": "When humans control robot arms these robots often need to infer the human's\ndesired task. Prior research on assistive teleoperation and shared autonomy\nexplores how robots can determine the desired task based on the human's\njoystick inputs. In order to perform this inference the robot relies on an\ninternal mapping between joystick inputs and discrete tasks: e.g., pressing the\njoystick left indicates that the human wants a plate, while pressing the\njoystick right indicates a cup. This approach works well \\textit{after} the\nhuman understands how the robot interprets their inputs -- but inexperienced\nusers still have to learn these mappings through trial and error! Here we\nrecognize that the robot's mapping between tasks and inputs is a\n\\textit{convention}. There are multiple, equally efficient conventions that the\nrobot could use: rather than passively waiting for the human, we introduce a\nshared autonomy approach where the robot \\textit{actively reveals} its chosen\nconvention. Across repeated interactions the robot intervenes and exaggerates\nthe arm's motion to demonstrate more efficient inputs while also assisting for\nthe current task. We compare this approach to a state-of-the-art baseline --\nwhere users must identify the convention by themselves -- as well as written\ninstructions. Our user study results indicate that modifying the robot's\nbehavior to reveal its convention outperforms the baselines and reduces the\namount of time that humans spend controlling the robot.

    "abstract": "Introduction: Active commuting has been recommended as a method to increase\npopulation physical activity, but evidence is mixed. Social norms related to\ntravel behaviour may influence the uptake of active commuting interventions but\nare rarely considered in the design and evaluation of interventions.\nMethods: We developed an agent-based model that incorporates social norms\nrelated to travel behaviour and demonstrate the utility of this through\nimplementing car-free Wednesdays. A synthetic population of Waltham Forest,\nLondon, UK was generated using a microsimulation approach with data from the UK\nCensus 2011 and UK HLS datasets. An agent-based model was created using this\nsynthetic population which modelled how the actions of peers and neighbours,\nsubculture, habit, weather, bicycle ownership, car ownership, environmental\nsupportiveness, and congestion affect the decision to travel between four\nmodes: walking, cycling, driving, and taking public transport.\nResults: In the control scenario, the odds of active travel were plausible at\n0.091 (89% HPDI: [0.091, 0.091]). Compared to the control scenario, the odds of\nactive travel were increased by 70.3% (89% HPDI: [70.3%, 70.3%]), in the\nintervention scenario, on non-car-free days; the effect of the intervention is\nsustained to non-car-free days.\nDiscussion: While these results demonstrate the utility of our agent-based\nmodel, rather than aim to make accurate predictions, they do suggest that by\nthere being a 'nudge' of car-free days, there may be a sustained change in\nactive commuting behaviour. The model is a useful tool for investigating the\neffect of how social networks and social norms influence the effectiveness of\nvarious interventions. If configured using real-world built environment data,\nit may be useful for investigating how social norms interact with the built\nenvironment to cause the emergence of commuting conventions.",

However, specific database instances are not ideal for such\nobservations: they often include large amounts of superfluous details that are\nnot only irrelevant to understanding the query but also cause cognitive\noverload; and one specific database may not be enough. Given a relational\nquery, is it possible to provide a simple and generic \"representative\" instance\nthat (1) illustrates how the query can be satisfied, (2) summarizes all\nspecific instances that would satisfy the query in the same way by abstracting\naway unnecessary details? Furthermore, is it possible to find a collection of\nsuch representative instances that together completely characterize all\npossible ways in which the query can be satisfied? This paper takes initial\nsteps towards answering these questions. We design what these representative\ninstances look like, define what they stand for, and formalize what it means\nfor them to satisfy a query in \"all possible ways.\" We argue that this problem\nis undecidable for general domain relational calculus queries, and develop\npractical algorithms for computing a minimum collection of such instances\nsubject to other constraints.

We train sIPOMDPLite-net with expert demonstrations on\nsmall two-agent Tiger-grid tasks, for which it accurately learns the underlying\nI-POMDP Lite model and near-optimal policy, and the policy continues to perform\nwell on larger grids and real-world maps. As such, sIPOMDPLite-net shows good\ntransfer capabilities and offers a lighter learning and planning approach for\nindividual, self-interested agents in multiagent settings.",

    "abstract": "How does the mind organize thoughts? The hippocampal-entorhinal complex is\nthought to support domain-general representation and processing of structural\nknowledge of arbitrary state, feature and concept spaces. In particular, it\nenables the formation of cognitive maps, and navigation on these maps, thereby\nbroadly contributing to cognition. It has been proposed that the concept of\nmulti-scale successor representations provides an explanation of the underlying\ncomputations performed by place and grid cells. Here, we present a neural\nnetwork based approach to learn such representations, and its application to\ndifferent scenarios: a spatial exploration task based on supervised learning, a\nspatial navigation task based on reinforcement learning, and a non-spatial task\nwhere linguistic constructions have to be inferred by observing sample\nsentences. In all scenarios, the neural network correctly learns and\napproximates the underlying structure by building successor representations.\nFurthermore, the resulting neural firing patterns are strikingly similar to\nexperimentally observed place and grid cell firing patterns. We conclude that\ncognitive maps and neural network-based successor representations of structured\nknowledge provide a promising way to overcome some of the short comings of deep\nlearning towards artificial general intelligence.",

    "abstract": "By injecting a small number of poisoned samples into the training set,\nbackdoor attacks aim to make the victim model produce designed outputs on any\ninput injected with pre-designed backdoors. In order to achieve a high attack\nsuccess rate using as few poisoned training samples as possible, most existing\nattack methods change the labels of the poisoned samples to the target class.\nThis practice often results in severe over-fitting of the victim model over the\nbackdoors, making the attack quite effective in output control but easier to be\nidentified by human inspection or automatic defense algorithms.\nIn this work, we proposed a label-smoothing strategy to overcome the\nover-fitting problem of these attack methods, obtaining a\n\\textit{Label-Smoothed Backdoor Attack} (LSBA). In the LSBA, the label of the\npoisoned sample $\\bm{x}$ will be changed to the target class with a probability\nof $p_n(\\bm{x})$ instead of 100\\%, and the value of $p_n(\\bm{x})$ is\nspecifically designed to make the prediction probability the target class be\nonly slightly greater than those of the other classes. Empirical studies on\nseveral existing backdoor attacks show that our strategy can considerably\nimprove the stealthiness of these attacks and, at the same time, achieve a high\nattack success rate.

    "abstract": "A hierarchical Model Predictive Control (MPC) formulation is presented for\ncoupled discrete-time linear systems with state and input constraints. Compared\nto a centralized approach, a two-level hierarchical controller, with one\ncontroller in the upper-level and one controller per subsystem in the\nlower-level, can significantly reduce the computational cost associated with\nMPC. Hierarchical coordination is achieved using adjustable tubes, which are\noptimized by the upper-level controller and bound permissible lower-level\ncontroller deviations from the system trajectories determined by the\nupper-level controller. The size of these adjustable tubes determines the\ndegree of uncertainty between subsystems and directly affects the required\nconstraint tightening under a tube-based robust MPC framework. Sets are\nrepresented as zonotopes to enable the ability to optimize the size of these\nadjustable tubes and perform the necessary constraint tightening online as part\nof the MPC optimization problems. State and input constraint satisfaction is\nproven for the two-level hierarchical controller with an arbitrary number of\ncontrollers at the lower-level and a numerical example demonstrates the key\nfeatures and performance of the approach.",

With the success of\nDeep Convolutional Neural Network(DCNN), the fusion between DCNNs has been\nproved as a promising strategy to achieve satisfactory perception accuracy.\nHowever, mainstream existing DCNN fusion schemes conduct fusion by directly\nelement-wisely adding feature maps extracted from different modalities together\nat various stages, failing to consider whether the features being fused are\nmatched or not. Therefore, we first propose a feature disparity metric to\nquantitatively measure the degree of feature disparity between the feature maps\nbeing fused. We then propose Fusion-filter as a feature-matching techniques to\ntackle the feature-mismatching issue. We also propose a Layer-sharing technique\nin the deep layer that can achieve better accuracy with less computational\noverhead. Together with the help of the feature disparity to be an additional\nloss, our proposed technologies enable DCNN to learn corresponding feature maps\nwith similar characteristics and complementary visual context from different\nmodalities to achieve better accuracy.

This, in\nturn, frees the base encoder to focus on common classes, and improve its\nperformance thereon.

However, long-range\nnavigation requires both planning and reasoning about local traversability, as\nwell as being able to utilize information about global geography, in the form\nof a roadmap, GPS, or other side information, which provides important\nnavigational hints but may be low-fidelity or unreliable. In this work, we\npropose a learning-based approach that integrates learning and planning, and\ncan utilize side information such as schematic roadmaps, satellite maps and GPS\ncoordinates as a planning heuristic, without relying on them being accurate.\nOur method, ViKiNG, incorporates a local traversability model, which looks at\nthe robot's current camera observation and a potential subgoal to infer how\neasily that subgoal can be reached, as well as a heuristic model, which looks\nat overhead maps and attempts to estimate the distance to the destination for\nvarious subgoals. These models are used by a heuristic planner to decide the\nbest next subgoal in order to reach the final destination. Our method performs\nno explicit geometric reconstruction, utilizing only a topological\nrepresentation of the environment.

    "abstract": "While the deep learning-based image deraining methods have made great\nprogress in recent years, there are two major shortcomings in their application\nin real-world situations. Firstly, the gap between the low-level vision task\nrepresented by rain removal and the high-level vision task represented by\nobject detection is significant, and the low-level vision task can hardly\ncontribute to the high-level vision task. Secondly, the quality of the\nderaining dataset needs to be improved. In fact, the rain lines in many\nbaselines have a large gap with the real rain lines, and the resolution of the\nderaining dataset images is generally not ideally. Meanwhile, there are few\ncommon datasets for both the low-level vision task and the high-level vision\ntask. In this paper, we explore the combination of the low-level vision task\nwith the high-level vision task. Specifically, we propose an end-to-end object\ndetection network for reducing the impact of rainfall, which consists of two\ncascaded networks, an improved image deraining network and an object detection\nnetwork, respectively. We also design the components of the loss function to\naccommodate the characteristics of the different sub-networks.

In this paper, we propose a\nneighborhood consensus based reliable inlier evaluation method for robust\nunsupervised point cloud registration. It is expected to capture the\ndiscriminative geometric difference between the source neighborhood and the\ncorresponding pseudo target neighborhood for effective inlier distinction.\nSpecifically, our model consists of a matching map refinement module and an\ninlier evaluation module. In our matching map refinement module, we improve the\npoint-wise matching map estimation by integrating the matching scores of\nneighbors into it. The aggregated neighborhood information potentially\nfacilitates the discriminative map construction so that high-quality\ncorrespondences can be provided for generating the pseudo target point cloud.\nBased on the observation that the outlier has the significant structure-wise\ndifference between its source neighborhood and corresponding pseudo target\nneighborhood while this difference for inlier is small, the inlier evaluation\nmodule exploits this difference to score the inlier confidence for each\nestimated correspondence. In particular, we construct an effective graph\nrepresentation for capturing this geometric difference between the\nneighborhoods. Finally, with the learned correspondences and the corresponding\ninlier confidence, we use the weighted SVD algorithm for transformation\nestimation. Under the unsupervised setting, we exploit the Huber function based\nglobal alignment loss, the local neighborhood consensus loss, and spatial\nconsistency loss for model optimization.

EWC was originally introduced in the setting of machine learning of\nsequential multi-tasks with the aim of avoiding catastrophic forgetting issue,\nwhich equally poses as a major challenge in multimode dynamic process\nmonitoring. When a new mode arrives, a set of data should be collected so that\nthis mode can be identified by PSFA and prior knowledge. Then, a regularization\nterm is introduced to prevent new data from significantly interfering with the\nlearned knowledge, where the parameter importance measures are estimated. The\nproposed method is denoted as PSFA-EWC, which is updated continually and\ncapable of achieving excellent performance for successive modes. Different from\ntraditional multimode monitoring algorithms, PSFA-EWC furnishes backward and\nforward transfer ability. The significant features of previous modes are\nretained while consolidating new information, which may contribute to learning\nnew relevant modes.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a motion planning strategy for UAVs that generates\na time-optimal trajectory to survey a given target area. There are several\nsituations where completing an aerial survey is time sensitive, such as gaining\nsituational awareness for first responders, surveying hazardous environments,\netc. One of the challenges in such cases is to plan a time-optimal trajectory\nfor the drone. To this end, we present an autonomous aerial survey framework\nthat minimizes the time taken to completely explore a target area or volume\nusing drones. In this work, (i) we present an approach, where for a known\nflight survey pattern, the planner can generate time-optimal flight paths in\n3-D (ii) we frame the planning problem as a discrete non-linear program, and\nreduce the time taken to compute its solution by using an SOCP relaxation (iii)\nThe given path is then executed using a simple trajectory tracking controller\non a quadrotor to demonstrate its capability on hardware.",

Next, through an empirical investigation of Pull Requests\n(PRs) in 37 Apache Projects, we build a classifier to extract implicit\nmentoring and characterize it through the dual lenses of experience and gender.\nOur analysis of 107,895 PRs shows that implicit mentoring occurs (27.41% of all\nPRs include implicit mentoring) and it does not follow the traditional dyadic,\ntop-down apprenticeship model.

This directed the efforts to developing many\nstate-of-the-art systems, creating challenging datasets, and introducing\nrigorous metrics to measure SLAM system performance. However, the link between\ndatasets and performance in the robustness/resilience context has rarely been\nexplored. In order to fill this void, characterization the operating conditions\nof SLAM systems is essential in order to provide an environment for\nquantitative measurement of robustness and resilience. In this paper, we argue\nthat for proper evaluation of SLAM performance, the characterization of SLAM\ndatasets serves as a critical first step. The study starts by reviewing\nprevious efforts for quantitative characterization of SLAM datasets. Then, the\nproblem of perturbations characterization is discussed and the linkage to SLAM\nrobustness/resilience is established. After that, we propose a novel, generic\nand extendable framework for quantitative analysis and comparison of SLAM\ndatasets. Additionally, a description of different characterization parameters\nis provided. Finally, we demonstrate the application of our framework by\npresenting the characterization results of three SLAM datasets: KITTI,\nEuroC-MAV, and TUM-VI highlighting the level of insights achieved by the\nproposed framework.",

Despite these appealing properties, the\ncomputation of more complex inference tasks, such as the cumulative\ndistribution function (CDF) over a complex region (e.g., a polytope) remains\nchallenging. Traditional CDF approximations using Monte-Carlo techniques are\nunbiased but have unbounded variance and low sample efficiency.

We describe both deterministic and stochastic instances of this\nestimator: while the deterministic variant iteratively improves the estimate by\nstrategically subdividing the boundary, the stochastic variant provides\nunbiased estimates.

The\ndistribution mismatch problem leading to unstable learning process is addressed\nby SGAC in a DAgger manner.

    "abstract": "With the introduction of Navigation Message Authentication (NMA), future\nGlobal Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs) prevent spoofing by simulation,\ni.e., the generation of forged satellite signals based on public information.\nHowever, authentication does not prevent record-and-replay attacks, commonly\ntermed as meaconing. These attacks are less powerful in terms of adversarial\ncontrol over the victim receiver location and time, but by acting at the signal\nlevel, they are not thwarted by NMA. This makes replaying/relaying attacks a\nsignificant threat for GNSS. While there are numerous investigations on\nmeaconing, the majority does not rely on actual implementation and experimental\nevaluation in real-world settings. In this work, we contribute to the\nimprovement of the experimental understanding of meaconing attacks. We design\nand implement a system capable of real-time, distributed, and mobile meaconing,\nbuilt with off-the-shelf hardware. We extend from basic distributed attacks,\nwith signals from different locations relayed over the Internet and replayed\nwithin range of the victim receiver(s): this has high bandwidth requirements\nand thus depends on the quality of service of the available network to work. To\novercome this limitation, we propose to replay on message level, including the\nauthentication part of the payload. The resultant reduced bandwidth enables the\nattacker to operate in mobile scenarios, as well as to replay signals from\nmultiple GNSS constellations and/or bands simultaneously. Additionally, the\nattacker can delay individually selected satellite signals to potentially\ninfluence the victim position and time solution in a more fine-grained manner.\nOur versatile test-bench, enabling different types of replaying/relaying\nattacks, facilitates testing realistic scenarios towards new and improved\nreplaying/relaying-focused countermeasures in GNSS receivers.",

In particular, physics informed learning approaches already seem to\nprogressively gradually replace carefully hand-crafted reconstruction\nalgorithms, for their superior quality. The aim of this paper is twofold. First\nwe show a significant weakness of these networks: they do not adapt efficiently\nto variations of the forward model. Second, we show that training the network\nwith a family of forward operators allows to solve the adaptivity problem\nwithout compromising the reconstruction quality significantly.

    "abstract": "In the short text, the extreme short length, feature sparsity and high\nambiguity pose huge challenge to classification tasks. Recently, as an\neffective method for tuning Pre-trained Language Models for specific downstream\ntasks, prompt-learning has attracted vast amount of attention and research. The\nmain intuition behind the prompt-learning is to insert template into the input\nand convert the text classification tasks into equivalent cloze-style tasks.\nHowever, most prompt-learning methods expand label words manually or only\nconsider the class name for knowledge incorporating in cloze-style prediction,\nwhich will inevitably incurred omissions and bias in classification tasks. In\nthis paper, we propose a simple short text classification approach that makes\nuse of prompt-learning based on knowledgeable expansion, which can consider\nboth the short text itself and class name during expanding label words space.\nSpecifically, the top $N$ concepts related to the entity in short text are\nretrieved from the open Knowledge Graph like Probase, and we further refine the\nexpanded label words by the distance calculation between selected concepts and\nclass label. Experimental results show that our approach obtains obvious\nimprovement compared with other fine-tuning, prompt-learning and knowledgeable\nprompt-tuning methods, outperforming the state-of-the-art by up to 6 Accuracy\npoints on three well-known datasets.",

    "abstract": "Accurate recommendation and reliable explanation are two key issues for\nmodern recommender systems. However, most recommendation benchmarks only\nconcern the prediction of user-item ratings while omitting the underlying\ncauses behind the ratings. For example, the widely-used Yahoo!R3 dataset\ncontains little information on the causes of the user-movie ratings. A solution\ncould be to conduct surveys and require the users to provide such information.\nIn practice, the user surveys can hardly avoid compliance issues and sparse\nuser responses, which greatly hinders the exploration of causality-based\nrecommendation. To better support the studies of causal inference and further\nexplanations in recommender systems, we propose a novel semi-synthetic data\ngeneration framework for recommender systems where causal graphical models with\nmissingness are employed to describe the causal mechanism of practical\nrecommendation scenarios. To illustrate the use of our framework, we construct\na semi-synthetic dataset with Causal Tags And Ratings (CTAR), based on the\nmovies as well as their descriptive tags and rating information collected from\na famous movie rating website. Using the collected data and the causal graph,\nthe user-item-ratings and their corresponding user-item-tags are automatically\ngenerated, which provides the reasons (selected tags) why the user rates the\nitems.

    "abstract": "Transformer-based methods have shown great potential in long-term time series\nforecasting. However, most of these methods adopt the standard point-wise\nself-attention mechanism, which not only becomes intractable for long-term\nforecasting since its complexity increases quadratically with the length of\ntime series, but also cannot explicitly capture the predictive dependencies\nfrom contexts since the corresponding key and value are transformed from the\nsame point. This paper proposes a predictive Transformer-based model called\n{\\em Preformer}. Preformer introduces a novel efficient {\\em Multi-Scale\nSegment-Correlation} mechanism that divides time series into segments and\nutilizes segment-wise correlation-based attention for encoding time series. A\nmulti-scale structure is developed to aggregate dependencies at different\ntemporal scales and facilitate the selection of segment length. Preformer\nfurther designs a predictive paradigm for decoding, where the key and value\ncome from two successive segments rather than the same segment. In this way, if\na key segment has a high correlation score with the query segment, its\nsuccessive segment contributes more to the prediction of the query segment.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our Preformer outperforms other\nTransformer-based methods.",

To solve the problem, we propose a\nmulti-modality feature fusion network to combine the modalities of the skeleton\nsequence and RGB frame instead of the RGB video, as the key information\ncontained by the combination of skeleton sequence and RGB frame is close to\nthat of the skeleton sequence and RGB video.

To\nbetter explore the correspondence of the two modalities, a two-stage fusion\nframework is introduced in the network. In the early fusion stage, we introduce\na skeleton attention module that projects the skeleton sequence on the single\nRGB frame to help the RGB frame focus on the limb movement regions. In the late\nfusion stage, we propose a cross-attention module to fuse the skeleton feature\nand the RGB feature by exploiting the correlation.

This work proposes to\nleverage machine learning algorithms to optimize traffic flow at urban\nintersections by jointly planning for multiple vehicles. Learning-based\nbehavior planning poses several challenges, demanding for a suited input and\noutput representation as well as large amounts of ground-truth data. We address\nthe former issue by using a flexible graph-based input representation\naccompanied by a graph neural network. This allows to efficiently encode the\nscene and inherently provide individual outputs for all involved vehicles. To\nlearn a sensible policy, without relying on the imitation of expert\ndemonstrations, the cooperative planning task is phrased as a reinforcement\nlearning problem. We train and evaluate the proposed method in an open-source\nsimulation environment for decision making in automated driving. Compared to a\nfirst-in-first-out scheme and traffic governed by static priority rules, the\nlearned planner shows a significant gain in flow rate, while reducing the\nnumber of induced stops.

Traditional sequence-based approaches\nsuch as propagating neighboring information to gradually fill in the missing\nregions are cost-effective. But they generate less satisfactory outcomes when\ndealing with larger missing regions and texture-rich structures. Emerging deep\nlearning-based methods such as encoder-decoder networks have shown promising\nresults in natural image inpainting tasks. However, they typically need a long\ncomputational time for network training in addition to the high demand on the\nsize of datasets, which makes it difficult to be applied on often small medical\ndatasets. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale shadow\ninpainting framework for OCT images by synergically applying sparse\nrepresentation and deep learning: sparse representation is used to extract\nfeatures from a small amount of training images for further inpainting and to\nregularize the image after the multi-scale image fusion, while convolutional\nneural network (CNN) is employed to enhance the image quality. During the image\ninpainting, we divide preprocessed input images into different branches based\non the shadow width to harvest complementary information from different scales.\nFinally, a sparse representation-based regularizing module is designed to\nrefine the generated contents after multi-scale feature aggregation.\nExperiments are conducted to compare our proposal versus both traditional and\ndeep learning-based techniques on synthetic and real-world shadows.

    "abstract": "Incremental learning methods can learn new classes continually by distilling\nknowledge from the last model (as a teacher model) to the current model (as a\nstudent model) in the sequentially learning process. However, these methods\ncannot work for Incremental Implicitly-Refined Classification (IIRC), an\nincremental learning extension where the incoming classes could have two\ngranularity levels, a superclass label and a subclass label. This is because\nthe previously learned superclass knowledge may be occupied by the subclass\nknowledge learned sequentially. To solve this problem, we propose a novel\nMulti-Teacher Knowledge Distillation (MTKD) strategy. To preserve the subclass\nknowledge, we use the last model as a general teacher to distill the previous\nknowledge for the student model. To preserve the superclass knowledge, we use\nthe initial model as a superclass teacher to distill the superclass knowledge\nas the initial model contains abundant superclass knowledge. However,\ndistilling knowledge from two teacher models could result in the student model\nmaking some redundant predictions. We further propose a post-processing\nmechanism, called as Top-k prediction restriction to reduce the redundant\npredictions. Our experimental results on IIRC-ImageNet120 and IIRC-CIFAR100\nshow that the proposed method can achieve better classification accuracy\ncompared with existing state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Consensus protocols are widely used in building reliable distributed software\nsystems and its correctness is of vital importance. TLA+ is a lightweight\nformal specification language which enables precise specification of system\ndesign and exhaustive checking of the design without any human effort. The\nfeatures of TLA+ make it widely used in the specification and model checking of\nconsensus protocols, both in academia and industry. However, the application of\nTLA+ is limited by the state explosion problem in model checking. Though\ncompositional model checking is essential to tame the state explosion problem,\nexisting compositional checking techniques do not sufficiently consider the\ncharacteristics of TLA+.\nIn this work, we propose the Interaction-Preserving Abstraction (IPA)\nframework, which leverages the features of TLA+ and enables practical and\nefficient compositional model checking of consensus protocols specified in\nTLA+. In the IPA framework, system specification is partitioned into multiple\nmodules, and each module is divided to the internal part and the interaction\npart. The basic idea of the interaction-preserving abstraction is to omit the\ninternal part of each module, such that another module cannot distinguish\nwhether it is interacting with the original module or the coarsened abstract\none.\nWe use the IPA framework to the compositional checking of the TLA+\nspecification of two consensus protocols Raft and ParallelRaft. Raft is a\nconsensus protocol which is originally developed in the academia and then\nwidely used in industry. ParallelRaft is the replication protocol in PolarFS,\nthe distributed file system for the commercial database Alibaba PoloarDB. We\ndemonstrate that the IPA framework is easy to use in realistic scenarios and at\nthe same time significantly reduces the model checking cost.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel deep metric learning-based semi-supervised\nregression (DML-S2R) method for parameter estimation problems. The proposed\nDML-S2R method aims to mitigate the problems of insufficient amount of labeled\nsamples without collecting any additional samples with target values. To this\nend, the proposed DML-S2R method is made up of two main steps: i) pairwise\nsimilarity modeling with scarce labeled data; and ii) triplet-based metric\nlearning with abundant unlabeled data. The first step aims to model pairwise\nsample similarities by using a small number of labeled samples. This is\nachieved by estimating the target value differences of labeled samples with a\nSiamese neural network (SNN). The second step aims to learn a triplet-based\nmetric space (in which similar samples are close to each other and dissimilar\nsamples are far apart from each other) when the number of labeled samples is\ninsufficient. This is achieved by employing the SNN of the first step for\ntriplet-based deep metric learning that exploits not only labeled samples but\nalso unlabeled samples. For the end-to-end training of DML-S2R, we investigate\nan alternate learning strategy for the two steps. Due to this strategy, the\nencoded information in each step becomes a guidance for learning the other\nstep. The experimental results confirm the success of DML-S2R compared to the\nstate-of-the-art semi-supervised regression methods.

Nevertheless, they usually neglect the diversity of the user's intents\non adopting items and fail to disentangle the user's intents in\nrepresentations. In the real scenario of bundle recommendation, a user's intent\nmay be naturally distributed in the different bundles of that user (Global\nview), while a bundle may contain multiple intents of a user (Local view). Each\nview has its advantages for intent disentangling: 1) From the global view, more\nitems are involved to present each intent, which can demonstrate the user's\npreference under each intent more clearly. 2) From the local view, it can\nreveal the association among items under each intent since items within the\nsame bundle are highly correlated to each other.

    "abstract": "Due to the availability of multi-modal remote sensing (RS) image archives,\none of the most important research topics is the development of cross-modal RS\nimage retrieval (CM-RSIR) methods that search semantically similar images\nacross different modalities. Existing CM-RSIR methods require annotated\ntraining images (which is time-consuming, costly and not feasible to gather in\nlarge-scale applications) and do not concurrently address intra- and\ninter-modal similarity preservation and inter-modal discrepancy elimination. In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel self-supervised cross-modal image retrieval\nmethod that aims to: i) model mutual-information between different modalities\nin a self-supervised manner; ii) retain the distributions of modal-specific\nfeature spaces similar; and iii) define most similar images within each\nmodality without requiring any annotated training images. To this end, we\npropose a novel objective including three loss functions that simultaneously:\ni) maximize mutual information of different modalities for inter-modal\nsimilarity preservation; ii) minimize the angular distance of multi-modal image\ntuples for the elimination of inter-modal discrepancies; and iii) increase\ncosine similarity of most similar images within each modality for the\ncharacterization of intra-modal similarities. Experimental results show the\neffectiveness of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art methods. The\ncode of the proposed method is publicly available at\nhttps://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/SS-CM-RSIR.",

    "title": "DL-SLOT: Dynamic Lidar SLAM and Object Tracking Based On Graph  Optimization",
    "abstract": "Ego-pose estimation and dynamic object tracking are two key issues in an\nautonomous driving system. Two assumptions are often made for them, i.e. the\nstatic world assumption of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and the\nexact ego-pose assumption of object tracking, respectively. However, these\nassumptions are difficult to hold in highly dynamic road scenarios where SLAM\nand object tracking become correlated and mutually beneficial. In this paper,\nDL-SLOT, a dynamic Lidar SLAM and object tracking method is proposed. This\nmethod integrates the state estimations of both the ego vehicle and the static\nand dynamic objects in the environment into a unified optimization framework,\nto realize SLAM and object tracking (SLOT) simultaneously. Firstly, we\nimplement object detection to remove all the points that belong to potential\ndynamic objects. Then, LiDAR odometry is conducted using the filtered point\ncloud. At the same time, detected objects are associated with the history\nobject trajectories based on the time-series information in a sliding window.\nThe states of the static and dynamic objects and ego vehicle in the sliding\nwindow are integrated into a unified local optimization framework. We perform\nSLAM and object tracking simultaneously in this framework, which significantly\nimproves the robustness and accuracy of SLAM in highly dynamic road scenarios\nand the accuracy of objects' states estimation. Experiments on public datasets\nhave shown that our method achieves better accuracy than A-LOAM.",

    "abstract": "The Dynamic Mode Decomposition has proved to be a very efficient technique to\nstudy dynamic data. This is entirely a data-driven approach that extracts all\nnecessary information from data snapshots which are commonly supposed to be\nsampled from measurement. The application of this approach becomes problematic\nif the available data is incomplete because some dimensions of smaller scale\neither missing or unmeasured. Such setting occurs very often in modeling\ncomplex dynamical systems such as power grids, in particular with reduced-order\nmodeling. To take into account the effect of unresolved variables the optimal\nprediction approach based on the Mori-Zwanzig formalism can be applied to\nobtain the most expected prediction under existing uncertainties. This\neffectively leads to the development of a time-predictive model accounting for\nthe impact of missing data. In the present paper we provide a detailed\nderivation of the considered method from the Liouville equation and finalize it\nwith the optimization problem that defines the optimal transition operator\ncorresponding to the observed data. In contrast to the existing approach, we\nconsider a first-order approximation of the Mori-Zwanzig decomposition, state\nthe corresponding optimization problem and solve it with the gradient-based\noptimization method. The gradient of the obtained objective function is\ncomputed precisely through the automatic differentiation technique. The\nnumerical experiments illustrate that the considered approach gives practically\nthe same dynamics as the exact Mori-Zwanzig decomposition, but is less\ncomputationally intensive.",

Thus, it is imperative to understand how\nolder adults interact with and comprehend online COVID-19 interactive\nvisualizations and what challenges they might encounter to make such\nvisualizations more accessible to older adults. We adopted a user-centered\napproach by inviting older adults to interact with COVID-19 interactive\nvisualizations while at the same time verbalizing their thought processes using\na think-aloud protocol. By analyzing their think-aloud verbalizations, we\nidentified four types of thought processes representing how older adults\ncomprehended the visualizations and uncovered the challenges they encountered.\nFurthermore, we also identified the challenges they encountered with seven\ncommon types of interaction techniques adopted by the visualizations.

    "abstract": "We introduce an adaptive tree search algorithm, that can find high-scoring\noutputs under translation models that make no assumptions about the form or\nstructure of the search objective. This algorithm -- a deterministic variant of\nMonte Carlo tree search -- enables the exploration of new kinds of models that\nare unencumbered by constraints imposed to make decoding tractable, such as\nautoregressivity or conditional independence assumptions. When applied to\nautoregressive models, our algorithm has different biases than beam search has,\nwhich enables a new analysis of the role of decoding bias in autoregressive\nmodels. Empirically, we show that our adaptive tree search algorithm finds\noutputs with substantially better model scores compared to beam search in\nautoregressive models, and compared to reranking techniques in models whose\nscores do not decompose additively with respect to the words in the output. We\nalso characterise the correlation of several translation model objectives with\nrespect to BLEU. We find that while some standard models are poorly calibrated\nand benefit from the beam search bias, other often more robust models\n(autoregressive models tuned to maximize expected automatic metric scores, the\nnoisy channel model and a newly proposed objective) benefit from increasing\namounts of search using our proposed decoder, whereas the beam search bias\nlimits the improvements obtained from such objectives. Thus, we argue that as\nmodels improve, the improvements may be masked by over-reliance on beam search\nor reranking based methods.",

While most of the existing work focuses on the monolingual prompts, we\nstudy the multilingual prompts for multilingual PLMs, especially in the\nzero-shot cross-lingual setting. To alleviate the effort of designing different\nprompts for multiple languages, we propose a novel model that uses a unified\nprompt for all languages, called UniPrompt. Different from the discrete prompts\nand soft prompts, the unified prompt is model-based and language-agnostic.\nSpecifically, the unified prompt is initialized by a multilingual PLM to\nproduce language-independent representation, after which is fused with the text\ninput. During inference, the prompts can be pre-computed so that no extra\ncomputation cost is needed. To collocate with the unified prompt, we propose a\nnew initialization method for the target label word to further improve the\nmodel's transferability across languages.

However,\ndespite the progress made in device-heterogeneous federated learning scenarios,\nthe heterogeneity in the bitwidth specifications in the hardware has been\nmostly overlooked. We introduce a pragmatic FL scenario with bitwidth\nheterogeneity across the participating devices, dubbed as Bitwidth\nHeterogeneous Federated Learning (BHFL). BHFL brings in a new challenge, that\nthe aggregation of model parameters with different bitwidths could result in\nsevere performance degeneration, especially for high-bitwidth models. To tackle\nthis problem, we propose ProWD framework, which has a trainable weight\ndequantizer at the central server that progressively reconstructs the\nlow-bitwidth weights into higher bitwidth weights, and finally into\nfull-precision weights. ProWD further selectively aggregates the model\nparameters to maximize the compatibility across bit-heterogeneous weights. We\nvalidate ProWD against relevant FL baselines on the benchmark datasets, using\nclients with varying bitwidths. Our ProWD largely outperforms the baseline FL\nalgorithms as well as naive approaches (e.g. grouped averaging) under the\nproposed BHFL scenario.",

    "abstract": "Large amounts of labeled data are urgently required for the training of\nrobust text recognizers. However, collecting handwriting data of diverse\nstyles, along with an immense lexicon, is considerably expensive. Although data\nsynthesis is a promising way to relieve data hunger, two key issues of\nhandwriting synthesis, namely, style representation and content embedding,\nremain unsolved. To this end, we propose a novel method that can synthesize\nparameterized and controllable handwriting Styles for arbitrary-Length and\nOut-of-vocabulary text based on a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), termed\nSLOGAN. Specifically, we propose a style bank to parameterize the specific\nhandwriting styles as latent vectors, which are input to a generator as style\npriors to achieve the corresponding handwritten styles. The training of the\nstyle bank requires only the writer identification of the source images, rather\nthan attribute annotations. Moreover, we embed the text content by providing an\neasily obtainable printed style image, so that the diversity of the content can\nbe flexibly achieved by changing the input printed image. Finally, the\ngenerator is guided by dual discriminators to handle both the handwriting\ncharacteristics that appear as separated characters and in a series of cursive\njoins. Our method can synthesize words that are not included in the training\nvocabulary and with various new styles. Extensive experiments have shown that\nhigh-quality text images with great style diversity and rich vocabulary can be\nsynthesized using our method, thereby enhancing the robustness of the\nrecognizer.",

Movement\ncharacteristics (exit flows, speeds) and human behaviour (pre-movement\nactivities, exiting behaviours) were also analysed.\nThe data obtained was used to validate and adjust a Pathfinder model to\ncapture important aspects of evacuation from the railcar. Furthermore, a series\nof simulations using this model was performed to provide sensitivity analysis\nof the influence of crowd composition, exit width, and exit type on total\nevacuation time. As a key finding, we can conclude that for the case of a\nstandard exit path (platform or stairs) the width of the main exit had the\ngreatest impact on total evacuation time, however, crowd composition played the\nprevailing role in evacuation scenarios involving a jump.",

    "title": "The Tiny-Tasks Granularity Trade-Off: Balancing overhead vs. performance  in parallel systems",
    "abstract": "Models of parallel processing systems typically assume that one has $l$\nworkers and jobs are split into an equal number of $k=l$ tasks. Splitting jobs\ninto $k > l$ smaller tasks, i.e. using ``tiny tasks'', can yield performance\nand stability improvements because it reduces the variance in the amount of\nwork assigned to each worker, but as $k$ increases, the overhead involved in\nscheduling and managing the tasks begins to overtake the performance benefit.\nWe perform extensive experiments on the effects of task granularity on an\nApache Spark cluster, and based on these, developed a four-parameter model for\ntask and job overhead that, in simulation, produces sojourn time distributions\nthat match those of the real system. We also present analytical results which\nillustrate how using tiny tasks improves the stability region of split-merge\nsystems, and analytical bounds on the sojourn and waiting time distributions of\nboth split-merge and single-queue fork-join systems with tiny tasks. Finally we\ncombine the overhead model with the analytical models to produce an analytical\napproximation to the sojourn and waiting time distributions of systems with\ntiny tasks which include overhead. Though no longer strict analytical bounds,\nthese approximations matched the Spark experimental results very well in both\nthe split-merge and fork-join cases.",

To tackle this, we propose NEUROSEQRET which learns to retrieve and\nrank a relevant set of continuous-time event sequences for a given query\nsequence, from a large corpus of sequences.

Next, it feeds the unwarped query\nsequence and the corpus sequence into MTPP guided neural relevance models.

To tackle these problems with less human efforts,\nautomated machine learning becomes popular in finding various neural\narchitectures that fit diverse Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT)\nscenarios. Recently, to prevent the leakage of private information while enable\nautomated machine intelligence, there is an emerging trend to integrate\nfederated learning and neural architecture search (NAS). Although promising as\nit may seem, the coupling of difficulties from both tenets makes the algorithm\ndevelopment quite challenging. In particular, how to efficiently search the\noptimal neural architecture directly from massive non-independent and\nidentically distributed (non-IID) data among AIoT devices in a federated manner\nis a hard nut to crack. In this paper, to tackle this challenge, by leveraging\nthe advances in ProxylessNAS, we propose a Federated Direct Neural Architecture\nSearch (FDNAS) framework that allows for hardware-friendly NAS from non- IID\ndata across devices. To further adapt to both various data distributions and\ndifferent types of devices with heterogeneous embedded hardware platforms,\ninspired by meta-learning, a Cluster Federated Direct Neural Architecture\nSearch (CFDNAS) framework is proposed to achieve device-aware NAS, in the sense\nthat each device can learn a tailored deep learning model for its particular\ndata distribution and hardware constraint.

    "abstract": "In Joint Communication and Radar (JCR)-based Autonomous Vehicle (AV) systems,\noptimizing waveform structure is one of the most challenging tasks due to\nstrong influences between radar and data communication functions. Specifically,\nthe preamble of a data communication frame is typically leveraged for the radar\nfunction. As such, the higher number of preambles in a Coherent Processing\nInterval (CPI) is, the greater radar's performance is. In contrast,\ncommunication efficiency decreases as the number of preambles increases.\nMoreover, AVs' surrounding radio environments are usually dynamic with high\nuncertainties due to their high mobility, making the JCR's waveform\noptimization problem even more challenging. To that end, this paper develops a\nnovel JCR framework based on the Markov decision process framework and recent\nadvanced techniques in deep reinforcement learning. By doing so, without\nrequiring complete knowledge of the surrounding environment in advance, the\nJCR-AV can adaptively optimize its waveform structure (i.e., number of frames\nin the CPI) to maximize radar and data communication performance under the\nsurrounding environment's dynamic and uncertainty.

    "title": "GIFT: Graph-guIded Feature Transfer for Cold-Start Video Click-Through  Rate Prediction",
    "abstract": "Short video has witnessed rapid growth in China and shows a promising market\nfor promoting the sales of products in e-commerce platforms like Taobao. To\nensure the freshness of the content, the platform needs to release a large\nnumber of new videos every day, which makes the conventional click-through rate\n(CTR) prediction model suffer from the severe item cold-start problem. In this\npaper, we propose GIFT, an efficient Graph-guIded Feature Transfer system, to\nfully take advantages of the rich information of warmed-up videos that related\nto the cold-start video. More specifically, we conduct feature transfer from\nwarmed-up videos to those cold-start ones by involving the physical and\nsemantic linkages into a heterogeneous graph. The former linkages consist of\nthose explicit relationships (e.g., sharing the same category, under the same\nauthorship etc.), while the latter measure the proximity of multimodal\nrepresentations of two videos. In practice, the style, content, and even the\nrecommendation pattern are pretty similar among those physically or\nsemantically related videos. Besides, in order to provide the robust id\nrepresentations and historical statistics obtained from warmed-up neighbors\nthat cold-start videos covet most, we elaborately design the transfer function\nto make aware of different transferred features from different types of nodes\nand edges along the metapath on the graph. Extensive experiments on a large\nreal-world dataset show that our GIFT system outperforms SOTA methods\nsignificantly and brings a 6.82% lift on click-through rate (CTR) in the\nhomepage of Taobao App.",

    "title": "A new LDA formulation with covariates",
    "abstract": "The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model is a popular method for creating\nmixed-membership clusters. Despite having been originally developed for text\nanalysis, LDA has been used for a wide range of other applications. We propose\na new formulation for the LDA model which incorporates covariates. In this\nmodel, a negative binomial regression is embedded within LDA, enabling\nstraight-forward interpretation of the regression coefficients and the analysis\nof the quantity of cluster-specific elements in each sampling units (instead of\nthe analysis being focused on modeling the proportion of each cluster, as in\nStructural Topic Models). We use slice sampling within a Gibbs sampling\nalgorithm to estimate model parameters. We rely on simulations to show how our\nalgorithm is able to successfully retrieve the true parameter values and the\nability to make predictions for the abundance matrix using the information\ngiven by the covariates. The model is illustrated using real data sets from\nthree different areas: text-mining of Coronavirus articles, analysis of grocery\nshopping baskets, and ecology of tree species on Barro Colorado Island\n(Panama). This model allows the identification of mixed-membership clusters in\ndiscrete data and provides inference on the relationship between covariates and\nthe abundance of these clusters.",

    "title": "Inference of Affordances and Active Motor Control in Simulated Agents",
    "abstract": "Flexible, goal-directed behavior is a fundamental aspect of human life. Based\non the free energy minimization principle, the theory of active inference\nformalizes the generation of such behavior from a computational neuroscience\nperspective. Based on the theory, we introduce an output-probabilistic,\ntemporally predictive, modular artificial neural network architecture, which\nprocesses sensorimotor information, infers behavior-relevant aspects of its\nworld, and invokes highly flexible, goal-directed behavior. We show that our\narchitecture, which is trained end-to-end to minimize an approximation of free\nenergy, develops latent states that can be interpreted as affordance maps. That\nis, the emerging latent states signal which actions lead to which effects\ndependent on the local context. In combination with active inference, we show\nthat flexible, goal-directed behavior can be invoked, incorporating the\nemerging affordance maps. As a result, our simulated agent flexibly steers\nthrough continuous spaces, avoids collisions with obstacles, and prefers\npathways that lead to the goal with high certainty. Additionally, we show that\nthe learned agent is highly suitable for zero-shot generalization across\nenvironments: After training the agent in a handful of fixed environments with\nobstacles and other terrains affecting its behavior, it performs similarly well\nin procedurally generated environments containing different amounts of\nobstacles and terrains of various sizes at different locations. To improve and\nfocus model learning further, we plan to invoke active inference-based,\ninformation-gain-oriented behavior also while learning the temporally\npredictive model itself in the near future. Moreover, we intend to foster the\ndevelopment of both deeper event-predictive abstractions and compact, habitual\nbehavioral primitives.",

    "title": "On Computing the $k$-Shortcut Fr\u00e9chet Distance",
    "abstract": "The Fr\\'echet distance is a popular measure of dissimilarity for polygonal\ncurves. It is defined as a min-max formulation that considers all\ndirection-preserving continuous bijections of the two curves. Because of its\nsusceptibility to noise, Driemel and Har-Peled introduced the shortcut\nFr\\'echet distance in 2012, where one is allowed to take shortcuts along one of\nthe curves, similar to the edit distance for sequences. We analyse the\nparameterized version of this problem, where the number of shortcuts is bounded\nby a parameter $k$. The corresponding decision problem can be stated as\nfollows: Given two polygonal curves $T$ and $B$ of at most $n$ vertices, a\nparameter $k$ and a distance threshold $\\delta$, is it possible to introduce\n$k$ shortcuts along $B$ such that the Fr\\'echet distance of the resulting curve\nand the curve $T$ is at most $\\delta$? We study this problem for polygonal\ncurves in the plane. We provide a complexity analysis for this problem with the\nfollowing results: (i) assuming the exponential-time-hypothesis (ETH), there\nexists no algorithm with running time bounded by $n^{o(k)}$; (ii) there exists\na decision algorithm with running time in $O(kn^{2k+2}\\log n)$. In contrast, we\nalso show that efficient approximate decider algorithms are possible, even when\n$k$ is large. We present a $(3+\\varepsilon)$-approximate decider algorithm with\nrunning time in $O(k n^2 \\log^2 n)$ for fixed $\\varepsilon$. In addition, we\ncan show that, if $k$ is a constant and the two curves are $c$-packed for some\nconstant $c$, then the approximate decider algorithm runs in near-linear time.",

    "title": "Self-Supervised Transformers for Unsupervised Object Discovery using  Normalized Cut",
    "abstract": "Transformers trained with self-supervised learning using self-distillation\nloss (DINO) have been shown to produce attention maps that highlight salient\nforeground objects. In this paper, we demonstrate a graph-based approach that\nuses the self-supervised transformer features to discover an object from an\nimage. Visual tokens are viewed as nodes in a weighted graph with edges\nrepresenting a connectivity score based on the similarity of tokens. Foreground\nobjects can then be segmented using a normalized graph-cut to group\nself-similar regions. We solve the graph-cut problem using spectral clustering\nwith generalized eigen-decomposition and show that the second smallest\neigenvector provides a cutting solution since its absolute value indicates the\nlikelihood that a token belongs to a foreground object. Despite its simplicity,\nthis approach significantly boosts the performance of unsupervised object\ndiscovery: we improve over the recent state of the art LOST by a margin of\n6.9%, 8.1%, and 8.1% respectively on the VOC07, VOC12, and COCO20K. The\nperformance can be further improved by adding a second stage class-agnostic\ndetector (CAD). Our proposed method can be easily extended to unsupervised\nsaliency detection and weakly supervised object detection. For unsupervised\nsaliency detection, we improve IoU for 4.9%, 5.2%, 12.9% on ECSSD, DUTS,\nDUT-OMRON respectively compared to previous state of the art. For weakly\nsupervised object detection, we achieve competitive performance on CUB and\nImageNet.",

This ability of amodal perception forms the basis\nof our perceptual and cognitive understanding of our world. To enable robots to\nreason with this capability, we formulate and propose a novel task that we name\namodal panoptic segmentation. The goal of this task is to simultaneously\npredict the pixel-wise semantic segmentation labels of the visible regions of\nstuff classes and the instance segmentation labels of both the visible and\noccluded regions of thing classes. To facilitate research on this new task, we\nextend two established benchmark datasets with pixel-level amodal panoptic\nsegmentation labels that we make publicly available as KITTI-360-APS and\nBDD100K-APS. We present several strong baselines, along with the amodal\npanoptic quality (APQ) and amodal parsing coverage (APC) metrics to quantify\nthe performance in an interpretable manner. Furthermore, we propose the novel\namodal panoptic segmentation network (APSNet), as a first step towards\naddressing this task by explicitly modeling the complex relationships between\nthe occluders and occludes. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that\nAPSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on both benchmarks and more\nimportantly exemplifies the utility of amodal recognition.

    "abstract": "This paper is devoted to the construction and analysis of immersed finite\nelement (IFE) methods in three dimensions. Different from the 2D case, the\npoints of intersection of the interface and the edges of a tetrahedron are\nusually not coplanar, which makes the extension of the original 2D IFE methods\nbased on a piecewise linear approximation of the interface to the 3D case not\nstraightforward. We address this coplanarity issue by an approach where the\ninterface is approximated via discrete level set functions. This approach is\nvery convenient from a computational point of view since in many practical\napplications the exact interface is often unknown, and only a discrete level\nset function is available. As this approach has also not be considered in the\n2D IFE methods, in this paper we present a unified framework for both 2D and 3D\ncases. We consider an IFE method based on the traditional Crouzeix-Raviart\nelement using integral values on faces as degrees of freedom. The novelty of\nthe proposed IFE is the unisolvence of basis functions on arbitrary\ntriangles/tetrahedrons without any angle restrictions, which is advantageous\nover the IFE using nodal values as degrees of freedom. The optimal bounds for\nthe IFE interpolation errors are proved on shape-regular triangulations. For\nthe IFE method, optimal a priori error and condition number estimates are\nderived with constants independent of the location of the interface with\nrespect to the unfitted mesh. Numerical examples supporting the theoretical\nresults are provided.",

In a dynamic setting, the set of point features and their\ncorresponding labels changes, and the labeling has to adapt to such changes. To\naid the user in tracking these changes, we can use morphs, here called\ntransitions, to indicate how a labeling changes. Such transitions have not\ngained much attention yet, and we investigate different types of transitions\nfor labelings of points, most notably consecutive transitions and simultaneous\ntransitions. We give (tight) bounds on the number of overlaps that can occur\nduring these transitions. When each label has a (non-negative) weight\nassociated to it, and each overlap imposes a penalty proportional to the weight\nof the overlapping labels, we show that it is NP-complete to decide whether the\npenalty during a simultaneous transition has weight at most $k$.",

    "abstract": "Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to learn policies from previously\ncollected datasets without exploring the environment. Directly applying\noff-policy algorithms to offline RL usually fails due to the extrapolation\nerror caused by the out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. Previous methods tackle\nsuch problem by penalizing the Q-values of OOD actions or constraining the\ntrained policy to be close to the behavior policy. Nevertheless, such methods\ntypically prevent the generalization of value functions beyond the offline data\nand also lack precise characterization of OOD data. In this paper, we propose\nPessimistic Bootstrapping for offline RL (PBRL), a purely uncertainty-driven\noffline algorithm without explicit policy constraints. Specifically, PBRL\nconducts uncertainty quantification via the disagreement of bootstrapped\nQ-functions, and performs pessimistic updates by penalizing the value function\nbased on the estimated uncertainty. To tackle the extrapolating error, we\nfurther propose a novel OOD sampling method. We show that such OOD sampling and\npessimistic bootstrapping yields provable uncertainty quantifier in linear\nMDPs, thus providing the theoretical underpinning for PBRL. Extensive\nexperiments on D4RL benchmark show that PBRL has better performance compared to\nthe state-of-the-art algorithms.",

This result is robust under changing initial conditions, such as\ninitial patients' numbers and locations. Social distancing (spatial) pods\nperform well only at the initial phase of the disease, i.e., with a minimal\nnumber of initial patients. Using real-life contact information and extending\nour interaction-driven model to consider the exposures, we demonstrate the\nbeneficial effect of reducing the temporal density on overall infection rates.\nWe further show that slow-spreading pathogens spread almost as fast-spreading\npathogens in dense topologies. Our results show that given the same\ntransmission level, there is a decrease in the disease's rate and spread in\nless dense networks. Thus, reducing the rate of encounters is more effective\nthan social distancing.",

    "abstract": "We show that the sample complexity of robust interpolation problem could be\nexponential in the input dimensionality and discover a phase transition\nphenomenon when the data are in a unit ball. Robust interpolation refers to the\nproblem of interpolating $n$ noisy training data in $\\R^d$ by a Lipschitz\nfunction. Although this problem has been well understood when the covariates\nare drawn from an isoperimetry distribution, much remains unknown concerning\nits performance under generic or even the worst-case distributions. Our results\nare two-fold: 1) too many data hurt robustness; we provide a tight and\nuniversal Lipschitzness lower bound $\\Omega(n^{1/d})$ of the interpolating\nfunction for arbitrary data distributions. Our result disproves potential\nexistence of an $\\mathcal{O}(1)$-Lipschitz function in the overparametrization\nscenario when $n=\\exp(\\omega(d))$. 2) Small data hurt robustness:\n$n=\\exp(\\Omega(d))$ is necessary for obtaining a good population error under\ncertain distributions by any $\\mathcal{O}(1)$-Lipschitz learning algorithm.\nPerhaps surprisingly, our results shed light on the curse of big data and the\nblessing of dimensionality for robustness, and discover an intriguing\nphenomenon of phase transition at $n=\\exp(\\Theta(d))$.",

In this context, we\nstudy a multi-IRS assisted two-way communication system consisting of two users\nthat employ full-duplex (FD) technology. More specifically, we deal with the\njoint IRS location and size (i.e., the number of reflecting elements)\noptimization in order to minimize an upper bound of system outage probability\nunder various constraints, namely, minimum and maximum number of reflecting\nelements per IRS, maximum number of installed IRSs, maximum total number of\nreflecting elements (implicit bound on the signaling overhead) as well as\nmaximum total IRS installation cost. First, the problem is formulated as a\ndiscrete optimization problem and, then, a theoretical proof of its NP-hardness\nis given.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of fairly allocating items to a set of individuals,\nwhen the items are arriving online. A central solution concept in fair\nallocation is competitive equilibrium: every individual is endowed with a\nbudget of faux currency, and the resulting competitive equilibrium is used to\nallocate. For the online fair allocation context, the PACE algorithm of Gao et\nal. [2021] leverages the dual averaging algorithm to approximate competitive\nequilibria. The authors show that, when items arrive i.i.d, the algorithm\nasymptotically achieves the fairness and efficiency guarantees of the offline\ncompetitive equilibrium allocation. However, real-world data is typically not\nstationary. One could instead model the data as adversarial, but this is often\ntoo pessimistic in practice. Motivated by this consideration, we study an\nonline fair allocation setting with nonstationary item arrivals. To address\nthis setting, we first develop new online learning results for the dual\naveraging algorithm under nonstationary input models. We show that the dual\naveraging iterates converge in mean square to both the underlying optimal\nsolution of the ``true'' stochastic optimization problem as well as the\n``hindsight'' optimal solution of the finite-sum problem given by the sample\npath. Our results apply to several nonstationary input models: adversarial\ncorruption, ergodic input, and block-independent (including periodic) input.\nHere, the bound on the mean square error depends on a nonstationarity measure\nof the input. We recover the classical bound when the input data is i.i.d. We\nthen show that our dual averaging results imply that the PACE algorithm for\nonline fair allocation simultaneously achieves ``best of both worlds''\nguarantees against any of these input models. Finally, we conduct numerical\nexperiments which show strong empirical performance against nonstationary\ninputs.",

Cloud\nservice providers have therefore moved towards flexible systems that prioritize\nre-arrangeable hardware components that are not shared between users to\nminimize attack surfaces while retaining scalability. In this work, we show\nthat for the sake of system security it is necessary to consider not only the\nsecurity of the processors and peripherals of a system but also the security of\nthe subsystems that connect them. In particular, we investigate the\nside-channel leakage potential of the I/O translation look-aside buffer (IOTLB)\nused in I/O memory management units (IOMMUs) to cache address translations. To\nexploit the IOTLB, we design a hardware module deployed to an FPGA to help us\nperform precise timing measurements. For the first time, we prove that the\nIOTLB is the source of a timing-based side-channel leakage and use it to create\ntwo covert channels from CPU to peripheral and between peripherals. While the\nfirst channel easily achieves an error rate of only 30%, the latter proved to\nbe very reliable as nearly no errors occur. We present a close look at web\nfingerprints collected through this side-channel, and we examine the I/O\noperation of a GPU-accelerated SQL database. We then discuss several methods to\nremedy the observed side-channel leakages, including application design\ntechniques, peripheral layout within existing systems, and micro-architectural\nfeatures that could harden future IOMMUs.",

However, sharing the model parameters across the network\nmay still yield privacy breaches. In this paper, we present REX, the first\nenclave-based decentralized CF recommender. REX exploits Trusted execution\nenvironments (TEE), such as Intel software guard extensions (SGX), that provide\nshielded environments within the processor to improve convergence while\npreserving privacy. Firstly, REX enables raw data sharing, which ultimately\nspeeds up convergence and reduces the network load. Secondly, REX fully\npreserves privacy. We analyze the impact of raw data sharing in both deep\nneural network (DNN) and matrix factorization (MF) recommenders and showcase\nthe benefits of trusted environments in a full-fledged implementation of REX.\nOur experimental results demonstrate that through raw data sharing, REX\nsignificantly decreases the training time by 18.3x and the network load by 2\norders of magnitude over standard decentralized approaches that share only\nparameters, while fully protecting privacy by leveraging trustworthy hardware\nenclaves with very little overhead.",

    "abstract": "We present a new method for the unsupervised detection of geometric anomalies\nin high-resolution 3D point clouds. In particular, we propose an adaptation of\nthe established student-teacher anomaly detection framework to three\ndimensions. A student network is trained to match the output of a pretrained\nteacher network on anomaly-free point clouds. When applied to test data,\nregression errors between the teacher and the student allow reliable\nlocalization of anomalous structures. To construct an expressive teacher\nnetwork that extracts dense local geometric descriptors, we introduce a novel\nself-supervised pretraining strategy. The teacher is trained by reconstructing\nlocal receptive fields and does not require annotations. Extensive experiments\non the comprehensive MVTec 3D Anomaly Detection dataset highlight the\neffectiveness of our approach, which outperforms the next-best method by a\nlarge margin.

Using the graph structure of\noverlapping feather trees as an underlying network, we show how to reconfigure\na particle system in a linear number of activation rounds.

In this work, we show that mean-field variational\ninference entirely fails to model the data when the network width is large and\nthe activation function is odd.

We generalize aspects of this result to other likelihoods. Our\ntheoretical results are suggestive of underfitting behavior previously\nobservered in BNNs. While our convergence bounds are non-asymptotic and\nconstants in our analysis can be computed, they are currently too loose to be\napplicable in standard training regimes.

    "abstract": "Radio frequency-orbital angular momentum (RF-OAM) is a novel approach of\nmultiplexing a set of orthogonal modes on the same frequency channel to achieve\nhigh spectrum efficiencies. Since OAM requires precise alignment of the\ntransmit and the receive antennas, the electronic beam steering approach has\nbeen proposed for the uniform circular array (UCA)-based OAM communication\nsystem to circumvent large performance degradation induced by small antenna\nmisalignment in practical environment. However, in the case of large-angle\nmisalignment, the OAM channel capacity can not be effectively compensated only\nby the electronic beam steering. To solve this problem, we propose a hybrid\nmechanical and electronic beam steering scheme, in which mechanical rotating\ndevices controlled by pulse width modulation (PWM) signals as the execution\nunit are utilized to eliminate the large misalignment angle, while electronic\nbeam steering is in charge of the remaining small misalignment angle caused by\nperturbations. Furthermore, due to the interferometry, the receive\nsignal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) are not uniform at the elements of the receive\nUCA. Therefore, a rotatable UCA structure is proposed for the OAM receiver to\nmaximize the channel capacity, in which the simulated annealing algorithm is\nadopted to obtain the optimal rotation angle at first, then the servo system\nperforms mechanical rotation, at last the electronic beam steering is adjusted\naccordingly.

To overcome the\ncomputation constraints, the UAVs can partially or fully offload their\ncomputation tasks to the edge servers. In ordinary computation offloading\noperations, the UAVs can retrieve the result from the returned output.\nNevertheless, if the UAVs are unable to retrieve the entire result from the\nedge servers, i.e., straggling edge servers, this operation will fail. In this\npaper, we propose a coded distributed computing approach for computation\noffloading to mitigate straggling edge servers. The UAVs can retrieve the\nreturned result when the number of returned copies is greater than or equal to\nthe recovery threshold. There is a shortfall if the returned copies are less\nthan the recovery threshold. To minimize the cost of the network, energy\nconsumption by the UAVs, and prevent over and under subscription of the\nresources, we devise a two-phase Stochastic Coded Offloading Scheme (SCOS). In\nthe first phase, the appropriate UAVs are allocated to the charging stations\namid weather uncertainty. In the second phase, we use the $z$-stage Stochastic\nInteger Programming (SIP) to optimize the number of computation subtasks\noffloaded and computed locally, while taking into account the computation\nshortfall and demand uncertainty. By using a real dataset, the simulation\nresults show that our proposed scheme is fully dynamic, and minimizes the cost\nof the network and UAV energy consumption amid stochastic uncertainties.",

    "abstract": "In wireless networks, the rate achieved depends on factors like level of\ninterference, hardware impairments, and channel gain. Often, instantaneous\nvalues of some of these factors can be measured, and they provide useful\ninformation about the instantaneous rate achieved. For example, higher\ninterference implies a lower rate. In this work, we treat any such measurable\nquality that has a non-zero correlation with the rate achieved as\nside-information and study how it can be exploited to quickly learn the channel\nthat offers higher throughput (reward). When the mean value of the\nside-information is known, using control variate theory we develop algorithms\nthat require fewer samples to learn the parameters and can improve the learning\nrate compared to cases where side-information is ignored. Specifically, we\nincorporate side-information in the classical Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)\nalgorithm and quantify the gain achieved in the regret performance. We show\nthat the gain is proportional to the amount of the correlation between the\nreward and associated side-information. We discuss in detail various\nside-information that can be exploited in cognitive radio and air-to-ground\ncommunication in $L-$band. We demonstrate that correlation between the reward\nand side-information is often strong in practice and exploiting it improves the\nthroughput significantly.",

This study investigates the effect\nof treating vectors as geometrical objects in terms of super-resolution of\nvelocity on two-dimensional fluids. Vector is distinguished from scalar by the\ntransformation law associated with a change in basis, which can be incorporated\nas the prior knowledge using the equivariant deep learning. We convert existing\nCNNs into equivariant ones by making each layer equivariant with respect to\nrotation and translation. The training data in the low- and high-resolution are\ngenerated with the downsampling or the spectral nudging. When the data inherit\nthe rotational symmetry, the equivariant CNNs show comparable accuracy with the\nnon-equivariant ones. Since the number of parameters is smaller in the\nequivariant CNNs, these models are trainable with a smaller size of the data.\nIn this case, the transformation law of vector should be incorporated as the\nprior knowledge, where vector is explicitly treated as a quantity having\ndirection. Two examples demonstrate that the symmetry of the data can be\nbroken. In the first case, a downsampling method makes the correspondence\nbetween low- and high-resolution patterns dependent on the orientation. In the\nsecond case, the input data are insufficient to recognize the rotation of\ncoordinates in the experiment with the spectral nudging. In both cases, the\naccuracy of the CNNs deteriorates if the equivariance is forced to be imposed,\nand the usage of conventional CNNs may be justified even though vector is\nprocessed as a quantity having no direction.",

    "abstract": "Many supervised machine learning frameworks have been proposed for disease\nclassification using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data,\nproducing important biomarkers. More recently, data pooling has flourished,\nmaking the result generalizable across a large population. But, this success\ndepends on the population diversity and variability introduced due to the\npooling of the data that is not a primary research interest. Here, we look at\nhierarchical Sparse Connectivity Patterns (hSCPs) as biomarkers for major\ndepressive disorder (MDD). We propose a novel model based on hSCPs to predict\nMDD patients from functional connectivity matrices extracted from resting-state\nfMRI data. Our model consists of three coupled terms. The first term decomposes\nconnectivity matrices into hierarchical low-rank sparse components\ncorresponding to synchronous patterns across the human brain. These components\nare then combined via patient-specific weights capturing heterogeneity in the\ndata. The second term is a classification loss that uses the patient-specific\nweights to classify MDD patients from healthy ones. Both of these terms are\ncombined with the third term, a robustness loss function to improve the\nreproducibility of hSCPs. This reduces the variability introduced due to site\nand population diversity (age and sex) on the predictive accuracy and pattern\nstability in a large dataset pooled from five different sites. Our results show\nthe impact of diversity on prediction performance. Our model can reduce\ndiversity and improve the predictive and generalizing capability of the\ncomponents. Finally, our results show that our proposed model can robustly\nidentify clinically relevant patterns characteristic of MDD with high\nreproducibility.",

We can show that equivalent QML and CML models\nare complementary through diversity measurements. The diversity between QML and\nCML demonstrates that both approaches can contribute to a solution in different\nways. Within this paper we focus on Quantum Support Vector Classifiers (QSVC),\nVariational Quantum Circuit (VQC), and their classical counterparts.

    "abstract": "Purpose: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data acquired through\nresting-state studies have been used to obtain information about the\nspontaneous activations inside the brain. One of the approaches for analysis\nand interpretation of resting-state fMRI data require spatially and\nfunctionally homogenous parcellation of the whole brain based on underlying\ntemporal fluctuations. Clustering is often used to generate functional\nparcellation. However, major clustering algorithms, when used for fMRI data,\nhave their limitations. Among commonly used parcellation schemes, a tradeoff\nexists between intra-cluster functional similarity and alignment with\nanatomical regions. Approach: In this work, we present a clustering algorithm\nfor resting state and task fMRI data which is developed to obtain brain\nparcellations that show high structural and functional homogeneity. The\nclustering is performed by multistage binary k-means clustering algorithm\ndesigned specifically for the 4D fMRI data. The results from this multistage\nk-means algorithm show that by modifying and combining different algorithms, we\ncan take advantage of the strengths of different techniques while overcoming\ntheir limitations. Results: The clustering output for resting state fMRI data\nusing the multistage k-means approach is shown to be better than simple k-means\nor functional atlas in terms of spatial and functional homogeneity. The\nclusters also correspond to commonly identifiable brain networks. For task\nfMRI, the clustering output can identify primary and secondary activation\nregions and provide information about the varying hemodynamic response across\ndifferent brain regions. Conclusion: The multistage k-means approach can\nprovide functional parcellations of the brain using resting state fMRI data.\nThe method is model-free and is data driven which can be applied to both\nresting state and task fMRI.",

That\nmakes the design of LPCNet-based systems more complicated, while adding the\nconstraint that the input features must represent a clean speech spectrum.

Results show that the proposed end-to-end approach can reach the same\nlevel of quality as the original LPCNet model, but without explicit LP\nanalysis.

During the training\nprocess, these networks are typically optimized to differentiate arbitrary\nspeakers. This learning process biases the learning of fine voice\ncharacteristics towards dominant demographic groups, which can lead to an\nunfair performance disparity across different groups. This is observed\nespecially with underrepresented demographic groups sharing similar voice\ncharacteristics. In this work, we investigate the fairness of speaker\nverification models on controlled datasets with imbalanced gender\ndistributions, providing direct evidence that model performance suffers for\nunderrepresented groups. To mitigate this disparity we propose the\ngroup-adapted fusion network (GFN) architecture, a modular architecture based\non group embedding adaptation and score fusion. We show that our method\nalleviates model unfairness by improving speaker verification both overall and\nfor individual groups. Given imbalanced group representation in training, our\nproposed method achieves overall equal error rate (EER) reduction of 9.6% to\n29.0% relative, reduces minority group EER by 13.7% to 18.6%, and results in\n20.0% to 25.4% less EER disparity, compared to baselines.

    "title": "Weakly-supervised learning for image-based classification of primary  melanomas into genomic immune subgroups",
    "abstract": "Determining early-stage prognostic markers and stratifying patients for\neffective treatment are two key challenges for improving outcomes for melanoma\npatients. Previous studies have used tumour transcriptome data to stratify\npatients into immune subgroups, which were associated with differential\nmelanoma specific survival and potential treatment strategies. However,\nacquiring transcriptome data is a time-consuming and costly process. Moreover,\nit is not routinely used in the current clinical workflow. Here we attempt to\novercome this by developing deep learning models to classify gigapixel H&E\nstained pathology slides, which are well established in clinical workflows,\ninto these immune subgroups. Previous subtyping approaches have employed\nsupervised learning which requires fully annotated data, or have only examined\nsingle genetic mutations in melanoma patients. We leverage a multiple-instance\nlearning approach, which only requires slide-level labels and uses an attention\nmechanism to highlight regions of high importance to the classification.\nMoreover, we show that pathology-specific self-supervised models generate\nbetter representations compared to pathology-agnostic models for improving our\nmodel performance, achieving a mean AUC of 0.76 for classifying histopathology\nimages as high or low immune subgroups. We anticipate that this method may\nallow us to find new biomarkers of high importance and could act as a tool for\nclinicians to infer the immune landscape of tumours and stratify patients,\nwithout needing to carry out additional expensive genetic tests.",

The diversity of\napproaches, perspectives, and solutions related to pdf fusion motivates a\nunified presentation of the theory and methodology of the field.

In the\noptimization approach, it is the result of minimizing an objective function\nthat involves an information-theoretic divergence or a distance measure. In the\nsupra-Bayesian approach, the fusion center interprets the pdfs to be fused as\nrandom observations. Our work is partly a survey, reviewing in a structured and\ncoherent fashion many of the concepts and methods that have been developed in\nthe literature. In addition, we present new results for each of the three\napproaches.

    "abstract": "Statistical model updating is frequently used in engineering to calculate the\nuncertainty of some unknown latent parameters when a set of measurements on\nobservable quantities is given. Variational inference is an alternative\napproach to sampling methods that has been developed by the machine learning\ncommunity to estimate posterior approximations through an optimization\napproach. In this paper, the Variational Bayesian Monte Carlo (VBMC) method is\ninvestigated with the purpose of dealing with statistical model updating\nproblems in engineering involving expensive-to-run models. This method combines\nthe active-sampling Bayesian quadrature with a Gaussian-process based\nvariational inference to yield a non-parametric estimation of the posterior\ndistribution of the identified parameters involving few runs of the\nexpensive-to-run model. VBMC can also be used for model selection as it\nproduces an estimation of the model's evidence lower bound. In this paper, a\nvariant of the VBMC algorithm is developed through the introduction of a\ncyclical annealing schedule into the algorithm. The proposed cyclical VBMC\nalgorithm allows to deal effectively with multi-modal posteriors by having\nmultiple cycles of exploration and exploitation phases. Four numerical examples\nare used to compare the standard VBMC algorithm, the monotonic VBMC, the\ncyclical VBMC and the Transitional Ensemble Markov Chain Monte Carlo (TEMCMC).\nOverall, it is found that the proposed cyclical VBMC approach yields accurate\nresults with a very reduced number of model runs compared to the state of the\nart sampling technique TEMCMC.

    "title": "Bounding quantum capacities via partial orders and complementarity",
    "abstract": "Quantum capacities are fundamental quantities that are notoriously hard to\ncompute and can exhibit surprising properties such as superadditivity. Thus, a\nvast amount of literature is devoted to finding tight and computable bounds on\nthese capacities. We add a new viewpoint by giving operationally motivated\nbounds on several capacities, including the quantum capacity and private\ncapacity of a quantum channel and the one-way distillable entanglement and\nprivate key of a quantum state. These bounds are generally phrased in terms of\ncapacity quantities involving the complementary channel or state. As a tool to\nobtain these bounds, we discuss partial orders on quantum channels and states,\nsuch as the less noisy and the more capable order. Our bounds help to further\nunderstand the interplay between different capacities, as they give operational\nlimitations on superadditivity and the difference between capacities in terms\nof the information-theoretic properties of the complementary channel or state.\nThey can also be used as a new approach towards numerically bounding\ncapacities, as discussed with some examples.",

    "title": "Brain Structural Saliency Over The Ages",
    "abstract": "Brain Age (BA) estimation via Deep Learning has become a strong and reliable\nbio-marker for brain health, but the black-box nature of Neural Networks does\nnot easily allow insight into the causal features of brain ageing. We trained a\nResNet model as a BA regressor on T1 structural MRI volumes from a small\ncross-sectional cohort of 524 individuals. Using Layer-wise Relevance\nPropagation (LRP) and DeepLIFT saliency mapping techniques, we analysed the\ntrained model to determine the most revealing structures over the course of\nbrain ageing for the network, and compare these between the saliency mapping\ntechniques. We show the change in attribution of relevance to different brain\nregions through the course of ageing. A tripartite pattern of relevance\nattribution to brain regions emerges. Some regions increase in relevance with\nage (e.g. the right Transverse Temporal Gyrus, known to be affected by healthy\nageing); some decrease in relevance with age (e.g. the right Fourth Ventricle,\nknown to dilate with age); and others remained consistently relevant across\nages. We also examine the effect of Brain Age Delta (DBA) on the distribution\nof relevance within the brain volume. It is hoped that these findings will\nprovide clinically relevant region-wise trajectories for normal brain ageing,\nand a baseline against which to compare brain ageing trajectories.",

    "title": "Super-resolution GANs of randomly-seeded fields",
    "abstract": "Reconstruction of field quantities from sparse measurements is a problem\narising in a broad spectrum of applications. This task is particularly\nchallenging when mapping between point sparse measurements and field quantities\nshall be performed in an unsupervised manner. Further complexity is added for\nmoving sensors and/or random on-off status. Under such conditions, the most\nstraightforward solution is to interpolate the scattered data onto a regular\ngrid. However, the spatial resolution achieved with this approach is ultimately\nlimited by the mean spacing between the sparse measurements. In this work, we\npropose a novel super-resolution generative adversarial network (GAN) framework\nto estimate field quantities from random sparse sensors without needing any\nfull-resolution field for training. The algorithm exploits random sampling to\nprovide incomplete views of the high-resolution underlying distributions. It is\nhereby referred to as RAndomly-SEEDed super-resolution GAN (RaSeedGAN). The\nproposed technique is tested on synthetic databases of fluid flow simulations,\nocean surface temperature distributions measurements, and particle image\nvelocimetry data of a zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer. The\nresults show an excellent performance of the proposed methodology even in cases\nwith a high level of gappyness (>50\\%) or noise conditions. To our knowledge,\nthis is the first super-resolution GANs algorithm for full-field estimation\nfrom randomly-seeded fields with no need of a full-field high-resolution\nrepresentation during training nor of a library of training examples.",
