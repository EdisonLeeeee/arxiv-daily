    "title": "Retriever: Learning Content-Style Representation as a Token-Level  Bipartite Graph",
    "abstract": "This paper addresses the unsupervised learning of content-style decomposed\nrepresentation. We first give a definition of style and then model the\ncontent-style representation as a token-level bipartite graph. An unsupervised\nframework, named Retriever, is proposed to learn such representations. First, a\ncross-attention module is employed to retrieve permutation invariant (P.I.)\ninformation, defined as style, from the input data. Second, a vector\nquantization (VQ) module is used, together with man-induced constraints, to\nproduce interpretable content tokens. Last, an innovative link attention module\nserves as the decoder to reconstruct data from the decomposed content and\nstyle, with the help of the linking keys. Being modal-agnostic, the proposed\nRetriever is evaluated in both speech and image domains. The state-of-the-art\nzero-shot voice conversion performance confirms the disentangling ability of\nour framework. Top performance is also achieved in the part discovery task for\nimages, verifying the interpretability of our representation. In addition, the\nvivid part-based style transfer quality demonstrates the potential of Retriever\nto support various fascinating generative tasks.

    "abstract": "On the path to exascale the landscape of computer device architectures and\ncorresponding programming models has become much more diverse. While various\nlow-level performance portable programming models are available, support at the\napplication level lacks behind. To address this issue, we present the\nperformance portable block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) framework\nParthenon, derived from the well-tested and widely used Athena++ astrophysical\nmagnetohydrodynamics code, but generalized to serve as the foundation for a\nvariety of downstream multi-physics codes. Parthenon adopts the Kokkos\nprogramming model, and provides various levels of abstractions from\nmulti-dimensional variables, to packages defining and separating components, to\nlaunching of parallel compute kernels. Parthenon allocates all data in device\nmemory to reduce data movement, supports the logical packing of variables and\nmesh blocks to reduce kernel launch overhead, and employs one-sided,\nasynchronous MPI calls to reduce communication overhead in multi-node\nsimulations. Using a hydrodynamics miniapp, we demonstrate weak and strong\nscaling on various architectures including AMD and NVIDIA GPUs, Intel and AMD\nx86 CPUs, as well as Fujitsu A64FX CPUs. At the largest scale, the miniapp\nreaches a total of 3.5x10^12 zone-cycles/s on 4096 Summit nodes (24576 GPUs) at\n~55% weak scaling parallel efficiency (starting from a single node). In\ncombination with being an open, collaborative project, this makes Parthenon an\nideal framework to target exascale simulations in which the downstream\ndevelopers can focus on their specific application rather than on the\ncomplexity of handling massively-parallel, device-accelerated AMR.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about what makes cross-lingual transfer hard, since factors\nlike tokenization, morphology, and syntax all change at once between languages.\nTo disentangle the impact of these factors, we propose a set of controlled\ntransfer studies: we systematically transform GLUE tasks to alter different\nfactors one at a time, then measure the resulting drops in a pretrained model's\ndownstream performance. In contrast to prior work suggesting little effect from\nsyntax on knowledge transfer, we find significant impacts from syntactic shifts\n(3-6% drop), though models quickly adapt with continued pretraining on a small\ndataset. However, we find that by far the most impactful factor for\ncrosslingual transfer is the challenge of aligning the new embeddings with the\nexisting transformer layers (18% drop), with little additional effect from\nswitching tokenizers (<2% drop) or word morphologies (<2% drop). Moreover,\ncontinued pretraining with a small dataset is not very effective at closing\nthis gap - suggesting that new directions are needed for solving this problem.",

We use the\nwhitening trick to evade the strong dependency between the sampled function\nvalues and kernel parameters, and develop a stochastic variational learning\nalgorithm. Our method shows improvement upon vanilla GPs in both simulation and\nseveral real-world applications, even using rough, incomplete equations.",

Physics is particularly successful in this,\ndue to its ability to describe complex dynamical systems. While explanations of\nphenomena in machine learning based on physics are increasingly present,\nexamples of direct application of notions akin to physics in order to improve\nmachine learning systems are more scarce. Here we provide one such application\nin the problem of developing algorithms that preserve the privacy of the\nmanipulated data, which is especially important in tasks such as the processing\nof medical records. We develop well-defined conditions to guarantee robustness\nto specific types of privacy leaks, and rigorously prove that such conditions\nare satisfied by tensor-network architectures. These are inspired by the\nefficient representation of quantum many-body systems, and have shown to\ncompete and even surpass traditional machine learning architectures in certain\ncases.

Such allocations pervade social service\ndelivery, such as provision of homeless services, assignment of refugees to\ncities, among others. At issue is whether allocations are fair across\nsociodemographic groups and intersectional identities. Our paper shows that\nnecessary trade-offs exist for fairness in the context of scarcity; many\nreasonable definitions of equitable outcomes cannot hold simultaneously except\nunder stringent conditions. For example, defining fairness in terms of\nimprovement over a baseline inherently conflicts with defining fairness in\nterms of loss compared with the best possible outcome. Moreover, we demonstrate\nthat the fairness trade-offs stem from heterogeneity across groups in\nintervention responses. Administrative records on homeless service delivery\noffer a real-world example. Building on prior work, we measure utilities for\neach household as the probability of reentry into homeless services if given\nthree homeless services. Heterogeneity in utility distributions (conditional on\nreceived services) for several sociodemographic groups (e.g. single women with\nchildren versus without children) generates divergence across fairness metrics.\nWe argue that such heterogeneity, and thus, fairness trade-offs pervade many\nsocial policy contexts.",

However, manually patching binaries is time-consuming, requires\nsignificant expertise, and does not scale to the rate at which new\nvulnerabilities are discovered. To address these problems, we introduce\nPartially Recompilable Decompilation (PRD), which extracts and decompiles\nsuspect binary functions to source where they can be patched or analyzed,\napplies transformations to enable recompilation of these functions (partial\nrecompilation), then employs binary rewriting techniques to create a patched\nbinary. Although decompilation and recompilation do not universally apply,\nPRD's fault localization identifies a function subset that is small enough to\nadmit decompilation and large enough to address many vulnerabilities. Our\napproach succeeds because decompilation is limited to a few functions and\nlifting facilitates analysis and repair.\nTo demonstrate the scalability of PRD, we evaluate it in the context of a\nfully automated end-to-end scenario that relies on source-level Automated\nProgram Repair (APR) methods to mitigate the vulnerabilities. We also evaluate\nPRD in the context of human-generated source-level repairs. In the end-to-end\nexperiment, PRD produced test-equivalent binaries in 84% of cases; and the\npatched binaries incur no significant run-time overhead. When combined with APR\ntools and evaluated on the DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC) benchmarks, PRD\nachieved similar success rates as the winning CGC entries, while presenting\nrepairs as source-level patches which can be reviewed by humans; In some cases,\nPRD finds higher-quality mitigations than those produced by top CGC teams.

    "abstract": "The adaptive processing of structured data is a long-standing research topic\nin machine learning that investigates how to automatically learn a mapping from\na structured input to outputs of various nature. Recently, there has been an\nincreasing interest in the adaptive processing of graphs, which led to the\ndevelopment of different neural network-based methodologies. In this thesis, we\ntake a different route and develop a Bayesian Deep Learning framework for graph\nlearning. The dissertation begins with a review of the principles over which\nmost of the methods in the field are built, followed by a study on graph\nclassification reproducibility issues. We then proceed to bridge the basic\nideas of deep learning for graphs with the Bayesian world, by building our deep\narchitectures in an incremental fashion. This framework allows us to consider\ngraphs with discrete and continuous edge features, producing unsupervised\nembeddings rich enough to reach the state of the art on several classification\ntasks. Our approach is also amenable to a Bayesian nonparametric extension that\nautomatizes the choice of almost all model's hyper-parameters. Two real-world\napplications demonstrate the efficacy of deep learning for graphs. The first\nconcerns the prediction of information-theoretic quantities for molecular\nsimulations with supervised neural models. After that, we exploit our Bayesian\nmodels to solve a malware-classification task while being robust to\nintra-procedural code obfuscation techniques. We conclude the dissertation with\nan attempt to blend the best of the neural and Bayesian worlds together. The\nresulting hybrid model is able to predict multimodal distributions conditioned\non input graphs, with the consequent ability to model stochasticity and\nuncertainty better than most works. Overall, we aim to provide a Bayesian\nperspective into the articulated research field of deep learning for graphs.",

Economic losses are getting greater due to the hurricanes.\nQuick and prompt response of the rescue teams are crucial in saving human lives\nand reducing economic cost. Deep learning based computer vision techniques can\nhelp in scene understanding, and help rescue teams with precise damage\nassessment. Semantic segmentation, an active research area in computer vision,\ncan put labels to each pixel of an image, and therefore can be a valuable\narsenal in the effort of reducing the impacts of hurricanes. Unfortunately,\navailable datasets for natural disaster damage assessment lack detailed\nannotation of the affected areas, and therefore do not support the deep\nlearning models in total damage assessment. To this end, we introduce the\nRescueNet, a high resolution post disaster dataset, for semantic segmentation\nto assess damages after natural disasters. The RescueNet consists of post\ndisaster images collected after Hurricane Michael. The data is collected using\nUnmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) from several areas impacted by the hurricane.\nThe uniqueness of the RescueNet comes from the fact that this dataset provides\nhigh resolution post-disaster images and comprehensive annotation of each\nimage. While most of the existing dataset offer annotation of only part of the\nscene, like building, road, or river, RescueNet provides pixel level annotation\nof all the classes including building, road, pool, tree, debris, and so on. We\nfurther analyze the usefulness of the dataset by implementing state-of-the-art\nsegmentation models on the RescueNet. The experiments demonstrate that our\ndataset can be valuable in further improvement of the existing methodologies\nfor natural disaster damage assessment.",

    "abstract": "Generating images that fit a given text description using machine learning\nhas improved greatly with the release of technologies such as the CLIP\nimage-text encoder model; however, current methods lack artistic control of the\nstyle of image to be generated. We present an approach for generating styled\ndrawings for a given text description where a user can specify a desired\ndrawing style using a sample image. Inspired by a theory in art that style and\ncontent are generally inseparable during the creative process, we propose a\ncoupled approach, known here as StyleCLIPDraw, whereby the drawing is generated\nby optimizing for style and content simultaneously throughout the process as\nopposed to applying style transfer after creating content in a sequence. Based\non human evaluation, the styles of images generated by StyleCLIPDraw are\nstrongly preferred to those by the sequential approach. Although the quality of\ncontent generation degrades for certain styles, overall considering both\ncontent \\textit{and} style, StyleCLIPDraw is found far more preferred,\nindicating the importance of style, look, and feel of machine generated images\nto people as well as indicating that style is coupled in the drawing process\nitself.

Binary neural networks (BNN) have been recently\nproposed to address VPR efficiently.

    "abstract": "A four-field mixed variational principle is proposed for large deformation\nanalysis of Kirchhoff rods with a $C^0$ mixed FE approximations. The core idea\nbehind the approach is to introduce a one-parameter family of points (the\ncenterline) and a separate one-parameter family of orthonormal frames (the\nCartan moving frame) that are specified independently. The curvature and\ntorsion of the curve are related to the relative rotation of neighboring\nframes. The relationship between the frame and the centerline is then enforced\nat the solution step using a Lagrange multiplier (which plays the role of\nsection force). Well known frames like the Frenet-Serret are defined only using\nthe centerline, which demands higher-order smoothness for the centerline\napproximation. Decoupling the frame from the position vector of the base curve\nleads to a description of torsion and curvature that is independent of the\nposition information, thus allowing for simpler interpolations. This approach\nis then cast in the language of exterior calculus. In this framework, the\nstrain energy may be interpreted as a differential form leading to the natural\nforce-displacement (velocity) pairing. The four-field mixed variational\nprinciple we propose has frame, differential forms, and position vector as\ninput arguments. While the position vector is interpolated linearly, the frames\nare interpolated as piecewise geodesics on the rotation group. Similarly,\nconsistent interpolation schemes are also adopted to obtain finite dimensional\napproximations for other differential forms aswell. Using these discrete\napproximations, a discrete mixed variational principle is laid out which is\nthen numerically extremized. The discrete approximation is then applied to\nbenchmark problems, our numerical studies reveal an impressive performance of\nthe proposed method without numerical instabilities or locking.",

    "abstract": "Locomotion requires that an animal or robot be able to move itself forward\nfarther than it moves backward in each gait cycle (formally, that it be able to\nbreak the symmetry of its interactions with the world). Previous work has\nestablished that a difference between lateral and longitudinal drag provides\nsufficient conditions for locomotion to be possible. The geometric mechanics\ncommunity has used this principle to build a geometric framework for describing\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of undulatory locomotion. Researchers in\nbiology and robotics have observed that structures such as snake scales\nadditionally provide a difference between forward and backward longitudinal\ndrag. As yet, however, the impact of scales on the geometric features relevant\nto locomotion effectiveness and efficiency have not yet been explored. We\npresent a geometric model for a single-joint undulating system with scales and\nidentify the features needed to understand its motion. Mathematically, the\nscales can be treated as inducing a \"Finsler metric\" on the configuration\nspace, and this paper lays the groundwork for further research into application\nof such Finsler metrics to robotic locomotion.",

Legged robot performance would\nalso likely benefit from the co-optimization of actuators and leg morphology.\nHowever, development of custom actuators for legged robots is often expensive\nand time consuming, which discourages roboticists from pursuing performance\ngains afforded by application-specific actuator optimization. This paper\npresents open-source designs for two quasi-direct-drive actuators with\nperformance regimes appropriate for an 8--15 kg robot, built completely with\noff the shelf and 3D-printed components for less than $200 USD each. The\nmechanical, electrical, and thermal properties of each actuator are\ncharacterized and compared to benchmark data. Actuators subjected to 420k\nstrides of gait data experienced only a 2% reduction in efficiency and 26 mrad\nin backlash growth, demonstrating viability for rigorous and sustained research\napplications. We present a thermal solution that nearly doubles the\nthermally-driven torque limits of our plastic actuator design. The performance\nresults are comparable to traditional metallic actuators for use in high-speed\nlegged robots of the same scale.

This\nis because adapting to new domains requires human intensive fact-checking that\nis slow and difficult to scale. To address this challenge, we propose to\nleverage news-source credibility labels as weak labels for social media posts\nand propose model-guided refinement of labels to construct large-scale, diverse\nmisinformation labeled datasets in new domains. The weak labels can be\ninaccurate at the article or social media post level where the stance of the\nuser does not align with the news source or article credibility.

The framework will incorporate social context of the post in terms\nof the community of its associated user for surfacing inaccurate labels towards\nbuilding a large-scale dataset with minimum human effort. To provide labeled\ndatasets with distinction of misleading narratives where information might be\nmissing significant context or has inaccurate ancillary details, the proposed\nframework will use the few labeled samples as class prototypes to separate high\nconfidence samples into false, unproven, mixture, mostly false, mostly true,\ntrue, and debunk information.

These can be\nmechanical, electrical, physiological, among others. Since most of the systems\naround us exhibit some form of nonlinear behavior, nonlinear system\nidentification techniques are the tools that will help us gain a better\nunderstanding of our surroundings and potentially let us improve their\nperformance. One model that is often used to represent nonlinear systems is the\npolynomial NARX model, an equation error model where the output is a polynomial\nfunction of the past inputs and outputs. That said, a major disadvantage with\nthe polynomial NARX model is that the number of parameters increases rapidly\nwith increasing polynomial order. Furthermore, the polynomial NARX model is a\nblack-box model, and is therefore difficult to interpret. This paper discusses\na decoupling algorithm for the polynomial NARX model that substitutes the\nmultivariate polynomial with a transformation matrix followed by a bank of\nunivariate polynomials. This decreases the number of model parameters\nsignificantly and also imposes structure on the black-box NARX model. Since a\nnon-convex optimization is required for this identification technique,\ninitialization is an important factor to consider. In this paper the decoupling\nalgorithm is developed in conjunction with several different initialization\ntechniques. The resulting algorithms are applied to two nonlinear benchmark\nproblems: measurement data from the Silver-Box and simulation data from the\nBouc-Wen friction model, and the performance is evaluated for different\nvalidation signals in both simulation and prediction.",

    "title": "Analyzing Human Observer Ability in Morphing Attack Detection -- Where  Do We Stand?",
    "abstract": "While several works have studied the vulnerability of automated FRS and have\nproposed morphing attack detection (MAD) methods, very few have focused on\nstudying the human ability to detect morphing attacks. The examiner/observer's\nface morph detection ability is based on their observation, domain knowledge,\nexperience, and familiarity with the problem, and no works report the detailed\nfindings from observers who check identity documents as a part of their\neveryday professional life. This work creates a new benchmark database of\nrealistic morphing attacks from 48 unique subjects leading to 400 morphed\nimages presented to the observers in a Differential-MAD (D-MAD) setting. Unlike\nthe existing databases, the newly created morphed image database has been\ncreated with careful considerations to age, gender and ethnicity to create\nrealistic morph attacks. Further, unlike the previous works, we also capture\nten images from Automated Border Control (ABC) gates to mimic the realistic\nD-MAD setting leading to 400 probe images in border crossing scenarios. The\nnewly created dataset is further used to study the ability of human observers'\nability to detect morphed images. In addition, a new dataset of 180 morphed\nimages is also created using the FRGCv2 dataset under the Single Image-MAD\n(S-MAD) setting. Further, to benchmark the human ability in detecting morphs, a\nnew evaluation platform is created to conduct S-MAD and D-MAD analysis. The\nbenchmark study employs 469 observers for D-MAD and 410 observers for S-MAD who\nare primarily governmental employees from more than 40 countries. The analysis\nprovides interesting insights and points to expert observers' missing\ncompetence and failure to detect a considerable amount of morphing attacks.\nHuman observers tend to detect morphed images to a lower accuracy as compared\nto the automated MAD algorithms evaluated in this work.",

In this work, we\nfocus on improving the temporal consistency without introducing computation\noverhead in inference. To this end, we perform inference at each frame.\nTemporal consistency is achieved by learning from video frames with extra\nconstraints during the training phase. introduced for inference. We propose\nseveral techniques to learn from the video sequence, including a temporal\nconsistency loss and online/offline knowledge distillation methods.

    "abstract": "Deep learning based recommendation models (DLRM) are widely used in several\nbusiness critical applications. Training such recommendation models efficiently\nis challenging primarily because they consist of billions of embedding-based\nparameters which are often stored remotely leading to significant overheads\nfrom embedding access. By profiling existing DLRM training, we observe that\nonly 8.5% of the iteration time is spent in forward/backward pass while the\nremaining time is spent on embedding and model synchronization. Our key insight\nin this paper is that access to embeddings have a specific structure and\npattern which can be used to accelerate training. We observe that embedding\naccesses are heavily skewed, with almost 1% of embeddings represent more than\n92% of total accesses. Further, we observe that during training we can\nlookahead at future batches to determine exactly which embeddings will be\nneeded at what iteration in the future. Based on these insight, we propose\nBagpipe, a system for training deep recommendation models that uses caching and\nprefetching to overlap remote embedding accesses with the computation. We\ndesigned an Oracle Cacher, a new system component which uses our lookahead\nalgorithm to generate optimal cache update decisions and provide strong\nconsistency guarantees. Our experiments using three datasets and two models\nshows that our approach provides a speed up of up to 6.2x compared to state of\nthe art baselines, while providing the same convergence and reproducibility\nguarantees as synchronous training.",

Koopman operator theory and\nHankel alternative view of Koopman (HAVOK) model have been widely used to\ndecompose the chaos of the complex system dynamics into an intermittent forced\nlinear system.

To validate our\nmethods, the intermittency behavior of apneic events in obstructive sleep apnea\ndisorder was selected as the case, in which heart rate variability (HRV)\nfeatures were extracted. Next, we constructed the Hankel matrix from the HRV\nfeatures and obtained the last eigen time-delay coordinate by singular value\ndecomposition of the Hankel matrix, which was modeled as an intermittent\nforcing input. The statistics of the forcing in OSA demonstrated the fat-tailed\ndistribution of the intermittent forcing, which correspond to the intermittency\nof the underlying OSA pathophysiological process.

In the list locally surjective homomorphism\nproblem, denoted by LLSHom($H$), the graph $H$ is fixed and the instance\nconsists of a graph $G$ whose every vertex is equipped with a subset of $V(H)$,\ncalled list. We ask for the existence of a locally surjective homomorphism from\n$G$ to $H$, where every vertex of $G$ is mapped to a vertex from its list. In\nthis paper, we study the complexity of the LLSHom($H$) problem in $F$-free\ngraphs, i.e., graphs that exclude a fixed graph $F$ as an induced subgraph. We\naim to understand for which pairs $(H,F)$ the problem can be solved in\nsubexponential time.\nWe show that for all graphs $H$, for which the problem is NP-hard in general\ngraphs, it cannot be solved in subexponential time in $F$-free graphs unless\n$F$ is a bounded-degree forest or the ETH fails.

It has become a global major public health problem\nand attracts attention from various research fields. Traditionally, the\ndiagnosis of depression is formulated through semi-structured interviews and\nsupplementary questionnaires, which makes the diagnosis heavily relying on\nphysicians experience and is subject to bias. Mental health monitoring and\ncloud-based remote diagnosis can be implemented through an automated depression\ndiagnosis system. In this article, we propose an attention-based multimodality\nspeech and text representation for depression prediction. Our model is trained\nto estimate the depression severity of participants using the Distress Analysis\nInterview Corpus-Wizard of Oz (DAIC-WOZ) dataset. For the audio modality, we\nuse the collaborative voice analysis repository (COVAREP) features provided by\nthe dataset and employ a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Network (Bi-LSTM)\nfollowed by a Time-distributed Convolutional Neural Network (T-CNN). For the\ntext modality, we use global vectors for word representation (GloVe) to perform\nword embeddings and the embeddings are fed into the Bi-LSTM network. Results\nshow that both audio and text models perform well on the depression severity\nestimation task, with best sequence level F1 score of 0.9870 and patient-level\nF1 score of 0.9074 for the audio model over five classes (healthy, mild,\nmoderate, moderately severe, and severe), as well as sequence level F1 score of\n0.9709 and patient-level F1 score of 0.9245 for the text model over five\nclasses.

    "abstract": "We present an end-to-end differentiable neural network architecture to\nperform anomaly detection in multivariate time series by incorporating a\nSequential Probability Ratio Test on the prediction residual. The architecture\nis a cascade of dynamical systems designed to separate linearly predictable\ncomponents of the signal such as trends and seasonality, from the non-linear\nones. The former are modeled by local Linear Dynamic Layers, and their residual\nis fed to a generic Temporal Convolutional Network that also aggregates global\nstatistics from different time series as context for the local predictions of\neach one. The last layer implements the anomaly detector, which exploits the\ntemporal structure of the prediction residuals to detect both isolated point\nanomalies and set-point changes. It is based on a novel application of the\nclassic CUMSUM algorithm, adapted through the use of a variational\napproximation of f-divergences. The model automatically adapts to the time\nscales of the observed signals. It approximates a SARIMA model at the get-go,\nand auto-tunes to the statistics of the signal and its covariates, without the\nneed for supervision, as more data is observed. The resulting system, which we\ncall STRIC, outperforms both state-of-the-art robust statistical methods and\ndeep neural network architectures on multiple anomaly detection benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Learning representations from electrocardiogram (ECG) serves as a fundamental\nstep for many downstream machine learning-based ECG analysis tasks. However,\nthe learning process is always restricted by lack of high-quality labeled data\nin reality. Existing methods addressing data deficiency either cannot provide\nsatisfied representations for downstream tasks or require too much effort to\nconstruct similar and dissimilar pairs to learn informative representations. In\nthis paper, we propose a straightforward but effective approach to learn ECG\nrepresentations. Inspired by the temporal and spatial characteristics of ECG,\nwe flip the original signals horizontally, vertically, and both horizontally\nand vertically. The learning is then done by classifying the four types of\nsignals including the original one. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed\ntemporal-spatial (T-S) reverse detection method, we conduct a downstream task\nto detect atrial fibrillation (AF) which is one of the most common ECG tasks.\nThe results show that the ECG representations learned with our method lead to\nremarkable performances on the downstream task. In addition, after exploring\nthe representational feature space and investigating which parts of the ECG\nsignal contribute to the representations, we conclude that the temporal reverse\nis more effective than the spatial reverse for learning ECG representations.",

This led to the\ndevelopment of large-scale hate speech detection datasets of various domains,\nwhich are mainly built upon web-crawled texts with labels by crowd workers.\nHowever, for languages other than English, researchers might have to rely on\nonly a small-sized corpus due to the lack of data-driven research of hate\nspeech detection. This sometimes misleads the evaluation of prevalently used\npretrained language models (PLMs) such as BERT, given that PLMs often share the\ndomain of pretraining corpus with the evaluation set, resulting in\nover-representation of the detection performance. Also, the scope of pejorative\nexpressions might be restricted if the dataset is built on a single domain\ntext.\nTo alleviate the above problems in Korean hate speech detection, we propose\nAPEACH,a method that allows the collection of hate speech generated by\nunspecified users. By controlling the crowd-generation of hate speech and\nadding only a minimum post-labeling, we create a corpus that enables the\ngeneralizable and fair evaluation of hate speech detection regarding text\ndomain and topic. We Compare our outcome with prior work on an annotation-based\ntoxic news comment dataset using publicly available PLMs. We check that our\ndataset is less sensitive to the lexical overlap between the evaluation set and\npretraining corpus of PLMs, showing that it helps mitigate the unexpected\nunder/over-representation of model performance.

    "abstract": "The bin packing problem exists widely in real logistic scenarios (e.g.,\npacking pipeline, express delivery), with its goal to improve the packing\nefficiency and reduce the transportation cost. In this NP-hard combinatorial\noptimization problem, the position and quantity of each item in the box are\nstrictly restricted by complex constraints and special customer requirements.\nExisting approaches are hard to obtain the optimal solution since rigorous\nconstraints cannot be handled within a reasonable computation load. In this\npaper, for handling this difficulty, the packing knowledge is extracted from\nhistorical data collected from the packing pipeline of Huawei. First, by fully\nexploiting the relationship between historical packing records and input\norders(orders to be packed) , the problem is reformulated as a set cover\nproblem. Then, two novel strategies, the constraint handling and process\nacceleration strategies are applied to the classic column generation approach\nto solve this set cover problem. The cost of solving pricing problem for\ngenerating new columns is high due to the complex constraints and customer\nrequirements. The proposed constraints handling strategy exploits the\nhistorical packing records with the most negative value of the reduced cost.\nThose constraints have been implicitly satisfied in these historical packing\nrecords so that there is no need to conduct further evaluation on constraints,\nthus the computational load is saved. To further eliminate the iteration\nprocess of column generation algorithm and accelerate the optimization process,\na Learning to Price approach called Modified Pointer Network is proposed, by\nwhich we can determine which historical packing records should be selected\ndirectly.

Furthermore, as multimedia content improves the visibility of posts\nmore than text data, it has been observed that often multimedia is being used\nfor creating fake content. A plethora of previous multimodal-based work has\ntried to address the problem of modeling heterogeneous modalities in\nidentifying fake content. However, these works have the following limitations:\n(1) inefficient encoding of inter-modal relations by utilizing a simple\nconcatenation operator on the modalities at a later stage in a model, which\nmight result in information loss; (2) training very deep neural networks with a\ndisproportionate number of parameters on small but complex real-life multimodal\ndatasets result in higher chances of overfitting.

Moreover, modeling spatiotemporal traffic flow\npatterns requires extensive data over a longer time period, whereas evacuations\ntypically last for 2 to 5 days. In this paper, we present a novel data-driven\napproach for predicting evacuation traffic at a network scale. We develop a\ndynamic graph convolution LSTM (DGCN-LSTM) model to learn the network dynamics\nof hurricane evacuation. We first train the model for non-evacuation period\ntraffic data showing that the model outperforms existing deep learning models\nfor predicting non-evacuation period traffic with an RMSE value of 226.84.\nHowever, when we apply the model for evacuation period, the RMSE value\nincreased to 1440.99. We overcome this issue by adopting a transfer learning\napproach with additional features related to evacuation traffic demand such as\ndistance from the evacuation zone, time to landfall, and other zonal level\nfeatures to control the transfer of information (network dynamics) from\nnon-evacuation periods to evacuation periods. The final transfer learned\nDGCN-LSTM model performs well to predict evacuation traffic flow (RMSE=399.69).\nThe implemented model can be applied to predict evacuation traffic over a\nlonger forecasting horizon (6 hour).

We\nalso show that, counter-intuitively, the black-box verification technique is\neffective for all datasets used in this paper, even when white-box verification\nis not. Given this observation, we show that the confidence in white-box\nverification can be improved by using watermarked samples directly during the\nverification process. We also highlight the need to assess the robustness of\nradioactive data if it were to be used for ownership demonstration since it is\nan adversarial setting unlike provenance identification.\nCompared to dataset watermarking, ML model watermarking has been explored\nmore extensively in recent literature. However, most of the model watermarking\ntechniques can be defeated via model extraction. We show that radioactive data\ncan effectively survive model extraction attacks, which raises the possibility\nthat it can be used for ML model ownership verification robust against model\nextraction.",

To improve the\nefficiency of the exploration process, a fast and autonomous exploration\nplanner (FAEP) is proposed in this paper. We firstly design a novel frontiers\nexploration sequence generation method to obtain a more reasonable exploration\npath, which considers not only the flight-level but frontier-level factors into\nTSP. According to the exploration sequence and the distribution of frontiers, a\ntwo-stage heading planning strategy is proposed to cover more frontiers by\nheading change during an exploration journey. To improve the stability of path\nsearching, a guided kinodynamic path searching based on a guiding path is\ndevised. In addition, a dynamic start point selection method for replanning is\nalso adopted to increase the fluency of flight. We present sufficient benchmark\nand real-world experiments. Experimental results show the superiority of the\nproposed exploration planner compared with typical and state-of-the-art\nmethods.",

    "title": "Asyncval: A Toolkit for Asynchronously Validating Dense Retriever  Checkpoints during Training",
    "abstract": "The process of model checkpoint validation refers to the evaluation of the\nperformance of a model checkpoint executed on a held-out portion of the\ntraining data while learning the hyperparameters of the model, and is used to\navoid over-fitting and determine when the model has converged so as to stop\ntraining. A simple and efficient strategy to validate deep learning checkpoints\nis the addition of validation loops to execute during training. However, the\nvalidation of dense retrievers (DR) checkpoints is not as trivial -- and the\naddition of validation loops is not efficient. This is because, in order to\naccurately evaluate the performance of a DR checkpoint, the whole document\ncorpus needs to be encoded into vectors using the current checkpoint before any\nactual retrieval operation for checkpoint validation can be performed. This\ncorpus encoding process can be very time-consuming if the document corpus\ncontains millions of documents (e.g., 8.8m for MS MARCO and 21m for Natural\nQuestions). Thus, a naive use of validation loops during training will\nsignificantly increase training time. To address this issue, in this demo\npaper, we propose Asyncval: a Python-based toolkit for efficiently validating\nDR checkpoints during training. Instead of pausing the training loop for\nvalidating DR checkpoints, Asyncval decouples the validation loop from the\ntraining loop, uses another GPU to automatically validate new DR checkpoints\nand thus permits to perform validation asynchronously from training. Asyncval\nalso implements a range of different corpus subset sampling strategies for\nvalidating DR checkpoints; these strategies allow to further speed up the\nvalidation process. We provide an investigation of these methods in terms of\ntheir impact on validation time and validation fidelity. Asyncval is made\navailable as an open-source project at \\url{https://github.com/ielab/asyncval}.",

Existing MDR methods often employ a shared\nstructure to leverage reusable features for all domains and several specific\nparts to capture domain-specific information. However, data from different\ndomains may conflict with each other and cause shared parameters to stay at a\ncompromised position on the optimization landscape. This could deteriorate the\noverall performance. Despite the specific parameters are separately learned for\neach domain, they can easily overfit on data sparsity domains. Furthermore,\ndata distribution differs across domains, making it challenging to develop a\ngeneral model that can be applied to all circumstances. To address these\nproblems, we propose a novel model agnostic learning method, namely MAMDR, for\nthe multi-domain recommendation. Specifically, we first propose a Domain\nNegotiation (DN) strategy to alleviate the conflict between domains and learn\nbetter shared parameters. Then, we develop a Domain Regularization (DR) scheme\nto improve the generalization ability of specific parameters by learning from\nother domains. Finally, we integrate these components into a unified framework\nand present MAMDR which can be applied to any model structure to perform\nmulti-domain recommendation.

The manipulation is performed by\nbreaking the symmetry method with an underactuated control system by\nbifurcating the object to clockwise or counter-clockwise rotations. Two soft\nsensors are embedded in parallel over a single soft finger, and the difference\nin the resistance measurements is compared when the finger is displaced or bent\nin a particular direction, which can identify the bifurcation direction and aid\nin the break of symmetry approach without the need of external tracking\ndevices.

The embedded sensors provide a self-sensing capability\nfor implementing a closed-loop control in future work.

We show results on gray scale square evaluation maps, also on black\nand white and gray scale 28x28 MNIST images and finally on black and white\n512x512 standard test images. We compare our solution with standard edge\ndetection filters such as Sobel and Canny. Finally, using the fully digital\ndesign simulation results, we report on timing and resource characteristics,\nand evaluate its feasibility for real-time image processing applications. Our\ndigital ONN-HAM solution can process images with up to 120x120 pixels (166 MHz\nsystem frequency) respecting real-time camera constraints. This work is the\nfirst to explore ONNs as hetero-associative memory for image processing\napplications.",

The generalizability of the\napproach is demonstrated in simulated and real-world experiments, on robots\nwith fixed or mobile bases, with moving or fixed objects, and multiple objects.\nThe experiments revealed a trade-off between occlusion rates and other task\nmetrics. While a planning-based baseline achieved lower occlusion rates than\nthe proposed controller, it came at the expense of highly inefficient paths and\na significant drop in the task success. On the other hand, the proposed\ncontroller is shown to improve visibility to the line target object(s) without\nsacrificing too much from the task success and efficiency.

While these two\ngraph-theoretic concepts stem from the electric network on an undirected graph,\nthey have a number of applications over not only that but also a wide variety\nof fields. In this paper, we propose a generalization of Kron reduction to\ndirected graphs. Furthermore, we prove this reduction method preserves the\nstructure of the original graphs such as strong connectivity or weight\nbalancedness. Also, we generalize the effective resistance to directed graphs\nvia Markov chain theory, which is invariant under Kron reduction. Although the\neffective resistance of our proposal is asymmetric, we prove that it induces\nthe novel graph metric on strongly connected directed graphs. Finally, we\ncompare our method with existing studies and prove that the hitting probability\nmetric is the logarithm of the effective resistance in the stochastic case, and\nthe effective resistance in the doubly stochastic case is the same with the\nresistance distance on ergodic Markov chain.",

To efficiently gather the contributions of the VPLs, lightcuts and its\nextensions cluster the VPLs, which implicitly approximates the lighting matrix\nwith some representative blocks similar to vector quantization. In this paper,\nwe propose a new approximation method based on the previous lightcut method and\na low-rank matrix factorization model. As many researchers pointed out, the\nlighting matrix is low rank, which implies that it can be completed from a\nsmall set of known entries.\nWe first generate a conservative global light cut with bounded error and\npartition the lighting matrix into slices by the coordinate and normal of the\nsurface points using the method of lightslice. Then we perform two passes of\nrandomly sampling on each matrix slice. In the first pass, uniformly\ndistributed random entries are sampled to coarsen the global light cut, further\nclustering the similar light for the spatially localized surface points of the\nslices. In the second pass, more entries are sampled according to the\npossibility distribution function estimated from the first sampling result.\nThen each matrix slice is factorized into a product of two smaller low-rank\nmatrices constrained by the sampled entries, which delivers a completion of the\nlighting matrix. The factorized form provides an additional speedup for adding\nup the matrix columns which is more GPU friendly. Compared with the previous\nlightcut based methods, we approximate the lighting matrix with some signal\nspecialized bases via factorization. The experimental results shows that we can\nachieve significant acceleration than the state of the art many-light methods.",

    "abstract": "We consider learning a trading agent acting on behalf of the treasury of a\nfirm earning revenue in a foreign currency (FC) and incurring expenses in the\nhome currency (HC). The goal of the agent is to maximize the expected HC at the\nend of the trading episode by deciding to hold or sell the FC at each time step\nin the trading episode. We pose this as an optimization problem, and consider a\nbroad spectrum of approaches with the learning component ranging from\nsupervised to imitation to reinforcement learning. We observe that most of the\napproaches considered struggle to improve upon simple heuristic baselines. We\nidentify two key aspects of the problem that render standard solutions\nineffective - i) while good forecasts of future FX rates can be highly\neffective in guiding good decisions, forecasting FX rates is difficult, and\nerroneous estimates tend to degrade the performance of trading agents instead\nof improving it, ii) the inherent non-stationary nature of FX rates renders a\nfixed decision-threshold highly ineffective. To address these problems, we\npropose a novel supervised learning approach that learns to forecast the top-K\nfuture FX rates instead of forecasting all the future FX rates, and bases the\nhold-versus-sell decision on the forecasts (e.g. hold if future FX rate is\nhigher than current FX rate, sell otherwise). Furthermore, to handle the\nnon-stationarity in the FX rates data which poses challenges to the i.i.d.\nassumption in supervised learning methods, we propose to adaptively learn\ndecision-thresholds based on recent historical episodes. Through extensive\nempirical evaluation, we show that our approach is the only approach which is\nable to consistently improve upon a simple heuristic baseline. Further\nexperiments show the inefficacy of state-of-the-art statistical and\ndeep-learning-based forecasting methods as they degrade the performance of the\ntrading agent.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a stabilising model predictive control (MPC) scheme with\npreview information of disturbance for nonlinear systems. The proposed MPC\nalgorithm is able to not only reject disturbance by making use of disturbance\npreview information as necessary, but also take advantage of the disturbance if\nit is good for a control task. This is realised by taking into account both the\ntask (e.g. reference trajectory) and disturbance preview in the prediction\nhorizon when performing online optimisation. Conditions are established to\nensure recursive feasibility and stability under the disturbance. First the\ndisturbance within the horizon is augmented with the state to form a new\ncomposite system and then the stage cost function is modified accordingly. With\nthe help of input-to-state stability theory, a terminal cost and a terminal\nconstraint are constructed and added to the MPC algorithm with preview to\nguarantee its recursive feasibility and stability under a pre-bounded\ndisturbance. Numerical simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed MPC algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Accurate traffic forecasting, the foundation of intelligent transportation\nsystems (ITS), has never been more significant than nowadays due to the\nprosperity of the smart cities and urban computing. Recently, Graph Neural\nNetwork truly outperforms the traditional methods. Nevertheless, the most\nconventional GNN based model works well while given a pre-defined graph\nstructure. And the existing methods of defining the graph structures focus\npurely on spatial dependencies and ignored the temporal correlation. Besides,\nthe semantics of the static pre-defined graph adjacency applied during the\nwhole training progress is always incomplete, thus overlooking the latent\ntopologies that may fine-tune the model. To tackle these challenges, we\nproposed a new traffic forecasting framework--Spatio-Temporal Latent Graph\nStructure Learning networks (ST-LGSL). More specifically, the model employed a\ngraph generator based on Multilayer perceptron and K-Nearest Neighbor, which\nlearns the latent graph topological information from the entire data\nconsidering both spatial and temporal dynamics. Furthermore, with the\ninitialization of MLP-kNN based on ground-truth adjacency matrix and similarity\nmetric in kNN, ST-LGSL aggregates the topologies focusing on geography and node\nsimilarity. Additionally, the generated graphs act as the input of\nspatio-temporal prediction module combined with the Diffusion Graph\nConvolutions and Gated Temporal Convolutions Networks. Experimental results on\ntwo benchmarking datasets in real world demonstrate that ST-LGSL outperforms\nvarious types of state-of-art baselines.",

    "abstract": "Elkind et al. (AAAI, 2021) introduced a model for deliberative coalition\nformation, where a community wishes to identify a strongly supported proposal\nfrom a space of alternatives, in order to change the status quo. In their\nmodel, agents and proposals are points in a metric space, agents' preferences\nare determined by distances, and agents deliberate by dynamically forming\ncoalitions around proposals that they prefer over the status quo. The\ndeliberation process operates via k-compromise transitions, where agents from k\n(current) coalitions come together to form a larger coalition in order to\nsupport a (perhaps new) proposal, possibly leaving behind some of the\ndissenting agents from their old coalitions. A deliberation succeeds if it\nterminates by identifying a proposal with the largest possible support. For\ndeliberation in d dimensions, Elkind et al. consider two variants of their\nmodel: in the Euclidean model, proposals and agent locations are points in R^d\nand the distance is measured according to ||...||_2; and in the hypercube\nmodel, proposals and agent locations are vertices of the d-dimensional\nhypercube and the metric is the Hamming distance. They show that in the\ncontinuous model 2-compromises are guaranteed to succeed, but in the discrete\nmodel for deliberation to succeed it may be necessary to use k-compromises with\nk >= d. We complement their analysis by (1) proving that in both models it is\nhard to find a proposal with a high degree of support, and even a 2-compromise\ntransition may be hard to compute; (2) showing that a sequence of 2-compromise\ntransitions may be exponentially long; (3) strengthening the lower bound on the\nsize of the compromise for the d-hypercube model from d to 2^{\\Omega(d)}.",

The proposed\nmethodology combines a multi-dimensional time series forecast and a novel\napproach to large-scale optimization. Gradient-boosting method is applied to\nforecast both generation and consumption time-series of the Monash university\ncampus for the month of November 2020. For the consumption forecasts we employ\nlog transformation to model trend and stabilize variance. Additional\nseasonality and trend features are added to the model inputs when applicable.\nThe forecasts obtained are used as the base load for the schedule optimisation\nof university activities and battery usage. The goal of the optimisation is to\nminimize the electricity cost consisting of the price of electricity and the\npeak electricity tariff both altered by the load from class activities and\nbattery use as well as the penalty of not scheduling some optional activities.\nThe schedule of the class activities is obtained through evolutionary\noptimisation using the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy and the\ngenetic algorithm. This schedule is then improved through local search by\ntesting possible times for each activity one-by-one. The battery schedule is\nformulated as a mixed-integer programming problem and solved by the Gurobi\nsolver. This method obtains the second lowest cost when evaluated against 6\nother methods presented at an IEEE competition that all used mixed-integer\nprogramming and the Gurobi solver to schedule both the activities and the\nbattery use.",

    "abstract": "An inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) agent learns to act intelligently by\nobserving expert demonstrations and learning the expert's underlying reward\nfunction. Although learning the reward functions from demonstrations has\nachieved great success in various tasks, several other challenges are mostly\nignored. Firstly, existing IRL methods try to learn the reward function from\nscratch without relying on any prior knowledge. Secondly, traditional IRL\nmethods assume the reward functions are homogeneous across all the\ndemonstrations. Some existing IRL methods managed to extend to the\nheterogeneous demonstrations. However, they still assume one hidden variable\nthat affects the behavior and learn the underlying hidden variable together\nwith the reward from demonstrations. To solve these issues, we present Context\nHierarchy IRL(CHIRL), a new IRL algorithm that exploits the context to scale up\nIRL and learn reward functions of complex behaviors. CHIRL models the context\nhierarchically as a directed acyclic graph; it represents the reward function\nas a corresponding modular deep neural network that associates each network\nmodule with a node of the context hierarchy. The context hierarchy and the\nmodular reward representation enable data sharing across multiple contexts and\nstate abstraction, significantly improving the learning performance. CHIRL has\na natural connection with hierarchical task planning when the context hierarchy\nrepresents subtask decomposition. It enables to incorporate the prior knowledge\nof causal dependencies of subtasks and make it capable of solving large complex\ntasks by decoupling it into several subtasks and conquering each subtask to\nsolve the original task. Experiments on benchmark tasks, including a large\nscale autonomous driving task in the CARLA simulator, show promising results in\nscaling up IRL for tasks with complex reward functions.",

    "abstract": "Objective. Deep neural networks (DNN) have shown unprecedented success in\nvarious brain-machine interface (BCI) applications such as epileptic seizure\nprediction. However, existing approaches typically train models in a\npatient-specific fashion due to the highly personalized characteristics of\nepileptic signals. Therefore, only a limited number of labeled recordings from\neach subject can be used for training. As a consequence, current DNN based\nmethods demonstrate poor generalization ability to some extent due to the\ninsufficiency of training data. On the other hand, patient-independent models\nattempt to utilize more patient data to train a universal model for all\npatients by pooling patient data together. Despite different techniques\napplied, results show that patient-independent models perform worse than\npatient-specific models due to high individual variation across patients. A\nsubstantial gap thus exists between patient-specific and patient-independent\nmodels. In this paper, we propose a novel training scheme based on knowledge\ndistillation which makes use of a large amount of data from multiple subjects.\nIt first distills informative features from signals of all available subjects\nwith a pre-trained general model. A patient-specific model can then be obtained\nwith the help of distilled knowledge and additional personalized data.\nSignificance. The proposed training scheme significantly improves the\nperformance of patient-specific seizure predictors and bridges the gap between\npatient-specific and patient-independent predictors. Five state-of-the-art\nseizure prediction methods are trained on the CHB-MIT sEEG database with our\nproposed scheme. The resulting accuracy, sensitivity, and false prediction rate\nshow that our proposed training scheme consistently improves the prediction\nperformance of state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.",

    "abstract": "The neoRL framework for purposive AI implements latent learning by emulated\ncognitive maps, with general value functions (GVF) expressing operant desires\ntoward separate states. The agent's expectancy of reward, expressed as learned\nprojections in the considered space, allows the neoRL agent to extract\npurposive behavior from the learned map according to the reward hypothesis. We\nexplore this allegory further, considering neoRL modules as nodes in a network\nwith desire as input and state-action Q-value as output; we see that action\nsets with Euclidean significance imply an interpretation of state-action\nvectors as Euclidean projections of desire. Autonomous desire from neoRL nodes\nwithin the agent allows for deeper neoRL behavioral graphs. Experiments confirm\nthe effect of neoRL networks governed by autonomous desire, verifying the four\nprinciples for purposive networks. A neoRL agent governed by purposive networks\ncan navigate Euclidean spaces in real-time while learning, exemplifying how\nmodern AI still can profit from inspiration from early psychology.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we present new constructive methods, random and deterministic,\nfor the efficient subsampling of finite frames in $\\mathbb C^m$. Based on a\nsuitable random subsampling strategy, we are able to extract from any given\nframe with bounds $0 < A \\le B < \\infty$ (and condition $B/A$) a similarly\nconditioned reweighted subframe consisting of merely $\\mathcal O(m \\log m)$\nelements. Further, utilizing a deterministic subsampling method based on\nprinciples developed in [1, Sec. 3], we are able to reduce the number of\nelements to $\\mathcal O(m)$ (with a constant close to one). By controlling the\nweights via a preconditioning step, we can, in addition, preserve the lower\nframe bound in the unweighted case. This allows to derive new quasi-optimal\nunweighted (left) Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund inequalities for $L_2(D, \\nu)$ with\nconstructible node sets of size $\\mathcal O(m)$ for $m$-dimensional subspaces\nof bounded functions. Those can be applied e.g. for (plain) least-squares\nsampling reconstruction of functions, where we obtain new quasi-optimal results\navoiding the Kadison-Singer theorem.

    "abstract": "Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR), deemed as one challenging extension of\nthe Visual Question Answering (VQA), endeavors to pursue a more high-level\nvisual comprehension. It is composed of two indispensable processes: question\nanswering over a given image and rationale inference for answer explanation.\nOver the years, a variety of methods tackling VCR have advanced the performance\non the benchmark dataset. Despite significant as these methods are, they often\ntreat the two processes in a separate manner and hence decompose the VCR into\ntwo irrelevant VQA instances. As a result, the pivotal connection between\nquestion answering and rationale inference is interrupted, rendering existing\nefforts less faithful on visual reasoning. To empirically study this issue, we\nperform some in-depth explorations in terms of both language shortcuts and\ngeneralization capability to verify the pitfalls of this treatment. Based on\nour findings, in this paper, we present a plug-and-play knowledge distillation\nenhanced framework to couple the question answering and rationale inference\nprocesses. The key contribution is the introduction of a novel branch, which\nserves as the bridge to conduct processes connecting. Given that our framework\nis model-agnostic, we apply it to the existing popular baselines and validate\nits effectiveness on the benchmark dataset.

    "abstract": "A common belief in designing deep autoencoders (AEs), a type of unsupervised\nneural network, is that a bottleneck is required to prevent learning the\nidentity function. Learning the identity function renders the AEs useless for\nanomaly detection. In this work, we challenge this limiting belief and\ninvestigate the value of non-bottlenecked AEs.\nThe bottleneck can be removed in two ways: (1) overparameterising the latent\nlayer, and (2) introducing skip connections. However, limited works have\nreported on the use of one of the ways. For the first time, we carry out\nextensive experiments covering various combinations of bottleneck removal\nschemes, types of AEs and datasets. In addition, we propose the infinitely-wide\nAEs as an extreme example of non-bottlenecked AEs.\nTheir improvement over the baseline implies learning the identity function is\nnot trivial as previously assumed. Moreover, we find that non-bottlenecked\narchitectures (highest AUROC=0.857) can outperform their bottlenecked\ncounterparts (highest AUROC=0.696) on the popular task of CIFAR (inliers) vs\nSVHN (anomalies), among other tasks, shedding light on the potential of\ndeveloping non-bottlenecked AEs for improving anomaly detection.",

Specifically, two AS schemes, namely max-$\\SUu$ and\nmax-$\\SUuu$, are proposed to maximize the end-to-end\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio at either or both near and far users,\nrespectively. Moreover, a two-stage AS scheme, namely quality-of-service (QoS)\nprovisioning scheme, is designed to realize a specific rate at the far user\nwhile improving the near user's rate. To enhance the performance of the QoS\nprovisioning AS scheme, the idea of dynamic antenna clustering is applied at\nthe relay to adaptively partition the relay's antennas into transmit and\nreceive subsets. The proposed AS schemes' exact outage probability and\nachievable rate expressions are derived. To provide more insight, closed-form\nasymptotic outage probability expressions for the max-$\\SUu$ and max-$\\SUuu$ AS\nschemes are obtained.

We start by establishing convergence\nrates to functions from periodic Sobolev spaces and we show that the saturation\nrate is $O(h^{2}),$ where $h$ is the scale of the Gaussian kernel. Taken from a\ndiscrete point of view, this result can be interpreted as the accuracy that can\nbe achieved on the uniform grid with spacing $h.$ In the discrete setting, the\ncurse of dimensionality would place severe restrictions on the computation of\nthe approximation.

To overcome this we introduce a sparse grid\nversion of Gaussian convolution approximation, where substantially fewer grid\npoints are required, and\nshow that the sparse grid version delivers a saturation rate of\n$O(n^{d-1}2^{-2n}).$ This rate is in line with what one would expect in the\nsparse grid setting (where the full grid error only deteriorates by a factor of\norder $n^{d-1}$) however the analysis that leads to the result is novel in that\nit draws on results from the theory of special functions and key observations\nregarding the form of certain weighted geometric sums.",

Existing methods, however, are often\ndominated by one or few of modalities during model training, resulting in\nsub-optimal performance. In this paper, we refer to this problem as modality\nbias and attempt to study it in the context of multi-modal classification\nsystematically and comprehensively. After stepping into several empirical\nanalysis, we recognize that one modality affects the model prediction more just\nbecause this modality has a spurious correlation with instance labels. In order\nto primarily facilitate the evaluation on the modality bias problem, we\nconstruct two datasets respectively for the colored digit recognition and video\naction recognition tasks in line with the Out-of-Distribution (OoD) protocol.\nCollaborating with the benchmarks in the visual question answering task, we\nempirically justify the performance degradation of the existing methods on\nthese OoD datasets, which serves as evidence to justify the modality bias\nlearning. In addition, to overcome this problem, we propose a plug-and-play\nloss function method, whereby the feature space for each label is adaptively\nlearned according to the training set statistics. Thereafter, we apply this\nmethod on eight baselines in total to test its effectiveness. From the results\non four datasets regarding the above three tasks, our method yields remarkable\nperformance improvements compared with the baselines, demonstrating its\nsuperiority on reducing the modality bias problem.",

Prior studies had success in\nreconstructing either the low-level image features or the semantic/high-level\naspects, but rarely both. In this study, we utilized an Instance-Conditioned\nGAN (IC-GAN) model to reconstruct images from fMRI patterns with both accurate\nsemantic attributes and preserved low-level details. The IC-GAN model takes as\ninput a 119-dim noise vector and a 2048-dim instance feature vector extracted\nfrom a target image via a self-supervised learning model (SwAV ResNet-50);\nthese instance features act as a conditioning for IC-GAN image generation,\nwhile the noise vector introduces variability between samples. We trained ridge\nregression models to predict instance features, noise vectors, and dense\nvectors (the output of the first dense layer of the IC-GAN generator) of\nstimuli from corresponding fMRI patterns. Then, we used the IC-GAN generator to\nreconstruct novel test images based on these fMRI-predicted variables. The\ngenerated images presented state-of-the-art results in terms of capturing the\nsemantic attributes of the original test images while remaining relatively\nfaithful to low-level image details.

    "abstract": "Background: The performance of biometric modalities based on things done by\nthe subject, like signature and text-based recognition, may be affected by the\nsubject state. Fatigue is one of the conditions that can significantly affect\nthe outcome of handwriting tasks. Recent research has already shown that\nphysical fatigue produces measurable differences in some features extracted\nfrom common writing and drawing tasks. It is important to establish to which\nextent physical fatigue contributes to the intra-person variability observed in\nthese biometric modalities and also to know whether the performance of\nrecognition methods is affected by fatigue. Goal: In this paper we assess the\nimpact of fatigue on intra-user variability and on the performance of\nsignature-based and text-based writer recognition approaches encompassing both\nidentification and verification. Methods: Several signature and text\nrecognition methods are considered and applied to samples gathered after\ndifferent levels of induced fatigue, measured by metabolic and mechanical\nassessment and, also by subjective perception. The recognition methods are\nDynamic Time Warping and Multi Section Vector Quantization, for signatures, and\nAllographic Text-Dependent Recognition for text in capital letters. For each\nfatigue level, the identification and verification performance of these methods\nis measured. Results: Signature shows no statistically significant intra-user\nimpact, but text does. On the other hand, performance of signature-based\nrecognition approaches is negatively impacted by fatigue whereas the impact is\nnot noticeable in text-based recognition, provided long enough sequences are\nconsidered.",

    "abstract": "Entropy is a fundamental concept of information theory. It is widely used in\nthe analysis of analog and digital signals. Conventional entropy measures have\ndrawbacks, such as sensitivity to the length and amplitude of time series and\nlow robustness to external noise. Recently, the NNetEn entropy measure has been\nintroduced to overcome these problems. The NNetEn entropy uses a modified\nversion of the LogNNet neural network classification model. The algorithm\ncontains a reservoir matrix with N = 19625 elements, which the given time\nseries should fill. Many practical time series have less than 19625 elements.\nAgainst this background, this paper investigates different duplicating and\nstretching techniques for filling to overcome this difficulty. The most\nsuccessful technique is identified for practical applications. The presence of\nexternal noise and bias are other important issues affecting the efficiency of\nentropy measures. In order to perform meaningful analysis, three time series\nwith different dynamics (chaotic, periodic, and binary), with a variation of\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and offsets, are considered. It is shown that the\nerror in the calculation of the NNetEn entropy does not exceed 10% when the SNR\nexceeds 30 dB. This opens the possibility of measuring the NNetEn of\nexperimental signals in the presence of noise of various nature, white noise,\nor 1/f noise, without the need for noise filtering.",

    "abstract": "This work presents a new approach to efficiently model the cathode in the\nmoving boundary value problem of electrochemical machining. Until recently, the\nprocess simulation with finite elements had the drawback of remeshing required\nby the changing surface geometries. This disadvantage was overcome by a novel\nmodel formulation for the anodic dissolution that utilizes effective material\nparameters as well as the dissolution level as an internal variable and,\nthereby, does not require remeshing. Now, we extend this concept to model\narbitrarily shaped and moving cathodes. Two methodologies are investigated to\ndescribe the time varying position of the cathode. In the first approach, we\nchange the electric conductivity of elements within the cathode and, in a\nsecond approach, we apply Dirichlet boundary conditions on the nodes of\ncorresponding elements. For both methods, elements on the cathode's surface are\ntreated with effective material parameters. This procedure allows for the\nefficient simulation of industrially relevant, complex geometries without mesh\nadaptation. The model's performance is validated by means of analytical,\nnumerical and experimental results from the literature. The short computation\ntimes make the approach interesting for industrial applications.",

Secondly, they can maintain considerably high resolutions\non solving problems with high-order critical points at long output times.\nThirdly, they can obtain evidently higher resolution in the region with\nhigh-frequency but smooth waves.

While these methods improve performance of Automatic Speech\nRecognition (ASR) systems, they have one major limitation. They treat all\nunsupervised speech samples with equal weight, which hinders learning as not\nall samples have relevant information to learn meaningful representations. In\nthis work, we address this limitation. We propose ask2mask (ATM), a novel\napproach to focus on specific samples during MSM pre-training. ATM employs an\nexternal ASR model or \\textit{scorer} to weight unsupervised input samples in\ntwo different ways: 1) A fine-grained data selection is performed by masking\nover the highly confident input frames as chosen by the scorer. This allows the\nmodel to learn meaningful representations. 2) ATM is further extended to focus\nat utterance-level by weighting the final MSM loss with the utterance-level\nconfidence score. We conduct fine-tuning experiments on two well-benchmarked\ncorpora: LibriSpeech (matching the pre-training data) and Commonvoice,\nTED-LIUM, AMI and CHiME-6 (not matching the pre-training data). The results\nsubstantiate the efficacy of ATM on significantly improving the recognition\nperformance under mismatched conditions (up to 11.6\\% relative over published\nresults and upto 4.46\\% relative over our internal baseline) while still\nyielding modest improvements under matched conditions.",

One example is\nMultivariate Exponential Smoothing Long Short-Term Memory (MES-LSTM), a hybrid\nbetween a multivariate statistical forecasting model and a Recurrent Neural\nNetwork variant, Long Short-Term Memory. It has also been shown that a model\nthat ($i$) produces accurate forecasts and ($ii$) is able to quantify the\nassociated predictive uncertainty satisfactorily, can be successfully adapted\nto a model suitable for anomaly detection tasks. With the increasing ubiquity\nof multivariate data and new application domains, there have been numerous\nanomaly detection methods proposed in recent years. The proposed methods have\nlargely focused on deep learning techniques, which are prone to suffer from\nchallenges such as ($i$) large sets of parameters that may be computationally\nintensive to tune, $(ii)$ returning too many false positives rendering the\ntechniques impractical for use, $(iii)$ requiring labeled datasets for training\nwhich are often not prevalent in real life, and ($iv$) understanding of the\nroot causes of anomaly occurrences inhibited by the predominantly black-box\nnature of deep learning methods.

The accuracy of these\nmappings is shown by simulating sampled distributions through uncertain\ntransition events and comparing the resulting covariances. Finally, we\nintegrate these additional terms into the \"uncertainty aware Salted Kalman\nFilter\", uaSKF, and show a peak reduction in average estimation error by 24-60%\non a variety of test conditions and systems.",

Additionally, we introduce linear matrix\ninequalities (LMIs) to verify the necessary incremental input/output-to-state\nstability ($\\delta$-IOSS) detectability condition. We consider an MHE\nformulation with time-discounted quadratic objective for nonlinear systems\nadmitting an exponential $\\delta$-IOSS Lyapunov function. We show that with a\nsuitable parameterization of the MHE objective, the $\\delta$-IOSS Lyapunov\nfunction serves as an $M$-step Lyapunov function for MHE. Provided that the\nestimation horizon is chosen large enough, this directly implies exponential\nstability of MHE. The stability analysis is also applicable to full information\nestimation, where the restriction to exponential $\\delta$-IOSS can be relaxed.\nMoreover, we provide simple LMI conditions to systematically derive\n$\\delta$-IOSS Lyapunov functions, which allows us to easily verify\n$\\delta$-IOSS for a large class of nonlinear detectable systems. This is useful\nin the context of MHE in general, since most of the existing nonlinear (robust)\nstability results for MHE depend on the system being $\\delta$-IOSS\n(detectable). In combination, we thus provide sufficient conditions that\ndirectly provide a framework to design MHE schemes with guaranteed robust\nexponential stability. The applicability of the overall MHE design is\ndemonstrated with a nonlinear chemical reactor process.",

However, for non-IID scenarios, the\nclassification accuracy of FL models decreases drastically due to the weight\ndivergence caused by data heterogeneity. Although various FL variants have been\nstudied to improve model accuracy, most of them still suffer from the problem\nof non-negligible communication and computation overhead. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel FL approach named Fed-Cat that can achieve high model\naccuracy based on our proposed device selection strategy and device\nconcatenation-based local training method. Unlike conventional FL methods that\naggregate local models trained on individual devices, FedCat periodically\naggregates local models after their traversals through a series of logically\nconcatenated devices, which can effectively alleviate the model weight\ndivergence problem. Comprehensive experimental results on four well-known\nbenchmarks show that our approach can significantly improve the model accuracy\nof state-of-the-art FL methods without causing extra communication overhead.",

    "abstract": "Commercial organisations continue to face a growing and evolving threat of\ndata breaches and system compromises, making their cyber-security function\ncritically important. Many organisations employ a Chief Information Security\nOfficer (CISO) to lead such a function. We conducted in-depth, semi-structured\ninterviews with 15 CISOs and six senior organisational leaders, between October\n2019 and July 2020, as part of a wider exploration into the purpose of CISOs\nand cyber-security functions. In this paper, we employ broader security\nscholarship related to ontological security and sociological notions of\nidentity work to provide an interpretative analysis of the CISO role in\norganisations. Research findings reveal that cyber security is an expert system\nthat positions the CISO as an interpreter of something that is mystical,\nunknown and fearful to the uninitiated. They show how the fearful nature of\ncyber security contributes to it being considered an ontological threat by the\norganisation, while responding to that threat contributes to the organisation's\noverall identity. We further show how cyber security is analogous to a belief\nsystem and how one of the roles of the CISO is akin to that of a modern-day\nsoothsayer for senior management; that this role is precarious and, at the same\ntime, superior, leading to alienation within the organisation. Our study also\nhighlights that the CISO identity of protector-from-threat, linked to the\nprecarious position, motivates self-serving actions that we term `cyber\nsophistry'. We conclude by outlining a series of implications for both\norganisations and CISOs.",

The outcome of the game is a sequence of\ndistributions over the states of the game graph. We consider synchronizing\nobjectives, which require the probability mass to accumulate in a set of target\nstates, either always, once, infinitely often, or always after some point in\nthe outcome sequence; and the winning modes of sure winning (if the accumulated\nprobability is equal to 1) and almost-sure winning (if the accumulated\nprobability is arbitrarily close to 1).\nWe present algorithms to compute the set of winning distributions for each of\nthese synchronizing modes, showing that the corresponding decision problem is\nPSPACE-complete for synchronizing once and infinitely often, and PTIME-complete\nfor synchronizing always and always after some point. These bounds are\nremarkably in line with the special case of MDPs, while the algorithmic\nsolution and proof technique are considerably more involved, even for\ndeterministic games. This is because those games have a flavour of imperfect\ninformation, in particular they are not determined and randomized strategies\nneed to be considered, even if there is no stochastic choice in the game graph.\nMoreover, in combination with stochasticity in the game graph, finite-memory\nstrategies are not sufficient in general (for synchronizing infinitely often).",

    "abstract": "Amplification and phase shift in ordering signals, commonly referred to as\nbullwhip, are responsible for both excessive strain on real world inventory\nmanagement systems, stock outs, and unnecessary capital reservation though\nsafety stock building. Bullwhip is a classic, yet persisting, problem with\nreverberating consequences in inventory management. Research on bullwhip has\nconsistently emphasized behavioral influences for this phenomenon and leveraged\nbehavioral ordering models to suggest interventions. However more recent\nmodel-free approaches have also seen success. In this work, the author develops\nalgorithmic approaches towards mitigating bullwhip using both behaviorally\ngrounded model-based approaches alongside a model-free dual deep Q-network\nreinforcement learning approach. In addition to exploring the utility of this\nspecific model-free architecture to multi-echelon supply chains with imperfect\ninformation sharing and information delays, the author directly compares the\nperformance of these model-based and model-free approaches. In doing so, this\nwork highlights both the insights gained from exploring model-based approaches\nin the context of prior behavioral operations management literature and\nemphasizes the complementary nature of model-based and model-free approaches in\napproaching behaviorally grounded supply chain management problems.",

    "abstract": "In urban cities, visual information along and on roadways is likely to\ndistract drivers and leads to missing traffic signs and other accident-prone\nfeatures. As a solution to avoid accidents due to missing these visual cues,\nthis paper proposes a visual notification of accident-prone features to\ndrivers, based on real-time images obtained via dashcam. For this purpose,\nGoogle Street View images around accident hotspots (areas of dense accident\noccurrence) identified by accident dataset are used to train a family of deep\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs). Trained CNNs are able to detect\naccident-prone features and classify a given urban scene into an accident\nhotspot and a non-hotspot (area of sparse accident occurrence). For given\naccident hotspot, the trained CNNs can classify it into an accident hotspot\nwith the accuracy up to 90%. The capability of detecting accident-prone\nfeatures by the family of CNNs is analyzed by a comparative study of four\ndifferent class activation map (CAM) methods, which are used to inspect\nspecific accident-prone features causing the decision of CNNs, and pixel-level\nobject class classification. The outputs of CAM methods are processed by an\nimage processing pipeline to extract only the accident-prone features that are\nexplainable to drivers with the help of visual notification system. To prove\nthe efficacy of accident-prone features, an ablation study is conducted.\nAblation of accident-prone features taking 7.7%, on average, of total area in\neach image sample causes up to 13.7% more chance of given area to be classified\nas a non-hotspot.",

    "abstract": "Given a set of points in a metric space, the $(k,z)$-clustering problem\nconsists of finding a set of $k$ points called centers, such that the sum of\ndistances raised to the power of $z$ of every data point to its closest center\nis minimized. Special cases include the famous k-median problem ($z = 1$) and\nk-means problem ($z = 2$). The $k$-median and $k$-means problems are at the\nheart of modern data analysis and massive data applications have given raise to\nthe notion of coreset: a small (weighted) subset of the input point set\npreserving the cost of any solution to the problem up to a multiplicative $(1\n\\pm \\varepsilon)$ factor, hence reducing from large to small scale the input to\nthe problem.\nIn this paper, we present improved lower bounds for coresets in various\nmetric spaces. In finite metrics consisting of $n$ points and doubling metrics\nwith doubling constant $D$, we show that any coreset for $(k,z)$ clustering\nmust consist of at least $\\Omega(k \\varepsilon^{-2} \\log n)$ and $\\Omega(k\n\\varepsilon^{-2} D)$ points, respectively. Both bounds match previous upper\nbounds up to polylog factors. In Euclidean spaces, we show that any coreset for\n$(k,z)$ clustering must consists of at least $\\Omega(k\\varepsilon^{-2})$\npoints.

    "abstract": "Grasping has long been considered an important and practical task in robotic\nmanipulation. Yet achieving robust and efficient grasps of diverse objects is\nchallenging, since it involves gripper design, perception, control and\nlearning, etc. Recent learning-based approaches have shown excellent\nperformance in grasping a variety of novel objects. However, these methods\neither are typically limited to one single grasping mode, or else more end\neffectors are needed to grasp various objects. In addition, gripper design and\nlearning methods are commonly developed separately, which may not adequately\nexplore the ability of a multimodal gripper. In this paper, we present a deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) framework to achieve multistage hybrid robotic\ngrasping with a new soft multimodal gripper. A soft gripper with three grasping\nmodes (i.e., \\textit{enveloping}, \\textit{sucking}, and\n\\textit{enveloping\\_then\\_sucking}) can both deal with objects of different\nshapes and grasp more than one object simultaneously. We propose a novel hybrid\ngrasping method integrated with the multimodal gripper to optimize the number\nof grasping actions. We evaluate the DRL framework under different scenarios\n(i.e., with different ratios of objects of two grasp types). The proposed\nalgorithm is shown to reduce the number of grasping actions (i.e., enlarge the\ngrasping efficiency, with maximum values of 161\\% in simulations and 154\\% in\nreal-world experiments) compared to single grasping modes.",

The control objective is to\ntrack the intake manifold pressure and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rate\ntargets by manipulating the EGR valve and variable geometry turbine (VGT) while\nsatisfying state and control constraints. The MPC controller is designed and\nverified using a high-fidelity engine model in GT-Power. The controller\nexploits a low-order rate-based linear parameter-varying (LPV) model for\nprediction which is identified from transient response data generated by the\nGT-Power model. It is shown that transient engine thermal dynamics influence\nthe airpath dynamics, specifically the intake manifold pressure response,\nhowever, MPC demonstrates robustness against inaccuracies in modeling these\nthermal dynamics. In particular, we show that MPC can be successfully\nimplemented using a rate-based prediction model with two inputs (EGR and VGT\npositions) identified from data with steady-state wall temperature dynamics,\nhowever, closed-loop performance can be improved if a prediction model (i) is\nidentified from data with transient thermal dynamics, and (ii) has the fuel\ninjection rate as extra model input. Further, the MPC calibration process\nacross the engine operating range to achieve improved performance is addressed.\nAs the MPC calibration is shown to be sensitive to the operating conditions, a\nfast calibration process is proposed.",

We selected a total of 71 articles and analyzed them\nthematically. The results of this study indicate that idea generation through\nmachine-driven analytics applies text mining, information retrieval (IR),\nartificial intelligence (AI), deep learning, machine learning, statistical\ntechniques, natural language processing (NLP), NLP-based morphological\nanalysis, network analysis, and bibliometric to support idea generation. The\nresults include a list of techniques and procedures in idea generation through\nmachine-driven idea analytics. Additionally, characterization and heuristics\nused in idea generation are summarized. For the future, tools designed to\ngenerate ideas could be explored.",

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has a broad application prospect in the future,\nespecially in the Industry 4.0. The development of Internet of Drones (IoD)\nmakes UAV operation more autonomous. Network virtualization technology is a\npromising technology to support IoD, so the allocation of virtual resources\nbecomes a crucial issue in IoD. How to rationally allocate potential material\nresources has become an urgent problem to be solved. The main work of this\npaper is presented as follows: (1) In order to improve the optimization\nperformance and reduce the computation time, we propose a multi-domain virtual\nnetwork embedding algorithm (MP-VNE) adopting the centralized hierarchical\nmulti-domain architecture. The proposed algorithm can avoid the local optimum\nthrough incorporating the genetic variation factor into the traditional\nparticle swarm optimization process. (2) In order to simplify the\nmulti-objective optimization problem, we transform the multi-objective problem\ninto a single-objective problem through weighted summation method. The results\nprove that the proposed algorithm can rapidly converge to the optimal solution.\n(3) In order to reduce the mapping cost, we propose an algorithm for selecting\ncandidate nodes based on the estimated mapping cost. Each physical domain\ncalculates the estimated mapping cost of all nodes according to the formula of\nthe estimated mapping cost, and chooses the node with the lowest estimated\nmapping cost as the candidate node. The simulation results show that the\nproposed MP-VNE algorithm has better performance than MC-VNM, LID-VNE and other\nalgorithms in terms of delay, cost and comprehensive indicators.",

    "title": "Morphology Without Borders: Clause-Level Morphological Annotation",
    "abstract": "Morphological tasks use large multi-lingual datasets that organize words into\ninflection tables, which then serve as training and evaluation data for various\ntasks. However, a closer inspection of these data reveals profound\ncross-linguistic inconsistencies, that arise from the lack of a clear\nlinguistic and operational definition of what is a word, and that severely\nimpair the universality of the derived tasks. To overcome this deficiency, we\npropose to view morphology as a clause-level phenomenon, rather than\nword-level. It is anchored in a fixed yet inclusive set of features homogeneous\nacross languages, that encapsulates all functions realized in a saturated\nclause. We deliver MightyMorph, a novel dataset for clause-level morphology\ncovering 4 typologically-different languages: English, German, Turkish and\nHebrew. We use this dataset to derive 3 clause-level morphological tasks:\ninflection, reinflection and analysis. Our experiments show that the\nclause-level tasks are substantially harder than the respective word-level\ntasks, while having comparable complexity across languages. Furthermore,\nredefining morphology to the clause-level provides a neat interface with\ncontextualized language models (LMs) and can be used to probe LMs capacity to\nencode complex morphology. Taken together, this work opens up new horizons in\nthe study of computational morphology, leaving ample space for studying neural\nmorphological modeling cross-linguistically.",

    "abstract": "Relative camera pose estimation plays a pivotal role in dealing with 3D\nreconstruction and visual localization. To address this, we propose a Siamese\nnetwork based on MobileNetV3-Large for an end-to-end relative camera pose\nregression independent of camera parameters. The proposed network uses pair of\nimages taken at different locations in the same scene to estimate the 3D\ntranslation vector and rotation vector in unit quaternion. To increase the\ngenerality of the model, rather than training it for a single scene, data for\nfour scenes are combined to train a single universal model to estimate the\nrelative pose. Further for independency of hyperparameter weighing between\ntranslation and rotation loss is not used. Instead we use the novel two-stage\ntraining procedure to learn the balance implicitly with faster convergence. We\ncompare the results obtained with the Cambridge Landmarks dataset, comprising\nof different scenes, with existing CNN-based regression methods as baselines,\ne.g., RPNet and RCPNet. The findings indicate that, when compared to RCPNet,\nproposed model improves the estimation of the translation vector by a\npercentage change of 16.11%, 28.88%, 52.27% on the Kings College, Old Hospital,\nSt Marys Church scenes from Cambridge Landmarks dataset, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The performance of online convex optimization algorithms in a dynamic\nenvironment is often expressed in terms of the dynamic regret, which measures\nthe decision maker's performance against a sequence of time-varying\ncomparators. In the analysis of the dynamic regret, prior works often assume\nLipschitz continuity or uniform smoothness of the cost functions. However,\nthere are many important cost functions in practice that do not satisfy these\nconditions. In such cases, prior analyses are not applicable and fail to\nguarantee the optimization performance. In this letter, we show that it is\npossible to bound the dynamic regret, even when neither Lipschitz continuity\nnor uniform smoothness is present. We adopt the notion of relative smoothness\nwith respect to some user-defined regularization function, which is a much\nmilder requirement on the cost functions. We first show that under relative\nsmoothness, the dynamic regret has an upper bound based on the path length and\nfunctional variation. We then show that with an additional condition of\nrelatively strong convexity, the dynamic regret can be bounded by the path\nlength and gradient variation. These regret bounds provide performance\nguarantees to a wide variety of online optimization problems that arise in\ndifferent application domains. Finally, we present numerical experiments that\ndemonstrate the advantage of adopting a regularization function under which the\ncost functions are relatively smooth.",

    "abstract": "We develop a hierarchical controller for multi-agent autonomous racing. A\nhigh-level planner approximates the race as a discrete game with simplified\ndynamics that encodes the complex safety and fairness rules seen in real-life\nracing and calculates a series of target waypoints. The low-level controller\ntakes the resulting waypoints as a reference trajectory and computes\nhigh-resolution control inputs by solving a simplified formulation of a\nmulti-agent racing game. We consider two approaches for the low-level planner\nto construct two hierarchical controllers. One approach uses multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL), and the other solves a linear-quadratic Nash\ngame (LQNG) to produce control inputs. We test the controllers against three\nbaselines: an end-to-end MARL controller, a MARL controller tracking a fixed\nracing line, and an LQNG controller tracking a fixed racing line. Quantitative\nresults show that the proposed hierarchical methods outperform their respective\nbaseline methods in terms of head-to-head race wins and abiding by the rules.\nThe hierarchical controller using MARL for low-level control consistently\noutperformed all other methods by winning over 88\\% of head-to-head races and\nmore consistently adhered to the complex racing rules. Qualitatively, we\nobserve the proposed controllers mimicking actions performed by expert human\ndrivers such as shielding/blocking, overtaking, and long-term planning for\ndelayed advantages. We show that hierarchical planning for game-theoretic\nreasoning produces competitive behavior even when challenged with complex rules\nand constraints.",

    "abstract": "The population protocol model describes a network of anonymous agents that\ninteract asynchronously in pairs chosen at random. Each agent starts in the\nsame initial state $s$. We introduce the *dynamic size counting* problem:\napproximately counting the number of agents in the presence of an adversary who\nat any time can remove any number of agents or add any number of new agents in\nstate $s$. A valid solution requires that after each addition/removal event,\nresulting in population size $n$, with high probability each agent \"quickly\"\ncomputes the same constant-factor estimate of the value $\\log_2 n$ (how quickly\nis called the *convergence* time), which remains the output of every agent for\nas long as possible (the *holding* time). Since the adversary can remove\nagents, the holding time is necessarily finite: even after the adversary stops\naltering the population, it is impossible to *stabilize* to an output that\nnever again changes.\nWe first show that a protocol solves the dynamic size counting problem if and\nonly if it solves the *loosely-stabilizing counting* problem: that of\nestimating $\\log n$ in a *fixed-size* population, but where the adversary can\ninitialize each agent in an arbitrary state, with the same convergence time and\nholding time. We then show a protocol solving the loosely-stabilizing counting\nproblem with the following guarantees: if the population size is $n$, $M$ is\nthe largest initial estimate of $\\log n$, and s is the maximum integer\ninitially stored in any field of the agents' memory, we have expected\nconvergence time $O(\\log n + \\log M)$, expected polynomial holding time, and\nexpected memory usage of $O(\\log^2 (s) + (\\log \\log n)^2)$ bits. Interpreted as\na dynamic size counting protocol, when changing from population size $n_{prev}$\nto $n_{next}$, the convergence time is $O(\\log n_{next} + \\log \\log n_{prev})$.",

Yet there exists little\nempirical research on how audio-visual information influences people's\nsusceptibility to fall for political misinformation. The conventional wisdom in\nthe field of communication research predicts that people will fall for fake\nnews more often when the same version of a story is presented as a video as\nopposed to text. However, audio-visual manipulations often leave distortions\nthat some but not all people may pick up on. Here, we evaluate how\ncommunication modalities influence people's ability to discern real political\nspeeches from fabrications based on a randomized experiment with 5,727\nparticipants who provide 61,792 truth discernment judgments. We show\nparticipants soundbites from political speeches that are randomly assigned to\nappear using permutations of text, audio, and video modalities. We find that\ncommunication modalities mediate discernment accuracy: participants are more\naccurate on video with audio than silent video, and more accurate on silent\nvideo than text transcripts. Likewise, we find participants rely more on how\nsomething is said (the audio-visual cues) rather than what is said (the speech\ncontent itself). However, political speeches that do not match public\nperceptions of politicians' beliefs reduce participants' reliance on visual\ncues. In particular, we find that reflective reasoning moderates the degree to\nwhich participants consider visual information: low performance on the\nCognitive Reflection Test is associated with an underreliance on visual cues\nand an overreliance on what is said.",

When\ndata are scarce, the model might overfit to the training data, and hence good\nstarting points for training are essential. Recently, meta-learning was\nproposed to learn model initialization (MI) for ASR tasks of different\nlanguages. This method leads to good performance when the model is adapted to\nan unseen language. However, MI is vulnerable to overfitting on training tasks\n(learner overfitting). It is also unknown whether MI generalizes to other\nlow-resource tasks. In this paper, we validate the effectiveness of MI in\nchildren's ASR and attempt to alleviate the problem of learner overfitting. To\nachieve model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML), we regard children's speech at\neach age as a different task. In terms of learner overfitting, we propose a\ntask-level augmentation method by simulating new ages using frequency warping\ntechniques. Detailed experiments are conducted to show the impact of task\naugmentation on each age for kindergarten-aged speech. As a result, our\napproach achieves a relative word error rate (WER) improvement of 51% over the\nbaseline system with no augmentation or initialization.",

    "title": "Can autonomy make bicycle-sharing systems more sustainable?  Environmental impact analysis of an emerging mobility technology",
    "abstract": "Autonomous bicycles have recently been proposed as a new and more efficient\napproach to bicycle-sharing systems (BSS), but the corresponding environmental\nimplications remain unresearched. Conducting environmental impact assessments\nat an early technological stage is critical to influencing the design and,\nultimately, environmental impacts of a system. Consequently, this paper aims to\nassess the environmental impact of autonomous shared bikes compared with\ncurrent station-based and dockless systems under different sets of modeling\nhypotheses and mode-shift scenarios. The results indicate that autonomy could\nreduce the environmental impact per passenger kilometer traveled of current\nstation-based and dockless BSS by 33.1 % and 58.0 %. The sensitivity analysis\nshows that the environmental impact of autonomous shared bicycles will mainly\ndepend on vehicle usage rates and the need for infrastructure. Finally, this\nstudy highlights the importance of targeting the mode replacement from more\npolluting modes, especially as traditional mobility modes decarbonize and\nbecome more efficient.",

    "abstract": "Battery energy storage system (BESS) can effectively mitigate the uncertainty\nof variable renewable generation. Degradation is un-preventable for batteries\nsuch as the most popular Lithium-ion battery (LiB). The main causes of LiB\ndegradation are loss of Li-ions, loss of electrolyte, and increase of internal\nresistance which are hard to model and predict. In this paper, we propose a\ndata driven method to predict the battery degradation per a given scheduled\nbattery operational profile. Particularly, a neural net-work based battery\ndegradation (NNBD) model is proposed to quantify the battery degradation with\ninputs of major battery degradation factors. When incorporating the proposed\nNNBD model into microgrid day-ahead scheduling (MDS), we can estab-lish a\nbattery degradation based MDS (BDMDS) model that can consider the equivalent\nbattery degradation cost precisely. Since the proposed NNBD model is highly\nnon-linear and non-convex, BDMDS would be very hard to solve. To address this\nissue, a neural network and optimization decoupled heuristic (NNODH) algorithm\nis proposed in this paper to effectively solve this neural network embedded\noptimization problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed NNODH\nalgorithm is able to ob-tain the optimal solution with lowest total cost\nincluding normal operation cost and battery degradation cost.",

Utilizing patient tabular data such as demographics\nand patient medical history alongside imaging data in a multimodal approach to\nsolve a prognosis task has started to gain more interest recently and has the\npotential to create more accurate solutions. The main issue when using clinical\nand imaging data to train a deep learning model is to decide on how to combine\nthe information from these sources.

Currently, deep learning-based methods have achieved impressive\nperformance on these tasks. Yet, most of them mainly focus on finding powerful\ndeep architectures but ignore capturing the inherent curvilinear structure\nfeature (e.g., the curvilinear structure is darker than the context) for a more\nrobust representation. In consequence, the performance usually drops a lot on\ncross-datasets, which poses great challenges in practice. In this paper, we aim\nto improve the generalizability by introducing a novel local intensity order\ntransformation (LIOT). Specifically, we transfer a gray-scale image into a\ncontrast-invariant four-channel image based on the intensity order between each\npixel and its nearby pixels along with the four (horizontal and vertical)\ndirections. This results in a representation that preserves the inherent\ncharacteristic of the curvilinear structure while being robust to contrast\nchanges. Cross-dataset evaluation on three retinal blood vessel segmentation\ndatasets demonstrates that LIOT improves the generalizability of some\nstate-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the cross-dataset evaluation between\nretinal blood vessel segmentation and pavement crack segmentation shows that\nLIOT is able to preserve the inherent characteristic of curvilinear structure\nwith large appearance gaps.

To this end, we trained\na convolutional neural network (CNN) end-to-end to predict a 3D liver MRI that\ncorrectly predicts the liver's respiratory state from a live 2D navigator MRI\nof a subject. Our method can be used in two ways: First, it can reconstruct\nnear real-time 4D MRI with high quality and high resolution (209x128x128 matrix\nsize with isotropic 1.8mm voxel size and 0.6s/volume) given a dynamic\ninterventional 2D navigator slice for guidance during an intervention. Second,\nit can be used for retrospective 4D reconstruction with a temporal resolution\nof below 0.2s/volume for motion analysis and use in radiation therapy. We\nreport a mean target registration error (TRE) of 1.19 $\\pm$0.74mm, which is\nbelow voxel size. We compare our results with a state-of-the-art retrospective\n4D MRI reconstruction.

To this end, this paper presents a novel heterogeneous stochastic\nvariational linear model of coregionalization (HSVLMC) model for simultaneously\nlearning the tasks with varied input domains. Particularly, we develop the\nstochastic variational framework with a Bayesian calibration method that (i)\ntakes into account the effect of dimensionality reduction raised by domain\nmapping in order to achieve effective input alignment; and (ii) employs a\nresidual modeling strategy to leverage the inductive bias brought by prior\ndomain mappings for better model inference. Finally, the superiority of the\nproposed model against existing LMC models has been extensively verified on\ndiverse heterogeneous multi-task cases.",

Given the heterogeneity of PD, it\nis challenging to classify early stages 1 and 2 and detect brain function\nalterations. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a promising tool\nin revealing functional connectivity (FC) differences and developing biomarkers\nin PD. Some machine learning approaches like support vector machine and\nlogistic regression have been successfully applied in the early diagnosis of PD\nusing fMRI data, which outperform classifiers based on manually selected\nmorphological features. However, the early-stage characterization in FC changes\nhas not been fully investigated. Given the complexity and non-linearity of fMRI\ndata, we propose the use of a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to\ncharacterize the early stages of PD. The study included 84 subjects (56 in\nstage 2 and 28 in stage 1) from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative\n(PPMI), the largest available public PD dataset. Under a repeated 10-fold\nstratified cross-validation, the LSTM model reached an accuracy of 71.63%,\n13.52% higher than the best traditional machine learning method, indicating\nsignificantly better robustness and accuracy compared with other machine\nlearning classifiers.

    "abstract": "The simultaneous stochastic optimization of mining complexes (SSOMC) is a\nlarge-scale stochastic combinatorial optimization problem that simultaneously\nmanages the extraction of materials from multiple mines and their processing\nusing interconnected facilities to generate a set of final products, while\ntaking into account material supply (geological) uncertainty to manage the\nassociated risk. Although simulated annealing has been shown to outperform\ncomparing methods for solving the SSOMC, early performance might dominate\nrecent performance in that a combination of the heuristics' performance is used\nto determine which perturbations to apply. This work proposes a data-driven\nframework for heuristic scheduling in a fully self-managed hyper-heuristic to\nsolve the SSOMC. The proposed learn-to-perturb (L2P) hyper-heuristic is a\nmulti-neighborhood simulated annealing algorithm. The L2P selects the heuristic\n(perturbation) to be applied in a self-adaptive manner using reinforcement\nlearning to efficiently explore which local search is best suited for a\nparticular search point. Several state-of-the-art agents have been incorporated\ninto L2P to better adapt the search and guide it towards better solutions. By\nlearning from data describing the performance of the heuristics, a\nproblem-specific ordering of heuristics that collectively finds better\nsolutions faster is obtained. L2P is tested on several real-world mining\ncomplexes, with an emphasis on efficiency, robustness, and generalization\ncapacity. Results show a reduction in the number of iterations by 30-50% and in\nthe computational time by 30-45%.",

    "abstract": "Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects is an important problem across\nmany domains. In order to accurately estimate such treatment effects, one\ntypically relies on data from observational studies or randomized experiments.\nCurrently, most existing works rely exclusively on observational data, which is\noften confounded and, hence, yields biased estimates. While observational data\nis confounded, randomized data is unconfounded, but its sample size is usually\ntoo small to learn heterogeneous treatment effects. In this paper, we propose\nto estimate heterogeneous treatment effects by combining large amounts of\nobservational data and small amounts of randomized data via representation\nlearning. In particular, we introduce a two-step framework: first, we use\nobservational data to learn a shared structure (in form of a representation);\nand then, we use randomized data to learn the data-specific structures. We\nanalyze the finite sample properties of our framework and compare them to\nseveral natural baselines. As such, we derive conditions for when combining\nobservational and randomized data is beneficial, and for when it is not. Based\non this, we introduce a sample-efficient algorithm, called CorNet. We use\nextensive simulation studies to verify the theoretical properties of CorNet and\nmultiple real-world datasets to demonstrate our method's superiority compared\nto existing methods.",
