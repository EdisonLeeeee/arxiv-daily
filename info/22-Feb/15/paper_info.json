There have been various\nuntargeted attacks on FL, but they are not widely applicable as they i) assume\nthat the attacker knows every update of benign clients, which is indeed sent in\nencrypted form to the central server, or ii) assume that the attacker has a\nlarge dataset and sufficient resources to locally train updates imitating\nbenign parties. In this paper, we design a zero-knowledge untargeted attack\n(ZKA), which synthesizes malicious data to craft adversarial models without\neavesdropping on the transmission of benign clients at all or requiring a large\nquantity of task-specific training data. To inject malicious input into the FL\nsystem by synthetic data, ZKA has two variants. ZKA-R generates adversarial\nambiguous data by reversing engineering from the global models. To enable\nstealthiness, ZKA-G trains the local model on synthetic data from the generator\nthat aims to synthesize images different from a randomly chosen class.\nFurthermore, we add a novel distance-based regularization term for both attacks\nto further enhance stealthiness.

The basic setting of these optimization problems is as\nfollows: given an undirected graph $G$, what is the smallest number $|\\lambda|$\nof time-labels that we need to add to the edges of $G$ such that the resulting\ntemporal graph $(G,\\lambda)$ is temporally connected? As we prove, this basic\nproblem, called MINIMUM LABELING, can be optimally solved in polynomial time,\nthus resolving an open question. The situation becomes however more complicated\nif we strengthen, or even if we relax a bit, the requirement of temporal\nconnectivity of $(G,\\lambda)$. One way to strengthen the temporal connectivity\nrequirements is to upper-bound the allowed age (i.e., maximum label) of the\nobtained temporal graph $(G,\\lambda)$. On the other hand, we can relax temporal\nconnectivity by only requiring that there exists a temporal path between any\npair of ``important'' vertices which lie in a subset $R\\subseteq V$, which we\ncall the terminals. This relaxed problem, called MINIMUM STEINER LABELING,\nresembles the problem STEINER TREE in static (i.e., non-temporal) graphs;\nhowever, as it turns out, STEINER TREE is not a special case of MINIMUM STEINER\nLABELING. We prove that MINIMUM STEINER LABELING is NP-hard and in FPT with\nrespect to the number $|R|$ of terminals. Moreover, we prove that, adding the\nage restriction makes the above problems strictly harder (unless P=NP or\nW[1]=FPT). More specifically, we prove that the age-restricted version of\nMINIMUM LABELING becomes NP-complete on undirected graphs, while the\nage-restricted version of MINIMUM STEINER LABELING becomes W[1]-hard with\nrespect to the number $|R|$ of terminals.",

As the volume of\nimpressions, conversion rates and prices vary over time, these budget\nmanagement systems learn a spend plan (to find the optimal distribution of\nbudget over time) and run a pacing algorithm which follows the spend plan.\nThis paper considers two models for impressions and competition that varies\nwith time: a) an episodic model which exhibits stationarity in each episode,\nbut each episode can be arbitrarily different from the next, and b) a model\nwhere the distributions of prices and values change slowly over time. We\npresent the first learning theoretic guarantees on both the accuracy of spend\nplans and the resulting end-to-end budget management system.

    "abstract": "We give an efficient perfect sampling algorithm for weighted, connected\ninduced subgraphs (or graphlets) of rooted, bounded degree graphs under a\nvertex-percolation subcriticality condition. We show that this subcriticality\ncondition is optimal in the sense that the problem of (approximately) sampling\nweighted rooted graphlets becomes impossible for infinite graphs and\nintractable for finite graphs if the condition does not hold. We apply our\nrooted graphlet sampling algorithm as a subroutine to give a fast perfect\nsampling algorithm for polymer models and a fast perfect sampling algorithm for\nweighted non-rooted graphlets in finite graphs, two widely studied yet very\ndifferent problems. We apply this polymer model algorithm to give improved\nsampling algorithms for spin systems at low temperatures on expander graphs and\nother structured families of graphs: under the least restrictive conditions\nknown we give near linear-time algorithms, while previous algorithms in these\nregimes required large polynomial running times.",

To\naddress all these demands, 5G radio access technologies have been extended into\na wide range of new services. However, there are still only a limited number of\napplications for RF based wireless communications inside aircraft cabins that\ncomply with the 5G vision. Potential interference and safety issues in on-board\nwireless communications pose significant deployment challenges. By transforming\neach reading light into an optical wireless AP, LiFi, could provide seamless\non-board connectivity in dense cabin environments without RF interference.\nFurthermore, the utilization of available reading lights allows for a\nrelatively simple, cost-effective deployment with the high energy and spectral\nefficiency. To successfully implement the aeronautical cabin LiFi applications,\ncomprehensive optical channel characterization is required. In this paper, we\npropose a novel MCRT channel modelling technique to capture the details of\nin-flight LiFi links. Accordingly, a realistic channel simulator, which takes\nthe cabin models, interior elements and measurement based optical source,\nreceiver, surface material characteristics into account is developed. The\neffect of the operation wavelength, cabin model accuracy and user terminal\nmobility on the optical channel conditions is also investigated. As a final\nstep, the on-board DCO-OFDM performance is evaluated by using obtained\nin-flight LiFi channels.

    "abstract": "Image recognition is an essential task in several mobile applications. For\ninstance, a smartphone can process a landmark photo to gather more information\nabout its location. If the device does not have enough computational resources\navailable, it offloads the processing task to a cloud infrastructure. Although\nthis approach solves resource shortages, it introduces a communication delay.\nImage-recognition caches on the Internet's edge can mitigate this problem.\nThese caches run on servers close to mobile devices and stores information\nabout previously recognized images. If the server receives a request with a\nphoto stored in its cache, it replies to the device, avoiding cloud offloading.\nThe main challenge for this cache is to verify if the received image matches a\nstored one. Furthermore, for outdoor photos, it is difficult to compare them if\none was taken in the daytime and the other at nighttime. In that case, the\ncache might wrongly infer that they refer to different places, offloading the\nprocessing to the cloud. This work shows that a well-known generative\nadversarial network, called ToDayGAN, can solve this problem by generating\ndaytime images using nighttime ones. We can thus use this translation to\npopulate a cache with synthetic photos that can help image matching. We show\nthat our solution reduces cloud offloading and, therefore, the application's\nlatency.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an approach to detect out-of-context (OOC) objects in an\nimage. Given an image with a set of objects, our goal is to determine if an\nobject is inconsistent with the scene context and detect the OOC object with a\nbounding box. In this work, we consider commonly explored contextual relations\nsuch as co-occurrence relations, the relative size of an object with respect to\nother objects, and the position of the object in the scene. We posit that\ncontextual cues are useful to determine object labels for in-context objects\nand inconsistent context cues are detrimental to determining object labels for\nout-of-context objects. To realize this hypothesis, we propose a graph\ncontextual reasoning network (GCRN) to detect OOC objects. GCRN consists of two\nseparate graphs to predict object labels based on the contextual cues in the\nimage: 1) a representation graph to learn object features based on the\nneighboring objects and 2) a context graph to explicitly capture contextual\ncues from the neighboring objects. GCRN explicitly captures the contextual cues\nto improve the detection of in-context objects and identify objects that\nviolate contextual relations. In order to evaluate our approach, we create a\nlarge-scale dataset by adding OOC object instances to the COCO images. We also\nevaluate on recent OCD benchmark.

Genet is built on the\nconcept of curriculum learning, which has proved effective against similar\nissues in other domains where RL is extensively employed. At a high level,\ncurriculum learning gradually presents more difficult environments to the\ntraining, rather than choosing them randomly, so that the current RL model can\nmake meaningful progress in training. However, applying curriculum learning in\nnetworking is challenging because it remains unknown how to measure the\n\"difficulty\" of a network environment.\nInstead of relying on handcrafted heuristics to determine the environment's\ndifficulty level, our insight is to utilize traditional rule-based (non-RL)\nbaselines: If the current RL model performs significantly worse in a network\nenvironment than the baselines, then the model's potential to improve when\nfurther trained in this environment is substantial. Therefore, Genet\nautomatically searches for the environments where the current model falls\nsignificantly behind a traditional baseline scheme and iteratively promotes\nthese environments as the training progresses. Through evaluating Genet on\nthree use cases--adaptive video streaming, congestion control, and load\nbalancing, we show that Genet produces RL policies which outperform both\nregularly trained RL policies and traditional baselines in each context, not\nonly under synthetic workloads but also in real environments.",

We further disentangle the discovered clusters by\napproximating the underlying manifolds in the data, which allows us to increase\nnormalized mutual information and Fowlkes-Mallows scores by over 20% absolute.\nBuilding on these clustering results, we extend our approach to two new tasks:\npredicting the type name of the discovered clusters and linking them to\nFrameNet frames.",

    "title": "Open-set Adversarial Defense with Clean-Adversarial Mutual Learning",
    "abstract": "Open-set recognition and adversarial defense study two key aspects of deep\nlearning that are vital for real-world deployment. The objective of open-set\nrecognition is to identify samples from open-set classes during testing, while\nadversarial defense aims to robustify the network against images perturbed by\nimperceptible adversarial noise. This paper demonstrates that open-set\nrecognition systems are vulnerable to adversarial samples. Furthermore, this\npaper shows that adversarial defense mechanisms trained on known classes are\nunable to generalize well to open-set samples. Motivated by these observations,\nwe emphasize the necessity of an Open-Set Adversarial Defense (OSAD) mechanism.\nThis paper proposes an Open-Set Defense Network with Clean-Adversarial Mutual\nLearning (OSDN-CAML) as a solution to the OSAD problem. The proposed network\ndesigns an encoder with dual-attentive feature-denoising layers coupled with a\nclassifier to learn a noise-free latent feature representation, which\nadaptively removes adversarial noise guided by channel and spatial-wise\nattentive filters. Several techniques are exploited to learn a noise-free and\ninformative latent feature space with the aim of improving the performance of\nadversarial defense and open-set recognition. First, we incorporate a decoder\nto ensure that clean images can be well reconstructed from the obtained latent\nfeatures. Then, self-supervision is used to ensure that the latent features are\ninformative enough to carry out an auxiliary task. Finally, to exploit more\ncomplementary knowledge from clean image classification to facilitate feature\ndenoising and search for a more generalized local minimum for open-set\nrecognition, we further propose clean-adversarial mutual learning, where a peer\nnetwork (classifying clean images) is further introduced to mutually learn with\nthe classifier (classifying adversarial images).",

Many researchers have pointed out that after exploiting corrupted\nunlabeled data, SSL suffers severe performance degradation problems. Thus,\nthere is an urgent need to develop SSL algorithms that could work robustly with\ncorrupted unlabeled data. To fully understand robust SSL, we conduct a survey\nstudy. We first clarify a formal definition of robust SSL from the perspective\nof machine learning. Then, we classify the robustness threats into three\ncategories: i) distribution corruption, i.e., unlabeled data distribution is\nmismatched with labeled data; ii) feature corruption, i.e., the features of\nunlabeled examples are adversarially attacked; and iii) label corruption, i.e.,\nthe label distribution of unlabeled data is imbalanced.

Recently, kernel-prediction\nmethods use a neural network to predict each pixel's filtering kernel and have\nshown a great potential to remove Monte Carlo noise. However, the heavy\ncomputation overhead blocks these methods from real-time applications. This\npaper expands the kernel-prediction method and proposes a novel approach to\ndenoise very low spp (e.g., 1-spp) Monte Carlo path traced images at real-time\nframe rates. Instead of using the neural network to directly predict the kernel\nmap, i.e., the complete weights of each per-pixel filtering kernel, we predict\nan encoding of the kernel map, followed by a high-efficiency decoder with\nunfolding operations for a high-quality reconstruction of the filtering\nkernels. The kernel map encoding yields a compact single-channel representation\nof the kernel map, which can significantly reduce the kernel-prediction\nnetwork's throughput. In addition, we adopt a scalable kernel fusion module to\nimprove denoising quality. The proposed approach preserves kernel prediction\nmethods' denoising quality while roughly halving its denoising time for 1-spp\nnoisy inputs.

    "title": "Tight Approximation Algorithms for Two Dimensional Guillotine Strip  Packing",
    "abstract": "In the Strip Packing problem (SP), we are given a vertical half-strip\n$[0,W]\\times[0,\\infty)$ and a set of $n$ axis-aligned rectangles of width at\nmost $W$. The goal is to find a non-overlapping packing of all rectangles into\nthe strip such that the height of the packing is minimized. A well-studied and\nfrequently used practical constraint is to allow only those packings that are\nguillotine separable, i.e., every rectangle in the packing can be obtained by\nrecursively applying a sequence of edge-to-edge axis-parallel cuts (guillotine\ncuts) that do not intersect any item of the solution. In this paper, we study\napproximation algorithms for the Guillotine Strip Packing problem (GSP), i.e.,\nthe Strip Packing problem where we require additionally that the packing needs\nto be guillotine separable. This problem generalizes the classical Bin Packing\nproblem and also makespan minimization on identical machines, and thus it is\nalready strongly NP-hard. Moreover, due to a reduction from the Partition\nproblem, it is NP-hard to obtain a polynomial-time\n$(3/2-\\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for GSP for any $\\varepsilon>0$\n(exactly as Strip Packing). We provide a matching polynomial time\n$(3/2+\\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for GSP. Furthermore, we present a\npseudo-polynomial time $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for GSP. This\nis surprising as it is NP-hard to obtain a $(5/4-\\varepsilon)$-approximation\nalgorithm for (general) Strip Packing in pseudo-polynomial time. Thus, our\nresults essentially settle the approximability of GSP for both the polynomial\nand the pseudo-polynomial settings.",

    "abstract": "Given a directed graph $G$ and integers $k$ and $l$, a D-core is the maximal\nsubgraph $H \\subseteq G$ such that for every vertex of $H$, its in-degree and\nout-degree are no smaller than $k$ and $l$, respectively. For a directed graph\n$G$, the problem of D-core decomposition aims to compute the non-empty D-cores\nfor all possible values of $k$ and $l$. In the literature, several\n\\emph{peeling-based} algorithms have been proposed to handle D-core\ndecomposition. However, the peeling-based algorithms that work in a sequential\nfashion and require global graph information during processing are mainly\ndesigned for \\emph{centralized} settings, which cannot handle large-scale\ngraphs efficiently in distributed settings. Motivated by this, we study the\n\\emph{distributed} D-core decomposition problem in this paper. We start by\ndefining a concept called \\emph{anchored coreness}, based on which we propose a\nnew H-index-based algorithm for distributed D-core decomposition. Furthermore,\nwe devise a novel concept, namely \\emph{skyline coreness}, and show that the\nD-core decomposition problem is equivalent to the computation of skyline\ncorenesses for all vertices. We design an efficient D-index to compute the\nskyline corenesses distributedly. We implement the proposed algorithms under\nboth vertex-centric and block-centric distributed graph processing frameworks.\nMoreover, we theoretically analyze the algorithm and message complexities.\nExtensive experiments on large real-world graphs with billions of edges\ndemonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms in terms of both the\nrunning time and communication overhead.",

Unfortunately, for the learned models in these\nscientific applications to achieve generalization, a large, diverse, and\npreferably annotated dataset is typically needed and is computationally\nexpensive to obtain. Furthermore, the learned models tend to be memory- and\ncompute-intensive primarily due to the size of the output layer. While\ngeneralization, especially extrapolation, with scarce data has been attempted\nby imposing physical constraints in the form of physics loss, the problem of\nmodel scalability has remained.\nIn this paper, we alleviate the compute bottleneck in the output layer by\nusing physics knowledge to decompose the complex regression task of predicting\nthe high-dimensional eigenvectors into multiple simpler sub-tasks, each of\nwhich are learned by a simple \"expert\" network. We call the resulting\narchitecture of specialized experts Physics-Guided Mixture-of-Experts (PG-MoE).\nWe demonstrate the efficacy of such physics-guided problem decomposition for\nthe case of the Schr\\\"{o}dinger's Equation in Quantum Mechanics. Our proposed\nPG-MoE model predicts the ground-state solution, i.e., the eigenvector that\ncorresponds to the smallest possible eigenvalue. The model is 150x smaller than\nthe network trained to learn the complex task while being competitive in\ngeneralization. To improve the generalization of the PG-MoE, we also employ a\nphysics-guided loss function based on variational energy, which by quantum\nmechanics principles is minimized iff the output is the ground-state solution.",

We call such data multi-distributional\ndata streams, on which learning an on-the-fly expert for unseen samples with a\ndesirable generalization is demanding yet highly challenging owing to the\nmulti-distributional streaming nature, particularly when initially limited data\nis available for the online interval. To address these challenges, this work\nintroduces a novel optimization method named coupling online-offline learning\n(CO$_2$) with theoretical guarantees about the knowledge transfer, the regret,\nand the generalization error. CO$_2$ extracts knowledge by training an offline\nexpert for each offline interval and update an online expert by an\noff-the-shelf online optimization method in the online interval. CO$_2$ outputs\na hypothesis for each sample by adaptively coupling both the offline experts\nand the underlying online expert through an expert-tracking strategy to adapt\nto the dynamic environment.

However,\ndespite the success of IL algorithms, they impose the somewhat unrealistic\nrequirement that the expert demonstrations must come from the same domain in\nwhich a new imitator policy is to be learned. We consider a practical setting,\nwhere (i) state-only expert demonstrations from the real (deployment)\nenvironment are given to the learner, (ii) the imitation learner policy is\ntrained in a simulation (training) environment whose transition dynamics is\nslightly different from the real environment, and (iii) the learner does not\nhave any access to the real environment during the training phase beyond the\nbatch of demonstrations given. Most of the current IL methods, such as\ngenerative adversarial imitation learning and its state-only variants, fail to\nimitate the optimal expert behavior under the above setting. By leveraging\ninsights from the Robust reinforcement learning (RL) literature and building on\nrecent adversarial imitation approaches, we propose a robust IL algorithm to\nlearn policies that can effectively transfer to the real environment without\nfine-tuning.

By profiting from the\nconcepts and practices of the MPL approach, we want to design a SECO that makes\nthe real-time and automated flow of financial transaction data between market\nparticipants' software pieces possible. Method: We first provide some\nbackground information about the equity market, its participants and their\nrelations, and two primary order life-cycles in which these players cooperate.\nAfter that, we analyze the variability in each market participant's software.\nNext, we describe the employed architecture and the implementation approach.\nFinally, we discuss three scenarios by which the whole proposed SECO is tested\nand validated.

This task aims to retrieve the\npedestrian of interest from non-overlapping cameras. Recently,\ntransformer-based models have achieved significant progress for this task.\nHowever, these models still suffer from ignoring fine-grained, part-informed\ninformation. This paper proposes a multi-direction and multi-scale Pyramid in\nTransformer (PiT) to solve this problem. In transformer-based architecture,\neach pedestrian image is split into many patches. Then, these patches are fed\nto transformer layers to obtain the feature representation of this image. To\nexplore the fine-grained information, this paper proposes to apply vertical\ndivision and horizontal division on these patches to generate\ndifferent-direction human parts. These parts provide more fine-grained\ninformation. To fuse multi-scale feature representation, this paper presents a\npyramid structure containing global-level information and many pieces of\nlocal-level information from different scales. The feature pyramids of all the\npedestrian images from the same video are fused to form the final\nmulti-direction and multi-scale feature representation. Experimental results on\ntwo challenging video-based benchmarks, MARS and iLIDS-VID, show the proposed\nPiT achieves state-of-the-art performance.

In this context,\ntheoretical works on axiomatization of clustering algorithms, especially axioms\non clustering preserving transformations are quite a cheap way to produce\nlabeled data sets from existing ones. However, the frequently cited axiomatic\nsystem of Kleinberg:2002, as we show in this paper, is not applicable for\nfinite dimensional Euclidean spaces, in which many algorithms like $k$-means,\noperate. In particular, the so-called outer-consistency axiom fails upon making\nsmall changes in datapoint positions and inner-consistency axiom is valid only\nfor identity transformation in general settings.\nHence we propose an alternative axiomatic system, in which Kleinberg's inner\nconsistency axiom is replaced by a centric consistency axiom and outer\nconsistency axiom is replaced by motion consistency axiom. We demonstrate that\nthe new system is satisfiable for a hierarchical version of $k$-means with\nauto-adjusted $k$, hence it is not contradictory. Additionally, as $k$-means\ncreates convex clusters only, we demonstrate that it is possible to create a\nversion detecting concave clusters and still the axiomatic system can be\nsatisfied.

The timely processing of incoming\nstreams requires the network to transfer massive amounts of data, and\nsignificant compute resources to process it. These factors often create\nbottlenecks for stream analytics. To help overcome these bottlenecks, current\nmonitoring systems employ near-data processing by either computing an optimal\nquery partition based on a cost model or using model-agnostic heuristics.\nOptimal partitioning is computationally expensive, while model-agnostic\nheuristics are iterative and search over a large solution space. We combine\nthese approaches by using model-agnostic heuristics to improve the partitioning\nsolution from a model-based heuristic. Moreover, current systems use\noperator-level partitioning: if a data source does not have sufficient\nresources to execute an operator on all records, the operator is executed only\non the stream processor. Instead, we perform data-level partitioning, i.e., we\nallow an operator to be executed both on a stream processor and data sources.\nWe implement our algorithm in a system called Jarvis, which enables quick\nadaptation to dynamic resource conditions. Our evaluation on a diverse set of\nmonitoring workloads suggests that Jarvis converges to a stable query partition\nwithin seconds of a change in node resource conditions. Compared to current\npartitioning strategies, Jarvis handles up to 75% more data sources while\nimproving throughput in resource-constrained scenarios by 1.2-4.4x.",

    "abstract": "This work investigates the impact of fun selfie filters, which are frequently\nused to modify selfies, on face recognition systems. Based on a qualitative\nassessment and classification of freely available mobile applications, ten\nrelevant fun selfie filters are selected to create a database. To this end, the\nselected filters are automatically applied to face images of public face image\ndatabases. Different state-of-the-art methods are used to evaluate the\ninfluence of fun selfie filters on the performance of face detection using\ndlib, RetinaFace, and a COTS method, sample quality estimated by FaceQNet and\nMagFace, and recognition accuracy employing ArcFace and a COTS algorithm. The\nobtained results indicate that selfie filters negatively affect face\nrecognition modules, especially if fun selfie filters cover a large region of\nthe face, where the mouth, nose, and eyes are covered. To mitigate such\nunwanted effects, a GAN-based selfie filter removal algorithm is proposed which\nconsists of a segmentation module, a perceptual network, and a generation\nmodule. In a cross-database experiment the application of the presented selfie\nfilter removal technique has shown to significantly improve the biometric\nperformance of the underlying face recognition systems.",

    "abstract": "In point cloud compression, sufficient contexts are significant for modeling\nthe point cloud distribution. However, the contexts gathered by the previous\nvoxel-based methods decrease when handling sparse point clouds. To address this\nproblem, we propose a multiple-contexts deep learning framework called\nOctAttention employing the octree structure, a memory-efficient representation\nfor point clouds. Our approach encodes octree symbol sequences in a lossless\nway by gathering the information of sibling and ancestor nodes. Expressly, we\nfirst represent point clouds with octree to reduce spatial redundancy, which is\nrobust for point clouds with different resolutions. We then design a\nconditional entropy model with a large receptive field that models the sibling\nand ancestor contexts to exploit the strong dependency among the neighboring\nnodes and employ an attention mechanism to emphasize the correlated nodes in\nthe context. Furthermore, we introduce a mask operation during training and\ntesting to make a trade-off between encoding time and performance. Compared to\nthe previous state-of-the-art works, our approach obtains a 10%-35% BD-Rate\ngain on the LiDAR benchmark (e.g. SemanticKITTI) and object point cloud dataset\n(e.g. MPEG 8i, MVUB), and saves 95% coding time compared to the voxel-based\nbaseline.

    "abstract": "The stochastic nature of public transport systems leads to headway\nvariability and bus bunching, causing both operator and passenger cost to\nincrease significantly. Traditional strategies to counter bus bunching,\nincluding bus-holding, stop-skipping, and bus substitution/insertion, suffer\nfrom trade-offs and shortcomings. Autonomous modular vehicle (AMV) technology\nprovides an additional level of flexibility in bus dispatching and operations,\nwhich can offer significant benefits in mitigating bus bunching compared to\nstrategies available with conventional buses. This paper introduces a novel\nalternative to stop-skipping by leveraging the new capabilities offered by AMVs\n(in particular, en-route coupling and decoupling of modular units). We develop\na simple bus-splitting strategy that directs a modular bus to decouple into\nindividual units when it experiences a headway longer than a given threshold.\nWe then use a macroscopic simulation to present a proof-of-concept evaluation\nof the proposed modular strategy compared to a benchmark traditional\nstop-skipping strategy and the base (no control) case. We find that the\nproposed strategy outperforms the benchmark in decreasing each of the three\ntravel time components: waiting time, in-vehicle time, and walking time (which\nit eliminates completely). It therefore reduces the overhead of bus bunching\nand thus the travel cost by more than twice as much as the benchmark for busy\nbus lines. Simultaneously, it also reduces headway variability to a comparable\ndegree. Furthermore, we analyze different control thresholds for applying the\nproposed strategy, and show that it is most effective when applied proactively,\ni.e. with the control action being triggered even by small headway deviations.",

Unlike existing approaches, the newly proposed\ngeneralization bound is characterized by a time-variant effective dimension of\nfeature covariance. By introducing the time factor, we relax the strict\nassumption on the feature covariance matrix required in previous benign\noverfitting under the regimes of overparameterized linear regression with\ngradient descent. This paper extends the scope of benign overfitting, and\nexperiment results indicate that the proposed bound accords better with\nempirical evidence.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this paper is to develop a continuous optimization-based\nrefinement of the reference trajectory to 'push it out' of the\nobstacle-occupied space in the global phase for Multi-rotor Aerial Vehicles in\nunknown environments. Our proposed approach comprises two planners: a global\nplanner and a local planner. The global planner refines the initial reference\ntrajectory when the trajectory goes either through an obstacle or near an\nobstacle and lets the local planner calculate a near-optimal control policy.\nThe global planner comprises two convex programming approaches: the first one\nhelps to refine the reference trajectory, and the second one helps to recover\nthe reference trajectory if the first approach fails to refine. The global\nplanner mainly focuses on real-time performance and obstacles avoidance,\nwhereas the proposed formulation of the constrained nonlinear model predictive\ncontrol-based local planner ensures safety, dynamic feasibility, and the\nreference trajectory tracking accuracy for low-speed maneuvers, provided that\nlocal and global planners have mean computation times 0.06s (15Hz) and 0.05s\n(20Hz), respectively, on an NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX computer. The results of\nour experiment confirmed that, in cluttered environments, the proposed approach\noutperformed three other approaches: sampling-based pathfinding followed by\ntrajectory generation, a local planner, and graph-based pathfinding followed by\ntrajectory generation.",

    "abstract": "Depth can provide useful geographical cues for salient object detection\n(SOD), and has been proven helpful in recent RGB-D SOD methods. However,\nexisting video salient object detection (VSOD) methods only utilize\nspatiotemporal information and seldom exploit depth information for detection.\nIn this paper, we propose a depth-cooperated trimodal network, called DCTNet\nfor VSOD, which is a pioneering work to incorporate depth information to assist\nVSOD. To this end, we first generate depth from RGB frames, and then propose an\napproach to treat the three modalities unequally. Specifically, a multi-modal\nattention module (MAM) is designed to model multi-modal long-range dependencies\nbetween the main modality (RGB) and the two auxiliary modalities (depth,\noptical flow). We also introduce a refinement fusion module (RFM) to suppress\nnoises in each modality and select useful information dynamically for further\nfeature refinement. Lastly, a progressive fusion strategy is adopted after the\nrefined features to achieve final cross-modal fusion. Experiments on five\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our depth-cooperated model\nagainst 12 state-of-the-art methods, and the necessity of depth is also\nvalidated.",

    "abstract": "Local certification consists in assigning labels (called \\emph{certificates})\nto the nodes of a network to certify a property of the network or the\ncorrectness of a data structure distributed on the network. The verification of\nthis certification must be local: a node typically sees only its neighbors in\nthe network. The main measure of performance of a certification is the size of\nits certificates.\nIn 2011, G\\\"o\\\"os and Suomela identified $\\Theta(\\log n)$ as a special\ncertificate size: below this threshold little is possible, and several key\nproperties do have certifications of this type. A certification with such small\ncertificates is now called a \\emph{compact local certification}, and it has\nbecome the gold standard of the area, similarly to polynomial time for\ncentralized computing. A major question is then to understand which properties\nhave $O(\\log n)$ certificates, or in other words: what is the power of compact\nlocal certification?\nRecently, a series of papers have proved that several well-known network\nproperties have compact local certifications: planarity, bounded-genus, etc.\nBut one would like to have more general results, \\emph{i.e.} meta-theorems. In\nthe analogue setting of polynomial-time centralized algorithms, a very fruitful\napproach has been to prove that restricted types of problems can be solved in\npolynomial time in graphs with restricted structures. These problems are\ntypically those that can be expressed in some logic, and the graph structures\nare whose with bounded width or depth parameters. We take a similar approach\nand prove the first meta-theorems for local certification. (See the abstract of\nthe pdf for more details.)",

In this paper, we present a neural volumography\ntechnique called neural volumetric video or NeuVV to support immersive,\ninteractive, and spatial-temporal rendering of volumetric video contents with\nphoto-realism and in real-time. The core of NeuVV is to efficiently encode a\ndynamic neural radiance field (NeRF) into renderable and editable primitives.\nWe introduce two types of factorization schemes: a hyper-spherical harmonics\n(HH) decomposition for modeling smooth color variations over space and time and\na learnable basis representation for modeling abrupt density and color changes\ncaused by motion. NeuVV factorization can be integrated into a Video Octree\n(VOctree) analogous to PlenOctree to significantly accelerate training while\nreducing memory overhead. Real-time NeuVV rendering further enables a class of\nimmersive content editing tools. Specifically, NeuVV treats each VOctree as a\nprimitive and implements volume-based depth ordering and alpha blending to\nrealize spatial-temporal compositions for content re-purposing.

The deep neural network (DNN) models developed by\nthese entities are often trained on proprietary data. They require powerful\ncomputational resources, with the resulting DNN models being incorporated in\nthe company's work pipeline or provided as a service. Being trained on\nproprietary information, these models provide a competitive edge for the owner\ncompany. At the same time, these models can be attractive to competitors (or\nmalicious entities), which can employ state-of-the-art security attacks to\nsteal and use these models for their benefit. As these attacks are hard to\nprevent, it becomes imperative to have mechanisms that enable an affected\nentity to verify the ownership of a DNN with high confidence.\nThis paper presents TATTOOED, a robust and efficient DNN watermarking\ntechnique based on spread-spectrum channel coding. TATTOOED has a negligible\neffect on the performance of the DNN model and requires as little as one\niteration to watermark a DNN model. We extensively evaluate TATTOOED against\nseveral state-of-the-art mechanisms used to remove watermarks from DNNs.

The rapid growth of machine learning\ntechniques, particularly deep learning, can predict fake content in several\napplication domains, including fake image and video manipulation. This paper\npresents a comprehensive review of recent studies for deepfake content\ndetection using deep learning-based approaches.

    "title": "Improving Fraud detection via Hierarchical Attention-based Graph Neural  Network",
    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNN) have emerged as a powerful tool for fraud\ndetection tasks, where fraudulent nodes are identified by aggregating neighbor\ninformation via different relations. To get around such detection, crafty\nfraudsters resort to camouflage via connecting to legitimate users (i.e.,\nrelation camouflage) or providing seemingly legitimate feedbacks (i.e., feature\ncamouflage). A wide-spread solution reinforces the GNN aggregation process with\nneighbor selectors according to original node features. This method may carry\nlimitations when identifying fraudsters not only with the relation camouflage,\nbut with the feature camouflage making them hard to distinguish from their\nlegitimate neighbors. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Attention-based\nGraph Neural Network (HA-GNN) for fraud detection, which incorporates weighted\nadjacency matrices across different relations against camouflage. This is\nmotivated in the Relational Density Theory and is exploited for forming a\nhierarchical attention-based graph neural network. Specifically, we design a\nrelation attention module to reflect the tie strength between two nodes, while\na neighborhood attention module to capture the long-range structural affinity\nassociated with the graph. We generate node embeddings by aggregating\ninformation from local/long-range structures and original node features.\nExperiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nmodel over the state-of-the-arts.",

The proposed algorithm does not require parameter\nreadjustments, and once tuned, it converges for a wide range of P2P setups.\nMoreover, each prosumer only needs to share limited information (i.e., updated\ncoupled variable) with neighboring prosumers.

Human-robot interaction (HRI) therefore provides an important\napplied setting for human behavior modeling - but given the vast complexity of\nhuman behavior, how complete and accurate do these models need to be? Here, we\noutline some possible ways of thinking about this problem, starting from the\nsuggestion that modelers need to keep the right end goal in sight: A successful\nhuman-robot interaction, in terms of safety, performance, and human\nsatisfaction. Efforts toward model completeness and accuracy should be focused\non those aspects of human behavior to which interaction success is most\nsensitive. We emphasise that identifying which those aspects are is a difficult\nscientific objective in its own right, distinct for each given HRI context. We\npropose and exemplify an approach to formulating a priori hypotheses on this\nmatter, in cases where robots are to be involved in interactions which\ncurrently take place between humans, such as in automated driving.

    "abstract": "With the increasing demands on e-commerce platforms, numerous user action\nhistory is emerging. Those enriched action records are vital to understand\nusers' interests and intents. Recently, prior works for user behavior\nprediction mainly focus on the interactions with product-side information.\nHowever, the interactions with search queries, which usually act as a bridge\nbetween users and products, are still under investigated. In this paper, we\nexplore a new problem named temporal event forecasting, a generalized user\nbehavior prediction task in a unified query product evolutionary graph, to\nembrace both query and product recommendation in a temporal manner. To fulfill\nthis setting, there involves two challenges: (1) the action data for most users\nis scarce; (2) user preferences are dynamically evolving and shifting over\ntime. To tackle those issues, we propose a novel Retrieval-Enhanced Temporal\nEvent (RETE) forecasting framework. Unlike existing methods that enhance user\nrepresentations via roughly absorbing information from connected entities in\nthe whole graph, RETE efficiently and dynamically retrieves relevant entities\ncentrally on each user as high-quality subgraphs, preventing the noise\npropagation from the densely evolutionary graph structures that incorporate\nabundant search queries. And meanwhile, RETE autoregressively accumulates\nretrieval-enhanced user representations from each time step, to capture\nevolutionary patterns for joint query and product prediction. Empirically,\nextensive experiments on both the public benchmark and four real-world\nindustrial datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RETE method.",

However, the relative effectiveness of these SNA\nmetrics over code metrics in improving the performance of the SDP models has\nbeen widely debated with no clear consensus. Furthermore, some of the common\nSDP scenarios like predicting the number of defects in a module (Defect-count)\nin Cross-version and Cross-project SDP contexts remain unexplored. Such lack of\nclear directive on the effectiveness of SNA metrics when compared to the widely\nused code metrics prevents us from potentially building better performing SDP\nmodels. Therefore, through a case study of 9 open source software projects\nacross 30 versions, we study the relative effectiveness of SNA metrics when\ncompared to code metrics across 3 commonly used SDP contexts (Within-project,\nCross-version and Cross-project) and scenarios (Defect-count,\nDefect-classification (classifying if a module is defective) and Effort-aware\n(ranking the defective modules w.r.t to the involved effort)). We find the SNA\nmetrics by themselves or along with code metrics improve the performance of SDP\nmodels over just using code metrics on 5 out of the 9 studied SDP scenarios\n(three SDP scenarios across three SDP contexts). However, we note that in some\ncases the improvements afforded by considering SNA metrics over or alongside\ncode metrics might only be marginal, whereas in other cases the improvements\ncould be potentially large.

    "abstract": "Researchers usually discretize a continuous dependent variable into two\ntarget classes by introducing an artificial discretization threshold (e.g.,\nmedian). However, such discretization may introduce noise (i.e., discretization\nnoise) due to ambiguous class loyalty of data points that are close to the\nartificial threshold. Previous studies do not provide a clear directive on the\nimpact of discretization noise on the classifiers and how to handle such noise.\nIn this paper, we propose a framework to help researchers and practitioners\nsystematically estimate the impact of discretization noise on classifiers in\nterms of its impact on various performance measures and the interpretation of\nclassifiers. Through a case study of 7 software engineering datasets, we find\nthat: 1) discretization noise affects the different performance measures of a\nclassifier differently for different datasets; 2) Though the interpretation of\nthe classifiers are impacted by the discretization noise on the whole, the top\n3 most important features are not affected by the discretization noise.\nTherefore, we suggest that practitioners and researchers use our framework to\nunderstand the impact of discretization noise on the performance of their built\nclassifiers and estimate the exact amount of discretization noise to be\ndiscarded from the dataset to avoid the negative impact of such noise.",

Usually, users report issues that can be\ncategorized into different labels such as bug reports, enhancement requests,\nand questions related to the software. Most of the issue tracking systems make\nthe labelling of these issue reports optional for the issue submitter, which\nleads to a large number of unlabeled issue reports. In this paper, we present a\nstate-of-the-art method to classify the issue reports into their respective\ncategories i.e. bug, enhancement, and question. This is a challenging task\nbecause of the common use of informal language in the issue reports. Existing\nstudies use traditional natural language processing approaches adopting\nkey-word based features, which fail to incorporate the contextual relationship\nbetween words and therefore result in a high rate of false positives and false\nnegatives. Moreover, previous works utilize a uni-label approach to classify\nthe issue reports however, in reality, an issue-submitter can tag one issue\nreport with more than one label at a time. This paper presents our approach to\nclassify the issue reports in a multi-label setting. We use an off-the-shelf\nneural network called RoBERTa and fine-tune it to classify the issue reports.\nWe validate our approach on issue reports belonging to numerous industrial\nprojects from GitHub.

However, this discretization of\ncontinuous defect counts leads to information loss that might affect the\nperformance and interpretation of defect classifiers. Another possible approach\nto build defect classifiers is through the use of regression models then\ndiscretizing the predicted defect counts into defective and non-defective\nclasses (regression-based classifiers).\nIn this paper, we compare the performance and interpretation of defect\nclassifiers that are built using both approaches (i.e., discretized classifiers\nand regression-based classifiers) across six commonly used machine learning\nclassifiers (i.e., linear/logistic regression, random forest, KNN, SVM, CART,\nand neural networks) and 17 datasets. We find that: i) Random forest based\nclassifiers outperform other classifiers (best AUC) for both classifier\nbuilding approaches; ii) In contrast to common practice, building a defect\nclassifier using discretized defect counts (i.e., discretized classifiers) does\nnot always lead to better performance.\nHence we suggest that future defect classification studies should consider\nbuilding regression-based classifiers (in particular when the defective ratio\nof the modeled dataset is low). Moreover, we suggest that both approaches for\nbuilding defect classifiers should be explored, so the best-performing\nclassifier can be used when determining the most influential features.",

However,\nthere are still open challenges limiting its widespread use, especially when\ndealing with low-cost systems. Most solutions falls either into fully\nfunctioning commercial products with high costs, or ad-hoc solutions with lower\nperformance. Moreover, there are few datasets available, from which complete\nand general solutions can be derived.

It provides data for the analysis of the complete inertial pose\npipeline, from raw measurements, to sensor-to-segment calibration, multi-sensor\nfusion, skeleton kinematics, to the complete human pose. Multiple trials were\ncollected with 21 and 10 subjects respectively, performing 6 types of sequences\n(ranging from calibration, to daily-activities and random movements). It\npresents a high degree of variability and complex dynamics with almost complete\nrange-of-motion, while containing common sources of error found on real\nconditions.

    "abstract": "The task of ultra-fine entity typing (UFET) seeks to predict diverse and\nfree-form words or phrases that describe the appropriate types of entities\nmentioned in sentences. A key challenge for this task lies in the large amount\nof types and the scarcity of annotated data per type. Existing systems\nformulate the task as a multi-way classification problem and train directly or\ndistantly supervised classifiers. This causes two issues: (i) the classifiers\ndo not capture the type semantics since types are often converted into indices;\n(ii) systems developed in this way are limited to predicting within a\npre-defined type set, and often fall short of generalizing to types that are\nrarely seen or unseen in training. This work presents LITE, a new approach that\nformulates entity typing as a natural language inference (NLI) problem, making\nuse of (i) the indirect supervision from NLI to infer type information\nmeaningfully represented as textual hypotheses and alleviate the data scarcity\nissue, as well as (ii) a learning-to-rank objective to avoid the pre-defining\nof a type set. Experiments show that, with limited training data, LITE obtains\nstate-of-the-art performance on the UFET task.

    "abstract": "With the field of rigid-body robotics having matured in the last fifty years,\nrouting, planning, and manipulation of deformable objects have emerged in\nrecent years as a more untouched research area in many fields ranging from\nsurgical robotics to industrial assembly and construction. Routing approaches\nfor deformable objects which rely on learned implicit spatial representations\n(e.g., Learning-from-Demonstration methods) make them vulnerable to changes in\nthe environment and the specific setup. On the other hand, algorithms that\nentirely separate the spatial representation of the deformable object from the\nrouting and manipulation, often using a representation approach independent of\nplanning, result in slow planning in high dimensional space.\nThis paper proposes a novel approach to spatial representation combined with\nroute planning that allows efficient routing of deformable one-dimensional\nobjects (e.g., wires, cables, ropes, threads). The spatial representation is\nbased on the geometrical decomposition of the space into convex subspaces,\nwhich allows an efficient coding of the configuration. Having such a\nconfiguration, the routing problem can be solved using a dynamic programming\nmatching method with a quadratic time and space complexity. The proposed method\ncouples the routing and efficient configuration for improved planning time.

    "abstract": "Open-set domain adaptation (OSDA) has gained considerable attention in many\nvisual recognition tasks. However, most existing OSDA approaches are limited\ndue to three main reasons, including: (1) the lack of essential theoretical\nanalysis of generalization bound, (2) the reliance on the coexistence of source\nand target data during adaptation, and (3) failing to accurately estimate the\nuncertainty of model predictions. We propose a Progressive Graph Learning (PGL)\nframework that decomposes the target hypothesis space into the shared and\nunknown subspaces, and then progressively pseudo-labels the most confident\nknown samples from the target domain for hypothesis adaptation. Moreover, we\ntackle a more realistic source-free open-set domain adaptation (SF-OSDA)\nsetting that makes no assumption about the coexistence of source and target\ndomains, and introduce a balanced pseudo-labeling (BP-L) strategy in a\ntwo-stage framework, namely SF-PGL. Different from PGL that applies a\nclass-agnostic constant threshold for all target samples for pseudo-labeling,\nthe SF-PGL model uniformly selects the most confident target instances from\neach category at a fixed ratio. The confidence thresholds in each class are\nregarded as the 'uncertainty' of learning the semantic information, which are\nthen used to weigh the classification loss in the adaptation step. We conducted\nunsupervised and semi-supervised OSDA and SF-OSDA experiments on the benchmark\nimage classification and action recognition datasets. Additionally, we find\nthat balanced pseudo-labeling plays a significant role in improving\ncalibration, which makes the trained model less prone to over-confident or\nunder-confident predictions on the target data.

    "abstract": "In a federated learning system, the clients, e.g. mobile devices and\norganization participants, usually have different personal preferences or\nbehavior patterns, namely Non-IID data problems across clients. Clustered\nfederated learning is to group users into different clusters that the clients\nin the same group will share the same or similar behavior patterns that are to\nsatisfy the IID data assumption for most traditional machine learning\nalgorithms. Most of the existing clustering methods in FL treat every client\nequally that ignores the different importance contributions among clients. This\npaper proposes a novel weighted client-based clustered FL algorithm to leverage\nthe client's group and each client in a unified optimization framework.\nMoreover, the paper proposes convergence analysis to the proposed clustered FL\nmethod. The experimental analysis has demonstrated the effectiveness of the\nproposed method.",

    "abstract": "Age of Information (AoI), which measures the time elapsed since the\ngeneration of the last received packet at the destination, is a new metric for\nreal-time status update tracking applications. In this paper, we consider a\nstatus-update system in which a source node samples updates and sends them to\nan edge server over a delay channel. The received updates are processed by the\nserver with an infinite buffer and then delivered to a destination. The channel\ncan send only one update at a time, and the server can process one at a time as\nwell. The source node applies generate-at-will model according to the state of\nthe channel, the edge server, and the buffer. We aim to minimize the average\nAoI with \\emph{independent and identically distributed} transmission time and\nprocessing time. We consider three online scheduling policies. The first one is\nthe optimal long wait policy, under which the source node only transmits a new\npacket after the old one is delivered. Secondly, we propose a peak age\nthreshold policy, under which the source node determines the sending time based\non the estimated peak age of information (PAoI). Finally, we improve the peak\nage threshold policy by considering a postponed plan to reduce the waiting time\nin the buffer. The AoI performance under these policies is illustrated by\nnumerical results with different parameters.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the parameter space of machine learning (ML)\nalgorithms in aggravating or mitigating fairness bugs. Data-driven software is\nincreasingly applied in social-critical applications where ensuring fairness is\nof paramount importance. The existing approaches focus on addressing fairness\nbugs by either modifying the input dataset or modifying the learning\nalgorithms. On the other hand, the selection of hyperparameters, which provide\nfiner controls of ML algorithms, may enable a less intrusive approach to\ninfluence the fairness. Can hyperparameters amplify or suppress discrimination\npresent in the input dataset? How can we help programmers in detecting,\nunderstanding, and exploiting the role of hyperparameters to improve the\nfairness?\nWe design three search-based software testing algorithms to uncover the\nprecision-fairness frontier of the hyperparameter space. We complement these\nalgorithms with statistical debugging to explain the role of these parameters\nin improving fairness. We implement the proposed approaches in the tool\nParfait-ML (PARameter FAIrness Testing for ML Libraries) and show its\neffectiveness and utility over five mature ML algorithms as used in six\nsocial-critical applications. In these applications, our approach successfully\nidentified hyperparameters that significantly improve (vis-a-vis the\nstate-of-the-art techniques) the fairness without sacrificing precision.\nSurprisingly, for some algorithms (e.g., random forest), our approach showed\nthat certain configuration of hyperparameters (e.g., restricting the search\nspace of attributes) can amplify biases across applications.

    "title": "Improving Graph Collaborative Filtering with Neighborhood-enriched  Contrastive Learning",
    "abstract": "Recently, graph collaborative filtering methods have been proposed as an\neffective recommendation approach, which can capture users' preference over\nitems by modeling the user-item interaction graphs. In order to reduce the\ninfluence of data sparsity, contrastive learning is adopted in graph\ncollaborative filtering for enhancing the performance. However, these methods\ntypically construct the contrastive pairs by random sampling, which neglect the\nneighboring relations among users (or items) and fail to fully exploit the\npotential of contrastive learning for recommendation. To tackle the above\nissue, we propose a novel contrastive learning approach, named\nNeighborhood-enriched Contrastive Learning, named NCL, which explicitly\nincorporates the potential neighbors into contrastive pairs. Specifically, we\nintroduce the neighbors of a user (or an item) from graph structure and\nsemantic space respectively. For the structural neighbors on the interaction\ngraph, we develop a novel structure-contrastive objective that regards users\n(or items) and their structural neighbors as positive contrastive pairs. In\nimplementation, the representations of users (or items) and neighbors\ncorrespond to the outputs of different GNN layers. Furthermore, to excavate the\npotential neighbor relation in semantic space, we assume that users with\nsimilar representations are within the semantic neighborhood, and incorporate\nthese semantic neighbors into the prototype-contrastive objective. The proposed\nNCL can be optimized with EM algorithm and generalized to apply to graph\ncollaborative filtering methods. Extensive experiments on five public datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed NCL, notably with 26% and 17%\nperformance gain over a competitive graph collaborative filtering base model on\nthe Yelp and Amazon-book datasets respectively.

However, EBR in sponsored search is distinguished from other\ngeneric scenarios and technically challenging due to the need of serving\nmultiple retrieval purposes: firstly, it has to retrieve high-relevance ads,\nwhich may exactly serve user's search intent; secondly, it needs to retrieve\nhigh-CTR ads so as to maximize the overall user clicks. In this paper, we\npresent a novel representation learning framework Uni-Retriever developed for\nBing Search, which unifies two different training modes knowledge distillation\nand contrastive learning to realize both required objectives. On one hand, the\ncapability of making high-relevance retrieval is established by distilling\nknowledge from the ``relevance teacher model''. On the other hand, the\ncapability of making high-CTR retrieval is optimized by learning to\ndiscriminate user's clicked ads from the entire corpus. The two training modes\nare jointly performed as a multi-objective learning process, such that the ads\nof high relevance and CTR can be favored by the generated embeddings. Besides\nthe learning strategy, we also elaborate our solution for EBR serving pipeline\nbuilt upon the substantially optimized DiskANN, where massive-scale EBR can be\nperformed with competitive time and memory efficiency, and accomplished in\nhigh-quality. We make comprehensive offline and online experiments to evaluate\nthe proposed techniques, whose findings may provide useful insights for the\nfuture development of EBR systems.

    "abstract": "In recent years, monitoring hate speech and offensive language on social\nmedia platforms has become paramount due to its widespread usage among all age\ngroups, races, and ethnicities. Consequently, there have been substantial\nresearch efforts towards automated detection of such content using Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP). While successfully filtering textual data, no\nresearch has focused on detecting hateful content in multimedia data. With\nincreased ease of data storage and the exponential growth of social media\nplatforms, multimedia content proliferates the internet as much as text data.\nNevertheless, it escapes the automatic filtering systems. Hate speech and\noffensiveness can be detected in multimedia primarily via three modalities,\ni.e., visual, acoustic, and verbal. Our preliminary study concluded that the\nmost essential features in classifying hate speech would be the speaker's\nemotional state and its influence on the spoken words, therefore limiting our\ncurrent research to these modalities. This paper proposes the first multimodal\ndeep learning framework to combine the auditory features representing emotion\nand the semantic features to detect hateful content. Our results demonstrate\nthat incorporating emotional attributes leads to significant improvement over\ntext-based models in detecting hateful multimedia content.

Building a model to\npredict photovoltaic (PV) power generation allows decision-makers to hedge\nenergy shortages and further design proper operations. The solar power output\nis time-series data dependent on many factors, such as irradiance and weather.\nA machine learning framework for 1-hour ahead solar power prediction is\ndeveloped in this paper based on the historical data. Our method extends the\ninput dataset into higher dimensional Chebyshev polynomial space. Then, a\nfeature selection scheme is developed with constrained linear regression to\nconstruct the predictor for different weather types. Several tests show that\nthe proposed approach yields lower mean squared error than classical machine\nlearning methods, such as support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and\ngradient boosting decision tree (GBDT).",

    "abstract": "Vital node identification is the problem of finding nodes of highest\nimportance in complex networks. This problem has crucial applications in\nvarious contexts such as viral marketing or controlling the propagation of\nvirus or rumours in real-world networks. Existing approaches for vital node\nidentification mainly focus on capturing the importance of a node through a\nmathematical expression which directly relates structural properties of the\nnode to its vitality. Although these heuristic approaches have achieved good\nperformance in practice, they have weak adaptability, and their performance is\nlimited to specific settings and certain dynamics. Inspired by the power of\nmachine learning models for efficiently capturing different types of patterns\nand relations, we propose a machine learning-based, data driven approach for\nvital node identification. The main idea is to train the model with a small\nportion of the graph, say 0.5% of the nodes, and do the prediction on the rest\nof the nodes. The ground-truth vitality for the train data is computed by\nsimulating the SIR diffusion method starting from the train nodes. We use\ncollective feature engineering where each node in the network is represented by\nincorporating elements of its connectivity, degree and extended coreness.\nSeveral machine learning models are trained on the node representations, but\nthe best results are achieved by a Support Vector Regression machine with RBF\nkernel. The empirical results confirms that the proposed model outperforms\nstate-of-the-art models on a selection of datasets, while it also shows more\nadaptability to changes in the dynamics parameters.",

    "abstract": "Policy constraint methods to offline reinforcement learning (RL) typically\nutilize parameterization or regularization that constrains the policy to\nperform actions within the support set of the behavior policy. The elaborative\ndesigns of parameterization methods usually intrude into the policy networks,\nwhich may bring extra inference cost and cannot take full advantage of\nwell-established online methods. Regularization methods reduce the divergence\nbetween the learned policy and the behavior policy, which may mismatch the\ninherent density-based definition of support set thereby failing to avoid the\nout-of-distribution actions effectively. This paper presents Supported Policy\nOpTimization (SPOT), which is directly derived from the theoretical\nformalization of the density-based support constraint. SPOT adopts a VAE-based\ndensity estimator to explicitly model the support set of behavior policy and\npresents a simple but effective density-based regularization term, which can be\nplugged non-intrusively into off-the-shelf off-policy RL algorithms. On the\nstandard benchmarks for offline RL, SPOT substantially outperforms\nstate-of-the-art offline RL methods.

    "abstract": "Autonomous modeling of artificial swarms is necessary because manual creation\nis a time intensive and complicated procedure which makes it impractical. An\nautonomous approach employing deep reinforcement learning is presented in this\nstudy for swarm navigation. In this approach, complex 3D environments with\nstatic and dynamic obstacles and resistive forces (like linear drag, angular\ndrag, and gravity) are modeled to track multiple dynamic targets. Moreover,\nreward functions for robust swarm formation and target tracking are devised for\nlearning complex swarm behaviors. Since the number of agents is not fixed and\nhas only the partial observance of the environment, swarm formation and\nnavigation become challenging. In this regard, the proposed strategy consists\nof three main phases to tackle the aforementioned challenges: 1) A methodology\nfor dynamic swarm management, 2) Avoiding obstacles, Finding the shortest path\ntowards the targets, 3) Tracking the targets and Island modeling. The dynamic\nswarm management phase translates basic sensory input to high level commands to\nenhance swarm navigation and decentralized setup while maintaining the swarms\nsize fluctuations. While, in the island modeling, the swarm can split into\nindividual subswarms according to the number of targets, conversely, these\nsubswarms may join to form a single huge swarm, giving the swarm ability to\ntrack multiple targets. Customized state of the art policy based deep\nreinforcement learning algorithms are employed to achieve significant results.\nThe promising results show that our proposed strategy enhances swarm navigation\nand can track multiple static and dynamic targets in complex dynamic\nenvironments.",

However, the attention mechanism has a quadratic\ncomplexity, significantly impeding Transformers from dealing with numerous\ntokens and scaling up to bigger models. Previous methods mainly utilize the\nsimilarity decomposition and the associativity of matrix multiplication to\ndevise linear-time attention mechanisms. They avoid degeneration of attention\nto a trivial distribution by reintroducing inductive biases such as the\nlocality, thereby at the expense of model generality and expressiveness. In\nthis paper, we linearize Transformers free from specific inductive biases based\non the flow network theory. We cast attention as the information flow\naggregated from the sources (values) to the sinks (results) through the learned\nflow capacities (attentions). Within this framework, we apply the property of\nflow conservation with attention and propose the Flow-Attention mechanism of\nlinear complexity. By respectively conserving the incoming flow of sinks for\nsource competition and the outgoing flow of sources for sink allocation,\nFlow-Attention inherently generates informative attentions without using\nspecific inductive biases.

The\ncurrent best approximation ratio is 4.675 for this problem with 1-fair\nviolation, which was proposed by Bercea et al. [APPROX-RANDOM'2019]. As far as\nwe know, there is no available approximation algorithm for the problem without\nany fair violation. In this paper, we consider the fair $k$-median problem in\nbounded doubling metrics and general metrics. We provide the first QPTAS for\nfair $k$-median problem in doubling metrics. Based on the split-tree\ndecomposition of doubling metrics, we present a dynamic programming process to\nfind the candidate centers, and apply min-cost max-flow method to deal with the\nassignment of clients. Especially, for overcoming the difficulties caused by\nthe fair constraints, we construct an auxiliary graph and use minimum weighted\nperfect matching to get part of the cost. For the fair $k$-median problem in\ngeneral metrics, we present an approximation algorithm with ratio $O(\\log k)$,\nwhich is based on the embedding of given space into tree metrics, and the\ndynamic programming method. Our two approximation algorithms for the fair\n$k$-median problem are the first results for the corresponding problems without\nany fair violation, respectively.",

The broad attention is implemented by broad\nconnection and parameter-free attention. Broad connection of each transformer\nlayer promotes the transmission and integration of information for BViT.\nWithout introducing additional trainable parameters, parameter-free attention\njointly focuses on the already available attention information in different\nlayers for extracting useful information and building their relationship.\nExperiments on image classification tasks demonstrate that BViT delivers\nstate-of-the-art accuracy of 74.8\\%/81.6\\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with\n5M/22M parameters. Moreover, we transfer BViT to downstream object recognition\nbenchmarks to achieve 98.9\\% and 89.9\\% on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 respectively\nthat exceed ViT with fewer parameters.

    "abstract": "Learners are often introduced to programming via dedicated languages such as\nScratch, where block-based commands are assembled visually in order to control\nthe interactions of graphical sprites. Automated testing of such programs is an\nimportant prerequisite for supporting debugging, providing hints, or assessing\nlearning outcomes. However, writing tests for Scratch programs can be\nchallenging: The game-like and randomised nature of typical Scratch programs\nmakes it difficult to identify specific timed input sequences used to control\nthe programs. Furthermore, precise test assertions to check the resulting\nprogram states are incompatible with the fundamental principle of creative\nfreedom in programming in Scratch, where correct program behaviour may be\nimplemented with deviations in the graphical appearance or timing of the\nprogram. The event-driven and actor-oriented nature of Scratch programs,\nhowever, makes them a natural fit for describing program behaviour using finite\nstate machines. In this paper, we introduce a model-based testing approach by\nextending Whisker, an automated testing framework for Scratch programs. The\nmodel-based extension describes expected program behaviour in terms of state\nmachines, which makes it feasible to check the abstract behaviour of a program\nindependent of exact timing and pixel-precise graphical details, and to\nautomatically derive test inputs testing even challenging programs.

    "abstract": "Dynamic occupancy maps were proposed in recent years to model the obstacles\nin dynamic environments. Among these maps, the particle-based map offers a\nsolid theoretical basis and the ability to model complex-shaped obstacles.\nCurrent particle-based maps describe the occupancy status in discrete grid form\nand suffer from the grid size problem, namely: large grid size is unfavorable\nfor path planning while small grid size lowers efficiency and causes gaps and\ninconsistencies. To tackle this problem, this paper generalizes the\nparticle-based map into continuous space and builds an efficient 3D local map.\nA dual-structure subspace division paradigm, composed of a voxel subspace\ndivision and a novel pyramid-like subspace division, is proposed to propagate\nparticles and update the map efficiently with the consideration of occlusions.\nThe occupancy status of an arbitrary point can then be estimated with the\ncardinality expectation. To reduce the noise in modeling static and dynamic\nobstacles simultaneously, an initial velocity estimation approach and a mixture\nmodel are utilized. Experimental results show that our map can effectively and\nefficiently model both dynamic obstacles and static obstacles. Compared to the\nstate-of-the-art grid-form particle-based map, our map enables continuous\noccupancy estimation and substantially improves the performance in different\nresolutions. We also deployed the map on a quadrotor to demonstrate the bright\nprospect of using this map in obstacle avoidance tasks of small-scale robotics\nsystems.",

While the block-based\nnature of Scratch helps learners by preventing syntactical mistakes, there\nnevertheless remains a need to provide feedback and support in order to\nimplement desired functionality. To support individual learning and classroom\nsettings, this feedback and support should ideally be provided in an automated\nfashion, which requires tests to enable dynamic program analysis. The Whisker\nframework enables automated testing of Scratch programs, but creating these\nautomated tests for Scratch programs is challenging. In this paper, we\ntherefore investigate how to automatically generate Whisker tests. This raises\nimportant challenges: First, game-like programs are typically randomised,\nleading to flaky tests. Second, Scratch programs usually consist of animations\nand interactions with long delays, inhibiting the application of classical test\ngeneration approaches. Evaluation on common programming exercises, a random\nsample of 1000 Scratch user programs, and the 1000 most popular Scratch\nprograms demonstrates that our approach enables Whisker to reliably accelerate\ntest executions, and even though many Scratch programs are small and easy to\ncover, there are many unique challenges for which advanced search-based test\ngeneration using many-objective algorithms is needed in order to achieve high\ncoverage.",

A two-scale representation is adopted, where 3D continuum\nelements at the structural scale are linked to embedded nonlinear interfaces\nrepresenting the meso-structure of the material. The potential and accuracy of\nthe proposed approach are shown in numerical examples and comparisons against\nphysical experiments on masonry arches and bridges under static and dynamic\nloading.",

To approximately solve the\nconfiguration LP, we design an approximate separation oracle for its dual\nprogram. In particular, the separation oracle can be reduced to the norm\nminimization with a linear constraint (NormLin) problem and we devise a\npolynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) for it, which may be of independent\ninterest.",

It has been pointed out that such activities may\nincrease motion sickness. Many studies have been conducted to build\ncountermeasures, of which various computational motion sickness models have\nbeen developed. Many of these are based on subjective vertical conflict (SVC)\ntheory, which describes vertical changes in direction sensed by human sensory\norgans vs. those expected by the central nervous system. Such models are\nexpected to be applied to autonomous driving scenarios. However, no current\ncomputational model can integrate visual vertical information with vestibular\nsensations.\nWe proposed a 6 DoF SVC-VV model which add a visually perceived vertical\nblock into a conventional six-degrees-of-freedom SVC model to predict VV\ndirections from image data simulating the visual input of a human. Hence, a\nsimple image-based VV estimation method is proposed.\nAs the validation of the proposed model, this paper focuses on describing the\nfact that the motion sickness increases as a passenger reads a book while using\nan AMPV, assuming that visual vertical (VV) plays an important role. In the\nstatic experiment, it is demonstrated that the estimated VV by the proposed\nmethod accurately described the gravitational acceleration direction with a low\nmean absolute deviation. In addition, the results of the driving experiment\nusing an APMV demonstrated that the proposed 6 DoF SVC-VV model could describe\nthat the increased motion sickness experienced when the VV and gravitational\nacceleration directions were different.",

However,\nthis is a notoriously ill-posed problem, especially for indoor scenarios,\nbecause of the complexity of indoor luminaires and the limited information\ninvolved in 2D images. In this paper, we propose a graph learning-based\nframework for indoor lighting estimation. At its core is a new lighting model\n(dubbed DSGLight) based on depth-augmented Spherical Gaussians (SG) and a Graph\nConvolutional Network (GCN) that infers the new lighting representation from a\nsingle LDR image of limited field-of-view. Our lighting model builds 128 evenly\ndistributed SGs over the indoor panorama, where each SG encoding the lighting\nand the depth around that node. The proposed GCN then learns the mapping from\nthe input image to DSGLight. Compared with existing lighting models, our\nDSGLight encodes both direct lighting and indirect environmental lighting more\nfaithfully and compactly. It also makes network training and inference more\nstable. The estimated depth distribution enables temporally stable shading and\nshadows under spatially-varying lighting.

The objective of network embedding is\nto represent network nodes in a low-dimensional vector space while retaining as\nmuch information as possible from the original network including structural,\nrelational, and semantic information. However, asymmetric nature of directed\nnetworks poses many challenges as how to best preserve edge directions in the\nembedding process. Here, we propose a novel deep asymmetric attributed network\nembedding model based on convolutional graph neural network, called AAGCN. The\nmain idea is to maximally preserve the asymmetric proximity and asymmetric\nsimilarity of directed attributed networks. AAGCN introduces two neighbourhood\nfeature aggregation schemes to separately aggregate the features of a node with\nthe features of its in- and out- neighbours. Then, it learns two embedding\nvectors for each node, one source embedding vector and one target embedding\nvector. The final representations are the results of concatenating source and\ntarget embedding vectors. We test the performance of AAGCN on three real-world\nnetworks for network reconstruction, link prediction, node classification and\nvisualization tasks.

    "title": "Learning to Rank from Relevance Judgments Distributions",
    "abstract": "Learning to Rank (LETOR) algorithms are usually trained on annotated corpora\nwhere a single relevance label is assigned to each available document-topic\npair. Within the Cranfield framework, relevance labels result from merging\neither multiple expertly curated or crowdsourced human assessments. In this\npaper, we explore how to train LETOR models with relevance judgments\ndistributions (either real or synthetically generated) assigned to\ndocument-topic pairs instead of single-valued relevance labels. We propose five\nnew probabilistic loss functions to deal with the higher expressive power\nprovided by relevance judgments distributions and show how they can be applied\nboth to neural and GBM architectures. Moreover, we show how training a LETOR\nmodel on a sampled version of the relevance judgments from certain probability\ndistributions can improve its performance when relying either on traditional or\nprobabilistic loss functions. Finally, we validate our hypothesis on real-world\ncrowdsourced relevance judgments distributions. Overall, we observe that\nrelying on relevance judgments distributions to train different LETOR models\ncan boost their performance and even outperform strong baselines such as\nLambdaMART on several test collections.",

In particular, a reinforcement learning\nframework is constructed with appropriate reward design so that the optimal\npolicy maximizes the Lagrangian of the primal problem, where the maximizer of\nthe Lagrangian is shown to have several good properties. For the model-based\ncase, a fast converging algorithm is proposed to find the optimal Lagrange\nmultiplier and thus the corresponding optimal policy. For the model-free case,\nwe develop a three-stage strategy, composed in order of online sampling,\noffline learning, and online operation, where a backward Q-learning with full\nexploitation of sampled channel realizations is designed to accelerate the\nlearning process. According to our simulation, the proposed reinforcement\nlearning framework can solve the primal optimization problem from the dual\nperspective.

    "abstract": "Most approaches for goal recognition rely on specifications of the possible\ndynamics of the actor in the environment when pursuing a goal. These\nspecifications suffer from two key issues. First, encoding these dynamics\nrequires careful design by a domain expert, which is often not robust to noise\nat recognition time. Second, existing approaches often need costly real-time\ncomputations to reason about the likelihood of each potential goal. In this\npaper, we develop a framework that combines model-free reinforcement learning\nand goal recognition to alleviate the need for careful, manual domain design,\nand the need for costly online executions. This framework consists of two main\nstages: Offline learning of policies or utility functions for each potential\ngoal, and online inference. We provide a first instance of this framework using\ntabular Q-learning for the learning stage, as well as three measures that can\nbe used to perform the inference stage. The resulting instantiation achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance against goal recognizers on standard evaluation\ndomains and superior performance in noisy environments.",

The ADMM algorithm is experimentally shown to have\nnearly linear time complexity and fast iteration times, allowing it to simulate\nmuch larger problems than were previously feasible. The effectiveness, as well\nas the insensitivity of the algorithm to its numerical parameters is\ndemonstrated through examples.

    "title": "Unsourced Multiple Access With Random User Activity",
    "abstract": "To account for the massive uncoordinated random access scenario, which is\nrelevant for the Internet of Things, Polyanskiy (2017) proposed a novel\nformulation of the multiple-access problem, commonly referred to as unsourced\nmultiple access, where all users employ a common codebook and the receiver\ndecodes up to a permutation of the messages. We extend this seminal work to the\ncase where the number of active users is random and unknown a priori. We define\na random-access code accounting for both misdetection (MD) and false alarm\n(FA), and derive a random-coding achievability bound for the Gaussian multiple\naccess channel. Our bound captures the fundamental trade-off between MD and FA.\nIt suggests that the lack of knowledge of the number of active users entails a\nsmall penalty in energy efficiency when the target MD and FA probabilities are\nhigh. However, as the target MD and FA probabilities decrease, the energy\nefficiency penalty becomes significant. For example, in a typical IoT scenario,\nthe required energy per bit to achieve both MD and FA probabilities below 0.1,\npredicted by our bound, is only 0.5-0.7 dB higher than that predicted by the\nbound in Polyanskiy (2017) for a known number of active users. This gap\nincreases to 3-4 dB when the target MD and/or FA probability is 0.001. Taking\nboth MD and FA into account, we use our bound to benchmark the energy\nefficiency of slotted ALOHA with multi-packet reception, of a decoder that\ntreats interference as noise, and of some recently proposed coding schemes.\nNumerical results suggest that, when the target MD and FA probabilities are\nhigh, it is effective to estimate the number of active users, then treat this\nestimate as the true value, and use a coding scheme that performs well for the\ncase of known number of active users. However, this approach becomes energy\ninefficient when the requirements on MD and FA probabilities are stringent.",

This\nextractable value takes the form of monetizable opportunities that allow\nblockchain participants to extract money from a DEX without adding demand or\nliquidity to the DEX, the two functions for which DEXs are intended. This money\nis taken directly from the intended DEX participants. As a result, the cost of\nparticipation in existing DEXs is much larger than the upfront fees required to\npost a transaction on a blockchain and/or into a smart contract.\nWe present FairTraDEX, a decentralised variant of a frequent batch auction\n(FBA), a DEX protocol which provides formal game-theoretic guarantees against\nextractable value. FBAs when run by a trusted third-party provide unique\ngame-theoretic optimal strategies which ensure players are shown prices equal\nto the liquidity provider's fair price, excluding explicit, pre-determined\nfees. FairTraDEX replicates the key features of an FBA that provide these\ngame-theoretic guarantees using a combination of set-membership in\nzero-knowledge protocols and an escrow-enforced commit-reveal protocol. We\nextend the results of FBAs to handle monopolistic and/or malicious liquidity\nproviders, and provide a detailed pseudo-code implementation of FairTraDEX\nbased on existing mainstream blockchain protocols.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of reinforcement learning (RL) with low (policy)\nswitching cost - a problem well-motivated by real-life RL applications in which\ndeployments of new policies are costly and the number of policy updates must be\nlow. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm based on stage-wise exploration\nand adaptive policy elimination that achieves a regret of\n$\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{H^4S^2AT})$ while requiring a switching cost of $O(HSA\n\\log\\log T)$. This is an exponential improvement over the best-known switching\ncost $O(H^2SA\\log T)$ among existing methods with\n$\\widetilde{O}(\\mathrm{poly}(H,S,A)\\sqrt{T})$ regret. In the above, $S,A$\ndenotes the number of states and actions in an $H$-horizon episodic Markov\nDecision Process model with unknown transitions, and $T$ is the number of\nsteps. We also prove an information-theoretical lower bound which says that a\nswitching cost of $\\Omega(HSA)$ is required for any no-regret algorithm. As a\nbyproduct, our new algorithmic techniques allow us to derive a\n\\emph{reward-free} exploration algorithm with an optimal switching cost of\n$O(HSA)$.",

We find that scaling laws\nemerge at finetuning time in some NLP tasks, and that they can also be\nexploited for debugging convergence when training large models. Moreover, for\ntasks where scaling laws exist, they can be used to predict the performance of\nlarger models, which enables effective model selection.

    "abstract": "Many applications, such as system identification, classification of time\nseries, direct and inverse problems in partial differential equations, and\nuncertainty quantification lead to the question of approximation of a\nnon-linear operator between metric spaces $\\mathfrak{X}$ and $\\mathfrak{Y}$. We\nstudy the problem of determining the degree of approximation of a such\noperators on a compact subset $K_\\mathfrak{X}\\subset \\mathfrak{X}$ using a\nfinite amount of information. If $\\mathcal{F}: K_\\mathfrak{X}\\to\nK_\\mathfrak{Y}$, a well established strategy to approximate $\\mathcal{F}(F)$\nfor some $F\\in K_\\mathfrak{X}$ is to encode $F$ (respectively,\n$\\mathcal{F}(F)$) in terms of a finite number $d$ (repectively $m$) of real\nnumbers. Together with appropriate reconstruction algorithms (decoders), the\nproblem reduces to the approximation of $m$ functions on a compact subset of a\nhigh dimensional Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^d$, equivalently, the unit sphere\n$\\mathbb{S}^d$ embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$. The problem is challenging\nbecause $d$, $m$, as well as the complexity of the approximation on\n$\\mathbb{S}^d$ are all large, and it is necessary to estimate the accuracy\nkeeping track of the inter-dependence of all the approximations involved. In\nthis paper, we establish constructive methods to do this efficiently; i.e.,\nwith the constants involved in the estimates on the approximation on\n$\\\\mathbb{S}^d$ being $\\mathcal{O}(d^{1/6})$. We study different smoothness\nclasses for the operators, and also propose a method for approximation of\n$\\mathcal{F}(F)$ using only information in a small neighborhood of $F$,\nresulting in an effective reduction in the number of parameters involved. To\nfurther mitigate the problem of large number of parameters, we propose\nprefabricated networks, resulting in a substantially smaller number of\neffective parameters.",

    "abstract": "The recent mean field game (MFG) formalism has enabled the application of\ninverse reinforcement learning (IRL) methods in large-scale multi-agent\nsystems, with the goal of inferring reward signals that can explain\ndemonstrated behaviours of large populations. The existing IRL methods for MFGs\nare built upon reducing an MFG to a Markov decision process (MDP) defined on\nthe collective behaviours and average rewards of the population. However, this\npaper reveals that the reduction from MFG to MDP holds only for the fully\ncooperative setting. This limitation invalidates existing IRL methods on MFGs\nwith non-cooperative environments. To measure more general behaviours in large\npopulations, we study the use of individual behaviours to infer ground-truth\nreward functions for MFGs. We propose Mean Field IRL (MFIRL), the first\ndedicated IRL framework for MFGs that can handle both cooperative and\nnon-cooperative environments. Based on this theoretically justified framework,\nwe develop a practical algorithm effective for MFGs with unknown dynamics. We\nevaluate MFIRL on both cooperative and mixed cooperative-competitive scenarios\nwith many agents.

    "title": "Visual Sound Localization in the Wild by Cross-Modal Interference  Erasing",
    "abstract": "The task of audio-visual sound source localization has been well studied\nunder constrained scenes, where the audio recordings are clean. However, in\nreal-world scenarios, audios are usually contaminated by off-screen sound and\nbackground noise. They will interfere with the procedure of identifying desired\nsources and building visual-sound connections, making previous studies\nnon-applicable. In this work, we propose the Interference Eraser (IEr)\nframework, which tackles the problem of audio-visual sound source localization\nin the wild. The key idea is to eliminate the interference by redefining and\ncarving discriminative audio representations. Specifically, we observe that the\nprevious practice of learning only a single audio representation is\ninsufficient due to the additive nature of audio signals. We thus extend the\naudio representation with our Audio-Instance-Identifier module, which clearly\ndistinguishes sounding instances when audio signals of different volumes are\nunevenly mixed. Then we erase the influence of the audible but off-screen\nsounds and the silent but visible objects by a Cross-modal Referrer module with\ncross-modality distillation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations\ndemonstrate that our proposed framework achieves superior results on sound\nlocalization tasks, especially under real-world scenarios.

    "title": "Perception-Aware Perching on Powerlines with Multirotors",
    "abstract": "Multirotor aerial robots are becoming widely used for the inspection of\npowerlines. To enable continuous, robust inspection without human intervention,\nthe robots must be able to perch on the powerlines to recharge their batteries.\nHighly versatile perching capabilities are necessary to adapt to the variety of\nconfigurations and constraints that are present in real powerline systems. This\npaper presents a novel perching trajectory generation framework that computes\nperception-aware, collision-free, and dynamically-feasible maneuvers to guide\nthe robot to the desired final state. Trajectory generation is achieved via\nsolving a Nonlinear Programming problem using the Primal-Dual Interior Point\nmethod. The problem considers the full dynamic model of the robot down to its\nsingle rotor thrusts and minimizes the final pose and velocity errors while\navoiding collisions and maximizing the visibility of the powerline during the\nmaneuver. The generated maneuvers consider both the perching and the posterior\nrecovery trajectories. The framework adopts costs and constraints defined by\nefficient mathematical representations of powerlines, enabling online onboard\nexecution in resource-constrained hardware. The method is validated on-board an\nagile quadrotor conducting powerline inspection and various perching maneuvers\nwith final pitch values of up to 180 degrees.

    "abstract": "Radio access network (RAN) slicing is a key technology that enables 5G\nnetwork to support heterogeneous requirements of generic services, namely\nultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) and enhanced mobile broadband\n(eMBB). In this paper, we propose a two time-scales RAN slicing mechanism to\noptimize the performance of URLLC and eMBB services. In a large time-scale, an\nSDN controller allocates radio resources to gNodeBs according to the\nrequirements of the eMBB and URLLC services. In a short time-scale, each gNodeB\nallocates its available resources to its end-users and requests, if needed,\nadditional resources from adjacent gNodeBs. We formulate this problem as a\nnon-linear binary program and prove its NP-hardness. Next, for each time-scale,\nwe model the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), where the large-time\nscale is modeled as a single agent MDP whereas the shorter time-scale is\nmodeled as a multi-agent MDP. We leverage the exponential-weight algorithm for\nexploration and exploitation (EXP3) to solve the single-agent MDP of the large\ntime-scale MDP and the multi-agent deep Q-learning (DQL) algorithm to solve the\nmulti-agent MDP of the short time-scale resource allocation.

With network slicing,\ncommunication service providers seek to meet all the requirements imposed by\nthe verticals, including ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC)\nservices.

    "abstract": "To overcome the high path-loss and the intense shadowing in millimeter-wave\n(mmWave) communications, effective beamforming schemes are required which\nincorporate narrow beams with high beamforming gains. The mmWave channel\nconsists of a few spatial clusters each associated with an angle of departure\n(AoD). The narrow beams must be aligned with the channel AoDs to increase the\nbeamforming gain. This is achieved through a procedure called beam alignment\n(BA). Most of the BA schemes in the literature consider channels with a single\ndominant path while in practice the channel has a few resolvable paths with\ndifferent AoDs, hence, such BA schemes may not work correctly in the presence\nof multi-path or at the least do not exploit such multipath to achieve\ndiversity or increase robustness.\nIn this paper, we propose an efficient BA scheme in presence of multi-path.\nThe proposed BA scheme transmits probing packets using a set of scanning beams\nand receives feedback for all the scanning beams at the end of the probing\nphase from each user. We formulate the BA scheme as minimizing the expected\nvalue of the average transmission beamwidth under different policies. The\npolicy is defined as a function from the set of received feedback to the set of\ntransmission beams (TB).

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning (CL), a self-supervised learning approach, can\neffectively learn visual representations from unlabeled data. However, CL\nrequires learning on vast quantities of diverse data to achieve good\nperformance, without which the performance of CL will greatly degrade. To\ntackle this problem, we propose a framework with two approaches to improve the\ndata efficiency of CL training by generating beneficial samples and joint\nlearning. The first approach generates hard samples for the main model. The\ngenerator is jointly learned with the main model to dynamically customize hard\nsamples based on the training state of the main model. With the progressively\ngrowing knowledge of the main model, the generated samples also become harder\nto constantly encourage the main model to learn better representations.\nBesides, a pair of data generators are proposed to generate similar but\ndistinct samples as positive pairs. In joint learning, the hardness of a\npositive pair is progressively increased by decreasing their similarity. In\nthis way, the main model learns to cluster hard positives by pulling the\nrepresentations of similar yet distinct samples together, by which the\nrepresentations of similar samples are well-clustered and better\nrepresentations can be learned. Comprehensive experiments show superior\naccuracy and data efficiency of the proposed methods over the state-of-the-art\non multiple datasets. For example, about 5% accuracy improvement on\nImageNet-100 and CIFAR-10, and more than 6% accuracy improvement on CIFAR-100\nare achieved for linear classification.

    "title": "Asymptotically Unbiased Estimation for Delayed Feedback Modeling via  Label Correction",
    "abstract": "Alleviating the delayed feedback problem is of crucial importance for the\nconversion rate(CVR) prediction in online advertising. Previous delayed\nfeedback modeling methods using an observation window to balance the trade-off\nbetween waiting for accurate labels and consuming fresh feedback. Moreover, to\nestimate CVR upon the freshly observed but biased distribution with fake\nnegatives, the importance sampling is widely used to reduce the distribution\nbias. While effective, we argue that previous approaches falsely treat fake\nnegative samples as real negative during the importance weighting and have not\nfully utilized the observed positive samples, leading to suboptimal\nperformance.\nIn this work, we propose a new method, DElayed Feedback modeling with\nUnbiaSed Estimation, (DEFUSE), which aim to respectively correct the importance\nweights of the immediate positive, the fake negative, the real negative, and\nthe delay positive samples at finer granularity. Specifically, we propose a\ntwo-step optimization approach that first infers the probability of fake\nnegatives among observed negatives before applying importance sampling. To\nfully exploit the ground-truth immediate positives from the observed\ndistribution, we further develop a bi-distribution modeling framework to\njointly model the unbiased immediate positives and the biased delay\nconversions. Experimental results on both public and our industrial datasets\nvalidate the superiority of DEFUSE. Codes are available at\nhttps://github.com/ychen216/DEFUSE.git.",

In recent, the program reduction\ntechnique is widely being used to identify key input features in order to\nexplain the prediction of CI models. The approach removes irrelevant parts from\nan input program and keeps the minimal snippets that a CI model needs to\nmaintain its prediction.

In this manner, the concerns of data\nprivacy are significant since all vehicles collect, process and share personal\nstatistics (e.g. multi-modal, driving statuses and etc.). Therefore, it's\nimportant to understand how modern privacy-preserving techniques suit for IoV.\nWe present the most comprehensive study to characterize modern\nprivacy-preserving techniques for IoV to date. We focus on Differential Privacy\n(DP), a representative set of mathematically-guaranteed mechanisms for both\nprivacy-preserving processing and sharing on sensitive data. The purpose of our\nstudy is to demystify the tradeoffs of deploying DP techniques, in terms of\nservice quality. We first characterize representative privacy-preserving\nprocessing mechanisms, enabled by advanced DP approaches.

As a result, many of the contemporary approaches in\nmodelling intuitive physics for machine cognition have been inspired by\nliterature from cognitive science.

    "abstract": "Real world recommendation systems influence a constantly growing set of\ndomains. With deep networks, that now drive such systems, recommendations have\nbeen more relevant to the user's interests and tasks. However, they may not\nalways be reproducible even if produced by the same system for the same user,\nrecommendation sequence, request, or query. This problem received almost no\nattention in academic publications, but is, in fact, very realistic and\ncritical in real production systems. We consider reproducibility of real large\nscale deep models, whose predictions determine such recommendations. We\ndemonstrate that the celebrated Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation, used\nin deep models, can be a major contributor to irreproducibility. We propose the\nuse of smooth activations to improve recommendation reproducibility. We\ndescribe a novel family of smooth activations; Smooth ReLU (SmeLU), designed to\nimprove reproducibility with mathematical simplicity, with potentially cheaper\nimplementation. SmeLU is a member of a wider family of smooth activations.\nWhile other techniques that improve reproducibility in real systems usually\ncome at accuracy costs, smooth activations not only improve reproducibility,\nbut can even give accuracy gains. We report metrics from real systems in which\nwe were able to productionalize SmeLU with substantial reproducibility gains\nand better accuracy-reproducibility trade-offs. These include\nclick-through-rate (CTR) prediction systems, content, and application\nrecommendation systems.",

Prototypical learning based adversarial discriminative\ndomain adaptation method is developed to encode the inherent emotion-related\nsemantic structure of EEG data.

Through domain adaptation, besides aligning the\nfeature representation of the source and the target on a shared feature space,\nthe feature separability of both source and target domains is also considered.\nThe characterized prototypical representations are evident with a high feature\nconcentration within one single emotion category and a high feature\nseparability across different emotion categories. Extensive experiments are\nconducted on two benchmark databases (SEED and SEED-IV) for recognizing three\nand four emotion categories using four cross-validation evaluation protocols.\nThe experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed PR-PL\nagainst the state-of-the-art methods on cross-subject cross-session,\ncross-subject within-session, within-subject cross-session, and within-subject\nwithin-session evaluation protocols, which shows the power of PR-PL in dealing\nwith the ambiguity of neurophysiological responses in affective studies.",

    "abstract": "Token-mixing multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models have shown competitive\nperformance in computer vision tasks with a simple architecture and relatively\nsmall computational cost. Their success in maintaining computation efficiency\nis mainly attributed to avoiding the use of self-attention that is often\ncomputationally heavy, yet this is at the expense of not being able to mix\ntokens both globally and locally. In this paper, to exploit both global and\nlocal dependencies without self-attention, we present Mix-Shift-MLP (MS-MLP)\nwhich makes the size of the local receptive field used for mixing increase with\nrespect to the amount of spatial shifting. In addition to conventional mixing\nand shifting techniques, MS-MLP mixes both neighboring and distant tokens from\nfine- to coarse-grained levels and then gathers them via a shifting operation.\nThis directly contributes to the interactions between global and local tokens.\nBeing simple to implement, MS-MLP achieves competitive performance in multiple\nvision benchmarks. For example, an MS-MLP with 85 million parameters achieves\n83.8% top-1 classification accuracy on ImageNet-1K. Moreover, by combining\nMS-MLP with state-of-the-art Vision Transformers such as the Swin Transformer,\nwe show MS-MLP achieves further improvements on three different model scales,\ne.g., by 0.5% on ImageNet-1K classification with Swin-B.

Well-written code summaries\nare beneficial for programmers to participate in the software development and\nmaintenance process. To learn the semantic representations of source code,\nrecent efforts focus on incorporating the syntax structure of code into neural\nnetworks such as Transformer. Such Transformer-based approaches can better\ncapture the long-range dependencies than other neural networks including\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), however, most of them do not consider the\nstructural relative correlations between tokens, e.g., relative positions in\nAbstract Syntax Trees (ASTs), which is beneficial for code semantics learning.\nTo model the structural dependency, we propose a Structural Relative Position\nguided Transformer, named SCRIPT. SCRIPT first obtains the structural relative\npositions between tokens via parsing the ASTs of source code, and then passes\nthem into two types of Transformer encoders. One Transformer directly adjusts\nthe input according to the structural relative distance; and the other\nTransformer encodes the structural relative positions during computing the\nself-attention scores. Finally, we stack these two types of Transformer\nencoders to learn representations of source code. Experimental results show\nthat the proposed SCRIPT outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by at least\n1.6%, 1.4% and 2.8% with respect to BLEU, ROUGE-L and METEOR on benchmark\ndatasets, respectively.

Recently, there emerges\na line of works studying \"benign overfitting\" from the theoretical perspective.\nHowever, they are limited to linear models or kernel/random feature models, and\nthere is still a lack of theoretical understanding about when and how benign\noverfitting occurs in neural networks. In this paper, we study the benign\noverfitting phenomenon in training a two-layer convolutional neural network\n(CNN). We show that when the signal-to-noise ratio satisfies a certain\ncondition, a two-layer CNN trained by gradient descent can achieve arbitrarily\nsmall training and test loss. On the other hand, when this condition does not\nhold, overfitting becomes harmful and the obtained CNN can only achieve\nconstant level test loss. These together demonstrate a sharp phase transition\nbetween benign overfitting and harmful overfitting, driven by the\nsignal-to-noise ratio.

Here we focus on the case of\npolynomials with Gaussian integer coefficients, i.e., with real and imaginary\nparts being integers. We design, analyze and compare, theoretically and\npractically,three hybrid numeric-symbolic algorithms computing weighted sums of\nHermitian squares decompositions for trigonometric univariate polynomials\npositive on the unit circle with Gaussian coefficients. The numerical steps the\nfirst and second algorithm rely on are complex root isolation and semidefinite\nprogramming, respectively. An exact sum of Hermitian squares decomposition is\nobtained thanks to compensation techniques. The third algorithm, also based on\ncomplex semidefinite programming, is an adaptation of the rounding and\nprojection algorithm by Peyrl and Parrilo. For all three algorithms, we prove\nbit complexity and output size estimates that are polynomial in the degree of\nthe input and linear in the maximum bitsize of its coefficients.

Unlike conventional\nfeed-forward DNNs, RNNs remember past information to improve the accuracy of\nfuture predictions and, therefore, they are very effective for sequence\nprocessing problems.\nFor each application run, recurrent layers are executed many times for\nprocessing a potentially large sequence of inputs (words, images, audio frames,\netc.). In this paper, we observe that the output of a neuron exhibits small\nchanges in consecutive invocations.~We exploit this property to build a\nneuron-level fuzzy memoization scheme, which dynamically caches each neuron's\noutput and reuses it whenever it is predicted that the current output will be\nsimilar to a previously computed result, avoiding in this way the output\ncomputations.\nThe main challenge in this scheme is determining whether the new neuron's\noutput for the current input in the sequence will be similar to a recently\ncomputed result. To this end, we extend the recurrent layer with a much simpler\nBitwise Neural Network (BNN), and show that the BNN and RNN outputs are highly\ncorrelated: if two BNN outputs are very similar, the corresponding outputs in\nthe original RNN layer are likely to exhibit negligible changes. The BNN\nprovides a low-cost and effective mechanism for deciding when fuzzy memoization\ncan be applied with a small impact on accuracy.\nWe evaluate our memoization scheme on top of a state-of-the-art accelerator\nfor RNNs, for a variety of different neural networks from multiple application\ndomains.

Most of the existing deep-learning-based methods\nconstrain the network to generate derained images but few of them explore\nfeatures from intermediate layers, different levels, and different modules\nwhich are beneficial for rain streaks removal. In this paper, we propose a\nhigh-order collaborative network with multi-scale compact constraints and a\nbidirectional scale-content similarity mining module to exploit features from\ndeep networks externally and internally for rain streaks removal. Externally,\nwe design a deraining framework with three sub-networks trained in a\ncollaborative manner, where the bottom network transmits intermediate features\nto the middle network which also receives shallower rainy features from the top\nnetwork and sends back features to the bottom network. Internally, we enforce\nmulti-scale compact constraints on the intermediate layers of deep networks to\nlearn useful features via a Laplacian pyramid.

Finally, we put\nforward intermediate information supplement to solve the information\nlimitation. Experiments are conducted on Yelp and Amazon datasets. And the\nresults show that our proposed methods effectively solve the three problems.\nAfter applying the three methods, we achieve 4.81%, 6.62% and 6.81%\nimprovements in the metrics of recall, AUC and Macro-F1 respectively on the\nYelp dataset. And we obtain 1.65% and 0.29% improvements in recall and AUC\nrespectively on the Amazon datasets.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents algorithms for local inversion of maps and shows how\nseveral important computational problems such as cryptanalysis of symmetric\nencryption algorithms, RSA algorithm and solving the elliptic curve discrete\nlog problem (ECDLP) can be addressed as local inversion problems. The\nmethodology is termed as the \\emph{Local Inversion Attack}. It utilizes the\nconcept of \\emph{Linear Complexity} (LC) of a recurrence sequence generated by\nthe map defined by the cryptanalysis problem and the given data. It is shown\nthat when the LC of the recurrence is bounded by a bound of polynomial order in\nthe bit length of the input to the map, the local inversion can be accomplished\nin polynomial time. Hence an incomplete local inversion algorithm which\nsearches a solution within a specified bound on computation can estimate the\ndensity of weak cases of cryptanalysis defined by such data causing low LC.\nSuch cases can happen accidentally but cannot be avoided in practice and are\nfatal insecurity flaws of cryptographic primitives which are wrongly assumed to\nbe secure on the basis of exponential average case complexity. An incomplete\nalgorithm is proposed for solving problems such as key recovery of symmetric\nencryption algorithms, decryption of RSA ciphertext without factoring the\nmodulus, decrypting any ciphertext of RSA given one plaintext ciphertext pair\ncreated with same private key in chosen ciphertext attack and solving the\ndiscrete logarithm on elliptic curves over finite fields (ECDLP) as local\ninversion problems. It is shown that when the LCs of the respective recurrences\nfor given data are small, solutions of these problems are possible in\npractically feasible time and memory resources.",

    "abstract": "Medication recommendation targets to provide a proper set of medicines\naccording to patients' diagnoses, which is a critical task in clinics.\nCurrently, the recommendation is manually conducted by doctors. However, for\ncomplicated cases, like patients with multiple diseases at the same time, it's\ndifficult to propose a considerate recommendation even for experienced doctors.\nThis urges the emergence of automatic medication recommendation which can help\ntreat the diagnosed diseases without causing harmful drug-drug interactions.Due\nto the clinical value, medication recommendation has attracted growing research\ninterests.Existing works mainly formulate medication recommendation as a\nmulti-label classification task to predict the set of medicines. In this paper,\nwe propose the Conditional Generation Net (COGNet) which introduces a novel\ncopy-or-predict mechanism to generate the set of medicines. Given a patient,\nthe proposed model first retrieves his or her historical diagnoses and\nmedication recommendations and mines their relationship with current diagnoses.\nThen in predicting each medicine, the proposed model decides whether to copy a\nmedicine from previous recommendations or to predict a new one. This process is\nquite similar to the decision process of human doctors. We validate the\nproposed model on the public MIMIC data set, and the experimental results show\nthat the proposed model can outperform state-of-the-art approaches.",

In this way, using a naive data compression\nalgorithm with a properly selected quality can largely boost recent strong\nbaselines by saving more compressed data in a limited storage space.

However, a lot of labeled data is needed to train CNN, and the common\nCNN can not quantify the aleatoric uncertainty caused by data noise. In actual\nengineering, the noiseless and labeled training data is hardly obtained for the\nTFR. To solve these two problems, this paper proposes a deep Monte Carlo\nquantile regression (Deep MC-QR) method for reconstructing the temperature\nfield and quantifying aleatoric uncertainty caused by data noise. On the one\nhand, the Deep MC-QR method uses physical knowledge to guide the training of\nCNN. Thereby, the Deep MC-QR method can reconstruct an accurate TFR surrogate\nmodel without any labeled training data. On the other hand, the Deep MC-QR\nmethod constructs a quantile level image for each input in each training epoch.\nThen, the trained CNN model can quantify aleatoric uncertainty by quantile\nlevel image sampling during the prediction stage. Finally, the effectiveness of\nthe proposed Deep MC-QR method is validated by many experiments, and the\ninfluence of data noise on TFR is analyzed.",

Since an infinite number of concrete scenarios can theoretically occur\nin real-world road traffic, the extraction of relevant scenarios that are\nsensitive regarding the safety-related behavior of ADS-equipped vehicles is a\nkey aspect for the successful verification and validation of these systems.\nTherefore, this paper provides a method for extracting multimodal urban traffic\nscenarios from naturalistic road traffic data in an unsupervised manner for\nminimizing the amount of (potentially biased) prior expert knowledge needed.\nRather than an (expensive) rule-based assignment by extracting concrete\nscenarios into predefined functional scenarios, the presented method deploys an\nunsupervised machine learning pipeline. It includes principal feature analysis,\nfeature extraction with so-called scenario grids, dimensionality reduction by\nprincipal component analysis, scenario clustering as well as cluster\nvalidation. The approach allows exploring the unknown natures of the data and\ninterpreting them as scenarios that experts could not have anticipated. The\nmethod is demonstrated and evaluated for naturalistic road traffic data at\nurban intersections from the inD and the Silicon Valley dataset.

    "abstract": "Hard interaction learning between source sequences and their next targets is\nchallenging, which exists in a myriad of sequential prediction tasks. During\nthe training process, most existing methods focus on explicitly hard\ninteractions caused by wrong responses. However, a model might conduct correct\nresponses by capturing a subset of learnable patterns, which results in\nimplicitly hard interactions with some unlearned patterns. As such, its\ngeneralization performance is weakened. The problem gets more serious in\nsequential prediction due to the interference of substantial similar candidate\ntargets.\nTo this end, we propose a Hardness Aware Interaction Learning framework\n(HAIL) that mainly consists of two base sequential learning networks and mutual\nexclusivity distillation (MED). The base networks are initialized differently\nto learn distinctive view patterns, thus gaining different training\nexperiences. The experiences in the form of the unlikelihood of correct\nresponses are drawn from each other by MED, which provides mutual exclusivity\nknowledge to figure out implicitly hard interactions. Moreover, we deduce that\nthe unlikelihood essentially introduces additional gradients to push the\npattern learning of correct responses. Our framework can be easily extended to\nmore peer base networks. Evaluation is conducted on four datasets covering\ncyber and physical spaces. The experimental results demonstrate that our\nframework outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of top-k based\nmetrics.",

In the former, all nodes\nhave to compute local tables, which allows them to look up the distance\n(estimates) to any target node in the local network when provided with the\nlabel of the target. In the latter, it suffices that nodes give the next node\non an (approximately) shortest path to the target.\nOur goal is to compute these local tables as fast as possible with labels as\nsmall as possible. We show that this can be done exactly in $\\widetilde\nO(n^{1/3})$ communication rounds and labels of size $\\Theta(n^{2/3})$ bits. For\nconstant stretch approximations we achieve labels of size $O(\\log n)$ in the\nsame time. Further, as our main technical contribution, we provide\ncomputational lower bounds for a variety of problem parameters. For instance,\nwe show that computing solutions with stretch below a certain constant takes\n$\\widetilde \\Omega(n^{1/3})$ rounds even for labels of size $O(n^{2/3})$.",

Instead of using a fixed virtual\nmachine (VM) infrastructure, which can incur considerable costs to operate and\nrun, serverless platforms support short computations, triggered on demand, with\ncost proportional to fine-grain function execution time. However, serverless\nplatforms offer a restricted execution environment. For example, functions have\nlimited execution times, limited resources, and no support for networking\nbetween functions. In this paper, we explore what it takes to treat serverless\nplatforms as short-lived, general purpose data-centers which can execute\nunmodified existing applications. As a first step in this quest, we have\ndeveloped Boxer, a system providing an execution environment on top of existing\nfunctions-as-a-service platforms that allows users to seamlessly migrate\nconventional VM-based cloud services to serverless platforms. Boxer allows\ngeneric applications to benefit from the fine-grain elasticity of serverless\nplatforms without having to modify applications to adopt a restrictive\nevent-triggered programming model or orchestrate auxiliary systems for data\ncommunication.

Points are not allowed to\ntouch each other, they have to be separated by 0-cells, and every 0-cell can\nfind at least one point in its Moore-neighborhood. Probabilistic rules are\ndesigned that can solve this task with asynchronous updating and cyclic\nboundary condition. The task is considered as a tiling problem, where point\ntiles are used to cover the space with overlaps. A point tile consists of a\ncenter pixel (the kernel with value 1) and 8 surrounding pixels forming the\nhull with value 0. The term pixel is used to distinguish the cells of a tile\nfrom the cells of a cellular automaton. For each of the 9 tile pixels a\nso-called template is defined by a shift of the point tile. In the rule\napplication, the 9 templates are tested at the actual cell position. If all\ntemplate pixels (except the central reference pixel) of a template match with\nthe corresponding neighbors of the actual cell under consideration, the cell's\nstate is adjusted to the reference pixel's value. Otherwise the cell is set to\nthe random value 0 or 1 with a certain probability. The hull pixels are allowed\nto overlap. In order to evolve a maximum of points, the overlap between tiles\nhas to be maximized. To do that, the number of template hits is counted.\nDepending on the hit-number, additional noise is injected with certain\nprobabilities.

    "abstract": "Correct-by-construction synthesis is a cornerstone of the confluence of\nformal methods and control theory towards designing safety-critical systems.\nInstead of following the time-tested, albeit laborious\n(re)design-verify-validate loop, correct-by-construction methodology advocates\nthe use of continual refinements of formal requirements -- connected by chains\nof formal proofs -- to build a system that assures the correctness by design. A\nremarkable progress has been made in scaling the scope of applicability of\ncorrect-by-construction synthesis -- with a focus on cyber-physical systems\nthat tie discrete-event control with continuous environment -- to enlarge\ncontrol systems by combining symbolic approaches with principled state-space\nreduction techniques.\nUnfortunately, in the security-critical control systems, the security\nproperties are verified ex post facto the design process in a way that\nundermines the correct-by-construction paradigm. We posit that, to truly\nrealize the dream of correct-by-construction synthesis for security-critical\nsystems, security considerations must take center-stage with the safety\nconsiderations. Moreover, catalyzed by the recent progress on the opacity\nsub-classes of security properties and the notion of hyperproperties capable of\ncombining security with safety properties, we believe that the time is ripe for\nthe research community to holistically target the challenge of\nsecure-by-construction synthesis. This paper details our vision by highlighting\nthe recent progress and open challenges that may serve as bricks for providing\na solid foundation for secure-by-construction synthesis of cyber-physical\nsystems.",

To close this gap, we introduce a\nmodular framework to facilitate the design of provably live and efficient\nByzantine SMR protocols.

We present a simple formal specification of an SMR synchronizer and\nits bounded-space implementation under partial synchrony.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaption (UDA) aims to adapt models learned from a\nwell-annotated source domain to a target domain, where only unlabeled samples\nare given. Current UDA approaches learn domain-invariant features by aligning\nsource and target feature spaces. Such alignments are imposed by constraints\nsuch as statistical discrepancy minimization or adversarial training. However,\nthese constraints could lead to the distortion of semantic feature structures\nand loss of class discriminability. In this paper, we introduce a novel prompt\nlearning paradigm for UDA, named Domain Adaptation via Prompt Learning (DAPL).\nIn contrast to prior works, our approach makes use of pre-trained\nvision-language models and optimizes only very few parameters. The main idea is\nto embed domain information into prompts, a form of representations generated\nfrom natural language, which is then used to perform classification. This\ndomain information is shared only by images from the same domain, thereby\ndynamically adapting the classifier according to each domain. By adopting this\nparadigm, we show that our model not only outperforms previous methods on\nseveral cross-domain benchmarks but also is very efficient to train and easy to\nimplement.",

Recent keypoint-free methods bypass the detection of repeatable\nkeypoints which is difficult in low-overlap scenarios, showing great potential\nin registration.

Such sparse and loose matching requires\ncontextual features capturing the geometric structure of the point clouds. We\npropose Geometric Transformer to learn geometric feature for robust superpoint\nmatching. It encodes pair-wise distances and triplet-wise angles, making it\nrobust in low-overlap cases and invariant to rigid transformation.

While coercion-resistant voting systems address this\nchallenge, current schemes assume that the voter has access to an untappable,\nincorruptible device during voter registration. We present TRIP, an in-person\nvoter registration scheme enabling voters to create verifiable and\nindistinguishable real and fake credentials using an untrusted kiosk inside a\nprivacy booth at a supervised location, e.g., the registrar's office. TRIP\nensures the integrity of the voter's real credential while enabling the\ncreation of fake credentials using interactive zero-knowledge proofs between\nthe voter as the verifier and the kiosk as the prover, unbeknownst to the\naverage voter. TRIP ensures that even voters who are under extreme coercion,\nand cannot leave the booth with a real credential, can delegate their vote to a\npolitical party, with the caveat that they must then trust the kiosk. TRIP\noptimizes the tallying process by limiting the number of credentials a voter\ncan receive and capping the number of votes that a credential can cast per\nelection. We conduct a preliminary usability study among 41 participants at a\nuniversity and found that 42.5% of participants rated TRIP a B or higher in\nusability, a promising result for a voter registration scheme that\nsubstantially reduces trust in the registrar.",

Nonetheless, existing implementations of money\ntransfer still require a quadratic message complexity per payment, making\nattempts to scale hard. In common blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum,\nthis cost is mitigated by payment channels implemented as a second layer on top\nof the blockchain allowing to make many off-chain payments between two users\nwho share a channel. Such channels only require on-chain transactions for\nchannel opening and closing, while the intermediate payments are done off-chain\nwith constant message complexity. But payment channels in-use today require\nsynchrony, therefore they are inadequate for asynchronous money transfer\nsystems.\nIn this paper, we provide a series of possibility and impossibility results\nfor payment channels in asynchronous money transfer systems. We first prove a\nquadratic lower bound on the message complexity of on-chain transfers. Then, we\nexplore two types of payment channels, unidirectional and bidirectional.

We first propose a novel reduction from any\n(general) dueling bandits to multi-armed bandits and despite the simplicity, it\nallows us to improve many existing results in dueling bandits. In particular,\n\\emph{we give the first best-of-both world result for the dueling bandits\nregret minimization problem} -- a unified framework that is guaranteed to\nperform optimally for both stochastic and adversarial preferences\nsimultaneously. Moreover, our algorithm is also the first to achieve an optimal\n$O(\\sum_{i = 1}^K \\frac{\\log T}{\\Delta_i})$ regret bound against the\nCondorcet-winner benchmark, which scales optimally both in terms of the\narm-size $K$ and the instance-specific suboptimality gaps $\\{\\Delta_i\\}_{i =\n1}^K$. This resolves the long-standing problem of designing an instancewise\ngap-dependent order optimal regret algorithm for dueling bandits (with matching\nlower bounds up to small constant factors). We further justify the robustness\nof our proposed algorithm by proving its optimal regret rate under\nadversarially corrupted preferences -- this outperforms the existing\nstate-of-the-art corrupted dueling results by a large margin. In summary, we\nbelieve our reduction idea will find a broader scope in solving a diverse class\nof dueling bandits setting, which are otherwise studied separately from\nmulti-armed bandits with often more complex solutions and worse guarantees.

We present\nfundamental explanations to help better understand the nature of MSAs. In\nparticular, we demonstrate the following properties of MSAs and Vision\nTransformers (ViTs): (1) MSAs improve not only accuracy but also generalization\nby flattening the loss landscapes. Such improvement is primarily attributable\nto their data specificity, not long-range dependency. On the other hand, ViTs\nsuffer from non-convex losses. Large datasets and loss landscape smoothing\nmethods alleviate this problem; (2) MSAs and Convs exhibit opposite behaviors.\nFor example, MSAs are low-pass filters, but Convs are high-pass filters.\nTherefore, MSAs and Convs are complementary; (3) Multi-stage neural networks\nbehave like a series connection of small individual models. In addition, MSAs\nat the end of a stage play a key role in prediction. Based on these insights,\nwe propose AlterNet, a model in which Conv blocks at the end of a stage are\nreplaced with MSA blocks.

    "title": "Active and Passive Hybrid Detection Method for Power CPS False Data  Injection Attacks with Improved AKF and GRU-CNN",
    "abstract": "Influenced by deep penetration of the new generation of information\ntechnology, power systems have gradually evolved into highly coupled\ncyber-physical systems (CPS). Among many possible power CPS network attacks, a\nfalse data injection attacks (FDIAs) is the most serious. Taking account of the\nfact that the existing knowledge-driven detection process for FDIAs has been in\na passive detection state for a long time and ignores the advantages of\ndata-driven active capture of features, an active and passive hybrid detection\nmethod for power CPS FDIAs with improved adaptive Kalman filter (AKF) and\nconvolutional neural networks (CNN) is proposed in this paper. First, we\nanalyze the shortcomings of the traditional AKF algorithm in terms of filtering\ndivergence and calculation speed. The state estimation algorithm based on\nnon-negative positive-definite adaptive Kalman filter (NDAKF) is improved, and\na passive detection method of FDIAs is constructed, with similarity Euclidean\ndistance detection and residual detection at its core. Then, combined with the\nadvantages of gate recurrent unit (GRU) and CNN in terms of temporal memory and\nfeature-expression ability, an active detection method of FDIAs based on a\nGRU-CNN hybrid neural network is proposed. Finally, the results of joint\nknowledge-driven and data-driven parallel detection are used to define a mixed\nfixed-calculation formula, and an active and passive hybrid detection method of\nFDIAs is established, considering the characteristic constraints of the\nparallel mode. A simulation system example of power CPS FDIAs verifies the\neffectiveness and accuracy of the method proposed in this paper.",

    "abstract": "This paper discusses a low-cost, open-source and open-hardware design and\nperformance evaluation of a low-speed, multi-fan wind system dedicated to micro\nair vehicle (MAV) testing. In addition, a set of experiments with a flapping\nwing MAV and rotorcraft is presented, demonstrating the capabilities of the\nsystem and the properties of these different types of drones in response to\nvarious types of wind. We performed two sets of experiments where a MAV is\nflying into the wake of the fan system, gathering data about states, battery\nvoltage and current. Firstly, we focus on steady wind conditions with wind\nspeeds ranging from 0.5 m/s to 3.4 m/s. During the second set of experiments,\nwe introduce wind gusts, by periodically modulating the wind speed from 1.3 m/s\nto 3.4 m/s with wind gust oscillations of 0.5 Hz, 0.25 Hz and 0.125 Hz. The\n\"Flapper\" flapping wing MAV requires much larger pitch angles to counter wind\nthan the \"CrazyFlie\" quadrotor. This is due to the Flapper's larger wing\nsurface. In forward flight, its wings do provide extra lift, considerably\nreducing the power consumption. In contrast, the CrazyFlie's power consumption\nstays more constant for different wind speeds. The experiments with the varying\nwind show a quicker gust response by the CrazyFlie compared with the Flapper\ndrone, but both their responses could be further improved. We expect that the\nproposed wind gust system will provide a useful tool to the community to\nachieve such improvements.",

    "abstract": "Short-term passenger flow prediction plays an important role in better\nmanaging the urban rail transit (URT) systems. Emerging deep learning models\nprovide good insights to improve short-term prediction accuracy. However, a\nlarge number of existing prediction models combine diverse neural network\nlayers to improve accuracy, making their model structures extremely complex and\ndifficult to be applied to the real world. Therefore, it is necessary to trade\noff between the model complexity and prediction performance from the\nperspective of real-world applications. To this end, we propose a deep\nlearning-based Graph-GAN model with a simple structure and high prediction\naccuracy to predict short-term passenger flows of the URT network. The\nGraph-GAN consists of two major parts: (1) a simplified and static version of\nthe graph convolution network (GCN) used to extract network topological\ninformation; (2) a generative adversarial network (GAN) used to predict\npassenger flows, with generators and discriminators in GAN just composed of\nsimple fully connected neural networks. The Graph-GAN is tested on two\nlarge-scale real-world datasets from Beijing Subway. A comparison of the\nprediction performance of Graph-GAN with those of several state-of-the-art\nmodels illustrates its superiority and robustness. This study can provide\ncritical experience in conducting short-term passenger flow predictions,\nespecially from the perspective of real-world applications.",

As\na result, deep networks are often seen as black boxes with unclear\ninterpretations and reliability. Understanding the performance of deep neural\nnetworks is one of the greatest scientific challenges. This work aims to apply\nprinciples and techniques from information theory to deep learning models to\nincrease our theoretical understanding and design better algorithms. We first\ndescribe our information-theoretic approach to deep learning. Then, we propose\nusing the Information Bottleneck (IB) theory to explain deep learning systems.\nThe novel paradigm for analyzing networks sheds light on their layered\nstructure, generalization abilities, and learning dynamics. We later discuss\none of the most challenging problems of applying the IB to deep neural networks\n- estimating mutual information. Recent theoretical developments, such as the\nneural tangent kernel (NTK) framework, are used to investigate generalization\nsignals. In our study, we obtained tractable computations of many\ninformation-theoretic quantities and their bounds for infinite ensembles of\ninfinitely wide neural networks. With these derivations, we can determine how\ncompression, generalization, and sample size pertain to the network and how\nthey are related. At the end, we present the dual Information Bottleneck\n(dualIB). This new information-theoretic framework resolves some of the IB's\nshortcomings by merely switching terms in the distortion function.

In this work we aim at developing a control\nframework for OMAVs for reliable physical interaction tasks with articulated\nand movable objects in the presence of possibly unforeseen disturbances, and\nwithout relying on an accurate model of the environment. Inspired by previous\napplications of energy-based controllers for physical interaction, we propose a\npassivity-based impedance and wrench tracking controller in combination with a\nmomentum-based wrench estimator. This is combined with an energy-tank framework\nto guarantee the stability of the system, while energy and power flow-based\nadaptation policies are deployed to enable safe interaction with any type of\npassive environment. The control framework provides formal guarantees of\nstability, which is validated in practice considering the challenging task of\npushing a cart of unknown mass, moving on a surface of unknown friction, as\nwell as subjected to unknown disturbances.

    "abstract": "Presented here is a method for automatic punctuation restoration in Swedish\nusing a BERT model. The method is based on KB-BERT, a publicly available,\nneural network language model pre-trained on a Swedish corpus by National\nLibrary of Sweden. This model has then been fine-tuned for this specific task\nusing a corpus of government texts. With a lower-case and unpunctuated Swedish\ntext as input, the model is supposed to return a grammatically correct\npunctuated copy of the text as output. A successful solution to this problem\nbrings benefits for an array of NLP domains, such as speech-to-text and\nautomated text. Only the punctuation marks period, comma and question marks\nwere considered for the project, due to a lack of data for more rare marks such\nas semicolon. Additionally, some marks are somewhat interchangeable with the\nmore common, such as exclamation points and periods. Thus, the data set had all\nexclamation points replaced with periods. The fine-tuned Swedish BERT model,\ndubbed prestoBERT, achieved an overall F1-score of 78.9. The proposed model\nscored similarly to international counterparts, with Hungarian and Chinese\nmodels obtaining F1-scores of 82.2 and 75.6 respectively. As further\ncomparison, a human evaluation case study was carried out. The human test group\nachieved an overall F1-score of 81.7, but scored substantially worse than\nprestoBERT on both period and comma. Inspecting output sentences from the model\nand humans show satisfactory results, despite the difference in F1-score. The\ndisconnect seems to stem from an unnecessary focus on replicating the exact\nsame punctuation used in the test set, rather than providing any of the number\nof correct interpretations. If the loss function could be rewritten to reward\nall grammatically correct outputs, rather than only the one original example,\nthe performance could improve significantly for both prestoBERT and the human\ngroup.",

    "abstract": "We consider the evolution of curve networks in two dimensions (2d) and\nsurface clusters in three dimensions (3d). The motion of the interfaces is\ndescribed by surface diffusion, with boundary conditions at the triple junction\npoints/lines, where three interfaces meet, and at the boundary points/lines,\nwhere an interface meets a fixed planar boundary. We propose a parametric\nfinite element method based on a suitable variational formulation. The\nconstructed method is semi-implicit and can be shown to satisfy the volume\nconservation of each enclosed bubble and the unconditional energy-stability,\nthus preserving the two fundamental geometric structures of the flow. Besides,\nthe method has very good properties with respect to the distribution of mesh\npoints, thus no mesh smoothing or regularization technique is required. A\ngeneralization of the introduced scheme to the case of anisotropic surface\nenergies and non-neutral external boundaries is also considered. Numerical\nresults are presented for the evolution of two-dimensional curve networks and\nthree-dimensional surface clusters in the cases of both isotropic and\nanisotropic surface energies.",

While recurrent\nneural network, attention mechanism and more recently, graph attention based\nmodels are prevalent, in this paper we propose graph Fourier transform based\nnetwork with features created in the spectral domain. While this approach has\nfound considerable success in the forecasting domain, it has not been explored\nearlier for any natural language processing task. The method relies on creating\nand learning an underlying graph from the raw data and thereby using the\nadjacency matrix to shift to the graph Fourier domain. Subsequently, Fourier\ntransform is used to switch to the frequency (spectral) domain where new\nfeatures are created. These series of transformation proved to be extremely\nefficient in learning the right representation as we have found that our model\nachieves the best result on both the SemEval-2014 datasets, i.e., \"Laptop\" and\n\"Restaurants\" domain.

    "abstract": "Continual learning can enable neural networks to evolve by learning new tasks\nsequentially in task-changing scenarios. However, two general and related\nchallenges should be overcome in further research before we apply this\ntechnique to real-world applications. Firstly, newly collected novelties from\nthe data stream in applications could contain anomalies that are meaningless\nfor continual learning. Instead of viewing them as a new task for updating, we\nhave to filter out such anomalies to reduce the disturbance of extremely\nhigh-entropy data for the progression of convergence. Secondly, fewer efforts\nhave been put into research regarding the explainability of continual learning,\nwhich leads to a lack of transparency and credibility of the updated neural\nnetworks. Elaborated explanations about the process and result of continual\nlearning can help experts in judgment and making decisions. Therefore, we\npropose the conceptual design of an explainability module with experts in the\nloop based on techniques, such as dimension reduction, visualization, and\nevaluation strategies. This work aims to overcome the mentioned challenges by\nsufficiently explaining and visualizing the identified anomalies and the\nupdated neural network.

That is, for every such game, there exists a constant\n$c>0$, such that the value of the $n$-fold parallel repetition of the game is\nat most $n^{-c}$. Along the way to proving this theorem, we prove two\nadditional parallel repetition theorems for multiplayer games, that may be of\nindependent interest:\nPlayerwise Connected Games (with any number of players and any Alphabet\nsize): We identify a large class of multiplayer games and prove that for every\ngame with value $<1$ in that class, the value of the $n$-fold parallel\nrepetition of the game decays polynomially fast to 0. More precisely, our\nresult applies for playerwise connected games, with any number of players and\nany alphabet size. The class of playerwise connected games is strictly larger\nthan the class of connected games that was defined in [DHVY17] and for which\nexponentially fast decay bounds are known [DHVY17]. For playerwise connected\ngames that are not connected, only inverse Ackermann decay bounds were\npreviously known [Ver96].\nExponential Bounds for the Anti-Correlation Game: In the 3-player\nanti-correlation game, two out of three players are given $1$ as input, and the\nremaining player is given $0$. The two players who were given $1$ must produce\ndifferent outputs in $\\{0,1\\}$. We prove that the value of the $n$-fold\nparallel repetition of that game decays exponentially fast to 0. Only inverse\nAckermann decay bounds were previously known [Ver96]. This game was studied and\nmotivated in several previous works.

The problems we consider are classical flow\nand orientation problems, such as Undirected Flow with Lower Bounds (which is\nstrongly NP-complete, as shown by Itai), Minimum Maximum Outdegree (for which\nW[1]-hardness for treewidth was proven by Szeider), and capacitated\noptimization problems such as Capacitated (Red-Blue) Dominating Set (for which\nW[1]-hardness was proven by Dom, Lokshtanov, Saurabh and Villanger). Our\nhardness proofs (that beat existing results) use reduction to a recent\nXNLP-complete problem (Accepting Non-deterministic Checking Counter Machine).\nThe new easy parameterized algorithms use a novel notion of weighted tree\npartition with an associated parameter that we call treebreadth, inspired by\nSeese's notion of tree-partite graphs, as well as techniques from dynamical\nprogramming and integer linear programming.",

    "abstract": "Recently, many pre-trained language models for source code have been proposed\nto model the context of code and serve as a basis for downstream code\nintelligence tasks such as code completion, code search, and code\nsummarization. These models leverage masked pre-training and Transformer and\nhave achieved promising results. However, currently there is still little\nprogress regarding interpretability of existing pre-trained code models. It is\nnot clear why these models work and what feature correlations they can capture.\nIn this paper, we conduct a thorough structural analysis aiming to provide an\ninterpretation of pre-trained language models for source code (e.g., CodeBERT,\nand GraphCodeBERT) from three distinctive perspectives: (1) attention analysis,\n(2) probing on the word embedding, and (3) syntax tree induction. Through\ncomprehensive analysis, this paper reveals several insightful findings that may\ninspire future studies: (1) Attention aligns strongly with the syntax structure\nof code. (2) Pre-training language models of code can preserve the syntax\nstructure of code in the intermediate representations of each Transformer\nlayer. (3) The pre-trained models of code have the ability of inducing syntax\ntrees of code. Theses findings suggest that it may be helpful to incorporate\nthe syntax structure of code into the process of pre-training for better code\nrepresentations.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces the NWPU Team's entry to the ICASSP 2022 AEC Challenge.\nWe take a hybrid approach that cascades a linear AEC with a neural post-filter.\nThe former is used to deal with the linear echo components while the latter\nsuppresses the residual non-linear echo components. We use gated convolutional\nF-T-LSTM neural network (GFTNN) as the backbone and shape the post-filter by a\nmulti-task learning (MTL) framework, where a voice activity detection (VAD)\nmodule is adopted as an auxiliary task along with echo suppression, with the\naim to avoid over suppression that may cause speech distortion. Moreover, we\nadopt an echo-aware loss function, where the mean square error (MSE) loss can\nbe optimized particularly for every time-frequency bins (TF-bins) according to\nthe signal-to-echo ratio (SER), leading to further suppression on the echo.\nExtensive ablation study shows that the time delay estimation (TDE) module in\nneural post-filter leads to better perceptual quality, and an adaptive filter\nwith better convergence will bring consistent performance gain for the\npost-filter. Besides, we find that using the linear echo as the input of our\nneural post-filter is a better choice than using the reference signal directly.\nIn the ICASSP 2022 AEC-Challenge, our approach has ranked the 1st place on word\nacceptance rate (WAcc) (0.817) and the 3rd place on both mean opinion score\n(MOS) (4.502) and the final score (0.864).",

In this paper, we propose HyLa, a completely different\napproach to using hyperbolic space in graph learning: HyLa maps once from a\nlearned hyperbolic-space embedding to Euclidean space via the eigenfunctions of\nthe Laplacian operator in the hyperbolic space. Our method is inspired by the\nrandom Fourier feature methodology, which uses the eigenfunctions of the\nLaplacian in Euclidean space.

    "abstract": "A common explanation for the failure of deep networks to generalize\nout-of-distribution is that they fail to recover the \"correct\" features.\nFocusing on the domain generalization setting, we challenge this notion with a\nsimple experiment which suggests that ERM already learns sufficient features\nand that the current bottleneck is not feature learning, but robust regression.\nWe therefore argue that devising simpler methods for learning predictors on\nexisting features is a promising direction for future research. Towards this\nend, we introduce Domain-Adjusted Regression (DARE), a convex objective for\nlearning a linear predictor that is provably robust under a new model of\ndistribution shift. Rather than learning one function, DARE performs a\ndomain-specific adjustment to unify the domains in a canonical latent space and\nlearns to predict in this space. Under a natural model, we prove that the DARE\nsolution is the minimax-optimal predictor for a constrained set of test\ndistributions. Further, we provide the first finite-environment convergence\nguarantee to the minimax risk, improving over existing results which show a\n\"threshold effect\". Evaluated on finetuned features, we find that DARE compares\nfavorably to prior methods, consistently achieving equal or better performance.",

Inspired by the defense in\ndepth principle, we propose AnoMili, a novel protection system for the\nMIL-STD-1553 bus, which consists of: (i) a physical intrusion detection\nmechanism that detects unauthorized devices connected to the 1553 bus, even if\nthey are passive (sniffing), (ii) a device fingerprinting mechanism that\nprotects against spoofing attacks (two approaches are proposed: prevention and\ndetection), (iii) a context-based anomaly detection mechanism, and (iv) an\nanomaly explanation engine responsible for explaining the detected anomalies in\nreal time. We evaluate AnoMili's effectiveness and practicability in two real\n1553 hardware-based testbeds. The effectiveness of the anomaly explanation\nengine is also demonstrated. All of the detection and prevention mechanisms\nemployed had high detection rates (over 99.45%) with low false positive rates.\nThe context-based anomaly detection mechanism obtained perfect results when\nevaluated on a dataset used in prior work.",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) has become a popular method for generating\ninvariant representations without the need for human annotations. Nonetheless,\nthe desired invariant representation is achieved by utilising prior online\ntransformation functions on the input data. As a result, each SSL framework is\ncustomised for a particular data type, e.g., visual data, and further\nmodifications are required if it is used for other dataset types. On the other\nhand, autoencoder (AE), which is a generic and widely applicable framework,\nmainly focuses on dimension reduction and is not suited for learning invariant\nrepresentation. This paper proposes a generic SSL framework based on a\nconstrained self-labelling assignment process that prevents degenerate\nsolutions. Specifically, the prior transformation functions are replaced with a\nself-transformation mechanism, derived through an unsupervised training process\nof adversarial training, for imposing invariant representations. Via the\nself-transformation mechanism, pairs of augmented instances can be generated\nfrom the same input data. Finally, a training objective based on contrastive\nlearning is designed by leveraging both the self-labelling assignment and the\nself-transformation mechanism. Despite the fact that the self-transformation\nprocess is very generic, the proposed training strategy outperforms a majority\nof state-of-the-art representation learning methods based on AE structures. To\nvalidate the performance of our method, we conduct experiments on four types of\ndata, namely visual, audio, text, and mass spectrometry data, and compare them\nin terms of four quantitative metrics.

Such games model a basic clustering or coalition\nformation scenario in which selfish agents are represented by the vertices of\nan edge-weighted digraph $G=(V,E)$, and the weight of an arc $uv$ denotes the\nutility $u$ gains by being in the same coalition as $v$. We focus on (arguably)\nthe most basic stability question about such a game: given a graph, does a Nash\nstable solution exist and can we find it efficiently?\nWe study the (parameterized) complexity of ASHG stability when the underlying\ngraph has treewidth $t$ and maximum degree $\\Delta$. The current best FPT\nalgorithm for this case was claimed by Peters [AAAI 2016], with time complexity\nroughly $2^{O(\\Delta^5t)}$. We present an algorithm with parameter dependence\n$(\\Delta t)^{O(\\Delta t)}$, significantly improving upon the parameter\ndependence on $\\Delta$ given by Peters, albeit with a slightly worse dependence\non $t$. Our main result is that this slight performance deterioration with\nrespect to $t$ is actually completely justified: we observe that the previously\nclaimed algorithm is incorrect, and that in fact no algorithm can achieve\ndependence $t^{o(t)}$ for bounded-degree graphs, unless the ETH fails. This,\ntogether with corresponding bounds we provide on the dependence on $\\Delta$ and\nthe joint parameter establishes that our algorithm is essentially optimal for\nboth parameters, under the ETH.\nWe then revisit the parameterization by treewidth alone and resolve a\nquestion also posed by Peters by showing that Nash Stability remains strongly\nNP-hard on stars under additive preferences. Nevertheless, we also discover an\nisland of mild tractability: we show that Connected Nash Stability is solvable\nin pseudo-polynomial time for constant $t$, though with an XP dependence on $t$\nwhich, as we establish, cannot be avoided.",

    "abstract": "Evaluation practices in natural language generation (NLG) have many known\nflaws, but improved evaluation approaches are rarely widely adopted. This issue\nhas become more urgent, since neural NLG models have improved to the point\nwhere they can often no longer be distinguished based on the surface-level\nfeatures that older metrics rely on. This paper surveys the issues with human\nand automatic model evaluations and with commonly used datasets in NLG that\nhave been pointed out over the past 20 years. We summarize, categorize, and\ndiscuss how researchers have been addressing these issues and what their\nfindings mean for the current state of model evaluations. Building on those\ninsights, we lay out a long-term vision for NLG evaluation and propose concrete\nsteps for researchers to improve their evaluation processes. Finally, we\nanalyze 66 NLG papers from recent NLP conferences in how well they already\nfollow these suggestions and identify which areas require more drastic changes\nto the status quo.",

Its\ngoal is to present a previously neglected approach to non-adaptive group\ntesting and describes it in terms of residuated pairs on partially ordered\nsets. Our investigation has the advantage, as it naturally yields an efficient\ndecision scheme (decoder) for any given testing scheme. This decoder allows to\ndetect a large amount of infection patterns. Apart from this, we devise a\nconstruction of good group testing schemes that are based on incidence matrices\nof finite partial linear spaces. The key idea is to exploit the structure of\nthese matrices and make them available as test matrices for group testing.\nThese matrices may generally be tailored for different estimated disease\nprevalence levels. As an example, we discuss the group testing schemes based on\ngeneralized quadrangles. In the context at hand, we state our results only for\nthe error-free case so far.

    "abstract": "We study a family of first-order methods with momentum based on mirror\ndescent for online convex optimization, which we dub online mirror descent with\nmomentum (OMDM). Our algorithms include as special cases gradient descent and\nexponential weights update with momentum. We provide a new and simple analysis\nof momentum-based methods in a stochastic setting that yields a regret bound\nthat decreases as momentum increases. This immediately establishes that\nmomentum can help in the convergence of stochastic subgradient descent in\nconvex nonsmooth optimization. We showcase the robustness of our algorithm by\nalso providing an analysis in an adversarial setting that gives the first\nnon-trivial regret bounds for OMDM. Our work aims to provide a better\nunderstanding of the benefits of momentum-based methods, which despite their\nrecent empirical success, is incomplete.\nFinally, we discuss how OMDM can be applied to stochastic online allocation\nproblems, which are central problems in computer science and operations\nresearch. In doing so, we establish an important connection between OMDM and\npopular approaches from optimal control such as PID controllers, thereby\nproviding regret bounds on the performance of PID controllers. The improvements\nof momentum are most pronounced when the step-size is large, thereby indicating\nthat momentum provides a robustness to misspecification of tuning parameters.\nWe provide a numerical evaluation that verifies the robustness of our\nalgorithms.",

    "abstract": "Neural population activity relating to behaviour is assumed to be inherently\nlow-dimensional despite the observed high dimensionality of data recorded using\nmulti-electrode arrays. Therefore, predicting behaviour from neural population\nrecordings has been shown to be most effective when using latent variable\nmodels. Over time however, the activity of single neurons can drift, and\ndifferent neurons will be recorded due to movement of implanted neural probes.\nThis means that a decoder trained to predict behaviour on one day performs\nworse when tested on a different day. On the other hand, evidence suggests that\nthe latent dynamics underlying behaviour may be stable even over months and\nyears. Based on this idea, we introduce a model capable of inferring\nbehaviourally relevant latent dynamics from previously unseen data recorded\nfrom the same animal, without any need for decoder recalibration. We show that\nunsupervised domain adaptation combined with a sequential variational\nautoencoder, trained on several sessions, can achieve good generalisation to\nunseen data and correctly predict behaviour where conventional methods fail.\nOur results further support the hypothesis that behaviour-related neural\ndynamics are low-dimensional and stable over time, and will enable more\neffective and flexible use of brain computer interface technologies.",

    "abstract": "The modelling of multiphase flow in a pipe presents a significant challenge\nfor high-resolution computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models due to the high\naspect ratio (length over diameter) of the domain. In subsea applications, the\npipe length can be several hundreds of kilometres versus a pipe diameter of\njust a few inches. In this paper, we present a new AI-based non-intrusive\nreduced-order model within a domain decomposition framework (AI-DDNIROM) which\nis capable of making predictions for domains significantly larger than the\ndomain used in training. This is achieved by using domain decomposition;\ndimensionality reduction; training a neural network to make predictions for a\nsingle subdomain; and by using an iteration-by-subdomain technique to converge\nthe solution over the whole domain. To find the low-dimensional space, we\nexplore several types of autoencoder networks, known for their ability to\ncompress information accurately and compactly. The performance of the\nautoencoders is assessed on two advection-dominated problems: flow past a\ncylinder and slug flow in a pipe. To make predictions in time, we exploit an\nadversarial network which aims to learn the distribution of the training data,\nin addition to learning the mapping between particular inputs and outputs. This\ntype of network has shown the potential to produce realistic outputs. The whole\nframework is applied to multiphase slug flow in a horizontal pipe for which an\nAI-DDNIROM is trained on high-fidelity CFD simulations of a pipe of length 10 m\nwith an aspect ratio of 13:1, and tested by simulating the flow for a pipe of\nlength 98 m with an aspect ratio of almost 130:1. Statistics of the flows\nobtained from the CFD simulations are compared to those of the AI-DDNIROM\npredictions to demonstrate the success of our approach.",

The airway map could be extracted from\nchest computed tomography (CT) scans automatically by airway segmentation\nmethods. Due to the complex tree-like structure of the airway, preserving its\ntopology completeness while maintaining the segmentation accuracy is a\nchallenging task.\nMethods: In this paper, a long-term slice propagation (LTSP) method is\nproposed for accurate airway segmentation from pathological CT scans. We also\ndesign a two-stage end-to-end segmentation framework utilizing the LTSP method\nin the decoding process. Stage 1 is used to generate a coarse feature map by an\nencoder-decoder architecture. Stage 2 is to adopt the proposed LTSP method for\nexploiting the continuity information and enhancing the weak airway features in\nthe coarse feature map. The final segmentation result is predicted from the\nrefined feature map.\nResults: Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of\nthe proposed method on 70 clinical CT scans. The results demonstrate the\nconsiderable improvements of the proposed method compared to some\nstate-of-the-art methods as most breakages are eliminated and more tiny bronchi\nare detected. The ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of the\nconstituents of the proposed method.\nConclusion: Slice continuity information is beneficial to accurate airway\nsegmentation. Furthermore, by propagating the long-term slice feature, the\nairway topology connectivity is preserved with overall segmentation accuracy\nmaintained.",

    "abstract": "In cone-beam X-ray transmission imaging, due to the divergence of X-rays,\nimaged structures with different depths have different magnification factors on\nan X-ray detector, which results in perspective deformation. Perspective\ndeformation causes difficulty in direct, accurate geometric assessments of\nanatomical structures. In this work, to reduce perspective deformation in X-ray\nimages acquired from regular cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) systems, we\ninvestigate on learning perspective deformation, i.e., converting perspective\nprojections into orthogonal projections. Directly converting a single\nperspective projection image into an orthogonal projection image is extremely\nchallenging due to the lack of depth information. Therefore, we propose to\nutilize one additional perspective projection, a complementary (180-degree) or\northogonal (90-degree) view, to provide a certain degree of depth information.\nFurthermore, learning perspective deformation in different spatial domains is\ninvestigated. Our proposed method is evaluated on numerical spherical bead\nphantoms as well as patients' chest and head X-ray data. The experiments on\nnumerical bead phantom data demonstrate that learning perspective deformation\nin polar coordinates has significant advantages over learning in Cartesian\ncoordinates, as root-mean-square error (RMSE) decreases from 5.31 to 1.40,\nwhile learning in log-polar coordinates has no further considerable improvement\n(RMSE = 1.85). In addition, using a complementary view (RMSE = 1.40) is better\nthan an orthogonal view (RMSE = 3.87). The experiments on patients' chest and\nhead data demonstrate that learning perspective deformation using dual\ncomplementary views is also applicable in anatomical X-ray data, allowing\naccurate cardiothoracic ratio measurements in chest X-ray images and\ncephalometric analysis in synthetic cephalograms from cone-beam X-ray\nprojections.",

The use of a `holdout set' -- a subset of the population that does\nnot receive interventions guided by the model -- has been proposed to prevent\nthis. Since patients in the holdout set do not benefit from risk predictions,\nthe chosen size must trade off maximising model performance whilst minimising\nthe number of held out patients.

    "abstract": "For centuries, it has been widely believed that the influence of a small\ncoalition of voters is negligible in a large election. Consequently, there is a\nlarge body of literature on characterizing the asymptotic likelihood for an\nelection to be influence, especially by the manipulation of a single voter,\nestablishing an $O(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt n})$ upper bound and an\n$\\Omega(\\frac{1}{n^{67}})$ lower bound for many commonly studied voting rules\nunder the i.i.d.~uniform distribution, known as Impartial Culture (IC) in\nsocial choice, where $n$ is the number is voters.\nIn this paper, we extend previous studies in three aspects: (1) we consider a\nmore general and realistic semi-random model that resembles the model in\nsmoothed analysis, (2) we consider many coalitional influence problems,\nincluding coalitional manipulation, margin of victory, and various vote\ncontrols and bribery, and (3) we consider arbitrary and variable coalition size\n$B$. Our main theorem provides asymptotically tight bounds on the semi-random\nlikelihood of the existence of a size-$B$ coalition that can successfully\ninfluence the election under a wide range of voting rules. Applications of the\nmain theorem and its proof techniques resolve long-standing open questions\nabout the likelihood of coalitional manipulability under IC, by showing that\nthe likelihood is $\\Theta\\left(\\min\\left\\{\\frac{B}{\\sqrt n}, 1\\right\\}\\right)$\nfor many commonly studied voting rules.\nThe main technical contribution is a characterization of the semi-random\nlikelihood for a Poisson multinomial variable (PMV) to be unstable, which we\nbelieve to be a general and useful technique with independent interest.",

    "title": "Gravity Estimation at Small Bodies via Optical Tracking of Hopping  Artificial Probes",
    "abstract": "Despite numerous successful missions to small celestial bodies, the gravity\nfield of such targets has been poorly characterized so far. Gravity estimates\ncan be used to infer the internal structure and composition of small bodies\nand, as such, have strong implications in the fields of planetary science,\nplanetary defense, and in-situ resource utilization. Current gravimetry\ntechniques at small bodies mostly rely on tracking the spacecraft orbital\nmotion, where the gravity observability is low. To date, only lower-degree and\norder spherical harmonics of small-body gravity fields could be resolved. In\nthis paper, we evaluate gravimetry performance for a novel mission architecture\nwhere artificial probes repeatedly hop across the surface of the small body and\nperform low-altitude, suborbital arcs. Such probes are tracked using optical\nmeasurements from the mothership's onboard camera and orbit determination is\nperformed to estimate the probe trajectories, the small body's rotational\nkinematics, and the gravity field. The suborbital motion of the probes provides\ndense observations at low altitude, where the gravity signal is stronger. We\nassess the impact of observation parameters and mission duration on gravity\nobservability. Results suggest that the gravitational spherical harmonics of a\nsmall body with the same mass as the asteroid Bennu, can be observed at least\nup to degree 40 within months of observations. Measurement precision and\nfrequency are key to achieve high-performance gravimetry.",

In particular, this study demonstrates the necessity\nof the design of experiment schemes for the Physics-Informed Neural Network\n(PINN), which belongs to the supervised learning class. Many complex partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs) do not have any analytical solution; only\nnumerical methods are used to solve the equations, which is computationally\nexpensive. In recent decades, PINN has gained popularity as a replacement for\nnumerical methods to reduce the computational budget. PINN uses physical\ninformation in the form of differential equations to enhance the performance of\nthe neural networks. Though it works efficiently, the choice of the design of\nexperiment scheme is important as the accuracy of the predicted responses using\nPINN depends on the training data. In this study, five different PDEs are used\nfor numerical purposes, i.e., viscous Burger's equation, Shr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation, heat equation, Allen-Cahn equation, and Korteweg-de Vries equation.

    "abstract": "In medical image segmentation, images are usually annotated by several\ndifferent clinical experts. This clinical routine helps to mitigate the\npersonal bias. However, Computer Vision models often assume there has a unique\nground-truth for each of the instance. This research gap between Computer\nVision and medical routine is commonly existed but less explored by the current\nresearch.In this paper, we try to answer the following two questions: 1. How to\nlearn an optimal combination of the multiple segmentation labels? and 2. How to\nestimate this segmentation mask from the raw image? We note that in clinical\npractice, the image segmentation mask usually exists as an auxiliary\ninformation for disease diagnosis. Adhering to this mindset, we propose a\nframework taking the diagnosis result as the gold standard, to estimate the\nsegmentation mask upon the multi-rater segmentation labels, named DiFF\n(Diagnosis First segmentation Framework).DiFF is implemented by two novelty\ntechniques. First, DFSim (Diagnosis First Simulation of gold label) is learned\nas an optimal combination of multi-rater segmentation labels for the disease\ndiagnosis. Then, toward estimating DFSim mask from the raw image, we further\npropose T\\&G Module (Take and Give Module) to instill the diagnosis knowledge\ninto the segmentation network.

In particular, a\nstochastic state-based peridynamic model is developed, where the\nmicromechanical parameters are modeled by a finite-dimensional random vector,\nor a combination of random variables truncating the Karhunen-Lo\\`{e}ve\ndecomposition or the principle component analysis (PCA).

    "abstract": "Increased levels of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue\nindicate favourable outcomes in many types of cancer. Manual quantification of\nimmune cells is inaccurate and time consuming for pathologists. Our aim is to\nleverage a computational solution to automatically quantify TILs in whole slide\nimages (WSIs) of standard diagnostic haematoxylin and eosin stained sections\n(H&E slides) from lung cancer patients. Our approach is to transfer an open\nsource machine learning method for segmentation and classification of nuclei in\nH&E slides trained on public data to TIL quantification without manual labeling\nof our data. Our results show that additional augmentation improves model\ntransferability when training on few samples/limited tissue types. Models\ntrained with sufficient samples/tissue types do not benefit from our additional\naugmentation policy. Further, the resulting TIL quantification correlates to\npatient prognosis and compares favorably to the current state-of-the-art method\nfor immune cell detection in non-small lung cancer (current standard CD8 cells\nin DAB stained TMAs HR 0.34 95% CI 0.17-0.68 vs TILs in HE WSIs: HoVer-Net\nPanNuke Aug Model HR 0.30 95% CI 0.15-0.60, HoVer-Net MoNuSAC Aug model HR 0.27\n95% CI 0.14-0.53). Moreover, we implemented a cloud based system to train,\ndeploy and visually inspect machine learning based annotation for H&E slides.\nOur pragmatic approach bridges the gap between machine learning research,\ntranslational clinical research and clinical implementation. However,\nvalidation in prospective studies is needed to assert that the method works in\na clinical setting.",

The sampling distribution of the DTW distance is too\ncomplicated to derive because it is obtained based on the solution of a\ncomplicated algorithm. To circumvent this difficulty, we propose to employ a\nconditional sampling distribution for the inference, which enables us to derive\nan exact (non-asymptotic) inference method on the DTW distance. Besides, we\nalso develop a novel computational method to compute the conditional sampling\ndistribution.

    "abstract": "Segmentation and spatial alignment of ultrasound (US) imaging data acquired\nin the in first trimester are crucial for monitoring human embryonic growth and\ndevelopment throughout this crucial period of life. Current approaches are\neither manual or semi-automatic and are therefore very time-consuming and prone\nto errors. To automate these tasks, we propose a multi-atlas framework for\nautomatic segmentation and spatial alignment of the embryo using deep learning\nwith minimal supervision. Our framework learns to register the embryo to an\natlas, which consists of the US images acquired at a range of gestational age\n(GA), segmented and spatially aligned to a predefined standard orientation.\nFrom this, we can derive the segmentation of the embryo and put the embryo in\nstandard orientation. US images acquired at 8+0 till 12+6 weeks GA were used\nand eight pregnancies were selected as atlas images. We evaluated different\nfusion strategies to incorporate multiple atlases: 1) training the framework\nusing atlas images from a single pregnancy, 2) training the framework with data\nof all available atlases and 3) ensembling of the frameworks trained per\npregnancy. To evaluate the performance, we calculated the Dice score over the\ntest set. We found that training the framework using all available atlases\noutperformed ensembling and gave similar results compared to the best of all\nframeworks trained on a single subject. Furthermore, we found that selecting\nimages from the four atlases closest in GA out of all available atlases,\nregardless of the individual quality, gave the best results with a median Dice\nscore of 0.72. We conclude that our framework can accurately segment and\nspatially align the embryo in first trimester 3D US images and is robust for\nthe variation in quality that existed in the available atlases.

Optimizing video\ncompression has the potential to increase access and quality of content to\nusers, and reduce energy use and costs overall. In this paper, we present an\napplication of the MuZero algorithm to the challenge of video compression.\nSpecifically, we target the problem of learning a rate control policy to select\nthe quantization parameters (QP) in the encoding process of libvpx, an open\nsource VP9 video compression library widely used by popular video-on-demand\n(VOD) services. We treat this as a sequential decision making problem to\nmaximize the video quality with an episodic constraint imposed by the target\nbitrate. Notably, we introduce a novel self-competition based reward mechanism\nto solve constrained RL with variable constraint satisfaction difficulty, which\nis challenging for existing constrained RL methods. We demonstrate that the\nMuZero-based rate control achieves an average 6.28% reduction in size of the\ncompressed videos for the same delivered video quality level (measured as PSNR\nBD-rate) compared to libvpx's two-pass VBR rate control policy, while having\nbetter constraint satisfaction behavior.",

    "abstract": "The past few years have witnessed the significant advances of speech\nsynthesis and voice conversion technologies. However, such technologies can\nundermine the robustness of broadly implemented biometric identification models\nand can be harnessed by in-the-wild attackers for illegal uses. The ASVspoof\nchallenge mainly focuses on synthesized audios by advanced speech synthesis and\nvoice conversion models, and replay attacks. Recently, the first Audio Deep\nSynthesis Detection challenge (ADD 2022) extends the attack scenarios into more\naspects. Also ADD 2022 is the first challenge to propose the partially fake\naudio detection task. Such brand new attacks are dangerous and how to tackle\nsuch attacks remains an open question. Thus, we propose a novel framework by\nintroducing the question-answering (fake span discovery) strategy with the\nself-attention mechanism to detect partially fake audios. The proposed fake\nspan detection module tasks the anti-spoofing model to predict the start and\nend positions of the fake clip within the partially fake audio, address the\nmodel's attention into discovering the fake spans rather than other shortcuts\nwith less generalization, and finally equips the model with the discrimination\ncapacity between real and partially fake audios.

To address this, we present an alternative system-level algorithm\nthat implements channel-specific AGC in a silicon spiking cochlea by measuring\nthe output spike activity of individual channels. The bandpass filter gain of a\nchannel is adapted dynamically to the input amplitude so that the average\noutput spike rate stays within a defined range. Because this AGC mechanism only\nneeds counting and adding operations, it can be implemented at low hardware\ncost in a future design. We evaluate the impact of the local AGC algorithm on a\nclassification task where the input signal varies over 32 dB input range. Two\nclassifier types receiving cochlea spike features were tested on a speech\nversus noise classification task. The logistic regression classifier achieves\nan average of 6% improvement and 40.8% relative improvement in accuracy when\nthe AGC is enabled. The deep neural network classifier shows a similar\nimprovement for the AGC case and achieves a higher mean accuracy of 96%\ncompared to the best accuracy of 91% from the logistic regression classifier.",

Recent\nworks have shown that machine learning (ML) can be integrated with an MIP\nsolver to inject domain knowledge and efficiently close the optimality gap.\nThis hybridization is usually done with deep learning (DL), which requires a\nlarge dataset and extensive hyperparameter tuning to perform well. This paper\nproposes an online heuristic that uses the notion of entropy to efficiently\nbuild a model with minimal training data and tuning. We test our method on the\nlocomotive assignment problem (LAP), a recurring real-world problem that is\nchallenging to solve at scale. Experimental results show a speed up of an order\nof magnitude compared to a general purpose solver (CPLEX) with a relative gap\nof less than 2%.

    "abstract": "Model identifiability is a desirable property in the context of unsupervised\nrepresentation learning. In absence thereof, different models may be\nobservationally indistinguishable while yielding representations that are\nnontrivially related to one another, thus making the recovery of a ground truth\ngenerative model fundamentally impossible, as often shown through suitably\nconstructed counterexamples. In this note, we discuss one such construction,\nillustrating a potential failure case of an identifiability result presented in\n\"Desiderata for Representation Learning: A Causal Perspective\" by Wang & Jordan\n(2021). The construction is based on the theory of nonlinear independent\ncomponent analysis. We comment on implications of this and other\ncounterexamples for identifiable representation learning.",

    "abstract": "Haemorrhaging of the brain is the leading cause of death in people between\nthe ages of 15 and 24 and the third leading cause of death in people older than\nthat. Computed tomography (CT) is an imaging modality used to diagnose\nneurological emergencies, including stroke and traumatic brain injury. Recent\nadvances in Deep Learning and Image Processing have utilised different\nmodalities like CT scans to help automate the detection and segmentation of\nbrain haemorrhage occurrences. In this paper, we propose a novel implementation\nof an architecture consisting of traditional Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN)\nalong with Graph Neural Networks(GNN) to produce a holistic model for the task\nof brain haemorrhage segmentation.GNNs work on the principle of neighbourhood\naggregation thus providing a reliable estimate of global structures present in\nimages. GNNs work with few layers thus in turn requiring fewer parameters to\nwork with. We were able to achieve a dice coefficient score of around 0.81 with\nlimited data with our implementation.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of counterfactual inference in sequentially designed\nexperiments wherein a collection of $\\mathbf{N}$ units each undergo a sequence\nof interventions for $\\mathbf{T}$ time periods, based on policies that\nsequentially adapt over time. Our goal is counterfactual inference, i.e.,\nestimate what would have happened if alternate policies were used, a problem\nthat is inherently challenging due to the heterogeneity in the outcomes across\nunits and time. To tackle this task, we introduce a suitable latent factor\nmodel where the potential outcomes are determined by exogenous unit and time\nlevel latent factors. Under suitable conditions, we show that it is possible to\nestimate the missing (potential) outcomes using a simple variant of nearest\nneighbors. First, assuming a bilinear latent factor model and allowing for an\narbitrary adaptive sampling policy, we establish a distribution-free\nnon-asymptotic guarantee for estimating the missing outcome of any unit at any\ntime; under suitable regularity condition, this guarantee implies that our\nestimator is consistent. Second, for a generic non-parametric latent factor\nmodel, we establish that the estimate for the missing outcome of any unit at\ntime $\\mathbf{T}$ satisfies a central limit theorem as $\\mathbf{T} \\to \\infty$,\nunder suitable regularity conditions. Finally, en route to establishing this\ncentral limit theorem, we establish a non-asymptotic mean-squared-error bound\nfor the estimate of the missing outcome of any unit at time $\\mathbf{T}$. Our\nwork extends the recently growing literature on inference with adaptively\ncollected data by allowing for policies that pool across units, and also\ncompliments the matrix completion literature when the entries are revealed\nsequentially in an arbitrarily dependent manner based on prior observed data.",

    "abstract": "Let $N$ be the number of triangles in an Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi graph\n$\\mathcal{G}(n,p)$ on $n$ vertices with edge density $p=d/n,$ where $d>0$ is a\nfixed constant. It is well known that $N$ weakly converges to the Poisson\ndistribution with mean ${d^3}/{6}$ as $n\\rightarrow \\infty$. We address the\nupper tail problem for $N,$ namely, we investigate how fast $k$ must grow, so\nthat the probability of $\\{N\\ge k\\}$ is not well approximated anymore by the\ntail of the corresponding Poisson variable. Proving that the tail exhibits a\nsharp phase transition, we essentially show that the upper tail is governed by\nPoisson behavior only when $k^{1/3} \\log k< (\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}})^{2/3} \\log n$\n(sub-critical regime) as well as pin down the tail behavior when $k^{1/3} \\log\nk> (\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}})^{2/3} \\log n$ (super-critical regime). We further prove\na structure theorem, showing that the sub-critical upper tail behavior is\ndictated by the appearance of almost $k$ vertex-disjoint triangles whereas in\nthe supercritical regime, the excess triangles arise from a clique like\nstructure of size approximately $(6k)^{1/3}$. This settles the long-standing\nupper-tail problem in this case, answering a question of Aldous, complementing\na long sequence of works, spanning multiple decades, culminating in (Harel,\nMoussat, Samotij,'19) which analyzed the problem only in the regime $p\\gg\n\\frac{1}{n}.$ The proofs rely on several novel graph theoretical results which\ncould have other applications.",

Built upon an intrinsic connection\nbetween value-based methods and dynamic systems, we can directly use existing\nconvex testing conditions in control theory to derive various convergence\nresults for the aforementioned value-based methods.

Our analysis reveals some intriguing connections\nbetween feedback control systems and RL algorithms.

    "abstract": "Gaussian mixture models (GMM) are fundamental tools in statistical and data\nsciences. We study the moments of multivariate Gaussians and GMMs. The $d$-th\nmoment of an $n$-dimensional random variable is a symmetric $d$-way tensor of\nsize $n^d$, so working with moments naively is assumed to be prohibitively\nexpensive for $d>2$ and larger values of $n$. In this work, we develop theory\nand numerical methods for implicit computations with moment tensors of GMMs,\nreducing the computational and storage costs to $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ and\n$\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$, respectively, for general covariance matrices, and to\n$\\mathcal{O}(n)$ and $\\mathcal{O}(n)$, respectively, for diagonal ones. We\nderive concise analytic expressions for the moments in terms of symmetrized\ntensor products, relying on the correspondence between symmetric tensors and\nhomogeneous polynomials, and combinatorial identities involving Bell\npolynomials. The primary application of this theory is to estimating GMM\nparameters from a set of observations, when formulated as a moment-matching\noptimization problem. If there is a known and common covariance matrix, we also\nshow it is possible to debias the data observations, in which case the problem\nof estimating the unknown means reduces to symmetric CP tensor decomposition.\nNumerical results validate and illustrate the numerical efficiency of our\napproaches. This work potentially opens the door to the competitiveness of the\nmethod of moments as compared to expectation maximization methods for parameter\nestimation of GMMs.",
