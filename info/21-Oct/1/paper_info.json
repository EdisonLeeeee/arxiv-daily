    "abstract": "Algorithms for computing or approximating optimal decompositions for\ndecompositional parameters such as treewidth or clique-width have so far\ntraditionally been tailored to specific width parameters. Moreover, for\nmim-width, no efficient algorithms for computing good decompositions were\nknown, even under highly restrictive parameterizations. In this work we\nidentify F-branchwidth as a class of generic decompositional parameters that\ncan capture mim-width, treewidth, clique-width as well as other measures. We\nshow that while there is an infinite number of F-branchwidth parameters, only a\nhandful of these are asymptotically distinct. We then develop fixed-parameter\nand kernelization algorithms (under several structural parameterizations) that\ncan compute every possible F-branchwidth, providing a unifying framework that\ncan efficiently obtain near-optimal tree-decompositions, k-expressions, as well\nas optimal mim-width decompositions.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the feasibility of learning good representation space\nwith unlabeled client data in the federated scenario. Existing works trivially\ninherit the supervised federated learning methods, which does not apply to the\nmodel heterogeneity and has the potential risk of privacy exposure. To tackle\nthe problems above, we first identify that self-supervised contrastive local\ntraining is more robust against the non-i.i.d.-ness than the traditional\nsupervised learning paradigm. Then we propose a novel federated self-supervised\ncontrastive learning framework FLESD that supports architecture-agnostic local\ntraining and communication-efficient global aggregation. At each round of\ncommunication, the server first gathers a fraction of the clients' inferred\nsimilarity matrices on a public dataset. Then FLESD ensembles the similarity\nmatrices and trains the global model via similarity distillation. We verify the\neffectiveness of our proposed framework by a series of empirical experiments\nand show that FLESD has three main advantages over the existing methods: it\nhandles the model heterogeneity, is less prone to privacy leak, and is more\ncommunication-efficient. We will release the code of this paper in the future.",

To facilitate a more\npersonalized interaction with the policies, in this work, we propose an\nautomated privacy policy question answering assistant that extracts a summary\nin response to the input user query. This is a challenging task because users\narticulate their privacy-related questions in a very different language than\nthe legal language of the policy, making it difficult for the system to\nunderstand their inquiry. Moreover, existing annotated data in this domain are\nlimited. We address these problems by paraphrasing to bring the style and\nlanguage of the user's question closer to the language of privacy policies. Our\ncontent scoring module uses the existing in-domain data to find relevant\ninformation in the policy and incorporates it in a summary.

There are several ways to generate 3D\nmodels for applications such as gaming, media content for movies and TV, and 3D\nprinting among others. Since visualization is the primary purpose of these\nmethods of 3D model generation they lack the semantic information required for\napplications such as spatial data-mining, thematic queries, and geospatial\nsimulation and analysis. Therefore, there is a need to develop methods for\nmapping sematic information of new and existing 3D geometric models and their\nconversation to CityGML formats so it can be stored for future use. The\nconversion of must allows mapping of classes of objects with a higher\nLevel-Of-Detail (LOD) such as LOD3 and LOD4 which represent an urban city model\nin greater detail. A methodology of the conversion is developed and a prototype\nis implemented to validate the algorithms and the methods developed for this\nproject. The methods can be broadly categorized into three parts a) Extraction\nof geometric information; b) Segmentation of the model into various groups for\nsemantic mapping; c) Mapping of semantic information on the model. Topological\naspects are considered for the mesh segmentation to allow users to easily\nselect and map semantic information to the geometric model.

The volume and\nrate of this data collection can rapidly outpace researchers' abilities to\nprocess and analyze them. Recent advances in machine learning enable fast,\nsophisticated analysis of visual data, but have had limited success in the\noceanographic world due to lack of dataset standardization, sparse annotation\ntools, and insufficient formatting and aggregation of existing, expertly\ncurated imagery for use by data scientists. To address this need, we have built\nFathomNet, a public platform that makes use of existing (and future), expertly\ncurated data. Initial efforts have leveraged MBARI's Video Annotation and\nReference System and annotated deep sea video database, which has more than 7M\nannotations, 1M framegrabs, and 5k terms in the knowledgebase, with additional\ncontributions by National Geographic Society (NGS) and NOAA's Office of Ocean\nExploration and Research.

    "abstract": "Simulation-based imaging (SBI) is a blood flow imaging technique that\noptimally fits a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation to\nlow-resolution, noisy magnetic resonance (MR) flow data to produce a\nhigh-resolution velocity field. In this work, we study the effectivity of SBI\nin predicting wall shear stress (WSS) relative to standard magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI) postprocessing techniques using two synthetic numerical\nexperiments: flow through an idealized, two-dimensional stenotic vessel and a\nmodel of an adult aorta. In particular, we study the sensitivity of these two\napproaches with respect to the Reynolds number of the underlying flow, the\nresolution of the MRI data, and the noise in the MRI data. We found that the\nSBI WSS reconstruction: 1) is insensitive to Reynolds number over the range\nconsidered (Re $\\leq$ 1000), 2) improves as the amount of MRI data increases\nand provides accurate reconstructions with as little as three MRI voxels per\ndiameter, and 3) degrades linearly as the noise in the data increases with a\nslope determined by the resolution of the MRI data. We also consider the\nsensitivity of SBI to the resolution of the CFD mesh and found there is\nflexibility in the mesh used for SBI, although the WSS reconstruction becomes\nmore sensitive to other parameters, particularly the resolution of the MRI\ndata, for coarser meshes. This indicates a fundamental trade-off between scan\ntime (i.e., MRI data quality and resolution) and reconstruction time using SBI,\nwhich is inherently different than the trade-off between scan time and\nreconstruction quality observed in standard MRI postprocessing techniques.",

Previous works of MLL mainly\nfocused on the setting where the concept set is assumed to be fixed, while many\nreal-world applications require introducing new concepts into the set to meet\nnew demands. One common need is to refine the original coarse concepts and\nsplit them into finer-grained ones, where the refinement process typically\nbegins with limited labeled data for the finer-grained concepts. To address the\nneed, we formalize the problem into a special weakly supervised MLL problem to\nnot only learn the fine-grained concepts efficiently but also allow interactive\nqueries to strategically collect more informative annotations to further\nimprove the classifier. The key idea within our approach is to learn to assign\npseudo-labels to the unlabeled entries, and in turn leverage the pseudo-labels\nto train the underlying classifier and to inform a better query strategy.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our pseudo-label approach is able to\naccurately recover the missing ground truth, boosting the prediction\nperformance significantly over the baseline methods and facilitating a\ncompetitive active learning strategy.",

    "abstract": "Coded caching utilizes proper file subpacketization and coded delivery to\nmake full use of the multicast opportunities in content delivery, to alleviate\nfile transfer load in massive content delivery scenarios. Most existing work\nconsiders deterministic environments. An important practical topic is to\ncharacterize the impact of the uncertainty from user inactivity on coded\ncaching. We consider a one server cache-enabled network under homogeneous file\nand network settings in presence of user inactivity. Unlike random or\nprobabilistic caching studied in the literature, deterministic coded caching is\nconsidered, with the objective to minimize the worst-case backhaul load by\noptimizing the file subpacketization and the caching strategy. First, a coded\ncaching method is used, where each file is split into the same type of\nfragments labeled using sets with fixed cardinality, and the optimality of the\nselected cardinality is proved. Optimal file subpacketization by splitting the\nfile into multiple types of fragments labeled with multiple cardinalities is\nthen discussed. We show that the closed-form optimum turns out to be given by a\nfixed cardinality -- optimizing for user inactivity only affects file delivery,\ncache placement is not affected. A decentralized version is also discussed and\nanalyzed, where each user fills its storage independently at random without\ncentralized coordination, and user inactivity is taken into account in file\ndelivery. Simulation results show that the optimization based centralized coded\ncaching scheme provides performance comparable to the ideal scenario assuming\nfull knowledge of user inactivity in the placement phase, while decentralized\ncaching performs slightly worse against user inactivity.",

    "title": "Unified Shader Programming in C++",
    "abstract": "In real-time graphics, the strict separation of programming languages and\nenvironments for host (CPU) code and GPU code results in code duplication,\nsubtle compatibility bugs, and additional development and maintenance costs. In\ncontrast, popular general-purpose GPU (GPGPU) programming models like CUDA and\nC++ AMP avoid many of these issues by presenting unified programming\nenvironments where both host and GPU code are written in the same language, can\nbe in the same file, and share lexical scopes. To bring the benefits of unified\nprogramming to real-time graphics, this paper examines graphics-specific\nchallenges that complicate the development of such a unified model and explores\nhow to overcome them in a widely used programming language.\nWe observe that GPU code specialization, a key optimization in real-time\ngraphics, requires coordination between parameters that are\ncompile-time-constant in GPU code but are assigned values at runtime in host\ncode based on dynamic data. Current methods used to implement specialization do\nnot translate to a unified environment where host and GPU code share\ndeclarations of these parameters. Furthermore, this compile-time vs. runtime\ncoordination is not innately expressible in the popular languages used in this\ndomain.\nIn this paper, we create a unified environment for real-time graphics\nprogramming in C++ by co-opting existing features of the language and\nimplementing them with alternate semantics to express the services required.\nSpecifically, we co-opt C++ attributes and virtual functions, which enables us\nto provide first-class support for specialization in our unified system. By\nco-opting existing features, we enable programmers to use familiar C++\nprogramming techniques to write host and GPU code together, while still\nachieving efficient generated C++ and HLSL code via our source-to-source\ntranslator.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the problem of wireless beam tracking on mmWave bands with the\nassistance of camera images. In particular, based on the user's beam indices\nused and camera images taken in the trajectory, we predict the optimal beam\nindices in the next few time spots. To resolve this problem, we first\nreformulate the \"ViWi\" dataset in [1] to get rid of the image repetition\nproblem. Then we develop a deep learning approach and investigate various model\ncomponents to achieve the best performance. Finally, we explore whether, when,\nand how to use the image for better beam prediction. To answer this question,\nwe split the dataset into three clusters -- (LOS, light NLOS, serious\nNLOS)-like -- based on the standard deviation of the beam sequence. With\nexperiments we demonstrate that using the image indeed helps beam tracking\nespecially when the user is in serious NLOS, and the solution relies on\ncarefully-designed dataset for training a model. Generally speaking, including\nNLOS-like data for training a model does not benefit beam tracking of the user\nin LOS, but including light NLOS-like data for training a model benefits beam\ntracking of the user in serious NLOS.",

    "abstract": "Estimating Kullback Leibler (KL) divergence from samples of two distributions\nis essential in many machine learning problems. Variational methods using\nneural network discriminator have been proposed to achieve this task in a\nscalable manner. However, we noted that most of these methods using neural\nnetwork discriminators suffer from high fluctuations (variance) in estimates\nand instability in training. In this paper, we look at this issue from\nstatistical learning theory and function space complexity perspective to\nunderstand why this happens and how to solve it. We argue that the cause of\nthese pathologies is lack of control over the complexity of the neural network\ndiscriminator function and could be mitigated by controlling it. To achieve\nthis objective, we 1) present a novel construction of the discriminator in the\nReproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), 2) theoretically relate the error\nprobability bound of the KL estimates to the complexity of the discriminator in\nthe RKHS space, 3) present a scalable way to control the complexity (RKHS norm)\nof the discriminator for a reliable estimation of KL divergence, and 4) prove\nthe consistency of the proposed estimator.

    "abstract": "This work introduces a new approach to reduce the computational cost of\nsolving partial differential equations (PDEs) with convection-dominated\nsolutions: model reduction with implicit feature tracking. Traditional model\nreduction techniques use an affine subspace to reduce the dimensionality of the\nsolution manifold and, as a result, yield limited reduction and require\nextensive training due to the slowly decaying Kolmogorov $n$-width of\nconvection-dominated problems. The proposed approach circumvents the slowly\ndecaying $n$-width limitation by using a nonlinear approximation manifold\nsystematically defined by composing a low-dimensional affine space with a space\nof bijections of the underlying domain. Central to the implicit feature\ntracking approach is a residual minimization problem over the reduced nonlinear\nmanifold that simultaneously determines the reduced coordinates in the affine\nspace and the domain mapping that minimize the residual of the unreduced PDE\ndiscretization. The nonlinear trial manifold is constructed by using the\nproposed residual minimization formulation to determine domain mappings that\ncause parametrized features to align in a reference domain for a set of\ntraining parameters. Because the feature is stationary in the reference domain,\ni.e., the convective nature of solution removed, the snapshots are effectively\ncompressed to define an affine subspace. The space of domain mappings,\noriginally constructed using high-order finite elements, are also compressed in\na way that ensures the boundaries of the original domain are maintained.\nSeveral numerical experiments are provided, including transonic and supersonic,\ninviscid, compressible flows, to demonstrate the potential of the method to\nyield accurate approximations to convection-dominated problems with limited\ntraining.",

    "abstract": "Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) finds conflict-free paths for multiple agents\nfrom their respective start to goal locations. MAPF is challenging as the joint\nconfiguration space grows exponentially with respect to the number of agents.\nAmong MAPF planners, search-based methods, such as CBS and M*, effectively\nbypass the curse of dimensionality by employing a dynamically-coupled strategy:\nagents are planned in a fully decoupled manner at first, where potential\nconflicts between agents are ignored; and then agents either follow their\nindividual plans or are coupled together for planning to resolve the conflicts\nbetween them. In general, the number of conflicts to be resolved decides the\nrun time of these planners and most of the existing work focuses on how to\nefficiently resolve these conflicts. In this work, we take a different view and\naim to reduce the number of conflicts (and thus improve the overall search\nefficiency) by improving each agent's individual plan. By leveraging a Visual\nTransformer, we develop a learning-based single-agent planner, which plans for\na single agent while paying attention to both the structure of the map and\nother agents with whom conflicts may happen. We then develop a novel\nmulti-agent planner called LM* by integrating this learning-based single-agent\nplanner with M*. Our results show that for both \"seen\" and \"unseen\" maps, in\ncomparison with M*, LM* has fewer conflicts to be resolved and thus, runs\nfaster and enjoys higher success rates. We empirically show that MAPF solutions\ncomputed by LM* are near-optimal. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/lakshayvirmani/learning-assisted-mstar .",

    "title": "USIS: Unsupervised Semantic Image Synthesis",
    "abstract": "Semantic Image Synthesis (SIS) is a subclass of image-to-image translation\nwhere a photorealistic image is synthesized from a segmentation mask. SIS has\nmostly been addressed as a supervised problem. However, state-of-the-art\nmethods depend on a huge amount of labeled data and cannot be applied in an\nunpaired setting. On the other hand, generic unpaired image-to-image\ntranslation frameworks underperform in comparison, because they color-code\nsemantic layouts and feed them to traditional convolutional networks, which\nthen learn correspondences in appearance instead of semantic content. In this\ninitial work, we propose a new Unsupervised paradigm for Semantic Image\nSynthesis (USIS) as a first step towards closing the performance gap between\npaired and unpaired settings. Notably, the framework deploys a SPADE generator\nthat learns to output images with visually separable semantic classes using a\nself-supervised segmentation loss. Furthermore, in order to match the color and\ntexture distribution of real images without losing high-frequency information,\nwe propose to use whole image wavelet-based discrimination. We test our\nmethodology on 3 challenging datasets and demonstrate its ability to generate\nmultimodal photorealistic images with an improved quality in the unpaired\nsetting.",

    "abstract": "Data modeling is a process of developing a model to design and develop a data\nsystem that supports an organization s various business processes. A conceptual\ndata model represents a technology-independent specification of structure of\ndata to be stored within a database. The model aims at providing richer\nexpressiveness and incorporating a set of semantics to (a) support the design,\ncontrol, and integrity parts of the data stored in data management structures\nand (b) coordinate viewing of connections and ideas on a database. The\ndescribed structure of the data is often represented in an entity-relationship\n(ER) model, which was one of the first data-modeling techniques and is likely\nto continue to be a popular way of characterizing entity classes, attributes\nand relationships. This paper is an attempt to examine the basic ER modeling\nnotions to analyze the concepts to which they refer as well as ways to\nrepresent them. In such a mission, we apply a new modeling methodology\n(thinging machine; TM) to ER in terms of its fundamental building constructs,\nrepresentation entities, relationships and attributes. The goal of this venture\nis to further the understanding of data models and enrich their semantics.\nThree specific contributions to modeling in this context are incorporated: (a)\nusing the TM model s five generic actions to inject processing in the ER\nstructure; (b) relating the single ontological element of TM modeling (i.e., a\nthing/machine or thimac) to ER entities and relationships; and (c) proposing a\nhigh-level integrated, extended ER model that includes structural and\ntime-oriented notions (e.g., events or behavior).",

    "abstract": "Symbols representing abstract states such as \"dish in dishwasher\" or \"cup on\ntable\" allow robots to reason over long horizons by hiding details unnecessary\nfor high level planning. Current methods for learning to identify symbolic\nstates in visual data require large amounts of labeled training data, but\nmanually annotating such datasets is prohibitively expensive due to the\ncombinatorial number of predicates in images. We propose a novel method for\nautomatically labeling symbolic states in large-scale video activity datasets\nby exploiting known pre- and post-conditions of actions. This automatic\nlabeling scheme only requires weak supervision in the form of an action label\nthat describes which action is demonstrated in each video. We apply our\nframework to an existing large-scale human activity dataset. We train predicate\nclassifiers to identify symbolic relationships between objects when prompted\nwith object bounding boxes and achieve 0.93 test accuracy.

As a result, it can be hard to\nidentify what the model actually \"believes\" about the world, making it\nsusceptible to inconsistent behavior and simple errors. Our goal is to reduce\nthese problems. Our approach is to embed a PTLM in a broader system that also\nincludes an evolving, symbolic memory of beliefs -- a BeliefBank -- that\nrecords but then may modify the raw PTLM answers. We describe two mechanisms to\nimprove belief consistency in the overall system. First, a reasoning component\n-- a weighted MaxSAT solver -- revises beliefs that significantly clash with\nothers. Second, a feedback component issues future queries to the PTLM using\nknown beliefs as context. We show that, in a controlled experimental setting,\nthese two mechanisms result in more consistent beliefs in the overall system,\nimproving both the accuracy and consistency of its answers over time. This is\nsignificant as it is a first step towards PTLM-based architectures with a\nsystematic notion of belief, enabling them to construct a more coherent picture\nof the world, and improve over time without model retraining.",

We tackle this planning issue by extending the policy gradient theory\nto policy updates with respect to any state density. Under these generalized\npolicy updates, we show convergence to optimality under a necessary and\nsufficient condition on the updates' state densities, and thereby solve the\naforementioned planning issue. We also prove asymptotic convergence rates that\nsignificantly improve those in the policy gradient literature.\nTo implement the principles prescribed by our theory, we propose an agent, Dr\nJekyll & Mr Hyde (JH), with a double personality: Dr Jekyll purely exploits\nwhile Mr Hyde purely explores. JH's independent policies allow to record two\nseparate replay buffers: one on-policy (Dr Jekyll's) and one off-policy (Mr\nHyde's), and therefore to update JH's models with a mixture of on-policy and\noff-policy updates. More than an algorithm, JH defines principles for\nactor-critic algorithms to satisfy the requirements we identify in our\nanalysis. We extensively test on finite MDPs where JH demonstrates a superior\nability to recover from converging to a suboptimal policy without impairing its\nspeed of convergence.

    "abstract": "A convolutional neural network (ConvNet) is usually trained and then tested\nusing images drawn from the same distribution. To generalize a ConvNet to\nvarious tasks often requires a complete training dataset that consists of\nimages drawn from different tasks. In most scenarios, it is nearly impossible\nto collect every possible representative dataset as a priori. The new data may\nonly become available after the ConvNet is deployed in clinical practice.\nConvNet, however, may generate artifacts on out-of-distribution testing\nsamples. In this study, we present Targeted Gradient Descent (TGD), a novel\nfine-tuning method that can extend a pre-trained network to a new task without\nrevisiting data from the previous task while preserving the knowledge acquired\nfrom previous training. To a further extent, the proposed method also enables\nonline learning of patient-specific data. The method is built on the idea of\nreusing a pre-trained ConvNet's redundant kernels to learn new knowledge. We\ncompare the performance of TGD to several commonly used training approaches on\nthe task of Positron emission tomography (PET) image denoising. Results from\nclinical images show that TGD generated results on par with\ntraining-from-scratch while significantly reducing data preparation and network\ntraining time.

Using this grid\nmodel, the state estimation is formulated as a Linear Programming (LP) problem\nwhose solution includes a sparse vector of noise terms, which localizes\nsuspicious wrong status and bad data separately.

    "abstract": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric condition affecting\nnearly a quarter of the United States war veterans who return from war zones.\nTreatment for PTSD typically consists of a combination of in-session therapy\nand medication. However; patients often experience their most severe PTSD\nsymptoms outside of therapy sessions. Mobile health applications may address\nthis gap, but their effectiveness is limited by the current gap in continuous\nmonitoring and detection capabilities enabling timely intervention. The goal of\nthis article is to develop a novel method to detect hyperarousal events using\nphysiological and activity-based machine learning algorithms. Physiological\ndata including heart rate and body acceleration as well as self-reported\nhyperarousal events were collected using a tool developed for commercial\noff-the-shelf wearable devices from 99 United States veterans diagnosed with\nPTSD over several days. The data were used to develop four machine learning\nalgorithms: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression and\nXGBoost. The XGBoost model had the best performance in detecting onset of PTSD\nsymptoms with over 83% accuracy and an AUC of 0.70. Post-hoc SHapley Additive\nexPlanations (SHAP) additive explanation analysis showed that algorithm\npredictions were correlated with average heart rate, minimum heart rate and\naverage body acceleration. Findings show promise in detecting onset of PTSD\nsymptoms which could be the basis for developing remote and continuous\nmonitoring systems for PTSD. Such systems may address a vital gap in\njust-in-time interventions for PTSD self-management outside of scheduled\nclinical appointments.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) provides a strategy for improving\nmachine learning performance in data-rich (target) domains where ground truth\nlabels are inaccessible but can be found in related (source) domains. In cases\nwhere meta-domain information such as label distributions is available, weak\nsupervision can further boost performance. We propose a novel framework, CALDA,\nto tackle these two problems. CALDA synergistically combines the principles of\ncontrastive learning and adversarial learning to robustly support multi-source\nUDA (MS-UDA) for time series data. Similar to prior methods, CALDA utilizes\nadversarial learning to align source and target feature representations. Unlike\nprior approaches, CALDA additionally leverages cross-source label information\nacross domains. CALDA pulls examples with the same label close to each other,\nwhile pushing apart examples with different labels, reshaping the space through\ncontrastive learning. Unlike prior contrastive adaptation methods, CALDA\nrequires neither data augmentation nor pseudo labeling, which may be more\nchallenging for time series. We empirically validate our proposed approach.\nBased on results from human activity recognition, electromyography, and\nsynthetic datasets, we find utilizing cross-source information improves\nperformance over prior time series and contrastive methods. Weak supervision\nfurther improves performance, even in the presence of noise, allowing CALDA to\noffer generalizable strategies for MS-UDA. Code is available at:\nhttps://github.com/floft/calda",

However, its\nvolatility and brand new trading mode have made it challenging to devising an\nacceptable automatically-generating strategy. This study proposes a framework\nfor automatic high-frequency bitcoin transactions based on a deep reinforcement\nlearning algorithm-proximal policy optimization (PPO). The framework creatively\nregards the transaction process as actions, returns as awards and prices as\nstates to align with the idea of reinforcement learning. It compares advanced\nmachine learning-based models for static price predictions including support\nvector machine (SVM), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), long short-term memory\n(LSTM), temporal convolutional network (TCN), and Transformer by applying them\nto the real-time bitcoin price and the experimental results demonstrate that\nLSTM outperforms. Then an automatically-generating transaction strategy is\nconstructed building on PPO with LSTM as the basis to construct the policy.\nExtensive empirical studies validate that the proposed method performs\nsuperiorly to various common trading strategy benchmarks for a single financial\nproduct. The approach is able to trade bitcoins in a simulated environment with\nsynchronous data and obtains a 31.67% more return than that of the best\nbenchmark, improving the benchmark by 12.75%. The proposed framework can earn\nexcess returns through both the period of volatility and surge, which opens the\ndoor to research on building a single cryptocurrency trading strategy based on\ndeep learning.

    "abstract": "A closer integration of machine learning and relational databases has gained\nsteam in recent years due to the fact that the training data to many ML tasks\nis the results of a relational query (most often, a join-select query). In a\nfederated setting, this poses an additional challenge, that the tables are held\nby different parties as their private data, and the parties would like to train\nthe model without having to use a trusted third party. Existing work has only\nconsidered the case where the training data is stored in a flat table that has\nbeen vertically partitioned, which corresponds to a simple PK-PK join. In this\npaper, we describe secure protocols to compute the join results of multiple\ntables conforming to a general foreign-key acyclic schema, and how to feed the\nresults in secret-shared form to a secure ML toolbox. Furthermore, existing\nsecure ML systems reveal the PKs in the join results. We strengthen the privacy\nprotection to higher levels and achieve zero information leakage beyond the\ntrained model.

The proposed formulation\nis locally conservative. A mixed-type DG method in conjunction with the\nstress-velocity formulation is employed for the Stokes equations, where the\nsymmetry of stress is strongly imposed. The staggered DG method is exploited to\ndiscretize the Darcy equations. As such, the discrete formulation can be easily\nadapted to account for the Beavers-Joseph-Saffman interface conditions without\nintroducing additional variables. Importantly, the continuity of normal\nvelocity is satisfied exactly at the discrete level. A rigorous convergence\nanalysis is performed for all the variables. Then we devise and analyze a\ndomain decomposition method via the use of Robin-type interface boundary\nconditions, which allows us to solve the Stokes subproblem and the Darcy\nsubproblem sequentially with low computational costs. The convergence of the\nproposed iterative method is analyzed rigorously. In particular, the proposed\niterative method also works for very small viscosity coefficient.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to a growing interest\nin applying RL to classical planning domains or applying classical planning\nmethods to some complex RL domains. However, the long-horizon goal-based\nproblems found in classical planning lead to sparse rewards for RL, making\ndirect application inefficient. In this paper, we propose to leverage\ndomain-independent heuristic functions commonly used in the classical planning\nliterature to improve the sample efficiency of RL. These classical heuristics\nact as dense reward generators to alleviate the sparse-rewards issue and enable\nour RL agent to learn domain-specific value functions as residuals on these\nheuristics, making learning easier. Correct application of this technique\nrequires consolidating the discounted metric used in RL and the non-discounted\nmetric used in heuristics. We implement the value functions using Neural Logic\nMachines, a neural network architecture designed for grounded first-order logic\ninputs. We demonstrate on several classical planning domains that using\nclassical heuristics for RL allows for good sample efficiency compared to\nsparse-reward RL.

There is a\ngrowing interest in the integration of user's queries into video summarization,\nor query-driven video summarization. This video summarization method predicts a\nconcise synopsis of the original video based on the user query, which is\ncommonly represented by the input text. However, two inherent problems exist in\nthis query-driven way. First, the query text might not be enough to describe\nthe exact and diverse needs of the user. Second, the user cannot edit once the\nsummaries are produced, limiting this summarization technique's practical\nvalue. We assume the needs of the user should be subtle and need to be adjusted\ninteractively. To solve these two problems, we propose a novel IntentVizor\nframework, which is an interactive video summarization framework guided by\ngenric multi-modality queries. The input query that describes the user's needs\nis not limited to text but also the video snippets. We further conclude these\nmulti-modality finer-grained queries as user `intent', which is a newly\nproposed concept in this paper. This intent is interpretable, interactable, and\nbetter quantifies/describes the user's needs. To be more specific, We use a set\nof intents to represent the inputs of users to design our new interactive\nvisual analytic interface. Users can interactively control and adjust these\nmixed-initiative intents to obtain a more satisfying summary of this newly\nproposed interface. Also, as algorithms help users achieve their summarization\ngoal via video understanding, we propose two novel intent/scoring networks\nbased on the slow-fast feature for our algorithm part.

The standard way to implement\ndifferential privacy is to inject a sufficient amount of noise into the data.\nHowever, in addition to other limitations of differential privacy, this process\nof adding noise will affect data accuracy and utility. Another approach to\nenable privacy in data sharing is based on the concept of synthetic data. The\ngoal of synthetic data is to create an as-realistic-as-possible dataset, one\nthat not only maintains the nuances of the original data, but does so without\nrisk of exposing sensitive information. The combination of differential privacy\nwith synthetic data has been suggested as a best-of-both-worlds solutions. In\nthis work, we propose the first noisefree method to construct differentially\nprivate synthetic data; we do this through a mechanism called \"private\nsampling\". Using the Boolean cube as benchmark data model, we derive explicit\nbounds on accuracy and privacy of the constructed synthetic data. The key\nmathematical tools are hypercontractivity, duality, and empirical processes. A\ncore ingredient of our private sampling mechanism is a rigorous \"marginal\ncorrection\" method, which has the remarkable property that importance\nreweighting can be utilized to exactly match the marginals of the sample to the\nmarginals of the population.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel method for generating artistic images that\nexpress particular affective states. Leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning\nmethods for visual generation (through generative adversarial networks),\nsemantic models from OpenAI, and the annotated dataset of the visual art\nencyclopedia WikiArt, our AffectGAN model is able to generate images based on\nspecific or broad semantic prompts and intended affective outcomes. A small\ndataset of 32 images generated by AffectGAN is annotated by 50 participants in\nterms of the particular emotion they elicit, as well as their quality and\nnovelty. Results show that for most instances the intended emotion used as a\nprompt for image generation matches the participants' responses. This\nsmall-scale study brings forth a new vision towards blending affective\ncomputing with computational creativity, enabling generative systems with\nintentionality in terms of the emotions they wish their output to elicit.",

By terrain aware, we mean the\nrobot can use information on terrain slope and friction cone as supplied by\nstate-of-the-art mapping and trajectory planning algorithms. The process starts\nwith abstracting from the full dynamics of a Cassie 3D bipedal robot, an exact\nlow-dimensional representation of its centroidal dynamics, parameterized by\nangular momentum. Under a piecewise planar terrain assumption, and the\nelimination of terms for the angular momentum about the robot's center of mass,\nthe centroidal dynamics become linear and has dimension four. Four-step-horizon\nmodel predictive control (MPC) of the centroidal dynamics provides step-to-step\nfoot placement commands. Importantly, we also include the intra-step dynamics\nat 10 ms intervals so that realistic terrain-aware constraints on robot's\nevolution can be imposed in the MPC formulation. The output of the MPC is\ndirectly implemented on Cassie through the method of virtual constraints. In\nexperiments, we validate the performance of our control strategy for the robot\non inclined and stationary terrain, both indoors on a treadmill and outdoors on\na hill.",

Towards solving this problem, we propose to Harmonize optimization\nmetrics in Learned Image Compression (HLIC) using online loss function\nadaptation by reinforcement learning.

    "abstract": "The standard ML methodology assumes that the test samples are derived from a\nset of pre-observed classes used in the training phase. Where the model\nextracts and learns useful patterns to detect new data samples belonging to the\nsame data classes. However, in certain applications such as Network Intrusion\nDetection Systems, it is challenging to obtain data samples for all attack\nclasses that the model will most likely observe in production. ML-based NIDSs\nface new attack traffic known as zero-day attacks, that are not used in the\ntraining of the learning models due to their non-existence at the time. In this\npaper, a zero-shot learning methodology has been proposed to evaluate the ML\nmodel performance in the detection of zero-day attack scenarios. In the\nattribute learning stage, the ML models map the network data features to\ndistinguish semantic attributes from known attack (seen) classes. In the\ninference stage, the models are evaluated in the detection of zero-day attack\n(unseen) classes by constructing the relationships between known attacks and\nzero-day attacks. A new metric is defined as Zero-day Detection Rate, which\nmeasures the effectiveness of the learning model in the inference stage. The\nresults demonstrate that while the majority of the attack classes do not\nrepresent significant risks to organisations adopting an ML-based NIDS in a\nzero-day attack scenario. However, for certain attack groups identified in this\npaper, such systems are not effective in applying the learnt attributes of\nattack behaviour to detect them as malicious. Further Analysis was conducted\nusing the Wasserstein Distance technique to measure how different such attacks\nare from other attack types used in the training of the ML model. The results\ndemonstrate that sophisticated attacks with a low zero-day detection rate have\na significantly distinct feature distribution compared to the other attack\nclasses.",

    "title": "Towards Understanding Trends Manipulation in Pakistan Twitter",
    "abstract": "The rapid adoption of online social media platforms has transformed the way\nof communication and interaction. On these platforms, discussions in the form\nof trending topics provide a glimpse of events happening around the world in\nreal-time. Also, these trends are used for political campaigns, public\nawareness, and brand promotions. Consequently, these trends are sensitive to\nmanipulation by malicious users who aim to mislead the mass audience. In this\narticle, we identify and study the characteristics of users involved in the\nmanipulation of Twitter trends in Pakistan. We propose 'Manipify', a framework\nfor automatic detection and analysis of malicious users for Twitter trends. Our\nframework consists of three distinct modules: i) user classifier, ii) hashtag\nclassifier, and ii) trend analyzer. The user classifier introduces a novel\napproach to automatically detect manipulators using tweet content and user\nbehaviour features. Also, the module classifies human and bot users. Next, the\nhashtag classifier categorizes trending hashtags into six categories assisting\nin examining manipulators behaviour across different categories. Finally, the\ntrend analyzer module examines users, hashtags, and tweets for hashtag reach,\nlinguistic features and user behaviour. Our user classifier module achieves\n0.91 accuracy in classifying the manipulators. We further test Manipify on the\ndataset comprising of 665 trending hashtags with 5.4 million tweets and 1.9\nmillion users. The analysis of trends reveals that the trending panel is mostly\ndominated by political hashtags. In addition, our results show a higher\ncontribution of human accounts in trend manipulation as compared to bots.\nFurthermore, we present two case studies of hashtag-wars and anti-state\npropaganda to implicate the real-world application of our research.",

Recently many studies investigated machine learning monitoring\nmethods especially based on Deep Learning networks focusing mostly on detecting\nbearing faults; however, none of them addressed bearing fault severity\nclassification for early fault diagnosis with high enough accuracy. 1D\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have indeed achieved good performance for\ndetecting RM bearing faults from raw vibration and current signals but did not\nclassify fault severity. Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated the\nlimitation in terms of learning capability of conventional CNNs attributed to\nthe basic underlying linear neuron model. Recently, Operational Neural Networks\n(ONNs) were proposed to enhance the learning capability of CNN by introducing\nnon-linear neuron models and further heterogeneity in the network\nconfiguration. In this study, we propose 1D Self-organized ONNs (Self-ONNs)\nwith generative neurons for bearing fault severity classification and providing\ncontinuous condition monitoring. Experimental results over the benchmark\nNSF/IMS bearing vibration dataset using both x- and y-axis vibration signals\nfor inner race and rolling element faults demonstrate that the proposed 1D\nSelf-ONNs achieve significant performance gap against the state-of-the-art (1D\nCNNs) with similar computational complexity.",

    "abstract": "Recent breakthroughs in graph streaming have led to the design of single-pass\nsemi-streaming algorithms for various graph coloring problems such as\n$(\\Delta+1)$-coloring, degeneracy-coloring, coloring triangle-free graphs, and\nothers. These algorithms are all randomized in crucial ways and whether or not\nthere is any deterministic analogue of them has remained an important open\nquestion in this line of work.\nWe settle this fundamental question by proving that there is no deterministic\nsingle-pass semi-streaming algorithm that given a graph $G$ with maximum degree\n$\\Delta$, can output a proper coloring of $G$ using any number of colors which\nis sub-exponential in $\\Delta$. Our proof is based on analyzing the multi-party\ncommunication complexity of a related communication game, using random graph\ntheory type arguments that may be of independent interest.\nWe complement our lower bound by showing that just one extra pass over the\ninput allows one to recover an $O(\\Delta^2)$ coloring via a deterministic\nsemi-streaming algorithm. This result is further extended to an $O(\\Delta)$\ncoloring in $O(\\log{\\Delta})$ passes even in dynamic streams.",

In the\nspecial case of circular drawings the approximation factor is 8 (no extra\nterm), this improves upon the 10-approximation of Fink et al. (Bundled\ncrossings in embedded graphs, Proc.

    "abstract": "In translating text where sentiment is the main message, human translators\ngive particular attention to sentiment-carrying words. The reason is that an\nincorrect translation of such words would miss the fundamental aspect of the\nsource text, i.e. the author's sentiment. In the online world, MT systems are\nextensively used to translate User-Generated Content (UGC) such as reviews,\ntweets, and social media posts, where the main message is often the author's\npositive or negative attitude towards the topic of the text. It is important in\nsuch scenarios to accurately measure how far an MT system can be a reliable\nreal-life utility in transferring the correct affect message. This paper\ntackles an under-recognised problem in the field of machine translation\nevaluation which is judging to what extent automatic metrics concur with the\ngold standard of human evaluation for a correct translation of sentiment. We\nevaluate the efficacy of conventional quality metrics in spotting a\nmistranslation of sentiment, especially when it is the sole error in the MT\noutput. We propose a numerical `sentiment-closeness' measure appropriate for\nassessing the accuracy of a translated affect message in UGC text by an MT\nsystem. We will show that incorporating this sentiment-aware measure can\nsignificantly enhance the correlation of some available quality metrics with\nthe human judgement of an accurate translation of sentiment.",

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) are expected to play an important\nrole in future wireless communication systems. These surfaces typically rely on\ntheir reflection beamforming codebooks to reflect and focus the signal on the\ntarget receivers. Prior work has mainly considered pre-defined RIS beamsteering\ncodebooks that do not adapt to the environment and hardware and lead to large\nbeam training overhead. In this work, a novel deep reinforcement learning based\nframework is developed to efficiently construct the RIS reflection beam\ncodebook. This framework adopts a multi-level design approach that transfers\nthe learning between the multiple RIS subarrays, which speeds up the learning\nconvergence and highly reduces the computational complexity for large RIS\nsurfaces. The proposed approach is generic for co-located/distributed RIS\nsurfaces with arbitrary array geometries and with stationary/non-stationary\nchannels. Further, the developed solution does not require explicitly channel\nknowledge and adapts the codebook beams to the surrounding environment, user\ndistribution, and hardware characteristics. Simulation results show that the\nproposed learning framework can learn optimized interaction codebooks within\nreasonable iterations. Besides, with only 6 beams, the learned codebook\noutperforms a 256-beam DFT codebook, which significantly reduces the beam\ntraining overhead.",

With CrossCLR, we present a contrastive loss that fixes this\nissue. Moreover, we define sets of highly related samples in terms of their\ninput embeddings and exclude them from the negative samples to avoid issues\nwith false negatives. We show that these principles consistently improve the\nquality of the learned embeddings.

    "abstract": "Temporal expressions in text play a significant role in language\nunderstanding and correctly identifying them is fundamental to various\nretrieval and natural language processing systems. Previous works have slowly\nshifted from rule-based to neural architectures, capable of tagging expressions\nwith higher accuracy. However, neural models can not yet distinguish between\ndifferent expression types at the same level as their rule-based counterparts.\nn this work, we aim to identify the most suitable transformer architecture for\njoint temporal tagging and type classification, as well as, investigating the\neffect of semi-supervised training on the performance of these systems. After\nstudying variants of token classification and encoder-decoder architectures, we\nultimately present a transformer encoder-decoder model using RoBERTa language\nmodel as our best performing system. By supplementing training resources with\nweakly labeled data from rule-based systems, our model surpasses previous works\nin temporal tagging and type classification, especially on rare classes.\nAdditionally, we make the code and pre-trained experiment publicly available",

They represent features that are perceived by humans about a place.\nWe consider the extent to which this knowledge becomes available to\nparticipants, using interactions with locations and other nodes.

In this context, mobile Opportunistic Networks (ONs) are one\nof the key paradigms to support, in a self-organising and decentralised manner,\nthe growth of data generated by localized interactions between users mobile\ndevices, and between them and nearby devices such as IoT nodes. In ONs, the\nspontaneous collaboration among mobile devices is exploited to disseminate data\ntoward interested users. However, the limited resources and knowledge available\nat each node, and the vast amount of data available, make it difficult to\ndevise efficient schemes to accomplish this task. Recent solutions propose to\nequip each device with data filtering methods derived from human data\nprocessing schemes, known as Cognitive Heuristics, i.e. very effective methods\nused by the brain to quickly drop useless information, while keeping the most\nrelevant one. These solutions can become less effective when facing dynamic\nscenarios or situations where nodes cannot fully collaborate. One of the\nreasons is that the solutions proposed so far do not take take into account the\nsocial structure of the environment where the nodes move in. To be more\neffective, the selection of information performed by each node should take into\nconsideration this dimension of the environment. In this paper we propose a\nsocial-based data dissemination scheme, based on the cognitive Social Circle\nHeuristic. This evaluation method exploits the structure of the social\nenvironment to make inferences about the relevance of discovered information.\nWe show how the Social Circle Heuristic, coupled with a cognitive-based\ncommunity detection scheme, can be exploited to design an effective data\ndissemination algorithm for ONs.

However, the increased number of RIS elements results in the\nhigh overhead for channel acquisition and the non-negligible power consumption.\nTherefore, how to improve the system capacity with limited RIS elements is\nessential. Unlike the classical regular RIS whose elements are arranged on a\nregular grid, in this paper, we propose an irregular RIS structure. The key\nidea is to irregularly configure a given number of RIS elements on an enlarged\nsurface, which provides extra spatial degrees of freedom compared with the\nregular RIS. In this way, the received signal power can be enhanced, and thus\nthe system capacity can be improved. Then, we formulate a joint topology and\nprecoding optimization problem to maximize the capacity for irregular RIS-aided\ncommunication systems. Accordingly, a joint optimization algorithm with low\ncomplexity is proposed to alternately optimize the RIS topology and the\nprecoding design. Particularly, a tabu search-based method is used to design\nthe irregular RIS topology, and a neighbor extraction-based cross-entropy\nmethod is introduced to optimize the precoding design. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that, subject to the constraint of limited RIS elements, the\nproposed irregular RIS can significantly enhance the system capacity.",

Neuromorphic Vision Sensors (NVS) are\nbio-inspired sensors that mimic the working of the human eye. Unlike\nconventional frame-based cameras, these sensors capture a stream of\nasynchronous 'events' that pose multiple advantages over the former, like high\ndynamic range, low latency, low power consumption, and reduced motion blur.\nHowever, these advantages come at a high cost, as the event camera data\ntypically contains more noise and has low resolution. Moreover, as event-based\ncameras can only capture the relative changes in brightness of a scene, event\ndata do not contain usual visual information (like texture and color) as\navailable in video data from normal cameras. So, moving object detection in\nevent-based cameras becomes an extremely challenging task.

The statistical characterization\nof the reaction-diffusion process is difficult because the reversible\nbi-molecular reaction of NTs and receptors renders the system nonlinear.\nConsequently, existing models for the receptor occupancy in the synaptic cleft\nrely on simplifying assumptions and approximations which limit their practical\napplicability.

    "abstract": "We investigate the extent to which modern, neural language models are\nsusceptible to syntactic priming, the phenomenon where the syntactic structure\nof a sentence makes the same structure more probable in a follow-up sentence.\nWe explore how priming can be used to study the nature of the syntactic\nknowledge acquired by these models. We introduce a novel metric and release\nPrime-LM, a large corpus where we control for various linguistic factors which\ninteract with priming strength. We find that recent large Transformer models\nindeed show evidence of syntactic priming, but also that the syntactic\ngeneralisations learned by these models are to some extent modulated by\nsemantic information. We report surprisingly strong priming effects when\npriming with multiple sentences, each with different words and meaning but with\nidentical syntactic structure. We conclude that the syntactic priming paradigm\nis a highly useful, additional tool for gaining insights into the capacities of\nlanguage models.",

    "abstract": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) sometimes needs a large amount of data to\nconverge in the training procedure and in some cases, each action of the agent\nmay produce regret. This barrier naturally motivates different data sets or\nenvironment owners to cooperate to share their knowledge and train their agents\nmore efficiently. However, it raises privacy concerns if we directly merge the\nraw data from different owners. To solve this problem, we proposed a new Deep\nNeural Network (DNN) architecture with both global NN and local NN, and a\ndistributed training framework. We allow the global weights to be updated by\nall the collaborator agents while the local weights are only updated by the\nagent they belong to. In this way, we hope the global weighs can share the\ncommon knowledge among these collaborators while the local NN can keep the\nspecialized properties and ensure the agent to be compatible with its specific\nenvironment.

Several attempts have been made to\nconstruct a better neighborhood for high dimensional data, like texts, by using\ngenerative autoencoders.

Among attacks\nregularized by $\\ell_p$ norm, $\\ell_0$-attack aims to modify as few pixels as\npossible. Nevertheless, the problem is nontrivial since it generally requires\nto optimize the shape along with the texture simultaneously, which is an\nNP-hard problem. To address this issue, we propose a novel method of\nAdversarial Semantic Contour (ASC) guided by object contour as prior. With this\nprior, we reduce the searching space to accelerate the $\\ell_0$ optimization,\nand also introduce more semantic information which should affect the detectors\nmore. Based on the contour, we optimize the selection of modified pixels via\nsampling and their colors with gradient descent alternately. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our proposed ASC outperforms the most commonly\nmanually designed patterns (e.g., square patches and grids) on task of\ndisappearing.

We investigate the interactions between these two tasks in\nthe specific information content service domain. We propose first integrating\nthe user's behaviors in search and recommendation into a heterogeneous behavior\nsequence, then utilizing a joint model for handling both tasks based on the\nunified sequence.

We motivate this via settings\nwhere the items themselves correspond to user ad slots or task workers with\nattributes such as race and gender on which the principal seeks to achieve\ndemographic parity. We consider the following question: When an agent expresses\ndiversity constraints into an allocation rule, is the allocation of other\nagents hurt significantly? If this happens, the cost of introducing such\nconstraints is disproportionately borne by agents who do not benefit from\ndiversity. We codify this via two desiderata capturing robustness. These are no\nnegative externality -- other agents are not hurt -- and monotonicity -- the\nagent enforcing the constraint does not see a large increase in value. We show\nin a formal sense that the Nash Welfare rule that maximizes product of agent\nvalues is uniquely positioned to be robust when diversity constraints are\nintroduced, while almost all other natural allocation rules fail this\ncriterion. We also show that the guarantees achieved by Nash Welfare are nearly\noptimal within a widely studied class of allocation rules.

The\nproblem of computing the optimal reeling speed for the sake of maximizing the\naverage cycle power is considered. The difficulty stems from two aspects: 1)\nthe uncertain, time- (and space-) varying nature of wind speed, which can not\nbe measured accurately, and 2) the need to consider, in the same optimization\nproblem, the different operational phases of the power cycle. A new,\nmodel-based approach that solves this problem is proposed. In the design phase,\na model of the AWE system is employed to collect data pertaining to the cycle\npower obtained with various reel-in/reel-out speed pairs, assuming known wind\nspeed. Then, a nonlinear map, identified from these data, is used as cost\nfunction in an optimization program that computes the best reel-in and -out\nspeed pairs for each wind speed. Finally, the optimization results are\nexploited to infer the link between optimal reeling speed and tether force,\nwhich are both measured with high accuracy. Such a link is used to design a\nfeedback controller that computes the reeling speed based on the measured\ntether force, in order to converge on the optimal force-speed manifold.\nSimulation results with a realistic model illustrate the effectiveness of the\napproach.",

First, we show the robustness of the metric through randomization\nexperiments, and then use Focus to evaluate and compare three popular\nexplainability techniques using multiple architectures and datasets. Our\nresults find LRP and GradCAM to be consistent and reliable, the former being\nmore accurate for high performing models, while the latter remains most\ncompetitive even when applied to poorly performing models. Finally, we identify\na strong relation between Focus and factors like model architecture and task,\nunveiling a new unsupervised approach for the assessment of models.",

    "abstract": "Manual material handling tasks have the potential to be highly unsafe from an\nergonomic viewpoint. Safety inspections to monitor body postures can help\nmitigate ergonomic risks of material handling. However, the real effect of\nawkward muscle movements, strains, and excessive forces that may result in an\ninjury may not be identified by external cues. This paper evaluates the ability\nof surface electromyogram (EMG)-based systems together with machine learning\nalgorithms to automatically detect body movements that may harm muscles in\nmaterial handling. The analysis utilized a lifting equation developed by the\nU.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). This\nequation determines a Recommended Weight Limit, which suggests the maximum\nacceptable weight that a healthy worker can lift and carry as well as a Lifting\nIndex value to assess the risk extent. Four different machine learning models,\nnamely Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Random\nForest are developed to classify the risk assessments calculated based on the\nNIOSH lifting equation. The sensitivity of the models to various parameters is\nalso evaluated to find the best performance using each algorithm. Results\nindicate that Decision Tree models have the potential to predict the risk level\nwith close to 99.35% accuracy.",

Unlike the standard\nauthentication schemes where one central authority authenticates users one by\none, group authentication can handle the authentication process at once for all\nmembers of the group. The recently presented group authentication algorithms\nmainly exploit Lagrange's polynomial interpolation along with elliptic curve\ngroups over finite fields. As a fresh approach, this work suggests use of\nlinear spaces for group authentication and key establishment for a group of any\nsize. The approach with linear spaces introduces a reduced computation and\ncommunication load to establish a common shared key among the group members.\nThe advantages of using vector spaces make the proposed method applicable to\nenergy and resource constrained devices. In addition to providing lightweight\nauthentication and key agreement, this proposal allows any user in a group to\nmake a non-member to be a member, which is expected to be useful for autonomous\nsystems in the future. The scheme is designed in a way that the sponsors of\nsuch members can easily be recognized by anyone in the group. Unlike the other\ngroup authentication schemes based on Lagrange's polynomial interpolation, the\nproposed scheme doesn't provide a tool for adversaries to compromise the whole\ngroup secrets by using only a few members' shares as well as it allows to\nrecognize a non-member easily, which prevents service interruption attacks.",

Generative models of these data\nare of particular interest, as they enable a range of impactful downstream\napplications like simulation or creating synthetic training data. Recent work\nhas highlighted the potential of generative adversarial nets (GANs) for\ngenerating spatio-temporal data. A new GAN algorithm COT-GAN, inspired by the\ntheory of causal optimal transport (COT), was proposed in an attempt to better\ntackle this challenge. However, the task of learning more complex\nspatio-temporal patterns requires additional knowledge of their specific data\nstructures. In this study, we propose a novel loss objective combined with\nCOT-GAN based on an autoregressive embedding to reinforce the learning of\nspatio-temporal dynamics. We devise SPATE (spatio-temporal association), a new\nmetric measuring spatio-temporal autocorrelation by using the deviance of\nobservations from their expected values. We compute SPATE for real and\nsynthetic data samples and use it to compute an embedding loss that considers\nspace-time interactions, nudging the GAN to learn outputs that are faithful to\nthe observed dynamics. We test this new objective on a diverse set of complex\nspatio-temporal patterns: turbulent flows, log-Gaussian Cox processes and\nglobal weather data. We show that our novel embedding loss improves performance\nwithout any changes to the architecture of the COT-GAN backbone, highlighting\nour model's increased capacity for capturing autoregressive structures.

The commonly used asymmetric algorithms include public key\nencryption, key exchange and identity-based encryption(IBE). However, the\nnetwork security protocols based on classic identity-based encryption do not\nhave perfect forward security. To solve the problem, we construct the first\nquantum IBE (QIBE) scheme based on the learning with errors problem, and prove\nthat our scheme is fully secure under the random oracle. Moreover, we construct\nthe quantum circuit of our QIBE scheme and give an estimate of the quantum\nresource of our circuit including the numbers of Hadamard gate, phase gate, T\ngate, CNOT gate and the total qubits used in the circuit, and conclude that the\nquantum resources required by our scheme increase linearly with the number of\nbits of the encrypted quantum plaintext. Our scheme exhibits the following\nadvantages: (i) The classic key generation center (KGC) system still can be\nused for our QIBE scheme to generate and distribute the secret identity keys so\nthat the cost can be reduced when the scheme is implemented. The reason why the\nclassic KGC can be used is that the public and private keys are in the form of\nclassic bits. (ii) The network security protocols using a handshake with our\nQIBE scheme can provide perfect forward security. In our scheme, the ciphertext\nis transmitted in the form of a quantum state that is unknown to the adversary\nand therefore cannot be copied and stored.

Our key observation is\nthat though irregularly shaped objects widely exist in daily life and\nindustrial scenarios, they received little attention in the instance\nsegmentation field due to the lack of corresponding datasets. To fill this gap,\nwe propose iShape, an irregular shape dataset for instance segmentation. iShape\ncontains six sub-datasets with one real and five synthetics, each represents a\nscene of a typical irregular shape. Unlike most existing instance segmentation\ndatasets of regular objects, iShape has many characteristics that challenge\nexisting instance segmentation algorithms, such as large overlaps between\nbounding boxes of instances, extreme aspect ratios, and large numbers of\nconnected components per instance. We benchmark popular instance segmentation\nmethods on iShape and find their performance drop dramatically. Hence, we\npropose an affinity-based instance segmentation algorithm, called ASIS, as a\nstronger baseline. ASIS explicitly combines perception and reasoning to solve\nArbitrary Shape Instance Segmentation including irregular objects.

By partitioning the PLM into multiple modules, we\nminimize the reconstruction error incurred by quantization for each module. In\naddition, we design a new model parallel training strategy such that each\nmodule can be trained locally on separate computing devices without waiting for\npreceding modules, which brings nearly the theoretical training speed-up (e.g.,\n$4\\times$ on $4$ GPUs).

SSL, with a contrastive loss, is more natural\nas it does not require labelled data and its robustness to perturbations yields\nmore adaptable embeddings. Moreover the perturbation of data required to create\npositive pairs for SSL is easily produced in a natural environment by observing\nobjects in motion and with variable lighting over time. We propose a\ncontrastive hinge based loss whose error involves simple local computations as\nopposed to the standard contrastive losses employed in the literature, which do\nnot lend themselves easily to implementation in a network architecture due to\ncomplex computations involving ratios and inner products. Furthermore we show\nthat learning can be performed with one of two more plausible alternatives to\nbackpropagation. The first is difference target propagation (DTP), which trains\nnetwork parameters using target-based local losses and employs a Hebbian\nlearning rule, thus overcoming the biologically implausible symmetric weight\nproblem in backpropagation. The second is simply layer-wise learning, where\neach layer is directly connected to a layer computing the loss error. The\nlayers are either updated sequentially in a greedy fashion (GLL) or in random\norder (RLL), and each training stage involves a single hidden layer network.\nThe one step backpropagation needed for each such network can either be altered\nwith fixed random feedback weights as proposed in Lillicrap et al.

After each access we can rearrange the list, similarly to\nMove-To-Front, but dependencies need to be respected.\nWe present a 4-competitive online rearrangement algorithm, whose cost is at\nmost four times worse than the optimal offline algorithm; no deterministic\nalgorithm can be better than 3-competitive. The algorithm is simple and\nattractive, especially for memory-limited systems, as it does not require any\nadditional memory (e.g., neither timestamps nor frequency statistics). Our\napproach can simply be deployed as a drop-in replacement for a static\ndatastructure, potentially benefitting many existing networks.\nWe evaluate our self-adjusting list packet classifier on realistic ruleset\nand traffic instances. We find that our classifier performs similarly to a\nstatic list for low-locality traffic, but significantly outperforms Efficuts\n(by a factor 7x), CutSplit (3.6x), and the static list (14x) for high locality\nand small rulesets. Memory consumption is 10x lower on average compared to\nEfficuts and CutSplit.",

However, rule-based models are hard to optimize,\nespecially on large data sets, due to their discrete parameters and structures.\nEnsemble methods and fuzzy/soft rules are commonly used to improve performance,\nbut they sacrifice the model interpretability. To obtain both good scalability\nand interpretability, we propose a new classifier, named Rule-based\nRepresentation Learner (RRL), that automatically learns interpretable non-fuzzy\nrules for data representation and classification. To train the\nnon-differentiable RRL effectively, we project it to a continuous space and\npropose a novel training method, called Gradient Grafting, that can directly\noptimize the discrete model using gradient descent. An improved design of\nlogical activation functions is also devised to increase the scalability of RRL\nand enable it to discretize the continuous features end-to-end.

    "abstract": "Many important resource allocation problems involve the combinatorial\nassignment of items (e.g., combinatorial auctions, combinatorial exchanges, and\ncombinatorial course allocation). Because the bundle space grows exponentially\nin the number of items, preference elicitation is a key challenge in these\ndomains, in particular because agents may view items as substitutes or\ncomplements. Recently, researchers have proposed machine learning (ML)-based\nmechanisms that outperform traditional mechanisms while reducing preference\nelicitation costs for agents. However, one major shortcoming of the ML\nalgorithms that were used is that they ignore important prior knowledge about\nagents' preferences. To address this, we introduce monotone-value neural\nnetworks (MVNNs), which are carefully designed to capture combinatorial\nvaluations, while enforcing monotonicity (i.e., adding an item to a bundle\nweakly increases its value) and normality (i.e., the empty bundle has zero\nvalue). On a technical level, we make two main contributions. First, we prove\nthat our MVNNs are universal in the class of monotone and normalized value\nfunctions; second, we provide a mixed-integer program (MIP) formulation to make\nsolving MVNN-based winner determination problems practically feasible. We\nevaluate our MVNNs experimentally in spectrum auction domains. Our results show\nthat MVNNs improve the prediction performance when learning agents' value\nfunctions, they improve the allocative efficiency of the auction, and they also\nreduce the run-time of the winner determination problem.",

    "abstract": "Cooperatively planning for multiple agents has been proposed as a promising\nmethod for strategic and motion planning for automated vehicles. By taking into\naccount the intent of every agent, the ego agent can incorporate future\ninteractions with human-driven vehicles into its planning. The problem is often\nformulated as a multi-agent game and solved using iterative algorithms\noperating on a discretized action or state space. Even if converging to a Nash\nequilibrium, the result will often be only sub-optimal. In this paper, we\ndefine a linear differential game for a set of interacting agents and solve it\nto optimality using mixed-integer programming. A disjunctive formulation of the\norientation allows us to formulate linear constraints to prevent agent-to-agent\ncollision while preserving the non-holonomic motion properties of the vehicle\nmodel. Soft constraints account for prediction errors. We then define a joint\ncost function, where a cooperation factor can adapt between altruistic,\ncooperative, and egoistic behavior. We study the influence of the cooperation\nfactor to solve scenarios, where interaction between the agents is necessary to\nsolve them successfully. The approach is then evaluated in a racing scenario,\nwhere we show the applicability of the formulation in a closed-loop receding\nhorizon replanning fashion. By accounting for inaccuracies in the cooperative\nassumption and the actual behavior, we can indeed successfully plan an optimal\ncontrol strategy interacting closely with other agents.",

    "abstract": "In light of the success of contrastive learning in the image domain, current\nself-supervised video representation learning methods usually employ\ncontrastive loss to facilitate video representation learning. When naively\npulling two augmented views of a video closer, the model however tends to learn\nthe common static background as a shortcut but fails to capture the motion\ninformation, a phenomenon dubbed as background bias. This bias makes the model\nsuffer from weak generalization ability, leading to worse performance on\ndownstream tasks such as action recognition. To alleviate such bias, we propose\nForeground-background Merging (FAME) to deliberately compose the foreground\nregion of the selected video onto the background of others. Specifically,\nwithout any off-the-shelf detector, we extract the foreground and background\nregions via the frame difference and color statistics, and shuffle the\nbackground regions among the videos. By leveraging the semantic consistency\nbetween the original clips and the fused ones, the model focuses more on the\nforeground motion pattern and is thus more robust to the background context.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that FAME can significantly boost the\nperformance in different downstream tasks with various backbones. When\nintegrated with MoCo, FAME reaches 84.8% and 53.5% accuracy on UCF101 and\nHMDB51, respectively, achieving the state-of-the-art performance.",

    "abstract": "Recently, deep clustering methods have gained momentum because of the high\nrepresentational power of deep neural networks (DNNs) such as autoencoder. The\nkey idea is that representation learning and clustering can reinforce each\nother: Good representations lead to good clustering while good clustering\nprovides good supervisory signals to representation learning. Critical\nquestions include: 1) How to optimize representation learning and clustering?\n2) Should the reconstruction loss of autoencoder be considered always? In this\npaper, we propose DEKM (for Deep Embedded K-Means) to answer these two\nquestions. Since the embedding space generated by autoencoder may have no\nobvious cluster structures, we propose to further transform the embedding space\nto a new space that reveals the cluster-structure information. This is achieved\nby an orthonormal transformation matrix, which contains the eigenvectors of the\nwithin-class scatter matrix of K-means. The eigenvalues indicate the importance\nof the eigenvectors' contributions to the cluster-structure information in the\nnew space. Our goal is to increase the cluster-structure information. To this\nend, we discard the decoder and propose a greedy method to optimize the\nrepresentation. Representation learning and clustering are alternately\noptimized by DEKM.

    "title": "Predicting Like A Pilot: Dataset and Method to Predict Socially-Aware  Aircraft Trajectories in Non-Towered Terminal Airspace",
    "abstract": "Pilots operating aircraft in un-towered airspace rely on their situational\nawareness and prior knowledge to predict the future trajectories of other\nagents. These predictions are conditioned on the past trajectories of other\nagents, agent-agent social interactions and environmental context such as\nairport location and weather. This paper provides a dataset,\n$\\textit{TrajAir}$, that captures this behaviour in a non-towered terminal\nairspace around a regional airport. We also present a baseline socially-aware\ntrajectory prediction algorithm, $\\textit{TrajAirNet}$, that uses the dataset\nto predict the trajectories of all agents. The dataset is collected for 111\ndays over 8 months and contains ADS-B transponder data along with the\ncorresponding METAR weather data. The data is processed to be used as a\nbenchmark with other publicly available social navigation datasets. To the best\nof authors' knowledge, this is the first 3D social aerial navigation dataset\nthus introducing social navigation for autonomous aviation.\n$\\textit{TrajAirNet}$ combines state-of-the-art modules in social navigation to\nprovide predictions in a static environment with a dynamic context. Both the\n$\\textit{TrajAir}$ dataset and $\\textit{TrajAirNet}$ prediction algorithm are\nopen-source.

    "abstract": "In black-box adversarial attacks, adversaries query the deep neural network\n(DNN), use the output to reconstruct gradients, and then optimize the\nadversarial inputs iteratively. In this paper, we study the method of adding\nwhite noise to the DNN output to mitigate such attacks, with a unique focus on\nthe trade-off analysis of noise level and query cost. The attacker's query\ncount (QC) is derived mathematically as a function of noise standard deviation.\nWith this result, the defender can conveniently find the noise level needed to\nmitigate attacks for the desired security level specified by QC and limited DNN\nperformance loss. Our analysis shows that the added noise is drastically\nmagnified by the small variation of DNN outputs, which makes the reconstructed\ngradient have an extremely low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Adding slight white\nnoise with a standard deviation less than 0.01 is enough to increase QC by many\norders of magnitude without introducing any noticeable classification accuracy\nreduction. Our experiments demonstrate that this method can effectively\nmitigate both soft-label and hard-label black-box attacks under realistic QC\nconstraints. We also show that this method outperforms many other defense\nmethods and is robust to the attacker's countermeasures.",

    "title": "HSVA: Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Adaptation for Zero-Shot Learning",
    "abstract": "Zero-shot learning (ZSL) tackles the unseen class recognition problem,\ntransferring semantic knowledge from seen classes to unseen ones. Typically, to\nguarantee desirable knowledge transfer, a common (latent) space is adopted for\nassociating the visual and semantic domains in ZSL. However, existing common\nspace learning methods align the semantic and visual domains by merely\nmitigating distribution disagreement through one-step adaptation. This strategy\nis usually ineffective due to the heterogeneous nature of the feature\nrepresentations in the two domains, which intrinsically contain both\ndistribution and structure variations. To address this and advance ZSL, we\npropose a novel hierarchical semantic-visual adaptation (HSVA) framework.\nSpecifically, HSVA aligns the semantic and visual domains by adopting a\nhierarchical two-step adaptation, i.e., structure adaptation and distribution\nadaptation. In the structure adaptation step, we take two task-specific\nencoders to encode the source data (visual domain) and the target data\n(semantic domain) into a structure-aligned common space. To this end, a\nsupervised adversarial discrepancy (SAD) module is proposed to adversarially\nminimize the discrepancy between the predictions of two task-specific\nclassifiers, thus making the visual and semantic feature manifolds more closely\naligned. In the distribution adaptation step, we directly minimize the\nWasserstein distance between the latent multivariate Gaussian distributions to\nalign the visual and semantic distributions using a common encoder. Finally,\nthe structure and distribution adaptation are derived in a unified framework\nunder two partially-aligned variational autoencoders. Extensive experiments on\nfour benchmark datasets demonstrate that HSVA achieves superior performance on\nboth conventional and generalized ZSL.

    "abstract": "Some cognitive research has discovered that humans accomplish event\nsegmentation as a side effect of event anticipation. Inspired by this\ndiscovery, we propose a simple yet effective end-to-end self-supervised\nlearning framework for event segmentation/boundary detection. Unlike the\nmainstream clustering-based methods, our framework exploits a transformer-based\nfeature reconstruction scheme to detect event boundary by reconstruction\nerrors. This is consistent with the fact that humans spot new events by\nleveraging the deviation between their prediction and what is actually\nperceived. Thanks to their heterogeneity in semantics, the frames at boundaries\nare difficult to be reconstructed (generally with large reconstruction errors),\nwhich is favorable for event boundary detection. Additionally, since the\nreconstruction occurs on the semantic feature level instead of pixel level, we\ndevelop a temporal contrastive feature embedding module to learn the semantic\nvisual representation for frame feature reconstruction. This procedure is like\nhumans building up experiences with \"long-term memory\". The goal of our work is\nto segment generic events rather than localize some specific ones. We focus on\nachieving accurate event boundaries. As a result, we adopt F1 score\n(Precision/Recall) as our primary evaluation metric for a fair comparison with\nprevious approaches. Meanwhile, we also calculate the conventional frame-based\nMoF and IoU metric. We thoroughly benchmark our work on four publicly available\ndatasets and demonstrate much better results.",

    "abstract": "Blind spots or outright deceit can bedevil and deceive machine learning\nmodels. Unidentified objects such as digital \"stickers,\" also known as\nadversarial patches, can fool facial recognition systems, surveillance systems\nand self-driving cars. Fortunately, most existing adversarial patches can be\noutwitted, disabled and rejected by a simple classification network called an\nadversarial patch detector, which distinguishes adversarial patches from\noriginal images. An object detector classifies and predicts the types of\nobjects within an image, such as by distinguishing a motorcyclist from the\nmotorcycle, while also localizing each object's placement within the image by\n\"drawing\" so-called bounding boxes around each object, once again separating\nthe motorcyclist from the motorcycle. To train detectors even better, however,\nwe need to keep subjecting them to confusing or deceitful adversarial patches\nas we probe for the models' blind spots. For such probes, we came up with a\nnovel approach, a Low-Detectable Adversarial Patch, which attacks an object\ndetector with small and texture-consistent adversarial patches, making these\nadversaries less likely to be recognized. Concretely, we use several geometric\nprimitives to model the shapes and positions of the patches. To enhance our\nattack performance, we also assign different weights to the bounding boxes in\nterms of loss function. Our experiments on the common detection dataset COCO as\nwell as the driving-video dataset D2-City show that LDAP is an effective attack\nmethod, and can resist the adversarial patch detector.",

    "abstract": "The idea of social advertising (or social promotion) is to select a group of\ninfluential individuals (a.k.a \\emph{seeds}) to help promote some products or\nideas through an online social networks. There are two major players in the\nsocial advertising ecosystem: advertiser and platform. The platform sells viral\nengagements such as \"like\"s to advertisers by inserting their ads into the feed\nof seeds. These seeds receive monetary incentives from the platform in exchange\nfor their participation in the social advertising campaign. Once an ad is\nengaged by a follower of some seed, the platform receives a fixed amount of\npayment, called cost per engagement, from the advertiser. The ad could\npotentially attract more engagements from followers' followers and trigger a\nviral contagion. At the beginning of a campaign, the advertiser submits a\nbudget to the platform and this budget can be used for two purposes: recruiting\nseeds and paying for the viral engagements generated by the seeds. Note that\nthe first part of payment goes to the seeds and the latter one is the actual\nrevenue collected by the platform. In this setting, the problem for the\nplatform is to recruit a group of seeds such that she can collect the largest\npossible amount of revenue subject to the budget constraint. We formulate this\nproblem as a seed selection problem whose objective function is non-monotone\nand it might take on negative values, making existing results on submodular\noptimization and influence maximization not applicable to our setting. We study\nthis problem under both non-adaptive and adaptive settings.

    "abstract": "The existing tensor networks adopt conventional matrix product for\nconnection. The classical matrix product requires strict dimensionality\nconsistency between factors, which can result in redundancy in data\nrepresentation. In this paper, the semi-tensor product is used to generalize\nclassical matrix product-based mode product to semi-tensor mode product. As it\npermits the connection of two factors with different dimensionality, more\nflexible and compact tensor decompositions can be obtained with smaller sizes\nof factors. Tucker decomposition, Tensor Train (TT) and Tensor Ring (TR) are\ncommon decomposition for low rank compression of deep neural networks. The\nsemi-tensor product is applied to these tensor decompositions to obtained their\ngeneralized versions, i.e., semi-tensor Tucker decomposition (STTu),\nsemi-tensor train(STT) and semi-tensor ring (STR). Experimental results show\nthe STTu, STT and STR achieve higher compression factors than the conventional\ntensor decompositions with the same accuracy but less training times in ResNet\nand WideResNetcompression. With 2% accuracy degradation, the TT-RN (rank = 14)\nand the TR-WRN (rank = 16) only obtain 3 times and99t times compression factors\nwhile the STT-RN (rank = 14) and the STR-WRN (rank = 16) achieve 9 times and\n179 times compression factors, respectively.",

In\nsecond-generation blockchains such as Ethereum the ledger is coupled with smart\ncontracts, which enable the automation of transactions associated with\nagreements between the parties of a financial or commercial nature. The\ncoupling of smart contracts and ledgers provides the technological background\nfor very innovative application areas, such as Decentralized Autonomous\nOrganizations (DAOs), Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and Decentralized Finance\n(DeFi), which propelled blockchains beyond cryptocurrencies that were the only\nfocus of first generation blockchains such as the Bitcoin. However, the\ncurrently used implementation of smart contracts as arbitrary programming\nconstructs has made them susceptible to dangerous bugs that can be exploited\nmaliciously and has moved their semantics away from that of legal contracts. We\npropose here to recompose the split and recover the reliability of databases by\nformalizing a notion of contract modelled as a finite-state automaton with\nwell-defined computational characteristics derived from an encoding in terms of\nallocations of resources to actors, as an alternative to the approach based on\nprogramming.

If other\nmovable obstacles occlude the target, more than one object should be relocated\nto clear the path to reach the target object. With two robots, the relocation\ncould be done efficiently by simultaneously performing relocation tasks.\nHowever, the precedence constraint between the tasks (e.g, some objects at the\nfront should be removed to manipulate the objects in the back) makes the\nsimultaneous task execution difficult.\nWe propose a coordination method that determines which robot relocates which\nobject so as to perform tasks simultaneously. Given a set of objects to be\nrelocated, the objective is to maximize the number of turn-takings of the\nrobots in performing relocation tasks. Thus, one robot can pick an object in\nthe clutter while the other robot places an object in hand to the outside of\nthe clutter. However, the object to be relocated may not be accessible to all\nrobots, so taking turns could not always be achieved. Our method is based on\nthe optimal uniform-cost search so the number of turn-takings is proven to be\nmaximized. We also propose a greedy variant whose computation time is shorter.\nFrom experiments, we show that our method reduces the completion time of the\nmission by at least 22.9% (at most 27.3%) compared to the methods with no\nconsideration of turn-taking.",

Instead, in such applications, a set of options is\npresented sequentially to the learner within a time span, and this process is\nrepeated throughout a time horizon. At each time, the learner is asked whether\nto select the proposed option or not. We define this scenario as the Sequential\nPull/No-pull Bandit setting, and we propose a meta-algorithm, namely Sequential\nPull/No-pull for MAB (Seq), to adapt any classical MAB policy to better suit\nthis setting for both the regret minimization and best-arm identification\nproblems. By allowing the selection of multiple arms within a round, the\nproposed meta-algorithm gathers more information, especially in the first\nrounds, characterized by a high uncertainty in the arms estimate value. At the\nsame time, the adapted algorithms provide the same theoretical guarantees as\nthe classical policy employed.

    "abstract": "Systematic compositionality is an essential mechanism in human language,\nallowing the recombination of known parts to create novel expressions. However,\nexisting neural models have been shown to lack this basic ability in learning\nsymbolic structures. Motivated by the failure of a Transformer model on the\nSCAN compositionality challenge (Lake and Baroni, 2018), which requires parsing\na command into actions, we propose two auxiliary sequence prediction tasks that\ntrack the progress of function and argument semantics, as additional training\nsupervision. These automatically-generated sequences are more representative of\nthe underlying compositional symbolic structures of the input data. During\ninference, the model jointly predicts the next action and the next tokens in\nthe auxiliary sequences at each step. Experiments on the SCAN dataset show that\nour method encourages the Transformer to understand compositional structures of\nthe command, improving its accuracy on multiple challenging splits from <= 10%\nto 100%. With only 418 (5%) training instances, our approach still achieves\n97.8% accuracy on the MCD1 split. Therefore, we argue that compositionality can\nbe induced in Transformers given minimal but proper guidance. We also show that\na better result is achieved using less contextualized vectors as the\nattention's query, providing insights into architecture choices in achieving\nsystematic compositionality.

One main challenge confronting practical FL\nis that resource constrained devices struggle with the computation intensive\ntask of updating of a deep-neural network model. To tackle the challenge, in\nthis paper, a federated dropout (FedDrop) scheme is proposed building on the\nclassic dropout scheme for random model pruning. Specifically, in each\niteration of the FL algorithm, several subnets are independently generated from\nthe global model at the server using dropout but with heterogeneous dropout\nrates (i.e., parameter-pruning probabilities), each of which is adapted to the\nstate of an assigned channel. The subsets are downloaded to associated devices\nfor updating. Thereby, FdeDrop reduces both the communication overhead and\ndevices' computation loads compared with the conventional FL while\noutperforming the latter in the case of overfitting and also the FL scheme with\nuniform dropout (i.e., identical subsets).",

In this work, we model the corresponding\ninteraction sequence as a Markov decision process (MDP) that is solved by deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms to define the PCAM system's policy. The\nsimulated driving scenario is based on an AV acting as a DRL agent driving\nalong an urban street, facing a pedestrian at an unmarked crosswalk who tries\nto cross. Since modeling realistic crossing behavior of the pedestrian is\nchallenging, we introduce two levels of intelligent pedestrian behavior: While\nthe baseline model follows a predefined strategy, our advanced model captures\ncontinuous learning and the inherent uncertainty in human behavior by defining\nthe pedestrian as a second DRL agent, i.e., we introduce a deep multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (DMARL) problem. The presented PCAM system with\ndifferent levels of intelligent pedestrian behavior is benchmarked according to\nthe agents' collision rate and the resulting traffic flow efficiency. In this\nanalysis, our focus lies on evaluating the influence of observation noise on\nthe decision making of the agents. The results show that the AV is able to\ncompletely mitigate collisions under the majority of the investigated\nconditions and that the DRL-based pedestrian model indeed learns a more\nhuman-like crossing behavior.",

While\ncurrently available high-performance computing environments support well this\ncomplexity, the deployment of AI models in mobile devices, which is an\nincreasing trend, is challenging. Mobile applications consist of environments\nwith low computational resources and hence imply limitations in the design\ndecisions during the AI-enabled software engineering lifecycle that balance the\ntrade-off between the accuracy and the complexity of the mobile applications.\nObjective: Our objective is to systematically assess the trade-off between\naccuracy and complexity when deploying complex AI models (e.g. neural networks)\nto mobile devices, which have an implicit resource limitation. We aim to cover\n(i) the impact of the design decisions on the achievement of high-accuracy and\nlow resource-consumption implementations; and (ii) the validation of profiling\ntools for systematically promoting greener AI.\nMethod: This confirmatory registered report consists of a plan to conduct an\nempirical study to quantify the implications of the design decisions on\nAI-enabled applications performance and to report experiences of the end-to-end\nAI-enabled software engineering lifecycle. Concretely, we will implement both\nimage-based and language-based neural networks in mobile applications to solve\nmultiple image classification and text classification problems on different\nbenchmark datasets. Overall, we plan to model the accuracy and complexity of\nAI-enabled applications in operation with respect to their design decisions and\nwill provide tools for allowing practitioners to gain consciousness of the\nquantitative relationship between the design decisions and the green\ncharacteristics of study.",

Unlike the existing\nranking distillation work which pursues a good trade-off between performance\nand efficiency, BAR adapts the idea of Born Again Networks (BAN) to ranking\nproblems and significantly improves ranking performance of students over the\nteacher rankers without increasing model capacity. The key differences between\nBAR and common distillation techniques for classification are: (1) an\nappropriate teacher score transformation function, and (2) a novel listwise\ndistillation framework. Both techniques are specifically designed for ranking\nproblems and are rarely studied in the knowledge distillation literature. Using\nthe state-of-the-art neural ranking structure, BAR is able to push the limits\nof neural rankers above a recent rigorous benchmark study and significantly\noutperforms traditionally strong gradient boosted decision tree based models on\n7 out of 9 key metrics, the first time in the literature.

    "abstract": "Scene understanding is a pivotal task for autonomous vehicles to safely\nnavigate in the environment. Recent advances in deep learning enable accurate\nsemantic reconstruction of the surroundings from LiDAR data. However, these\nmodels encounter a large domain gap while deploying them on vehicles equipped\nwith different LiDAR setups which drastically decreases their performance.\nFine-tuning the model for every new setup is infeasible due to the expensive\nand cumbersome process of recording and manually labeling new data.\nUnsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) techniques are thus essential to fill this\ndomain gap and retain the performance of models on new sensor setups without\nthe need for additional data labeling. In this paper, we propose AdaptLPS, a\nnovel UDA approach for LiDAR panoptic segmentation that leverages task-specific\nknowledge and accounts for variation in the number of scan lines, mounting\nposition, intensity distribution, and environmental conditions. We tackle the\nUDA task by employing two complementary domain adaptation strategies,\ndata-based and model-based. While data-based adaptations reduce the domain gap\nby processing the raw LiDAR scans to resemble the scans in the target domain,\nmodel-based techniques guide the network in extracting features that are\nrepresentative for both domains. Extensive evaluations on three pairs of\nreal-world autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that AdaptLPS outperforms\nexisting UDA approaches by up to 6.41 pp in terms of the PQ score.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to analyze the impact of electronic word-of-mouth\n(eWoM) marketing on branding attitude in social networks. We treated eWOM\nactivities on brand awareness, brand destruction, branding, brand image, and\nbrand competition. The data was gathered through the followers of Wiesland shoe\npage on Instagram's social network. We conduct the statistical analysis by Spss\nsoftware and apply SmartPls software to test the hypotheses. The results\nconfirm that eWoM plays a significant and positive role in branding, brand\nimage, and brand awareness whereas it does not have an influence on brand\ndestruction. On the other hand, branding and brand destruction play a crucial\nrole in gaining a competitive advantage. Therefore, the brand relationship is\nenhanced through eWOM activities.",

This leads to an increased need for efficiency in\nthe development of embedded devices and systems composed thereof. Hybrid\ntestbeds are common environments to representatively assess, e.g.,\nhardware-software interaction, interoperability, and scalability. Although\nautomation is inevitable to achieve efficiency, not all devices offer\ninterfaces to be fully software-controlled. Most notably, block devices tend to\nbe inaccessible for software outside a Device under Test (DuT), especially when\nthe latter is in a dysfunctional state.\nThis paper introduces the Networked SD card (NetSD) which enables remote\naccess to removable block devices. The proposed system consists of a hardware\npart, which enables multiplexed access to a block device (e.g., an SD card) and\na software part which enables remote access to the block device (e.g., via HTTP\nor network block device). NetSD thus adds testing and automation possibilities\nto DuTs without the need to modify their hard- or software. During the hardware\ndesign, we fund that different SD transfer modes and access profiles (read or\nwrite focus) benefit from different pull-up resistor configurations for the\ndata lines.",

Clinical recovery in these domains is tracked using a wide\nrange of measures that may be continuous, ordinal, interval or categorical in\nnature, which presents challenges for standard multivariate regression\napproaches. This has hindered stroke researchers' ability to achieve an\nintegrated picture of the complex time-evolving interactions amongst symptoms.\nHere we use tools from network science and machine learning that are\nparticularly well-suited to extracting underlying patterns in such data, and\nmay assist in prediction of recovery patterns. To demonstrate the utility of\nthis approach, we analyzed data from the NINDS tPA trial using the Trajectory\nProfile Clustering (TPC) method to identify distinct stroke recovery patterns\nfor 11 different neurological domains at 5 discrete time points. Our analysis\nidentified 3 distinct stroke trajectory profiles that align with clinically\nrelevant stroke syndromes, characterized both by distinct clusters of symptoms,\nas well as differing degrees of symptom severity. We then validated our\napproach using graph neural networks to determine how well our model performed\npredictively for stratifying patients into these trajectory profiles at early\nvs. later time points post-stroke. We demonstrate that trajectory profile\nclustering is an effective method for identifying clinically relevant recovery\nsubtypes in multidimensional longitudinal datasets, and for early prediction of\nsymptom progression subtypes in individual patients. This paper is the first\nwork introducing network trajectory approaches for stroke recovery phenotyping,\nand is aimed at enhancing the translation of such novel computational\napproaches for practical clinical application.",

    "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease characterized\nby relapsing inflammation of the large intestine. The severity of UC is often\nrepresented by the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) which quantifies mucosal\ndisease activity from endoscopy videos. In clinical trials, an endoscopy video\nis assigned an MES based upon the most severe disease activity observed in the\nvideo. For this reason, severe inflammation spread throughout the colon will\nreceive the same MES as an otherwise healthy colon with severe inflammation\nrestricted to a small, localized segment. Therefore, the extent of disease\nactivity throughout the large intestine, and overall response to treatment, may\nnot be completely captured by the MES. In this work, we aim to automatically\nestimate UC severity for each frame in an endoscopy video to provide a higher\nresolution assessment of disease activity throughout the colon. Because\nannotating severity at the frame-level is expensive, labor-intensive, and\nhighly subjective, we propose a novel weakly supervised, ordinal classification\nmethod to estimate frame severity from video MES labels alone. Using clinical\ntrial data, we first achieved 0.92 and 0.90 AUC for predicting mucosal healing\nand remission of UC, respectively. Then, for severity estimation, we\ndemonstrate that our models achieve substantial Cohen's Kappa agreement with\nground truth MES labels, comparable to the inter-rater agreement of expert\nclinicians. These findings indicate that our framework could serve as a\nfoundation for novel clinical endpoints, based on a more localized scoring\nsystem, to better evaluate UC drug efficacy in clinical trials.",

This measure is based on the idea of matching distributions\nthat only overlap over a portion of their region of support. Our proposed\nmeasure is inspired by MPdist which has been previously proposed for such\ndatasets and is constructed using Euclidean metrics, whereas kdiff is\nconstructed using non-linear kernel distances. Also, kdiff accounts for both\nself and cross similarities across the instances and is defined using a lower\nquantile of the distance distribution. Comparing the cross similarity to self\nsimilarity allows for measures of similarity that are more robust to noise and\npartial occlusions of the relevant signals. Our proposed measure kdiff is a\nmore general form of the well known kernel-based Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)\ndistance estimated over the embeddings. Some theoretical results are provided\nfor separability conditions using kdiff as a distance measure for clustering\nand classification problems where the embedding distributions can be modeled as\ntwo component mixtures. Applications are demonstrated for clustering of\nsynthetic and real-life time series and image data, and the performance of\nkdiff is compared to competing distance measures for clustering.",

To\naddress this issue, we consider a two-time-scale update scheme, where one scale\nis used to estimate the true gradient from the Markovian samples and the other\nscale is used to update the decision variable with the estimated gradient.\nWhile these two iterates are implemented simultaneously, the former is updated\n\"faster\" (using bigger step sizes) than the latter (using smaller step sizes).\nOur first contribution is to characterize the finite-time complexity of the\nproposed two-time-scale stochastic gradient method.

    "abstract": "In the past few years, deep learning (DL) models have drawn great attention\nand shown superior performance on brain tumor and subregion segmentation tasks.\nHowever, the success is limited to segmentation of adult gliomas, where\nsufficient data have been collected, manually labeled, and published for\ntraining DL models. It is still challenging to segment pediatric tumors,\nbecause the appearances are different from adult gliomas. Hence, directly\napplying a pretained DL model on pediatric data usually generates unacceptable\nresults. Because pediatric data is very limited, both labeled and unlabeled, we\npresent a brain tumor segmentation model that is based on knowledge rather than\nlearning from data. We also provide segmentation of more subregions for super\nheterogeneous tumor like atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (ATRT). Our proposed\napproach showed superior performance on both whole tumor and subregion\nsegmentation tasks to DL based models on our pediatric data when training data\nis not available for transfer learning.",

    "abstract": "In this research project, we put forward an advanced method for airway\nsegmentation based on the existent convolutional neural network (CNN) and graph\nneural network (GNN). The method is originated from the vessel segmentation,\nbut we ameliorate it and enable the novel model to perform better for datasets\nfrom computed tomography (CT) scans. Current methods for airway segmentation\nare considering the regular grid only. No matter what the detailed model is,\nincluding the 3-dimensional CNN or 2-dimensional CNN in three directions, the\noverall graph structures are not taken into consideration. In our model, with\nthe neighbourhoods of airway taken into account, the graph structure is\nincorporated and the segmentation of airways are improved compared with the\ntraditional CNN methods. We perform experiments on the chest CT scans, where\nthe ground truth segmentation labels are produced manually. The proposed model\nshows that compared with the CNN-only method, the combination of CNN and GNN\nhas a better performance in that the bronchi in the chest CT scans can be\ndetected in most cases. In addition, the model we propose has a wide extension\nsince the architecture is also utilitarian in fulfilling similar aims in other\ndatasets.

    "abstract": "Motion estimation is a fundamental step in dynamic medical image processing\nfor the assessment of target organ anatomy and function. However, existing\nimage-based motion estimation methods, which optimize the motion field by\nevaluating the local image similarity, are prone to produce implausible\nestimation, especially in the presence of large motion. In this study, we\nprovide a novel motion estimation framework of Dense-Sparse-Dense (DSD), which\ncomprises two stages. In the first stage, we process the raw dense image to\nextract sparse landmarks to represent the target organ anatomical topology and\ndiscard the redundant information that is unnecessary for motion estimation.\nFor this purpose, we introduce an unsupervised 3D landmark detection network to\nextract spatially sparse but representative landmarks for the target organ\nmotion estimation. In the second stage, we derive the sparse motion\ndisplacement from the extracted sparse landmarks of two images of different\ntime points. Then, we present a motion reconstruction network to construct the\nmotion field by projecting the sparse landmarks displacement back into the\ndense image domain. Furthermore, we employ the estimated motion field from our\ntwo-stage DSD framework as initialization and boost the motion estimation\nquality in light-weight yet effective iterative optimization. We evaluate our\nmethod on two dynamic medical imaging tasks to model cardiac motion and lung\nrespiratory motion, respectively. Our method has produced superior motion\nestimation accuracy compared to existing comparative methods. Besides, the\nextensive experimental results demonstrate that our solution can extract well\nrepresentative anatomical landmarks without any requirement of manual\nannotation.

    "abstract": "A speaker extraction algorithm seeks to extract the target speaker's voice\nfrom a multi-talker speech mixture. An auxiliary reference, such as a video\nrecording or a pre-recorded speech, is usually used as a cue to form a top-down\nauditory attention. The prior studies are focused mostly on speaker extraction\nfrom a multi-talker speech mixture with highly overlapping speakers. However, a\nmulti-talker speech mixture is often sparsely overlapped, furthermore, the\ntarget speaker could even be absent sometimes. In this paper, we propose a\nuniversal speaker extraction network that works for all multi-talker scenarios,\nwhere the target speaker can be either absent or present. When the target\nspeaker is present, the network performs over a wide range of\ntarget-interference speaker overlapping ratios, from 0% to 100%. The speech in\nsuch universal multi-talker scenarios is generally described as sparsely\noverlapped speech. We advocate that a visual cue, i.e. lips movement, is more\ninformative to serve as the auxiliary reference than an audio cue, i.e.\npre-recorded speech. In addition, we propose a scenario-aware differentiated\nloss function for network training. The experimental results show that our\nproposed network outperforms various competitive baselines in disentangling\nsparsely overlapped speech in terms of signal fidelity and perceptual\nevaluations.",

    "abstract": "Health professionals extensively use Two- Dimensional (2D) Ultrasound (US)\nvideos and images to visualize and measure internal organs for various purposes\nincluding evaluation of muscle architectural changes. US images can be used to\nmeasure abdominal muscles dimensions for the diagnosis and creation of\ncustomized treatment plans for patients with Low Back Pain (LBP), however, they\nare difficult to interpret. Due to high variability, skilled professionals with\nspecialized training are required to take measurements to avoid low\nintra-observer reliability. This variability stems from the challenging nature\nof accurately finding the correct spatial location of measurement endpoints in\nabdominal US images. In this paper, we use a Deep Learning (DL) approach to\nautomate the measurement of the abdominal muscle thickness in 2D US images. By\ntreating the problem as a localization task, we develop a modified Fully\nConvolutional Network (FCN) architecture to generate blobs of coordinate\nlocations of measurement endpoints, similar to what a human operator does. We\ndemonstrate that using the TrA400 US image dataset, our network achieves a Mean\nAbsolute Error (MAE) of 0.3125 on the test set, which almost matches the\nperformance of skilled ultrasound technicians.

These systems could\nincrease the safety of the operation through context-sensitive warnings and\nsemi-autonomous robotic assistance or improve training of surgeons via\ndata-driven feedback. In surgical workflow analysis up to 91% average precision\nhas been reported for phase recognition on an open data single-center dataset.\nIn this work we investigated the generalizability of phase recognition\nalgorithms in a multi-center setting including more difficult recognition tasks\nsuch as surgical action and surgical skill. METHODS: To achieve this goal, a\ndataset with 33 laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos from three surgical centers\nwith a total operation time of 22 hours was created. Labels included annotation\nof seven surgical phases with 250 phase transitions, 5514 occurences of four\nsurgical actions, 6980 occurences of 21 surgical instruments from seven\ninstrument categories and 495 skill classifications in five skill dimensions.\nThe dataset was used in the 2019 Endoscopic Vision challenge, sub-challenge for\nsurgical workflow and skill analysis. Here, 12 teams submitted their machine\nlearning algorithms for recognition of phase, action, instrument and/or skill\nassessment. RESULTS: F1-scores were achieved for phase recognition between\n23.9% and 67.7% (n=9 teams), for instrument presence detection between 38.5%\nand 63.8% (n=8 teams), but for action recognition only between 21.8% and 23.3%\n(n=5 teams). The average absolute error for skill assessment was 0.78 (n=1\nteam). CONCLUSION: Surgical workflow and skill analysis are promising\ntechnologies to support the surgical team, but are not solved yet, as shown by\nour comparison of algorithms.

    "abstract": "Recent researches on stock prediction using deep learning methods has been\nactively studied. This is the task to predict the movement of stock prices in\nthe future based on historical trends. The approach to predicting the movement\nbased solely on the pattern of the historical movement of it on charts, not on\nfundamental values, is called the Technical Analysis, which can be divided into\nunivariate and multivariate methods in the regression task. According to the\nlatter approach, it is important to select different factors well as inputs to\nenhance the performance of the model. Moreover, its performance can depend on\nwhich loss is used to train the model. However, most studies tend to focus on\nbuilding the structures of models, not on how to select informative factors as\ninputs to train them. In this paper, we propose a method that can get better\nperformance in terms of returns when selecting informative factors using the\ncointegration test and learning the model using quantile loss. We compare the\ntwo RNN variants with quantile loss with only five factors obtained through the\ncointegration test among the entire 15 stock index factors collected in the\nexperiment. The Cumulative return and Sharpe ratio were used to evaluate the\nperformance of trained models. Our experimental results show that our proposed\nmethod outperforms the other conventional approaches.",

    "abstract": "Most of the existing neural video compression methods adopt the predictive\ncoding framework, which first generates the predicted frame and then encodes\nits residue with the current frame. However, as for compression ratio,\npredictive coding is only a sub-optimal solution as it uses simple subtraction\noperation to remove the redundancy across frames. In this paper, we propose a\ndeep contextual video compression framework to enable a paradigm shift from\npredictive coding to conditional coding. In particular, we try to answer the\nfollowing questions: how to define, use, and learn condition under a deep video\ncompression framework. To tap the potential of conditional coding, we propose\nusing feature domain context as condition. This enables us to leverage the high\ndimension context to carry rich information to both the encoder and the\ndecoder, which helps reconstruct the high-frequency contents for higher video\nquality. Our framework is also extensible, in which the condition can be\nflexibly designed. Experiments show that our method can significantly\noutperform the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep video compression methods.\nWhen compared with x265 using veryslow preset, we can achieve 26.0% bitrate\nsaving for 1080P standard test videos.",

    "abstract": "The stock market is volatile and complicated, especially in 2020. Because of\na series of global and regional \"black swans,\" such as the COVID-19 pandemic,\nthe U.S. stock market triggered the circuit breaker three times within one week\nof March 9 to 16, which is unprecedented throughout history. Affected by the\nwhole circumstance, the stock prices of individual corporations also plummeted\nby rates that were never predicted by any pre-developed forecasting models. It\nreveals that there was a lack of satisfactory models that could predict the\nchanges in stocks prices when catastrophic, highly unlikely events occur. To\nfill the void of such models and to help prevent investors from heavy losses\nduring uncertain times, this paper aims to capture the movement pattern of\nstock prices under anomalous circumstances. First, we detect outliers in\nsequential stock prices by fitting a standard ARIMA model and identifying the\npoints where predictions deviate significantly from actual values. With the\nselected data points, we train ARIMA and LSTM models at the single-stock level,\nindustry level, and general market level, respectively. Since the public moods\naffect the stock market tremendously, a sentiment analysis is also incorporated\ninto the models in the form of sentiment scores, which are converted from\ncomments about specific stocks on Reddit. Based on 100 companies' stock prices\nin the period of 2016 to 2020, the models achieve an average prediction\naccuracy of 98% which can be used to optimize existing prediction\nmethodologies.",

In this study, a new method is proposed to objectively and\nautomatically assess heart and lung signal quality on a 5-level scale in\nreal-time and to assess the effect of signal quality on vital sign estimation.\nFor the evaluation, a total of 207 10s long chest sounds were taken from 119\npreterm and full-term babies. Thirty of the recordings from ten subjects were\nobtained with synchronous vital signs from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit\n(NICU) based on electrocardiogram recordings. As reference, seven annotators\nindependently assessed the signal quality. For automatic quality\nclassification, 400 features were extracted from the chest sounds. After\nfeature selection using minimum redundancy and maximum relevancy algorithm,\nclass balancing, and hyper-parameter optimization, a variety of multi-class and\nordinal classification and regression algorithms were trained. Then, heart rate\nand breathing rate were automatically estimated from the chest sounds using\nadapted pre-existing methods.

    "title": "Causal Matrix Completion",
    "abstract": "Matrix completion is the study of recovering an underlying matrix from a\nsparse subset of noisy observations. Traditionally, it is assumed that the\nentries of the matrix are \"missing completely at random\" (MCAR), i.e., each\nentry is revealed at random, independent of everything else, with uniform\nprobability. This is likely unrealistic due to the presence of \"latent\nconfounders\", i.e., unobserved factors that determine both the entries of the\nunderlying matrix and the missingness pattern in the observed matrix. For\nexample, in the context of movie recommender systems -- a canonical application\nfor matrix completion -- a user who vehemently dislikes horror films is\nunlikely to ever watch horror films. In general, these confounders yield\n\"missing not at random\" (MNAR) data, which can severely impact any inference\nprocedure that does not correct for this bias. We develop a formal causal model\nfor matrix completion through the language of potential outcomes, and provide\nnovel identification arguments for a variety of causal estimands of interest.\nWe design a procedure, which we call \"synthetic nearest neighbors\" (SNN), to\nestimate these causal estimands. We prove finite-sample consistency and\nasymptotic normality of our estimator. Our analysis also leads to new\ntheoretical results for the matrix completion literature. In particular, we\nestablish entry-wise, i.e., max-norm, finite-sample consistency and asymptotic\nnormality results for matrix completion with MNAR data. As a special case, this\nalso provides entry-wise bounds for matrix completion with MCAR data. Across\nsimulated and real data, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed estimator.",

    "abstract": "Non-autoregressive text-to-speech (NAR-TTS) models such as FastSpeech 2 and\nGlow-TTS can synthesize high-quality speech from the given text in parallel.\nAfter analyzing two kinds of generative NAR-TTS models (VAE and normalizing\nflow), we find that: VAE is good at capturing the long-range semantics features\n(e.g., prosody) even with small model size but suffers from blurry and\nunnatural results; and normalizing flow is good at reconstructing the frequency\nbin-wise details but performs poorly when the number of model parameters is\nlimited. Inspired by these observations, to generate diverse speech with\nnatural details and rich prosody using a lightweight architecture, we propose\nPortaSpeech, a portable and high-quality generative text-to-speech model.\nSpecifically, 1) to model both the prosody and mel-spectrogram details\naccurately, we adopt a lightweight VAE with an enhanced prior followed by a\nflow-based post-net with strong conditional inputs as the main architecture. 2)\nTo further compress the model size and memory footprint, we introduce the\ngrouped parameter sharing mechanism to the affine coupling layers in the\npost-net. 3) To improve the expressiveness of synthesized speech and reduce the\ndependency on accurate fine-grained alignment between text and speech, we\npropose a linguistic encoder with mixture alignment combining hard inter-word\nalignment and soft intra-word alignment, which explicitly extracts word-level\nsemantic information. Experimental results show that PortaSpeech outperforms\nother TTS models in both voice quality and prosody modeling in terms of\nsubjective and objective evaluation metrics, and shows only a slight\nperformance degradation when reducing the model parameters to 6.7M (about 4x\nmodel size and 3x runtime memory compression ratio compared with FastSpeech 2).\nOur extensive ablation studies demonstrate that each design in PortaSpeech is\neffective.",

Compared to variational\nartificial neural networks using Markov chain Monte Carlo for sample\ngeneration, this approach has the advantage that the neuromorphic device\ngenerates samples in a fast and inherently parallel fashion. We develop a\ntraining algorithm and apply it to the transverse field Ising model, showing\ngood performance at moderate system sizes ($N\\leq 10$). A systematic\nhyperparameter study shows that scalability to larger system sizes mainly\ndepends on sample quality which is limited by parameter drifts on the analog\nneuromorphic chip. The learning performance shows a threshold behavior as a\nfunction of the number of variational parameters of the ansatz, with\napproximately $50$ hidden neurons being sufficient for representing critical\nground states up to $N=10$.

    "abstract": "Separating overlapped nuclei is a major challenge in histopathology image\nanalysis. Recently published approaches have achieved promising overall\nperformance on nuclei segmentation; however, their performance on separating\noverlapped nuclei is quite limited. To address the issue, we propose a novel\nmultitask learning network with a bending loss regularizer to separate\noverlapped nuclei accurately. The newly proposed multitask learning\narchitecture enhances the generalization by learning shared representation from\nthree tasks: instance segmentation, nuclei distance map prediction, and\noverlapped nuclei distance map prediction. The proposed bending loss defines\nhigh penalties to concave contour points with large curvatures, and applies\nsmall penalties to convex contour points with small curvatures. Minimizing the\nbending loss avoids generating contours that encompass multiple nuclei. In\naddition, two new quantitative metrics, Aggregated Jaccard Index of overlapped\nnuclei (AJIO) and Accuracy of overlapped nuclei (ACCO), are designed for the\nevaluation of overlapped nuclei segmentation. We validate the proposed approach\non the CoNSeP and MoNuSegv1 datasets using seven quantitative metrics:\nAggregate Jaccard Index, Dice, Segmentation Quality, Recognition Quality,\nPanoptic Quality, AJIO, and ACCO. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the\nproposed Bend-Net outperforms eight state-of-the-art approaches.",
